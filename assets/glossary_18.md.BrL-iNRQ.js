The state-owned enterprise was at the time known as the Ceylon Transport Board. At its peak, it was the largest omnibus company in the world - with about 7,000 buses and over 50,000 employees. With privatization in 1979, it underwent a period of decline. First broken up into several regional boards, then into several companies, it was finally reconstituted as the Sri Lanka Transport Board in 2005.  Origins  The first motor omnibus in Sri Lanka was imported in 1907, and bus transport began in Sri Lanka as an owner-operated service. There was no regulation, so when more than one bus operated on a single route there was a scramble for the load, which might end in fisticuffs or even stabbings. By the mid-1930s, malpractices in pursuit of maximum profit began to compromise safety and comfort. The setting up of the limited liability omnibus companies by the British around 1940 was the first meaningful step in regularising public passenger transport in the country. Controlling legislation was strengthened in 1951 with the introduction of a system of quantity and quality licensing, similar to what then applied in Great Britain. Nevertheless, conditions again deteriorated. The earliest buses plied on the main routes only and had open bodies. Passengers got in from both sides of the bus and through a door at the back. The openings were covered with buttoned down leather cloth which could be rolled up when necessary. The Nelson Commission appointed by the British government to look into shortcomings in bus transport in Sri Lanka recommended replacing open body buses with closed body buses, which came to be known as 'Nelson body' buses. The limited liability omnibus companies that came into existence were the Silverline Bus Company owned by B. J. Fernando, the South Western Bus Company (Sir Cyril de Zoysa), the Ebert Silva Bus Company (Ebert Silva), Sri Lanka Omnibus Company (Jayasena Mudalali), Panadura Bus Company (Sir Leo Fernando), Wijaya Bus Company (Mudaliyar Mendis of Negombo), K. B. L. Perera and Sons of Hendala, Siri Medura Bus Company (Singho Mahattaya of Attanagalla) and so on. The owners were in overall charge of operations, and the companies ran the services on their own whims and fancies; the companies shared routes among themselves. It was therefore difficult for the commuters to travel to distant places without breaking journey at one or two destinations. There were no time schedules or night time services. Buses packed to capacity were driven at a terrific speed, even on bends on the steep roads of the Hatton-Adam's Peak route. Only the South Western Bus Company was run on modern lines. These companies employed the minimum number of staff: support staff was almost non-existent. The employees were treated abominably: one owner allegedly tied a bus conductor to a tree and spanked the poor man for failing to bring in the targeted collection for the day. Unionisation by N. M. Perera's All Ceylon United Motor Workers' Union had to proceed in secret, with union agents disguising themselves to avoid company thugs. At the time, all the buses ran on petrol (gasoline) or even kerosene (paraffin). Among the makes employed were Bedford, Chevrolet, Dodge, Ford, Leyland and Mercedes-Benz. Only the South Western Bus Company had run double-decker buses, which plied on the Galle Road.  Ceylon Transport Board  = Beginnings = An AEC Routemaster at Godagama junction in Homagama, Sri Lanka The Ratnam Survey in 1948, the Sansoni Survey in 1954 and the Jayaratna Perera Survey in 1956 studied the bus services in Sri Lanka and all recommended that the companies should be nationalised. In 1957, the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna government led by Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike decided on the nationalisation of bus services. In order to provide a better service to the people, he established the Ceylon Transport Board on 1 January 1958. The inaugural trip of the CTB took the Prime Minister and the Transport and Works Minister Maithripala Senanayake on a maroon luxury Mercedes-Benz bus imported from Germany. This bus is still owned by the Nittambuwa Bus Depot. The creation of a single nationalised entity made possible long distance operations and running buses on a large number of rural routes. To supplement the company buses that were vested in the CTB, a record number of buses and bus chassis were imported. Leyland, Wayne, Hino and Magirus Deutz buses and even a ≈†koda bus with a trailer were imported. Hundreds of ex-London Transport single-decker C & CR Leyland Cubs, TD Leyland Tigers, AEC Regal RFWs and all- diesel double-decker Guy Arab, Daimler, RT (AEC), and RTL & RTW (Leyland) buses arrived in the 1950s and 1960s from London Transport. Steps were taken to convert other buses to diesel fuel. The CTB was given a good start under the Chairmanship of Vere de Mel of the Ceylon Civil Service (and of Quickshaws, the private taxi company). Thereafter the services deteriorated and the Board ran into financial difficulties owing to mismanagement. In 1964 Anil Moonesinghe of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) became Minister of Communications, in overall charge of the transport, including the CTB. He took a very close interest in the running of the organisation. He introduced workers' councils on the Yugoslav model to participate in management, with a resultant improvement in morale and efficiency. He expanded the bus services, most notably in Jaffna, where the ex-London Transport double-deckers were very popular and broke the monopoly on public transport by illicit private operators. Moonesinghe took steps to set up a Central Bus Station (CBS) in the central Colombo district of Pettah, close to the main Fort Railway Station. He started the Central Workshops at Werahera, just outside Colombo, which built bus bodies out of aluminium and carried out engine repairs and overhauls. The fleet strength was continuously increased by the addition of more second-hand London buses. Fiat and OM Tigrotto buses were imported new. The Fiat company also gifted about 50 cars (in lieu of commission), which were used by the CTB's Flying Squad. He was in the middle of negotiating with the Fiat company to build buses in Sri Lanka when the government of which he was a minister fell in 1965. The incoming United National Party regime recruited a large number of political supporters as staff, so that the hitherto favourable employee/bus ratio increased and made the CTB a loss-making institution. The pending agreement with Fiat, which would have enabled Sri Lanka to export buses to China, was scrapped and a deal was made with British Leyland instead. The workers' councils were also scrapped. = Golden age = In 1970, the United Front government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike was returned to power, with Leslie Goonewardene of the LSSP as Minister of Transport. The CTB workers immediately took matters into their own hands and reconstituted the workers' councils. On their demand, Anil Moonesinghe (now no longer an MP) was brought back as Chairman and General Manager. Anil Moonesinghe would dress in a bush shirt and trousers and operate as a one-man flying squad to catch errant bus crews in the act, lying in wait in his metallic blue Volkswagen Variant or his Citro√´n 2CV at places like Dematagoda Junction to prowl on them. Stories would abound (all untrue) of him being spotted disguised with a beard. In order to prove that eight buses could be serviced in a day, he once carried out eight vehicle services at the Central Workshops, Werahera.  New management vision  Moonesinghe planned a multi-faceted approach to the management of the institution: training and skills enhancement, scientific methodology and discipline were considered to be three main requisite characteristics. The managerial competency and skill of the CTB staff was upgraded, and several batches of management trainees were recruited to all its major functional areas. A training arm was organised for both the managerial and the lower- level staff. Staff were recruited on projected future needs and not on an ad- hoc basis as hitherto. Operations were put on a scientific footing. Measurements were introduced to ascertain the efficiency of every sector. Operations were re-structured based on studying commuter demands, and operational bases were expanded by increasing the number of depots to over 100. Operational discipline was improved by displaying running and route numbers as well as destinations on buses and systematising terminal controls through efficient and effective time-keeping, to enhance the regularity in the operation of the running schedules. Way-side breakdowns were brought down to a bare minimum. The views of commuters were sought. J. Diandas, a well known commuter representative and rights activist (as well as a specialist in transport) was made an advisor, and consultations with consumer bodies were frequently carried out. Local Bus Body building This industry (Bus/Lorry Body building) reached its peak in the mid 1960s to the late 70s and gradually declined after 1977 when the open economic policy of the new government came into play,, Then in the mid 1980s the SLTB‚Äôs own local bus body building facilities abandoned and Indian imports in complete built form replaced the local manufacture,.  Technical improvements  A policy of standardisation was inaugurated, to prevent the multiplication of bus types and makes. Bus chassis were purchased from Ashok Leyland and Tata; Isuzu chassis were also obtained (at prices equivalent to the Indian chassis) in order to prevent cartelisation by the Indian suppliers. Some chassis were also imported from Ikarus of Hungary. As an emergency measure, several hundred BMC WF lorry chassis intended for goods transport were taken over by the CTB and converted into buses. Trans Board Tours, intended to hire buses for private trips, was started and a fleet of luxury Leyland Viking buses was acquired for it. These were very comfortable buses painted light brown. The double-decker buses imported second-hand from London Transport were gradually withdrawn from service due to the high cost of spare parts and heavy diesel consumption compared to the new Indian and Japanese buses. Only a few of these remain, notably one at Maharagama depot, which runs up to Avissawella. A positive effort was made to build up local industry, and the CTB became well equipped with foundries and workshops: the Central Workshop at Werahera became the largest in South Asia, equipped with machine tools from India, Germany and the Eastern Bloc. In 1974 the assembly of bus chassis and prototypes of a locally manufactured bus and a car rolled out of Werahera. Preference was given to locally manufactured spare parts, and the automotive spare parts industry grew rapidly. The requirement for skilled intermediate technical staff was also taken in hand. The Ceylon-German Training School, started with aid from the Federal Republic of Germany, became the Sri Lanka-German Technical Training Institute, producing high-grade technicians.  Self-management  The workers' councils were regularised as 'Employees' Councils', with regular elections supervised by the Elections Commissioner. Dudley Wijesiri, a brilliant young manager, was put in charge of the unit tasked with taking workers' self-management forward. Management was decentralised as much as possible to depot level, where management tasks were shared between the Depot Superintendent (a technical officer) and the Depot Employees' Council. At the same time, discipline was strictly enforced. The enthusiasm of the employees helped improve the efficiency of the mammoth institution. For example, they pointed out a number of ways by which bus conductors could cheat their ticket machines. A special ticket machine workshop was established at Ethul Kotte to incorporate the modifications suggested by them. A congress of all the Employees' Councils in the Board was held in 1975. Leslie Gunawardena and Anil Moonesinghe were preparing the next step up the workers' self-management ladder: the Board of Directors was to be reconstituted with half the members to be elected by the Employees' Councils, with the Chairman holding the balance.  Results  As a consequence of all these, the reliability of operations increased and the commuters could rely on (i) the time tables, (ii) the first and last trips on the routes schedules, (iii) courtesy and promptness of service (iv) cleanliness of buses and premises, (v) courtesy and disciplined conduct of the staff and, most importantly (vi) safe and accident- free operation. The CTB was now carrying about 4,000,000 passengers per day, with just 5,000 running buses. Therefore, standee buses were introduced, with a conductors at each of the front and rear doors to ensure that no revenue was lost. 'Ladies Only' trips were started to enable women commuters to return home after work. By 1974 the CTB was again running at a profit and proving a good service at the same time. Work was started on a new CBS in the Pettah, funded by monies generated by the CTB. This was to be a modern transport complex, complete with shops, a low-budget hotel for long-distance travellers and a cinema. Only one section of arc of the outer circular structure was completed by the end of 1975. Then, in September 1975, the United Front government broke up and Leslie Goonewardene and Anil Moonesinghe resigned. = Breakdown = Jack Kotelawela was now appointed Chairman. However, his management philosophy differed from that of Anil Moonesinghe. The Employees' Councils continued, but with none of the enthusiasm that characterised them in the earlier years. An adequate service was provided to the commuters, however. The change of government in 1977 saw the looting of CTB assets in broad daylight. Buses in running condition were condemned as unusable and sold to backers of the ruling United National Party at low prices. Some of them may still be seen on the roads, three decades later. The new government of J.R. Jayewardene was intent on destroying what was now a popular symbol of efficient state enterprise. By Law No. 19 of 1978, the CTB was broken up into Regional Transport Boards (RTBs). A central co-ordinating body, the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board (SLCTB) was established, but it was not organic with the RTBs. The partially constructed new CBS building, which had been built with funds generated by the CTB, was handed over to the Urban Development Authority. The Employees' Councils were scrapped. A series of inadequately thought out plans were put into operation, notably the 'Green Circle Line' - scrapped within five years. A large amount of money was spent repainting the buses green. Lumpenproletariat supporters of the UNP were recruited in large numbers to the RTBs, particularly after the 1980 General Strike. Jayewardene also re-introduced the system that had prevailed in the pre-bus company days, of unregulated private buses. The difference was that operators had to obtain route licences. The road discipline of these operators, many of whom had political backing, was almost non-existent, but commuters, faced with a state transport system now on the verge of collapse, had no option but to travel on them. Most of these private buses are in a pitiable condition today and many are unroadworthy. Jayawardene's successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, broke the RTBs down into smaller units based on 93 bus depots, the so-called 'Peoplised Bus Companies'. The Central Workshops, Werahera and the regional workshops established in the 1970s were handed out to private companies in controversial circumstances. In the 1990s, the lack of success of these enterprises drove the government to group the 93 'Peoplised Bus Companies' into 11 'cluster' companies. By the 2000s (decade), the 'peoplised' transport services accounted for less than a quarter of the daily load of bus passengers. Scarcely a day passed without a letter in the press complaining about overloading, excessive speeds, dangerous driving, rudeness and overcharging on the private buses. The cluster companies did not suffer as much bad publicity, as they endeavoured to observe regulatory requirements and offered a nationwide, if thinly spread service.  Sri Lanka Transport Board  After Dinesh Gunawardena was made Minister of Transport in 2001, he consulted Anil Moonesinghe (by them Sri Lanka's ambassador to Austria) and others on how the transport services were to be improved. This was followed up with a Bill to set up the CTB once again. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the bill, but the fall of the Government delayed the bill's presentation to Parliament. Finally, in early 2005, the institution was resurrected as the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). The move received bipartisan support in Parliament. It was hailed by the Joint Business Forum (J-Biz), which welcomed the revival of the CTB: this was one of the rare occasions on which the business community said a state bus service was better than privatised ventures. In July 2007, it was announced that steps had been taken to increase the SLTB bus fleet from 4,200 to 5,000 within the year, by importing engines to put sidelined buses into operation. At that time, the private bus fleet of Sri Lanka was 19,000 strong.

Much of the Latin American economy was dominated by World Bank and IMF forced policies during the debt crisis of the early 1980s. The late 1990s began a shift in political thought in the region moving towards support for more populist, left and centre-left governments, particularly by peasants. Mercosur, an economic agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay along with associate members Chile and Bolivia in 1994 want to improve development through protecting the free movement of goods between these countries. Such policies as establishing a common external tariff and a common trade policy promote an infant industry argument. The relaunching of Mercosur in the mid 2000s can be seen as a new form of regionalist governance in the Southern Cone. Canada has become at the centre of this conflict and has received much criticism by anti-imperialist struggles protesting for local control over privatized natural resources.  Foreign aid policy shift  Recently, with the Conservative government of Canada, a dramatic shift in foreign aid has occurred towards middle-income countries in Latin America, causing the abandonment of many projects in Africa. Once again, the Conservative government has come under scrutiny for its Foreign Aid Policy as the Canadian International Development Agency has established foreign-aid pilot projects in South America with large mining corporations, to foster economic growth and international trade in Canada. Since the Conservatives came to power in 2006, over $50 million in projects have been approved and many more are under way. NGOs and mining industry critics have been accusing the Conservative government for subsidizing phony \\"corporate social responsibility\\" projects that are led by profitable companies with bad intentions. Jamie Kneen of MiningWatch Canada said that \\"the government is helping the mining industry to put a positive spin on their operations, despite their negative environmental and human-rights records\\". In contrast, the president of the Canadian Mining Association Pierre Gratton believes \\"these projects help improve the image of the industry ‚Ä¶ because they are meaningful and have value. This is not just PR.\\"  Cultural, health and environmental concerns  The expansion of Canadian mining companies in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1990s was never paralleled with official Canadian legislation on standards abroad, which has caused much debate on socio-economic change and conflict to numerous rural and indigenous communities. Traditional production methods are often destroyed, and in regions such as Chile, areas with mining activities have the greatest unemployment and poverty rates in the country. Mining can have adverse effects on non-mineral production, such as agriculture when Canadian mining production leads to soil erosion, such as the case in La Libertad, Colombia. In addition, reports of the spills of harmful chemicals, such as cyanide in local water supplies has increased deaths of livestock and skin disorders and infection among children. Increased social disorganization with violent protests, criminal activities and even deaths and group rape have been suspected to be caused by the involvement of some Canadian mining companies. Increased assassinations of activists have shown the political conflicts and related corruption as divisions between anti and pro-mining groups escalate.  Canadian companies  = Ascendant Copper =  Involvement in Ecuador  * Protests over the Jun√≠n mining project = Barrick Gold = Toronto- based Barrick Gold Corp, the largest gold producer in the world, has been critiqued by NGOs such as the MiningWatch Canada, Greenpeace, and Amnesty International for their environmental degradation and economic and social impacts in Ancash, Condorhuain, Chilecito, Famatina, and Pascua-Lama.  Involvement in Argentina and Chile  (see Greenpeace Protests) Since Barrick Gold Corp acquired the Pascua Lama open-pit mine site in 1994 which crosses the borders of Argentina and Chile, environmental concerns such as water pollution and glacier relocation. Protesters carrying sign such as \\"Harper Go Home!\\" were displayed upon Prime Minister Stephen Harper's visit in July 2007 and show the growing negative opinion of Canadian relations by Latin Americans.

In a particular case the Maya-Mam in San Miguel Ixtahuac√°n have experienced an increase in violence, particularly during an event where the government unleashed security forces killing one man and seriously wounding 16 people. Environmental problems such as deforestation through the clear cutting of 20 square km of forest, the contamination of ground and surface water with the excessive use of cyanide and the extensive draining of water. The contamination of water with arsenic, magnesium, cyanide cooper and iron in San Marcos exceeds the already low regulations on water quality in Guatemala. Damage to the structure of homes is increasingly common due to dynamite explosions. Increased skin and respiratory diseases are also a major issue. The Guatemala government suspended operations of the Canadian Goldcorp's Marlin Mine after the demands of the 18 Maya Indigenous communities affected by the environmental degradation of land. Reports from the Latin American Water Tribunal, the International Labour Organization, the Physicians for Human Rights and the University of Michigan have all negative reports on the mining site, which have been dismissed by Goldcorp and the Canadian government.  Involvement in Honduras  Findings of dangerously high levels of heavy metal poisoning in the blood of children and adults according to World Health Organization and CDC standards in the Siria Valley due to open-pit, cyanide leaching. In 2008 Goldcorp halted operations at the San Martin mine. Canadian government and business such as Aura Minerals still cooperate with the Honduran regime with further investments in corrupt mining practices and low-paid sweatshop industry. Reports of death squad killings in Honduras due to mining activities in general have also occurred. = Greystar Resources =  Colombia  *Santander community protests and conflict = HudBay Minerals Inc. =  Involvement in Guatemala  Lawsuits against the company have been launched by a group of 11 women from Guatemala with allegations of gang-rape by security personnel, members of the police and military in 2007 after an attempt to clear people from lands near a mining project. In addition a lawsuit for the murder of a man by private security guards hired by HudBays Guatemalan subsidiary company in 2009 was also put forth in Ontario courts. The brutal murder of an indigenous rural worker and the resulting wounding of seven others by a subsidiary of HudBay Minerals Inc. occurred in 2009 after locals gathered to protest a forced eviction were reported by Amnesty International and other Human rights groups. = Manhattan Minerals Corp =  Peru  *Tambogrande community protests = Metallica Resources Inc =  Mexico  *community of Cerro de San Pedro protests = Skye Resources =  Guatemala  *Mayan K'iche' peasants protests = South American Silver Corporation = = Bolivia = On 11 July 2012, Bolivian president Evo Morales revoked SASC's mining permit by presidential decree.  Bill C-300  The Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act, also known as Bill C-300, was defeated in a vote of 140 to 134 in the House of Commons of Canada in October 2010. The Summary of the bill states: Mining companies were extremely opposed to the legislation and believed the bill would cost jobs. For example, a mining executive complained that the bill assumed \\"Canadian mining companies are bad corporate citizens\\". He insisted that this \\"could not be further from the truth\\". An article written by faculty of law professors from both the University of Toronto and Ottawa in the Canadian Globe and Mail argued if standards are being met then the extreme opposition towards Bill C-311 should not have occurred by mining companies.  Greenpeace protests  In March 2011, Greenpeace Argentina led a campaign against Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold in its attempts to block the application of a new law to protect glaciers passed by parliament in Argentina. The law prohibits any poor environmental standards which would damage and contaminate glaciers.  Accumulation by dispossession  David Harvey's idea of accumulation by dispossession is a framework used by some sociologists, economists and geographers to understand the activities of Canadian mining companies in Latin America. This idea views that western countries use neoliberal capitalist policies to ensure their wealth and influence by dispossessing the public of their wealth or land. This concept sees the constant need to pursue accumulation of wealth to ensure the current economic model as harmful to the environment and societies.

In 1863 they bought the 80 acre parcel that contains the cabin. They were probably the first settlers on the land, and put up the cabin quickly, flattening only one side of the logs to make a smooth inner wall, and joining the corners with simple square notches and wooden pegs.

Local buses are operated in most part by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) although there are some lines which are operated by private sector companies under contract to TMB. There are over 100 urban lines serving the city and most of them pass through two or more districts, covering relatively long distances within Barcelona. Because of this, some lines called Bus del Barri (meaning The Neighbourhood's Bus in Catalan) were created. These lines are operated by small buses and cover short-haul routes enabling access to various parts of the neighbourhood as the shopping area, health care services, education centers and other facilities. =Interurban buses= The interurban bus service links Barcelona with the other towns in the metropolitan area. See the timetables of the various buses by searching the AMB (√Ärea Metropolitana de Barcelona) website. =Nitbus= During the night, the company NitBus provides a night-time bus service in Barcelona and the first metropolitan ring with 17 lines. All of them, except the N0, go through Pla√ßa de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines.

Before 1536  A distinction must be made between the City of Groningen and the surrounding countryside, known as the Ommelanden. The city of Groningen had already gained its independence from its formal landlord, the Bishop of Utrecht in the 12th century. The Ommelanden, together with their Frisian neighbours, enjoyed the Frisian freedom and had never had a Lord. Therefore, before 1536, the concept of a Lord of Groningen had never existed.  Charles V  After the Habsburg victory in the Battle of Heiligerlee (1536) during the Guelders Wars, the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden came under the rule of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. They were joined together in the Lordship of Groningen and ruled by a Stadtholder, but with preservation of their ancient rights and privileges. Because of the predominant position of the city, the union was never very successful. In 1548 the Lordship of Groningen became part of the Burgundian Circle.  Dutch rebellion  When the Union of Utrecht was signed in 1579, the Lordship of Groningen also joined. But there was much more enthusiasm in the Ommelanden, who saw this as an opportunity to regain their independence from the city, than in Groningen itself. In March 1580, Stadtholder George van Lalaing succeeded in convincing the city of Groningen to leave the Union of Utrecht and to remain loyal to the King of Spain. The city now became a northern bastion for the Spanish in the Eighty Years' War, but they lost more and more territory until the city was taken in the during the siege in 1594. The lordship was abolished but the city and the Ommelanden remained united in one province. Groningen and the Ommelanden became part of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.

A Federal statutory body, it is one of the largest repositories of primary source documents in Germany and spans the history of Prussia, Brandenburg, the House of Hohenzollern and the Prussian Army. Insofar as the agency represents over 400 years of archival work of the former states of Brandenburg-Prussia, including their main roots in the Teutonic Knights, the Archives can be said to cover \\"nine centuries of European history between K√∂nigsberg and Cleves.\\" Building Berlin-Dahlem building in 2011 Originally located in the Berlin Palace, the Archive moved into a prestigious new building erected specifically for it in Berlin-Dahlem. It was built between 1914-1924 following a design by . The building was renovated and expanded in 1999. The address is Archivstra√üe 12-14, D - 14195 Berlin, Germany History The origins of the Archives can be directly traced back to 1282, when a collection of official papers under the auspices of the Margrave of Brandenburg was first documented. Formal organization of the stocks occurred in 1468, and in 1598 the Elector of Brandenburg appointed Erasmus Langenhain \\"Registratura Archivorum\\" to bring systematic order to the sovereign's documents, official records and files. Today's GStA PK traces itself back to this professional tradition. In the middle of the 17th century the holdings became a personal repository of the first King of Prussia under archivist and granted the honorific title \\"Privy State Archives\\". In 1803, the Archives were expanded with the addition of Prussian governmental, judicial and regional documents and renamed the \\"Prussian State Archives.\\" Until 1883, when Brandenburg, then the only Prussian province without an own provincial archive, founded the Brandenburgian Provincial Archive, the Privy State Archives also collected all the records from that territorial and political entity. By 1901, the institution had developed precise standards for the preservation of public records that have had a pronounced effect on the archival profession.Schellenberg, T.R. \\"The Appraisal of Modern Public Records: Evidential Values.\\" Bulletins of the National Archives, Number 8 October 1956 https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives- resources/appraisal-evidential-values.html During World War II, the majority of the holdings were evacuated to abandoned mines at Stassfurt and Sch√∂nebeck between 1943 and 1944 to protect them from Allied bombing. As the Soviet Army advanced on East Prussia, the K√∂nigsberg State Archives were evacuated to G√∂ttingen. After the war, holdings that wound up in the Soviet occupation zone were moved relatively unscathed to a newly created German Central Archive housed in Merseburg, East Germany. The original Dahlem headquarters building wound up in the US sector of Allied-occupied West Berlin. In 1946 it became the main archive for West Berlin's government and included partial stocks from the historic collection. In 1963, these came under the jurisdiction of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and the Archive was again named the \\"Privy State Archives\\". From 1978-1979 the K√∂nigsberg collection was relocated to Berlin. After German Reunification, from 1993 to 1994, the GDR Archives maintained in Merseburg were also brought back to Berlin and the historic record was again complete. Collection Approximately 35,000 linear meters of archives with a library service of some 185,000 volumes and 200 periodical subscriptions.

Life  Christoph was the third surviving son of Count Karl I of Hohenzollern (1516-1576) from his marriage to Anna (1512-1579), daughter of Ernst, Margrave of Baden-Durlach. Christoph studied law together with his brother Karl II (1547-1606) studied in Freiburg im Breisgau and Bourges. When Karl I died in 1576, the County of Hohenzollern was divided into Hohenzollern-Hechingen, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Hohenzollern-Haigerloch. Christoph, the youngest son, received the Lordship of Haigerloch, which had been acquired in 1497. It included Enisheim Castle and the towns of Imnau and Stetten. His eldest brother Eitel Friedrich IV received Hechingen, his other brother Karl II received Sigmaringen. Christoph's part had 10000 inhabitants at the time and was substantially smaller than the parts of his brothers. Christoph founded the elder Haigerloch line, which died out with his younger son. Christoph cared intensely about the administration of his country. He soon began an extensive reconstruction of his Haigerloch Castle; he felt that the medieval castle was not representative for a ruler of his era. However, he died before the work could be completed. Christoph and his wife together founded the Holy Trinity Church in Haigerloch. When Count Christoph Stanislaus of Nellenburg died in 1591, Christoph inherited the Lordship of Wehrstein with the castle of the same name and the village of Dettensee. Christoph inherited because Christoph Stanislaus's brother had been married to a countess of Hohenzollern. The other claimant was Anna Maria of Wolfentein, who had had a failed marriage with a citizen of Bregenz named Fezenn. Christoph and his brothers discredited her by claiming she had been a prostitute.  Marriage and issue  Christoph married Catherine (died after 1608), a daughter of Baron Christoph of Welsperg, in Sigmaringen in 1577. Christoph and Catherine had the following children: * Johann Christoph (1586-1620), Count of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch : married in 1608 to Countess Marie Elisabeth of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1592-1659) * Karl (1588-1634), Count of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch : married in 1618 to Countess Rosamunde of Ortenburg (d. 1636) * Gwendolyn Marie Salome (1578-1647), a nun in the Inzigkofen Abbey * Anna Dorothea (‚Ä† 1647), Prioress at Inzigkofen Abbey * Marie Sidonia, a nun at S√∂flingen Abbey * Jakobe (died after 1607)  References  * W√ºrttembergische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr vaterl√§ndische Geschichte, Geographie, Statistik und Topographie, Aue, 1837, p. 115 (Online) * Gustav Schilling: Geschichte des Hauses Hohenzollern, in genealogisch fortlaufenden Biographien aller seiner Regenten von den √§ltesten bis auf die neuesten Zeiten, nach Urkunden und andern authentischen Quellen, F.

Career Tinkebell's projects have English names, and are not translations from Dutch. She has been the target of significant amounts of hate mail, death threats and calls for criminal prosecution. In 2004, Tinkebell gained national notoriety in the Netherlands with a handbag she fabricated using the fur of her own house cat. She indicated she had killed the animal herself, by breaking its neck and skinning it. The goal of this work was to raise the question why it is accepted in society that production animals like cows and pigs are killed for consumption, but doing the same to pets is not. According to Tinkebell, the cat, aged two, was depressed to the point where it could no longer be left at home unattended.Pauw & Witteman, VARA, 14 mei 2009. She claimed the cat was actually very ill and would die of its disease.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlIV-utTMnY In June 2007, formal questions were raise in Dutch parliament by the Partij voor de Dieren because of a Tinkebell project. During an eco-design fair in Platform 21 in Amsterdam, she offered people to buy 60 male live chicks or otherwise dump the chicks into a shredder, to show how male chicks are treated in the bioindustry.SAVE THE MALES!, http://www.katinkasimonse.nl In early 2008, Tinkebell again became a topic of conversation due to the exposition Save the pets, in which she had 95 hamsters running around in hamster balls in art gallery Masters in Amsterdam. She wanted to show how people treat their pets. Again, her basic concept was the dual morality people maintain in respect of animals, because nobody will protest a single hamster in a ball, but people will protest 95 hamsters in 95 balls. Again she was interviewed in several newspapers and Dutch TV-shows. On 24 January 2008, the Dutch animal welfare authority confiscated the hamsters. The Partij voor de Dieren again raised questions in parliament. On 8 September 2009 and 6 May 2010, she was tried for the case in front of the police magistrate in Amsterdam. It was eventually referred to a Dutch court specifically for complex or serious cases. There she was tried on 7 January 2011.Boete ge√´ist tegen kunstenares Tinkebell om hamsters, nu.nl On 21 January 2011, the court declared the allegations not proven and acquitted miss Simonse.LJN: BP1587, Rechtbank Amsterdam , 13/442043-08, rechtspraak.nl, 21 januari 2011 Together with Dutch artists Jonas Staal and Daan Samson she is regarded as an exponent of a new category media artists.Kleijn, Koen (12 November 2012) 'De mediakunstenaar', De Groene Amsterdammer By taking up distinct positions in the media, social issues are being broached. Tinkebell's work resulted in a storm of publicity and criticism multiple times, including hate mail and death threats. Some of the hate mail and death threats (about 1% in total) were collected and bundled. In cooperation with Coralie Vogelaar, the people sending them were researched and both the hateful messages (according to the authors 'over a hundred thousand') and their profiles were published in the 2009 book Dearest Tinkebell. The published information includes personal information of the people, like name, address and social media profiles.

She was born in Napier, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand on 4 October 1896. She trained at Auckland public hospital. In 1922 she was accepted by the Anglican society for the Propagation of the Gospel for missionary work in China. Mission in China In 1923, she arrived in Beijing (at that time called 'Beiping'). For several years she worked at the Peking Union Medical College, which was a well-funded hospital operated by protestant missionaries. She went through several years of language training and eventually was put in charge of a hospital in Datong. In 1927, she was transferred to a hospital in Anguo, where she was placed in the hospital management. Anguo was the first western hospital in a rural part of northern China. She ran two classes for training nurses in Anguo and trained more than 60 nurses. She went to rural areas to set up clinics and help the local people. She set up western medical stations in many places that had never seen such things before. In 1934, she returned to New Zealand briefly to do some studies before returning again to China. In 1934, she went to Shijiazhuang to help poor Chinese living in terrible conditions with western medicine.http://nzchinasociety.org.nz/he-ming-qing- kathleen-hall-memorial-scholarship/ She used her own money and even wrote back to New Zealand to ask her family to send her money. Role in World War II Japanese soldiers began the war in July 1937 following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The first major battle in the war was fought in the area around Beijing (see Battle of Beiping‚ÄìTianjin). During this period, Kathleen tended to the medical needs of wounded Chinese. She also met Chinese general L√º Zhengcao who himself was wounded and tended by Kathleen at her hospital in Anguo.< She treated many wounded Chinese soldiers at her hospital in Anguo. She came to know of the Japanese atrocities in the war, like the taking of all the food and supplies from villages, then burning them down. During this time, according to local Chinese sources, she actively assisted the Chinese resistance against the Japanese invaders. She frequently used her identity as a missionary as a cover to purchase medical supplies that were used by Chinese that were resisting the Japanese invasion. She would purchase supplies in Beijing and then transfer them to rural areas in Hebei or Shanxi. She assisted Canadian doctor Norman Bethune, who was helping the Chinese communists in the Eighth Route Army, in this capacity, and formed a deep friendship with Dr. Bethune. Beijing was occupied by the Japanese at the start of the war, but it also had more ample medical resources within the city than rural areas on the outside. Every time that she would travel to Beijing, she would take a list given to her by Dr. Bethune of various medical items that the communist soldiers needed. She would purchase these items in Beijing nominally in the name of the missionary hospital in Anguo. She would make this trip more than 30 times in a year. A small network of Chinese resistors assisted her with this. A number of the people she trained at the missionary hospital in Anguo also went to join Dr. Bethune's medical team with the Eighth Army. She would sometimes sleep in churches and hide Chinese civilians or communist soldiers in the churches. A story from an eyewitness named Gao Jingyun, recorded in 1989, even claimed that she used the Xuanwumen church to meet people heading to Chinese communist territory and helped transport bomb material for them. > I still remember in July, one Sunday morning, Song brought someone, later I > learned that his name was Sun Lu, he was a student at Tsinghua university. > Afterwards we went with him on a bus to enter the city, he brought us to a > church.

Tian Guang Newspaper, March 15th 2017 article, ‚ÄòÁ∫™ÂøµÊäóÊó•Êàò‰∫âÂÖ®Èù¢ÁàÜÂèë‰∏ÉÂçÅÂë®Âπ¥‚Äô Friendship with Norman Bethune The war had begun in July 1937. Norman Bethune, a Canadian communist medical doctor, who had earlier volunteered with the Republican forces in the Spanish civil war, arrived in China in January 1938 to assist the Chinese communists. He did not speak Chinese and so he relied entirely upon interpreters to help him. It was in late 1938, that he first heard of Kathleen Hall and her work, and he wanted to meet with her. He invited her to visit the Eighth army, and after she came and saw the problems they had with a lack of supplies or personnel, she began to work with them to set up the underground supply route of medical supplies and people from Beijing to the Eighth army. One time she asked Dr. Bethune to come to Anguo to perform emergency surgery, and he took a bicycle and personally went there to do the surgery, for which she was very grateful. She told Dr. Bethune that at the start of the war the Anglican church had told them that they could not join either side, or else they would be excommunicated. Dr. Bethune, an atheist, told her about his experiences in Spain and tried to convince her. In Spain, the nationalists under Franco had been openly supported by the preaching of high ranking authorities in the Catholic church, despite their mass murders of civilians and rebellion against a lawful government. Kathleen decided to support the communists. The two of them were very close friends. Kathleen raised some goats and they would drink goat milk with each other, or coffee, and shared many similar ideas. When Bethune died, he left the last of his money to Kathleen Hall. Buying medicine in the war  \\"In the past several months, the main medical supplies have largely been reliant upon Ms. Hall's help, she has spent about 15000 Yuan on medicine. These medicines should be enough for the Eighth army to go through the winter\\" - Norman Bethune . Guo Qinglan, a nurse who worked in a hospital behind enemy lines wrote of her, \\"I think, only Kathleen Hall could have gotten me to the base...I was sitting with the patients in the first convoy, Kathleen Hall was wearing sunglasses, dressed up fully as a missionary, carefully and timely looking out for the things on the vehicle as well as our surroundings...the wooden and bamboo boxes were filled with medicines, underneath there was electric equipment and wireless radio, only on top it was covered with some tins of cookies\\" . She would usually dress in clothes that made her deliberately look like a foreigner and missionary, in order to avoid Japanese suspicion of her activities. She set up a string of underground stations for moving medical supplies to the Eighth army. She would move supplies from Beijing to Anguo, under the guise of using them at her hospital in Anguo and then move some of the supplies from Anguo to the resistance.  Turn to Communism The Anglican church was profoundly opposed to international communism and it had given her as well as other missionaries at the start of the war that they could not choose sides, or else they would be excommunicated. When she had first come to China, she had little knowledge of the communists and she had once claimed that Communists were trouble-makers. But over time, her views changed. She met communist commander Nie Rongzhen and afterwards she claimed, \\"Communists have a mind that is open like the sea, only the communists will be able to change the face of China, because they have strict discipline, and they give a positive and friendly hope to the people of raising their standard of living\\" . Deportation from China After the war had gone on for two years, and after less than a year since she first started helping Dr. Bethune, her activities raised the suspicions of the Japanese. The Japanese employed many collaborators among the Chinese and other occupied peoples, and they became aware of the true nature of what she was doing in China. They came and destroyed both her clinics as well as church. They issued a formal complaint to the British ambassador. Kathleen made a request to the Anglican communion to help her rebuild the church and clinics. Not realizing that she was the direct target of what the Japanese had done to her clinics, since the newspapers had not reported anything about it, she went to Beijing once more to buy medical supplies and once she was in the city, she was arrested by the Japanese. Japan was still at peace with the British empire at the time, so they opted to deport her rather than execute her. She was deported to Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong, she made the decision to resign from the Anglican missionaries and to join the Chinese Defense league, in order to prepare for a return to China. In October 1939, she and several others started a journey to go back to rejoin the communists in Shanxi, first travelling through Vietnam. When she reached Guiyang she heard of Dr. Bethune's death. She was greatly affected by this and mourned deeply. When she finally reached Shijiazhuang, her health deteriorated. The communists moved her to Xi'an and eventually she was sent back to New Zealand. Return to China She attempted to return to China in 1950, after the communist victory, but she was not allowed to enter the country at that time, due to a general ban on westerners and foreigners entering at the time of the Korean war. In 1960, she was allowed entry and made a friendship visit to Tian'anmen square in Beijing, where she met with Zhou Enlai and saw a statue of Norman Bethune, which she cried in front of. She took a handful of dirt from next to the statue in her hand- the dirt had been a mixture of dirt from China and dirt from Canada. Legacy She died in 1970. According to her wishes, her remains were returned to China. On his deathbed, Norman Bethune wrote of her: 'Please convey my sincere thanks to Kathleen Hall, for all of her help'. A book on her in Chinese was written by Ma Baoru, the former deputy director of tourism in Baoding city. She is remembered in China as a hero and there are some statues of her. She was commemorated by the Tian Guang newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beijing in 2017. She has a primary school named after her in Songjiazhuang. She has often been cited in the context of a friendship figure between New Zealand and China. A book in English on her life was written by Tom Newnham entitled 'Dr. Bethune's Angel: The Life of Kathleen Hall'.

For a time they ran a dairy farm at Pukepapa, near Waituhi. Career Halbert became a licensed interpreter in 1915. His strong command of the MƒÅori language combined with his knowledge of MƒÅori literature gained him important roles such as assisting the New Zealand Geographic Board with MƒÅori place names, and revising the sixth edition of H. W. Williams's MƒÅori dictionary. Later he acted as an adviser on MƒÅori texts for the Polynesian Society. Halbert was a founding member of the Gisborne Art Gallery and Museum in 1955, and the first chairman of the Maori Museum Committee, advising on the MƒÅori collections. As a historian and genealogist, Halbert contributed to John Hikawera Mitchell's Takitimu (1944), a record of the migration of the Ngati Kahungunu. He also contributed to the Whakatane and District Historical Society's first memoir, Te Tini o Toi, as well as papers on the dating of Maori genealogies. From 1940 onwards Halbert devoted most of his time to studying the history and genealogy of the East Coast iwi. In 1999 his book Horouta: The History of the Horouta Canoe, Gisborne and East Coast was posthumously published by Reed Publishing. Poor health forced Halbert's retirement from the Maori Purposes Fund Board in 1968. He died at Lavington Private Hospital in Epsom, Auckland on 11 April 1973 and was buried at Taruheru Cemetery in Gisborne. He was survived by three daughters and three sons. At the time of his death, Halbert was preparing a major historical and genealogical work. He left three main collections of papers: a manuscript called 'Horouta', 130 complete whakapapa charts, and a series of maps and historical data with iwi and hap≈´.

Prelude Most of the Lords and ministers of the south west of Scotland had not supported The Engagement of 1647 between a faction of the Covenanters and King Charles I, but after the defeat of those Covenanters opposed to the Engagement (known as the Kirk party) at the battle of Mauchline Muir by those in favour (who became known as the Engagers), the Engagers sent an army into England to support the English Royalists in the Second English Civil War. The Engager's army was defeated at the Battle of Preston in August 1648. The credibility of the Engagers was undermined by their armies defeat at the battle of Preston, and members of the Kirk party in the south west organised the Whiggamore Raid that resulted in the overthrow of the Engagers party after a short civil war. After the execution of Charles I, the kaleidoscope of Scottish parties rearranged themselves, as some of those who had opposed Charles I came around to the view that they should accept his son, Charles II, as King of Scotland if he agreed to sign the Covenant. After Charles landed in Scotland it became clear that the English would invade Scotland to prevent Charles establishing himself in Scotland, because they feared that he would use Scotland as a base for further operations against the English Commonwealth. Foundation and operations The Kirk party created the Western Association in 1648, modelling it on the English Parliament associations (such as the Eastern Association). It was moribund until 1650 when an invasion from England became likely. On 5 September 1650, the committee of estates commissioned Archibald Strachan, Gilbert Ker and Robert Hackett to take their regiments of horse (cavalry) to the south-west, to take command of the Western Association and to raise new levies. In the early years of the English Civil War Strachan had fought for the English Parliamentary army against the English Royalists. He had commanded the army which defeated Royalist Marquess of Montrose at the Battle of Carbisdale 27 April 1650 and while serving under Leslie after April and before taking up his new command had made it plain that he did not support the Scottish Royalist cause. Strachan took a more extreme position than those who supported the Western Remonstrance drawn up at Dumfries on 17 October against fighting for Charles II unless he abandoned those excluded from public office and the army by the Act of Classes (1649). Strachan and two of his officers, Major William Govan and Scoutmaster Dundas, had sent a set of queries to Cromwell and other officers, to which the latter replied. cites: Carlyle, Letter 151. So Strachan refused to sign the Remonstrance on the grounds that if the Scots were to reject Charles II as king of Scotland (rather than just banning his supporters from public office and the army), then the English New Model Army would have no reason to continue the campaign and would leave return to south of the border. Strachan was dismissed from his command, and Govan and Dundas were cashiered. Strachan at first refused to relinquish his command and when he did, he remained close to his regiment while Gilbert Ker was placed in command of the army.\\"Boillie seems to hint, that Ker was not altogether hearty in the cause (Journal, vol. ii. p. 364.),‚Äîbut unfortunate officers seldom escape suspicion\\" . Oliver Cromwell was now in the fortunate position of having two Scottish armies opposing him with allegiances to two different political parties, the Resolutioners who supported King Charles II and the Protesters or Remonstraters who opposed the King. So Cromwell resolved to confine his attentions to the operations of the Western Association army to destroy it and then with his flanks secured march north with the whole of his force, and attacking the Resolutioners army. cites: Balfour vol. iv pp. 193‚Äì196 As the castle of Edinburgh was still in the hands of the Covenanters, Cromwell could only spare a force of about seven thousand horse, which he accordingly sent west about the end of November, under the command of John Lambert, to watch Ker's motions. Intelligence of this movement was received by the Scottish Parliament then sitting at Perth, on 13 November, in consequence of which Colonel Robert Montgomery was despatched with three regiments to support the Western Association army, the command of which he was requested by the parliament to take; and, to enforce this order, the committee on military affairs was directed to send a deputation to the Western Association to intimate to them the command of the parliament. Before Montgomery arrived, Ker, decided to attack the John Lambert's English Parliamentary force at Hamilton. Lambert's force was considerably superior in strength to Ker's, and were upon the alert, and when the Scots charged their quarters on the 1 December, at four o'clock in the morning. After a short skirmish, Ker's forces were dispersed, and he was wounded and taken prisoner. The next day (2 December) the remnants of the Western Association in the Kyle district met 200‚Äì300 survivors of the army in the Kyle district of Ayrshire chose to disband rather than follow Strachan, Dundas and thirty of their collogues, who left to join the English Parliamentary army.Govan had been readmitted into the army by Ker to take part in the battle and had been captured during it ( and ). With the defeat and Hamilton and the loss of their two most prominent commanders the Western Association ceased to exist as an effective fighting force. Thus removing the threat to Cromwell's flank that had been posed by a force that had consisted of between 5,000 and 6,000 horse. This secured Cromwell position in the south of Scotland. The English were now in possession of the whole of Scotland, south of the Clyde and the Forth, with the exception of Stirling, and a small tract around it; and as the castle of Edinburgh surrendered on 24 December, Stirling castle was the only fortress of any note, south of the Forth, which remained in the possession of the Resolutioners at the close of the year.

On 5 February 2012 Noble Energy reported that the Ensco 5006 drilling rig (formerly the Pride North America) had struck gas at a depth of 5,500 m. Preliminary estimates put the potential for natural gas at Tanin at 1.2-1.3 trillion cubic feet. A subsequent report evaluated the field as containing 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas: 0.6 TCF proven (contingent) reserves and 0.5 TCF prospective. Tanin is located within the Alon A license, in which three companies are partners: Noble Energy (47%), Delek Drilling (26.5%), and Avner Oil Exploration (26.5%). It is Israel's third-largest natural gas reservoir. Due to Noble Energy and Delek (and its subsidiary Avner‚Äôs) monopolistic position in the domestic natural gas production market, they were forced by the Israeli government to divest most of their rights in the Tanin and nearby Karish fields in 2016. The rights were acquired by the Greek exploration company Energean Oil & Gas.https://www.energean.com/operations/israel/tanin/ As of 2018, Energean has signed supply contracts with customers in Israel which account for all of the proven reserves in the two fields (at a production rate of 4.2 BCM per year).

Gas production from Tanin is expected after the Karish field goes online in 2022 and will be carried out using an FPSO vessel connected by a submarine pipeline to the Israeli domestic natural gas distribution grid.

The MCPNG‚Äôs purpose is to provide innovative solutions to strengthening the media in PNG. It is also responsible for enhancing the capacity of the media, and acting as a ‚Äúwatch-dog, agenda- setter and gate-keeper‚Äù. The MCPNG hopes to create a ‚Äúfree, pluralistic and vibrant media‚Äù that contributes to the democratic governance debate in the country. Programmes The MCPNG advances its goals through two programmes ‚Äì the Media for Development Initiative (MDI) and the Development Communication Initiative (DCI). The MDI is focused on the advancement of media in PNG and the DCI is responsible for engaging civil society in the communication of development information across the country. AusAID reports that the MDI contributed ‚Äúto improved stability, governance and service provision by supporting an open and democratic media that delivers quality information services to all areas of PNG.‚Äù Working with the National Broadcasting Corporation and the Media Council, the MDI strengthens the capacity and the operations of the media in PNG, particularly in the rural areas. This approach is based on the principle that an accessible and effective media can: * Increase the voices of the poor and marginalised in public policy * Support civic education, peace-building and promotion of culture * Foster civil society networks * Provide access to development information and complement basic services delivery, for example through agricultural extension radio programs and broadcasts on the availability of health clinics. The MDI is run by Justin Kili, a veteran journalist who has spent time working for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He is known as ‚Äúthe voice of PNG‚Äù. Initiatives In a presentation to the OECD, the Media Council listed several initiatives that it has led in line with its goals. They are: * A radio and newspaper campaign started to fight corruption that developed into a pledge from all local media houses to donate A$150,000 to promote governance, transparency and decency; * A campaign during the 2002 national elections that encouraged voters to vote for good leadership, change and ousting corruption; * The establishment of an independent media standard committee; * Establishment of an editor‚Äôs task force on corruption; and * Sections in print and electronic media on promoting good governance. Supporters The MCPNG lists its main supporters as AusAID and the embassy of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. AusAID contributes up to A$500 million to the programme per year. Between 2003 and 2008, AusAID contributed A$13.9 million specifically to the MDI. Misallocation of funds In June 2011, AusAID suspended its donations to the MCPNG after a routine audit found anecdotal evidence of fraud. The audit found that funds ‚Äúhad not been managed in accordance with procurement guidelines‚Äù and that several thousand dollars were missing. An executive director of MCPNG, Nimo Kama, was suspended following the revelation. Kama was formerly the MCPNG‚Äôs chief executive before being appointed as vice president of the Pacific Islands News Association (PINA), a body providing representation to media professionals across 23 Pacific Islands. Kama replaced the former vice president, John Woods, who resigned over disagreements with the PINA board‚Äôs stance on the constitutional crisis in Fiji.

The building was originally a private country house. After it closed as a hospital in 2004, proposals were brought forward for redevelopment of the site. History =Private house= Right of way through Standish Woods, located above Standish Park and Standish House Below Standish Wood, which together with Haresfield Beacon was acquired by the National Trust in 1931, lies Standish Park, which has existed since the 16th century. Originally part of Standish Court, the Park covered , and was part of the estate of the Baron's Sherborne of Gloucestershire. Developing the Park as a country retreat, Standish House was constructed on the property. In 1853, James Dutton, 3rd Baron Sherborne leased it to Gloucester-based businessman Richard Potter, son of Radical MP Richard Potter, then a director of timber merchants Price & Co., later the managing director of the Great Western Railway. Potter lived at the house with his wife Lawrencina, daughter of a Liverpool-based merchant, and their nine daughters. Three were born in the property, including later sociologist, economist, socialist and social reformer Martha Beatrice Webb, Lady Passfield. Potter developed the gardens along with managed Victorian era principles, building extensive heated greenhouses to allow the family to eat well. It eventually provided a ready supply of grapes, plus a dedicated mushroom house and watercress beds. A drilled spring provided a steady year-round stream, which was landscaped to provide a pond by the construction of a brick wall dam. Beneath the dam there was an ice store, allowing year-round supplies of ice. Standish Lodge, which marks the entrance of Standish Park and Standish House In 1882, Lawrencina died and the remaining family members moved out, with Richard moving to Box House in Minchinhampton, where he died on 1 January 1892. On 24 June 1884, Mrs. Annie Poole King of Kensington House, Brislington, Somerset leased Standish House on a contract term of 21 years from Edward Dutton, 4th Baron Sherborne, at a rate of ¬£150pa. The widow of a shipping magnate, she moved in with five children, plus a house staff of a coachman, cook, housekeeper, and gardener. A member of the Berkeley Hunt, at the time the house had a stable block capable of housing 30+ horses. The outbreak of the Boer War reduced global shipping rates, and particularly the rand, which greatly affected Mrs. King's income. In 1897 the family left the house, and downsized with their entire staff to Newark Park at Ozleworth, Wotton-under-Edge. =Hospital= In 1914 the house was unoccupied and Lord Sherborne, after having been approached by Mary King, not only lent it for use as a Red Cross Hospital but also agreed to have the whole inside painted. It was fitted with electric light and the baths and sanitary accommodation was improved. Standish House Hospital opened as a British Red Cross hospital under the management of Mary King on 13 May 1915. There were 100 beds within the house and 8 fully trained nursing sisters. The rest of the staff was all local volunteers. Patients were wounded soldiers from all over the country. A total of 2,292 sick and wounded soldiers were treated at the hospital during the First World War.Atkinson, p. 64. After the war living conditions were very poor which led to a rise in diseases such as tuberculosis. The Government and Local Authorities had a duty to try to improve people's health and so it was proposed that Standish should be opened as a Tuberculosis Institution.Atkinson, p. 65. Gloucestershire County Council bought Standish Park in its entirety from Lord Sherborne. The house was turned into a sanatorium to treat tuberculosis in 1922. Funds were raised for suitable equipment and refurbishing, the Red Cross contributing ¬£10,000.Atkinson, p. 69. Standish House Sanatorium was opened on 6 July 1922. It had a total of 140 beds divided into men's, women's and children's blocks. The wards were run to a strict timetable but there were also plenty of recreation activities including a jazz band, cinema, games, and concerts. Over the next 15 years, the accommodation was expanded and in 1939 a new men's block was opened. During the Second World War expansion slowed but, despite this, in 1947, \\"C\\" block, with 65 female beds, 19 children's beds and a modern Physiotherapy Department was opened.Atkinson, p. 104. In 1948 the hospital became part of the National Health Service and a new X-Ray Department was opened. As tuberculosis became less common the range of conditions treated at the hospital grew. It specialized in orthopaedics, rheumatology and respiratory care across the whole of Gloucestershire. In this role, it undertook joint replacements, as well as caring for coal miners from the Forest of Dean with the most serious of respiratory problems. In 1953 the name was changed to Standish House Chest Hospital.Atkinson, p. 116. In 1956 the League of Friends for Standish Hospital was formed which organized fundraising and additional amenities for patients and visitors. The hospital continued to develop its service including Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy. In 1974 the NHS had a major reorganization. Standish came under the Gloucestershire Area Health Authority. A new theatre was opened and the X-Ray Dept modernized. During the 1980s more management changes were made and services began to be transferred to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. Despite new facilities having been built, and protests made by local groups such as \\"Save Our Standish\\", in 1992 formal proposals were made to close the hospital.Atkinson, p. 181. Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust considered reducing the number of beds at the hospital, as part of a series of cost-cutting proposals, in October 2003. Although the Minister for Health, John Hutton, considered several options for the future of the hospital in March 2004, closure was ultimately confirmed and the last patients were ultimately moved to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in December 2004. =Redevelopment= In 2006 Standish Mutual Care Trust proposed turning the residual site into a centre for health and well being, but were out-bid by a private healthcare concern. Then in 2010 Gloucestershire County Council proposed a mixed-use redevelopment of the site involving a health and social care centre. The proposed \\"health campus\\" would offer supported living options and access to care for the elderly and people with physical and learning disabilities. However, in 2017 PJ Livesey Group, a private developer, proposed redeveloping the site for residential use. References Sources * Atkinson, Gillian (2004).

It was jointly developed in the United States and the United Kingdom in the early 2000s and by 2010 some 145 Escapades and its \\"bush plane\\" variant, the Highlander, had been built and many more kits sold. Design and development The Escapade design can be traced back to that of the Avid Flyer, via the Denney Kitfox and Reality Easy Raider, marrying the Easy Raider's wing to a stretched Kitfox Lite fuselage. The key differences between the two types are the Escapade's side-by-side seating in a widened cabin, dual controls, and the option of a tricycle undercarriage It was developed jointly in the United States and United Kingdom by Just Aircraft and Reality Aircraft respectively, the American prototype flying in February 2003, four months before its British counterpart. These prototypes differed to fit into local classifications. The Escapade has a Chromoloy steel frame and is largely fabric covered. The wings have constant chord, ending in Hoerner-type wingtips; the trailing edges are aluminum. The ailerons and flaps have glass fiber leading edges. The wings are braced to the lower fuselage longerons with V-form struts and vertical jury struts. The fuselage is polygonal in section, sloping inwards above and below the center line, with a flat aluminum upper surface that slopes upwards from the tail to the wing trailing edge, at the rear of the cabin. The empennage is conventional, the low aspect ratio tailplane with its swept leading edge and rounded elevators located at the top of the fuselage. There is a portside flight-adjustable elevator trim tab with optional electric drive. The unbalanced rudder extends to the keel, moving in a V-shaped gap between the elevators. The seating is under the leading edge of the wing with a cabin roof window in the wing center section. Access is through side transparencies. Engine options include several Rotax or Jabiru units in the 37-89 kW (50-120 hp) range, driving two- or three-blade propellers and enclosed in a cowling manufactured from composite materials. Both undercarriage versions have the main wheels on faired-in V-form struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons, with rubber-sprung half axles fixed to a compression frame. The conventional tailwheel is steerable but the alternative nose wheel castors freely, though a steerable version is planned. The Highlander version, intended for rough airstrips and marketed only in the United States, is designed to fly slowly and has a more robust undercarriage. Its wing has a 3 ft (910 mm) greater span, with vortex generators over the whole upper leading edge, and the fin is square cornered and 8 in (200 mm) taller. Its tail control surfaces are horn balanced and increased in area. The Highlander always has the conventional undercarriage, strengthened, with tundra tires and enhanced brakes. A 99 hp (74 kW) Rotax 912 ULS engine is fitted and allows a maximum takeoff weight of 1,320 lbs (598 kg). The Jabiru-engined United Kingdom prototype Escapade gained its permit to fly in September 2003 and the SLA prototype received British Civil Aircraft Rules section S approval from the Light Aircraft Association in April 2008. The Highlander was introduced in 2004. Operational history The Escapade made its first public appearance in the United States at the Sun 'n Fun airshow at Lakeland, Florida in April 2003 and in the United Kingdom at the Popular Flying Association International Rally at Kemble in July. The type was Grand Champion lightplane at the following year's Sun 'n Fun. By mid-2010 some 230 kits had been produced, with more than 65 Escapades and 80 Highlanders built and flown. In early 2012 there were 34 Escapades on the United Kingdom register. One ex-United Kingdom aircraft had by 2010 moved to the Irish Republic register. As of January 2019 there are four Highlanders registered in New Zealand.

He was born in the 4th century and lived until his death in the Byzantine Empire. Forced by Julian the Apostate to serve as a warrior against Christianity, he was imprisoned after being caught helping people in need or defending Christians, and awaited there his death penalty. However, John the Warrior was released after the death of the emperor during a war. The Warrior is always depicted as having dark hair and a beard, as well as wearing a weskit, trousers, boots, scale armour and a cape. Three symbols characterizes him; cross, spear and shield. Biography During the reign of Roman emperor Julian the Apostate in the last era of persecution towards Christians, John the Warrior served as a soldier in the army, and was forced by Julian to participate on Christian persecutions. However, as a Christian he warned other against attacks or possible imprisonments, and he sometimes visited prisoners. John was not only good towards Christians, but also towards the poor and people in need. He visited invalids and comforted the suffering. When Julian saw John supporting the Christians, he imprisoned him, where the warrior awaited his death penalty. However, in 363 AD Julian died during the Battle of Samarra, and subsequently John was released from the prison. The exact date of death is unknown, but it is known that he died of very old age. According to a legend, he ordered the place of his funeral and subsequently a devout woman appeared. His relics were preserved in a church in Constantinople dedicated to John the Apostle. It is believed that his relics perform miracles. Believers ask the Saint for intercession and solace for casualties and bereaved people. Veneration In the Russian Orthodox tradition, John the Warrior is regarded a helper in sorrow and poverty. Veneration was more common in Little Russia. According to Legends of the Saints (–°–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –æ —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö), the saint was required to pray a special prayer to reobtain stolen things and escaped servants. In the prologs about the Warrior it is said that he \\"better prevents servants from fleeing, warns about theft and makes evident revelation\\". There is an icon in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev depicting John the Warrior with prayers and kontaktions to the saint. The first verses are, > \\"–û –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –∑–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–∏—á–µ –∏ —É–≥–æ–¥–Ω–∏—á–µ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ –ò–æ–∞–Ω–Ω–µ –í–æ–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—á–µ! –ü–æ–º–∏–ª—É–π —Ä–∞–±–∞ > —Ç–≤–æ–µ–≥–æ, —Å—É—â–∞–≥–æ –≤ –±–µ–¥–∞—Ö, –∏ —Å–∫–æ—Ä–±–µ—Ö, –∏ –≤–æ –≤—Å—è–∫–æ–π –∑–ª–æ–π –Ω–∞–ø–∞—Å—Ç–∏, –∏ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏ –æ—Ç > –≤—Å—è–∫–∞–≥–æ –∑–ª–∞, –∑–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏ –æ—Ç –æ–±–∏–¥—è—â–∞–≥–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞. –¢–µ–±–µ –±–æ –¥–∞–Ω–∞ –±—ã—Å—Ç—å —Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞—è > –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ç—å –æ—Ç –ë–æ–≥–∞\\". > \\"O mighty intercessor and saint of Christ, John the Warrior!

O miracle-worker John, thou hast been shown to be a truly faithful servant and soldier of God, the all-good Sovereign; for, having suffered, in manly fashion, for the Faith and finished thy course in benediction, in the heavens thou dost behold the Lord and Creator of all most splendidly, and helpest men who suffer amid all manner of trials. Thou dost strengthen soldiers in battle, rescuing them from capture by the enemy, from wounds, sudden death and cruel misfortunes. Wherefore, entreat Christ the Master, O ever-memorable one, that He deal mercifully with us in every circumstance, that He lead us not into temptations, but save our souls, for He is a lover of mankind. Source: Iconography thumb John the Warrior is usually depicted with an uncovered head. His face is framed by dark hair and a beard. He wears an weskit, trousers, boots, scale armour (suggesting he was a horseman) and a cape. The three major attributes of John the Warrior are the cross (symbolizes his faith; defended by all available means), spear (strength; given by God in the name of the war against sin and unfaith) and shield (God's protection from all misfortunes). The feast day is on 30 July (Julian calendar), or 12 August (Gregorian calendar).

The core mandate of the Authority is to ensure maximum compliance with relevant laws in order to ensure a sustainable revenue stream for government as well as the controlled and safe flow of goods across the county‚Äôs borders. As part of efforts to improve compliance, the Authority is required to assist taxpayers to understand and meet their tax obligations by providing robust and comprehensive advice. Since its inception the GRA has integrated the three revenue institutions namely the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Value Added Tax Service (VATS) and the Revenue Agencies Governing Board (RAGB). History In December 2009, the three revenue agencies that is CEPS, IRS, VAT Service and RAGB Secretariat were merged in accordance with the Ghana Revenue Authority Act, 2009 (Act 791). GRA thus replaces the revenue agencies in the administration of taxes and customs duties in the country. GRA has been established to amongst others integrate the management of domestic tax and customs duties as well as modernise domestic tax and customs operations through the review of processes and procedures in revenue administration with information communication technology as the backbone. The establishment of the GRA is part of the reforms in revenue administration of tax collection in Ghana which began in the mid-eighties when CEPS and IRS were taken out of the Civil Service and made semi- autonomous and self-accounting public sector institutions with separate boards. The National Revenue Secretariat (NRS) was set up to formulate revenue policies, manage tax reforms and supervise the activities of CEPS and IRS.http://ir.knust.edu.gh/bitstream/123456789/9174/1/Kwame%20Asamoah%20Mensah.pdf In 1998, the VAT Service was established to administer VAT and other consumption taxes. RAGB also began operations in 2001 to supervise and monitor the operations of the revenue agencies.http://ir.knust.edu.gh/bitstream/123456789/4459/1/Tetteh%20Emmanuel%20Gidisu.pdf In 2002, the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) was introduced to enhance information interchange and risk profiling. Then in 2004, the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) was set up to operate on functional lines as a pilot programme for the future integration of tax administration in Ghana as well as to serve the needs of large taxpayers as a one-stop-shop operation. It was envisaged that the integration of the revenue agencies will bring the following benefits to taxpayers and the revenue administration. * Reduced administrative and tax compliance cost * Better service delivery * Improved departmental information flow. * Holistic approach to domestic tax and customs administration * Enhanced revenue mobilisation Organizational structure A nine-member governing Board of Directors, consisting of both public and private sector experts, makes policy decisions to be implemented by GRA Management. The Board also makes recommendations to the Minister of Finance on tax policy, reforms and legislations. The Chairman of the Board as well as the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority called the Commissioner-General are appointed by the President of the Republic of Ghana. The Authority has three main divisions, namely Customs Division (CD) Domestic Tax Revenue Division (DTRD) and Support Services Division (SSD) which are all headed by Commissioners. Functions Ghana Revenue Authority has been charged to perform amongst others, the following functions as enacted by Act 791: * Assess and collect taxes, interest and penalties on taxes due to the state with optimum efficiency; * Pay the amounts collected into the Consolidated Fund * Promote tax compliance and tax education; * Combat tax fraud and evasion and co-operate to that effect with other competent law enforcement agencies and revenue agencies in other countries; * Advise District Assemblies on the assessment and collection of their revenue; * Prepare and publish reports and statistics related to its revenue collection;https://gra.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gra_act.pdf * Make recommendations to the Minister on revenue collection policy Tax policy environment Tax revenue generation is based on clearly defined tax policy measures. GRA remains a key partner of the Tax Policy Unit of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (Ghana). This collaboration which is complemented by tapping the expertise of stakeholders drawn across several economic and social sectors is geared toward formulation of effective and sustainable policies designed to enhance tax revenue collection by the Authority. Taxpayers Taxpayers registered with GRA are segmented into three identifiable groups that is Large, Medium and Small based on defined criteria. Taxpayers with an annual turnover of over GH¬¢5 million are classified as large taxpayers. This category also includes specialist industries irrespective of their turnover. These are upstream and midstream petroleum companies, banking institutions, insurance companies, mining companies and quarries, and members of groups of companies where at least one member qualifies as a large taxpayer. Taxpayers within the turnover bracket of GH¬¢90,000 up to GH¬¢5million are categorized as medium taxpayers while those with an annual turnover of less than GH¬¢90,000 are classified as small taxpayers.  Introduction of Uni-Pass clearance system  On 21 February 2020,personnel and logistics were distributed by the Customs Division, to test the Uni-Pass clearance system at the Takoradi Port. This system handles all paperwork and payments at one point, an improvement on the previous system, which processed all the operations in several offices. This was after its successful implementation at the Aflao Collection Point in the Volta region.

One species is known, C. claviger from the Jurassic of southern Germany. Taxonomy Fossils of Cancrinos are rare, and their state of preservation is often imperfect. Count Georg zu M√ºnster first described Cancrinos in 1839, based on material from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen limestones of southern Germany. He described two species, Cancrinos claviger and C. latipes, differentiated by the size of the second antennae, but the two are now considered to be synonyms. Further specimens have been discovered in Upper Cretaceous lithographic limestones of Lebanon, and described as a new species, C. libanensis; however, Haug et al. (2016) made it the type species of a separate genus Paracancrinos. Classification Although M√ºnster was unable to discern any living relatives of Cancrinos during his original description, Reinhard F√∂rster proposed in 1984 that Cancrinos was a transitional form between spiny lobsters (Palinuridae) and slipper lobsters (Scyllaridae). Description Cancrinos differs most markedly from other related animals by the form of the second antennae, which are flattened towards the end, approaching the state seen in living slipper lobsters. Unlike living slipper lobsters, however, the flattened, distal parts of the antennae retain the ancestral state of comprising many segments, rather than being reduced to a single element. =Development= Because immature specimens have been found, parts of the ontogeny of Cancrinos are known, although it is unclear whether the smallest specimens are in the puerulus stage, or are juveniles. Younger specimens have less flattened antennae, more like those of living spiny lobsters; thus, Canrcinos exhibits a form of heterochrony known as peramorphosis. This ontogeny is thought to reflect the phylogeny of Cancrinos, representing a partial development from the ancestral spiny lobster-like form towards the derived slipper lobster-like form.

Midkiff Seductive (born 1917), a Cocker Spaniel, was the Best in Show at the 1921 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the first occasion it was awarded to a member of that breed. The judging in the Best in Show round had a split decision by the two judges, and required the referee to make a deciding vote. Early life Midkiff Seductive was a black and white Cocker Spaniel bred and owned by William T. Payne. Show career At the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1921, Seductive won the Best of Breed for Cocker Spaniels, and went on to win Mortimer Memorial Trophy for best American bred dog. Having reached the Best in Show round, she faced off against the Best of Breed of 20 other dog breeds. The other dogs in the final round included the Bull Terrier Ch. Haymarket Faultless, the Best in Show champion from the 1918 show. The final decision by judges Charles Hopton and Norman K. Swine was split, after two and a half hours of judging in the final round, the field was narrowed down to Seductive, the Pekingese Phantom of Ashcroft, the Boston Terrier Buddie Blink and an Airedale Terrier. This was then cut to leave only Seductive and Phantom left, and after further consideration between the two judges, a decision could not be reached. The referee, Dr. De Mund, was then invited to make a deciding decision. After sending the dogs around the ring a final time, he chose Midkiff Seductive, the crowd signaling their approval for the more popular choice. De Mund said of his choice, \\"They were two splendid dogs. I gave the Cocker the prize over the Pekingese Phantom of Ashcroft because I consider that she is a better Cocker Spaniel than the Pekingese is a Pekingese.\\" Her victory at Westminster made her the first Cocker Spaniel to win the title of Best in Show. At the show of the Ladies' Kennel Association of America in Mineola, New York, Seductive won the Best of Breed title but was beaten for Best in Show by the Airedale Terrier Ch. Polam Maxim. She was not entered in the 1922 Westminster show. Later life Seductive was bred with Ch. Robinhurst Foreglow, and produced Ch. Midkiff Miracle Man who went on to win Best in Show at the American Spaniel Club's annual show in 1925 and 1926. Her trophy for Best Cocker Spaniel owned by a member of the American Spaniel Club which she won at Westminster in 1921 is now on display at the American Kennel Club Library in New York.

Acute or chronic disruption and/or attenuation of the ulnar collateral ligament often result in medial elbow pain, valgus instability, neurologic deficiency, and impaired throwing performance. There are both non-surgical and surgical treatment options. Signs and symptoms Ligaments of the left elbow. Red arrows mark the location of the UCL. Anatomy of the ulnar collateral ligament in the pitcher's elbow Pain along the inside of the elbow is the main symptom of this condition. Throwing athletes report it occurs most often during the acceleration phase of throwing. Closing the hand and clenching the fist has also been shown to reproduce the painful symptoms. The injury is often associated with an experience of a sharp ‚Äúpop‚Äù in the elbow, followed by pain during a single throw. In addition, swelling and bruising of the elbow, loss of elbow range of motion, and a sudden decrease in throwing velocity are all common symptoms of a UCL injury. If the injury is less severe, pain can be minimal with complete rest. Causes The UCL is important because it stabilizes the elbow from being abducted. If intense or repeated bouts of valgus stress occur on the UCL, injury will most likely transpire. Damage to the ulnar collateral ligament is common among baseball pitchers and javelin throwers because the throwing motion is similar. Physicians believe repetitive movements, especially pitching in baseball, cause adolescents' UCL injuries. Furthermore, physicians have stated that if an adolescent throws over 85 throws for 8 months or more in a year, or throw when exhausted, the adolescent has a significantly higher risk of succumbing to a UCL surgery.Fleisig, Glenn S., et al. \\"Prevention of elbow injuries in youth baseball pitchers.\\" Current sports medicine reports 8.5 (2009): 250-254. Gridiron football, racquet sports, ice hockey and water polo players have also been treated for damage to the ulnar collateral ligament.http://www.athleticadvisor.com/Injuries/UE/ucl_injuries.htm Specific overhead movements like those that occur during baseball pitching, tennis serving or volleyball spiking increase the risk of UCL injury. During the cocking phase of pitching, the shoulder is horizontally abducted, externally rotated and the elbow is flexed. There is slight stress on the UCL in this position but it increases when the shoulder is further externally rotated. The greater the stress the more the UCL is stretched causing strain. During the overhead throwing motion, valgus stress on the medial elbow occurs during arm cocking and acceleration. The initiation of valgus stress occurs at the conclusion of the arm-cocking phase. In the transitional moment from arm cocking to arm acceleration, the shoulder vigorously rotates internally, the forearm is in near full supination, and the elbow flexes from 90¬∞ to approximately 125¬∞. From late cocking to ball release, the elbow rapidly extends from approximately 125¬∞ to 25¬∞ at ball release.leisig GS, Escamilla RF: Biomechanics of the elbow in the throwing athlete. Oper Tech Sports Med 4: 62 ‚Äì68,1996 This causes tremendous valgus stress and tensile strain on the UCL. Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament are believed to result from poor throwing mechanics, overuse, high throwing velocities, and throwing certain types of pitches, such as curveballs.http://carlykreps.tripod.com/tommyjohn/id3.html Poor mechanics along with high repetition of these overhead movements can cause irritation, micro-tears or ruptures of the UCL. Injuries to the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in baseball players are rarely due to one-time, traumatic events. Rather, they are more often due to small chronic tears that accumulate over time. Anatomy The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL, also known as medial collateral ligament) is located on the medial side of the elbow. The UCL complex comprises three ligaments: the anterior oblique, posterior oblique and transverse ligaments. The anterior oblique ligament (AOL) attaches from the undersurface of the medial epicondyle to the medial ulnar surface slightly below the coronoid process. It is the sturdiest of the three sections within the UCL. The AOL acts as the primary restraint against valgus stress at the elbow during flexion and extension. The posterior oblique originates at the medial epicondyle and inserts along the mid-portion of the medial semilunar notch. It applies more stability against valgus stress when the elbow is flexed rather than extended. The transverse ligament connects to the inferior medial coronoid process of the ulna to the medial tip of the olecranon. Since it is connected to the same bone and not across the elbow joint, the transverse ligament has no contribution to the joint‚Äôs stability. Diagnosis In most cases, a physician will diagnose an ulnar collateral ligament injury using a patient‚Äôs medical history and a physical examination that includes a valgus stress test. The valgus stress test is performed on both arms and a positive test is indicated by pain on the affected arm that is not present on the uninvolved side.http://at.uwa.edu/Special%20Tests/SpecialTests/UpperBody/elbow%20Main.htm Physicians often utilize imaging techniques such as ultrasound, x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging or arthroscopic surgery to aid with making a proper diagnosis. =Classification= A slow and chronic deterioration of the ulnar collateral ligament can be due to repetitive stress acting on the ulna. At first, pain can be bearable and can worsen to an extent where it can terminate an athlete‚Äôs career. The repetitive stress placed on the ulna causes micro tears in the ligament resulting in the loss of structural integrity over time. The acute rupture is less common compared to the slow deterioration injury. The acute rupture occurs in collisions when the elbow is in flexion such as that in a wrestling match or a tackle in football. The ulnar collateral ligament distributes over fifty percent of the medial support of the elbow. This can result in an ulnar collateral ligament injury or a dislocated elbow causing severe damage to the elbow and the radioulnar joints. Treatments Grip strengthening exercises Pronating forearm Supination exercise UCL injuries may or may not require surgery. Non surgical treatment will primarily focus on strengthening the elbow joint to regain strength and stability.http://www.hopkinsortho.org/ucl.html First a course of RICE (Rest, ice, compression, elevation) is typically coupled with NSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to help alleviate pain and swelling. When the swelling has subsided, individual exercises or physical therapy may be prescribed to strengthen muscles around the elbow joint to compensate for tearing in the UCL. These may include biceps curls (non resistance and resistance), pronating and supinating the forearm, and grip strengthening exercises, performed with low resistance and moderate repetitions no more than three times a week. Surgical treatment may help restore the ability to perform the overhand throwing motions most commonly associated with UCL injuries. The reconstructive surgery, generally known as Tommy John surgery, was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 and has modified several times over the past 30 years.Erickson, Brandon J. \\"The epidemic of Tommy John surgery: the role of the orthopedic surgeon.\\" Am J Orthop (Belle Mead NJ) 44.1 (2015): E36-37. The surgery involves an autograft of the palmaris longus tendon (mostly seen as an accessory tendon) or an allograft of tissue from a cadaver or donor. The new tendon is attached by drilling holes in the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the sublime tubercle of the ulna and lacing the tendon through them in a figure eight.http://www.athleticadvisor.com/injuries/UE/ucl_injuries.htm The patient may begin physical therapy shortly after. It usually takes about 15 months after the surgery for standard rehabilitation. In study conducted by Dr. Frederick Azar, 78 Tommy John surgeries were performed and analyzed after the surgeries. Of the 78 patients, 8 of them (8.8%) reported complications. Two patients had superficial infections that resolved with oral antibiotics, two patients reported tightness of tenderness at the surgery site, and one had a superficial wound infection at the elbow incision that resolved with oral antibiotics. One patient developed postoperative ulnar nerve damage. Two patients had damages to the posteromedial part of the olecranon and required to have reoperation. Recent studies have shown that MLB pitchers who undergo Tommy John surgery return to pitch in the MLB 83% of the time and only 3% fail to return to pitch in the MLB or the minor league. Recently, there has been a recorded increase of Tommy John surgery. The increase is related to the false perception that the surgery improves the stability of the UCL joint. Many athletes believe in this false perception and cause them to lie about their symptoms in hopes to undergo the surgery. In order to combat these rumors, physicians are motivated to educate the public that Tommy John surgeries are only for those who have severe UCL injuries. The surgery will have an insignificant effect if the patient does not have a severe UCL injury.Longman, Jere. \\"Fit young pitchers see elbow repair as cure-all.\\" The New York Times (2007). The tendon chosen is then woven in a figure eight pattern through the humerus and ulna, which holes were first drilled in the bones. After surgery occurs, rehabilitation comes into place and usually takes about a year because a tendon needs time to convert into a ligament. Epidemiology According to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-9-CM, in 2008 the U.S. listed the diagnosis code for UCL injury as 841.1: Sprain ulnar collateral ligament. There were a total of 336 discharges of UCL injuries. Within the total discharges, separated by age groups: 18- to 44-year-olds; 165 people (49.17%). 45- to 64-year-olds; 91 (27.08%). 65- to 84-year-olds, 65 (19.35%) it shows that the ulnar collateral ligament injuries were more commonly found in men than women. There were 213 men compared to 123 women with ulnar collateral ligament injury. Most of these injuries were also paid through private insurance (170: 50.63%) and Medicare (70: 20.85%).U.S. Department of Health & Human Services: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality - Advancing Excellence in Health Care. .

It has a flattened body with three longitudinal ridges, which give it its name. Sources The single known specimen of Tricarina was discovered in a well core that had been bored at a site on the Khuzestan Plain in south- western Iran, at , and at a depth of . The rocks that contain it are calcareous shales, which form part of the Gadvan Formation, and are part of the main sequence of rocks for the production oil and gas around the Persian Gulf. Examination of the foraminiferan fossils show that the shales are Barremian to Aptian in age. Description The fossil of Tricarina gadvanensis is known from a part and counterpart from a core drilled to make an oil well. It has been deposited in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as specimen number CM 54197\\\\. A segment of the cylindrical core was cut away before the fossil was discovered, and the fossil is accordingly incomplete: the front of the carapace extends over the cut edge, and much of the pleon is outside the edge of the core. Most of the carapace is visible, and shows a flattened form, with three distinct longitudinal carinae or ridges. The bases of the antennae are preserved, but no eyes are apparent. A single pereiopod (walking leg) is visible, and it ends without a chela (claw). Systematics Feldmann et al. (2007) classified Tricarina gadvanensis as a decapod crustacean. According to Feldmann et al., T. gadvanensis cannot be accommodated in any of the previously known families of Decapoda. The few families which contain species with flattened bodies, such as Scyllaridae and the various families of Polychelida, all have very different ridge patterns. They therefore erected a new family, Tricarinidae, to accommodate this single genus and species. The lack of claws suggests affinity to slipper lobsters and spiny lobsters, and the new family is therefore placed in the inraorder Achelata. The genus name ' refers to the three ridges on the carapace, while the specific epithet ' refers to the area from which the fossil was recovered. Subsequent restudy of the fossil led Hy≈æn√Ω et al. (2020) to conclude that T. gadvanensis was not a decapod, but rather an isopod, probably closely related to the family Serolidae. Ecology The lack of eyes in Tricarina suggests a deep-water organism, a feature also seen in Polychelidae and Thaumastochelidae. This is also corroborated by the rocks it was found in, which are thought to have been deposited in a deep, offshore setting. It is probable that Tricarina burrowed into the sediment, as was also inferred for Eryon, and as seen in some slipper lobsters.

The need of the day was to give the region a boost in higher education to facilities its growth and development. It was Prof. Satyakali Mukherjee who had submitted a proposal for the first time for opening a college in Asansol in 1944 to the existing Chairman of Asansol Municipality, Mr. Jogendranath Roy and the then SDO, Mr. Woodford, I.C.S. This is noble endeavor was supported by eminent stalwarts of Society as well as the general people of different strata who donated generously for the establishment of a higher academic institution. A leading businessman and entrepreneur, Mr. G.S.Atwal initiated the move by constructing a field-building for the purpose in 1944 which was named Asansol College, affiliated to the University of Calcutta. I.A. Classes began with a students strength of only 132. However, after this humble beginning, different corporate bodies and education stalwarts of Asansol, eminent representative of the society holding high positions, along with positive effort of the staff of Asansol Municipal Corporation and the Eastern Railway, collectively contributed towards to establishment of this college, A renowned businessman of the locality, who was also a freedom fighter, a social reformer as well as a visionary, Sri Banwarilal Bhalotia, magnanimously donated a plot of land of 20 Bighas towards a permanent building for the asansol College, Not of less importance is the impetus and support of Late Sri Shivdas Ghatak and Dr. B.C.

The survivors fled to the villages on the other side of the Buriganga, in the region now known as Keraniganj. Shankharibazar became deserted and dead bodies remained on the streets for quite a long time. The Pakistani establishment renamed the Shankharibazar Road to Tikka Khan Road.  Background  Shankharibazar is a Hindu locality in the heart of Old Dhaka. It is inhabited by the Shankharis, a Bengali Hindu caste still engaged in their traditional vocation of preparation of conch shell bangles from conch shells. The Pakistani occupation army camped at the Jagannath College and Brahmo Samaj, very near to the Shankharibazar Road. During the Operation Searchlight, Shankharibazar became the prime target of the Pakistani army.  Events  On the evening of 25 March, the Pakistani army took to the streets. They proceeded towards Sadar Ghat along the Nawabpur Road. At the crossing of Shankharibazar Road, they shelled a house, as a result of which a portion of the house got destroyed. Three people died in the shelling and five to six people were injured. On the afternoon of 26 March, the Pakistani army attacked Shankharibazar. They entered premises no. 47 and killed the father and younger brother of the family. The elder brother Amar Sur, who survived the massacre fled through the narrow lane in the rear of the house. The military men ordered the residents to come out of their houses. Then they came out they were shot to death. The Pakistani army continued their killing spree in the premises of the locality and killed around 50 Hindus. More than 200 Hindus were injured in the assault. The houses were set on fire. According to eyewitness accounts, 31 Hindus were killed in the residence of Chandan Sur alone. Chandan Sur was one of the established and influential men in the area. Before the elections, Khwaja Khairuddin of the Dhaka Nawab family had unsuccessfully tried to coerce Sur on his side. Khairuddin was contesting the elections against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. It has been alleged that during the massacre, Khwaja Khairuddin led the Pakistani military to the residence of Chandan Sur. According to Kalidas Baidya, 126 Hindus from the neighbourhood were rounded up in one house and shot to death.  Aftermath  Shankharibazar became a deserted locality. The Pakistani occupation army and their local collaborators looted the gold, jewellery and furniture in the houses. The Bihari Muslims occupied the houses and settled in the locality. The Pakistani establishment renamed the Shankharibazar Road to Tikka Khan Road. The survivors returned to their locality after the liberation of Bangladesh. By then the entire locality was in ruins. The Shankharis had to start the struggle of life afresh.  Memorial  In 1972, a memorial was erected on the eastern end of the Shankharibazar Road in memory of the victims of the Shankharibazar massacre. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman promised the family of the victims a compensation sum of 2,000 Taka, however the victim's family members haven't received any compensation till date. In 1997, on the occasion silver jubilee of Liberation of Bangladesh, the Shankharibazar published a souvenir where the names of the massacre victims were published.

This can include pedagogical ideas, mathematics education research frameworks, and curricular material. In practicing modern elementary mathematics, teachers may use new and emerging media and technologies like social media and video games, as well as applying new teaching techniques based on the individualization of learning, in-depth study of the psychology of mathematics education, and integrating mathematics with science, technology, engineering and the arts.  General practice  = Areas of mathematics = Making all areas of mathematics accessible to young children is a key goal of modern elementary mathematics. Author and academic Liping Ma calls for \\"profound understanding of fundamental mathematics\\" by elementary teachers and parents of learners, as well as learners themselves.Liping Ma, Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics: Teachers' Understanding of Fundamental Mathematics in China and the United States (Studies in Mathematical Thinking and Learning.), Lawrence Erlbaum, 1999, . * Algebra: Early algebra covers the approach to elementary mathematics which helps children generalize number and set ideas. * Probability and statistics: Modern technologies make probability and statistics accessible to elementary learners with tools such as computer-assisted data visualization. * Geometry: Specially developed physical and virtual manipulatives, as well as interactive geometry software, can make geometry (beyond basic sorting and measuring) available to elementary learners. * Calculus: New innovations, such as Don Cohen's map to calculus, which was developed using children's work and level of understanding, is making calculus accessible to elementary learners. * Problem solving: Creative problem solving, which contrasts with exercises in arithmetic, such as adding or multiplying numbers, is now a major part of elementary mathematics. Other areas of mathematics such as logical reasoning and paradoxes, which used to be reserved for advanced groups of learners, are now being integrated into more mainstream curricula. = Use of psychology = Psychology in mathematics education is an applied research domain, with many recent developments relevant to elementary mathematics. A major aspect is the study of motivation; while most young children enjoy some mathematical practices, by the age of seven to ten many lose interest and begin to experience mathematical anxiety. Constructivism and other learning theories consider the ways young children learn mathematics, taking child developmental psychology into account. Both practitioners and researchers focus on children's memory, mnemonic devices, and computer-assisted techniques such as spaces repetition. There is an ongoing discussion of relationships between memory, procedural fluency with algorithms, and conceptual understanding of elementary mathematics. Sharing songs, rhymes, visuals and other mnemonics is popular in teacher social networks. The understanding that young children benefit from hands-on learning is more than a century old, going back to the work of Maria Montessori. However, there are modern developments of the theme. Traditional manipulatives are now available on computers as virtual manipulatives, with many offering options not available in the physical world, such as zoom or cross-section of geometric shapes. Embodied mathematics, such as studies of numerical cognition or gestures in learning, are growing research topics in mathematics education. = Accommodating individual students = Modern tools such as computer-based expert systems allow higher individualization of learning. Students do mathematical work at their own pace, providing for each student's learning style, and scaling the same activity for multiple levels. Special education and gifted education in particular require level and style accommodations, such as using different presentation and response options. Changing some aspects of the environment, such as giving an auditory learner headphones with quiet music, can help children concentrate on mathematical tasks. Modern learning materials, both computer and physical, accommodate learners through the use of multiple representation, such as graphs, pictures, words, animations, symbols, and sounds. For example, recent research suggests that sign language isn't only a means of speaking for those who are deaf, but also a visual approach to communication and learning, appealing to many others students and particularly helping with mathematics. Another aspect of individual education is child-led learning, which is called unschooling when it encompasses most of the child's experiences. Child-led learning means incorporating mathematically rich projects that stem from personal interests and passions. Educators who support child-led learning need to provide tasks that are open to interpretation, and be ready to improvise, rather than prepare lessons ahead of time. This modern approach often involves seizing opportunities for discovery, and learning as the child's curiosity demands. This departure from conventional structured learning leaves the child free to explore his/her innate desires and curiosities. Child-led learning taps into the child's intrinsic love of learning. Problem solving can be an intensely individualized activity, with students working in their own ways and also sharing insights and results within groups. There are many means to one end, emphasizing the importance of creative approaches. Promoting discourse and focusing on language are important concepts for helping each students participate in problem solving meaningfully. Data-based assessment and comparison of learning methods, and ways children learn, is another big aspect of modern elementary mathematics.  Use of emerging technologies  = Computation technology = Modern computation technologies change elementary mathematics in several ways. Technology reduces the amount of attention, memory, and computation required by users, making higher mathematical topics accessible to young children. However, the main opportunity technology provides is not in making traditional mathematical tasks more accessible, but in introducing children to novel activities that are not possible without computers. For example, computer modeling allows children to change parameters in virtual systems created by educators and observe emergent mathematical behaviors, or remix and create their own models. The pedagogical approach of constructionism describes how creating algorithms, programs and models on computers promotes deep mathematical thinking. Technology allows children to experience these complex concepts in a more visual manner. Children use an interactive whiteboard. Computer algebra systems are software environments that support and scaffold working with symbolic expressions. Some computer algebra systems have intuitive, child-friendly interfaces and therefore can be used in Early Algebra. Interactive geometry software supports creation and manipulation of geometric constructions. Both computer algebra systems and interactive geometry software help with several cognitive limitations of young children, such as attention and memory. The software scaffolds step-by-step procedures, helping children focus attention. It has \\"undo\\" capabilities, lowering frustration when errors happen, and promoting creativity and exploration. Also, such software supports metacognition by making all steps in a problem or a construction visible and editable, so children can reflect on individual steps or the whole journey. = Social media = Online communities and forums allow educators, researchers and students to share, discuss and remix elementary mathematical content they find or create. Sometimes, traditional media such as texts, pictures and movies are digitized and turned into online social objects, such as open textbooks. Other times, web-native mathematical objects are created, remixed and shared within the integrated authoring and discussion environment, such as applets made with Scratch or Geogebra constructions. Rich media, including video, virtual manipulatives, interactive models and mobile applications is a characteristic feature of online mathematical communication. Some global collaboration projects between teachers or groups of students with teachers use the web mostly for communication, but others happen in virtual worlds, such as Whyville. Professional development for elementary mathematics educators uses social media in the form of online courses, discussion forums, webinars, and web conferences. This supports teachers in forming PLNs (Personal Learning Networks). Some communities include both students and teachers, such as Art of Problem Solving.  Teaching mathematics in context  = Games and play = Learning through play is not new, but the themes of computer and mobile games are relatively more modern. Most teachers now use games in elementary classrooms, and most children in developed countries play learning games at home. Computer games with intrinsically mathematical game mechanics can help children learn novel topics. More extrinsic game mechanics and gamification can be used for time and task management, fluency, and memorization. Sometimes it's not obvious what mathematics children learn by \\"just playing,\\" but basic spatial and numerical skills gained in free play help with mathematical concepts. Some abstract games such as chess can benefit learning mathematics by developing systems thinking, logic, and reasoning. Roleplaying games invite children to become a character who uses mathematics in daily life or epic adventures, and often use mathematical storytelling. Sandbox, also called open world games, such as Minecraft help children explore patterns, improvise, be mathematically artistic, and develop their own algorithms. Board games can have all of the above aspects, and also promote communication about mathematics in small groups. Teachers working with disadvantaged kids note especially large mathematical skill gains after using games in the classroom, possibly because kids don't play such games at home. Many teachers, parents and students design their own games or create versions of existing games. Designing mathematically rich games is one of staple tasks in constructionism. There is a concern that children who use computer games and technology in general may be more stressed when exposed to pen-and-paper tests. = Family mathematics and everyday mathematics = While learning mathematics in daily life, such as cooking and shopping, can't be considered modern, social media provides new twists. Online networks help parents and teachers share tips on how to integrate daily routines and more formal mathematical learning for children. For example, the \\"Let's play math\\" blog hosts carnivals for sharing family mathematics ideas, such as using egg cartoons for quick mathematical games. School tasks may involve families collecting data and aggregating it online for mathematical explorations. Pastimes such as geocaching involve families sharing mathematically rich sporting activities that depend on GPS systems or mobile devices. Museums, clubs, stores, and other public places provide blended learning opportunities, with visiting families accessing science and mathematics activities related to the place on their mobile devices. = , social sciences, and the arts = In the last several decades, many prominent mathematicians and mathematics enthusiasts embraced mathematical arts, from popular fractal art to origami. Likewise, elementary mathematics is becoming more artistic. Some popular topics for children include tessellation, computer art, symmetry, patterns, transformations and reflections. The discipline of ethnomathematics studies relationships between mathematics and cultures, including arts and crafts. Some hands-on activities, such as creating tiling, can help children and grown-ups see mathematical art all around them. Project-based learning approaches help students explore mathematics together with other disciplines. For example, children's robotics projects and competitions include mathematical tasks. Some elementary mathematical topics, such as measurement, apply to tasks in many professions and subject areas. Unit studies centered on such concepts contrast with project-based learning, where students use many concepts to achieve the project's goal.

Elicitor molecules can attach to special receptor proteins located on plant cell membranes. These receptors are able to recognize the molecular pattern of elicitors and trigger intracellular defence signalling via the Octadecanoid pathway. This response results in the enhanced synthesis of metabolites which reduce damage and increase resistance to pest, disease or environmental stress. This is an immune response known as pattern triggered immunity or PTI. PTI is effective against necrotrophic microorganisms. An example is chitosan which is found in insects, fungi and the shells of crustaceans. Chitosan is used in agriculture as a natural biocontrol agent, to improve plant health and increase crop yields.  Effectors and Hormones  Effectors and hormones are other signalling molecules often confused with elicitors. Elicitors and effectors differ from hormones in that they are not produced within the organism that they are triggering a response in, and are usually not naturally occurring in the organism. = Plant Hormones = Plant hormones are signalling molecules produced within the plant (i.e. they are endogenous). Hormones regulate cellular processes in targeted cells locally and can be moved to other parts of the plant. Examples of plant hormones are auxins, cytokins, gibberellin, ethylene, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and jasmonates. Hormones naturally occur in extremely low, finely balanced, concentrations. Plant hormones act as plant growth regulators or modulators. Modulators are defined as molecules that \\"bind to a particular target protein, mainly to an enzyme, thereby directly changing its activity, i.e. increasing or decreasing\\". An example is salicylic acid which is a modulator of catalase isozymes activity and jasmonate, which modulates phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity. = Effectors = Effectors are proteins secreted by microbial pathogens which can either trigger or compromise immunity depending on the ability of perception (presence of suitable receptor) and response (appropriate defence reaction) of the plant. Effector could be extracellular or injected directly into cells. Microorganisms are able to inject effectors directly into host cells to by- pass induced defences in plants. This compromises the host plant's defence system and is referred to as effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS). The remaining immunity is called basal defense which can limit the spread of virulent pathogens in their hosts but it is typically insufficient to prevent disease. In response to this threat, plant's have evolved effector recognition protein receptors to recognise, or monitor, effectors and initiate effector- triggered immunity (ETI). ETI is a strong immune response that efficiently protects plants from avirulent biotrophic pathogens and is often associated with the hypersensitive reaction (HR), a form of programmed death of plant cells at infection sites.  Crop Protection and Commercialisation of Elicitors  Elicitors can protect crops from diseases, stress and damage. Elicitors do not need to be directly toxic for pathogenic organisms or pests to be of benefit. Therefore, they are an alternative to conventional pesticides which are often harmful for the environment, farmers and consumers and for which consumers are increasingly seeking safer alternatives.

He played List A cricket for Kent until 1980, making six appearances, the last of which came against Middlesex in the 1980 John Player League. Spelman, whose main role was a bowler, took 7 wickets in his six List A matches, which came at an average of 27.71, with best figures of 3/30. It wasn't until 1980 that Spelman made his first-class debut for the county against Sussex in the County Championship. He made six further first-class appearances for Kent, the last of which came against Oxford University in 1982. In his seven first-class appearances, he took 10 wickets at an average of 35.70, with best figures of 2/27.

She is remembered as one of the first Danish women to open her own architecture studio and for her interest in social housing in the 1930s. Early life Grubb completed her schooling at N√∏rre Gymnasium in 1921. As a child she was interested in architecture. After studying old buildings during a long trip to Italy and Switzerland, she realized she wanted to become an architect. In 1922, she attended technical school and the following year was admitted to study architecture at the Danish Academy, graduating in 1933. During her studies, she took on part-time work with Kaj Gottlob, Povl Baumann and Knud S√∏rensen. Career In 1935, Grubb set up her own studio, quite an unusual occurrence for women architects at the time. The initiative was based on her winning a competition in 1934 for Kvindernes Bygning (the Women's Building) in Niels Hemmingsens Gade in Copenhagen. The idea was to bring together women involved in good causes as well as philanthropists in a common location. Completed in 1936, the ferro-concrete building comprised a hotel, offices and meeting rooms. The facade had horizontally set windows and a recessed attic floor. The building was designed with the latest architectural features of the day in the Functionalist style. In 1937, together with Karen Hvistendahl and Ingeborg Schmidt, Grubb won the first prize in the Foreningen Socialt Boligbyyeri (Social Housing Association) competition for designing housing for low-income families. Social housing became Grubb's main interest. She was an active proponent for apartments with two or three small bedrooms and more open planning than traditional two-room apartments which served working-class families with several children. She also developed the apartments' interior decoration and furnishing with light wooden furniture. In 1939‚Äì1940, she completed one of the large social apartment buildings of Bispebjerg.Jette Lokvig, \\"Ragna Grubb (1903-1961)\\", Danske Kvindebiografiske Leksikon. Retrieved 5 February 2012. In 1937, Grubb married the architect Christian Laursen who occasionally assisted her although he was usually engaged in other work. As family commitments increasingly weighed on her time, her later work was devoted to a few private homes and summer houses and to restoration.Erik Ejlers, \\"Ragna Grubb\\", Kunstleksikon Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon\\".

Tanks were used, the first operational use of tanks in India. The First Mohmand campaign in 1897‚Äì98 followed earlier military expeditions in 1851‚Äì1852, 1854, 1864, 1879, 1880. After the First Mohmand campaign, there was the Mohmand expedition of 1908 and the Mohmand and Bajaur operations of 1933, taking about a month in August. In 1935 the Mohmands, influenced by the Haji of Turangzai and his three sons the Badshah Guls, were marauding in the plains. At the end of July about 2000 tribesmen were disrupting working parties repairing the Mohinand‚ÄìGandab road.The Times (London) 21 July p11, 6 August p9 The Government decided to send a sizeable punitive force against them, called the Mohmand Force or Mohforce. The force, mobilised by 17 August, included the Nowshera and Peshawar Brigades of the Indian Army, a section of the Royal Tank Corps, the 18th King Edward's Own Cavalry, and the 22nd Derajat Mountain Battery (Frontier Force), with air support from the Indian Wing commanded by Basil Embry.The Times (London) 19 August p10 The commanders of the Peshawar and Nowshera Brigades, Claude Auchinleck and Harold Alexander, both rose to high rank in World War II. Auchinleck, the senior Brigadier, commanded Mohforce; as the Peshawar District G.O.C. General Muspratt was on leave in Britain. Mohforce left near the end of summer, with two tanks in front of the leading troops which could be used to outflank tribesman who pinned down the infantry. The tanks were Vickers Mark IIB, with a single Vickers machine gun. They did not have their radios, which had been withdrawn for their annual overhaul, so one tank had to act as a ‚Äúrunner‚Äù between the tanks and the infantry. The Mohmands, having no word for tanks, called them ‚Äúthe snakes that spit‚Äù. The troops advanced into the Kamalai plateau, the tribal heartland west of the Swat River. The road and water supply had to be extended, taking six weeks, before they could advance into the Nahakki Pass. Then the heights around the Nahakki Pass were taken in a night operation, and after dawn the cavalry went through the pass to the plain beyond. The headquarters, now commanded by General Muspratt, was established about 5 miles south of the Nahakki Pass at Kamalai. In September a reconnaissance in force southwest of Nahakki was ambushed, with 35 deaths in Mohforce: 2 British and 2 Indian officers, and 1 British and 30 Indian Other Ranks; the operation by the Guides or 5th/12th Frontier Force Regiment was described as ‚Äúsketchily planned and uncoordinated‚Äù Connell (1959) p61 After fierce fighting, attackers were driven off and British created a campaign to fight the Pashtuns. This put an end to the tribal revolt and order was reinforced. The Badmanai Pass was captured by the British force which ended the tribal hold at Jarobi. But the septs and subtribes asked for peace at jirgas and agreed to British terms. Order was restored but the British force remained in area till all the fines were collected. After fines were collected, British troops withdrew to British territory towards the end of October.The Times (London) 2 September p9, 5 September p11 Auchinleck's brigade withdrew with drums and pipes playing. Captain Godfrey Meynell was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his gallantry on 29 September at the Nahqi Pass.  Background  The Mohmands are a Pashtun hill tribe who lived north-west of Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province of British India; now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. They moved annually across the border to the hills of Afghanistan to escape the summer heat; the border was delineated by the Durand Line in 1893 but was poorly defined.

His parents were Count Wolrad I of Waldeck and Barbara of Wertheim (b. 1422). As a younger son, Philip was originally destined for a career in the church, but after his elder brother Philip I died, he left the clergy for dynastic reasons and ruled the County of Waldeck as regent for his underage nephew Henry VIII. In 1486, Philip and his nephew divided the county, with Philip II receiving Waldeck- Eisenberg and Henry VIII receiving Waldeck-Widlungen. In 1499, a very rich gold vein was discovered in Eisenberg, and after three years there was a long dispute between the Counts of Waldeck and the Lord of Viermund about the mining rights on Mount Eisenberg. In 1505, Duke William IV of J√ºlich-Berg allowed Philip II as his governor to operate mines in the districts of Ravensberg and Sparrenberg. Apart from Philip, the board of the mining company included two bailiffs for William IV, representatives of the City of Bielefeld, including both mayors, and a mining expert from Thuringia. In 1507, he acquired Steffenburg Castle, which had been constructed in Adorf by Curd von Ense in the early 16th Century. He was an ally of Archbishop Albert of Mainz, which was why his was taken prisoner in March 1516 in Padberg by G√∂tz von Berlichingen, who was fighting a feud against Albert at the time.

It was built in the 13th century, but there is some debate as to who actually built the castle, either Gilbert de Clare or the Lord of Senghennydd. The castle appears to have never been occupied or completed. It is now a scheduled monument and a Grade II listed building. Archaeological investigations and interpretations The interior of Morgraig Castle Morgraig Castle is located in Caerphilly, on the escarpment of Craig Llanishen, close to the border between the counties of Caerphilly and Cardiff. It was built after 1243, but before 1267. The castle was first discovered by a group of archaeologists from the Cardiff Museum led by John Ward in the summer of 1895. Ward was aware of stories telling of an ancient British fort and was interested in the particular site because he had seen maps that showed an unusual rectangular shape. Ward oversaw excavations on the site beginning in summer 1903 with excavation financed by Lord Windsor. Ward along with architect J.W. Rodger and historian J.S. Corbett suggested that the castle was built in the 13th century. Since its discovery, there has been debate about the ruins. In 1997, newspaper articles appeared claiming that the castle was the location where a Welsh rebellion against English rule was defeated in 1315. In 1997‚Äì98, Cadw, the historic environment service of the Welsh Government, and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales undertook the first major study of the site.Cadw, Work of Jack Spurgeon, Heritage in Wales magazine Amateur historian Jack Spurgeon believes that the builder of Morgraig was an Anglo-Norman lord. He notes that it has some features that suggest it was of Welsh construction, but that inference is contradicted by the absence of ditches, which he considered indicative of North Welsh design at the time. In the 13th century the castle would have stood on the border between the Welsh Lordship of Senghenydd and the English Lordship of Glamorgan. The lack of evidence of roofing materials or internal buildings at the site is interpreted to mean that the castle was never completed or occupied. The battlements found by Ward have now disappeared, but the shape of the walls of towers and the presence of a newel post indicate a spiral staircase rising from the first floor. This would have been unusual in a Welsh castle. In addition, carved stones for doorways and windows suggest an English castle. Cadw argue that the castle must have been built by the English because of two factors related to a type of stone used in its construction, known as Sutton stone. Sutton stone was obtained from only one quarry that was depleted in the Middle Ages. According to Cadw, the castle could only have been built during the period that the quarry was in use. They also argue that only the English could have obtained the stone because the site of the quarry near Ogmore-by- Sea would have been defended by the de Clare family, at nearby Ogmore Castle, who opposed the Lord of Senghennydd. A South-facing rectangular tower of Morgraig Castle However, a study by Brian Davies of the Gelligaer Historical Society in March 2009 suggests that the castle keep and plain entrance are both features of a Welsh castle. In addition, the Gelligaer Historical Society study suggests that relations between the Lord of Senghennydd and the de Clares were generally friendly at least until the Second Barons' War of 1264‚Äì1267. The Second Barons' War was a civil war in England between barons led by Simon de Montfort and Henry III. At first, de Clare and the Lord of Senghenydd were allied, but in 1266, after the Lord of Senghenydd and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd aligned themselves with Simon de Montfort, Gilbert de Clare arrested the Lord of Senghenydd. In 1257 the de Clare family lost control in the area when Llywelyn ap Gruffudd destroyed their castle at Llangynwyd. Cadw argue that the Lord of Senghennydd would then have been able to obtain Sutton stone to build Morgraig Castle. The Gelligaer Historical Society study suggests that Llywelyn ap Gruffydd had sent his surveyor to help build Morgraig Castle for the Lord of Senghenydd. Gilbert de Clare responded by beginning to construct the larger Caerphilly Castle in 1268. The partially completed Caerphilly Castle was burned down in October 1269 by Llewellyn the Last, but construction began again in 1271 and Caerphilly Castle was ultimately completed. The unfinished Morgraig Castle may have been abandoned at this point because it had no strategic importance to Gilbert de Clare, with much of its stone work being used elsewhere, including Caerphilly Castle. The castle is now a scheduled monument and a Grade II listed building.

He is best remembered for his stories Shum Bola (The Mischievous Boy) (adapted for film in 1977) and Yodgor. G ªafur G ªulom is also known for translating the works of many influential foreign authors, such as Alexander Pushkin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and William Shakespeare. He translated Le Mariage de Figaro of Pierre Beaumarchais, Othello of William Shakespeare, and Gulistan of Saadi Shirazi into Uzbek. G ªafur G ªulom is considered to be one of the most influential Uzbek writers of the 20th century. He is also regarded as one of the founders of modern Uzbek poetry along with Hamza Hakimzoda Niyoziy. G ªafur G ªulom received the prestigious State Stalin Prize in 1946 and became a National Poet of the Uzbek SSR in 1963. Life G ªafur G ªulomovich G ªulomov was born to a poor family on May 10, 1903, in Tashkent. His father, G ªulom Mirza Orif, knew Russian and was fond of reading poems and could himself write poetry. He died when G ªafur G ªulom was only nine years old. G ªafur G ªulom first went to a so-called old school, a quasi-Muslim school, and later enrolled in a Russian tuzem school (), an elementary school for non-Russians in Turkestan. After completing a teacher preparation program, he started to teach at a contemporary school. In 1923, he was appointed the head of the curriculum department at an orphanage. During that time G ªafur G ªulom also started working on the editorial board of different publications, such as Kambag ªal dehqon (The Poor Farmer), Qizil O ªzbekiston (Red Uzbekistan), and Sharq haqiqati (The Truth of the East). Working on editorial boards gave him a chance to learn about the life of ordinary citizens. G ªafur G ªulom died of illness at the age of sixty three on July 10, 1966, in Tashkent. Works The building of the Uzbek Gymnasium in Isfana in 2008 with lines from a G ªafur G ªulom poem written at the front. The lines read: \\"Dear excellent child of an excellent state, know that your motherland awaits you.\\" G ªafur G ªulom's first poetry collections, Dinamo (Dynamo) and Tirik qo ªshiqlar (Alive Songs), were published in 1931 and 1932, respectively. In these books he criticized the unsophisticated traditions of the peoples of Turkestan and praised the diligent work of ordinary citizens. In the 1930s, in addition to numerous short stories, essays, and satirical articles, G ªafur G ªulom wrote many longer narratives, such as Netay (What Should I Do?), Yodgor, and Tirilgan murda (The Corpse that Came Alive). During the Soviet-German war against Nazi Germany and its allies, G ªafur G ªulom devoted his time and efforts to writing about the war. His poems Sen yetim emassan (You're not an Orphan), Oltin medal (The Golden Medal), Kuzatish (Seeing off), Vaqt (Time), and Sog ªinish (Missing) became highly popular among Uzbeks. In 1943, G ªafur G ªulom became a member of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan. During the last 20 years of his life, he published almost twenty poetry books. Many of his works have been translated into other languages. G ªafur G ªulom received many awards and honors throughout his life. He was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour in 1944. For his compilation of poems about the Soviet-German war, Sharqdan kelayotirman (I'm Coming from the East), G ªafur G ªulom was awarded the State Stalin Prize in 1946. He received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour twice, in 1939 and 1963. He was also twice awarded the Order of Lenin. In 1970, he was posthumously awarded the Lenin Prize. In 2000, G ªafur G ªulom was posthumously awarded the National Order of Merit (), one of independent Uzbekistan's most prestigious medals.

Taken over by the Great Western Railway, after nationalisation under British Railways they sold off the carriage and wagon works to the Pullman Company Ltd. Today, both the site of the railway depot and the carriage and wagon works have been redeveloped, mainly with buildings and commercial activities associated with the University of Cardiff. History The original locomotive works and drawing offices of the TVR were located in the West Yard of Cardiff Docks, co-located there so that use could be made of the local boiler makers skills. However, the TVR towards the end of the 19th century found it commercially advantageous to outsource the heavy industrialised work of building locomotives. Hence the West Yard facility became a heavy overhaul shop, something which the GWR on inheriting the TVR didn't change, as they had access to the Caerphilly railway works of the former-Rhymney Railway. The last locomotive to be built at West Yard was the power unit for No. 1 steam railcar, in 1903. However, the TVR still needed a carriage and wagon works, so reliant were they on the transportation of coal. Ideally located close to Cardiff Docks, the site chosen was just north of Cathays railway station, as the line headed towards Llandaf railway station, in the Cathays suburb of Cardiff. =Carriage and wagon works= A 6-road facility north of the TVR mainline, the carriage and wagon works were capable of both producing and maintaining the complete TVR and private owner range of rolling stock. The works was assured of work, as the TVR handled some 10,000 coal wagons and a further 3,000 pieces of passenger and other freight stock. The GWR for the same reasons of revenue protection fully maintained the facility, but with the introduction of steel wagons post-World War II, British Railways saw no need for the continued use of the facility. They hence sold off the business and leased the site to the Pullman Company Ltd, who maintained their own carriages along with some private owner wagons and BR stock. By the mid-1980s, the site was virtually unmanned, occasionally used for over-day holding of engineers trains that were travelling into or from the valleys. =Cathays depot= Collett-designed 5600 Class 0-6-2T No.6682 simmers in April 1951, outside the former TVR railway depot at Cathays Located on the southside of the tracks to the carriage and wagon works, parallel to Colum Road, it was the largest railway depot on the TVR. Opened in 1884, it was equipped with a five-road shed and an attached five-road repair shop, each under its own bay built from local brick. The roofs were to a similar pattern, each with extensive glazing on both faces. The GWR had supplied a standard-pattern over-grider pattern railway turntable, which was never extended as it could cope with the tank engines allocated to the site. Designated by the GWR as the divisional shed of the Cardiff Valleys Division, under the Loans and Guarantees Act (1929): the track layout was improved; a new corrugated roof installed; and a new ramp added to the GWR standard- pattern single-road coaling stage. By 1950 under British Railways, the combined depots of Cathays and Radyr (Code:88A), had a complement of 82 locomotives, all tank-types: 2x2-8-2T; 62x0-6-2T; 15x0-6-0T; 3x0-4-2T. In 1959 the shed was divided to cope with the introduction of diesel multiple units. In 1961 the shed closed to steam, and all steam locomotives were moved to Radyr. The shed closed completely in November 1964, with the opening of the newly diesel-redeveloped Cardiff Canton TMD. Shortly afterwards the site was cleared for redevelopment. Present The site today, 15 September 2007. To the left is Colum Drive, marking the site of the earlier demolished Cathays depot. To the right is a Lidl store, a later development on the site of the former carriage and wagon works. Beyond the store is a newly developed student accommodation block The site of the former depot was left as scrub land until the late 1980s, when redevelopment started with the creation of the new Colum Drive, which runs parallel and adjacent to the railway line. Most of the land was redeveloped with buildings and activities associated with the University of Cardiff. The former carriage and wagon works buildings were still in existence until the early 2000s, when they too were demolished. The site now houses a new kit-built Lidl store, and to its north a University optometry unit and student accommodation block.

Early supercomputer architectures pioneered by Seymour Cray relied on compact innovative designs and local parallelism to achieve superior computational peak performance. However, in time the demand for increased computational power ushered in the age of massively parallel systems. While the supercomputers of the 1970s used only a few processors, in the 1990s, machines with thousands of processors began to appear and by the end of the 20th century, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of \\"off-the-shelf\\" processors were the norm. Supercomputers of the 21st century can use over 100,000 processors (some being graphic units) connected by fast connections. Throughout the decades, the management of heat density has remained a key issue for most centralized supercomputers. The large amount of heat generated by a system may also have other effects, such as reducing the lifetime of other system components. There have been diverse approaches to heat management, from pumping Fluorinert through the system, to a hybrid liquid-air cooling system or air cooling with normal air conditioning temperatures. Systems with a massive number of processors generally take one of two paths: in one approach, e.g., in grid computing the processing power of a large number of computers in distributed, diverse administrative domains, is opportunistically used whenever a computer is available. In another approach, a large number of processors are used in close proximity to each other, e.g., in a computer cluster. In such a centralized massively parallel system the speed and flexibility of the interconnect becomes very important, and modern supercomputers have used various approaches ranging from enhanced Infiniband systems to three- dimensional torus interconnects. Context and overview Since the late 1960s the growth in the power and proliferation of supercomputers has been dramatic, and the underlying architectural directions of these systems have taken significant turns. While the early supercomputers relied on a small number of closely connected processors that accessed shared memory, the supercomputers of the 21st century use over 100,000 processors connected by fast networks. Throughout the decades, the management of heat density has remained a key issue for most centralized supercomputers. Seymour Cray's \\"get the heat out\\" motto was central to his design philosophy and has continued to be a key issue in supercomputer architectures, e.g., in large-scale experiments such as Blue Waters. The large amount of heat generated by a system may also have other effects, such as reducing the lifetime of other system components. HS22 blade There have been diverse approaches to heat management, e.g., the Cray 2 pumped Fluorinert through the system, while System X used a hybrid liquid- air cooling system and the Blue Gene/P is air-cooled with normal air conditioning temperatures. The heat from the Aquasar supercomputer is used to warm a university campus. The heat density generated by a supercomputer has a direct dependence on the processor type used in the system, with more powerful processors typically generating more heat, given similar underlying semiconductor technologies. While early supercomputers used a few fast, closely packed processors that took advantage of local parallelism (e.g., pipelining and vector processing), in time the number of processors grew, and computing nodes could be placed further away,e.g., in a computer cluster, or could be geographically dispersed in grid computing. As the number of processors in a supercomputer grows, \\"component failure rate\\" begins to become a serious issue. If a supercomputer uses thousands of nodes, each of which may fail once per year on the average, then the system will experience several node failures each day. As the price/performance of general purpose graphic processors (GPGPUs) has improved, a number of petaflop supercomputers such as Tianhe-I and Nebulae have started to rely on them. However, other systems such as the K computer continue to use conventional processors such as SPARC-based designs and the overall applicability of GPGPUs in general purpose high performance computing applications has been the subject of debate, in that while a GPGPU may be tuned to score well on specific benchmarks its overall applicability to everyday algorithms may be limited unless significant effort is spent to tune the application towards it. However, GPUs are gaining ground and in 2012 the Jaguar supercomputer was transformed into Titan by replacing CPUs with GPUs. As the number of independent processors in a supercomputer increases, the way they access data in the file system and how they share and access secondary storage resources becomes prominent. Over the years a number of systems for distributed file management were developed, e.g., the IBM General Parallel File System, BeeGFS, the Parallel Virtual File System, Hadoop, etc. A number of supercomputers on the TOP100 list such as the Tianhe-I use Linux's Lustre file system. Early systems with a few processors The CDC 6600 series of computers were very early attempts at supercomputing and gained their advantage over the existing systems by relegating work to peripheral devices, freeing the CPU (Central Processing Unit) to process actual data. With the Minnesota FORTRAN compiler the 6600 could sustain 500 kiloflops on standard mathematical operations. Cray computers centralized access, keeping distances short and uniform. Other early supercomputers such as the Cray 1 and Cray 2 that appeared afterwards used a small number of fast processors that worked in harmony and were uniformly connected to the largest amount of shared memory that could be managed at the time. These early architectures introduced parallel processing at the processor level, with innovations such as vector processing, in which the processor can perform several operations during one clock cycle, rather than having to wait for successive cycles. In time, as the number of processors increased, different architectural issues emerged. Two issues that need to be addressed as the number of processors increases are the distribution of memory and processing. In the distributed memory approach, each processor is physically packaged close with some local memory. The memory associated with other processors is then \\"further away\\" based on bandwidth and latency parameters in non-uniform memory access. In the 1960s pipelining was viewed as an innovation, and by the 1970s the use of vector processors had been well established. By the 1980s, many supercomputers used parallel vector processors. The relatively small number of processors in early systems, allowed them to easily use a shared memory architecture, which allows processors to access a common pool of memory. In the early days a common approach was the use of uniform memory access (UMA), in which access time to a memory location was similar between processors. The use of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) allowed a processor to access its own local memory faster than other memory locations, while cache-only memory architectures (COMA) allowed for the local memory of each processor to be used as cache, thus requiring coordination as memory values changed. As the number of processors increases, efficient interprocessor communication and synchronization on a supercomputer becomes a challenge. A number of approaches may be used to achieve this goal. For instance, in the early 1980s, in the Cray X-MP system, shared registers were used. In this approach, all processors had access to shared registers that did not move data back and forth but were only used for interprocessor communication and synchronization. However, inherent challenges in managing a large amount of shared memory among many processors resulted in a move to more distributed architectures. Massive centralized parallelism A Blue Gene/L cabinet showing the stacked blades, each holding many processors During the 1980s, as the demand for computing power increased, the trend to a much larger number of processors began, ushering in the age of massively parallel systems, with distributed memory and distributed file systems, given that shared memory architectures could not scale to a large number of processors. Hybrid approaches such as distributed shared memory also appeared after the early systems. The computer clustering approach connects a number of readily available computing nodes (e.g. personal computers used as servers) via a fast, private local area network. The activities of the computing nodes are orchestrated by \\"clustering middleware\\", a software layer that sits atop the nodes and allows the users to treat the cluster as by and large one cohesive computing unit, e.g. via a single system image concept. Computer clustering relies on a centralized management approach which makes the nodes available as orchestrated shared servers. It is distinct from other approaches such as peer to peer or grid computing which also use many nodes, but with a far more distributed nature. By the 21st century, the TOP500 organization's semiannual list of the 500 fastest supercomputers often includes many clusters, e.g. the world's fastest in 2011, the K computer with a distributed memory, cluster architecture.TOP500 list To view all clusters on the TOP500 list select \\"cluster\\" as architecture from the \\"sublist menu\\" on the TOP500 site. When a large number of local semi-independent computing nodes are used (e.g. in a cluster architecture) the speed and flexibility of the interconnect becomes very important. Modern supercomputers have taken different approaches to address this issue, e.g. Tianhe-1 uses a proprietary high-speed network based on the Infiniband QDR, enhanced with FeiTeng-1000 CPUs. On the other hand, the Blue Gene/L system uses a three-dimensional torus interconnect with auxiliary networks for global communications. In this approach each node is connected to its six nearest neighbors. A similar torus was used by the Cray T3E. Massive centralized systems at times use special-purpose processors designed for a specific application, and may use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) chips to gain performance by sacrificing generality. Examples of special-purpose supercomputers include Belle,Condon, J.H. and K.Thompson, \\"Belle Chess Hardware\\", In Advances in Computer Chess 3 (ed.M.R.B.Clarke), Pergamon Press, 1982. Deep Blue, and Hydra, for playing chess, Gravity Pipe for astrophysics, MDGRAPE-3 for protein structure computation molecular dynamicsRIKEN press release, Completion of a one-petaflops computer system for simulation of molecular dynamics and Deep Crack, for breaking the DES cipher. Massive distributed parallelism Example architecture of a geographically disperse computing system connecting many nodes over a network Grid computing uses a large number of computers in distributed, diverse administrative domains. It is an opportunistic approach which uses resources whenever they are available. An example is BOINC a volunteer-based, opportunistic grid system. Some BOINC applications have reached multi-petaflop levels by using close to half a million computers connected on the internet, whenever volunteer resources become available.BOIN statistics, 2011 However, these types of results often do not appear in the TOP500 ratings because they do not run the general purpose Linpack benchmark. Although grid computing has had success in parallel task execution, demanding supercomputer applications such as weather simulations or computational fluid dynamics have remained out of reach, partly due to the barriers in reliable sub-assignment of a large number of tasks as well as the reliable availability of resources at a given time. In quasi- opportunistic supercomputing a large number of geographically disperse computers are orchestrated with built-in safeguards. The quasi-opportunistic approach goes beyond volunteer computing on a highly distributed systems such as BOINC, or general grid computing on a system such as Globus by allowing the middleware to provide almost seamless access to many computing clusters so that existing programs in languages such as Fortran or C can be distributed among multiple computing resources. Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing aims to provide a higher quality of service than opportunistic resource sharing. The quasi-opportunistic approach enables the execution of demanding applications within computer grids by establishing grid-wise resource allocation agreements; and fault tolerant message passing to abstractly shield against the failures of the underlying resources, thus maintaining some opportunism, while allowing a higher level of control. 21st-century architectural trends A person walking between the racks of a Cray XE6 supercomputer The air-cooled IBM Blue Gene supercomputer architecture trades processor speed for low power consumption so that a larger number of processors can be used at room temperature, by using normal air-conditioning. The second-generation Blue Gene/P system has processors with integrated node-to-node communication logic. It is energy-efficient, achieving 371 MFLOPS/W. The K computer is a water- cooled, homogeneous processor, distributed memory system with a cluster architecture.TOP500 list It uses more than 80,000 SPARC64 VIIIfx processors, each with eight cores, for a total of over 700,000 cores--almost twice as many as any other system. It comprises more than 800 cabinets, each with 96 computing nodes (each with 16 GB of memory), and 6 I/O nodes. Although it is more powerful than the next five systems on the TOP500 list combined, at 824.56 MFLOPS/W it has the lowest power to performance ratio of any current major supercomputer system. The follow up system for the K computer, called the PRIMEHPC FX10 uses the same six-dimensional torus interconnect, but still only one processor per node.Fujitsu Unveils Post-K SupercomputerHPC Wire Nov 7 2011 Unlike the K computer, the Tianhe-1A system uses a hybrid architecture and integrates CPUs and GPUs. It uses more than 14,000 Xeon general-purpose processors and more than 7,000 Nvidia Tesla general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) on about 3,500 blades. It has 112 computer cabinets and 262 terabytes of distributed memory; 2 petabytes of disk storage is implemented via Lustre clustered files.Tianhe-1A Tianhe-1 uses a proprietary high-speed communication network to connect the processors. The proprietary interconnect network was based on the Infiniband QDR, enhanced with Chinese made FeiTeng-1000 CPUs. In the case of the interconnect the system is twice as fast as the Infiniband, but slower than some interconnects on other supercomputers. The limits of specific approaches continue to be tested, as boundaries are reached through large scale experiments, e.g., in 2011 IBM ended its participation in the Blue Waters petaflops project at the University of Illinois.The Register: IBM yanks chain on 'Blue Waters' superThe Statesman IBM's Unix computer business is booming The Blue Waters architecture was based on the IBM POWER7 processor and intended to have 200,000 cores with a petabyte of \\"globally addressable memory\\" and 10 petabytes of disk space. The goal of a sustained petaflop led to design choices that optimized single-core performance, and hence a lower number of cores. The lower number of cores was then expected to help performance on programs that did not scale well to a large number of processors. The large globally addressable memory architecture aimed to solve memory address problems in an efficient manner, for the same type of programs. Blue Waters had been expected to run at sustained speeds of at least one petaflop, and relied on the specific water-cooling approach to manage heat. In the first four years of operation, the National Science Foundation spent about $200 million on the project. IBM released the Power 775 computing node derived from that project's technology soon thereafter, but effectively abandoned the Blue Waters approach. Architectural experiments are continuing in a number of directions, e.g. the Cyclops64 system uses a \\"supercomputer on a chip\\" approach, in a direction away from the use of massive distributed processors. Each 64-bit Cyclops64 chip contains 80 processors, and the entire system uses a globally addressable memory architecture. The processors are connected with non-internally blocking crossbar switch and communicate with each other via global interleaved memory. There is no data cache in the architecture, but half of each SRAM bank can be used as a scratchpad memory. Although this type of architecture allows unstructured parallelism in a dynamically non-contiguous memory system, it also produces challenges in the efficient mapping of parallel algorithms to a many-core system.

It is an agency of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and operates the Berlin Musical Instrument Museum. History The current Institute is a direct descendant of several institutions of the former Kingdom of Prussia. In 1888, a formalized collection of ancient musical instruments was established at the Prussian Royal Academy of Music. By 1902, the collection had grown substantially through the financial support of Wilhelm II. In 1919 Curt Sachs, one of the founders of the field of organology (the study of musical instruments), was appointed the first Director of the instrument collection. In 1917, an Institute for Musicological Research was also founded under the patronage of Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe in B√ºckeburg. At the start of the Third Reich in 1933, Sachs was dismissed and forced to emigrate by the Nazi Party. In 1935 a new National Institute for German Music Research was founded in Berlin, led by Max Seiffert, incorporating the old Royal College and the B√ºckeburg Institute. World War II then saw the nearly complete destruction of the Institute and the Museum. In 1943, the instruments, scores and library collections were evacuated from Berlin to protect them from Allied bombing. Despite extensive security, the majority were lost. In January 1945, \\"by Decree of the Reich Minister for Science, Education and Education\\", the Institute was closed. At war's end, only 700 of the original 4,000 musical instruments survived. After the war, what remained of the Institute came under the direct control of the West Berlin city government and a painstaking reconstruction began, with a focus on the valuable instruments collection. In 1949 it was given accommodations at Charlottenburg Palace. On the 200th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death in 1950, the Institute held the first chamber music concert on historic instruments. In 1962 the Institute came under the administration of the newly created Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, and the Department for Musical Acoustics was established in 1965 through a grant from the Fritz Thyssen Foundation. A ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone for the Institute's current building in 1979 on the Kulturforum, which opened to the public in 1984. Organization =Division I: Musical Instruments Museum = The Berlin Musical Instrument Museum or \\"MIM\\" collects instruments from the European art music school from the 16th to the 21st century. It holds about 3,200 instruments, of which 800 can be seen on permanent display. Those that are playable are played regularly. It is one of the most representative collections in Germany in its diversity. The museum also operates a restoration workshop and has its own concert hall with an active program of chamber concerts. =Division II: Music Theory and Music History= This department conducts large-scale research projects in the fields of Music Theory and Music History from antiquity to the present. It also operates the Institute's library with a special focus on organology and the Second Viennese School.The conceptual plan to edit the correspondence of the Second Viennese School It also manages the German National contribution to the RILM Abstract of Music Literature. Bibliographical work of the Institute is currently organized in the form of interactive database BMS online. =Division III: Acoustics and Music technology= This Department researches Recording studio technology, services the Institute's Electronic equipment, and manages the full digitization its resources. One major project captures the sounds of the historic musical instruments in the Museum systematically and them develops mathematical models to describe them. Recordings from concerts at the Museum are also part of the tasks of the Department. Digital recording studio space allows it to create high-quality master CDs in-house.

Early life and education Gong was born in Guiyang, Guizhou, on August 1, 1975. In 1992 she enrolled at the Secondary School Affiliated to China Conservatory of Music, where she studied national vocal music under Zou Wenqin. After high school, she was accepted to the China Conservatory of Music.  Songs  Her song Tante () is a fast-paced wordless fusion song, using various standard voices from Chinese opera along with imitations of traditional Chinese instruments. After Gong Linna performed this in Hunan Television's 2010 New Year concert, the song quickly spread in China as a viral video, gaining the nickname \\"Divine Comedy\\".

In 2013 she participated in the Jiangsu Television singing masterclass series All-Star Wars (). Zollitsch also participated as her sponsor. Her first performance was a rock version of a classic pop ballad based on an ancient poem, \\"Wishing We Last Forever\\", but this interpretation was considered insufficiently reverent and received the lowest score. However, her subsequent performances were very well received, including a Yunnan folk song \\"Rippling Brook\\" and an opera medley version of \\"Tante\\".

In the song's lyrics, Harrison contrasts the world of material concerns with his commitment to a spiritual path, and the conflict is further represented in the musical arrangement as the rock accompaniment alternates with sections of Indian sounds. Inspired by Gaudiya Vaishnava teacher A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the song promotes the need to recognise the illusory nature of human existence and escape the constant cycle of reincarnation, and thereby attain moksha in the Hindu faith. The contrasts presented in \\"Living in the Material World\\" inspired the Last Supper-style photograph by Ken Marcus that appeared inside the album's gatefold cover, and also designer Tom Wilkes's incorporation of Krishna-related symbolism elsewhere in the packaging. Harrison references his Beatles past as one of the trappings of the material world and refers by name to each of his three former bandmates. Ringo Starr, the Beatles' former drummer, plays drums on the track, which was recorded in England between October 1972 and February 1973. The rock portions include a slide guitar solo by Harrison, saxophone solos, two drummers, and prominent Hammond organ, while the meditative Indian interludes feature flute, tabla and a rare post-Beatle sitar contribution from Harrison. Jim Horn, Gary Wright and Zakir Hussain are among the other musicians on the recording. The production and musicianship on the track has received favourable comments from several reviewers. On release, Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone described the song as \\"an incantatory, polyrhythmic rocker with a falsetto-on-sitar refrain\\". In addition to providing the title for the Living in the Material World album, it inspired Harrison's choice for a name for his charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation, to which he donated his publishing royalties from the composition. The 2006 reissue of the album includes a film clip of \\"Living in the Material World\\", featuring archival footage of the vinyl LP's manufacturing process. Film-maker Martin Scorsese used the song's title for that of his 2011 documentary on the life of George Harrison. Background A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whose Gaudiya Vaishnavan teachings influenced the song In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison credits the influence for \\"Living in the Material World\\" to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,George Harrison, p. 258. the founder and leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.Clayson, pp. 210, 247‚Äì48. Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that \\"we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world.\\" His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation,Lambert Ramirez, \\"George Harrison: The not-so-quiet Beatle\\", philstar.com, 17 March 2014 (retrieved 11 February 2015). a point to which Shankar added: \\"He had everything ‚Äì all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to it ... because he was searching for something much higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [from a previous life].\\"Olivia Harrison, pp. 11, 244. Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to break the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation:Allison, pp. 79, 84. \\"The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out.\\"Tillery, p. 112.Chant and Be Happy, p. 18. Author Gary Tillery draws parallels between Harrison's approach to \\"[going] through the motions of living in the material world\\" and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game.Tillery, pp. 105‚Äì06. Tillery writes that \\"what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion\\" ‚Äì or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribedAllison, p. 83. ‚Äì and that \\"[w]hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality.\\"Tillery, p. 106. Speaking at a 1974 press conference,Badman, p. 136. in reply to whether there was a \\"paradox\\" between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: \\"It is difficult ... You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely and [yet] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual ... I think one by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to.\\"Anne Moore, \\"George Harrison On Tour ‚Äì Press Conference Q&A;\\", Valley Advocate, 13 November 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 16 December 2013).Steven Rosen, \\"George Harrison\\", Rock's Backpages, 2008 (subscription required; retrieved 16 December 2013). Composition As reproduced in I, Me, Mine, Harrison wrote the lyrics to \\"Living in the Material World\\" on portions of a torn-up envelope, which was previously addressed to Terry Doran at Apple Corps in central London, its postmark dated 7 November 1971.George Harrison, p. 259. The song contrasts the world of material things against spiritual concerns.Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'Living in the Material World'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 16 December 2013).Inglis, pp. 40‚Äì41. The verses describing the material world are set to rock music, over what author Simon Leng terms Harrison's \\"favourite 'Get Back' rhythm\\". The two sections describing the spiritual world serve as the song's middle eightsHuntley, p. 92. and use a more gentle melody backed by Indian instrumentation.Greene, p. 195. In Leng's view, these sections recall Harrison's 1967 composition \\"Within You Without You\\". While remarking on how Harrison's lyrics from his 1973 album Living in the Material World \\"resembled Vedic sutras\\", author Joshua Greene writes that in the song \\"Living in the Material World\\", he \\"condensed a lengthy passage from the Bhagavad Gita into a dozen simple words\\".Greene, pp. 194‚Äì95. In the opening verse, Harrison states that he \\"Can't say what I'm doing here\\" in the material world,George Harrison, p. 262. an admission that theologian Dale Allison identifies as Kafkaesque until Harrison offers \\"eschatological hope\\" with the subsequent line, \\"But I hope to see much clearer\\".Allison, p. 67. Harrison then states that he uses his body \\"like a car / Taking me both near and far\\".Tillery, p. 111. Author Ian Inglis regards this as an apt metaphor, since human bodies \\"are merely the vehicles that carry us on our journeys\\". Harrison (centre) performing with the Beatles in 1964 Harrison refers to his years as a member of the Beatles. He names his former bandmates John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo StarrDoggett, p. 207. in a verse that introduces a humorous aspect into the narrative:Rodriguez, pp. 34, 156‚Äì57. Inglis comments on Harrison's pun on the word \\"Richie\\", which can refer to the Beatles' financial success from 1963 onwards, in the sense of \\"riches\\", and to the improvements in musicianship brought about by the arrival of drummer Richard Starkey, also known as Ringo Starr, who replaced Pete Best in late 1962.Schaffner, p. 20. While noting Harrison's \\"laconic humor\\" in the song, Leng describes him as \\"still caught in the yin-yang of his Beatles identity\\", further to the various \\"instalments of 'the Beatles soap opera'\\" that Harrison provided on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass.Leng, pp. 85, 91, 130‚Äì31. In the Indian-styled middle eight, Harrison sings about his \\"sweet memories\\" of \\"the spiritual sky\\" and prays not to \\"get lost or go astray\\". Allison writes that Harrison's \\"true home\\" is in the mediative spiritual sky, since however impressive his achievements with the Beatles might be to others, they brought him no \\"meaningful contentment\\".Allison, pp. 63‚Äì64, 149. After returning to the rock-music setting, Harrison sings of his frustrations in the material world, which rather than satisfying human desires, merely leaves the senses \\"swelling like a tide\\".Allison, pp. 61, 149. Tillery writes of Harrison not being immune to \\"the siren call of the world\\" despite his spiritual goals; in his autobiography, Harrison refers to 1973‚Äì74 as \\"the naughty period\\",George Harrison, p. 274. a reaction to the failure of his marriage to Pattie Boyd.Rodriguez, p. 142. In line with teachings that Harrison had absorbed from both Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967 and the Bhagavad Gita, Allison suggests, the lines \\"Got a lot of work to do / Try to get a message through\\" demonstrate \\"a sort of prophetic self-conception\\" on the singer's part.Allison, pp. 73‚Äì74, 149. In the final verse, Harrison expresses his desire for moksha, or release from the cycle of reincarnation,Allison, pp. 64, 87. with the words: \\"I hope to get out of this place / By the Lord Sri Krsna's Grace.\\"Tillery, pp. 111‚Äì12. Inglis writes that \\"Living in the Material World\\" contrasts not only the physical with the spiritual for Harrison, but also issues such as \\"past and present, West and East, noise and calm\\".Inglis, p. 41. Leng notes the irony in the fact that although Harrison's experience with the Beatles \\"cast him into the material world\\", his exposure to Eastern philosophy came through that same experience, and thus the Beatles were \\"both his nemesis and his saviors\\".Leng, p. 131. While citing the Bhagavad Gita as a significant influence on \\"Living in the Material World\\", Allison views the \\"dualistic anthropology\\" expressed in the song as \\"central to [Harrison's] self-conception and worldview\\".Allison, pp. 25‚Äì26. Harrison himself attributed this dualism to his Pisces astrological sign,Olivia Harrison, pp. 10‚Äì11, 232. an issue he addresses in the posthumously released \\"Pisces Fish\\".Inglis, p. 119. Production =Initial recording= From mid 1971, Harrison had been largely sidetracked from his musical career for over a year, through his commitment to the humanitarian aid project that he and Shankar had initiated with the Concert for Bangladesh.Doggett, p. 192.Rodriguez, pp. 93, 137, 155. As a result, Harrison only began recording his second post-Beatles solo album, the highly anticipated follow-up to All Things Must Pass,Schaffner, p. 158. in October 1972.Leng, pp. 123, 124.Badman, p. 83. The Magic Is Here Again and The Light That Has Lighted the WorldAllison, p. 149. were each rumoured to be the title of the new albumBadman, pp. 83, 89. until Apple Records announced it as Living in the Material World.Schaffner, p. 159. Inglis views \\"Living in the Material World\\" as an ideal title track for the album, given \\"the internal dialogue in which he was engaging at the time\\".Inglis, p. 40. Leng describes Harrison as \\"a man positively pregnant with vision\\" following his achievements over the two years since the Beatles' break-up; like author Robert Rodriguez,Rodriguez, pp. 137, 139. Leng considers that a visit Harrison made to India with American musician Gary Wright, in early 1972, was a contributing factor in his artistic ambitions for the album.Leng, pp. 124‚Äì25. Harrison was keen to pare down the production after the Wall of Sound excesses employed by Phil Spector on All Things Must Pass,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 180.Rodriguez, pp. 87, 156. and chose to use a small group of backing musicians throughout the sessions.Leng, p. 125.Huntley, p. 90. Aside from himself on electric guitar, the line-up on the basic track for \\"Living in the Material World\\" was Nicky Hopkins (piano), Wright (Hammond organ), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Starr and Jim Keltner (both on drums).Spizer, p. 254. Inglis describes the music as \\"a powerful rock backing\\", while Leng views \\"Living in the Material World\\" as \\"the one time in his career that Harrison deliberately set out to create a big, showpiece rock number\\". The recording took place at the Beatles' Apple Studio, according to the album's sleeve credits,Spizer, pp. 254, 257. although Voormann maintains that Harrison's new home studio, FPSHOT, was the main location.Leng, p. 126. Harrison had intended to co-produce with Spector as before,Madinger & Easter, p. 439. but he became the album's sole producer due to Spector's unreliability.Huntley, p. 88. Session tapes, since made available unofficially on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg,Madinger & Easter, pp. 440, 441. reveal that the rock instrumentation on \\"Living in the Material World\\" continued, at a reduced volume, over the \\"spiritual sky\\" portions originally.Leng, p. 130. With Phil McDonald as recording engineer, the basic tracks for most of the album were completed by December 1972, before Hopkins departed for Jamaica to work on the Rolling Stones' new album, Goats Head Soup.Wyman, p. 415. Harrison, McDonald and Indian classical musician Zakir Hussain then produced the recording of a recent New York performance by Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, released on Apple Records in January 1973 as the double live album In Concert 1972.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 122. =Overdubbing= Work continued on Living in the Material World during January and February.Badman, p. 89. Hussain and Jim Horn were among those who made contributions to the overdubs on the title track,Kevin Howlett's liner notes, booklet accompanying Living in the Material World reissue (EMI Records, 2006; produced by Dhani & Olivia Harrison), p. 10. and Horn also played on \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\",Leng, pp. 131‚Äì32. another song directly inspired by Prabhupada.George Harrison, p. 254. Over the two \\"spiritual sky\\" sections, Hussain added tabla, replacing the rock rhythm section, while Horn played flute and Harrison played sitar. Author Alan Clayson likens Harrison's production style on Material World to that of Beatles producer George Martin and notes that \\"this moderation resulted in arrangements flexible enough for the title track to flit smoothly\\" between the contrasting rock and \\"celestial\\" Indian sections.Clayson, p. 323. The use of Indian instrumentation recalls Harrison's work with the Beatles during 1966‚Äì68, following which, Harrison admitted, he rarely played the sitar.Mitchell Glazer, \\"Growing Up at 33‚Öì: The George Harrison Interview\\", Crawdaddy, February 1977, p. 41. Adding to the pun behind the \\"Richie\\" line in the verse referencing the Beatles,Rodriguez, p. 34. Starr provides a drum fill.Madinger & Easter, p. 441. Later in the track, Horn's flute similarly acknowledges the mention of Krishna ‚Äì flute being synonymous with Krishna in the Hindu faith.Leng, p. 157fn.Tillery, pp. 67, 149. For the solos on \\"Living in the Material World\\", Harrison and Horn overdubbed slide guitar and tenor saxophone, respectively. Leng likens Harrison's soloing to the \\"passionate, rocking slide guitar\\" he supplied on \\"Edward\\" for Hopkins's The Tin Man Was a Dreamer album, also recorded at Apple in late 1972.Harold Bronson, \\"Nicky Hopkins\\", Zoo World, 25 October 1973; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 16 December 2013). The recording ends with what Clayson terms \\"a syncopated blues run-down\\", emphasising the song's \\"big production\\" status. Release and representation in album artwork Apple Records released Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973.Badman, p. 102. The title track was sequenced to end side one of the LP,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 125. and followed another Harrison composition reflecting on his years with the Beatles, \\"Who Can See It\\".Leng, pp. 129‚Äì30. In keeping with the album content,Woffinden, pp. 69‚Äì70.Tillery, pp. 111, 112. Tom Wilkes's design for the record's face labels contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world, by featuring a painting of Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna on side one and a picture of a Mercedes stretch limousine on the reverse.Spizer, pp. 256, 258.

Inner gatefold image from the Material World album, showing Harrison and his fellow musicians at a Last Supper-style banquet; photo by Ken Marcus Author Elliot Huntley views Living in the Material World as a concept album on which the material‚Äìspiritual \\"quandary\\" evident in the title track is \\"eloquently expressed\\" through the artwork's mix of religious symbolism and an inner-gatefold photograph that showed \\"[Harrison's] band indulging in a gratuitously sumptuous feast\\".Huntley, pp. 89, 90, 93. The stretch-limousine image was a detail taken from this photo, the concept for which reflected Harrison's view that the material world is not only related to money and possessions,Kevin Howlett's liner notes, booklet accompanying Living in the Material World reissue (EMI Records, 2006; produced by Dhani & Olivia Harrison), pp. 2, 4. but to \\"everything which is gross, physical, or material as opposed to the subtle, astral or casual\\", as he puts it in I, Me, Mine when discussing the song. NME critic Bob Woffinden also commented on the symbolism of this picture showing \\"Harrison with his musicians (Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner, Ringo ‚Äì the usual lot) enjoying a hearty repast, passing the no-doubt vintage wine, while in the background the longest limousine in the world awaits their convenience\\".Woffinden, pp. 70‚Äì71.

Clayson has speculated on the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo: whether the nurse with a pram, set back from and to the left of the dining table, was a reference to Boyd's inability to conceive a child; and the empty, distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison's late mother.Clayson, pp. 320, 324. Allison finds evidence of Harrison's antipathy towards organised religion in this inner-gatefold photo, following on from the lyrics to his 1970 song \\"Awaiting on You All\\".Allison, pp. 42, 136.

Critical reception In his album review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden wrote of Harrison having \\"inherited the most precious Beatle legacy ‚Äì the spiritual aura that the group accumulated\\" and suggested that he had \\"maintained its inviolability with remarkable grace\\".

Woffinden dismissed the title track as a \\"flop\\", however, citing Harrison's failed attempts \\"to elide the syllables of 'material'\\" with the melody.Woffinden, p. 71. More recently, AllMusic critic Lindsay Planer has described \\"Living in the Material World\\" as \\"one of the more profound observations to be made about the somewhat schizophrenic struggle between universal existence and monetary-driven survival\\". Planer praises the recording as \\"a testament to the artist's ability to deliver the goods [as a guitarist], with searing albeit brief interaction with saxophonist Jim Horn\\" and similarly compliments the playing of Starr and Hopkins. While opining that Material World \\"suffers from a more anonymous tract\\" next to All Things Must Pass, Zeth Lundy of PopMatters pairs \\"Living in the Material World\\" with \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" as the album's \\"most uptempo rock songs\\", which \\"fare much better [than some of the ballads] as eager bids for secession from this life, or at least from the clutches of its material concerns\\".Zeth Lundy, \\"George Harrison: Living in the Material World\\", PopMatters, 8 November 2006 (retrieved 16 December 2013).

He was born into a herder's family in Dariganga, S√ºkhbaatar, Mongolia, in 1952. Mend-Ooyo lives in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and directs the Mongolian Academy of Culture and Poetry. Mend-Ooyo is quoted saying: \\"My life is the mirror of Mongolia. I grew up in the classic nomadic way of life, then moved to the city. But even after all these years I am not a city person. All my dreams are about the countryside, and I feel like I am living in a birdcage. Now I am planning to move back to the countryside. I just hope Mongolia will too.\\"  Career  He started his career in 1970, as an elementary school teacher in the border village of Zamiin Uud, Dornogovi aimag, in the far south east of Mongolia. For ten years, from 1978, he was the editor-in-chief for the arts and cultural programmes on Mongolian State radio and television, In 1988 he became a professional writer with the Mongolian Writer's Union. After the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia, Mend-Ooyo became the Chief Project Lead and driving force behind the reconstruction of the Migjid Janraisig complex at Gandantegchinlen Monastery in Ulaanbaatar. At that time he was also a member of the Mongolian National Committee of UNESCO, and, successively, executive director, vice-president and president of the Mongolian Cultural Foundation. From 1998-2000 he sat as Chairman of the governmental Culture and Arts Agency. In 2002 he became Life member of the World Academy of Arts and Culture. In 2004 he joined the board of the Mongolian Art Council. In 2005 he founded the Mongolian culture, literature and poetry magazine GUNU, for which he also acted as the editor-in-chief. In that same year he became president of the Mongolian Academy of Culture and Poetry. In 2006 he became the President of the 26th World Congress of Poets in Mongolia. He joined in fellow residency program in Civitella Ranieri Foundation in 2014, and also led the World Poetry Days in Mongolia in 2017. In 1996, Mend-Ooyo earned a Master's degree at the University of Arts and Culture in Mongolia. In 2002, he was granted a Doctorate of Literature by the World Academy of Arts and Culture. In 2008, he became professor of Arts and Culture at the Institute of International Studies of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. In 2015, the University of Arts and Culture, Mongolia granted him Honorary doctor for his achievement in literature.  Poetry  Mend-Ooyo started writing poems at the age of thirteen. In an interview for the WSJ he explains he became interested in writing, thanks in part to Dorjiin Gombojav. D.Gombojav was a controversial poet and translator who had alienated officials in Ulaanbaatar. He was sent, as punishment, to teach at the remote rural school Mend-Ooyo attended. Mend- Ooyo related to the interviewer that he wrote his first lines of poetry under D.Gombojav's guidance. \\"He taught me the importance of Mongolian language and our traditions,\\" he says. In the late 1970s, he was one of the founder members of the underground literary group GAL (Fire). Mend-Ooyo explained that at the time, communist censors wouldn't let groups meet. \\"They were always watching us, so we had to be very careful and meet in people's homes at night.\\" The GAL group, active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, included mainly Mend-Ooyo, Ochirbatyn Dashbalbar and D.Nyams√ºren. Though GAL was \\"organised around the so-called Dariganga Three\\", others were at times involved as well. According to Simon Wickham-Smith, they \\"came to dominate the poetry scene during the subsequent ten or fifteen years, and their work is vital for a proper understanding of recent literary history in Mongolia.\\" GAL transformed during the 1980s into an \\"independent flow of literary writing called GUNU\\", whose writers \\"nowadays exercise(s) the greatest influence on Mongolian literature.\\" In the 1980s, Mend-Ooyo was allowed to publish some of his poetry after it was vetted by officials. Later, in 1988, Mend-Ooyo became a member of the Mongolian Writers' Union. In 1980, he published his first book of poetry, The Bird of Thought. Many were to follow. After the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia and the end of single-party communist rule, he started to publish more of his work, \\"including the writing that espoused his pastoral roots and eventually became his best-known poems.\\" Since his first book, he has published over twenty other books of poetry, and over a dozen novels and children's books. Altan Ovoo (Golden Hill) is an ongoing work of poetic fiction that has become one of the most influential pieces of contemporary Mongolian literature. First published in 1993, its fifth edition was published in 2010. Altan Ovoo has been translated into English by Simon Wickham-Smith in 2007. According to Wickham-Smith, Mend-Ooyo has referred to this book as his most important work. Mend-Ooyo constantly rearranges and edits \\"the elements of the narrative, to such an extent that it seems sometimes to be more an experimental novel (√† la B.S. Johnson perhaps) than a work by a romantic and deeply traditional Central Asian writer,\\" explains Wickham-Smith. Altan Ovoo has been the focus of Simon Wickham-Smith's Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Washington. He explains that \\"Mend-Ooyo's poetic novel Altan Ovoo offers a vision of nomadic literature based as much on the history and worldview of Mongol nomadic herders as on the late twentieth century Mongolia, poised between Soviet-influenced socialism and Euro-American democratic capitalism, in which it was written.\\" In his dissertation, Wickham-Smith presents \\"Altan Ovoo as a prism through which the ideas on which nomadic culture is based can be shown as being central to the self-image of Mongolia's people, both in relation to the past and to the future.\\" Gegeenten (The Holy One), published in 2012, is a modern example of the traditional Mongolian genre of namtar, non-canonical biographies of Buddhist saints intended to be read by common people. Mend-Ooyo explains that Gegeenten tells the story of the Noton Hutagt Dulduityn Danzanravjaa. It tells \\"of his realisation of, and how he expressed, the secret wisdom in the teaching and practise of the historical Buddha and his descendents.\\" The story, according to the writer, \\"also reveals how Danzanravjaa's life speaks to Mongol intellectual culture and the nomadic tradition of the Gobi area in which he lived, and how this tradition is an expression of the land and the environment in which he lived.\\" According to Maria Petrova, Gegeenten \\"can be called the first prose work, where the image of the great Gobi Noenkhutukhta (sic) and poet D.Ravzhi (sic) found artistic expression.\\" In addition to his poetry and his novels, Mend- Ooyo has also written over half a dozen research books, with topics ranging from Old Mongol script to poetry critiques, Dariganga folklore and consumer culture amongst the Mongolian nomads. Mend-Ooyo's work has been translated into over thirty languages, including English, Japanese, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Dutch, German and French. Mend-Ooyo writes his poetry by hand. He tried to write his poetry on the computer. He says of this experience: \\"It was amazing how easy and peaceful it was to erase what I had written, to begin again, to change words and to rearrange them, and to adjust the rhythm of a poem. When I had finished my poem, I printed it out. I read it. The spirit with which I had been born was missing, there was no mental engagement in it.\\" And: \\"I understood that my manuscript was the soul of my poem, the source of its spiritual power. A writer's manuscript is the calligraphy which shows the unrepeatable beating of their heart, the pathway through their warm life.\\"  Awards  Mend-Ooyo has been awarded many prizes from literary organizations around the world. Most notably, he has been named Distinguished cultural figure of Mongolia, by decree of the President of Mongolia in 1996; received the Award of the Mongolian Writers' Union in 1999; and was named Best Man of the Year 2001, and honoured as one of the nine most renowned people in Mongolia. In 2001, Mend-Ooyo was awarded the Altan Ud (Golden Feather) award, Mongolia's Writer of the Year. In 2006, the year of the 800th Anniversary of Great Mongolian Empire, Mend-Ooyo was awarded the Anniversary medal by the President of Mongolia. In 2012, Mend-Ooyo once again received the Altan Ud award, for his book Gegeenten. He received many international award and accolades, from China to England, Greece and Korea, India, Japan and the USA. In 2005, he received the Medallion of the President award of the World Academy of Arts and Culture \\"for poetic excellence\\". In that same year, he won First prize in the poetry contest of the XXV World Congress of Poets. 2006 saw him receiving a string of awards from Greece, Korean and India, in addition to the Golden Gavel Award of the World Academy of Arts and Culture, and the Golden Medal of the Literary Academy of World Peace. 2008 was also a rewarding year for Mend-Ooyo, with awards from the Crane Summit 21st Century International (Poetry) Forum and the Soka Gakkai University. In 2009, Mend-Ooyo was named Poet Laureate (with Golden Crown), the highest poetry award of the World Congress of Poets. In 2014, he was awarded the Grand Prize of the Mihai Eminescu International Festival in Craiova, Romania. In 2015 he received the Order of Chinggis Khaan, the highest honor of Mongolia, by the declaration of Mongolian President.  Poetry and cultural events  Mend-Ooyo has organized a number of poetry and cultural events in Mongolia. Most notably, he organized the XXVI World Congress of Poets in Mongolia, held in 2006. He participated in many poetry events around the world, such as the 12th Festival of World Youth and Students, Moscow, Russia in 1985; the Asian-African Young Writers Forum, New Delhi in 1987; the World Bank Conference Cultural Heritage, Florence, Italy in 1999; the Japanese-Mongolian Forum, Tokyo in 1999; the International Poetry Festival, Tokyo, Japan in 2000; the 21st, 22nd, 25th, 28th and 29th World Congress of Poets in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009; the Crane Summit 21st Century International Poetry and Culture Forum, Taipei, Taiwan in 2005; the Asian Pan-Pacific X Poetry Conference, Tokyo in 2005; the Qinghai Lake International Poetry Festival, China in 2007; the Jan Smrek International Literary Festival, Bratislava, Slovakia in 2008; the Soka Gakka International Forum, Tokyo, Japan in 2008; the Struga International Poetry Evenings, Ohrid, Macedonia in 2009; the 1st International Pen Ural Altay Conference, Istanbul, Turkey in 2009; the 60th Anniversary of R.O.C Literature and Art Festival, Taipei, Taiwan in 2010; the 7th annual Stanford Pan-Asian Music Festival, San Francisco, USA in 2011; and the 3rd Ural Altaic PEN solidarity network Congress, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in 2011. In 2014, Mend-Ooyo was artist in residence at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Umbria, Italy.  Calligraphy  While his fame is mainly based on his poetry, Mend-Ooyo has also found acclaim as a calligrapher, specialising in traditional Mongolian calligraphy. His work has been exhibited in Mongolia in the Poetry and Calligraphy exhibition in Ulaanbaatar in 2006; the 2007 Coming Time poetry and calligraphy exhibition in the Zanabazar Museum in Ulaanbaatar; the 2010 Crystal Temple of Mend-Ooyo's soul poetry and calligraphy exhibition in the Mongolian Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar, opened by the Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. In 2011, the –î—ç–ª—Ö–∏–π —ç—ç–∂ (Delhii eej: Earth Mother, Mother Earth, or World Mother) poetry and calligraphy exhibition was held in the Mongolian Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar, in collaboration with another calligrapher, D.Batt√∂m√∂r. Before setting out creating some sixty calligraphies, Batt√∂m√∂r first read two of Mend-Ooyo's (All Shining Moments and A Patch of White Mist) for inspiration. Together they choose the calligraphies they thought best expressed in calligraphic form Mend-Ooyo's verse. The poems were then written into the calligraphies in manuscript (as opposed to draw them with a brush). Afterwards, Batt√∂m√∂r and Mend-Ooyo stamped their seals on these calligraphies. This exhibition traveled to Japan in 2012, where it showed at the Kyoritsu Women's University in Tokyo. In 2012, Mend-Ooyo showed his calligraphy in The Steppe calligraphy exhibition at the Art House Center in Ulaanbaatar. Also in 2012, fourteen of his calligraphy works, curated by S.Sumiya were exhibited in the Museum Caf√© of the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands during a Mongolia Festival which was held against the backdrop of the museum exhibition Horse & Rider - From Homer to Genghis Khan. In 2014, Mend-Ooyo participated in the joint calligraphy exhibition Sky, Sun and Partnership, held at the Blue Moon Art Gallery, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of Mongolian-Japanese cultural relations. The line-up of artists included public figures such as the Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, then Mongolian Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag and the Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe. The Sky, Sun, Partnership exhibition traveled to Japan in March, 2015. Mend- Ooyo opened the exhibition, which was held at the Itochu Aoyama Art Square. Some of the exhibited pieces were to be auctioned for charity, the proceeds donated to volunteer groups to support the recovery of the area affected by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake.  Song lyrics  A writer and poet, Mend-Ooyo is also on occasion a song writer. The lyrics to the song Delhii eej (Earth Mother), first put to music by R.Enhbazar in 1985, are well known in Mongolia. Other song lyrics of Mend-Ooyo's hand are Eejiin buuveitei horvoo (World with mother's buuvei), music by R.Enhbazar, 1981; Enh ugluu (Peaceful morning), music by R.Enhbazar, 1982; Namriin ineemseglel (Smiles of autumn), music by R.Enhbazar, 1983; Malchin (Herdsmen), music by D.Batt√∂m√∂r, 1985; Aduu molor erdene (Horse is treasure), music by N.Jantsannorov, 1992; Telmen huh zereglee (Blue miracle), music by N.Jantsannorov, 1995; Altan urgiin nutag (Pastures of golden blood), music by Hatanbaatar, 2004; and Orchlon delhiidee bid jargaltai (We are happy at our Earth), music by D.Tsogdelger.  Themes in Mend-Ooyo's poetry  Mend-Ooyo's writing deals with the life of Mongolia's nomadic herders, their culture and cultural knowledge. In his style and thematic material, he seeks to express the melody and richness of the Mongol language and nomadic society. Mend-Ooyo explains his work in his short essay My Gentle Lyric \\\\- translated by S.Sumiya \\\\- thus: \\"I have long been absorbed by the fundamental nature of my nomadic ancestors, believing in them, favouring and cherishing their quiet, gentle melody. The gentle melody is the nature of my poetry. The wheels of the wooden cart which turn without harming the grass, the quiet character of the elders who avoid stepping on the flowers, the trust of the nomads who have no locks on their doors... it seems that the short road to purity lies here.\\" As the poet Ruth O'Callaghan explains in her foreword to Mend-Ooyo's book of poetry A Patch of White Mist Mend-Oyoo's poetry is rooted in his Mongolian heritage. According to O'Callaghan, Mend-Ooyo \\"engages us not only with a superb lyricism but also a profound philosophy\\" based in Buddhism. Where most people would settle for a philosophy that fits easily and neatly in this modern world, Mend-Ooyo courageously \\"continues on his quest to discover his own unique position [...] for his existence,\\" in the process crossing impossible boundaries. Mend-Ooyo's philosophy - as he words it in his poetry - is fuelled by Buddhism. Meditation stokes in him a deep empathy with the whole of creation. This profound life- long involvement with Buddhism is the source of Mend-Ooyo's strength; a strength that \\"an urgency to Mend-Ooyo's poetry in his chronicling of his pursuit of selfhood that is so lucidly and lyrically expressed.\\" Born into a herdsman's family in Dariganga, S√ºkhbaatar, Mongolia, in 1952, Mend-Ooyo grew up riding horses and tending sheep, moving over the steppe by camel caravan. Today, he leads a life very different from his childhood, moving across the world by air plane, his mobile phone constantly ringing and his office in Ulaanbaatar crowded by many Mongolian and foreign visitors. Yet, his heart remains faithful to the old ways of the steppe. Despite his achievements, Mend-Ooyo's is acutely aware that \\"to leave behind one's heritage is to court disaster.\\" O'Callaghan explains that Mend-Ooyo's poetry weaves a rich tapestry that will live long in the mind of the Western reader. Mend-Ooyo explores the intimate connection between \\"the personal and the universal.\\" He expresses himself with delicate perception and a gift for language. Western readers will be excited to find that Mend-Ooyo's poetry offers an \\"informative, introductory insight into the Mongolian psyche ‚Äì a psyche which embraces the topography not simply of Mongolia or even the universe but of the world beyond this world, an 'otherness' which travels with the poet as surely as his nomadic ancestors.\\" Simon Wickham-Smith - translator and currently a lecturer at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA - in his foreword to Mend-Ooyo's children's book Quickwit The Camel, explains Mend-Ooyo's philosophy as the expression of the \\"profound relationship between Mongolians and the landscape of their country, its physical and historical contours, its spiritual and cultural traditions and, most importantly perhaps, its visionary pathways.\\" He continues to explain that for Mongolians, their landscape is their ancestors. Especially in his book Golden Hill does Mend-Ooyo present - both in poetry and in prose - an admixture of dream, myth, cultural and social history, memoir, (auto)biography, and natural history. In an interview Simon Wickham-Smith says: \\"The idea of traditional Mongolian culture is paramount to Mend-Ooyo. He is trying to keep the nomadic spirit alive in spite of modernization\\" He adds \\"Mr. Mend-Ooyo is arguably the most important poet in Mongolia today, and certainly the one with the most presence, though some of the newer generation might say he is a bit stuck in the past.\\" In the same article for the WSJ, Bavuudorj Tsogdorj, 43 years old and an exponent of the younger generation of Mongolian poets, expresses his believe that \\"his increasingly urbanized countrymen will eventually appreciate their nomadic tradition.\\" He continues: \\"Younger poets are now writing with European thoughts and styles, but they will come back to Mongolian poetry and thoughts someday. At that time Mend- Ooyo will be really valuable.\\" He adds: \\"Mend-Ooyo is Mongolia's poetry representative ‚Äî he is a genuine nomadic poet.\\" Today, Mend-Ooyo puts his energy into rethinking the modern Mongolian way of life. In an interview he explains that \\"he envisions a 21st-century nomadic community in which schools, health care and markets move with the people, allowing them to maintain their mobility while providing some of the benefits of contemporary society.\\" As he says it: \\"It's my dream to build it.\\" And: \\"The reason nomads come to the cities is to get education for their children, hospital access. We want to allow nomads to be more modern, to use cellphones and Internet. Keep the old life, just make it better.\\"  Opinions and Comments  \\"Mend-Ooyo is an artist, full of good deeds, spreading the best of Mongolian culture and customs to the public nationally and internationally as his fame echoes not only across Mongolia but also beyond our borders.\\" > Mongolian President Elbegdorj Tsakhia's speech at the order of Chinghis > Khaan award ceremony. 2015.11.12 \\"Gombojav dispune de darul medita≈£iei versulsƒÉu st·∫≠rne≈üte cititorul, il pune pe ganduri, transmitandu-i propriile trairi passionale, intr-o comuniune intima cu elementele primordial ale naturii, cu insasi viata, intr-un registru lucid, calm, dar profubd emotional.\\" > Anthologia poeziei universal de astazi, Editura EUROPA Craiova, Romania. > 2014 \\"It is a poetry that starts from a concrete fact and transforms into a timeless art.

This present never happens in a linear time even if it seems so. It opens a path in space, makes the immensity navigable.

He wrote, \\"In this time of confusion, how heavy is the poet's burden! And when I read the first poem in this book, \\"Connective Meaning,\\" I had the thought that Mend-Oyoo has found indeed what the poet might in fact be able to do in our current time of confusion. So the poet and his poetic works are clearly revealing the inner world of human qualities. The poetry leads us back to the source. And thus we consider clearly the difference between intention and reality. It for sure is this poet's bright and undying world which is manifest in us.\\" > Dr Shi Chao-yin. Louvain University, Belgium, 2007 \\"G Mend-Ooyo's poetry has developed through his investigation of viewpoint and is able to express life through the simplicity of his language.

Harrison wrote the song in 1970, midway through the recording sessions for All Things Must Pass, and recorded it in Los Angeles the following year while organising the Concert for Bangladesh. The composition was inspired by the deteriorating condition of his mother, Louise, before she succumbed to cancer in July 1970, and by Harrison's feelings of helplessness as he visited her in hospital in the north of England. Given the subject matter, \\"Deep Blue\\" also served to convey the suffering endured by the millions of refugees from war-torn Bangladesh in 1971, as sickness and disease became widespread among their makeshift camps in northern India. Following Harrison's work with American guitarist David Bromberg, \\"Deep Blue\\" features sparse instrumentation in the folk-blues style. It includes one of Harrison's first uses of dobro on a recording. The song proved popular on US radio and was listed with the A-side when \\"Bangla Desh\\" peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Well regarded by music critics and commentators, \\"Deep Blue\\" was out of print since the 1980s and gained a reputation as an overlooked B-side. The re-release came in September 2006, when EMI included the song as a bonus track on the reissue of Harrison's Living in the Material World album.  Background and inspiration  George Harrison's inspiration for writing \\"Deep Blue\\" was the fatal illness of his mother, Louise. The youngest of her four children,Tillery, p. 7. Harrison often credited his mother with encouraging his music career from a young age, and a sense of individuality generally.Olivia Harrison, p. 49.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 21, 23. Although a practising Catholic,Clayson, p. 20.Allison, p. 17. she instilled in all her children the importance of spirituality over religion, a trait that was influential in Harrison's embracing of Hinduism in 1966.Doggett, p. 22. Louise was also diligent in replying to her son's fan mailGreene, pp. 41, 155.Clayson, p. 177. and, in the words of music journalist John Harris, she \\"stood alone among the Beatle parents as an active champion of their talents\\".Harris, p. 72. Harrison discussed the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine, during which he recalls that his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 40. After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her;O'Dell, pp. 90, 96‚Äì97. author Peter Doggett comments that, because of the severity of this news, Harrison would later have no recollection of how he heard of John Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.Doggett, pp. 101, 103. Although Louise's cancer had gone into remission,Tillery, p. 87. it returned in the spring of 1970.Greene, pp. 156, 178. Exhausted from nursing her, Harrison's father, Harry, was then also hospitalised.Greene, p. 178. As a result, their youngest son was \\"running back and forth\\" between Warrington and London while trying to record his first post-Beatles solo album, All Things Must Pass.Clayson, p. 289. Adding to the strain, Harrison would also tell Musician, he was having to assure each of his parents that the other one was okay.Clayson, p. 319. On 4 July, the day that his song \\"Something\\" won an Ivor Novello award,Tillery, p. 161. Harrison put his solo album on hold and drove north to see Louise for the last time.Badman, p. 12. In his Musician interview, Harrison says that he wrote \\"Deep Blue\\" \\"at home one exhausted morning\\" during this period.  Composition  Musically, the song is in the folk-blues style.Leng, p. 114. Author Simon Leng notes \\"Deep Blue\\" as a comparatively rare foray into the genre for Harrison, along with \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\",Leng, pp. 114, 127. a song he wrote in early 1971 in response to Paul McCartney's lawsuit to dissolve the Beatles' partnership.Doggett, p. 157. Leng attributes the folk-blues influence primarily to Bob Dylan and American roots guitarist David Bromberg, the latter of whom Harrison had met in New York, through Dylan, shortly before beginning work on All Things Must Pass.Leng, pp. 73‚Äì74, 114. Another Harrison biographer, Ian Inglis, writes that the style of \\"Deep Blue\\"'s \\"easy, unpretentious melody\\" is equally influenced by the Lovin' Spoonful. Harrison recalled the mix of major and minor chords as reflecting the \\"frustration and gloom\\" he experienced while visiting his mother in the cancer ward.Huntley, p. 74. In what Inglis describes as a \\"poignant contrast\\" with the composer's Beatles track \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", Harrison sings that the sunshine brings him no relief,Inglis, p. 33. but instead leaves him \\"suffering in the darkness\\", which is \\"so easy come by on the roadside of one long lifetime\\".George Harrison, p. 211. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison says of the mood he captured in the song: \\"it's that smell and the whole atmosphere of doom that's in those hospitals.\\"George Harrison, p. 212. The lyrics bear out the powerlessness he felt while someone dear to him died, specifically in the second verse: Harrison was at Louise's bedside until her death on 7 July.Tillery, pp. 79, 161. According to Rolling Stone contributor Mikal Gilmore, he read passages to her from a text about the Bhagavad Gita, \\"commenting on the sacred book's views of death as a changeover rather than a termination\\". In \\"Deep Blue\\"'s final verse, Harrison's lyrics likewise focus on spirituality:Allison, pp. 90, 140. Harrison was alone with his mother at the end, author Joshua Greene writes, and when she began to slip into unconsciousness, he \\"put down the book and began chanting softly into her ear\\". Inglis views the lyrics to \\"Deep Blue\\" as exemplifying Harrison's \\"fondness for family\\".Inglis, p. 141. Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife at the time, recalls that Louise had withheld the seriousness of her condition from him for eight weeks before September 1969, \\"in case George was busy\\" with his career, and that, following her death, Harrison was anxious about how his father would manage alone.Boyd, pp. 133, 134. Keen to strengthen the familial bond, Harrison invited his brothers Harold and Pete to live on his Friar Park estate in Oxfordshire,Greene, pp. 178‚Äì79. along with their father.  Recording  Within a year of Louise Harrison's death, Harry was staying in Los Angeles with Harrison and Boyd,Boyd, p. 134.O'Dell, p. 192. while Harrison worked with Ravi Shankar on the soundtrack to the film Raga.Harvey Kubernik, \\"With a Little Help from His Friends: George Harrison and the Concert for Bangla Desh\\", Rock's Backpages Archive, July 2011 (subscription required; retrieved 24 August 2014). A Bengali Hindu, Shankar was distraught at the news of the humanitarian disaster then occurring in East Pakistan,Clayson, pp. 307‚Äì08. following the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War in March 1971.Lavezzoli, p. 187.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 123. After fleeing the war zone in their homeland, an estimated 7 millionSchaffner, p. 146. refugees were being accommodated in inadequate camps in India, where diseases such as cholera had become rife.Greene, pp. 185‚Äì86.Liner notes, The Concert for Bangladesh CD booklet (Sony BMG, 2005; produced by George Harrison & Phil Spector), pp. 6‚Äì7. Shankar later recalled that Harrison was deeply moved by his request for help in aiding the Bengali refugees,Olivia Harrison, p. 286.Shankar, p. 219. as a result of which he committed to staging the Concert for Bangladesh in New York that summer.Huntley, pp. 72‚Äì73.Rodriguez, pp. 43, 48. Author Elliot Huntley suggests that, having been incapable of assuaging his mother's pain as she lay dying in 1970, Harrison gained extra motivation from \\"a situation his fame and commercial cache could do something to alleviate\\".Huntley, pp. 73‚Äì74. As a B-side for the hastily written \\"Bangla Desh\\",Madinger & Easter, p. 434. which he composed to bring attention to the cause,Neal Alpert, \\"George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh\\", Gadfly Online, 3 December 2001 (retrieved 24 August 2014). Harrison chose to record \\"Deep Blue\\".George Harrison, pp. 212, 220. In the Bangladesh context of 1971, author Bruce Spizer writes, the song made a suitable, \\"intimately chilling\\" companion to the hard-charging lead track.Spizer, p. 236. Harrison recorded \\"Deep Blue\\" in Los Angeles, at the Record Plant West on 4‚Äì5 July,Badman, p. 38. while organising the benefit concerts to be held at New York's Madison Square Garden on 1 August.Leng, pp. 111‚Äì12, 113.Clayson, p. 308. In contrast with the extravagant sound normally associated with co-producer Phil Spector's work,Schaffner, pp. 142, 147. \\"Deep Blue\\" received a sparse musical arrangement.Leng, pp. 113‚Äì14. Underpinned by Jim Keltner's kick drum, the recording features three distinctive guitar parts, all performed by Harrison ‚Äì two finger-picked acoustic guitars, along with fills played on a dobro. Leng cites Bromberg's influence again in Harrison's acoustic guitar playing on the track and considers the American guitarist to have been Harrison's inspiration for adopting the dobro,Leng, pp. 108, 113‚Äì14. the two musicians having recently collaborated on \\"The Holdup\\" for Bromberg's debut solo album.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 111.Inglis, pp. 33‚Äì34. The dobro had since become \\"something of a party piece for him\\", Leng writes, as \\"Deep Blue\\" preceded 1971 releases by John Lennon, Gary Wright and Billy Preston that each featured Harrison \\"cameos\\" on the instrument.Leng, pp. 108‚Äì09. The only other musician on the session for \\"Deep Blue\\", bassist Klaus Voormann, recalls that he, Harry Harrison and Memphis producer Don Nix then travelled to Nashville and explored the American South,Leng, pp. 113, 114. before heading to New York for the concert rehearsals.James Sullivan, \\"George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh Featured Drug Trouble for Eric Clapton, Stage Fright for Bob Dylan\\", Spinner, 1 August 2011 (archived version retrieved 12 October 2013).Harris, p. 74. \\"Deep Blue\\" appeared on Harrison's initial setlist at the rehearsals,Olivia Harrison, p. 288. but was not performed at either of the two Concert for Bangladesh shows.Madinger & Easter, pp. 436‚Äì37.  Release  Trade ad for the \\"Bangla Desh\\" single, August 1971 Apple Records issued the \\"Bangla Desh\\" / \\"Deep Blue\\" single on 28 July 1971 in the United States (as Apple 1836) and 30 July in Britain (R 5912).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 103. Before then, Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, had manufactured one- sided promo discs, featuring just \\"Bangla Desh\\", with the result that the lead side had already received considerable airplay in the build-up to the concerts.Clayson, p. 312. The release was accompanied by a trade advertisement that reflected the emotion conveyed in \\"Deep Blue\\", of someone watching a loved one \\"waste away\\", Spizer writes; in this case, the image depicted a mother attempting to comfort her starving child.Spizer, pp. 234, 236. The B-side was a popular track in its own right at the time of release. In his 1987 feature on Harrison, in Musician, music journalist Timothy White described the song as having been \\"a jukebox favorite in bars in the [United] States\\".Timothy White, \\"George Harrison ‚Äì Reconsidered\\", Musician, November 1987, p. 55. By 11 September, when the single reached its peak position on America's Billboard Hot 100,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 352. at number 23,\\"George Harrison: Awards\\" (\\"Billboard Singles\\"), AllMusic (archived version retrieved 15 October 2017). radio programmers had opted for \\"Deep Blue\\" and the entry appeared as a double A-side in the chart listings. The single enjoyed more success on the other two US national charts, peaking at number 20 on Cash Box and number 13 on Record World.Spizer, p. 235. In a chart compiled by Poland's Music Clubs' Co-Ordination Council, \\"Deep Blue\\" was listed at number 1 in December 1971, just ahead of \\"Bangla Desh\\".\\"Billboard Hits of the World\\", Billboard, 4 December 1971, p. 54 (retrieved 8 August 2016).  Reissue  The 1971 single remained the only official release for \\"Deep Blue\\" for over 30 years,Madinger & Easter, p. 435. during which the song was largely forgotten. In his conversations with Derek Taylor over 1978‚Äì79 for I, Me, Mine, Harrison acknowledged that the track had become \\"a bit obscure\\".George Harrison, pp. 64, 212. Inglis suggests that its exclusion from any album releases was because the lyrics' \\"raw imagery\\" confined the track to a \\"very specific personal and political relevance\\" within the Bangladesh context. After the expiration of Harrison's contract with Capitol in 1976, this and other non- album B-sides were among the notable omissions from The Best of George Harrison,Rodriguez, pp. 126, 128. a compilation that ignored many popular songs from his solo career in favour of an LP side of Beatles tracks.Huntley, p. 151.Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \\"George Harrison The Best of George Harrison\\", AllMusic (retrieved 23 August 2014). That same year, Harrison signed with Warner Bros. Records,Badman, pp. 194, 197. whose staff producer Ted Templeman expressed his admiration for \\"Deep Blue\\".Mick Brown, \\"A Conversation With George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979 (retrieved 2 August 2016). As a result, Harrison wrote a song in the same musical style, the more upbeat \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\", for his 1979 album George Harrison.George Harrison, p. 352.Rodriguez, pp. 175, 177. From the mid 1990s, \\"Deep Blue\\" became available on Harrison bootleg compilations such as Pirate Songs and Through Many Years.Madinger & Easter, pp. 435, 442. Along with \\"Miss O'Dell\\", a song he wrote in Los Angeles partly about the Bangladesh crisis,Clayson, p. 317.Len Comaratta, \\"Dusting 'Em Off: George Harrison and Friends ‚Äì The Concert For Bangladesh\\", Consequence of Sound, 29 December 2012 (archived version retrieved 22 August 2014). it was finally given an official CD release in September 2006,Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", Mojo, November 2006, p. 124. as a bonus track on Harrison's remastered Living in the Material World album.John Metzger, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 25 July 2014). \\"Deep Blue\\" also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968‚Äì75 reissue of the album.Joe Marchese, \\"Review: The George Harrison Remasters ‚Äì 'The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975'\\", The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 27 September 2014).  Reception  \\"Deep Blue\\" impressed the notably anti-Harrison\\"George Harrison biography\\", rollingstone.com (retrieved 26 July 2014). Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who considered the song on a par with \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord\\", while noting its status as a track \\"hidden away\\" on a B-side.Robert Christgau, \\"Consumer Guide Reviews: George Harrison\\" (\\"Thirty- Three & 1/3\\"), robertchristgau.com (retrieved 15 October 2017). In their 2000 book on the four ex-Beatles' solo recordings, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter wrote of \\"Deep Blue\\": \\"The track's understated instrumentation and perceptive lyrical content make this one of the best, yet most overlooked songs in George's catalog.\\" In a 2001 appraisal of Harrison's Apple recordings, for Record Collector, Peter Doggett opined that Harrison had \\"tucked away an acoustic gem\\" on the B-side to \\"Bangla Desh\\" and described the song as \\"a sad but still buoyant lament inspired by his regular visits to his dying mother's bedside\\".Peter Doggett, \\"The Apple Years\\", Record Collector, April 2001, p. 37. Among reviews of the Living in the Material World reissue, John Metzger of The Music Box describes \\"Deep Blue\\" as a \\"loose, swinging acoustic blues\\". Writing for AllMusic, Bruce Eder views it as an \\"important bonus track\\", as well as \\"a fantastic showcase\\" for Harrison's acoustic guitar playing.Bruce Eder, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World (Bonus Tracks/DVD)\\", AllMusic (retrieved 4 October 2014). In a review of the Apple Years reissues, New Zealand Herald music critic Graham Reid describes the song as an \\"especially good\\" B-side.Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). Theologian Dale Allison recognises \\"Deep Blue\\" as Harrison's \\"musically beautiful and lyrically moving\\" response to his mother's death, a \\"prayer to God for help, light, love, and understanding in the midst of personal grief\\".Allison, p. 140. Ian Inglis praises the song's \\"uncluttered production and economical backing\\", adding: \\"'Deep Blue' is unlike anything he had written or recorded at that time, and its relative obscurity is undeserved.\\"Inglis, p. 34, 45. While comparing the song favourably with better-known compositions by Lennon (\\"Julia\\") and McCartney (\\"Yesterday\\", \\"Let It Be\\"), Inglis concludes: \\"Where they differ is that Harrison's song is about himself as much as it is about his mother; her death is a starting point for an exploration of the 'suffering' and 'darkness' that afflict us all.\\"Inglis, p. 34. Elliot Huntley describes it as \\"a plaintive acoustic guitar tune\\" that became an \\"unjustly overlooked B-side\\". Simon Leng sees \\"Deep Blue\\" as a candidate for what he terms \\"the 'last great B-side' accolade\\", rivalling Harrison's Beatles tracks \\"The Inner Light\\" and \\"Old Brown Shoe\\". Leng also considers it to be a \\"worthy companion\\" to Dylan's New Morning album and the work of Bromberg and Ry Cooder.

Like Leon Russell's \\"Pisces Apple Lady\\", it was inspired by Chris O'Dell, a former Apple employee, and variously assistant and facilitator to musical acts such as the Beatles, Derek & the Dominos, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Santana. Harrison wrote the song in Los Angeles in April 1971 while waiting for O'Dell to pay him a visit at his rented home. As well as reflecting her failure to keep the appointment, the lyrics provide a light-hearted insight into the Los Angeles music scene and comment on the growing crisis in East Pakistan that led Harrison to stage the Concert for Bangladesh in August that year. Harrison recorded \\"Miss O'Dell\\" in England between October 1972 and February 1973, during the sessions for his Living in the Material World album. The arrangement reflects the influence of Dylan, and the recording is notable for Harrison breaking into laughter midway through the verses. A popular B-side, \\"Miss O'Dell\\" was unavailable officially for over 30 years after this initial release, until its inclusion as a bonus track on the 2006 reissue of Material World. An alternate, laughter-free vocal take of the song circulates on Harrison bootleg CDs and was included on the DVD accompanying the deluxe edition of Living in the Material World in 2006. O'Dell named her 2009 autobiography after the song. Background and composition After arriving in London from Los Angeles in mid May 1968, to start work at the Beatles' Apple Corps headquarters at the invitation of her friend Derek Taylor,O'Dell, pp. 15, 17. Chris O'Dell began a career that saw her become, in author Philip Norman's words, \\"the ultimate insider\\" in rock-music circles.Philip Norman, dust-jacket quote in O'Dell. In the space of two years, O'Dell witnessed first-hand a series of key moments in rock 'n' roll: she joined in the backing chorus on the song \\"Hey Jude\\"; she was on the Apple rooftop in January 1969 when the Beatles played live for the last time; she personally delivered the harmonicas for Bob Dylan's comeback performance at the Isle of Wight; and on the day Paul McCartney announced he was leaving the Beatles, she was there at George Harrison's Friar Park mansion when Harrison and John Lennon met to discuss the news.O'Dell, pp. 54‚Äì56, 74‚Äì77, 155. Later in the 1970s, O'Dell went on to work with the Rolling Stones, during the LA sessions for Exile on Main St. (1972) and their subsequent \\"STP\\" US tour, and on Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's 1974 reunion tour and Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975, but said her time with the Stones, she says, felt like a \\"climb down the ladder\\".O'Dell, p. 214. Similarly, after working for Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd during their first few months at Friar Park, from March to June 1970, she would always view the Henley estate as a spiritual home,O'Dell, pp. 188, 233. and the Harrisons as her most important friends in the fickle world of the music business.O'Dell, pp. 161, 162, 185, 188, 193, 214. O'Dell assisted Harrison in preparing for the recording sessions for All Things Must Pass (1970), helped him recruit musicians for the Bangladesh benefit concerts, served on his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, and was privy to the details that ended the Harrisons' marriage as well as that of Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey.O'Dell, pp. 156, 172‚Äì73, 196‚Äì98, 257‚Äì66, 302, 305‚Äì06. By April 1971, O'Dell was back in California, working with former Apple Records A&R; manager Peter Asher on developing the careers of singer-songwriters such as James Taylor, Carole King and Linda Ronstadt.O'Dell, pp. 182‚Äì83. At the same time, Harrison, having recently contributed to the debut solo album by Bobby Whitlock, formerly of Derek & the Dominos, and finished the Radha Krishna Temple (London) albumLeng, p. 123.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 101. ‚Äì both acts that O'Dell had been involved with professionally in 1969‚Äì70 ‚Äì was now in Los Angeles to begin work on Shankar's Raga film soundtrack.Lavezzoli, p. 187. He had also been informed of the tragic events occurring in Shankar's homeland, following the Bhola cyclone and the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War.Leng, p. 111.O'Dell, p. 189. This was an issue that Harrison dealt with in the opening verse of a song he began writing, \\"Miss O'Dell\\",Len Comaratta, \\"Dusting 'Em Off: George Harrison and Friends ‚Äì The Concert For Bangladesh\\", Consequence of Sound, 29 December 2012 (archived version retrieved 15 August 2014). while waiting for his eponymous friend to visit him at his rented Malibu home:Harrison, p. 248.Clayson, p. 317. Adopting a considerably more lighthearted approach than would be the case in his \\"storming, urgent\\" song \\"Bangla Desh\\" a couple of months later,Leng, p. 113. these lines refer to international donations of rice, which \\"somehow\\" ended up becoming the property of the Indian Government instead and either being sold in government shops in India, or getting exported back to the West to be sold in Indian shops there.Harrison, p. 220. (\\"Very strange,\\" he concludes in his autobiography.) His disenchantment with the Californian surroundings and O'Dell's failure to turn up as arrangedO'Dell, pp. 186‚Äì88. are reflected in the next lines:Leng, p. 136. In verse two, Harrison describes the ocean-front house, the balcony of which stretched out over the waves below: Inside the house, neither he nor his driver Ben could get the record player to work, and Harrison admits to his absent friend over the song's middle eight: \\"I can tell you, nothing new / Has happened since I last saw you.\\" In her 2009 memoir, O'Dell explains that her escalating drug habit had been responsible for her non-attendance on the evening in question, as well as a reluctance to have to put up with scores of hangers-on around the ex-Beatle.O'Dell, p. 186. In the song's third verse, however, Harrison shows that he too had no interest in the typical trappings of the LA music scene: O'Dell eventually drove up the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu and found him, in keeping with the song's \\"I'm the only one down here\\" refrain, alone and feeling \\"pretty lonely\\". After joking to her \\"I'm going to make you famous\\", Harrison played the new song, about which O'Dell would later write: \\"I heard George sing 'Miss O'Dell' many times in the years to come, but it would never sound as good as it did that night with the waves breaking and the breeze blowing through the room ...\\"O'Dell, p. 191. Recording Following the completion of the Rolling Stones' North American tour in late July 1972,Wyman, p. 398. a \\"[d]ead tired and strung out\\" O'Dell visited Friar Park and found Harrison \\"happy\\" and enthusiasticO'Dell, p. 234. about the music he would soon record for his much- anticipated follow-up to All Things Must Pass.Schaffner, p. 159. \\"I remember thinking that this was the old George\\", O'Dell later wrote, \\"the fun, light, mischievous George I remembered from my first days at Apple, almost as if the Bangladesh concert had released him from the woes of the past.\\" The same good humour is evident in the performance of \\"Miss O'Dell\\",Inglis, pp. 43, 44. which Harrison recorded during the Living in the Material World album sessions, beginning in early October.Badman, p. 83. Musical biographer Simon Leng describes the performance as Harrison in \\"'Apple Scruffs' busking mode\\", referring to his Dylan-influenced 1970 tribute song to the Beatles' diehard fans known as Apple scruffs.Leng, pp. 94, 136. In early January 1973, Dylan was another guest at Friar Park, along with his wife Sara Lownds.Sounes, p. 272. The couple had temporarily escaped a chaotic location shoot in Durango, Mexico, where Dylan was starring in the Sam Peckinpah western Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.Heylin, pp. 342‚Äì44. On the recording of \\"Miss O'Dell\\", Harrison plays acoustic guitar and harmonicas, backed by just the rhythm section of Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner.Inglis, p. 43. With its unusually sparse backing, on which Keltner's cowbell is a prominent feature, the released version of \\"Miss O'Dell\\" is notable for the three occasions when Harrison bursts into laughter midway through the verses.Spizer, p. 250.Huntley, p. 95. Among the music industry in-jokes contained in the lyrics,Clayson, p. 322. Harrison concludes the song by leaving a phone number ‚Äì that of Paul McCartney's old home in Liverpool.Madinger & Easter, p. 442. The two former Beatles were still not on good terms following the band's break-up in April 1970,Doggett, pp. 180, 193. and Harrison's gesture was an example of him \\"pok[ing] fun\\" at McCartney, author Bruce Spizer writes.Spizer, pp. 250, 256. Another example was Harrison's adoption of a similar logo to Wings' for his fictitious \\"Jim Keltner Fan Club\\" banner, on the back of the Material World album cover.Rodriguez, p. 81.Spizer, pp. 158, 256. Harrison recorded a \\"straight\\" vocal on the same backing track, a version that is available unofficially on bootlegs such as Living in the Alternate World and Pirate Songs. Release Trade ad for the \\"Give Me Love\\" single, May 1973 Apple Records released \\"Miss O'Dell\\" as the B-side of Living in the Material Worlds lead single, \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\",Badman, p. 99. on 7 May 1973 in America and 25 May in Britain.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 125. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that the song was considered for inclusion on the album also, in its non-laughing vocal take; an alleged early alternative to the LP's side-one track order omitted the album opener, \\"Give Me Love\\", and had \\"Miss O'Dell\\" closing the side.Madinger & Easter, p. 440. As with the majority of the songs on Living in the Material World,Schaffner, p. 160. the copyright for \\"Miss O'Dell\\" was assigned to the Material World Charitable Foundation.Harrison, p. 385. Harrison established the foundation in April 1973,Badman, p. 98. partly to support charitable causes,Book accompanying Collaborations box set by Ravi Shankar and George Harrison (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by Olivia Harrison; package design by Drew Lorimer & Olivia Harrison), p. 32. and as a means to avoid the government and legal interference that had resulted in the withholding of funds raised for the Bangladeshi refugees over 1971‚Äì72.Clayson, pp. 315‚Äì16.Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", CIrcus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).\\"At the Starting Gate\\", Contra Band Music, 21 August 2012 (retrieved 22 October 2013). =Reissue= Having become a sought-after rarity for over 30 years, \\"Miss O'Dell\\" was finally given a second release when included as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster of Living in the Material World.\\"George Harrison Living in the Material World (Bonus Tracks)\\" > Tracks, AllMusic (retrieved 4 June 2013).Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", Mojo, November 2006, p. 124. The \\"straight\\"-vocal take of the song was issued at this time as well, set to archival footage and included on the deluxe-edition, CD/DVD version of the album.John Metzger, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 4 June 2013). \\"Miss O'Dell\\" also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968‚Äì75 reissue of Material World.Kory Grow, \\"George Harrison's First Six Studio Albums to Get Lavish Reissues\\", rollingstone.com, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014). The DVD exclusive to the Apple Years box set similarly includes the film clip originally issued in 2006.Joe Marchese, \\"Give Me Love: George Harrison‚Äôs 'Apple Years' Are Collected On New Box Set\\", The Second Disc, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014). Reception Writing for AllMusic, Bruce Eder considers \\"Miss O'Dell\\" to be an \\"important bonus track\\" on the remastered Living in the Material World CD, as well as \\"an exuberant and richly produced, light-hearted number\\".Bruce Eder, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World (Bonus Tracks/DVD)\\", AllMusic (retrieved 4 October 2014). In another review of the 2006 reissue, for the Vintage Rock website, Shawn Perry viewed the inclusion of \\"Miss O'Dell\\" as \\"unremarkable yet special enough to thrill the hardcore fans\\". Perry described the film accompanying the alternative take as \\"a still photo slideshow of Harrison and his pals eating, drinking, and frolicking on the grounds of what may or may not be Friar Park, the former Beatle's estate\\", and admired the bonus DVD as perhaps the \\"pi√®ce de r√©sistance\\" of the deluxe edition of Material World.Shawn Perry, \\"George Harrison, Living In The Material World ‚Äì CD Review\\", vintagerock.com, October 2006 (retrieved 29 November 2014). The song has traditionally received a warm reception from Beatles biographers. Simon Leng describes it as a \\"jaunty, Dylanesque flip side\\", a \\"short musical postcard\\" from an ex-Beatle \\"[sent] off to rock star exile in Los Angeles\\" and obviously bored with what he finds there. Bruce Spizer views it a \\"delightful throw-away song perfect for a B-side\\", while to Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, less impressed with the Material World album, \\"Miss O'Dell\\" is a \\"great track, full of the humor so desperately missing from the rest of the LP\\". Theologian Dale Allison describes it as \\"enigmatic\\", a \\"biting expos√©\\" of Harrison's own celebrity status, reflecting the same \\"ennui\\" that would later inspire his Traveling Wilburys song \\"Heading for the Light\\".Allison, p. 116. Like Madinger and Easter, Ian Inglis welcomes the \\"spontaneous fun\\" evident in this \\"impromptu\\" recording, compared with Harrison's more \\"solemn\\" 1973 album, and recognises the influence of both Basement Tapes-era Bob Dylan & the Band as well as Lonnie Donegan's mid-1950s brand of skiffle.Inglis, p. 44. Inglis describes the song as Harrison's \\"playful and lighthearted tribute\\" to his and O'Dell's friendship and groups the track within a subcategory of Harrison compositions that \\"express his fondness\\" for family and friends.Inglis, pp. 43, 141. Other examples include \\"Behind That Locked Door\\", written to Dylan; \\"Deep Blue\\", mourning the death of his mother; and \\"Unknown Delight\\", written shortly after the birth of his son, Dhani Harrison.Inglis, pp. 26‚Äì27, 33‚Äì34, 82, 141.

In a career that lasted from June 1797 to April 1798 he ran at least twice and won once. On his racecourse debut in the summer of 1797 he won The Derby. He was unplaced on his only other confirmed race. Background The Fidget Colt was a brown horse bred by his owner the 5th Duke of Bedford. Until 1913 there was no requirement for British racehorses to be named, and in the late eighteenth century it was common for horses to be known by their owner, colour, sex and pedigree rather than by an official name. The Duke of Bedford's previous Derby winner had been known as \\"the Florizel colt\\" or \\"the Brother to Fidget\\" during his three-year-old season, but was later given the name Eager. The Fidget Colt, however, was never given an official name: he was known only as \\"the Fidget colt\\" or \\"the colt by Fidget\\". The colt's dam, an unnamed mare by Highflyer was a half- sister to the notable broodmare Young Giantess, who produced the Derby winner Eleanor and was the grand-dam of two others in Phantom and Priam. Fidget was not a particularly important stallion: in the year of the Derby winner's birth Fidget was standing at Woburn in Bedfordshire at a fee of three guineas, making him the cheapest of the four stallions at the stud. Racing career =1797: three-year-old season= On 2 June 1797 The Fidget Colt made his racecourse debut in the Derby at Epsom. Running as \\"D. of Bedford's br c by Fidget out of a sister to Pharamond\\" he started at odds of 10/1 in a field of seven runners, with Sir Frank Standish's Sir Peter colt (later named Stamford) sent off the 11/8 favourite. Ridden by John Singleton, Jr., he won from the 20/1 outsider Escalus with Plaistow third and the favourite fourth. =1798: four-year-old season= On 11 April \\"D. of Bedford's c. by Fidget out of Caelia's dam\\" reappeared after a break of ten months at Newmarket Racecourse in the third class of the Oatlands Stakes. He carried a weight of 102 pounds in the handicap race over the two mile \\"Ditch In\\" course and finished seventh behind the 1796 St Leger winner Ambrosio. Pedigree *The Fidget Colt was inbred 3 x 3 to Herod and Matchem, meaning that both of these stallions appear twice in the third generation of his pedigree. The Fidget Colt therefore had only two great-grandfathers, instead of the usual four. Also, he was inbred 4 x 4 to Tartar and Cade due to them being the sires of the 3 x 3 inbreeding scenario.

It was also the B-side of the album's second single ‚Äì which was \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\" in North America and most other territories, and \\"Dark Horse\\" in Britain and some European countries. Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, the track is the first of only two genuine instrumentals he released from 1970 onwards ‚Äì the other being the Grammy Award-winning \\"Marwa Blues\\", from his 2002 album Brainwashed. Harrison recorded \\"Hari's on Tour\\" in April 1974 at a spontaneous session held at his home, Friar Park. A slide guitar-based composition, the track also features saxophonist Tom Scott and the latter's jazz-rock band L.A. Express, who were touring as Joni Mitchell's backing group at the time. It was the first Harrison song to feature Scott, who became a regular collaborator and served as band leader during Harrison's only series of concerts in North America, the highly publicised \\"Dark Horse Tour\\" with Ravi Shankar. \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\" was played as the opening number throughout this tour, over November and December 1974. Although music critics and Harrison biographers have generally viewed the album track in an unfavourable light, several concert reviewers identified it as an effective opener for the shows. \\"Hari's on Tour\\" is one of only two songs from the 1974 tour to have been released officially, after a live version was included on the limited-edition Songs by George Harrison 2 EP in 1992. This live recording was taken from the Washington, DC stop on the tour, during which Harrison met with President Gerald Ford at the White House. Background George Harrison first worked with jazz saxophonist, flautist and arranger Tom Scott in April 1973,Badman, p. 94. during the Los Angeles sessions for Ravi Shankar's Shankar Family & Friends album.Leng, p. 138.Rodriguez, p. 237. The two musicians also contributed to Ringo Starr's album Ringo around that time, as well as Cheech & Chong's Los Cochinos.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 199‚Äì200, 211‚Äì12.Rodriguez, pp. 228, 266. Outside of his session work, Scott's main activities were leading his band, L.A. Express,Clayson, p. 335. and backing Joni Mitchell, both live and in the studio.David Rensin, \\"Tom Scott: Joni's Spark\\", Rolling Stone, 1 August 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).Romanowski & George-Warren, p. 877. Just as Harrison had long combined elements of Hindustani classical music with Western rock and gospel, and was now moving towards the funk and soul genres,Leng, pp. 59‚Äì60, 83‚Äì85, 96, 153, 156‚Äì57. Scott's solo work fused jazz, funk, pop and Middle Eastern influences.Alex Henderson, \\"Tom Scott Tom Scott & the L.A. Express\\", AllMusic (retrieved 19 December 2012). His collaborations with Mitchell also coincided with her move from confessional folk songwriting towards pop and jazz,\\"Joni Mitchell biography\\", rollingstone.com (retrieved 22 May 2015). and eventually avant garde.Romanowski & George-Warren, p. 672.Jason Ankeny, \\"Joni Mitchell\\", AllMusic (retrieved 19 December 2012). Harrison, Scott and Mitchell soon developed a mutual rapport, according to L.A. Express bassist Max Bennett.Leng, p. 149. In addition to carrying out further sessions for Shankar Family & Friends in Los Angeles, in March 1974,Doggett, p. 217. Harrison had begun spending time there trying to set up his own record label,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 223. with the winding down of the Beatles' Apple Records from mid 1973 onwards.Madinger & Easter, pp. 441, 442.Clayson, pp. 320‚Äì21. In August 1973, rumours in the music industry claimed that Harrison, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Paul Simon were forming a label together;Badman, p. 106. in fact, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records, one of the first releases of which was the Shankar album,Madinger & Easter, p. 442. and Dylan temporarily signed with David Geffen's Asylum Records, which was Mitchell's label.Sounes, pp. 273, 276. Composition and recording Mitchell's tour in support of her critically acclaimed Court and Spark albumJason Ankeny, \\"Joni Mitchell Court and Spark\\", AllMusic (retrieved 19 December 2012). arrived in London in April 1974.Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", Circus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 28 September 2014). While backstage at her and Scott's show at the New Victoria Theatre, Harrison invited the five members of the L.A. Express to come out to his Oxfordshire home, Friar Park, the following day. Bennett recalls that they arrived by limousine and he mistook the property's grand gatehouse for the main residence. Scott later told music journalist Michael Gross that only a social visit was planned, but the band were impressed with Friar Park's 16-track home studio, FPSHOT, and Harrison suggested they record something. The first song they worked on was an untitled instrumental tune that later became known as \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\", for which Scott made a lead sheet for the band. Part of the title was taken from \\"Hari Georgeson\\", the latest pseudonym adopted by Harrison when working with non-EMI/Capitol artists,Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 200‚Äì08. since he was still contracted to Apple until January 1976.Schaffner, pp. 179, 188.Doggett, pp. 224, 240. Harrison played slide guitar on the track, in his preferred open E tuning,Clayson, p. 279. adopting a similar sound to the one he had used three years earlier on John Lennon's song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" Aside from Scott and Bennett's contributions, on saxophone and bass, respectively, the other musicians were Robben Ford (electric guitar), Roger Kellaway (piano) and John Guerin (drums).Madinger & Easter, p. 443. Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, writes that the tune predominantly uses major chords, with the \\"main melodic interest\\" coming with a shift to C# minor seventh, which provides \\"a moment of softening sweetness\\".Leng, p. 150. Leng notes the contrast between Harrison's Fender Stratocaster \\"roaring into action\\" on this song and the \\"opulence\\" of his previous album, Living in the Material World, and suggests that Harrison now \\"just wanted to be one of the boys\\" in a \\"working, rocking band\\". The engineer at the session was Phil McDonald.Album credits, Dark Horse CD (Capitol Records, 1992; produced by George Harrison). Tom Scott (pictured at a Beatles fan convention in 2013) According to Scott, the basic track took \\"a couple of hours\\" before they had a satisfactory take. The musicians then recorded a second song, \\"Simply Shady\\", which, like \\"Hari's on Tour\\", would be included on Harrison's forthcoming album, Dark Horse.Spizer, p. 264. The five band members stayed over at Friar Park before Ford, Bennett, Kellaway and Guerin left for Denver the following day. Scott says he stayed on and worked further with Harrison at FPSHOT; in addition to the various horn parts, he played organ on \\"Hari's on Tour\\".\\"George's original [inner] sleeve design for the album\\", Dark Horse (2014 reissue) CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 9. In the same interview with Gross, for Circus Raves magazine, Scott recalled that he was the first Western musician that Harrison approached about joining him and Shankar for a tour of the United States and Canada later in the year. The tour would be the first in North America by a former Beatle since the group's 1966 US visit,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44. and Harrison's first live performances since his staging of the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971.Lavezzoli, pp. 192‚Äì93.Tillery, pp. 113‚Äì14, 162‚Äì63. Rather than include Beatles material on the 1974 tour, however,Woffinden, p. 83.David Cavanagh, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse\\", Uncut, August 2008, p. 43. Harrison planned to present a varied program combining rock, soul/R&B;, jazz, funk and Indian classical music.Leng, pp. 170, 172, 174. Eight Arms to Hold You authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\" was written \\"simply as a show opener\\" for the North American concerts, which would also feature Harrison's former Apple Records prot√©g√© Billy Preston.Rodriguez, pp. 72‚Äì74. Although his 1969 experimental album Electronic Sound consists of Moog synthesizer sounds and the 1968 Wonderwall Music soundtrack is almost entirely devoid of vocals,Inglis, pp. 17, 20.Leng, p. 50. out of all the tracks released by Harrison as a solo artist after the Beatles' break-up in 1970, \\"Hari's on Tour\\" is a rare example of a genuine instrumental composition.Inglis, p. 44. Only 2002's \\"Marwa Blues\\" stands as another.Leng, p. 299.Inglis, pp. 120‚Äì21. Among other projects they worked on together through to the early 1980s, Harrison played on the instrumental \\"Appolonia (Foxtrata)\\", from Scott's 1975 album New York Connection,Badman, pp. 163‚Äì64. and Scott helped produce Harrison's debut on Dark Horse Records, Thirty Three & 1/3.Madinger & Easter, p. 453. North American tour and album release Harrison's overcommittal of his time to Dark Horse acts Ravi Shankar and Splinter during 1974 resulted in him having to rush-record much of Dark Horse while preparing for the North American tour.Harrison, p. 312.Madinger & Easter, pp. 442‚Äì43. Due to the pressure, Harrison developed laryngitis during rehearsals and damaged his voice.Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison: Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 72.Leng, pp. 147‚Äì48, 166. As well as placing further importance on the instrumentals in his setlist,Clayson, p. 338.Peter Doggett, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years\\", Record Collector, April 2001, p. 39. which included \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\" and Scott's track \\"Tom Cat\\",Huntley, pp. 115, 116. Harrison's depleted vocals marred the concerts for many observers.Tillery, p. 114.Rodriguez, p. 58. In addition, while many critics admired the adventurousness of the musical program and reviewed the shows favourably,Leng, pp. 160‚Äì65, 174. others, particularly in music publications such as Rolling Stone,Rodriguez, p. 59.Clayson, pp. 338‚Äì40, 342. wrote scathingly of Harrison's reluctance to acknowledge the Beatles' legacy, together with his willingness to share the spotlight so readily with Shankar's orchestra of classical musicians and Preston.Woffinden, pp. 83‚Äì84. In his role as band leader, Scott spoke out in support of Harrison's musical direction and refuted reports that the tour was not going well; instead, he told Circus Raves, audience reaction had been \\"radically different from city to city\\" and dependent on whether concertgoers chose to listen, or came expecting to hear the Beatles. Harrison played \\"Hari's on Tour\\" as the opening song throughout the tour,Madinger & Easter, p. 447. which began on 2 November 1974 in Vancouver and ended in New York City on 20 December.Badman, pp. 137‚Äì38.Lavezzoli, p. 196. It was preceded by a recording of Monty Python's \\"The Lumberjack Song\\", played through the concert PA while the band took the stage.Madinger & Easter, p. 446.Leng, p. 185. As the many bootlegs from the tour reveal, early on in each performance of \\"Hari's on Tour\\", Harrison often called out a greeting to the city or town in question.Clayson, pp. 338, 342.\\"George Harrison Bootleg Discography ‚Äì Live\\", Hari's on The Web (retrieved 19 December 2012). Some concert reviewers referred to the song as \\"Hari Good Boy Express\\" or \\"Hari Good Bye Express\\".The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 126. The first of these two titles is how Harrison named the track on the preliminary artwork included in the 2014 reissue of Dark Horse. The studio version appeared as the opening track on Dark Horse, followed by \\"Simply Shady\\".Spizer, pp. 263‚Äì64. Due to the delay in its completion, the album was released on 9 December in North America, towards the end of the Harrison‚ÄìShankar tour,Madinger & Easter, pp. 443, 635.Spizer, p. 263. and a few days before Christmas in Britain.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 144.Badman, p. 145. Although Christmas shows in the UK had been under consideration, no such performances took place, and Harrison's only tour after 1974 would be a series of Japanese concerts in December 1991 with Eric Clapton.Rodriguez, p. 60.Tillery, pp. 136‚Äì37, 166. Following its initial release, \\"Hari's on Tour\\" was issued as the B-side to the second single off the album ‚Äì \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\" in the United States, Canada and a number of other territories, and \\"Dark Horse\\" in Britain and some other European countries.Madinger & Easter, pp. 632, 633.Badman, pp. 146, 152. Reception Contrasting with his successes as a solo artist since 1970,Paul Du Noyer, \\"George Harrison: An Obituary\\", Blender, February‚ÄìMarch 2002. Dark Horse earned Harrison the worst critical notices of his career.Greene, p. 213. \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\" drew a favourable response during the 1974 tour, however, as reviewers commented on the energy with which the band performed the piece.Leng, pp. 161, 164, 165. In his feature article on the West Coast concerts, for Rolling Stone, Ben Fong- Torres described the song as a \\"well-arranged, tension-and-release number\\", while the Pacific Sun called it \\"a zingy and classically melodic instrumental ... a touchstone of the Harrison style\\".Leng, p. 161. Reviewing the second show of the tour, D.P. Bond of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: \\"Harrison's opening instrumental piece was beautiful: the fullest, finest explosion of rock 'n' roll that I think I have ever heard.\\"Leng, p. 160. The NMEs Bob Woffinden wrote a notably unfavourable assessment of the Dark Horse album,John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 82. in which he found \\"Hari's on Tour\\" to be \\"an unevenly paced boogie thing that has George blowing most of his licks straightaway and Tom Scott coming on with a few quasi-Jnr. Walker bursts\\". Woffinden continued: \\"Which, you feel, would not be a bad appetiser for the real meat to follow. Unfortunately, Hari's vegetarian.\\"Bob Woffinden, \\"George Harrison: Dark Horse\\", NME, 21 December 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 28 September 2014). In an equally unfavourable review of the album,Huntley, pp. 112‚Äì13.Leng, pp. 174, 175. Jim Miller of Rolling Stone dismissed the track as \\"banal\\".Jim Miller, \\"Dark Horse: Transcendental Mediocrity\\", Rolling Stone, 13 February 1975, pp. 75‚Äì76. Harrison biographer Alan Clayson refers to Hari's on Tour\\" as \\"an instrumental that went in one ear and out the other\\",Clayson, p. 342. while in The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described it as sounding like \\"a backing track from which the vocal line has mysteriously been deleted\\".Carr & Tyler, p. 115. Author Elliot Huntley acknowledges that the musicians \\"performed brilliantly\\" on the recording, but adds, \\"unfortunately brilliant musicians alone do not a good song make\\".Huntley, p. 109. Echoing the magazine's earlier support for the tour, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker praised Harrison's \\"nifty slide guitar\\" on the opening song and throughout the album, which he felt \\"should certainly do a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation\\".Brian Harrigan, \\"Harrison: Eastern Promise\\", Melody Maker, 21 December 1974, p. 36.Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 95. In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner similarly opined that \\"Hari's on Tour\\" \\"boasts some mean licks\\" while commenting that neither the tour nor the album \\"warrant[ed] all the abuse they got\\".Schaffner, pp. 177, 178‚Äì79. Writing more recently for AllMusic, Richard Ginell describes the recording as \\"Tom Scott's L.A. Express churning out all- pro L.A.-studio jazz/rock\\" and adds that the song \\"gets the doomed project off to a spirited start\\".Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison Dark Horse\\", AllMusic (retrieved 24 May 2015). Simon Leng views this \\"neat instrumental\\" as a collaborative effort between Harrison and Scott, and a logical step for the guitarist, given Harrison's early appreciation of Chet Atkins' instrumentals. Leng regrets Harrison's apparent abandoning of his \\"meticulous approach\\" to recording in favour of uncharacteristic spontaneity, and concludes: \\"Ultimately, this good-time guitar showcase is as relevant as Dylan's 'Nashville Skyline Rag'.\\"Leng, pp. 148‚Äì49, 150. Ian Inglis writes of Scott's soprano sax producing an \\"atmosphere of anticipation\\" similar to a successful film or television theme, and identifies \\"Hari's on Tour\\" as an indication that Harrison, some years before his career became focused on movie production, was able to \\"effectively incorporate the conventions of a soundtrack within the codes of rock\\". Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Dark Horse, Joe Marchese of The Second Disc describes the track as \\"a bright opening to an album that would considerably darken in tone\\".Joe Marchese, \\"Review: The George Harrison Remasters ‚Äì 'The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975'\\", The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 28 September 2014).

The song addresses Harrison's wayward behaviour during the final year of his marriage to Pattie Boyd, particularly the allure of temptations such as alcohol and drugs over spiritual goals. Harrison said the song was about \\"what happens to naughty boys in the music business\\". Harrison wrote \\"Simply Shady\\" in Bombay in early 1974 during his first visit to India since 1968, when he and his Beatles bandmates had studied Transcendental Meditation at Rishikesh. In his lyrics, he reflects on the karmic consequences of his lifestyle in England and references John Lennon's \\"Sexy Sadie\\", a song inspired by the Beatles' time in Rishikesh. Harrison recorded the track at an impromptu session held at his Friar Park home studio with the L.A. Express, who were touring Britain as Joni Mitchell's backing band at the time. Two of the musicians, Tom Scott and Robben Ford, subsequently played with Harrison on his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar. Harrison's vocals on the track were marred by his contracting laryngitis towards the end of the sessions for Dark Horse ‚Äì a result of his having overextended himself on business and musical commitments, as well as his punishing lifestyle. Partly due to Harrison's hoarse singing, \\"Simply Shady\\" has been viewed in an unfavourable light by many music critics and reviewers. Other commentators consider its confessional tone to be significant in Harrison's career, representing a departure from the spiritual certainties that typically defined his work following the Beatles. Background and inspiration Bombay's Victoria Terminus (pictured in the 1950s). During his stay in Bombay in 1974, Harrison drew inspiration from his troubled personal life when writing \\"Simply Shady\\". According to George Harrison's recollection in his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, the visit he made to India in 1974 was his first since 1968,George Harrison, p. 57. when the Beatles had studied Transcendental Meditation at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh.Lavezzoli, pp. 180, 184.Harry, p. 62. The main purpose of the 1974 trip was to attend a Vedic ceremony in honour of Ravi Shankar's new home in Benares and to film the event.Wright, p. 119. Accompanied by his friend and fellow musician Gary Wright, Harrison first went to Calcutta in early January before travelling to Benares;Wright, pp. 119, 120. there, he and Shankar formulated the concept for Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from IndiaOlivia Harrison, pp. 258, 302. and an ensuing joint tour of North America at the end of the year.Leng, p. 148.Shankar, p. 223. Harrison and Shankar then travelled to the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan,Leng, p. 157. where Harrison was inspired to write the devotional song \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\".Rodriguez, p. 384. Later in the trip, while in Bombay, he wrote another new composition, \\"Simply Shady\\".George Harrison, p. 282. In a 1994 interview held at Shankar's home in California,Shankar, p. 309. Harrison spoke of the reluctance he used to feel before visiting India or meeting with friends such as A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the Hare Krishna movement, due to the \\"craziness\\" taking place in his life as a rock musician.George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD, Village Roadshow, 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese), disc 2; event occurs between 14:38 and 15:35. Written during a period when his marriage to Pattie Boyd was ending,Greene, p. 209.Doggett, pp. 208‚Äì09. \\"Simply Shady\\" was inspired by the decadent lifestyle that Harrison had been leading at his Friar Park home in England.Rodriguez, pp. 382‚Äì83.Leng, pp. 165, 184. Over this period, he had immersed himself in his work, while returning to the worldly ways he had mostly abandoned in 1967, following his embrace of Indian philosophy, particularly meditation.Tillery, pp. 53‚Äì54, 116.Carol Clerk, \\"George Harrison 1943‚Äì2001\\", Uncut, January 2002, pp. 46, 55; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Boyd has written of their overindulgence with drugs and alcohol over 1973‚Äì74 and highlighted Harrison's excessive use of cocaine, about which she says: \\"I think it changed him ... it froze George's emotions and hardened his heart.\\"Boyd, pp. 175‚Äì76. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison describes the song as being \\"about what happens to naughty boys in the music business\\".Allison, p. 154. While recognising a disparity between its subject matter and his surroundings at the time, he says he most likely came up with the theme before leaving for India. Composition \\"Simply Shady\\" is in 4/4 time and its musical key is C minor.\\"Simply Shady\\", in George Harrison Dark Horse: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1974). The song comprises three combinations of verse and chorus,George Harrison, pp. 286‚Äì87. followed by repeated choruses. Author Simon Leng defines its musical style as country rock. The lyrics to the song serve as a confession in which Harrison details how he has lost his way. Author Ian Inglis describes \\"Simply Shady\\" as an autobiographical account of a musician \\"who succumbs to the temptations of 'sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll' that are stereotypically linked with the mythology of rock\\".Inglis, p. 44. Leng likens the track to contemporary work by Neil Young, particularly \\"Yonder Stands the Sinner\\", adding that Harrison arrives at \\"the same impasse\\" as the Canadian singer: \\"decadence, dependency, and despair\\".Leng, p. 150. In the opening verse,George Harrison, p. 286. Harrison acknowledges the changes brought about by his overindulgence with drugs and alcohol.Allison, p. 100. He recalls partaking from \\"the juicer\\", after which his \\"senses took a dip\\" and he became \\"blinded by desire\\".Allison, pp. 63‚Äì64, 100. During the second verse, he likens his increased cravings to a form of madness.Allison, pp. 62, 120. In the lyrics to the chorus, he recognises the futility of this behaviour, knowing that, just as \\"it's all been done before\\", it provides nothing beyond relief in the short term.Inglis, pp. 44‚Äì45. Harrison measures the consequences of his actions in terms of their karmic effect,Allison, pp. 86‚Äì87, 129. a preoccupation he had first embraced in his songwriting over 1966‚Äì67 with songs such as \\"Art of Dying\\".Inglis, pp. 31, 45. In the third verse,George Harrison, p. 287. he acknowledges that all thoughts and deeds affect the world, since \\"A pebble in the ocean must cause some kind of stir\\".Allison, pp. 86‚Äì87. Recognising his culpability, Harrison concludes: \\"The action that I've started sometime I'll have to face / My influence in motion rebounding back through space.\\"Inglis, p. 45. In their respective commentaries on \\"Simply Shady\\", Christian theologian Dale Allison cites Harrison's indictment of his behaviour in the context of karmic retribution as evidence of the composition offering \\"religious interest\\", while Inglis highlights an important contrast between Harrison's lack of moralising in the song relative to the sermonising quality of his 1973 album Living in the Material World. The song's final choruses include the line \\"You may think of Sexy Sadie, let her in through your front door\\", reprising the late-period Beatles device of self-reference.MacDonald, p. 275.Leng, p. 85. In this case, Harrison name-checks \\"Sexy Sadie\\",Leng, p. 151. John Lennon's thinly veiled attack on the MaharishiWoffinden, p. 4. and the latter's alleged sexual advances towards one of the female students at the Rishikesh retreat.MacDonald, p. 262.Lewisohn, p. 144. Inglis views this mention in \\"Simply Shady\\" as significant on three levels: Harrison is alluding to a casual sexual partner in the present; recalling his former mentor and guru, the Maharishi; and supplying \\"a coded reference\\" to his past as a Beatle.Inglis, pp. 11, 45. Production =Initial recording= Harrison returned to England in March 1974Greene, p. 211. and recorded \\"Simply Shady\\" the following month for his new album, Dark Horse. Unlike his two previous studio albums, All Things Must Pass and Material World, Harrison worked on Dark Horse in stages, over a year-long period.Leng, pp. 147‚Äì48. During this time, he focused instead on projects such as setting up Dark Horse RecordsThe Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44.Huntley, pp. 105‚Äì08. and producing albums by the record label's first two signings: Shankar's Shankar Family & Friends, and The Place I Love by the group Splinter.Rodriguez, pp. 197‚Äì98.Olivia Harrison, p. 312. Leng cites the recording of \\"Simply Shady\\" ‚Äì an impromptu session with the L.A. Express, who were touring the UK as Joni Mitchell's backing group ‚Äì as an example of the unpredictable approach that Harrison adopted when making Dark Horse.Leng, pp. 148‚Äì49. Robben Ford (pictured in 2007) played lead guitar on the track, with Harrison, and subsequently joined his tour band for the North American tour with Ravi Shankar. Harrison had collaborated with Tom Scott, the leader and saxophonist of the L.A. Express,Michael G. Nastos, \\"L.A. Express\\", AllMusic (retrieved 3 August 2016). during the Shankar Family & Friends sessions in Los Angeles in 1973.Kevin Howlett's liner notes, Dark Horse CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 3. After attending Mitchell's show at the New Victoria Theatre in London, he invited the band to record at his home studio, FPSHOT, the following day.Leng, p. 149. Lead guitarist Robben Ford recalls that on arrival at Friar Park, at 1 pm, the musicians were entertained by Boyd until Harrison woke up, at which point the couple \\"didn't interact and she just disappeared\\". The recording session began at 1 am. \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\" ‚Äì an instrumental that Harrison used as the opening song of both Dark Horse and his live shows with ShankarHuntley, p. 109. ‚Äì was recorded on the same day.Spizer, p. 264. The recording engineer at the session was Phil McDonald.Inner sleeve credits, Dark Horse LP (Apple Records, 1974; produced by George Harrison). Leng describes \\"Simply Shady\\" as a \\"stark-sounding cut\\" due to the unpolished production. The track has a blues-based arrangement, for which Ford and Roger Kellaway supplied the main instrumental fills, on guitar and piano, respectively.Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", Circus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Bassist Max Bennett recalled that he enjoyed the visit, which included a tour of Harrison's Friar Park estate, but did not feel they had \\"accomplished much musically\\". The band then went back to London to continue their tour with Mitchell in support of her album Court and Spark. =Overdubbing= Scott returned to Friar Park to work further with Harrison in August,Madinger & Easter, pp. 442, 443. by which time Boyd had left him for his friend Eric Clapton.Tillery, p. 94. Scott overdubbed a variety of horn parts on \\"Simply Shady\\", while Harrison played the closing guitar solo ‚Äì a part that Inglis views as \\"straining\\" and in keeping with the song's \\"emotional plea\\".Inglis, p. 44. Both Scott and Ford later played in Harrison's tour band.Rodriguez, p. 60.Nick DeRiso, \\"Gimme Five: Gary Wright, Robben Ford, Bobby Whitlock, Alan White, Joey Molland on George Harrison\\", Something Else!, 25 February 2014 (archived version retrieved 14 July 2016). Described by author Robert Rodriguez as \\"a Tom Waits croak\\",Rodriguez, p. 382. Harrison's singing on \\"Simply Shady\\" was affected by laryngitis, like many of the tracks on Dark Horse.Leng, pp. 148, 151.

Reflecting the contrast between the songs on side one of the LP and the more optimistic themes on side two,Woffinden, pp. 84‚Äì85. the record's face labels included a photo of Harrison on the first side and one of his new girlfriend, Olivia Arias, who worked at Dark Horse Records' Los Angeles office,Tillery, pp. 115‚Äì16. on the reverse.Spizer, pp. 265, 268. The majority of reviews for Dark Horse were unfavourableSchaffner, p. 178. and, in Leng's description, \\"Simply Shady\\" was \\"much maligned\\".Leng, pp. 150‚Äì51. Recalling the release in 2001, Record Collector editor Peter Doggett paired the song with \\"Dark Horse\\" as the two tracks that most alienated Harrison's fans due to the ravaged quality of his singing.Peter Doggett, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years\\", Record Collector, April 2001, p. 39. In addition, as a chronicle of its author's self-degradation, \\"Simply Shady\\" marked a departure from the standard subject matter of Harrison's solo work. According to Leng, the song \\"shatter[ed] the 'Beatle George' image\\" and so proved unwelcome amid the high expectations surrounding the concurrent tour, which was the first in North America by a former Beatle since the band's 1966 tour.Leng, pp. 151, 166. In Rolling Stones highly unfavourable critique of Dark Horse,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 46.Huntley, pp. 112, 114. Jim Miller condemned Harrison for showing disdain towards the Beatles' legacy during the tour and then releasing an album on which his voice was blown.Jim Miller, \\"Dark Horse: Transcendental Mediocrity\\", Rolling Stone, 13 February 1975, pp. 75‚Äì76.Leng, p. 174. Writing in Circus Raves, Michael Gross defended Harrison's new direction and highlighted the reference to \\"Sexy Sadie\\" as the artist \\"look[ing] askance\\" at his past. In the NME, Bob Woffinden denigrated \\"Simply Shady\\" as \\"[evincing] all the faults that clog the album\\". Woffinden continued: \\"George's vocals are tiresome, his voice, nasal and toneless, seems to be slowing down the song; the lyrics are straightforward and dull. Also the familiar cloying punches that Harrison's own production pulls are evident. Nothing ever happens ‚Äì the sound is dense, viscid ...\\"Bob Woffinden, \\"George Harrison: Dark Horse\\", NME, 21 December 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). In an otherwise favourable review, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker praised the musicianship of Harrison and the L.A. Express, and Harrison's singing on the album, but said that the song \\"really drags on\\".Brian Harrigan, \\"Harrison: Eastern Promise\\", Melody Maker, 21 December 1974, p. 36.Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 95. Retrospective assessment and legacy The Lake Palace hotel in Udaipur. According to Olivia Harrison (n√©e Arias), a tape exists of Harrison recording a demo of \\"Simply Shady\\" there in 1974. In a 1979 interview with Rolling Stone, Harrison cited \\"Simply Shady\\" as the song that best summed up a fallow period in his personal life that ended when he found lasting happiness with Arias. Arias has commented on the surprising background to the song, saying, \\"He's in India, a very spiritual place, writing about a very material experience\\", adding that a tape has been discovered of Harrison working on the composition while at the Lake Palace hotel in Udaipur. She told Mojo of this period in Harrison's career: \\"Everything in his life had changed at that point: getting divorced, Apple was in turmoil, he had his own personal demons. '74 was one of those breaking-through-the-sound-barrier periods. You come through and it's just quiet on the other side.\\"Michael Simmons, \\"Cry for a Shadow\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 84. Among Beatles biographers, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter write that, as the first vocal track on Dark Horse, \\"Simply Shady\\" \\"bring[s] the LP to a screeching halt\\", and they describe it as \\"Somnambulistic in tone and tempo\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 443. Elliot Huntley offers a positive view, enjoying the song's \\"pleasant melody\\" and its \\"continuation of the West Coast feel that commenced the album\\". Alan Clayson considers that \\"Simply Shady\\" would have benefited from a sparser musical arrangement, but he recognises an element of intrigue in Dark Horse, with Harrison revealed as \\"an ex-Beatle in uncertain transition\\".Clayson, pp. 343, 345. New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid similarly deems the track to be \\"More interesting than exceptional\\", as an account of how Harrison \\"soaked himself in booze and whatever\\" in reaction to the disintegration of his marriage.Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 15 July 2016). Among other recent reviews, Scott Elingburg of PopMatters considers Dark Horse to be an album on which \\"Harrison is playing music like he has nothing to lose and all the world to gain\\", and he cites \\"Simply Shady\\" as one of two tracks that \\"experiment subtly with tone, mood, and, most surprisingly, darkness\\".Scott Elingburg, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975\\", PopMatters, 30 January 2015 (retrieved 15 July 2016). Writing in Classic Rock, Paul Trynka highlights the song among the \\"beautiful, small-scale moments\\" that were overlooked at the time of the album's release, describing it as \\"a shamefaced confessional on the banality of drunkenness\\".Paul Trynka, \\"George Harrison The Apple Years 1968‚Äì75\\", Classic Rock, November 2014, p. 105. Like Simon Leng, Robert Rodriguez identifies the subject matter as highly unusual among Harrison's work up to 1974, and he includes \\"Simply Shady\\" on his list of the artist's most underrated songs from the 1970s.Rodriguez, pp. 379, 382. While labelling the track a Lennon-style \\"self-flagellation\\", Rodriguez praises the musicianship on the recording and the musical arrangement, and considers that Harrison's \\"detached delivery proves to be just as chilling in its own way as [Lennon's] typical emotional approach was\\".Rodriguez, p. 383.

Category:Songs about alcohol Category:Songs about drugs ","title":"Simply Shady"},{"id":"34610156","text":"\\"MƒÅya Love\\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1974 album Dark Horse. The song originated as a slide guitar tune, to which Harrison later added lyrics relating to the illusory nature of love ‚Äì maya being a Sanskrit term for \\"illusion\\", or \\"that which is not\\". Harrison's biographers consider the lyrical theme to be reflective of his failed marriage to Pattie Boyd, who left him for his friend Eric Clapton shortly before the words were written. Harrison recorded the song at his home, Friar Park, on the eve of his North American tour with Ravi Shankar, which took place in November and December 1974. The recording features Harrison's slide guitar extensively and contributions from four musicians who formed the nucleus of his tour band: Billy Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. Reviewers note the track as an example of its parent album's more diverse musical genres, namely funk and rhythm and blues, compared with the more traditional rock orientation of Harrison's earlier solo work. Harrison played \\"MƒÅya Love\\" throughout his 1974 tour, although no live recording has ever been officially released. The song later appeared as the B-side of Harrison's second single off his 1975 album Extra Texture, \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\", which was the final release by Apple Records in its original incarnation. Background and composition In his single sentence discussing \\"MƒÅya Love\\" in I, Me, Mine, his 1980 autobiography, George Harrison states that he wrote the song \\"purely as a slide guitar tune with the words added later\\".Harrison, p. 270. His handwritten lyrics for the song include mention of open E tuning,Harrison, p. 271. Harrison's preferred alternative tuningClayson, p. 279. and one he used for his other slide guitar compositions during the first half of the 1970s, such as \\"Woman Don't You Cry for Me\\", \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" and \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\".Harrison, p. 234. Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, likens \\"MƒÅya Love\\" to \\"Woman Don't You Cry for Me\\" and the 1987 song \\"Cloud 9\\", in that they all feature lyrics that were \\"appended out of necessity\\" rather than created through genuine inspiration.Leng, p. 247. In this case, the \\"perfunctory\\" lyricsClayson, p. 336. consist of a series of comparisons between the illusory nature of love and that of all things in the material world,Allison, pp. 64‚Äì65. in line with the basic Hindu concept that everything in life is maya.Tillery, pp. 106‚Äì07. Theologian Dale Allison writes that Harrison had \\"anticipated\\" such an interpretation of the world in his lyrics to the Beatles song \\"Within You, Without You\\" in 1967 ‚Äì specifically when referring to people who \\"hide themselves behind a wall of illusion\\".Allison, p. 64. The first explicit mention of maya in a Harrison composition appears in \\"Beware of Darkness\\",Leng, p. 93. released on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass.Schaffner, p. 142. Harrison biographers such as Allison and Ian Inglis interpret his concept of maya love in this 1974 song as reflecting the failure of his marriage to Pattie Boyd, rather than a comment on love and human relationships in general.Allison, pp. 65, 150. However, Eric Clapton has spoken of Harrison's view that relationships were, like possessions, all maya.Eric Clapton interview, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD (Warner Strategic Marketing, 2003; directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese). During an interview with Houston radio station KLOL, shortly before the song's release in December that year, Harrison elaborated on the concept: \\"Maya love is something when it's 'I love you if, 'I love you when, 'I love you but. It's a type of love that comes and goes which we do tend to give to one another ...\\"\\"Hari's On Tour (Depressed)\\", Contra Band Music, 17 October 2012 (retrieved 18 August 2014). In the first verse of \\"MƒÅya Love\\", Harrison compares such \\"unreal\\" love to the flow of the ocean: Subsequent verses equate illusory love with the passing of each day (\\"First it comes, then it rolls away\\"), the wind (which is \\"Blowing hard on everything\\") and rainfall (which Harrison describes as \\"Beating on your window brain\\").Inglis, p. 46. Allison writes of these comparisons: \\"All this presumably stands in contrast to God's love, which doesn't come and go, which never gives way to night, and which heals rather than harms.\\" The final verse states: \\"MƒÅya love is like a stream / Flowing through this cosmic dream.\\"Harrison, p. 272. Allison views this analogy as a reference to all things in the material world being \\"nothing more than God's dream\\".Allison, p. 65. The same life-as-a-dream metaphor appears in later Harrison compositions, Allison suggests, particularly \\"Unknown Delight\\", written about the birth of his and second wife Olivia Arias's son Dhani, and \\"Dream Away\\", Harrison's theme song for the HandMade movie Time Bandits (1981). Musically the song combines Harrison's blues-based riffsHuntley, p. 110. with elements of funk, a genre that he was increasingly drawn towards during this period via his enduring passion for R&B; and soul.Leng, p. 153. Leng also observes that \\"MƒÅya Love\\" is another instalment in its composer's \\"long line of three-syllable chants\\", following on from songs such as \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Give Me Love\\".Leng, p. 153fn. Recording Despite having a highly publicised North American tour to prepare for ‚Äì the first solo tour there by an ex-BeatleSchaffner, p. 176. ‚Äì as well as a new album to record beforehand,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44. Harrison dedicated much of September and early October 1974 to organising Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India.Madinger & Easter, p. 442. Harrison sponsored this concert revue, via his Material World Charitable Foundation, and produced a studio album for later release on his Dark Horse record label.Lavezzoli, p. 195. Prior to this project, in late August through to the start of September, \\"MƒÅya Love\\" was among four tracks rush-recorded at FPSHOT, Harrison's home studio in Henley- on-Thames, Oxfordshire,Spizer, p. 264. for inclusion on his album, also called Dark Horse.Greene, pp. 211‚Äì12. Apart from Billy Preston, Harrison's old friend and former Apple Records prot√©g√©,Rodriguez, pp. 72‚Äì73. the musicians at the sessions were relatively new to Harrison:Madinger & Easter, p. 443. saxophonist and L.A. Express band leader Tom Scott, and the much-admired rhythm section of Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark.Leng, p. 152. These four musicians, all American, provided the nucleus of Harrison's tour bandLeng, p. 167. and lent his new music a contemporary edge.Rodriguez, p. 169. In addition to his guitar parts, Harrison contributed percussion to the recording, as \\"P. Roducer\\",Sample album credits, Dark Horse (2014 reissue) CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison). one of his favoured pseudonyms over 1973‚Äì75.Schaffner, p. 179. The recording begins with Preston's \\"skittering\\" Fender Rhodes piano, which displays the influence of Ray Charles, Preston's former mentor.Clayson, pp. 250‚Äì51. As other examples of a performance he describes as \\"chock full of R&B; hooks\\", Leng notes the \\"tight, funky\\" support provided by Weeks on bass and Newmark's drums, and a \\"snappy\\" horn arrangement from Scott. The two instrumental breaks, serving as the song's bridges, feature first Preston and Harrison's slide guitar swapping solos, and then Scott (on tenor saxophone) and Harrison. The track ends with a break-down anchored by Weeks's bassline ‚Äì an \\"especially nice\\" section, author Elliot Huntley writes, over which Harrison and Scott continue soloing through the fadeout. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that Harrison overdubbed his vocals at A&M; Studios in Los Angeles,Madinger & Easter, pp. 442, 443. where he combined tour rehearsals with finishing the album, during the last three weeks of October.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 126. \\"MƒÅya Love\\" was among the new songs included in Harrison's setlist for the tour,Badman, p. 137. with a band now augmented by jazz percussionist Emil Richards, horn players Jim Horn and Chuck Findley, and others.Leng, pp. 167, 169. Live performance Due to the delay in completing the album, Dark Horse remained unissued until the final two weeks of the tour, which began at Vancouver's Pacific Coliseum on 2 November 1974. Another result of Harrison finishing the album so late was that he overworked his voice in Los Angeles,Spizer, pp. 259, 260. while carrying out vocal overdubs in the studio at night and rehearsing with his band during the day;Woffinden, p. 84.Clayson, p. 335. as a result, he contracted laryngitis on the eve of the tour.Leng, pp. 166‚Äì67.Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison: Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 72. Harrison's hoarse, Louis Armstrong-likeLavezzoli, p. 196. singing marred the performances for many concertgoersTillery, p. 114. and placed added importance on songs like \\"MƒÅya Love\\", whose lengthy instrumental breaks afforded some respite for his voice.Clayson, p. 338. In its concert version, Leng describes \\"MƒÅya Love\\" as a \\"bottleneck showcase\\" for Harrison and an \\"effective live track\\", \\"full of the stabbing syncopations that characterized 1970s R&B;\\".Leng, pp. 153, 172. As with almost all the songs played on this tour, no live version of \\"MƒÅya Love\\" is available officially, but it appears on the numerous bootlegs from the shows.Madinger & Easter, p. 640.\\"'Maya Love' ‚Äì as performed by George Harrison\\", Bootleg Zone (retrieved 11 March 2013). Aside from the song \\"Dark Horse\\", which Apple distributor Capitol Records had issued as an advance single in Canada and the United States,Spizer, p. 259. the studio version of \\"MƒÅya Love\\" was the first track from the album to receive a public airing. Harrison played a rough mix of the song during his radio interview with KLOL's Levi Booker in the early hours of 25 November,Badman, p. 138. following his well-received evening show at Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion.Leng, p. 170. As when performing the song live, Harrison made a point of spelling out the title, telling Booker: \\"It's called 'MƒÅya Love' ‚Äì m-a-y-a ‚Äì maya, which is a Sanskrit word, which translates as 'That which is not'.\\" Release and reception \\"MƒÅya Love\\" appeared as the final track on side one of Dark Horse in its original LP format, following \\"Bye Bye, Love\\" and before side two's opener, \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\".Castleman & Podrazik, p. 144. Some reviewers have noted the significance of this apparently conceptual sequencing,\\"Dark Horse: The Concept of Concepts\\" (retrieved 12 March 2013). with \\"Bye Bye, Love\\" serving as a sardonic \\"kiss-off\\" to Boyd and Clapton,Rodriguez, p. 65. \\"MƒÅya Love\\" providing a philosophical conclusion to the marital problems documented on side one of the album, and \\"Ding Dong\\" ushering in Harrison's new relationship with Arias.Woffinden, pp. 84‚Äì85. On release, Billboard magazine listed \\"MƒÅya Love\\" among the \\"best cuts\\" on an album that was \\"far more energetic\\" than its predecessor, Living in the Material World (1973), and provided \\"lots of FM potential\\".Bob Kirsch (ed.), \\"Top Album Picks\\", Billboard, 21 December 1974, p. 63 (retrieved 21 November 2014). In another review that compared Dark Horse favourably with Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass, Michael Gross of Circus Raves described the song as \\"a soft, funky rocker spiced by superb Billy Preston piano riffs\\" and noted its role as an answer to the \\"chanted desperation\\" of \\"Bye Bye, Love\\".Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", Circus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 10 March 2013). As with the tour, a number of reviews for the album were unfavourable, however.Schaffner, pp. 177, 178.Greene, p. 213. In one of the most scathing of these,Clayson, p. 342.John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 82. the NMEs Bob Woffinden wrote: \\"No one track [on Dark Horse] has anything like a memorable melody. 'Maya Love' almost sounds like 'My Sweet Lord', though without the positive direction, and by then (the end of side one) George is turning in the same overworked licks quite relentlessly.\\"Bob Woffinden, \\"George Harrison: Dark Horse\\", NME, 21 December 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 10 March 2013). Woffinden found the album's lyrics \\"objectionable\\" and dismissed those on \\"MƒÅya Love\\" as part of \\"the whole oriental mysticism deal we've come to expect from the George we know and are beginning not to love\\". In December 1975, three months after the release of Harrison's Extra Texture album, \\"MƒÅya Love\\" appeared as the B-side to that album's second single, \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\".Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 369, 373. Beatles author Bruce Spizer suggests that the selection of the year-old \\"MƒÅya Love\\" was due to the lack of \\"hit candidates\\" on the melancholic Extra Texture.Spizer, p. 277. \\"This Guitar\\" was Harrison's riposte to the harsh criticism levelled at him for his 1974 tour and the Dark Horse album,Leng, pp. 174, 181. particularly from Rolling Stone magazine.Inglis, p. 51. This single, issued in February 1976 in Britain,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 373. was the final release by Apple Records until its relaunching in the mid 1990s.Rodriguez, pp. 280‚Äì81. While opining that Dark Horse offers \\"a lot of rewarding listening ‚Ä¶ for those willing to listen with an open mind\\", Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp includes \\"MƒÅya Love\\" among the highlights, describing the track as a \\"soulful R&B; number that benefits from Willie Weeks' bass and Billy Preston's electric piano\\".Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison‚Äôs Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 6 October 2014).

Category:Apple Records singles Category:Indian mythology in music Category:Funk songs ","title":"MƒÅya Love"},{"id":"34610160","text":"\\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the final track of his 1974 album Dark Horse. Harrison was inspired to write the song while in the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan, in northern India, with his friend Ravi Shankar. The composition originated on a day that Harrison describes in his autobiography as \\"my most fantastic experience\\",George Harrison, p. 296. during which his party and their ascetic guide toured the city's temples. The song's choruses were adapted from the Sanskrit chant they sang before visiting Seva Kunj, a park dedicated to Krishna's childhood. The same pilgrimage to India led to Harrison staging Shankar's Music Festival from India in September 1974 and undertaking a joint North American tour with Shankar at the end of that year. Despite the devotional nature of the song, Harrison wrote it part-way through a period of divergence from the spiritual goals he had espoused in his previous works, particularly Living in the Material World (1973). \\"It Is 'He'\\" serves as a rare example of an overtly religious song on Dark Horse. Recorded between August and October 1974, the track features an unusual mix of musical styles and instrumentation ‚Äì including gospel-style keyboards, folk-rock acoustic guitar, Indian string and percussion instruments, and Moog synthesizer. Besides Harrison, the musicians on the recording include Billy Preston, Tom Scott and Emil Richards, all of whom played in his 1974 tour band and contributed to Shankar's concurrent release, Shankar Family & Friends. \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" continued Harrison's fusion of the Hindu bhajan tradition with Western pop and rock. The song failed to gain the favourable reception afforded his earlier productions in that style, however, such as \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\" and \\"Give Me Love\\". With his spiritual pronouncements during the tour proving similarly unwelcome to many music critics, Harrison subsequently withdrew from making such public statements of Hindu religiosity until producing Shankar's Chants of India album in 1996. \\"It Is 'He'\\" was the last overtly devotional song released under Harrison's name until the posthumously issued \\"Brainwashed\\" in 2002. Background and inspiration In a 1994 interview held at Ravi Shankar's home in California,Shankar, p. 309. George Harrison referred to the reluctance he used to feel before visiting Shankar in India or meeting with A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the Hare Krishna movement, or more formally the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).Allison, pp. 45‚Äì46. This was due to the \\"craziness\\" taking place in his life, Harrison continued, which sat at odds with the spiritual goals represented by these friends.George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD, Village Roadshow, 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese), Disc 2; event occurs between 14:38 and 15:35. In JanuaryOlivia Harrison, pp. 258, 302. and February 1974, he visited India part-way through a period that he describes in his autobiography, I, Me, Mine (1980), as \\"the naughty years\\", coinciding with the end of his marriage to Pattie Boyd.Leng, p. 148.Tillery, pp. 116‚Äì17. The visit led to Harrison writing two songs that would appear on his Dark Horse album later that year: \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" and \\"Simply Shady\\".George Harrison, pp. 282, 296. While the latter track reflected the singer's recent indulgences with drugs and alcohol,Inglis, pp. 44‚Äì45.Allison, pp. 100, 154. \\"It Is 'He'\\" documented what author Simon Leng terms \\"a spiritual epiphany for Harrison\\" in the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan.Leng, pp. 150‚Äì51, 157. Harrison went to India in 1974 to attend a ceremony in honour of Shankar's new home,Leng, p. 157. in Benares, on the banks of the River Ganges.Shankar, p. 223. At this time, the two musicians came up with the idea for Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from IndiaOlivia Harrison, p. 302.Kevin Howlett's liner notes, Dark Horse CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 5. ‚Äì a revue of Indian folk music presented by an orchestra of eighteen pioneers of the genreLavezzoli, p. 195. ‚Äì and a subsequent joint tour of North America. From Benares, Harrison and Shankar then travelled across the state of Uttar Pradesh to Vrindavan, where the Hindu deity Krishna is said to have spent his childhood, thousands of years before.Greene, p. 209.Tillery, p. 112. Discussing \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" in I, Me, Mine, Harrison recalls that they arrived there at dusk, and adds: \\"the whole town is Krishna conscious ‚Äì everyone, everywhere was chanting 'Hare Krishna' and various permutations on that.\\" =Touring Vrindavan's temples= The Yamuna River at Vrindavan, at sunset ‚Äì Harrison and Shankar stayed at a riverside ashram during their visit to the town. Shankar had arranged for an English-speaking ascetic named Sripad Maharaj to serve as their guide on a tour of the local temples. Despite the bedraggled appearance of Maharaj, Harrison noticed that throughout the tour, swamis and other passers-by would greet the guide by kissing his feet ‚Äì a sign of the utmost reverence. The party slept for a few hours in rooms provided by one of the temples, during which Harrison heard \\"huge heavenly choirs\\" in his dreams and experienced \\"the deepest sleep I had ever had in my life\\".George Harrison, pp. 296‚Äì97. After they had attended morning puja at this temple, at 4 am, Maharaj began singing a bhajan, a Hindu musical prayer. In the tradition of communal chanting, or kirtana, Harrison and the others there sang in response, repeating Maharaj's lines,Tillery, pp. 107, 113. for a period lasting up to five hours. Seva Kunj gardens in Vrindavan, one of the locations that inspired Harrison to write the song Late that morning, Harrison and Shankar accompanied Maharaj to Seva Kunj, a park that commemorates Krishna's love for all-night dancing with his gopis (cow-herd girls).George Harrison, pp. 297, plate XXXVII/p. 390. Harrison later marvelled of Seva Kunj: \\"All the trees, which are so ancient, bow down and the branches touch the ground. Just to walk in that place is incredible.\\"George Harrison, p. 297. In I, Me, Mine, he describes the Vrinadavan tour as \\"my most fantastic experience\\" and says that, at Maharaj's suggestion, he turned the bhajan into a song, titled \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\".George Harrison, pp. 296, 297. =Other activities in Vrindavan= Harrison and Shankar spent a few days in the city, at the Sri Chaitanya Prema Samastbana ashram, on the banks of the Yamuna River; there, they meditated, wrote music and discussed \\"the art of devotion\\".Greene, p. 210. Harrison also met with Prabhupada at this time and reunited with ISKCON disciples Gurudas and Yamuna.Greene, pp. 211, 221. The latter couple were among the founding devotees of the London Radha Krishna Temple,Dwyer & Cole, p. 30. whose recordings of chants, including a hit version of the Hare Krishna mantra,Clayson, pp. 268, 276. Harrison had produced for Apple Records in 1969‚Äì70.Spizer, p. 341. Theologian Dale Allison writes that \\"It Is 'He'\\" resulted from Harrison having \\"rediscovered his enthusiasm for chanting\\" while in India.Allison, p. 147. Composition Leng describes the mood of the song as \\"upbeat pseudo-calypso\\". He views it as a further example of the musical approach that Harrison employed in songs such as \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\", whereby the Hindu bhajan tradition is fused with Western gospel music. The inclusion of Sanskrit verse in \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" recalls both \\"My Sweet Lord\\", which incorporates part of the Hare Krishna mantra as well as other Hindu prayers,Greene, pp. 181‚Äì82, 183.Tillery, pp. 88‚Äì89. and \\"Gopala Krishna\\", an unreleased track that Harrison also recorded for his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970.Madinger & Easter, p. 433. Over a three-chord pattern in the key of G major,\\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\", in George Harrison Dark Horse: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1974). Harrison adapted the words sung at the Vrinadavan kirtana, in a repetitive form typical of a mantra: Aside from offering praise to Krishna, these lines address Radha, his consort and lover,Allison, p. 127. whom ISKCON devotees recognise as the female form of God.Greene, p. 107.Tillery, pp. 70‚Äì71. The words serve as the song's chorus and translate to mean, \\"All glories and praise to Lord Krishna; all glories and praise to Goddess Radha.\\"Allison, p. 46. Similar to Harrison's 1973 song \\"Living in the Material World\\" ‚Äì where he contrasts the Western or \\"material\\" parts of the composition with its meditative, \\"spiritual sky\\" sectionsLeng, pp. 130‚Äì31. ‚Äì \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" employs a change in tempo and rhythm, to differentiate between the Sanskrit choruses and the English-language verses. Lyrically, the latter sections outline the \\"It Is 'He'\\" element of the song title. In the first of the three verses, Harrison sings of his deity as \\"He whose eyes have seen / What our lives have been / And who we really are\\"; in the final verse, the description is: \\"He who is complete / Three worlds at His feet / Cause of every star ...George Harrison, p. 295. Recording Throughout 1974, progress on Dark Horse was compromised by Harrison's commitment to setting up a new record label, also called Dark Horse,Snow, p. 72. and his dedication to projects by the label's first signings, Shankar and the English duo Splinter.Leng, pp. 147‚Äì48.Huntley, pp. 105‚Äì06, 108. With expectations high for his North American tour, the first by a former member of the Beatles,Schaffner, p. 176. Harrison later referred to the pressure he had imposed on himself that year as \\"ridiculous\\".Timothy White, \\"George Harrison ‚Äì Reconsidered\\", Musician, November 1987, p. 59. As a further distraction, his return to less ascetic ways post-Vrinadavan was marked by what he termed \\"a bit of a bender to make up for all the years I'd been married\\",Doggett, pp. 209, 225.Huntley, p. 107. as Boyd left him in July.Tillery, p. 94. Harrison taped an early version of \\"It Is 'He'\\" at his Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire, with Bobby Purvis and Bill Elliott of Splinter on backing vocals. On the officially released recording, he was backed by members of his 1974 tour band,Leng, pp. 157, 167. including Tom Scott (flute), Billy Preston (piano, organ), Willie Weeks (bass) and Andy Newmark (drums).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 197. These four American musicians attended the main sessions for Dark Horse, which took place at FPSHOT over August‚ÄìSeptember,Leng, p. 147. in between rehearsals there for the Music Festival of India's tour of EuropeKevin Howlett's liner notes, Dark Horse CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 4. and the recording of a studio album by Shankar's ensemble, which Harrison also produced.Olivia Harrison, p. 312. Harrison's own contributions to the track included 12-string acoustic guitar and Moog synthesizer. A fourteenth-century fresco showing Krishna playing his flute In October, with his album still unfinished,Tillery, p. 114. Harrison flew to Los Angeles, California, where he rehearsed with his musicians and Shankar's orchestra for the upcoming tour, while carrying out further recording at A&M; Studios. As additional members of the tour band,Leng, p. 167. Jim Horn and Chuck Findley played flutes on \\"It Is 'He'\\" and Emil Richards overdubbed percussion.Madinger & Easter, pp. 443, 444. The completed recording features a mix of musical styles, with the R&B-funk; rhythm section of Weeks and Newmark, gospel keyboards from Preston, and Richards' wobbleboard recalling pre-rock 'n' roll skiffle. Aside from the Western instrumentation he supplied on \\"It Is 'He'\\", Harrison provided Indian music textures through his use of the gut-stringed gubgubbi ‚Äì described by Leng as a \\"banjo-meets-vocal sound\\" ‚Äì as well as small hand-cymbals (or kartal),Leng, pp. 157‚Äì58. commonly played by Hare Krishna devotees during kirtana.Greene, pp. 108, 142, 144.Clayson, p. 247. In addition, according to Leng, the flute parts serve as a musical reference to Krishna, who is often shown playing a flute in scenes depicting his Lila (pastimes) in Vrindavan.Tillery, p. 67. Already suffering from laryngitis, Harrison overtaxed his voice during the weeks of combined recording and rehearsals in Los Angeles,Madinger & Easter, p. 442.Rodriguez, pp. 58, 199. and his hoarse singing would doom his subsequent concerts in the eyes of many observers.Schaffner, p. 177.Snow, pp. 72‚Äì73. Alone among the tracks on Dark Horse, however, \\"It Is 'He'\\" contains a lead vocal that is relatively clean and free of the effects of laryngitis. Release Dark Horse was issued on 9 December 1974, towards the end of Harrison and Shankar's North American tour,Madinger & Easter, pp. 443, 635. with a UK release following on 20 December.Badman, p. 145. The concerts had attracted scorn from many music critics,Woffinden, pp. 83‚Äì84. partly because of Harrison's decision to feature Indian music so heavily in the programSchaffner, pp. 177‚Äì78.Lavezzoli, p. 196. and his frequent statements regarding his Hindu faith.Ingham, p. 128.Tillery, pp. 114‚Äì15.Carol Clerk, \\"George Harrison 1943‚Äì2001\\", Uncut, January 2002, p. 55; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" appeared as the final track on Dark Horse,Spizer, p. 263. sequenced after \\"Far East Man\\",Castleman & Podrazik, p. 144. a song that Harrison biographers interpret variously as a tribute to Shankar and India,Inglis, p. 47. and a reaffirmation of the humanitarian goals represented by Harrison and Shankar's Bangladesh aid project.Allison, pp. 69‚Äì70. In contrast with Living in the Material World in 1973,Kevin Howlett's liner notes, Dark Horse CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 3. \\"It Is 'He'\\" was the sole example of a devotional song on the album.Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", Circus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 5 March 2016). Leng considers that Dark Horse coincided with \\"a crisis of faith\\" on Harrison's part and that, amid confessionals dealing with the singer's troubled personal life and rock-star excess, the track was \\"almost a reminder to himself of golden days in India, when he felt comforted by belief\\".Leng, p. 159. While he identifies a level of religiosity in other songs on Dark Horse, Allison pairs the album with Material World as works that \\"literally wear their Hinduism on their record sleeves\\".Allison, pp. 7, 47, 48. The front cover of Dark Horse includes a Himalayan landscape, above which floats the Nath Tradition yogi Shiv-Goraksha Babaji, while the phrase \\"All glories to Sri Krsna\\" appears on the back cover.Spizer, pp. 263, 265. Among his handwritten notes on the LP's inner sleeve, Harrison included Sripad Maharaj's name in a list headed \\"Thanks to\\".Spizer, pp. 265, 267. The song was published by Oops Publishing (or Ganga in the United States),Spizer, p. 268. the new company that Harrison founded in March 1974.Badman, p. 121. Critical reception Like the North American tour, Dark Horse was much maligned on release.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 44, 46.Greene, p. 213. According to Simon Leng, Harrison's rejection of rock 'n' roll tradition and the Beatles' legacy during the tour was the cause for the album's unfavourable critical reception; in the case of \\"It Is 'He'\\", Leng continues, this manifested as \\"outright hostility\\" from some reviewers, who saw it as \\"one Krishna paen too many\\".Leng, pp. 158, 175‚Äì77. Bob Woffinden of the NME wrote: \\"You keep looking for saving graces [on the album], for words of enthusiasm to pass on ... Tracks like 'It Is HE (Jai Sri Krishna)' are more typical. There, the endless repetition of 'Jai Sri Krishana, Jai Sri Radhe' over an enfeebled tune is hardly compelling listening.\\"Bob Woffinden, \\"George Harrison: Dark Horse\\", NME, 21 December 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 5 March 2016). Writing for Rolling Stone, Jim Miller opined: \\"[Harrison's] religiosity, once a spacey bauble in the Beatles' panoply, has come to resemble the obsessiveness of a zealot.\\"Jim Miller, \\"Dark Horse: Transcendental Mediocrity\\", Rolling Stone, 13 February 1975, pp. 75‚Äì76.Rodriguez, p. 379. In a more favourable review, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker called the song \\"a bit of a groover\\" and credited Harrison with the creation of \\"a new category in music ‚Äì Country and Eastern\\".Brian Harrigan, \\"Harrison: Eastern Promise\\", Melody Maker, 21 December 1974, p. 36. The song has invited varied opinions among Harrison and Beatles biographers. In their book Eight Arms to Hold You, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as \\"an inauspicious ending to a half-baked LP\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 444. Ian Inglis describes the deceleration into half-time during the verses as \\"awkward\\" and notes the failure of \\"It Is 'He'\\" next to Harrison's earlier successes with \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\".Inglis, p. 48. Inglis concludes: \\"The gently floating Indian [choruses] are somewhat undermined by the ponderous nature of the rock-oriented interludes, and the evangelical nature of the English words ‚Äì 'he who is complete' ‚Äì finally discourage any attempt at participation.\\" Author Elliot Huntley describes the song as \\"Krishna-consciousness psychobabble\\", with a refrain that is \\"repeated ad nauseam\\".Huntley, p. 112. Writing in The Rough Guide to the Beatles, Chris Ingham views the track as \\"George at his happy-clappy nadir\\" and pairs it with \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\", which Harrison released as a hoped-for Christmas‚ÄìNew Year hit in the UK, as \\"two of the worst songs he ever allowed out\\".Ingham, p. 134. While also commenting on the underachieving \\"Ding Dong\\" single, Alan Clayson writes: \\"Despite its non-Christian slant, George might have fared better with the wonderful 'It Is \\"He\\" (Jai Sri Krishna)'... [The] repeated chorus was so uplifting that it scarcely mattered that it was sung (without laryngitis) entirely in Hindi ‚Äì no more, anyway, than McCartney breaking into French on 'Michelle' off Rubber Soul.\\"Clayson, p. 344. Robert Rodriguez rates \\"It Is 'He'\\" among Harrison's most overlooked tracks from the 1970s and describes it as \\"a joyful delight\\" and \\"unrelentingly calming yet catchy\\".Rodriguez, pp. 379, 384. Leng notes the song as a continuation of Harrison's successful bhajan‚Äìgospel \\"formula\\", now rendered as \\"Krishna skiffle\\" and set in a \\"Kashmiri party atmosphere\\".Leng, pp. 157, 158, 192. Leng views \\"It Is 'He'\\" as \\"charming\\" and credits Harrison with anticipating the late 1980s world music genre, through his ethnomusicologist's adoption of the Bengali gubgubbi, or khomok.Leng, p. 158. In a review of the 2014 reissue of Dark Horse, for Paste magazine, Robert Ham cited the song as a highlight of the album, writing: \\"The giddy 'Is It \\"He\\" (Jai Sri Krishna)' ... is a joyous affirmation of [Harrison's] spiritual beliefs that mashes up many of his musical interests, with Indian instruments finding consort with rambling English folk and R&B; horn stabs.\\"Robert Ham, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years: 1968‚Äì1975 Review\\", Paste, 24 September 2014 (retrieved 5 March 2016). Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp identified \\"a lot of rewarding listening [on Dark Horse] for those willing to listen with an open mind\\", among which, he continues: \\"'Far East Man' is a smooth soul collaboration with Ron Wood that, once heard, lodges itself in the brain. Even catchier is the closing track, 'It Is \\"He\\" (Jai Sri Krishna).'\\"Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison's Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 5 March 2016). Aftermath and legacy Harrison (left), with his Hare Krishna friends Shyamasundar Das and Mukunda Goswami, in Vrindavan in 1996 First published in August 1980,Tillery, p. 164. I, Me, Mine contains two pages of description from Harrison on Vrindavan and the story behind \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\".Allison, pp. 46, 59. This coverage contrasts with little discussion of his years as a member of the Beatles,Doggett, pp. 265‚Äì66. and typically brief commentary on each of his songs.Staff reviewer, \\"Nonfiction Book Review: I, Me, Mine by George Harrison\\", Publishers Weekly, 2002 (retrieved 5 March 2016).Kent H. Benjamin, \\"Review: I Me Mine\\", The Austin Chronicle, 22 November 2002 (retrieved 5 March 2016). In the book, Harrison dedicates \\"It Is 'He'\\" to Sripad Maharaj, whom he describes as \\"a wonderful, humble, Holy man\\". After 1974, Harrison no longer wrote songs as obviously Krishna-devotional as \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\",The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 140. although he returned to recording bhajans intermittently, with songs such as \\"Dear One\\" in 1976 and \\"Life Itself, released in 1981.Leng, pp. 192, 219‚Äì20. In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the \\"ill-fated 1974 tour\\", Harrison \\"continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface\\".Lavezzoli, p. 197. Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982,Allison, pp. 47, 48, 59. Harrison said: > Back in the sixties, whatever we were all getting into, we tended to > broadcast it as loud as we could. I had had certain realizations and went > through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and > realizations that I wanted to shout and tell it to everybody. But there's a > time to shout it out and a time not to shout it out.Chant and Be Happy, p. > 13. Having distanced himself from the Hare Krishna movement after Prabhupada's death in 1977 and through the 1980s,Tillery, p. 128. Harrison returned to Vrindavan with Mukunda and other devotees in 1996, while in India working on Shankar's album Chants of India.Greene, pp. 251‚Äì52. Leng views the latter project as Harrison returning to the musical statements of his Radha Krishna Temple recordings and \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\".Leng, p. 281. During the Friar Park sessions for Chants of India, Harrison taped the Indian music portions of his song \\"Brainwashed\\", which ends with the Sanskrit prayer \\"Namah Parvati\\".Leng, pp. 304‚Äì05. Dale Allison comments that it was not until the release of this chanted mantra, issued posthumously in 2002, that Harrison again made such an \\"explicit statement\\" of Hindu religiosity as he had on \\"It Is 'He'\\".Allison, p. 48.

Then, he worked for France 2 from 1999 to 2006 as a reporter to the editor and have dealt with conflicts army in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo. In 2002, Jacquier was shot and wounded near the al Ain refugee camp outside Nablus in the northern West Bank while covering the Second Intifada for France 2. Jacquier, who was wearing a bullet proof vest, was shot in the collarbone and recovered. Speaking of his experiences, Jacquier said in an interview, \\"I hate war but in war zone I can meet real people‚Ä¶ Most of the time people are really themselves, very sincere in front of a camera and it's impossible not be moved by their suffering‚Ä¶ Above all, I like filming people as close as possible to the action, with their emotions, but without voyeurism.\\" Since 2006, Jacquier worked for Envoy√© Sp√©cial and reported from all over the world. He worked as a war correspondent for more than twenty years. He shot and submitted most of his own footage. Jacquier reported on location from conflicts in Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the wars in the former Yugoslavia, and, more recently, the Arab Spring from 2010 to 2012. =Personal life= Jacquier had a partner, Caroline Poiron. She is a reporter- photographer working for Paris Match. They have twin girls: Apoline and Clo√©e (born 2010). Gilles Jacquier was the son of Georges Jacquier, who was baker and founder of a ski school at Bernex. His mother died two weeks after the birth of Jacquier's children. His grandfather was the mayor of Bernex for thirty years. =Death= In 2012, Jacquier entered Syria with a visa to cover the Syrian Civil War against Bashar al-Assad. Jacquier and cameraman, Christophe Kenck, were allowed to travel to the city of Homs, a stronghold of the opposition revolt, with the permission of the Syrian government. On 11 January 2012, Jacquier was interviewing local Syrian businesspeople and traveling to a Homs hospital, when a pro-government demonstration organized nearby. It has been claimed that Jacquier was killed in a rocket attack while reporting. and that seven other people were also killed in the attack. His wife claims that he was killed by the government, namely in a plot carried out by Assef Shawkat, Maher al-Assad, Ali Mamluk, and Michel Samaha. She also claims he was killed either by a 22 millimeter gun associated with Syrian secret police or a long knife.https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/commentaryanalysis/the-regime-killed-my- husband Other journalists, as Jacques Duplessy, Patrick Vall√©lian and Sid Ahmed Hammouche, who were present in Homs the day Gilles Jacquier was killed also think the Syrian regime was responsible for this death. A regime defector also claims Gilles Jacquier was deliberately killed in a planned government attack. =Context= Homs is a power base for opponents of the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad meet. Two Swiss journalists, Patrick Vall√©lian of L'Hebdo and Sid Ahmed Hammouche of La Libert√©, who were also working in Homs, accused the Syrian government of being behind the attack that killed Jacquier. Opposition groups also accused the Syrian government of orchestrating the Homs attack. Other opposition sources and Arab League observers blamed anti-Assad rebels. Arab League mission reports from Homs state that Jacquier was killed by mortar shells fired by opposition forces.League of Arab States Observer Mission to Syria: Report of the Head of the League of Arab States Observer Mission to Syria for the period from 24 December 2011 to 18 January 2012. Point 44, page 6. This version is denied by his wife and colleagues, who consider the wounds don't match with a death by mortar. French prosecutors announced a murder investigation into his death, while the French government launched its own independent inquiry. The investigation by the French Ministry of Defence concluded that Jacquier had been killed in an attack carried out by anti-Assad rebels. Caroline Poiron, Jacquier's wife, published the book Attentat Express in June 2013 with Vall√©lian and Hammouche that accuses Syrian government intelligence of a planned killing of her husband. Reactions and awards =Reactions= The head of information for France T√©l√©visions, Thierry Thuillier, called Jacquier one of the best journalists working for the group. On 23 January 2012, France T√©l√©visions named one of its studios \\"studio Gilles Jacquier\\" to honor him. =Awards= Jacquier and his colleague, Bertrand Coq, jointly won the 2003 audiovisual Albert Londres Prize for their work on the France 2 documentary, Naplouse, on the Second Intifada in the Palestinian Territories. In 2007, Jacquier won the TV Journalism Ilari Alpi 2007 for \\"Ukraine, the last frontier\\", a reportage from Envoy√© Sp√©cial. In 2009, he also won the Jean- Louis Calderon price (in the category \\"video\\") about his reportage about Afghanistan, broadcast in Envoy√© Sp√©cial. In June 2011, Jacquier received an award in Italy for best international reporting Ilaria Alpi \\"Tunisia, the revolution in progress\\". In May 2012, Jacquier received the award International Journalism and Human Rights given by the Barcelona Human Rights Film Festival. His widow, Caroline Poiron came to receive the award given in hand by Javier Couso, brother of the camara Jose Couso killed in Iraq in 2004 while he was reporting the war.http://taquillasiete.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/clausura_festival_cine_derechos_humanos/ See also * List of journalists killed during the Syrian Civil War References Category:1968 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People from √âvian-les-Bains Category:French journalists Category:French war correspondents Category:French television journalists Category:Albert Londres Prize recipients Category:War photographers killed while covering the Syrian Civil War Category:Terrorism deaths in Syria Category:Journalists who died as a result of terrorism ","title":"Gilles Jacquier"},{"id":"34610179","text":"\\"The Answer's at the End\\" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison, released in 1975 on his final album for Apple Records, Extra Texture (Read All About It). Part of the song lyrics came from a wall inscription at Harrison's nineteenth-century home, Friar Park, a legacy of the property's original owner, Sir Frank Crisp. This aphorism, beginning \\"Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass\\", had resonated with Harrison since he bought Friar Park in 1970, and it was a quote he often used when discussing his difficult relationship with his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney. Harrison's adaptation of the verse for \\"The Answer's at the End\\" coincided with a period of personal upheaval, following the severe criticism afforded his 1974 North American tour by several influential reviewers. In its plea for tolerance and a musical arrangement that includes orchestral strings, the song recalls Harrison's 1970 hit ballad \\"Isn't It a Pity\\". The arrangement also bears the influence of Nina Simone's 1972 cover version of \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", specifically in a pair of codas performed by Harrison in the soul style. Harrison recorded \\"The Answer's at the End\\" in Los Angeles, where he was overseeing projects relating to his Dark Horse record label during much of 1975. The backing musicians on the recording include members of the Dark Horse Records band Attitudes, among them David Foster and Jim Keltner. As with much of Extra Texture, the song has received a varied response from music critics and Harrison's biographers. On release, Rolling Stone dismissed the track as \\"padded subterfuge\\" and overlong, while Melody Maker described it as \\"majestic\\" and one of Harrison's \\"most potent tracks ever, highly emotional and introspective\\". Background and inspiration Gatehouse detail at Harrison's Friar Park estate, built by Sir Frank Crisp In March 1970, George Harrison and his first wife, Pattie Boyd, moved into their Victorian Gothic residence at Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 42.Boyd, p. 146. The 120-room house was built in the 1890sO'Dell, pp. 135, 137. on the site of a thirteenth-century friary by Frank Crisp, a City of London solicitor and microscopist. Harrison was immediately taken with Crisp's penchant for whimsy,Harrison, p. 68. the legacies of which included interior features such as doorknobs and light switches shaped as monks' faces (which meant \\"tweaking\\" a nose in order to turn each light on),Clayson, pp. 300, 301. and a carving of a monk's head that showed him smiling on one side and frowning on the other.Greene, p. 166. A keen horticulturalist and an authority on medieval gardening,Anita McConnell, \\"Crisp, Sir Frank, first baronet (1843‚Äì1919)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, January 2007 (subscription required; retrieved 26 February 2013). Crisp established 10 acres of formal gardens,O'Dell, p. 136. which similarly reflected his eccentric tastes.Boyd, pp. 144, 145. From midway through the twentieth century until 1969, ownership of Friar Park resided with the Roman Catholic Church.Harrison, p. 67.Clayson, p. 301. As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house,Greene, p. 168. but outside, signs reading \\"Don't keep off the grass\\", \\"Herons will be prosecuted\\" and \\"Eton boys are a Harrowing sight\\" remained intact.O'Dell, p. 137. Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning, which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as \\"like songs really, about the devil, about friendship, life\\".Greene, p. 165. One example was \\"Shadows we are and shadows we depart\\", written on a stone sundial;Clayson, p. 302. another began: \\"Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / You know his faults, now let his foibles pass ...\\"Greene, p. 171. This four-line verse was written above an entrance-way in a garden wall,Boyd, p. 144. and it was an aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews.Badman, p. 6. On 28 April 1970, just over two weeks after the Beatles' break-up, he used the words during an interview for New York's WPLQ Radio,Badman, pp. 6‚Äì7. as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles.\\"It's Really a Pity\\", Contra Band Music, 15 March 2012 (retrieved 9 July 2012). In October 1974 ‚Äì towards the end of what Harrison termed a \\"bad domestic year\\", following his split with BoydHarrison, p. 69. ‚Äì he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman,Badman, pp. 138‚Äì39. when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-Beatles.\\"That's Entertainment\\", Contra Band Music, 10 October 2012 (retrieved 23 December 2013).\\"Interview with George Harrison\\", Rock Around the World, program 61, 5 October 1975. Harrison wrote his first Friar Park-inspired composition, \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\", within two months of moving in.Madinger & Easter, p. 431. As with the \\"Crispisms\\" that surfaced in the lyrics to his 1974 single \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\",Badman, p. 144. a number of years elapsed before he incorporated the \\"Scan not a friend\\" inscription into a song.Harrison, p. 300. In 1975, it provided the central theme to \\"The Answer's at the End\\",Rodriguez, p. 385. a composition that, theologian Dale Allison has written, \\"expresses the personal doubts and religious uncertainty George experienced in the mid-1970s\\".Allison, pp. 135‚Äì36. This temporary uncertainty contrasted with his previous devotion to a Hindu-aligned spiritual path.Allison, pp. 7‚Äì8. It was also a period marked by Harrison's excessive use of alcohol and cocaineGreene, pp. 219, 220.Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison: Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, November 2014, pp. 72‚Äì73. ‚Äì a symptom of his despondency following his troubled 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, and the generally unfavourable reception afforded his Dark Horse album.Rodriguez, p. 384.Tillery, pp. 116, 117. Composition Frank Crisp in 1904. One of the inspirational verses he had carved in stone at Friar Park provided the central theme for Harrison's song. The song begins in the key of D,\\"George's handwritten lyrics for 'The Answer's at the End'\\", booklet with Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), pp. 10, 16. before changing key to F for the choruses.\\"The Answer's at the End\\", in George Harrison Extra Texture: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1975). In its musical mood, authors Robert Rodriguez and Elliot Huntley liken the released recording to \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", which, like \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\", was co-produced by Phil Spector and issued on Harrison's 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass.Spizer, pp. 211, 219.Woffinden, pp. 37‚Äì38. Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes \\"The Answer's at the End\\" as a ballad set to a \\"mellow, reflective soul mood\\", like much of its parent album, Extra Texture (Read All About It).Leng, pp. 180, 186. According to the way he renders Crisp's inscription in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison made a minor alteration to the original text's third line (\\"Life is one long enigma, true, my friend\\") for his opening verse:Harrison, pp. 300, 302. In another passage from I, Me, Mine, read out by his son Dhani in the 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World,Dhani Harrison interview, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World. Harrison explains that these words helped him reach a better understanding of human relationships and others around him. The theme of tolerance is further reflected in the song's chorus, where Harrison urges: \\"Don't be so hard on the ones that you love / It's the ones that you love, we think so little of ...\\" The chorus lyrics echo the message of \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", in this case, author Ian Inglis writes, providing a \\"bleak assessment of the human condition\\".Inglis, p. 50. The second verse begins with an example of what Harrison biographer Alan Clayson views as the \\"restricted code\\" found in the lyrics on much of Extra Texture.Clayson, p. 349. Harrison sings, \\"The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech / But what's often in your heart is the hardest thing to reach\\" ‚Äì the second line of which, Allison writes, \\"is surely [Harrison] talking about his inability to find God, who for him dwells, above all, inside the human being\\".Allison, p. 8. Allison suggests that, with the singer describing life as first an \\"enigma\\" and then a \\"mystery\\", the previous certainties of his faith have disappeared; true to the song title, Allison continues, \\"Only death will reveal ... whether his religious beliefs have been true or false.\\" Nina Simone's soulful rendition of Harrison's song \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" inspired the two codas in \\"The Answer's at the End\\". As a further reference to the sentiment regarding friendship expressed in \\"Isn't It a Pity\\",Leng, pp. 86‚Äì87. the middle section of \\"The Answer's at the End\\" reflects the influence of Nina Simone's 1972 cover of that earlier song.Huntley, p. 124. According to his recollection in I, Me, Mine, Harrison added this section, or coda, when recording \\"The Answer's at the End\\". In the lines \\"And isn't it a pity how / We hurt the ones we love the most of all ...\\", Inglis notes the influence of the 1944 pop standard \\"You Always Hurt the One You Love\\".Inglis, pp. 50‚Äì51. In the final half-verse, following a brief instrumental passage, Harrison personalises the second line of Crisp's text to \\"You know my faults, now let my foibles pass\\".Harrison, p. 302. Rodriguez remarks that the subject of reserving judgement would have resonated with Harrison at this time, given the \\"shellacking\\" he had recently received in music publications such as Rolling Stone.Rodriguez, pp. 59, 385. On the released recording, the song fades out during a repeat of the \\"isn't it a pity how ...\\" coda. Among the former Beatle's biographers, interpretations differ over the message of Extra Texture songs such as \\"The Answer's at the End\\", with regard to his spirituality. Like Dale Allison, Gary Tillery writes of Extra Texture revealing Harrison's \\"inner turmoil at having strayed from his faith\\".Tillery, pp. 116‚Äì17. Leng views this composition as \\"a deliberate tempering of tone rather than a change in fundamental beliefs\\", however, with the song's choruses \\"attenuat[ing] the search for universal solutions to a simpler, earthbound observation\\". Joshua Greene similarly writes that Harrison had \\"regained strength and relaxed his missionary zeal\\" during 1975. Greene references \\"The Answer's at the End\\" while stating that \\"a modest appeal for tolerance\\" had now replaced the singer's earlier \\"exhortations to chant and warnings about rebirth in the material world\\".Greene, p. 221. Recording Harrison taped the basic track for \\"The Answer's at the End\\" at A&M; Studios in Los Angeles on 22 April 1975.Madinger & Easter, p. 452. During the previous month, Harrison attended a press party held by McCartney and the latter's band, Wings, on board the Queen Mary at Long Beach.Ray Coleman, \\"Dark Horse\\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 28.Huntley, p. 121. This event marked the first social meeting between the two former bandmates since December 1970Badman, pp. 16, 156. and, according to McCartney biographer Howard Sounes, was evidence of a \\"Beatles rapprochement\\", five years after their break- up.Sounes, p. 320. Authors Nicholas Schaffner and Rodriguez have commented on the rushed and expedient nature of the sessions for Extra Texture,Schaffner, p. 182.Rodriguez, pp. 247‚Äì48. an album that saw out Harrison's commitments to EMI-affiliated Apple Records and allowed him to sign with his own, A&M-distributed; label, Dark Horse Records.Clayson, p. 348. Rather than use his Friar Park studio, Harrison recorded the album at a facility he admitted to finding \\"technically limiting\\",Madinger & Easter, p. 451. since he was in Los Angeles overseeing projects by his various Dark Horse acts when studio time became available, following the cancellation of sessions for Splinter's second album.Leng, pp. 178‚àí79. Another of these acts was Attitudes,Rodriguez, p. 81.Woffinden, pp. 85‚Äì86. a band put together by his friend, session drummer Jim Keltner.Clayson, pp. 347‚Äì48. \\"The timing was perfect,\\" Leng writes of Harrison's approach to making Extra Texture, \\"as this latest signing to Dark Horse provided a ready-made backup band, close at hand.\\"Leng, p. 179. Although Attitudes guitarist Danny Kortchmar did not play on the album, \\"The Answer's at the End\\" was one of two songs that featured all three of the other band members:Spizer, pp. 274, 275. Keltner, pianist/musical arranger David Foster and bassist/lead singer Paul Stallworth.George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 1 July 2012). Another guest musician on the recording was keyboard player Gary Wright, a regular contributor to Harrison's solo work throughout the 1970sInglis, p. 71.Rodriguez, pp. 87‚Äì88. starting with the session for \\"Isn't It a Pity\\".\\"When Gary Wright Met George Harrison: Dream Weaver, John and Yoko, and More\\", The Daily Beast, 29 September 2014 (retrieved 24 September 2017).Melissa Parker, \\"Gary Wright Interview: The 'Dream Weaver' Gets 'Connected,' Tours with Ringo Starr\\", Smashing Interviews, 28 September 2010 (retrieved 24 September 2017). A&M; engineer Norman Kinney, who had carried out the mix down for the Concert for Bangladesh recordings four years before,Interview with Norman Kinney and Steve Mitchell, in The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited with George Harrison and Friends DVD, Apple Corps, 2005 (directed by Claire Ferguson; produced by Olivia Harrison, Jonathan Clyde and Jo Human). added the song's percussion, which the mastering sheet lists as tambourine and shaker.24-track master reel information, booklet with Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 5. As for all the songs on the album, overdubs on the basic track were carried out between 31 May and 6 June.Spizer, p. 274. A string arrangement, written and conducted by Foster, was recorded at A&M; on 6 June. Huntley describes \\"The Answer's at the End\\" as \\"the first of the piano songs\\" on Extra Texture. While piano and other keyboard instrumentation was typically favoured throughout the album,Huntley, pp. 122‚Äì23, 146.Leng, pp. 179‚Äì80, 194. the song also contains multiple guitar parts, in keeping with the sound more usually associated with Harrison.Schaffner, pp. 159‚Äì60, 178‚Äì79. Credited to Harrison,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 375. these parts comprise 12-string acoustic guitar, electric guitar arpeggios over the choruses, and a brief solo. During the quieter, \\"isn't it a pity how ...\\" codas, Huntley notes \\"the merest veneer of the strings\\" accompanying Harrison's vocal. In Leng's description, Harrison \\"semi-scats\\" over these \\"smoochy\\" sections, \\"gospel style, over sundown jazz piano\\"Leng, p. 181. ‚Äì a vocal affectation that reflected his immersion in the soul genre.Inglis, p. 52. Following the first coda, the full band returns for the short instrumental break, after which Harrison repeats the choruses, with his singing increasing in emotion. Release and reception \\"The Answer's at the End\\" was released on 22 September 1975.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 369. It was sequenced as the second track on Extra Texture (Read All About It), between \\"You\\" and \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\".Spizer, p. 273. Some music critics immediately derided the song for its funereal tempo,Leng, p. 180. which was all the more obvious after the upbeat \\"You\\". Writing in 1981, author and critic Bob Woffinden paired the song with \\"This Guitar\\" as examples of Harrison asking for tolerance from his detractors, and considered that the inclusion of orchestral strings on the album was an attempt to achieve a \\"commercial bias\\".Woffinden, p. 86. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone referred to \\"The Answer's at the End\\" as \\"padded subterfuge\\" which could \\"easily\\" have been cut down to two minutes from its length of 5:32.Dave Marsh, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture \\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975, p. 75 (retrieved 10 July 2012). In the NME, Neil Spencer said that, following \\"You\\", \\"hopes of Hari's revival are comprehensively dashed by five-and-a-half minutes of the inordinately dreary 'The Answer's At The End'\\". Spencer described it as \\"one of Hari's Homespun Homilies full of crusty chunks of potted wisdom\\".Neil Spencer, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture (Apple)\\", NME, 20 September 1975, p. 23.Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 103. In his favourable review for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman wrote that Extra Texture represented \\"a re-statement of the fundamentals we should all cherish\\" and that \\"The Answer's at the End\\" was Harrison \\"at his most expressive, vocally\\", as well as \\"by far the most majestic track on the album\\". Coleman also said it was \\"One of George's most potent tracks ever, highly emotional and introspective\\" and predicted that its universal theme would encourage several cover recordings.Ray Coleman, \\"Extra Texture: Back to the Sixties!\\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 30. Retrospective assessment Writing 21 years after its release, Alan Clayson dismissed the song as \\"archaic parlour poetry\\" on an album full of \\"long, dull melodies\\".Clayson, pp. 349‚Äì50. Simon Leng admires the \\"warm sonic scenes\\" of \\"The Answer's at the End\\" and recognises it as an \\"interesting\\" composition, one that \\"ponders the nature of relationships\\" in a similar way to Bob Dylan's 1975 album Blood on the Tracks.Leng, pp. 180‚Äì81. Leng pairs the song with another Extra Texture track, \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\", however, as \\"two slabs of introspection\\" that suffer from being \\"part calls for tolerance and part expression of downright despair\\".Leng, p. 186. While similarly noting the bleakness of the subject matter, Ian Inglis opines: \\"The lack of optimism in his words is matched by a largely inconspicuous melody and an inconsistent production in which alternate piano, strings, and guitar interludes fail to provide a coherent musical context.\\"Inglis, p. 51. Music journalist Rip Rense cites \\"The Answer's at the End\\" as an example of how \\"even the rather hasty\\" Extra Texture offers \\"some of the most affecting moments in [Harrison's] career\\". With reference to the song's second verse, Rense adds: \\"and how many songwriters have ever sung a line as wonderful as 'The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech?'\\"Rip Rense, \\"There Went the Sun: Reflection on the Passing of George Harrison\\", Beatlefan, 29 January 2002 (retrieved 14 December 2014). Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as a \\"highlight\\" of the album, while Elliot Huntley terms it a \\"gorgeously melodic song of forgiveness\\".Huntley, p. 123. Huntley praises the track's \\"epic sweep\\" and writes of the Simone-inspired coda: \\"This is one of my favourite moments of the entire Harrison back-catalogue, especially when the ensemble returns to see the song through to its conclusion ...\\" AllMusic's Richard Ginell describes \\"The Answer's at the End\\" as one of Harrison's \\"most beautifully harmonized, majestic, strangely underrated ballads\\".Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", AllMusic (retrieved 9 July 2012). Along with \\"You\\" and \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\", Ginell rates the song \\"among the best\\" from Harrison's solo career. In his book covering the Beatles' first decade as solo artists, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, Robert Rodriguez includes \\"The Answer's at the End\\" in a chapter discussing eight overlooked Harrison compositions, and comments that the song's \\"grace and majesty\\" is reminiscent of \\"Isn't It a Pity\\".Rodriguez, pp. 379, 385. In December 2001, Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White, a longstanding friend of the former Beatle, titled his Harrison obituary \\"The Answer's at the End\\".Timothy White, \\"The Answer's at the End: George Harrison, 1943‚Äì2001\\", Billboard, 15 December 2001, p. 7 (retrieved 3 March 2015).

New Zealand music critic Graham Reid writes that \\"the melancholy and string-enhanced The Answer's At the End makes a lovely plea\\", and he suggests that had Harrison recorded the track with Phil Spector, it \\"might not have sounded out of place\\" on All Things Must Pass.Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014).

Harrison wrote the composition as a tribute to American singer Smokey Robinson, whom he often identified as one of his favourite vocalists and songwriters. The song was intended as a companion piece to Robinson's 1965 hit with the Miracles, \\"Ooo Baby Baby\\", and its inclusion on Extra Texture contributed to that album's standing as Harrison's soul music album. His impersonation of Robinson's celebrated vocal style on the track, including portions sung in falsetto, contrasted with Harrison's hoarse, laryngitis- marred singing on his 1974 North American tour and the poorly received Dark Horse album. Harrison recorded \\"Ooh Baby\\" at A&M; Studios in Los Angeles between April and June 1975, with backing from rock musicians Jesse Ed Davis, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. In addition, the recording features an overdubbed horn section comprising Tom Scott and Chuck Findley. The song's sombre tone and slow tempo reflect Harrison's dejected mood following the criticism of his tour the previous year. Partly as a result of these solemn qualities, the track is held in low regard by several music critics. Some commentators instead highlight \\"Pure Smokey\\", released on Harrison's 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3, as the more effective of his tributes to Robinson. Background Smokey Robinson (centre) and the Miracles performing on an ABC Television special in 1970 George Harrison biographer Alan Clayson has written that, while all of the Beatles were influenced by Tamla-Motown artists in the early and mid 1960s, Harrison \\"listened hardest\\" to the Miracles, and particularly the group's lead singer, Smokey Robinson.Clayson, p. 84. In interviews during the 1970s, Harrison frequently praised Robinson as a vocalist and a songwriter,Harrison, p. 320.Huntley, p. 125. and once described him as having an \\"effortless butterfly of a voice\\". While the influence of soul music had been evident in Harrison's 1971 hit song \\"What Is Life\\", it was a genre that he began to embrace more obviously later in the decade, beginning with his 1974 collaboration with Faces guitarist Ron Wood, \\"Far East Man\\".Leng, pp. 88, 156. Harrison's version of that song appeared on his Dark Horse album,Spizer, p. 263. a release that, like his concurrent North American tour with Ravi Shankar, was vilified by some sections of the music press, notably Rolling Stone magazine,Rodriguez, pp. 59, 384. a publication that had traditionally championed his work.Huntley, p. 112. This critical backlash left Harrison emotionally battered,Greene, pp. 219‚Äì20. and came as a further source of personal upheaval following his split with wife Pattie Boyd in July 1974.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 46.Tillery, pp. 115, 116. Author Robert Rodriguez remarks on Harrison's choice of musical direction for his next album, Extra Texture (Read All About It): \\"Since it developed into a discernible genre in the late '50s/early '60s, soul [music] ‚Äì as an outgrowth of blues ‚Äì was the medium of choice among the oppressed to express their interactions with a world (or a romantic partner) that often misunderstood or abused them. As such, it proved the perfect format for George in his efforts to work through his many issues.\\"Rodriguez, pp. 384‚Äì85. Harrison wrote the slow soul ballad \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\" in the spring of 1975, shortly before starting recording for Extra Texture.Madinger & Easter, p. 451. The song was Harrison's musical tribute to Robinson.Clayson, p. 358. In an interview held at his Los Angeles home that April, with disc jockey Dave Herman,Badman, p. 158. Harrison included Smokey Robinson among his preferred artists, along with Shankar, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton, and added: \\"Musically, he's so sweet ... he makes you feel nice ‚Äì he makes me feel good.\\"\\"No Clear Blue Skies\\", Contra Band Music, 2 November 2012 (retrieved 29 April 2013).\\"George Harrison ‚Äì Interview (1975)\\", Paste (retrieved 12 November 2016); event occurs between 53:20 and 53:34. Composition In his musical biography of George Harrison, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Simon Leng describes the song as a \\"spiritual brother\\" to the Miracles' 1965 hit \\"Ooo Baby Baby\\".Leng, p. 182. Leng writes that Harrison employs \\"all manner of subtle chord voices\\" in the composition, including \\"elegant, jazzy thirteenths and major ninths\\". Author Ian Inglis comments on Harrison's \\"unexpectedly mournful\\" melody and suggests that the song \\"betray[s] a continuing, pessimistic reflection on recent events and circumstances in his life\\".Inglis, p. 52. In an example of what Clayson identifies as the sparse, \\"cursory\\" lyrics found on much of Extra Texture,Clayson, p. 349. the words to the chorus in \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\" repeat and improvise on the song title.Song lyrics, booklet with Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 13. Inglis describes this lyrical approach as \\"simplistic\\" and \\"seek[ing] to create emotion through mere repetition\\".Inglis, pp. 52, 53. In the two verses, Harrison tells his lover ‚Äì presumably Olivia Arias, Inglis suggests, his girlfriend and constant companion since October 1974:Tillery, pp. 115‚Äì16. As with other songs of his that Leng terms \\"[obvious] pop cuts\\", such as \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" and \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\",Leng, pp. 184, 186. Harrison makes no mention of \\"Ooh Baby\\" in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine.Harrison, pp. 383‚Äì86. While writing the song in 1975, Harrison began a second tribute to Robinson, titled \\"Pure Smokey\\".Madinger & Easter, pp. 452, 455. The latter composition was released on Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), a collection noted for Harrison's apparent rediscovery of his gift for creating accessible melodies.Schaffner, p. 192. Recording The Extra Texture album is \\"unique within the Harrison catalog\\", Rodriguez writes, \\"as essentially an LP-length excursion into soul\\".Rodriguez, p. 385. While noting a pragmatic, commercial approach on Harrison's part with regard to making Extra Texture, Leng suggests that \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\" was designed to create \\"crossover appeal to the R&B; audience\\".Leng, pp. 178, 182, 186. Harrison recorded the album in Los Angeles during the late spring and early summer of 1975, while working on business related to his A&M; Records-distributed label, Dark Horse Records,Leng, pp. 178‚Äì79. a recent signing to which was the soul group Stairsteps.Clayson, pp. 345, 348. Among several concerts the couple attended during their time in Los Angeles,Hunt, p. 101.Badman, pp. 163, 164. Arias recalls that she and Harrison watched Robinson perform at the Roxy and that the singer was \\"really flattered\\" by Harrison's enthusiasm for his music.Kevin Howlett's liner notes, booklet with Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 6. Philadelphia sound of the Stylistics Harrison taped the basic track for \\"Ooh Baby\\" at A&M; Studios in Hollywood on 25 April.Madinger & Easter, p. 452. Despite his apparent intention to create a genuine soul recording, Harrison worked with the same musicians associated with his previous, UK-recorded albums:Huntley, p. 122.Inglis, p. 50. Gary Wright (Fender Rhodes24-track master reel information, booklet with Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 5. electric piano), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 376. In addition, Jesse Ed Davis ‚Äì who performed with Harrison, Voormann, Keltner and others at the Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971Rodriguez, p. 50. ‚Äì joined Harrison on electric guitar.Spizer, p. 274. Harrison's two guitar parts were treated with a Leslie rotary effect. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that Wright may have overdubbed his contribution at a later date. Two members of Harrison's 1974 tour band, Tom Scott and Chuck Findley, added horns at A&M; Studios on 2‚Äì3 June,Madinger & Easter, pp. 447, 452. with each musician overdubbing two parts.George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 30 April 2013). Leng describes Harrison's vocal as \\"his best Smokey impersonation, almost going falsetto\\". Harrison's singing on Dark Horse had been the focus of critical scorn in America,Greene, pp. 213, 216. after he contracted laryngitis on the eve of the 1974 tour.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44. With his voice restored by early 1975,Huntley, p. 126. his vocals were close-miked during recording but mixed low on songs such as \\"Ooh Baby\\".Clayson, p. 348. Leng speculates of this effect that \\"the goal was to create a Harrison soul album for lovers\\",Leng, p. 180. while Clayson views it as \\"the backbone of Extra Texture\\", similar to \\"the feathery emanations from Philadelphia by the likes of the Stylistics and Jerry Butler\\".Clayson, pp. 348‚Äì49. Release and reception Extra Texture (Read All About It) was released in September 1975, just nine months after Dark Horse,Schaffner, pp. 182, 212. with \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\" appearing as track 4 on side one in the LP format.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 369. The back of the Roy Kohara-designed album cover carried a dedication to Smokey Robinson.Spizer, pp. 274, 275, 276. For the first time as a solo artist, Harrison undertook promotion for his album,Huntley, p. 123. in the UK, which included a song-by-song discussion with BBC Radio 1 DJ Paul Gambaccini.Badman, pp. 164‚Äì65. When discussing \\"Ooh Baby\\", Harrison said that he was \\"not anywhere in [Robinson]'s league\\" as a singer, but the song \\"always reminds me of that Smokey type of mood\\".Badman, pp. 164, 165.George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 30 April 2013). Among music critics, Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977, \\"even his disciples tended to find the music plodding and aimless\\".Schaffner, p. 182. In another unfavourable album review from Rolling Stone,Huntley, pp. 126, 128‚Äì29. Dave Marsh opined that \\"Too often, Harrison's affectingly feeble voice is buried in a muddy, post-Spector mix\\" on Extra Texture, and that \\"Ooh Baby\\" \\"fails simply because he isn't much of a melodist\\".Dave Marsh, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975 (retrieved 30 April 2013). Neil Spencer of the NME wrote of \\"Ooh Baby\\": \\"the vocals try unsuccessfully to capture some kind of intimacy of soft soul. All form, no content, and you can't whistle it.\\"Neil Spencer, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture (Apple)\\", NME, 20 September 1975, p. 23.Hunt, p. 103. Writing more recently, for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham pairs the song with \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" as two examples of Harrison's \\"threadbare\\" compositions on Extra Texture and the \\"slick playing\\" found throughout the album.Ingham, p. 134. In a 2002 article on Harrison's solo career, for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson described the collection as \\"patchy\\" but listed \\"the contemplative (if somewhat Wings-ish) 'Ooh Baby'\\" as one of the few tracks that should not be \\"overlook[ed]\\".Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 17. Alone among Harrison's biographers, Elliot Huntley praises the song, calling it \\"a sincere pastiche of the Smokey Robinson gossamer\\" with a falsetto vocal \\"coated in velvet\\". While similarly admiring Harrison's singing, Simon Leng writes of Gary Wright's \\"chiffon\\" keyboard part and Tom Scott's \\"balmy horns charts\\", but he dismisses \\"Ooh Baby\\" as commercially driven and designed to \\"not offend anyone\\".Leng, pp. 182, 186. Alan Clayson bemoans the \\"'Far East Man'-type lethargy\\" of this and other tracks on Extra Texture, an album he labels \\"[Harrison's] artistic nadir\\".Clayson, pp. 348, 350. Ian Inglis views the song as inferior to the Miracles' \\"Ooo Baby Baby\\", lacking the latter's \\"natural lightness of touch\\", and bemoans Harrison's \\"wholly inappropriate choice of melody\\". \\"Instead of creating a mood of happiness with what is,\\" Inglis continues, \\"or excitement at what may be, the track produces an atmosphere of gloom and despondency that is quite removed from the positive emotions contained in the words.\\" Echoing Leng's admiration for \\"Pure Smokey\\",Leng, pp. 195‚Äì96. Madinger and Easter write of \\"Ooh Baby\\": \\"Not one of his more inspired efforts lyrically ... [Harrison] was to do a much better job of saluting Smokey on his next LP ...\\" Writing for Blogcritics in 2014, Seattle-based critic\\"Chaz Lipp\\", The Morton Report (retrieved 7 October 2014). Chaz Lipp similarly opines: \\"Vocally he simply wasn't up to the Smokey Robinson pastiche 'Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)' ('Pure Smokey' on 1976's Thirty-Three & 1/3 is far better).\\"Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison‚Äôs Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 7 October 2014). In another review of the 2014 Apple Years Harrison reissues, for Mojo, Tom Doyle says of Extra Texture: \\"Here George sounds depressed, if R&B-soulful;, with Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You) sharing its DNA with Bowie's Young Americans ‚Ä¶\\"Tom Doyle, \\"Hari Styles: George Harrison The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 109. In his feature on Harrison in the same issue of Mojo, Mat Snow admires the track as \\"a sincere synth-soul tribute\\" and \\"perhaps the best song\\" on the album.Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison: Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 73. Joe Marchese of The Second Disc describes it and \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" as two tracks that \\"happily reflected [Harrison's] newfound bliss with Olivia\\".Joe Marchese, \\"Review: The George Harrison Remasters ‚Äì 'The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975'\\", The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 10 October 2014).

","title":"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)"},{"id":"34610198","text":"\\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released in 1975 on his final album for Apple Records, Extra Texture (Read All About It). A love song in the style of a soul/R&B; ballad, it was written by Harrison in December 1973, towards the end of his marriage to Pattie Boyd and while he was having an affair with Maureen Starkey, the wife of his former Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr. Having first considered the song for his 1974 release Dark Horse, Harrison recorded \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" in Los Angeles in May 1975 for his so-called \\"soul album\\", Extra Texture. Some authors view its inclusion on the latter release as an obvious attempt by Harrison to commercialise the album, in response to the harsh critical reception afforded Dark Horse and his 1974 North American tour. The backing musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins, Jesse Ed Davis and David Foster, the last of whom also contributed a string arrangement. On release, \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" was considered by some music critics to be a highlight of its parent album. In spite of the song's commercial qualities, it was passed over for release as the second single from Extra Texture in favour of \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\". Among opinions in the 21st century, commentators have tended to dismiss the composition as repetitious and inconsequential, with author Simon Leng describing it as \\"pop-soul fluff\\". Background and composition Although he omits any discussion of the song from his autobiography, I, Me, Mine (1980),Harrison, pp. 383‚Äì86. George Harrison told interviewers in September 1975 that he wrote \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" over Christmas 1973.Madinger & Easter, p. 452.George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 5 June 2014). This period coincided with the end of Harrison's relationship with his first wife, Pattie Boyd,Tillery, pp. 94, 116. who has described their home, Friar Park, as a \\"madhouse\\" during their final year together.Boyd, p. 175. In her 2009 memoir, music-industry insider Chris O'Dell recalls spending the 1973 Christmas holiday with the couple and learning that Harrison was having an affair with Maureen Starkey, the wife of his fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr.O'Dell, pp. 256‚Äì58. On the night of 23 December, with both wives and O'Dell present,O'Dell, pp. 262‚Äì63. Harrison duly announced to Starr that he was in love with Maureen.Tillery, pp. 93‚Äì94.Boyd, p. 177. Author Simon Leng pairs the song with \\"Simply Shady\\", as being a musical document of Harrison's \\"many nights spent nursing a bottle of brandy\\" while his marriage collapsed.Leng, p. 165. Harrison himself termed the 1973‚Äì74 period his \\"naughty\\" years,Mick Brown, \\"An Interview with George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).Harrison, pp. 274, 282. signifying bouts of rock-star excess and deviation from his Hindu-aligned spiritual path.Allison, p. 7.Tillery, p. 116. A Christian theologian, Dale Allison, views \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" as a \\"typical, mid-seventies pop love song\\" and finds that it \\"contains no theology\\" ‚Äì unlike many of Harrison's love songs, which appear to be directed at both a woman and a deity.Allison, pp. 12, 127, 138. The lyrics consist mainly of the song title repeated at length,Inglis, p. 53. with the words \\"It's no good living without you\\" providing the chorus's third line.Song lyrics, booklet with Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 14. The two verses are equally \\"simplistic\\", Harrison biographer Alan Clayson writes,Clayson, p. 349. as Harrison first states that, with the arrival of night-time, \\"Daylight has left me ‚Ä¶ / I can't take it if I don't see you no more\\", before altering the temporal context in verse two to morning, when \\"The daylight gets to me ...\\" Author Ian Inglis concludes of the song-wide message in \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\": \\"Day or night, Harrison's thoughts never stray from the lover who has left him ...\\" Musically, the composition is in the \\"soul-pop\\" style, Leng writes,Leng, pp. 184, 186. reflecting Harrison's return to the soul music genre over 1974‚Äì76, after his earlier projects with Apple Records signings Doris Troy, Billy Preston and Ronnie Spector.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 192. Author Robert Rodriguez similarly describes it as \\"an R&B-style; weeper\\".Rodriguez, p. 184. When discussing the song with Paul Gambaccini on BBC Radio 1, in September 1975,Badman, pp. 164, 165. Harrison remarked on the \\"melodramatic\\" melody over the verses (or \\"middle bits\\"), likening it to the extravagant musical styles of Al Jolson and Mario Lanza. Even though the Harrison‚ÄìMaureen Starkey liaison had become common knowledge by late 1974Schaffner, p. 176. ‚Äì when Harrison released his album Dark Horse and mounted a North American tour with Ravi ShankarWoffinden, pp. 83‚Äì84. ‚Äì some critics later interpreted the song as being directed at Boyd,Huntley, p. 126. who had left him for his friend Eric Clapton in July that same year.Tillery, p. 94. Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley suggests that, by the time Harrison recorded \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" in 1975, for Extra Texture (Read All About It), the subject is more likely to have been Olivia Arias. The latter was working as a secretary for Harrison's Dark Horse record label in Los Angeles when they first met,Greene, pp. 220‚Äì21. in October 1974,Harrison, p. 1. after which she became his constant companion and, later, his wife.Rodriguez, p. 424. Recording Harrison first recorded \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" for Dark Horse,\\"Announcing The Apple Years 1968‚Äì75 Box set ‚Äì Released 22nd September\\", georgeharrison.com, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 10 October 2014). in June 1974, but left the song unfinished.Essay by Kevin Howlett, booklet with Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 9. With that album and the accompanying tour having received negative reviews from Rolling Stone and other music publications over the winter of 1974‚Äì75,Rodriguez, pp. 59, 384. NME critic Bob Woffinden noted an \\"eagerness\\" on Harrison's part to \\"redeem himself\\" with Extra Texture.Woffinden, p. 86. Harrison's late 1974 projects had also resulted in a fall from his previous position of \\"considerable public and commercial favor\\", according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44. Leng maintains that this loss of prestige influenced Harrison's choosing to include three obviously commercial tracks that were \\"designed to rehabilitate [his] pop status\\":Leng, p. 186. the 1971 Ronnie Spector outtake \\"You\\";Spizer, p. 342. a tribute to soul singer Smokey Robinson, \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\";Clayson, p. 358. and \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\". As another contributing factor behind what Beatles biographers such as Rodriguez, Woffinden and Chris Ingham recognise as an expedient, rushed approach to making Extra Texture, Harrison wished to record the album quickly and so end his commitments to Apple,Woffinden, pp. 85‚Äì86. before signing with A&M-distributed; Dark Horse Records.Clayson, p. 348.Rodriguez, pp. 247‚Äì48, 280. In addition, studio time became available at A&M;'s recording facility when he was in Los Angeles in April 1975;Madinger & Easter, p. 451. and, in one of his Dark Horse acts, the band Attitudes, he already had backing musicians on hand.Leng, pp. 178‚àí79. \\"The haste was almost unseemly\\", Leng writes of the apparent commercial considerations behind Harrison's 1975 album, such that it would be \\"the first of his releases to lack passion\\".Leng, pp. 178, 187. Harrison taped the basic track for \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" at A&M; Studios in Hollywood on 1 May. One of many piano-based songs on Extra Texture,Huntley, pp. 122‚Äì23. the recording features three keyboard players ‚Äì Nicky Hopkins (piano), Attitudes member David Foster (Fender Rhodes electric piano) and Gary Wright (ARP synthesizer).Spizer, p. 274. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that Hopkins may have taped his contribution at a separate session. Harrison and Jesse Ed Davis played electric guitar on the song, while the rhythm section comprised Attitudes drummer Jim Keltner and Harrison's friend Klaus Voormann on bass. Leng describes the musical arrangement as \\"[aping] the currently fashionable Philly Soul sound\\" through the use of \\"lush strings, pop-gospel chord sequences, and richly worked backup vocals\\".Leng, p. 184. Harrison later conceded that the song was \\"very commercial\\" and stated that he had envisioned it recorded by English singer Joe Cocker, to whom he originally gave \\"Something\\" in March 1969.Clayson, pp. 250‚Äì51. In the same radio interview with Gambaccini, Harrison claimed that with his lead vocal on \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\", he was attempting to imitate John Lennon, adding: \\"It was hard to sing that first chorus, I tell you.\\" For the backing vocals, Harrison worked with Paul Stallworth, the lead singer of Attitudes, to create what Leng identifies as his \\"most intricate\\" vocal arrangement since producing Splinter's debut album, The Place I Love, over 1973‚Äì74. Foster arranged and conducted a nineteen-piece orchestral string section for the track on 6 June at A&M.; Madinger and Easter write that horn overdubs took place on 2‚Äì3 June, played by Tom Scott and Chuck Findley, yet only the string orchestration appears on the released recording.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 375. Release Often viewed as Harrison's \\"soul album\\",Leng, p. 180.Clayson, pp. 348‚Äì49.Rodriguez, p. 385. Extra Texture (Read All About It) was released in September 1975,Badman, p. 169. just nine months after Dark Horse.Schaffner, pp. 182, 212. \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" appeared as track 2 on side two of the original LP format,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 369. segued with the side-opening \\"A Bit More of You\\". Leng writes that the purpose of the latter track, a 45-second instrumental portion of the Motown-inspired \\"You\\", was to \\"fashion a soul mood\\" for \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\".Leng, pp. 180, 184. With \\"You\\" an obvious choice for the album's lead single, \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" had the qualities required to be the follow-up, Leng and Allison opine. Instead, \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\", Harrison's rebuttal to his 1974 critics,Inglis, p. 51.Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 10 October 2014). was released as a second single from Extra Texture, in December 1975.Spizer, p. 277. Reception A number of critics singled out the song as a highlight of the album.Allison, p. 138. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Both 'Can't Stop Thinking About You' and 'Tired of Midnight Blue' ... are well done. Free from dogma ... they provide the most effective nine minutes of music Harrison's made since his solo career began.\\"Dave Marsh, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975, p. 75 (retrieved 22 April 2013). Ray Coleman of Melody Maker admired Keltner's drumming and the lead vocal part, which he said demonstrated \\"a texture to George's voice which hasn't often been heard\\". Coleman said that each of the album's tracks could \\"stand alone as a single\\" and identified \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" as a \\"goodie\\" that improved through repeated listening.Ray Coleman, \\"Extra Texture: Back to the Sixties!\\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 30. Among more recent reviewers, Paul Du Noyer, writing for Blender magazine in 2004, grouped the song with \\"You\\" and \\"This Guitar\\" as the three \\"standout tracks\\" on Extra Texture.Paul Du Noyer, \\"Back Catalogue: George Harrison\\", Blender, April 2004, pp. 152‚Äì53. While considering the album to be \\"almost entirely weary in tone, amounting to a prolonged buzz kill\\", Robert Rodriguez writes: \\"Isolated from the morose surroundings on this LP, ['Can't Stop Thinking About You'] could have really shone, but here it simply prolongs the tedium.\\" Chris Ingham pairs the song with \\"Ooh Baby\\" as examples of Harrison's \\"threadbare\\" compositions on Extra Texture and the \\"slick playing\\" found throughout the album.Ingham, p. 134. More impressed, Beatles compiler Bruce Spizer describes \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" as a \\"beautiful mid-tempo love song\\", while Elliot Huntley admires it as \\"one of the best songs George ever wrote ... right up there with 'Something'\\".Huntley, pp. 125‚Äì26. \\"It's one of those songs where everything comes together\\", Huntley continues, before listing attributes such as Nicky Hopkins' \\"elegant piano\\" and Harrison's \\"exquisite\\" vocals. Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Extra Texture, Joe Marchese of The Second Disc deems it to be a track that \\"happily reflected his newfound bliss with Olivia\\".Joe Marchese, \\"Review: The George Harrison Remasters ‚Äì 'The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975'\\", The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 10 October 2014). Tom Doyle, writing for Mojo magazine, describes Harrison as \\"sound[ing] depressed, if R&B-soulful;\\" on Extra Texture, with \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" \\"pre-echoing the boozy laments\\" of John Martyn's 1980 album Grace and Danger.Tom Doyle, \\"Hari Styles: George Harrison The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 109. Ian Inglis is dismissive of the \\"repetitive nature\\" of the lyrics and an \\"equally repetitive\\" melody. Noting that \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" lacks the compositional strengths that make such repetition an \\"effective musical device\\", Inglis concludes: \\"what might have been intended as a pop anthem only manages to become an inconsequential album track.\\" Simon Leng is similarly negative of Harrison's \\"aims to please\\", and writes: \\"No song on Extra Texture speaks more of the need to be commercially acceptable than 'Can't Stop Thinking About You,' Harrison's most obvious new pop cut since 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long.' Here he is positively desperate to reach for insignificance ...\\" Leng describes the track as \\"pop-soul fluff\\" and adds: \\"The song was obviously written to be a single, which makes it doubly puzzling that it wasn't released as one.\\" Personnel *George Harrison ‚Äì vocals, electric guitar, backing vocals *Nicky Hopkins ‚Äì piano *David Foster ‚Äì electric piano, string arrangement *Jesse Ed Davis ‚Äì electric guitar *Gary Wright ‚Äì ARP synthesizer *Klaus Voormann ‚Äì bass *Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums *uncredited ‚Äì tambourine *Paul Stallworth ‚Äì backing vocals Notes References Sources * Dale C.

It was written after a night out with music-industry executives in Los Angeles ‚Äì an event that Harrison found particularly depressing. The recording includes contributions from Leon Russell, on piano, and Jim Keltner, who plays drums and percussion. Along with the hit single \\"You\\", \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\" is one of the few songs on Extra Texture that has consistently been received with favour by music critics and reviewers. Writing for Classic Rock magazine, Paul Trynka describes it as \\"a beautifully constructed lament to a tedious night out\\". Background Since the early 1970s, George Harrison regularly spent part of spring and summer each year in Los Angeles, the recognised capital of the music industry worldwide.Clayson, pp. 320‚Äì21. In 1971, he produced Ravi Shankar's Raga soundtrack album there, as well as recording his and Shankar's Bangladesh benefit singles.Badman, pp. 36, 38.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 103, 107. In 1973, he worked with Shankar once more, on Shankar Family & Friends, at A&M; Studios in Hollywood, before going on to make guest appearances on albums by Ringo Starr (Ringo), Cheech & Chong (Los Cochinos) and Dave Mason (It's Like You Never Left) at Sunset Sound and other studios around town.Leng, pp. 140‚Äì41.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 126, 128, 139.Badman, p. 92. When visiting him in Malibu in April 1971, Harrison's friend Chris O'Dell had found him lonely and keen to escape the hangers-on associated with the LA rock world,O'Dell, pp. 186, 188‚Äì89. just as Klaus Voormann has noted that installing a state-of-the-art studio at his Friar Park home would allow Harrison to do the same from the London music scene.Leng, pp. 148‚Äì49. The 1973 visit saw Harrison indulging in more traditional rock-star pursuits,Badman, p. 102. the Cheech & Chong session \\"morally ... a bit shaky\\", biographer Alan Clayson has suggested,Clayson, p. 330. so beginning a period Harrison himself termed as his \\"naughty\\" years;Harrison, p. 274. Voormann called it a \\"step back\\".Klaus Voormann interview, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD (Disc 2), Village Roadshow, 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese). By March 1975, still \\"reeling\\" from the \\"barbarous reaction\\" to both his 1974 tour with Shankar and the Dark Horse album, according to musical biographer Simon Leng, Harrison was back in Los Angeles, this time as the head of his own independent record label.Leng, pp. 178, 179. Dark Horse Records had recently signed a handful of new acts in Jiva, Stairsteps and Attitudes, all of whom were American-based,Clayson, pp. 347‚Äì48. a reality that meant Harrison was domiciled in California with girlfriend Olivia Arias all through the summer.Leng, p. 179. Composition and recording A much-in-demand session musician, Klaus Voormann recalls of this period in Los Angeles: \\"It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture ... I realised that it was the whole Hollywood thing ‚Äì the problem was that if you wanted to stay in that scene, you had to hang out with those people, and go and do the clubs ... George was in it too far at the time, and it was a good step of his to get out of it.\\" Harrison would later credit his prolonged bout of hepatitis in early 1976 as the reason he quit heavy drinking,Clayson, p. 359. but as an industry boss in the spring of 1975, he too found himself in the LA clubs. One such night left him \\"depressed by what I saw going on there\\", as he put it in his autobiography, when discussing the song \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\".Harrison, p. 308. Over a \\"smoky, bluesy\\" musical backing,Leng, p. 185. the song's first verse and chorus outline his thoughts upon returning home to his lover after the night in question, as a new day is just beginning: Musically, over the \\"along with you / Tired of midnight blue\\" lines of the choruses, the song drops from what author Alan Clayson terms its \\"'Badge'-style rhythmic lope\\",Clayson, p. 349. propelled by Harrison's strong seventh chords on soul- inflected rhythm guitar and Jim Keltner's drums and cowbell, to reveal sweeping \\"tumbleweed\\" piano from Leon RussellLeng, pp. 184‚Äì85. and a rare Extra Texture slide-guitar commentary from Harrison. The second verse then describes the morning progressing, and with it an increased clarity of mind: By the final verse, the sun is setting and the moon now rises. \\"Way up, the clouds told me that they knew,\\" Harrison sings before recognising the truth reflected in his lover: \\"And as you smiled, I knew that you knew too.\\" While discussing the song with BBC Radio 1's Paul Gambaccini that September,Badman, pp. 164, 165. Harrison praised Russell's \\"fantastic\\" piano contributionGeorge Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 10 July 2012). after introducing the track with a laconic \\"You know those nights you go out and wish you hadn't? It's one of those ...\\"George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 10 July 2012). \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\" was recorded on 21 April that year, again at A&M; Studios,Spizer, p. 275. as \\"Midnight Blue\\"; the title was subsequently altered once Melissa Manchester had a hit with a song of that name over the summer.  Release and reception  \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\" was issued on Extra Texture (Read All About It) in September 1975 and was one of the few songs on the album to garner positive reviews. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone described it as \\"well done\\" and \\"cryptic in the manner of 'Blue Jay Way'\\". Together with \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\", it provided, in Marsh's words, \\"the most effective nine minutes of music Harrison's made since his solo career began. 'Midnight Blue' even features some of the guitar work Harrison so assiduously avoids elsewhere.\\"Dave Marsh, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975, p. 75 (retrieved 16 May 2012). While viewing Extra Texture as predominantly \\"mournful and doom-laden\\", the NMEs Neil Spencer wrote: \\"'Tired Of Midnight Blue' makes more constructive use of Hari finding his heart in his boots. There's a tune, some moderately tricksy chord changes and a refreshing simplicity in sight. The relative sparsity gives Leon Russell the chance to play some charming tumbledown piano, George meshes some crisp rhythm guitar against his own lead; and it works.\\"Neil Spencer, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture (Apple)\\", NME, 20 September 1975, p. 23.Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 103. More recently, Seattle-based critic\\"Chaz Lipp\\", The Morton Report (retrieved 6 October 2014). Chaz Lipp writes that \\"The [album's] essential cut is the grooving 'Tired of Midnight Blue.'\\"Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison‚Äôs Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 6 October 2014). New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid similarly opines: \\"The best track might just be the moody Tired of Midnight Blue, in which [Harrison] admits to getting weary of indulging himself in nightclub 'naughtiness' and just wanting to be back home. He fills it with dog-tiredness and a sense of self-loathing.\\"Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). In another 2014 review, for Classic Rock magazine, Paul Trynka describes the track as \\"a beautifully constructed lament to a tedious night out\\" and includes it among the album's \\"confessional songs that have worn well\\".Paul Trynka, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years 1968‚Äì75\\", Classic Rock, November 2014, p. 105 (retrieved 29 November 2014). Although he sees it as one of a number of tunes on Extra Texture that are \\"almost watered-down flashbacks to The Beatles\\", Alan Clayson opines: \\"In its contradiction of enjoyable depression, only 'Tired of Midnight Blue' passed muster.\\"Clayson, pp. 349‚Äì50. On an album containing songs that he views as either \\"threadbare\\" or \\"medium-grade self- pastiche\\", author Chris Ingham writes that \\"[t]hings look up during Tired Of Midnight Blue, a sassy soft-shoe shuffle ... [and] on His Name Is Legs (Ladies And Gentlemen).\\"Ingham, pp. 134‚Äì35. In his overview of Harrison's first decade as a solo artist, David Cavanagh of Uncut admires the song as \\"this LP's 'Beware Of Darkness' ‚Äì i.e. where did he get those chords?\\"David Cavanagh, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse\\", Uncut, August 2008, p. 47. Simon Leng identifies \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\" as the \\"only piece that really worked from every angle\\" and, aside from the album's lead single, \\"You\\", \\"the best song on Extra Texture\\".Leng, pp. 184, 186. Leng describes it as \\"an introvert's rejection of the 'rock'n'roll' life\\" and the \\"reaction\\" to Dark Horse's \\"tale of booze and birds\\" that was \\"Simply Shady\\".Leng, p. 184. Pointing to the way ahead in Harrison's career, Leng continues, \\"['Tired of Midnight Blue'] summarises George's intention to head back to his English garden and the comfort of family life.\\" Personnel * George Harrison ‚Äì vocals, electric guitar, slide guitars, backing vocals * Leon Russell ‚Äì piano * Paul Stallworth ‚Äì bass * Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums, cowbell, handclaps References Sources * Dale C.

","title":"Tired of Midnight Blue"},{"id":"34610205","text":"\\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1975 album Extra Texture (Read All About It). Harrison wrote it in 1973 during a period that he characterised as his \\"naughty\\" years, coinciding with the failure of his marriage to Pattie Boyd and his divergence from the ascetic path of his Hindu-aligned faith. He returned to the song two years later when filled with despondency and self-doubt in response to the scathing reviews that his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and Dark Horse album had received from several music critics. Harrison recorded \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" in Los Angeles at a time when his disenchantment was increased through excessive use of cocaine. The track typifies the sombre, keyboard-oriented sound of Extra Texture, in comparison with the multitracked guitars typical of Harrison's previous work as a solo artist. Aside from musical contributions by David Foster, Jesse Ed Davis and Jim Keltner, the recording features Harrison playing various parts on ARP and Moog synthesizers. The song has received unfavourable comments from several reviewers, and particularly from some of Harrison's spiritual biographers. One of these, Dale Allison, describes the track as a \\"relentlessly despondent offering\\", while author Ian Inglis views it as a song of \\"great charm, energy, and beauty\\".Inglis, p. 141. Background George Harrison said he wrote \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" in 1973 on an upright piano in the hall of his Oxfordshire home, Friar Park,Harrison, p. 274. about eighteen months before its release in September 1975. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, he attributes the song to his \\"naughty\\" period of 1973‚Äì74, when he indulged in rock star-type excess in response to the failure of his marriage to Pattie Boyd.Leng, p. 159.Carol Clerk, \\"George Harrison 1943‚Äì2001\\", Uncut, January 2002, p. 55; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). This behaviour marked a deviation from the spiritual path he had espoused on his 1973 album Living in the Material World. Having recently purchased Bhaktivedanta Manor in Hertfordshire for the Hare Krishna movement,Tillery, pp. 111, 162. Harrison visited their leader, Swami Prabhupada, at the property in August 1973 and shared his doubts.Greene, pp. 198‚Äì200. Harrison told Prabhupada that he feared alienating his loved ones through his commitment, and that he alternated between long periods of devotion to Krishna and others when he \\"turn[ed] into a demon again\\".Greene, pp. 200‚Äì01, 202. Harrison reaffirmed his commitment while visiting India in early 1974,Allison, p. 147. when he also planned a joint concert tour with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar for later that year.Leng, pp. 148, 157. The tour was the first in North America by a member of the Beatles since the band's visit in August 1966,Spizer, p. 259. and the only major tour Harrison would undertake as a solo artist.Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, p. 199.Inglis, pp. 49, 107. Harrison had been keen to present rock audiences with a new concert experienceClayson, p. 339.Rodriguez, Solo in the 70s, p. i. ‚Äì one that blended Shankar's Music Festival from India orchestra with his own, jazz-funk inspired musical direction,Lavezzoli, p. 196. while also promoting a Krishna- conscious message.Tillery, pp. 113‚Äì14. Instead, the tour frustrated music critics and fans who were nostalgic for the Beatles,Leng, p. 166. and many reviewers were scathing in their assessment of the concerts.Schaffner, p. 178.Greene, pp. 214‚Äì15. Chief among these detractors was Rolling Stone magazine,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44.David Cavanagh, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse\\", Uncut, August 2008, pp. 43‚Äì44. which, amid what author Elliot Huntley terms the \\"tsunami of bile\\" unleashed on Harrison following the tour,Huntley, p. 114. used its review of his delayed Dark Horse album to attack him personally and as an artist.Leng, pp. 174‚Äì75. Writing in the 2002 Rolling Stone Press tribute book Harrison, Mikal Gilmore said that Harrison felt \\"battered\\" as a result of this critical mauling, which, combined with the failure of his marriage in 1974, led to a period of depression.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 46. Harrison returned to the United States in February 1975Badman, p. 151. to oversee projects by artists signed to his Dark Horse record label in Los Angeles, and in order to spend time with his new girlfriend, Olivia Arias, in her hometown.Inglis, p. 50.Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, p. 247. Having not written any songs since the previous October, he revisited \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\", together with some other old or unfinished compositions, for inclusion on a new album, titled Extra Texture (Read All About It).Madinger & Easter, p. 451. With regard to \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" and the similarly downbeatAllison, pp. 7‚Äì8, 159.Tillery, pp. 116‚Äì17. \\"World of Stone\\", Arias recalls that Harrison \\"was being very hard on himself at that time\\".Kevin Howlett's liner notes, Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 6. Composition Although in his autobiography he makes light of the song's significance,Allison, p. 22. during a 1987 interview with Musician magazine,Clayson, pp. 348, 474. Harrison said he was \\"in a real down place\\" when making Extra Texture.Huntley, p. 128. In September 1975, during his track-by-track discussion of the album with BBC Radio 1's Paul Gambaccini,Badman, pp. 164, 165. he described \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" as \\"one of those depressing, 4 o'clock in the morning sort of songs\\".George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 4 October 2017). Harrison biographers Simon Leng, Dale Allison and Gary Tillery each view the composition as alarmingly direct in its depiction of the singer's despair.Allison, p. 7.Tillery, p. 116.Leng, pp. 185, 186, 228. Leng identifies a similarity between the song's opening sequence of chords and those in Billy Preston's 1969 single \\"That's the Way God Planned It\\", which Harrison produced for the Beatles' Apple record label, yet \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" is \\"emotionally a million miles away from that stirring gospel mood\\".Leng, pp. 59‚Äì61, 185. The first verse sets the tone for what Leng describes as \\"an uncomfortable few minutes\\":Leng, p. 185. Harrison quoted these words in his interview with Gambaccini, to illustrate the point that \\"after talking for a lot, you know, sometimes it's nice to be quiet\\". The depiction of human life as a battlefield is an allegory commonly associated with the ancient Hindu text Bhagavad Gita, in which the warrior-prince Arjuna is counselled by Krishna in the form of a charioteer.Tillery, p. 78. The same theme appears in Harrison's songs from the early 1970s, beginning with \\"Let It Down\\".Leng, pp. 90, 130, 185. Arjuna and Krishna in a scene from the Bhagavad Gita. In his lyrics to the song, Harrison refers to the \\"battlefield\\" aspect of life but expresses a desire to retreat from an Arjuna-like role in the conflict. Author Ian Inglis says that the song's slowly descending melody \\"parallels [Harrison's] personal descent into an aimless and isolated existence\\".Inglis, p. 53. Common to Harrison compositions such as \\"Who Can See It\\" and \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\",Leng, pp. 129, 154. its time signature shifts during the verses, implying missed beats within a bar. Harrison told Gambaccini that this rhythmic effect particularly interested him about \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\". Inglis comments on Harrison's use of words such as \\"padlock\\" and \\"fight\\" to \\"immediately conjure images of imprisonment that convey the repressive nature of his life\\".Inglis, pp. 53‚Äì54. Another example is the word \\"pistol\\", in verse two:Inglis, p. 54. Interpretation of the \\"pistol at my brain\\" lyric varies among Harrison's biographers. While Leng and Inglis observe that the singer appears to have courted death and even contemplated suicide, Allison, a Christian theologian, attaches significant importance to the line, on an album that he identifies as \\"the anomaly\\" in Harrison's solo work, due to the absence of \\"positive theological statements\\" in any of the songs.Allison, pp. 7, 8. According to Allison: \\"['Grey Cloudy Lies'] documents the dreadful temptation to commit suicide ... It is natural to guess that the absence of God from the lyrics of Extra Texture mirrors a perceived absence of God in George's personal life; and the emptiness was so intensely troubling that it fostered, at least momentarily, thoughts of taking his own life.\\"Allison, p. 7. Joshua Greene, another religious academic and an ISKCON devotee, instead interprets the song as part of its parent album's \\"modest appeal for tolerance\\". \\"No longer an Arjuna,\\" Greene writes of Harrison's deliberate \\"religious restraint\\" on Extra Texture, \\"all George wanted now was to leave the battlefield behind and simply live 'with no pistol at my brain'.\\"Greene, p. 221. Tillery cites the same line as an example of \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\"' place as the \\"darkest\\" of the \\"downbeat tracks\\" found on most of the album. Tillery also highlights the hopelessness implicit in the song's final verse, where Harrison states he only wants to live \\"with no teardrops in my eyes\\", yet \\"at times there seems like no chance\\". The song title appears only at the end of this third verse, within the couplet \\"No clear blue skies / Grey cloudy lies\\". Among other Harrison songs of the 1970s, Leng sees thematic parallels between this composition and two Dark Horse tracks that deal with the end of Harrison's marriage to Boyd: \\"So Sad\\" and \\"Bye Bye, Love\\".Leng, pp. 152, 156, 207. These three songs, Leng continues, constitute a cycle of \\"sheer unhappiness\\" in the singer's life that was only alleviated by the positive presence of Arias,Leng, p. 207. who, following their marriage in 1978, remained Harrison's life partner until his death in November 2001.Tillery, pp. 115, 120.Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, pp. 424‚Äì45. Leng also compares \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" to the posthumously released \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\", which he terms the lyrical \\"blood brother\\" to this 1975 song, due to its \\"harrowing\\" description of the cancer that would claim Harrison's life.Leng, pp. 300‚Äì01. Recording Harrison recorded \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" in Los Angeles, while immersed in the city's music-business scene ‚Äì and with it, author Robert Rodriguez notes, \\"LA's 1970s drug culture\\"Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, p. 85. ‚Äì during the spring and summer of 1975.Leng, p. 179. Harrison's role as owner of A&M-distributed; Dark Horse Records saw him overseeing projects there by new signings Attitudes, Stairsteps and Henry McCullough,Clayson, pp. 347‚Äì48. as well as socialising in circles that he admitted to finding depressing.Huntley, p. 126. Harrison's friend since the Beatles' Hamburg years, German bassist Klaus Voormann, has spoken of the abundance of drugs at the sessions, particularly cocaine.Sounes, p. 320.Leng, pp. 56, 179. He said of Harrison: \\"I didn't like his frame of mind when he was doing this album ‚Äì I don't play on it too much.\\" The recording features various parts played by Harrison on an ARP synthesizer. Harrison taped the basic track for \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" at A&M; Studios in Hollywood on 24 April 1975.Madinger & Easter, p. 453. The line-up on the track was Harrison on electric guitar; David Foster on piano; Jesse Ed Davis on Leslie-effected guitar, played through a wah-wah pedal; Voormann on bass; and drummer Jim Keltner, another regular participant at Harrison recording sessions.Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, pp. 79, 81. In their book Eight Arms to Hold You, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that Foster may have added his piano part during the album's overdubbing phase, however, between 31 May and 6 June.Madinger & Easter, pp. 451, 453. According to author Bruce Spizer, Harrison was dissatisfied with Voormann's contribution,Spizer, p. 275. and so replaced it with a bass part he performed himself on Moog synthesizer. The song also features ARP synthesizer extensively, played by Harrison.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 196. Dated 23 June, the album's master-reel tracking sheet lists separate ARP horn, string and \\"growl\\" tracks on \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\", in addition to handclaps.\\"24-track tape from Extra Texture sessions [master reel information]\\", Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 5. The dominance of keyboards on the recording, particularly ARP synthesizer,Huntley, p. 127. was typical of Harrison's choice of instrumentation on Extra TextureLeng, pp. 179‚Äì80, 186. and contrasts with what Rodriguez terms \\"the standard guitar-drenched Harrison sound\\".Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, p. 385. In his comments to Gambaccini, Harrison said that he purposefully left space in the arrangement for this and other songs on the album. He also acknowledged that this approach differed from the sound he had achieved earlier in the 1970s, especially in his work with producer Phil Spector. Inglis comments on the track's \\"dramatic\\" introduction and a \\"top- heavy\\" production that anticipates the power ballad style adopted by Whitney Houston and others during the 1980s. Release and reception The song was sequenced as the penultimate track on Extra Texture (Read All About It),Spizer, p. 273. between \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\" and \\"His Name Is Legs\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 635. The release took place on 22 September 1975 in the United States and early October in Britain.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 369. Although the cover of Melody Maker carried a headline declaring \\"George Bounces Back!\\",Badman, p. 164. many reviewers bemoaned the album's preponderance of melancholic ballads such as \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\".Clayson, pp. 348‚Äì49.Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ 2.0, pp. 184, 248, 385. According to author Nicholas Schaffner, \\"even his disciples tended to find the music plodding and aimless.\\"Schaffner, p. 182. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone noted the lack of religious references in the album's lyrics before adding: \\"But 'Grey Cloudy Lies' makes up in its cathectic repetition of Krishna homiletics for whatever the others have skipped ... Witless and ponderous as any previous hymn to the godhead, they drag Extra Texture down with them after its brief flurry of excitement.\\"Dave Marsh, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975, p. 75 (retrieved 9 March 2013). In Melody Maker, Ray Coleman said the album was a \\"lovely collection of songs by a musician with integrity\\" and that \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" was \\"perhaps the most difficult of all the tracks to grab hold of\\" on initial listening. He also highlighted the song's \\"unusual chords\\" and the \\"especially pretty\\" piano part.Ray Coleman, \\"Extra Texture: Back to the Sixties!\\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 30. Retrospective assessment Among Harrison's biographers, Simon Leng comments on \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\": \\"Even though Leonard Cohen and, later, the Smiths made a living from songs about depression, the justification for recording a piece like this on what was ostensibly an entertainment product is questionable. This is one of the few Harrisongs that would have been better left in the can.\\" Dale Allison writes: \\"A profoundly depressing meditation on despair and suicide ‚Ä¶ One has trouble imagining anyone enjoying it.\\"Allison, p. 143. Elliot Huntley considers the problem to be the musical arrangement rather than the composition itself, and laments how the Moog and ARP synthesizers \\"seem to soak the song\\". Writing for the music website Something Else!, Nick DeRiso opines that, with Extra Texture, Harrison \\"couldn't have strayed further from his religious moorings ‚Äì or from the free-spirited uplift that made his initial post-Beatles projects such pleasant surprises\\", and he dismisses \\"Grey Cloudy Lies\\" as \\"one of [the album's] most wrist-slashingly awful songs\\".Nick DeRiso, \\"Gimme Five: Solo Beatles records that, well, sucked\\", Something Else!, 27 September 2012 (retrieved 4 May 2015). Ian Inglis offers a favourable assessment, describing it as one of Harrison's \\"simplest and most poignant\\" compositions, and a song of \\"great charm, energy, and beauty\\" with lyrics that have \\"the status and structure of a poem\\".Inglis, pp. 53, 141. Inglis concludes: \\"Despite the inappropriate production, Harrison gives a memorable performance of a beautiful song, whose absolute honesty is reminiscent of the music of Leonard Cohen and Townes Van Zandt.\\" Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Extra Texture, for Paste magazine, Robert Ham views \\"the desperate 'Grey Cloudy Lies'\\" as a \\"[moment] when Harrison's focus returns\\", and a ballad that \\"cut[s] deep\\".Robert Ham, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years: 1968‚Äì1975 Review\\", Paste, 24 September 2014 (retrieved 3 October 2014). Shawn Perry of vintagerock.com considers the track to be a highlight of \\"a creative and introspective album that's aged well\\", and \\"a song that, despite its solemn, down-trodden lyrics, resonates with a level of reflection that somehow makes you feel everything is going to be OK\\".Shawn Perry, \\"George Harrison The Apple Years 1968‚Äì75 ‚Äì Boxset Review\\", vintagerock.com, October 2014 (retrieved 4 May 2015). In his review for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka similarly opines that this and other \\"confessional songs\\" on Extra Texture have \\"worn well\\". Trynka continues: \\"['Grey Cloudy Lies' is] a dark exploration of the depression into which he'd sunk in 1974, after being mocked for his spiritual homilies. Today, when pop stars swig Cristal and flash their pecs on Instagram, we can appreciate the irony of Harrison being attacked for preaching enlightenment.\\"Paul Trynka, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years 1968‚Äì75\\", Classic Rock, November 2014, p. 105 (retrieved 29 November 2014).

Category:Indian mythology in music ","title":"Grey Cloudy Lies"},{"id":"34610209","text":"\\"His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)\\" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison, released in 1975 as the closing track of his album Extra Texture (Read All About It). The song is a tribute to \\"Legs\\" Larry Smith, the drummer with the 1960s satirical-comedy group the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and one of many comedians with whom Harrison began associating during the 1970s. Smith appears on the recording, delivering a spoken monologue, while Harrison's lyrics similarly reflect the comedian's penchant for zany wordplay. The song serves as a precursor to Harrison's work with Monty Python members Eric Idle and Michael Palin, including his production of the troupe's 1975 single \\"The Lumberjack Song\\" and films such as Life of Brian (1979) that he produced under the aegis of his company HandMade Films. Harrison recorded \\"His Name Is Legs\\" at his Friar Park home studio during sessions for his 1974 album Dark Horse. The song remained unfinished until he returned to it the following year while working in Los Angeles on Extra Texture. Aside from Harrison and Smith, the musicians on the recording include Tom Scott, Billy Preston, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark, all of whom were part of Harrison's 1974 tour band. The song's arrangement reflects Harrison's adoption of the funk genre. As with the album's humorous artwork, the inclusion of \\"His Name Is Legs\\" on Extra Texture marked a rare example of light-heartedness among a collection of mostly downbeat songs. Several commentators view the track as an indulgence by Harrison. These detractors cite the in-joke nature of the composition, together with the largely unintelligible vocals on the recording. Harrison acknowledged that the song's appeal might be limited to \\"maybe two people\\". Background The Bonzos' Vivian Stanshall and drummer \\"Legs\\" Larry Smith in 1969 Although often noted for the serious, religious nature of his song lyrics,Allison, pp. 36‚Äì37. George Harrison was an avowed fan of British comedy, beginning with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan's work in The Goon Show during the 1950s.Clayson, p. 271. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison writes of comedy ‚Äì specifically, Monty Python's first TV series and the satirical Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band ‚Äì as having \\"filled that empty space for me\\" in the late 1960s, when relationships with his Beatles bandmates had fractured.Doggett, pp. 43‚Äì45, 59‚Äì61.MacDonald, p. 300. The Bonzo Dog Band (as they became known in 1969) were a favourite of the Beatles,Huntley, p. 127. who cast the group in their 1967 TV film Magical Mystery Tour.Inglis, p. 54. Harrison subsequently performed with the Bonzos' drummer, \\"Legs\\" Larry Smith, along with Eric Clapton and other members of Delaney & Bonnie and Friends,Clayson, pp. 282, 350. at John Lennon's \\"Peace for Christmas\\" charity concert,Leng, p. 67. held at London's Lyceum Ballroom in December 1969.Miles, p. 362. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison suggests an alternative scenario to the Beatles' 1970 break-up: \\"What should have happened is that the Bonzos and the Beatles ... turned into one great Rutle band with all the Pythons and had a laugh.\\"George Harrison, pp. 64‚Äì65. By 1973, SellersClayson, pp. 333‚Äì34. and MilliganOlivia Harrison, pp. 322, 362. were among the comedians who formed part of Harrison's social circle at his Friar Park estate in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.Carol Clerk, \\"George Harrison 1943‚Äì2001\\", Uncut, February 2002, p. 56; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). This period coincided with the end of his marriage to Pattie Boyd,Doggett, pp. 208‚Äì09. who has described their home as \\"a madhouse\\" during their final year together.Boyd, p. 175. Harrison became reacquainted with Smith through longtime Beatles aide Terry Doran.Clayson, p. 350. Harrison admired Smith as \\"a wonderfully eccentric person\\", a quality that had similarly inspired him about Sir Frank Crisp,Boyd, pp. 144, 163. the original owner of Friar Park.Clayson, pp. 300‚Äì01.Greene, pp. 165‚Äì66. Author Dale Allison suggests that Smith became a court jester figure for Harrison,Allison, p. 144. who wrote the song \\"His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)\\" as a tribute to Smith. In his autobiography, Harrison terms the composition \\"a piece of personal indulgence, like some other of my songs about things nobody else knows or cares about, except maybe two people\\". Composition Harrison wrote \\"His Name Is Legs\\" around Christmastime in 1973, on a piano at Friar Park. Author Ian Inglis describes it as a song \\"peppered with oblique references and in-jokes about [Smith's] idiosyncratic mannerisms and behavior\\". Harrison's lyrics incorporate some of Smith's favourite sayings, the first verse beginning:George Harrison, pp. 303, 304. Examples of Smith's penchant for zany wordplay include the lines \\"Never over-sits he under-stands\\" and \\"Get lined up come Sikh come Czar\\" ‚Äì the latter being partly a misappropriation of the French phrase \\"comme ci comme √ßa\\". In the second verse, the line \\"People think he's loopy loo when they look at his shoes\\" refers to the comedian's unusual dress sense, which included \\"toy cows grazing on his shoes\\", according to Harrison biographer Alan Clayson, while \\"rocking sausage roll\\" was Smith's phrase for rock 'n' roll. The song title appears in the two bridge sections, the first of which states:George Harrison, p. 307. Musically, the composition is in the funk rock style,Leng, p. 186. while the device of introducing Smith to listeners recalls the show tune aspect of Harrison's collaboration with Mal Evans, \\"You and Me (Babe)\\",Inglis, pp. 54, 56. which closed former Beatle Ringo Starr's 1973 album Ringo.Rodriguez, p. 35. In the lyrics to \\"His Name Is Legs\\", Harrison biographer Simon Leng recognises the same \\"nonsense word games\\" favoured by Monty Python. Leng comments that the latter's composition \\"The Lumberjack Song\\" particularly resonated with Harrison during this period, as he sought to challenge the public's perception of him as a Beatle, in the same way that Michael Palin's character in the Python song challenged the stereotypes associated with an \\"all-action\\" lumberjack.Leng, pp. 185‚Äì86. Recording =1974 basic track= Harrison taped \\"His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)\\" during sessions for his 1974 album Dark Horse,Spizer, p. 275. but it was one of a number of tracks he left unfinished.Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", CIrcus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).Kevin Hewlett, liner- note essay, Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 9. The sessions took place at his Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, in August‚ÄìSeptember that year,Leng, p. 147. with Phil McDonald as recording engineer.Madinger & Easter, pp. 442, 453. Harrison played piano and electric guitar on the recording;Leng, p. 185. the other musicians were Billy Preston (electric piano), Tom Scott (saxophones), Willie Weeks (bass) and Andy Newmark (drums).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 376. These four musicians then joined Harrison for tour rehearsals in Los Angeles,Olivia Harrison, pp. 298‚Äì99. where he rushed to complete Dark Horse before undertaking a much- anticipated North American tour with Ravi Shankar.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 44, 126.Lavezzoli, pp. 195‚Äì96. With Peter Sellers among his entourage,Clayson, p. 340. Harrison alternatively adopted comedy and his Hindu-aligned spiritual goals as a defence against expectations related to his Beatle past during the tour.Ben Fong-Torres, \\"George Harrison: Harrison in the Haight\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 2 December 2001; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). When discussing \\"His Name Is Legs\\" with BBC Radio 1 DJ Paul Gambaccini in September 1975, Harrison said that after recording the basic track, he invited Smith to sing the first two lines of each of the bridges. Smith did these vocal parts in two takes, and improvised dialogue through the rest of the song each time. In Clayson's description, Smith sang the bridge sections in English \\"officer-and-gentleman tones\\" and adopted an American accent for the monologues. =1975 overdubs= Harrison returned to the track in April 1975 when recording his album Extra Texture (Read All About It) at A&M; Studios in Los Angeles.Madinger & Easter, pp. 451, 453. The sessions coincided with a period that author Gary Tillery describes as a \\"spiritual funk\\" for Harrison,Tillery, p. 116. in reaction to scathing reviews for his 1974 tour and the Dark Horse album.Greene, pp. 213‚Äì15.Leng, pp. 178, 179. Harrison's despondency was alleviated by his new relationship with Olivia Arias,Tillery, pp. 115‚Äì16.Rodriguez, pp. 280, 384, 424. and a friendship begun with Monty Python star Eric IdleGeorge Harrison, p. 65. immediately after the Los Angeles premiere of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.Woffinden, p. 104. Idle has spoken of them sharing \\"a dialogue that went on for about 48 hours\\" following the premiere,George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD, Village Roadshow, 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese), Disc 2; event occurs between 59:20 and 59:29. which led to Harrison producing a re-recording of \\"The Lumberjack Song\\" in London, in October 1975,McCall, p. 44. for release as a UK single.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 194. The pair then wrote a comical sea shanty called \\"The Pirate Song\\"George Harrison, p. 314. for a sketch in Rutland Weekend Television, Idle's TV show with Neil Innes, Smith's former bandmate. Overdubs on the 1974 basic track for \\"His Name Is Legs\\" included tack piano, played by Canadian musician David Foster, and a new horn arrangement, played by Scott and Chuck Findley, another member of Harrison's tour band the previous year.Leng, p. 167. Scott and Findley recorded their contributions at A&M; Studios over 2‚Äì3 June,Madinger & Easter, p. 453. with each musician overdubbing two horn parts.George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 13 September 2013). The released recording begins with an introductory bass riff from Weeks, which is then joined by Foster's tack piano. Commentators note the lack of clarity in the mix,Rodriguez, p. 184. which author Elliot Huntley attributes to the \\"three-pronged piano attack\\" and the low level of Harrison and Smith's vocals.Huntley, pp. 127‚Äì28. At times during the sections featuring Smith's improvised dialogue, Harrison let both recorded takes run simultaneously, and he admitted to Gambaccini that he chose to mix the track in this way \\"so people have to strain with headphones to hear what it is\\".George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 13 September 2013).Badman, pp. 164, 165. Release and reception Inner sleeve for the Extra Texture LP; copyright Apple Records \\"His Name Is Legs\\" was released on 22 September 1975Castleman & Podrazik, p. 369. as the final track on Extra Texture (Read All About It).Spizer, p. 273. Together with Roy Kohara's album artwork, which \\"tried to incorporate a 'wacky' theme\\", according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter,Madinger & Easter, p. 451. the song's inclusion contrasted with the melancholic musical content of Extra Texture.Rodriguez, pp. 184, 385. The artwork included an inner-sleeve photo of Harrison \\"grin[ning] like a Monty Python choirboy\\", in the words of Village Voice critic Robert Christgau,Robert Christgau, \\"George Harrison > Consumer Guide Reviews\\", Robert Christgau (retrieved 11 September 2013). while the face labels credited production to \\"Ohnothimagen\\" (Oh, not him again)Huntley, p. 128. and showed the Apple Records logo reduced to an apple core.Doggett, p. 238.Spizer, pp. 275, 276. With the \\"Ohnothimagen\\" moniker, which also appeared below the LP's inner-sleeve photo and in advertising for the album, Harrison acknowledged his recent unpopularity with music critics.Leng, pp. 185, 189. While this gesture was intended as self-deprecation on Harrison's part, Smith has cited it as an example of Harrison's lack of confidence at the time and his need for \\"a cuddle now and then\\".David Cavanagh, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse\\", Uncut, August 2008, p. 48. Smith was listed in the performer credits as appearing \\"courtesy of the Oxfordshire County Council\\".Album credits, Extra Texture (Read All About It) LP (Apple Records, 1975; produced by George Harrison). Author Robert Rodriguez describes \\"His Name Is Legs\\" as a \\"comedy number\\" and \\"a self-indulgent in-joke\\" that appeared to show Harrison \\"doubling down on efforts to alienate his audience\\", after the bad press he had received over the winter of 1974‚Äì75.Rodriguez, pp. 184‚Äì85, 280. On release, Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone said that the song \\"might be Harrison's way of countering charges of humorlessness\\" but that \\"since neither Smith nor Harrison is very funny, it does more to confirm the charges.\\"Dave Marsh, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975, p. 75 (retrieved 11 September 2013). In the NME, Neil Spencer referred to the image of Harrison with \\"a chirpy smirk plastered across his dial\\" as \\"misleading\\", given the album's overall mood, and added: \\"'His Names Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)' is the odd track out because it's (ulp) not serious. It seems like an attempt to recapture some of the innocent light-heartedness of Beatle days.\\"Neil Spencer, \\"George Harrison: Extra Texture (Apple)\\", NME, 20 September 1975, p. 23.Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 103. Ray Coleman of Melody Maker predicted that Extra Texture would \\"re-establish [Harrison] as a powerful artist with an ear for unusual but attractive tunes allied to some quirky lyrics\\", and he described the closing song as an \\"up-tempo splash of fun, and it jumps, too\\".Ray Coleman, \\"Extra Texture: Back to the Sixties!\\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 30. In the 1978 edition of their book The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said that Harrison had \\"desperately\\" employed \\"last-minute devices\\" to save Extra Texture, by featuring \\"'zany' ex-Bonzo Dog Band drummer 'Legs' Larry Smith on a track, and by instructing his graphic designers to 'get a little humour into the packaging'. They do; and 'Legs' duly sings; but it is all too little, too late.\\"Carr & Tyler, p. 117. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden identified the song and the album art, as well as the single \\"You\\", as evidence that Harrison was attempting to re-engage with his listeners. Woffinden welcomed this approach but, noting the lack of a lyric sheet with the album, he added: \\"['His Name Is Legs'] is not a success, since most of the vocals are lost in the raucous mix; Larry might have had pearls of wisdom to impart, but who could tell?\\"Woffinden, p. 86. More recently, Richard Ginell of AllMusic has described the song as a \\"baffling salute\\" to Smith,Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", AllMusic (retrieved 6 July 2014). while former Mojo editor Mat Snow dismisses it as \\"a throwaway among throwaways\\".Snow, p. 52. Also writing for AllMusic, Lindsay Planer views \\"His Name Is Legs\\" as \\"somewhat silly but nonetheless thoroughly entertaining\\", a song that \\"[allows] Harrison the opportunity to close the disc on a lighter note and unleash his admittedly askew and undeniably rich sense of humor\\".Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 25 September 2017). In his review for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham calls the track a \\"manically intricate tribute\\" and considers it to be a redeeming feature of Extra Texture, along with \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\".Ingham, p. 135. Writing for Goldmine magazine in January 2002, Dave Thompson described it as \\"whacked\\" and \\"a six-minute semi-jam\\" that should not be \\"overlook[ed]\\".Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 17. Legacy Snow, Huntley and Inglis each discuss \\"His Name Is Legs\\" as a precedent for Harrison's well-received work with Idle.Huntley, pp. 129‚Äì30. Snow writes that, as unlikely as it seemed during Harrison's fallow period of 1975, \\"surreal English comedy would provide him with a new career.\\" Aside from Harrison's production of \\"The Lumberjack Song\\", for which he again used the Ohnothimagen moniker,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 372. their collaborations began with his guest appearance on Rutland Weekend Television,Harry, pp. 234, 257. which aired on BBC2 on 26 December 1975.Badman, p. 176.McCall, p. 47.

An alternative fable with the same moral concerning different animals is less well known. Freedom is sweet A famished wolf meets a well-fed dog and compliments him on his sleek appearance. The dog describes his life of ease and invites the wolf to join him. As they go on their way, the wolf asks why the fur about the dog's neck is worn away. He replies that it is merely caused by the collar he has to wear at home. The wolf then leaves him, declaring that a full belly is a poor price to pay for liberty. That the fable dates from before Aesop's time is suggested by a single line surviving from a poem by Archilochos in which the question is asked 'what has caused the scruff of his neck to become so worn'.Gert-Jan van Dijk, Ainoi, logoi, mythoi Leiden NL, pp.147-8 It is conjectured that this refers to some early version of the fable, which is well attested in later Greek sources, including the collection of Babrius, as well as in the Latin collection of Phaedrus. The fable was also well known in the Middle Ages, was included in William Caxton's collection, and was made the subject of a Neo- Latin poem by Hieronymus Osius.Phryx Aesopus Fable 58 In William Somervile's retelling, the moral is lengthened into a panegyric of Britain's sturdy independence.Robert Anderson, The Poets of Great Britain, Vol.8, pp.514-5 The \\"application\\" in Thomas Bewick's The Fables of Aesop (1818), however, observes more cautiously that \\"liberty in a state of society does not consist in doing whatsoever we please\\" and therefore \\"a certain portion of individual liberty must be given up for the good of the whole\\".\\"The Dog and the Wolf\\", pp.287-8 The story was also made the subject of one of La Fontaine's Fables (Le loup et le chien, I.5), in which Master Wolf, on learning the forfeit necessary, \\"took to its heels and is running yet\\".Elizur Wright's translation In modern times the text has been set for piano and high voice by the French composer Isabelle Aboulker.A performance on YouTube The wild animal and the beast of burden A fragmentary proverbial saying attributed to Ahiqar occurs in an Aramaic document dating from the 6th century BCE: A man one day said to the onager (wild ass), \\"Let me ride upon thee, and I will maintain thee ‚Ä¶\\" Said the wild ass, \\"Keep thy maintenance and thy fodder and let me not see thy riding.\\"Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Hendrickson 2010, Vol.2, p.507 Since the onager is an Asian animal, it suggests that this region may have been the origin of the alternative fable recorded as 183 in the Perry Index. In this the wild ass at first congratulates a grazing pack-animal's sleek condition but eventually is grateful for his own freedom after seeing the other being driven along beneath a load.Aesopica site A later 'Christianised' versionF.R.Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin Fable III, p.254 is now numbered as the independent fable 411 in the Perry Index. There the onager jeers at a donkey, only to be eaten by a lion since it is not guarded by a human.Aesopica site References External links Illustrations in books from the 15th - 20th century.

A Republican, Bright is a former member of the South Carolina Senate. First elected in 2008, he represented the 12th District which includes Spartanburg and Greenville counties until 2017. Early life and education Lee Bright was raised in Pauline, South Carolina. Bright graduated from Dorman High School in 1988. Career =Spartanburg School District= Bright was elected to the Spartanburg School District Six Board in 1999, and served on the board until his election to the South Carolina legislature. As a school board member, Bright called for teaching creationism in school science classes, explaining, \\"they're teaching evolution right now in school, and it's only a theory.\\" In 2005, Bright was recognized with a \\"Friend of the Taxpayer\\" award from Citizens for Efficient Government. =Private business= After serving as a trucking brokerage salesman for many years, Bright started his own trucking business, On Time, LLC. The company grew to employ over 100 people but was unable to recover after the Great Recession of 2008. Bright has since been employed in a number of salesmen roles and in 2014 he started The Bright Agency, an independent insurance agency. =South Carolina Senate= Bright contested the district 12 South Carolina senate seat held by first-term incumbent John Hawkins in 2004, losing in a tight race by less than 50 votes. In 2008 Bright successfully challenged for the district 12 senate seat. Hawkins chose not to seek reelection, leaving Bright to contest state Rep. Scott Talley for the Republican nomination, which he ultimately won, along with the general election. The 2012 election marked a replay of 2004 as John Hawkins came out of retirement to challenge Bright in a campaign noted for its intensity. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Bright over Hawkins, a move some claimed was in response to Hawkins' endorsement of Haley's 2010 election rival, Democrat Vincent Sheheen. Bright was, ultimately, handily reelected winning every precinct in his district and 65% of the primary vote. He went on to win the general election as well. Bright lost his 2016 re- election bid in a primary runoff to former state Rep. Scott Talley. Nikki Haley reversed herself and endorsed Bright's opponent this year. =2014 U.S. Senate campaign= Bright announced on August 13, 2013, that he would seek his party's nomination for United States Senate against incumbent Republican Lindsey Graham. Bright placed a distant second with 15.43% of the vote.http://www.enr-scvotes.org/SC/51763/133986/en/summary.html# =2018 U.S. House campaign= Bright ran in the 2018 Republican primary to replace retiring Republican incumbent Trey Gowdy in South Carolina's 4th congressional district. He finished first in the June 12, 2018, primary with 25% of the vote, but two weeks later lost the primary run-off election to William Timmons on June 26, 2018. Political positions =Abortion= Bright has been a strong opponent of abortion and has been a sponsor of the \\"Life Begins at Conception Act\\" for three years. In April 2013, Bright introduced a bill attempting to \\"require doctors performing abortions to have board certification in obstetrics and gynecology. Doctors performing abortions in outpatient settings also would be required to have staff privileges at a local hospital.\\" Pro-Choice proponents argued that the legislation would end all abortions in South Carolina and the bill was defeated in subcommittee. =Education= In May 2013, Bright was one of four senators who voted against a bill that would reduce government oversight of Clemson University. =Elections= In 2011 Bright cast the lone \\"no\\" vote in the South Carolina senate against a measure that would allow early voting, explaining \\"I think people ought to vote on Election Day.\\" Along with Democrat Vincent Sheheen, Bright helped to write an ethics reform package that would require state legislators to wait eight years after leaving office before they could lobby their peers. =Endorsements= Bright backed Mark Sanford in his 2006 race for Governor of South Carolina. Bright described himself as troubled by the 2009 revelation that Sanford had flown to Argentina to meet with his mistress, but stopped short of joining calls for the governor's resignation. In the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, Bright supported Michele Bachmann and was her South Carolina campaign chair. After Bachmann withdrew from the race, Bright switched his endorsement to Ron Paul. Ron Paul in Greenville; SC state Senator Lee Bright on the left. =Fiscal policy= In 2011, Bright introduced S.500 to study the solvency of money and the Federal Reserve. In advocating his proposal, Bright quipped \\"If at first you don't secede, try again.\\" Bright has also been an outspoken critic of government spending, and was designated as one of four \\"taxpayer heroes in the Senate\\" by the South Carolina chapter of the Club for Growth for the legislative session of 2011‚Äì2012. The Club for Growth is a PAC that describes themselves as \\"fiscally conservative\\" and has been opposed by Republicans Haley Barbour and Karl Rove.Club for Growth Bright also received the Friend of Taxpayer Award from the Spartanburg County Taxpayers Association. He had the highest rating of the Palmetto Liberty PAC on its legislative scorecard, and was unanimously endorsed by The Republican Liberty Caucus of South Carolina In 2012, after Governor Nikki Haley vetoed funding for a private organizations, teacher pay raises, and funding for the South Carolina Arts Commission, Bright voted to sustain the veto. =Gun control= In 2010 Bright sponsored legislation that would make any firearm produced in the state exempt from federal regulations, but the legislation stalled while being processed by committee. On December 13, 2012, Bright re-filed to reintroduce the legislation. On January 19, 2013, Bright proposed legislation that would allow public schools to offer a class in firearms marksmanship. Bright is the author of the Constitutional Carry Act of 2013 which would allow citizens to carry firearms without a permit. Bright was one of six senators to oppose the bi-partisan \\"Boland Bill\\", a bill that would make it easier for the state to track people found to be legally incompetent and make it more difficult for them to obtain a firearm. =Health policy= Bright has been an outspoken opponent of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the 2010 health care reform championed by President Barack Obama. In 2012, Bright sponsored a bill that would criminalize implementation of the Act, providing for penalties of up to two years for state officials who attempted to implement it and penalties of up to four years for federal officials who attempted to implement it. Bright involved the discredited legal theory of nullification in support of the legislation. Because the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, legal experts said the act would be unenforceable even if passed, due to the Supremacy Clause. =Transgender issues= In 2016 Lee Bright introduced a bill in the South Carolina Senate that would have prevented any municipality in the state from passing or maintaining transgender equality ordinances. =Refugee resettlement= The South Carolina Senate in 2016 considered a bill sponsored by Senator Bright that would require refugees in South Carolina to register with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The bill would further hold non-profit resettlement agencies in the state financially liable for any crimes committed by a refugee that they assisted. While the bill's intent was focused on Syrian refugees, relief groups stated that no Syrian refugees have been resettled in South Carolina. =Confederate flag controversy= On June 23, 2015, Bright was one of three Senate members including Tom Corbin (R-Greenville) and Danny Verdin (R-Laurens) who voted against removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds in the wake of the Charleston church shooting. The movement to remove the flag from the grounds had the support of Governor Nikki Haley, as well as from public figures in- and outside the state. The vote to debate the removal was approved 103 in favor and 10 opposed. Bright publicly compared the call to remove the flag to a \\"Stalinist purge\\". During debate on the flag on July 6, Bright said that the legislature should instead debate same-sex marriage after the Supreme Court of the United States ruling in the Obergefell v. Hodges. Bright proposed an amendment to replace the battle flag with the first national flag of the Confederacy; it was tabled by the Senate until August 3. Bright believes that a majority of citizens in South Carolina would like the flag to remain, saying, \\"It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but I believe the majority of South Carolinians would like to see it up, and I believe I speak for the majority of South Carolinians, so I would like to prove that with a vote.\\" He continued his speech saying, \\"They are concerned that they are being painted with the same stroke as the murderer down in Charleston. They feel that they and their ancestors are being disparaged and that's not very fair.\\" In his arguments against the flag's removal, he stated that the 20,000 soldiers from South Carolina who fought in the Civil War were being stripped of their honor by the flag's removal. The bill to remove the flag passed the Senate on July 6, 2015.http://www.scstatehouse.gov/votehistory.php?KEY=10430 Early in the morning of July 9, the bill passed the South Carolina House of Representatives and was signed into law that afternoon by Governor Haley. Personal life Bright is a member of Roebuck Baptist Church (Southern Baptist), Bright is a member of the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary's Board of Visitors. In 2013, he was re-nominated to a second four-year term on the board of trustees of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberties Commission. Bright also served as a member of the Palmetto Family Council's Board of Directors, and the South Carolina Attorney General's Commission on the Family 2001 Advisory Board.

It also proposed that the doctrine of indirect signification (lak·π£a·πáƒÅ) plays a central role in Sankara's theological method.De Smet, 'The Theological Method of Samkara' 290, 292.

This song, like ‚Äú'The skipper's dream\\", is based on one of his \\"dream sequences\\" It was written soon after the announcements in the press that gold (or more correctly \\"goold\\") had been discovered in 1854 in Victoria, on the continent of Australia (again more correctly \\"Asstrilly\\"). This gold find created a rush of (mainly) single men wishing to emigrate to what had previously been considered a \\"penal colony\\" and a very unpopular destination. They were all willing to make the hazardous and long sea journey for the promise of \\"easy\\" riches. For the Tyneside workforce with the added problems of punishing industrial labour with long hours, poor conditions and low pay, or more likely unemployment, the promise was even more enticing. This is just one of the many songs written at that time about the Australian gold rush.

Many of these \\"chapbooks\\" were on poor quality paper to a poor standard and with poor quality print. The works were copied with no thoughts of copyright, and the work required very little proof-reading, and what was done was not required to a high standard. Between the many versions published there are differences, some very minor, proof reading spelling errors, variations mainly in the spelling of the words, and these sometimes variations within the same edition. In several of the later versions, there were many changes to the spoken monologue, some of which are as follows :- The first line of the letter he called the pen \\"a Penxswrit\\" and with an aside added of \\"aside, Marcy what a lot o' letters he hes for spellin' pen. What a scholar he's turned; he must gan tiv a neet skeul though the day; aw shuddent wonder.\\" After the story about having a pistol and sword is added another aside. \\"The greet thick-heeded lubbert! What set him there? he wis deein' weel here, puddlin at Hawk's‚Äîthree days a week overtime an' ne wages.\\" followed by \\"Give maw respects te Bill Scott, the Shingler, oot at Consett, en tell him te hev a luck at the tin bottle for maw sake.\\" Before the story about the convicts bitting off Jimmy's ears, we have added ‚Äì \\"Ned Corvan says he's nobbit a reet un. We hae nee tripe so we struggle wi' fustin‚Äîthere's ne Butcher's meat here, except Wild Buffaloes en Yarmouth beef.\\" followed by a slightly revised story of Jimmie's ears as \\"Little Jimmy's nowt like his feythor noo; some hungry convicts bit off the laddie's lugs; if ye saw him ye'd 'mawjin he'd been at Carson's drawing the Badger.\\" The final piece before the signature reads ‚Äì ‚Äì \\"Nee more at present from yor Confectionate Brother,\\" and the P.S.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 February 2011. Ewing confirmed his departure in December 2013 and Heath made his on-screen exit on 29 July 2014, but made a brief appearance on 23 September 2014 for his brother Casey's (Lincoln Younes) funeral. Heath and Bianca made a return in 2016 and departed on 3 February 2017. Ewing reprised the role in August 2020 and was pictured filming on-location in Riverstone for a storyline airing in late 2020. Creation and casting In late 2010, Network Seven began running teaser trailers for a new trio of characters known as \\"The River Boys\\". Said to be a \\"bad-boy surf gang with dodgy reputations\\", The River Boys consist of three brothers ‚Äì Heath, Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) and Casey (Lincoln Younes). Koby Abberton's Bra Boys were the inspiration for The River Boys. Heath made his on screen debut in February 2011. Heath was the first of The River Boys to be announced, with Ewing's casting revealed on 24 September 2010. Heath is Ewing's second role with Home and Away, having appeared as Reuben Humphries in 2007. For his role, Ewing had to get fit and he joked \\"I don't think they would cast overweight guys to play surfers, so yeah, I'm sure it was a factor for the producers.\\" He added that he cannot surf well and was relieved that the producers did not test his surfing skills at his audition. Initially, Ewing was employed as a member of the guest cast. He told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Heath was originally planned to be a part of the series for six months, but revealed that he had since joined the regular cast. Development =Characterisation= Heath is the second oldest of the Braxton brothers and was initially described as being \\"feared by cops and the residents of his home town of Mangrove River\\" and having a short fuse. The character of Heath is described as \\"Mad, bad and dangerous to know.\\" Out of The River Boys, Heath is the most volatile and he is feared by everyone from the police to the Mangrove River residents. Darryl is the only person Heath listens to and he follows his guidance. Channel Seven say Heath \\"loves the camaraderie and sense of family, not to mention the respect that comes with being a member. It's a privilege to be a River Boy and the worst thing anyone could do ever do is be one and then betray the group.\\" Heath does not back down over anything and he feels that the River Boys are always being blamed for things they have not done. Heath was ten when his father left and his mother loves him \\"extravagantly, but has a volatile relationship with him.\\" Heath has always found his younger brother, Casey (Lincoln Younes), weird for his love of reading. Ewing said that Heath is \\"there to stir things up ‚Äì a human hand grenade as they say. I‚Äôm there for trouble-making purposes.\\" Ewing told Digital Spy that Heath does have a soft side and he promised that viewers will see Heath start to change and more vulnerable aspects to his personality will come out. Of this change, he said \\"I think even the toughest guys in the Bay have a soft side. It's actually very interesting to watch it unfold and I love finding out why these guys have become who they are.\\" Ewing added that he shares some similarities to his character, they both like to party and stay in shape. Younes told Holy Soap that in comparison to his character Casey - Heath \\"shows hints of sensitivity or insecurity at a slower pace, and these are usually revealed around crises.\\" =Departure= On 9 December 2013, Ewing confirmed that he would be leaving Home and Away. Rumours about Ewing's exit began when it was announced that he had signed up with a US talent management company. Of his decision to leave, Ewing said \\"I will say I do go, but I am not sure about the exact date yet. It will be fun ‚Äì and scary.\\" In February 2014, Ewing told Jenny Brown from New Idea that he would be filming until early March. He said that while he loved working on the show, he felt that it was easy to \\"get in the groove and suddenly 10 years have passed...\\" Ewing also believed that he had accomplished all he wanted to with Home and Away. He added that it felt right to leave just as his contract came up and he had signed with the US management company. Heath departed in July 2014. =Returns= Ewing later reprised the role for the feature length spin-off called Home and Away: An Eye for an Eye broadcast in late 2015. He told Shannon Molloy of news.com.au that he was open to a return to Home and Away if the storyline was right for him. He said, \\"I wouldn't want to play the same old Heath for another three years though ‚Äì I'd want it to be fresh and him to have evolved.\\" In June 2016, it was announced that Ewing had agreed to reprise the role, alongside Gormley as Bianca, for a short guest stint to be broadcast later in the year. Ewing called the couple's return storyline \\"a great, fun opportunity\\". In early August 2020, Erin Doyle of New Idea reported that Ewing could be returning to Home and Away, after he was pictured alongside actors Ethan Browne and Rob Kipa-Williams, who play Tane Parata and Ari Parata, at an outdoor filming location. Ewing's return was later confirmed as he was pictured filming scenes alongside Browne, Kipa-Williams and Patrick O'Connor (Dean Thompson) in Riverstone while dressed in Heath's clothing. His scenes will air in late 2020. Storylines Heath arrives in Summer Bay along with his brothers; Darryl and Casey. Heath earns a reputation as a troublemaker and he harasses Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood) in the Diner. When Heath notices Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier) filming him and friends, he puts him in the boot of his car and dumps him in the bush. Heath causes a lot of trouble with the police for dealing drugs and loitering on the beach. He makes an enemy out of local policewoman Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Heath develops an interest in Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and they have sex, even though Bianca is dating Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead). Bianca tells Heath that it was a mistake. Heath learns that he has a daughter, Darcy (Alea O'Shea), and starts to bond with her. When Bianca is raped at a party, Heath becomes the prime suspect. However, he is later cleared. Heath stops a man from harassing Bianca and her friends, and she starts to respect him. Bianca and Heath have sex again. On the way home from a trip, Charlie and Brax crash into Liam. Bianca realises that she still loves Liam and ends her relationship with Heath. Heath begins dating Bianca's younger sister, April (Rhiannon Fish). Bianca gets angry at Heath and warns him to stay away from April. Heath cheats on April with Henrietta Brown (Emma Leonard) and she breaks up with him. Bianca marries Liam and finds out that she is pregnant. She initially tells Heath that the baby cannot be his, but later discovers her pregnancy is too far along for the baby to be Liam's. April tells Heath that he is the father and he is furious with Bianca and Liam for not telling him. When he learns that the couple are planning to leave the Bay, Heath hires Hayley O'Connor (Alyssa McClelland) to help him get joint custody. Liam and Bianca split up and Heath drops the court case. Heath goes to visit his father, Danny (Andy McPhee), in prison and decides to help get him released. Bianca develops pre-eclampsia and tells Heath that if anything happens, he must tell the doctors to save the baby. Bianca gives birth prematurely to a boy. She develops postnatal psychosis and thinks her baby is dead. Heath supports Bianca and visits their son. Bianca eventually recovers and she and Heath name their son Rocco. Heath and Bianca start dating again. Heath becomes angry with Casey when he shoots their father dead and refuses to talk to him for a while. Bianca comes to stay with Heath and briefly clashes with his mother. Rocco dies from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, devastating Heath. Bianca pulls away from him and he later breaks down in front of Brax. Bianca asks Heath to restrict the funeral to family only and they say goodbye to their son. Heath later places a wreath in the ocean and joins the River Boys for an all night memorial at the beach. Heath proposes to Bianca and she accepts. During a trip to Melbourne for his stag party, Heath has a one-night stand with Jess Lockwood (Georgia Chara). During his wedding, Heath confesses to Bianca and she punches him. Heath decides to leave the Bay, but Bianca stops him. Heath and Bianca get married. When Jade Montgomery (Tasma Walton) comes to the Bay after Mangrove River High is burnt down, she tries to frame Heath with an assault claim, but is thwarted by Tamara Kingsley (Kelly Paterniti). While Heath is visiting Brax's girlfriend, Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen), in the hospital, a bomb explodes. Heath is okay, but Bianca suffers a serious head injury, which causes some memory loss. A heavily pregnant Jess comes to the Bay to tell Heath that he is going to be a father. Heath helps deliver his son, Harley, on the beach and he spends time with Jess and Harley in Melbourne, causing a strain on his marriage. Heath soon learns that Jess has terminal cancer and when she dies, he brings Harley to live with him and Bianca. Bianca struggles to cope with Harley's presence and she and Heath break up. They eventually get back together, but Bianca soon learns that her transfer request to the city has been accepted. Heath encourages her to go, saying he will join her soon. Darcy's grandmother, Connie (Celia Ireland), initially refuses to let Darcy live with Heath and Bianca in the city, but later relents. After one final surf with his brothers, Heath says goodbye to his family. Bianca returns to collect Heath, Darcy and Harley and take them to their new place in the city. Heath attends Casey's funeral weeks later. Brax refuses to let him seek revenge on Jake Pirovic (Fletcher Humphrys) and Heath replies that he does not want to bury Brax the following week. Two years later, Heath follows Bianca to the Bay despite her asking him to give her some space. Bianca asks him to leave, but he stays in the Bay. Bianca invites him over to talk and it emerges that Heath killed Trevor Gunson (Diarmid Heidenreich). Reception For his portrayal of Heath, Ewing received a nomination for Most Popular New Male Talent at the 2012 Logie Awards. At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards, Ewing was nominated for Best Daytime Star. At the 2014 Logie Awards, Ewing earned a nomination for Most Popular Actor. In March 2011, Inside Soap ran a poll vote to determine who was the most liked of the Braxton brothers. Heath and Casey both received twenty-eight percent of the vote indicating that Brax was their favourite. Bree Hoskin of Gaydar Radio said that Heath is the \\"volatile middle Braxton boy\\". Since their inception, the Braxton brothers have been well received. Claire Crick of All About Soap said the publications staff were happy with their arrival. Crick added that they liked \\"a new bad boy\\", but three being introcued at once and all being attractive was much better. British broadcaster Channel 5 aired a series titled \\"Top 20 Aussie Soap Moments of 2011\\". This was to determine viewers favourite moments from both Home and Away and Neighbours. The arrival of the Braxtons was voted viewers fourth favourite moment on 2011. The arrival of the River Boys was featured in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2012, as part of their \\"best bits\\" of March 2011. Their reporter noted that viewers were \\"aquiver\\" at the prospect of three attractive males arriving; despite the residents of Summer Bay not sharing their enthusiasm. With Heath's rise in popularity, came false Facebook accounts in Ewing's name and girls \\"lining up\\" to meet him. While interviewed by Jason Herbison of Inside Soap, series producer Lucy Addario said that the response from fans, concerning the River Boys had been \\"utterly overwhelming\\". She added that their inclusion meant the series could \\"explore many different storylines and play out lots of great plots.\\" Erin Miller of TV Week said that Heath and Bianca shared a \\"sizzling\\" romance. While Miller's colleague Carolyn Stewart said that she was happy when Heath gets \\"the flick\\" because in her opinion Bianca was better suited to Liam. Andrew Mercado writing for TV Week said that Home and Away was ignoring its core value of foster children in favour of the \\"much older River Boys\\". He said that he wanted to see less of them on-screen. While they were a success story and ratings wise, he noted that there were viewer concerns about the accompanying violence. He also predicted that the \\"tattooed surfie boys\\" will not be around forever because the actors will \\"try their luck in Hollywood\\". Laura Morgan from All About Soap said that \\"Heath's not fussy - he'll go for anything in a short skirt\\", due to his romance with April.

They leased the tramway back to the former company who operated for the next 3 years. From 1901, contracts were awarded for the modernisation, electrification and extension of the system. On 3 December 1903, Lieutenant Colonel Sir Horatio Arthur Yorke carried out an inspection of the new extensions and passed them fit for service. The official opening ceremony took place on 31 December 1903, when the Mayor, the Council, officials and Justices of the Peace were conveyed in four special cars, covering most of the routes of the new network. Fifty drivers and fifty conductors were employed to start the corporation services which began on 1 January 1904. In June 1905, an agreement was made with the Wolverhampton District Electric Company whereby Walsall Corporation tramcars would be allowed to work over their tracks into the Market Place at Willenhall. A junction was constructed at the Willenhall Board Schools, and Walsall tramcars first ran through to Willenhall Market Place on 19 July 1905.\\"Tramways of Walsall\\", R.

In Bradford Place a bomb fell and the glass in the car was shattered. The Mayoress was severely injured and died from her injuries on 20 February. In 1920-21 the route from Pinfold to Bloxwich was doubled at a cost of ¬£14,313 (equivalent to ¬£ in ).

The investigation is focused on numerous, \\"Potential violations of federal law, including conspiracy, healthcare fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, tax violations, identity theft and money laundering,\\" Samanta Kelley, a special agent for the Food and Drug Administration's criminal division, said in an affidavit filed at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles.

Harrison began writing the song in 1969 and considered recording it for his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. In its finished, 1976 form, the lyrics of \\"Beautiful Girl\\" were inspired by Harrison's second wife, Olivia Arias. The recording features musical contributions from Billy Preston, Gary Wright and Willie Weeks. Some music critics have noted aspects of the Beatles' mid-'60s sound in \\"Beautiful Girl\\"; like much of Thirty Three & 1/3, the song is highly regarded for its melodic qualities. Author Nicholas Schaffner described the track as \\"a great lost Rubber Soul classic\\".Schaffner, p. 192. Background and composition In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison states that he began writing \\"Beautiful Girl\\" during sessions for singer Doris Troy's eponymous solo album on Apple Records,Harrison, p. 190. recording for which commenced in October 1969.Spizer, p. 340. Harrison co-produced the album with Troy, and one of the musicians who contributed to the sessions was Stephen Stills,\\"Doris Troy\\", Apple Records (retrieved 2 February 2013). whose \\"very good\\" 12-string acoustic guitar Harrison borrowed one evening, during which he came up with the tune to \\"Beautiful Girl\\". Harrison's inspiration for the song's lyrics was his wife, Pattie Boyd,Clayson, p. 271. but he was unable to write more than a single verse, which begins:Harrison, pp. 190, 193. After trying out the song at the start of production for All Things Must Pass in May 1970,Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'Beautiful Girl'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 3 February 2013). a month after the Beatles' break-up,Spizer, p. 220. \\"Beautiful Girl\\" \\"sank back into the distance\\", according to Harrison. He returned to the composition in 1976,Madinger & Easter, p. 454. by which time he had split with Boyd and was living with Olivia Trinidad Arias, his future wife.Huntley, pp. 49‚Äì50, 120.Jackson, p. 149. Harrison met Arias in October 1974,Olivia Harrison, \\"Introduction\\", in Harrison, p. 1. at a party in Los Angeles, shortly after Boyd had left him for his friend Eric Clapton.Clayson, pp. 329, 363. Harrison had spoken to her frequently throughout that year, however,Rodriguez, p. 424.Tillery, p. 115. since Arias was working as a secretary for A&M; Records, and by extension, for his recently launched Dark Horse record label.Greene, pp. 220‚Äì21. Intrigued by their daily phone calls, Harrison asked a friend who was visiting A&M;'s offices to try to obtain a photo of her. Their eventual meeting constituted \\"the much-fabled 'love at first sight'\\", according to Beatles author Robert Rodriguez, and the couple \\"became inseparable\\". As well as accompanying Harrison throughout his ensuing North American tour with Ravi Shankar,Tillery, pp. 115‚Äì16. Arias's \\"dusky Mexican features\\", in the words of Nicholas Schaffner, \\"grace[d] the label\\" of his Dark Horse album, released in December 1974.Schaffner, p. 176. Like Harrison, Arias was dedicated to a spiritual path aligned with Hinduism, meditation and yoga,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 133.Huntley, p. 120. and her presence helped him overcome the fallout following that controversial tour,Greene, p. 221. particularly his continued alcoholism that led to a near- fatal bout of hepatitis in mid 1976.Clayson, pp. 359, 363.Tillery, p. 117. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison acknowledges that when finishing the lyrics to \\"Beautiful Girl\\", he \\"related it then to Olivia\\". Author Ian Inglis recognises some of the lines in the newly written second verse as both a \\"fitting description of the freedom and relaxation that had replaced the tension and constraints of his previous life\\", and an obvious example of Harrison's gratitude to Arias:Inglis, p. 61. Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, views the structure of the song as typical of its composer's style, where, as in \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", \\"Beware of Darkness\\" and \\"Give Me Love\\", the chorus and verse are one and the same.Leng, pp. 192‚Äì93. \\"On 'Beautiful Girl',\\" Leng writes, \\"the main musical hook comes with the first line of the piece, and all the musical themes head back inexorably to that resolution.\\"Leng, p. 193. These themes include the \\"attractive, rising\\" bridge sections that lead to a \\"clever descending series of guitar runs\\" returning to the verse-chorus. Speaking to Rolling Stone magazine in early 1979, by which time he and Arias were married and the parents of a newborn son, Dhani,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 46. Harrison further acknowledged Arias' positive influence on his life when discussing the despondency behind his Dark Horse song \\"Simply Shady\\": \\"I wasn't ready to join Alcoholics Anonymous or anything ‚Äì I don't think I was that far gone ‚Äì but I could put back a bottle of brandy occasionally, plus all the other naughty things that fly around. I just went on a binge ... Then I met Olivia and it all worked out fine.\\"Mick Brown, \\"An Interview with George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 3 February 2013). Other Harrison love songs dedicated to Arias include \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\"Leng, pp. 206‚Äì07. and \\"Your Love Is Forever\\",Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'Your Love Is Forever'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 3 February 2013). both released on the 1979 album George Harrison.Madinger & Easter, p. 458. Recording Harrison first recorded \\"Beautiful Girl\\" on 20 May 1970 at Abbey Road Studios, during a run- through of possible songs for inclusion on All Things Must Pass.Madinger & Easter, p. 426. With co-producer Phil Spector as his audience,Leng, p. 77. Harrison performed the track solo on acoustic guitar, acknowledging that the composition was unfinished and lacked even a title. The performance of \\"Beautiful Girl\\" featured Harrison repeating the words to verse one and vocalising the melody to the song's bridge sections, instead of singing any lyrics. Along with songs that he went on to develop for All Things Must Pass, and others such as \\"Mother Divine\\" and \\"Cosmic Empire\\" that have yet to be officially released, this early version of \\"Beautiful Girl\\" is available on the Beware of ABKCO! bootleg.\\"George Harrison ‚Äì Beware of ABKCO!\\", Bootleg Zone (retrieved 18 January 2013). The recording sessions for Thirty Three & 1/3, Harrison's first release as a Dark Horse artist, began in May 1976 at his home studio at Friar Park, known as FPSHOT.Badman, p. 186. The musicians accompanying him on the basic track for \\"Beautiful Girl\\" were bassist Willie Weeks, drummer Alvin Taylor, Richard Tee on pianoLeng, p. 192. and, according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, keyboard player Gary Wright. In between his touring commitments with the Rolling Stones, Billy Preston overdubbed further keyboard parts, including what AllMusic critic Lindsay Planer terms the song's \\"billowing organ runs\\". Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott served as assistant producer on the album,Madinger & Easter, p. 453. although he did not play on \\"Beautiful Girl\\". Harrison contracted hepatitis shortly after recording the album's backing tracks, and minimal work was carried out until his recovery towards the end of the summer. Over his electric rhythm guitars, Harrison overdubbed two slide-guitar parts for the song's \\"characteristically fluid\\" solo.Rodriguez, p. 171. Leng writes of this instrumental passage and the song-closing solo: \\"['Beautiful Girl'] is boosted by two excellent guitar breaks which, in the coda, even run at a counterpoint to the countermelody.\\" Release and reception A&M; Records took advantage of Harrison's late completion of the new album, which he was contracted to deliver by 26 July 1976,Badman, p. 187. to launch legal proceedings against him in order to offload the loss-making Dark Horse label.Clayson, p. 359.Woffinden, pp. 102‚Äì03. Both parties soon reached an amicable settlement, resulting in Harrison signing a new distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records.Clayson, pp. 359‚Äì60.Badman, p. 193. Thirty Three & 1/3 was released in mid November, with \\"Beautiful Girl\\" appearing as track 3,Madinger & Easter, p. 635. in between the Paramahansa Yogananda-inspired \\"Dear One\\" and the album's lead single, \\"This Song\\".Leng, pp. 192‚Äì94. Harrison wrote the latter song in response to another source of litigation at this time, the \\"My Sweet Lord\\"/\\"He's So Fine\\" plagiarism suit.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188.Woffinden, p. 104. Music critics praised Thirty Three & 1/3 as a return to form for Harrison, with \\"Beautiful Girl\\" a noted example of him having rediscovered the melodic flair that had been lacking on his previous two albums, Dark Horse and Extra Texture.Schaffner, pp. 182, 192. Billboard magazine described the release as \\"a sunny, upbeat album of love songs and cheerful jokes\\" and added: \\"Harrison's often-spectacular melody writing gift gets brilliant display here.\\"Nat Freedland (ed.), \\"Top Album Picks\\", Billboard, 5 December 1976, p. 58 (retrieved 23 August 2014). In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Schaffner wrote: \\"Thirty-three and a Third boasts the most varied and tuneful collection of Harrison melodies to date ... and 'Beautiful Girl' could just as easily be an A-1 Beatle tune, a great lost Rubber Soul classic.\\" In a review for Melody Maker that referenced the same 1965 Beatles album, Ray Coleman highlighted the quality of Harrison's vocals and described \\"Beautiful Girl\\" as \\"an especially well-crafted song\\".Ray Coleman, \\"Harrison Regains His Rubber Soul\\", Melody Maker, 27 November 1976, p. 23. \\"'Dear One' and 'Beautiful Girl',\\" Coleman continued, \\"are touching celebrations of love, simply sung to neatly-formed, attractive tunes.\\" Writing in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, Mac Randall named \\"Beautiful Girl\\" as \\"one of the many highlights of [Harrison's] upbeat return to pop form\\".Brackett & Hoard, p. 368. In his Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin describes Thirty Three & 1/3 as \\"perhaps Harrison's finest album since his landmark debut, All Things Must Pass\\", and he views \\"Beautiful Girl\\" as \\"a gorgeous love song\\", which, along with \\"Dear One\\", is one of the album's \\"real highlights\\" and a song that \\"could have come straight off of The Beatles' Abbey Road\\".\\"Harrison, George ‚Äì Thirty-Three & 1/3: Encyclopedia of Popular Music\\", oxfordindex.oup.com (retrieved 8 March 2015). Lindsay Planer of AllMusic describes the song as \\"lovely and lyrical\\", while Ian Inglis writes: \\"The confident melody, warm harmonies, and leaping guitar solos combine to produce the kind of uncomplicated and satisfying ballad that he (and Paul McCartney) had produced on The Beatles and Abbey Road.\\" Another Harrison biographer, Elliot Huntley, similarly approves of \\"Beautiful Girl\\"'s \\"enchanting melody\\" and notes its transformation from the 1970 demo version into \\"a masterpiece, complete with a thrilling conversational guitar solo\\", in which the two parts \\"interweave and answer one another\\".Huntley, pp. 146‚Äì47. Leng also recognises the song's Beatle qualities, writing: \\"'Beautiful Girl' is full of guitar arpeggios and vocal harmonies that might have come straight from Rubber Soul, albeit updated with a 1970s production and the singer's own beguiling guitar statements ... Harrison's melodic gifts have rarely been better showcased.\\"Leng, pp. 192, 193. Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense has discussed the song's guitar solos in the context of how Harrison's playing eschews \\"pyrotechnic flourishes\\" for an approach that is instead \\"thoughtful and original, deceptively simple sounding, invested with feeling\\". Rense pairs \\"Beautiful Girl\\" with the 1981-released \\"Life Itself\\" as examples where Harrison's \\"conversational duet- solos ‚Ä¶ are impressively imaginative, virtuosic\\".Rip Rense, \\"There Went the Sun: Reflection on the Passing of George Harrison\\", Beatlefan, 29 January 2002 (retrieved 14 December 2014). Author Andrew Grant Jackson includes the track in his book subtitled The Essential Solo Beatles Songs, and writes that \\"the chiming electric arpeggios perfectly capture the feeling of seeing a beautiful face for the first time.\\"Jackson, p. 148.

","title":"Beautiful Girl (George Harrison song)"},{"id":"34610378","text":"\\"See Yourself\\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3. Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self- awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \\"Within You Without You\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\". Harrison recorded \\"See Yourself\\" at his Friar Park home studio in Henley, Oxfordshire. The recording features extensive use of keyboard instruments, played by Billy Preston, Gary Wright and Harrison, the last of whom contributed one of the track's prominent synthesizer parts. On the album cover, Harrison dedicated the song to Paramahansa Yogananda, founder of the Self-Realization Fellowship and author of Autobiography of a Yogi. Background Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon and their wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965,Tillery, pp. 43‚Äì44. when a dentist friend slipped it into their after-dinner coffee.Greene, p. 54. The heightened perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles,Lavezzoli, pp. 175, 176, 178‚Äì80.Tillery, pp. 51, 52. notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967),Schaffner, pp. 76‚Äì77.Herstgaard, pp. 177, 184, 194‚Äì96. and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 34, 37.Tillery, pp. 35, 54, 58‚Äì59, 61, 87, 121‚Äì22. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt as a result of first taking the drug: \\"I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, and there was no way back to what I was before.\\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 145.Tillery, p. 47. While Ringo Starr had joined Harrison and Lennon for their second LSD experience, in August 1965,Ringo Starr and John Lennon, in The Beatles, p. 190. Paul McCartney remained wary of its reality-distorting effectMacDonald, pp. 149, 165‚Äì66. and, despite peer pressure from his bandmates,Paul McCartney, in The Beatles, p. 255.Carol Clerk, \\"George Harrison\\", Uncut, February 2002; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 23 July 2014). declined to partake of the drug until late in 1966.Sounes, p. 184. On 19 June 1967, by which time it had become the recreational drug of choice among the counterculture, during the Summer of Love,Schaffner, p. 74.Derek Taylor, in The Beatles, p. 254. McCartney confirmed to an ITN reporter that he had taken LSD,Miles, p. 270. having already admitted as much to journalists from Life magazine and the Sunday People over the previous few days.Sounes, pp. 183‚Äì84. A public outcry followed McCartney's announcement,Doggett, p. 20.Schaffner, p. 76. which inconvenienced the other Beatles by bringing their drug use into the spotlight.Sounes, p. 185. Author Ian MacDonald describes McCartney's candour as a \\"careless admission\\" that, as with Lennon's comment in March 1966 that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity, \\"brought howls of righteous anger on their heads\\".MacDonald, pp. 19‚Äì20. Although Harrison, Lennon and Starr appeared to support McCartney's claim that it was the media's responsibility to decide whether the admission should become public knowledge, and not the individual's responsibility to lie, they were also suspicious about McCartney's motives,The Beatles, p. 255.Norman, pp. 498‚Äì99. with Harrison suggesting he had done it for attention. Lennon later equated the episode with McCartney's announcement of the Beatles' break-up as part of his promotion for his 1970 solo album, McCartney, Lennon stating in a 1972 interview: \\"He always times his big announcements right on the letter, doesn't he?\\"John Lennon, in The Beatles, p. 255.Norman, p. 499. Composition Harrison began writing the song \\"See Yourself\\" in 1967 in response to the furore surrounding McCartney's admission.Giuliano, pp. 224‚Äì25.Rodriguez, p. 171. In his autobiography, I Me Mine, Harrison introduces the opening verse, which begins \\"It's easier to tell a lie than it is to tell the truth\\", with the comment \\"There was a big outcry with people saying [to McCartney] 'You should have said \\"No!\\"' ...\\"Harrison, p. 108. Author Ian Inglis suggests that this opening lyric reveals Harrison's \\"mixed emotions over the wisdom of total honesty\\".Inglis, p. 62. Inglis adds that \\"while the dilemma about whether to reveal or conceal the truth to others is insuperable, the important thing is to be true to oneself\\", as reflected in the song title. Musically, the composition incorporates a shift in time signature during the verses, from standard rock 4/4 rhythm to what Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes as \\"stuttering, staccato\\" 9/8.Leng, p. 194. This departure from pop convention was reflective of Harrison's immersion in Indian music,Clayson, p. 213. during a period when he devoted himself to studying the sitar, partly under the tuition of Bengali Hindu musician Ravi Shankar.Lavezzoli, pp. 176, 184‚Äì85. In I Me Mine, Harrison states that after writing much of the song in 1967, he forgot about it until nine years later. By then, after having espoused self-realization and God consciousness in much of his solo work since the Beatles' break-up, Harrison had chosen to soften his message,Allison, p. 48.Greene, pp. 220‚Äì21. partly as a result of the contentment he had found with his new partner, Olivia Arias.Mick Brown, \\"An Interview with George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 4 September 2013).Rodriguez, p. 424. Along with the lyrics to the song's second and third verses, Harrison completed the middle eight in 1976: In the final verse, Inglis identifies similar \\"reflections about the politics of free will\\" as in Lennon's lyric \\"There's nothing you can do that can't be done\\", from the Beatles' 1967 single \\"All You Need Is Love\\": Paramahansa Yogananda (pictured in the 1940s), to whom Harrison dedicated his song \\"See Yourself\\" Inglis writes that by \\"see\\", Harrison means to \\"know\\" oneself. In this way, \\"See Yourself\\" echoes the message of Harrison's 1967 compositions for the Beatles \\"Within You Without You\\" and \\"It's All Too Much\\" ‚Äì both of which he wrote while absorbing the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda, founder of the Self- Realization Fellowship.Clayson, pp. 206, 208, 216.Tillery, p. 56. In a December 1967 interview, Harrison paraphrased part of the song's lyrics when asked to comment on the criticism then being levelled against the Beatles' Transcendental Meditation teacher, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, saying: \\"It's easier to criticise somebody than to see yourself.\\"Nick Jones, \\"Beatle George And Where He's At\\", Melody Maker, 16 December 1967; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Leng views the lyrical themes in \\"See Yourself\\" as similar to those of two songs focusing on human relationships, \\"Run of the Mill\\" and \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", both released on Harrison's 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. Leng highlights \\"Run of the Mill\\"'s theme of \\"individual choice versus responsibility\\" and \\"Isn't It a Pity\\"'s preoccupation with \\"selfishness, false words, and false friends\\" as areas that Harrison revisits in \\"See Yourself\\".Leng, pp. 92, 194. Recording Following the expiration of his recording contract with EMI-affiliated Apple Records in January 1976,Tillery, pp. 116, 117. Harrison recorded \\"See Yourself\\" for his debut album on his Dark Horse record label, Thirty Three & 1/3.Madinger & Easter, pp. 453, 455. He returned to the song at the suggestion of Shankar's nephew, Kumar Shankar,Madinger & Easter, p. 455. who worked as a sound engineer at Harrison's home studio, FPSHOT, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.Leng, p. 146. \\"See Yourself\\" was one of a number of unfinished compositions from the late 1960s that Harrison revisited when making the album,Rodriguez, pp. 170‚Äì71. in what some commentators view as a sign of writer's block, brought on by charges that he had plagiarised the Ronnie Mack song \\"He's So Fine\\" in his 1970‚Äì71 hit single \\"My Sweet Lord\\".Clayson, pp. 355, 357.Huntley, pp. 149‚Äì50. The sessions for Thirty Three & 1/3 took place at FPSHOT, beginning in May 1976,Badman, p. 186. with jazz saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott providing production assistance.Madinger & Easter, pp. 453‚Äì54. Harrison played acoustic guitar on the basic track, accompanied by Billy Preston (piano), Gary Wright (keyboards), Willie Weeks (bass) and Alvin Taylor (drums). Leng notes the influence of Wright's 1975 hit album The Dream Weaver on the recording and describes \\"See Yourself\\" as \\"the first Harrisong basically arranged for synthesizers\\". Preston, Harrison and Wright all contributed synthesizer parts,CD booklet, Thirty Three & 1/3 reissue (Dark Horse Records, 2004; produced by George Harrison). while Harrison also overdubbed tambourine and backing vocals. Speaking in Los Angeles later in the year, Harrison said of the track: \\"As we overdubbed more things on it, I began to like it more and more.\\"Giuliano, pp. 223, 224. Overdubbing and mixing took place over the summer,Madinger & Easter, p. 454. with all work on the song completed by 13 September. Release and reception Thirty Three & 1/3 was released in November 1976,Badman, p. 198. with \\"See Yourself\\" appearing as the final track on side one of the original LP format, sequenced after the album's lead single, \\"This Song\\".Madinger & Easter, pp. 454, 634‚Äì35. As with \\"Dear One\\",Clayson, p. 358. Harrison dedicated the song to Paramhansa Yogananda on the album cover.Inglis, pp. 60, 62. During his extensive promotion for Thirty Three & 1/3,Clayson, p. 360.Huntley, p. 152. Harrison visited US secretary of state Henry Kissinger in Washington DC and presented him with a copy of Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 130. one of Harrison's favourite books.Tillery, p. 81. The release coincided with a wave of renewed interest in the Beatles' work,Rodriguez, p. 293. sparked by EMI/Capitol Records reissuing the band's catalog following the demise of Apple.Doggett, pp. 240, 245.Huntley, pp. 150‚Äì51. Music critics praised Thirty Three & 1/3 as Harrison's finest album since All Things Must Pass,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188.Schaffner, p. 192. and wrote approvingly of the more subtle tone of his spiritual message compared with the perceived preachiness of Living in the Material World (1973) and Dark Horse (1974).Carr & Tyler, pp. 120‚Äì21.Woffinden, p. 103. Author Robert Rodriguez comments on the song's release in 1976: \\"Whereas in the past, George might have been a little more heavy-handed in his criticism of hypocrisy, here he slaps back gently.\\" In a review for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman wrote of the subject matter of \\"See Yourself\\" and other songs on Thirty Three & 1/3: \\"This isn't a very 'immediate' record ... But as proved by All Things Must Pass, Harrison's material is deep and requires the listener to persevere. Two or three spins bring out a musical and lyrical warmth from an artist who refuses to stand still.\\"Ray Coleman, \\"Harrison Regains His Rubber Soul\\", Melody Maker, 27 November 1976, p. 23. In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner described the \\"tastefulness\\" of Harrison's performance on synthesizer as \\"unmatched in rock\\". Referring to Harrison's gift to Kissinger in November 1976, in relation to the era when the song was written, Schaffner added: \\"Another sign of the times, perhaps. Back in 1964 even the thought of such a meeting would have been preposterous; in 1967 it would have seemed the pinnacle of the surreal.\\"Schaffner, p. 193. On an album that he considers \\"a renewal\\" and \\"one of Harrison's best\\", Simon Leng describes \\"See Yourself\\" as \\"the least interesting track\\".Leng, pp. 194, 197. While acknowledging the \\"adventurous\\" quality of the song's time signature, Leng views the arrangement as \\"too ponderous\\" and the melody \\"mostly bland\\". Another Harrison biographer, theologian Dale Allison, describes the song as \\"A call to serious self- examination ... it recalls the earlier and better 'Run Of The Mill.'\\"Allison, p. 154. In the 2005 publication NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, Adrian Thrills names \\"See Yourself\\" as a highlight of Thirty Three & 1/3, an album that was an \\"upbeat affair that seemed to restore Harrison's love for music\\".Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 22. Writing for Mojo magazine, John Harris describes the song as \\"a revived lost oldie\\" and \\"an intriguingly sympathetic look at Paul's 1967 admission that he'd taken acid\\".John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 82.

Category:Indian mythology in music Category:Paramahansa Yogananda ","title":"See Yourself"},{"id":"34610388","text":"\\"Pure Smokey\\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released in 1976 on his debut album for Dark Horse Records, Thirty Three & 1/3. The song was the second of Harrison's musical tributes to American soul singer Smokey Robinson, following \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\" in 1975. Harrison frequently cited Robinson as one of his favourite vocalists and songwriters, and Robinson's group the Miracles had similarly influenced the Beatles during the 1960s. In the lyrics to \\"Pure Smokey\\", Harrison gives thanks for the gift of Robinson's music, while making a statement regarding the importance of expressing appreciation and gratitude, rather than forgetting to do so and later regretting it. The song title came from the name of Robinson's 1974 album Pure Smokey. Harrison recorded \\"Pure Smokey\\" at his Friar Park home studio in Henley, Oxfordshire. Jazz musician Tom Scott provided production assistance and the song features musical contributions from Scott, Richard Tee, Willie Weeks and Alvin Taylor, together with a pair of highly regarded guitar solos from Harrison. Several reviewers recognise the song as superior to \\"Ooh Baby\\", due in part to its more authentic musical setting; Harrison biographer Simon Leng views the track as its composer's most successful excursion in the soul music genre. \\"Pure Smokey\\" appeared as the B-side to the second single from Thirty Three & 1/3 in the UK, which was Harrison's cover of the Cole Porter standard \\"True Love\\". Background and composition During the Beatles' career, according to author Ian MacDonald, George Harrison had served as the band's \\"scout\\" regarding new American music, particularly soul music.MacDonald, p. 148fn. In 1975, Harrison released Extra Texture, his most soul-influenced album,Rodriguez, pp. 384‚Äì85.Clayson, pp. 348‚Äì49. with songs such as \\"You\\", \\"Can't Stop Thinking About You\\" and \\"The Answer's at the End\\" all demonstrating his adoption of the genre.Leng, pp. 186‚Äì87. Another track, \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\", was a homage to \\"Ooo Baby Baby\\" by Smokey Robinson,Inglis, p. 52.Leng, p. 182. the Miracles' lead singer whose music had a considerable influence on Harrison and John Lennon during the 1960s.Clayson, p. 84.MacDonald, pp. 57‚Äì58, 77‚Äì78, 92. Among the frequent compliments he paid the American singer in interviews, Harrison often praised Robinson as a songwriter,George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 28 July 2013).Badman, pp. 164, 165. noting in his 1980 autobiography, I Me Mine: \\"one tends to forget how many good tunes he has written.\\"Harrison, p. 320. After coming up with the song's \\"nice chord changes\\", as he puts it in I Me Mine, Harrison wrote a more personal musical tribute to Robinson in 1975,Madinger & Easter, p. 455. titled \\"Pure Smokey\\" after Robinson's 1974 album of the same name. In the lyrics to the song's first verse, Harrison acknowledges the tendency to forget to show appreciation for something:Harrison, pp. 319, 320. Smokey Robinson (centre) and the Miracles performing on a 1970 TV special He then refers to all those who have influenced and inspired him musically,Inglis, p. 63. in the line \\"Love that's filled my ears\\", before stating: \\"I want to thank you Lord for giving us Pure Smokey.\\"Allison, p. 153. Harrison offers further praise for Robinson's music in the words \\"Now anyone who hears, hears that voice so free\\",Huntley, p. 148. and in the same middle eight he references the Miracles' hit song \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\". The latter was written by Robinson and, through the Beatles' 1963 cover version, which Robinson himself endorsed in a 1968 interview,. one of Harrison's earliest recorded lead vocals (as a duet with Lennon). In the song's final verse, Harrison compliments what he would describe in a 1987 Musician interview as Robinson's \\"effortless butterfly of a voice\\", as well as his willingness to experiment as an artist: Harrison biographer Simon Leng comments that musically the song reflects \\"many years' flipping of Atlantic and Stax classics\\" by Harrison, as well as his work over 1969‚Äì70 with two soul/R&B; artists signed to the Beatles' Apple record label, Billy Preston and Doris Troy.Leng, p. 196. Christian theologian Dale Allison describes \\"Pure Smokey\\" as a \\"prayer of thanks to God for the music of Smokey Robinson\\". Recording Having fulfilled his contractual obligations to EMI- affiliated Apple Records with Extra Texture,Tillery, pp. 116, 117. Harrison recorded \\"Pure Smokey\\" for his debut album on his Dark Horse record label, Thirty Three & 1/3.Madinger & Easter, pp. 453, 455. Beginning in May 1976, the album sessions took place at FPSHOT, Harrison's home studio at Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.Badman, p. 186. The musicians accompanying him on the track were jazz saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, Richard Tee on Fender Rhodes piano, bassist Willie Weeks and drummer Alvin Taylor.Leng, p. 195. The latter had recently played on 2nd Resurrection by Chicago soul group the Stairsteps,Madinger & Easter, p. 453. one of a number of acts signed to Dark Horse Records since 1974.Clayson, pp. 346‚Äì48. Together with the Taylor‚ÄìWeeks rhythm section,Rodriguez, p. 170. Scott's role as assistant producer on Thirty Three & 1/3 gave the album a sound that was more authentic in the American soul genre compared with Harrison's self-produced Extra Texture.Huntley, pp. 144‚Äì45. Author Michael Frontani describes Taylor and Weeks as \\"one of the best rhythm sections to appear on a Harrison album\\".Frontani, p. 161. The released recording begins with a gradual fade-in, creating an effect that author Elliot Huntley describes as \\"shimmering\\". Over this introduction and during the mid-song instrumental break, Harrison overdubbed electric guitar solos that mark a rare departure from his traditional preference for slide guitar soloing throughout his post-Beatles solo career.Rip Rense, , The Rip Post, 2006 (archived version retrieved 26 October 2013). Overdubs on the track, including Harrison's backing vocals and Scott's various horn parts, were completed by 13 September 1976, after Harrison had been waylaid with hepatitis for much of the summer.Clayson, p. 359.Madinger & Easter, p. 454. Release and reception Thirty Three & 1/3 was released in November 1976, with \\"Pure Smokey\\" appearing as track 3 on side two of the original LP format,Madinger & Easter, p. 635. sequenced between Harrison's remake of the Cole Porter standard \\"True Love\\" and \\"Crackerbox Palace\\".Leng, pp. 195‚Äì96. As with \\"Ooh Baby\\" on Extra Texture,Spizer, p. 274. the album cover included text dedicating the song to Robinson.Woffinden, p. 103. In Britain, \\"Pure Smokey\\" appeared as the B-side to the second single off Thirty Three & 1/3, \\"True Love\\", issued in February 1977.Madinger & Easter, pp. 455, 632. Music critics praised Thirty Three & 1/3 as Harrison's finest work since All Things Must Pass,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188.Schaffner, p. 192. and noted the quality of the production after the more downbeat Dark Horse (1974) and Extra Texture.Carr & Tyler, pp. 120‚Äì21.Woffinden, p. 104. In a review for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman listed the song among \\"plenty of high-spots\\" on the album and commented: \\"Interesting to observe from this how flexible George's vocal styles have now become: he handles ['Pure Smokey'] with a black soul feeling, showing commendable understanding, but without resorting to embarrassing copying techniques.\\"Ray Coleman, \\"Harrison Regains His Rubber Soul\\", Melody Maker, 27 November 1976, p. 23. Although he admired Harrison's guitar work throughout the album, the NMEs Bob Woffinden derided its lyrics and opined that a second Robinson tribute in as many years \\"serves to delineate even more his inability to find fresh material and themes\\".Bob Woffinden, \\"George Harrison: Thirty-Three & 1/3\\", NME, 27 November 1976; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 29 July 2013). Writing in The Beatles Forever in 1977, Nicholas Schaffner included \\"Pure Smokey\\" as an example of Thirty Three & 1/3s standing as \\"the most varied and tuneful collection of Harrison melodies to date\\" and described the song as \\"similar to Extra Textures 'Ooh Baby' but better\\". Among other Beatles biographers, \\"Pure Smokey\\" is viewed as superior to Harrison's previous Robinson tribute.Madinger & Easter, p. 452. Simon Leng considers \\"Pure Smokey\\" to be both \\"the most successful, and succinct, summation of his attachments to the [soul] genre\\" and \\"one of its author's most appealing songs\\".Leng, pp. 195, 196. Leng praises Harrison's guitar solos for their understated, melodic approach ‚Äì in which he detects \\"a nod to Eric Clapton, but with added Carl Perkins twang\\" ‚Äì and concludes: \\"A fact often overlooked is that none of the other Beatles came close to offering convincing soul moods, whereas they were a fundamental part of the Dark Horse's musical vocabulary.\\" Ian Inglis summarises \\"Pure Smokey\\" as \\"a wonderful example of Harrison's obvious affection for sweet soul, both as a singer and a songwriter\\", and includes it among lesser-known Harrison compositions such as \\"Your Love Is Forever\\", \\"Life Itself\\" and \\"That's the Way It Goes\\", all of which are \\"often overlooked\\" yet possess \\"great charm, energy, and beauty\\".Inglis, pp. 63, 141. In the 2005 publication NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, Adrian Thrills named \\"Pure Smokey\\" and \\"See Yourself\\" as two highlights of Thirty Three & 1/3 and placed the former track seventh in his list of Harrison's \\"ten solo gems\\".Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), pp. 22, 23. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow includes \\"Pure Smokey\\" and \\"True Love\\" among the \\"standouts\\" on an album that found its creator with \\"his groove back\\". Snow describes the track as \\"the soul fan George's second and best tribute to the Motown legend\\".Snow, p. 58. Speaking to the music website HazyRock in 2014, Robinson said that he had got to know Harrison in Los Angeles during the 1970s and he was still \\"very flattered\\" by the song.Something Else! staff, \\"Smokey Robinson still thrilled by George Harrison's long-ago tribute: 'A wonderful, flattering thing'\\" , Something Else!, 17 December 2014 (retrieved 4 March 2015).

Harrison wrote the song for Herb Alpert, sometime singer and co-head of A&M; Records, which at the time was the worldwide distributor for Dark Horse. Although the relationship with A&M; soured due to Harrison's failure to deliver Thirty Three & 1/3 on schedule, resulting in litigation and a new distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records, Harrison still dedicated the song to Alpert in the album's liner notes. Music critics note the influence of light jazz and soul in the composition, similar to the work of songwriter Burt Bacharach, and Harrison himself considered \\"Learning How to Love You\\" to be the best song he had written since his much- covered Beatles hit \\"Something\\". The recording features prominent Fender Rhodes piano from New York musician Richard Tee, and a horn and flute arrangement by Tom Scott. The song was also issued as the B-side to Harrison's two US hit singles in 1976‚Äì77, \\"This Song\\" and \\"Crackerbox Palace\\". Background and composition Trumpeter and co-founder of A&M; Records, Herb Alpert, pictured in 1966 A&M; Records, co-founded by American musician and composer Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss in 1962, had a reputation as an \\"artist- friendly\\" international record company, a factor that led to George Harrison agreeing terms with A&M; to serve as distributors for his Dark Horse Records label in May 1974.Clayson, p. 345. Artists such as Ravi Shankar, Splinter, Stairsteps and Attitudes had all recorded for Dark Horse before Harrison was able to sign with A&M; as a Dark Horse act himself,Clayson, pp. 345, 346‚Äì48. following the expiration of his contract with EMI-affiliated Apple Records in January 1976.Badman, pp. 175‚Äì76. Around that time, Harrison and Alpert were working in neighbouring studios at A&M;'s recording facility on La Brea Avenue, Hollywood, when Alpert asked him to provide a song for his forthcoming solo album.Harrison, p. 330. Although Alpert was best known as a trumpeter through his success with the Tijuana Brass, he had a US number 1 hit in 1968 with the original version of \\"This Guy's in Love with You\\", written by Burt Bacharach and lyricist Hal David.Inglis, p. 64. Harrison recalls in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, that he admired Alpert's singing voice, especially on \\"This Guy's in Love with You\\", and so \\"thought I'd try and write a vocal [piece], something with that sort of mood\\". According to Eight Arms to Hold You authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison's working title for the new composition was \\"Herb's Tune\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 455. In her introduction to the 2002 edition of I, Me, Mine, Olivia Harrison notes that it is her handwriting on the original song lyrics for \\"Learning How to Love You\\",Olivia Harrison, \\"Introduction\\", in Harrison, p. 1. which appear on an airmail envelope reproduced in the book.Harrison, p. 331. \\"I wrote the first line of lyrics down for him as he was working out the melody,\\" she writes. \\"Then he took the pen from my hand and wrote words that would later guide him back to the thoughts he wanted to express.\\" These lines became the first verse of what author Alan Clayson describes as a \\"discreetly jazzy\\" song about \\"unconditional spiritual love\\":Clayson, pp. 356, 359. In his book on the religious themes found in Harrison's songs,Inglis, p. 171. Dale Allison views these lyrics as another statement from the singer regarding the inadequacy of words, since it is silence that \\"can help conduct us to the Divine\\".Allison, p. 124. Silence, Allison continues, is \\"a friend to be embraced\\" since \\"We have spiritual senses as well as physical senses ... and the former function best when the latter are temporarily shut down.\\"Allison, pp. 124‚Äì25. The lyrics to the song's middle eight show darkness and stillness as \\"George's spiritual collaborators\\", freeing his attention from what Allison terms \\"this world of divertissement to the numinous world within his heart\\":Allison, p. 125. Harrison biographer Ian Inglis notes that, despite the third verse's acknowledgement of \\"teardrops cloud[ing] the sight\\", \\"the singer is comfortable in the certainty of his emotions\\", declaring in the song's second chorus: \\"Left alone with my heart / I know that I can love you.\\"Harrison, p. 329. In terms of musical structure, Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, identifies \\"Learning How to Love You\\" as marking \\"a new peak of sophistication\\" in its composer's ballad writing.Leng, p. 197. Continuing in the model Harrison established with \\"Something\\" in 1969, and similar to his melody for early-1970s compositions such as \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\", the song's verse-choruses feature a chord pattern that descends one semitone on each bar within the root chord of F# major; but, Leng writes, the melody in \\"Learning How to Love You\\" is \\"longer and subtler\\" than that in \\"Something\\". The middle eight further reflects Harrison's \\"musical erudition\\", according to Leng, with its \\"subtle musical colours invoked by chic major ninth chords\\" common to jazz. Harrison believed that a number of his post-1970 compositions were equal in quality to \\"Something\\", but that the latter song was more widely recognised because it was the Beatles who recorded it.Clayson, p. 283.Huntley, pp. 304‚Äì05. He named \\"Learning How to Love You\\" and the similar-themed \\"Your Love Is Forever\\", from 1979's George Harrison album, as two compositions that he considered were as good as \\"Something\\".Inglis, p. 70. Recording Rather than Alpert, it was Harrison who used the song for his next album, which he would title Thirty Three & 1/3, in honour of both the speed at which an LP record plays and his age when the album was due for release, in June 1976.Schaffner, p. 191. Harrison's other activities delayed the start of recording until late spring that year, however, and sessions began on 24 May at FPSHOT, his home studio at Friar Park in Oxfordshire.Badman, p. 186. Working with Tom Scott as his assistant producer, Harrison taped the basic track for \\"Learning How to Love You\\" with keyboard player Richard Tee, bassist Willie Weeks and drummer Alvin Taylor.Madinger & Easter, pp. 453‚Äì54. While Scott and Weeks were regular contributors to Harrison's projects at this time,Leng, pp. 167, 190.Huntley, pp. 122, 145. Tee came at Scott's recommendation, and Taylor had impressed Harrison with his recent work on Stairsteps' 2nd Resurrection album.Madinger & Easter, p. 454. Progress on Thirty Three & 1/3 was then delayed until the end of the summer due to Harrison suffering a lengthy bout of hepatitis,Woffinden, p. 102. brought about, he admitted, by excessive drinking.Clayson, p. 359. Of the little recording Harrison was able to do during this hiatus, Madinger and Easter write, he overdubbed an acoustic guitar solo on \\"Learning How to Love You\\". Later, Scott added a \\"neat jazz arrangement\\" for saxophones and flutes, and Harrison overdubbed vocals and assorted percussion. Leng also lists Attitudes singer/pianist David Foster as contributing further keyboards to the track. The recording begins with Tee's jazz-inflected Fender Rhodes piano,Huntley, p. 149. which, along with Harrison's electric rhythm guitar, is prominent throughout the song and recalls Tee's work in New York with artists such as Paul Simon and Roberta Flack. Inglis describes the \\"cool, restrained\\" instrumentation on \\"Learning How to Love You\\" as evoking \\"the atmosphere of an intimate, sophisticated nightclub\\". Harrison completed final mixing of the album on 13 September, nearly two months after he was contracted to deliver it to A&M; Records in Los Angeles.Badman, pp. 186, 187. Although the relationship between Harrison and the record company had traditionally been \\"all smiles\\", in Clayson's words,Clayson, pp. 348, 359. Alpert and Moss had invested $3 million in Harrison's fellow Dark Horse signings and seen little in the way of financial returns.Woffinden, p. 103. After realising that the 1974 contract prevented A&M; from cross-collatoralising between Harrison as a solo artist and the Dark Horse acts, Alpert and Moss took legal action against him on 28 September, citing the late delivery of his first album on Dark Horse,Woffinden, pp. 102‚Äì03. and sued Harrison for $10 million.Leng, p. 190.Badman, pp. 193‚Äì94. The news came three weeks after US district court judge Richard Owen had ruled against him in the long-running \\"My Sweet Lord\\"/\\"He's So Fine\\" plagiarism suitWoffinden, pp. 99, 102. and Harrison admitted he was \\"astounded and saddened\\" by A&M;'s move.Badman, pp. 191, 193. The issue was swiftly resolved through him returning his $1 million advance and taking Dark Horse's distribution to Warner Bros. Records,Schaffner, pp. 191‚Äì92. the announcement of which took place on 17 November.Badman, pp. 193‚Äì94, 197. Release and reception Billboard ad announcing Dark Horse's new partnership with Mo Ostin at Warner Bros. Records Warner Bros. released Thirty Three & 1/3 on 19 November 1976 in BritainBadman, p. 198. and 24 November in the United States.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188. \\"Learning How to Love You\\" appeared as the tenth and final track,Madinger & Easter, p. 635. following the Lord Buckley-inspired \\"Crackerbox Palace\\".Rodriguez, p. 170. The song was also issued as the B-side to the album's first single, \\"This Song\\", which was Harrison's send-up of his court appearance in February at the plagiarism hearing,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 132. and to the follow-up single in the US, \\"Crackerbox Palace\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 633. Particularly in America, music critics viewed Thirty Three & 1/3 as Harrison's strongest album since his post-Beatles debut, All Things Must Pass,Carr & Tyler, p. 120. and with Harrison participating in a dedicated promotional campaign for the first time, the consensus was, in the words of author Nicholas Schaffner, that \\"A&M;'s loss proved to be Warner Brothers' gain\\".Schaffner, p. 192. Writing in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Schaffner praised the album's abundance of melodic compositions and the \\"light jazz overtones\\" of \\"Learning How to Love You\\", and concluded: \\"George with Thirty-three and a Third showed himself capable of producing excellent commercial music that conveys his deep spiritual convictions with subtlety and taste to those who wish to hear, without belaboring the point for those who don't.\\" NME critic Bob Woffinden, who had been outspoken in his criticism of the spiritual message in Harrison's previous albums,John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 82. similarly approved of these convictions now being expressed with a more \\"generous and open heart\\"; according to Woffinden, the fact that Harrison dedicated \\"Learning How to Love You\\" to Herb Alpert, despite the recent litigation with A&M; Records, was \\"illustrative of a new spirit\\". Like Schaffner, Beatles author Robert Rodriguez notes A&M;'s folly in missing out on Harrison's \\"strongest collection in years and possibly most commercial ever\\".Rodriguez, p. 169. Rodriguez describes \\"Learning How to Love You\\" as \\"perhaps Harrison's finest pure love song since 'Something'\\" and ranks his acoustic-guitar solo among \\"this ex-Fab's Top 5 all-time instrumental interludes\\".Rodriguez, p. 171. Simon Leng views the composition as one of Harrison's best love songs from the whole of his career and admires the recording as \\"[m]usically, lyrically, and vocally polished\\" with a \\"beautifully flowing\\" mid-song solo.Leng, pp. 197, 198. Leng suggests that Harrison's former bandmate Paul McCartney \\"might have experienced a twinge of envy\\" when listening to the song. Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense has since praised the guitar solo, along with those on tracks such as \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" and the Beatles' \\"Fixing a Hole\\", as examples of how Harrison's playing displays \\"structure, syntax, and development\\" over \\"pyrotechnic flourishes\\". Rense adds: \\"These [guitar solos] are thoughtful and original, deceptively simple sounding, invested with feeling.\\"Rip Rense, \\"There Went the Sun: Reflection on the Passing of George Harrison\\", Beatlefan, 29 January 2002 (retrieved 14 December 2014). Reviewing Harrison's solo releases in 2004, for Blender magazine, Paul Du Noyer considered the song to be one of the album's two \\"standout tracks\\", along with \\"Crackerbox Palace\\".Paul Du Noyer, \\"Back Catalogue: George Harrison\\", Blender, April 2004, pp. 152‚Äì53. Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley views it as a successful attempt to write a Burt Bacharach-type song ‚Äì \\"a sort of 'This Guy's in Love with You' for the 1970s\\" ‚Äì and further evidence of Harrison's \\"mastery of the ballad form\\". In his book The Beatles Solo, former Mojo editor Mat Snow discusses the highlights of Thirty Three & 1/3 and concludes: \\"But perhaps best of all was 'Learning How to Love You,' a delicately serpentine melody full of tender yearning. It was a song from the heart.\\"Snow, p. 58. Guitar World editor Damian Fanelli includes the track's \\"beautiful steel-string solo\\" on his list of Harrison's ten best post-Beatles \\"Guitar Moments\\".Damian Fanelli, \\"George Harrison's 10 Greatest Guitar Moments After the Beatles\\", guitarworld.com, 24 February 2016 (retrieved 28 May 2016).

Category:Dark Horse Records singles ","title":"Learning How to Love You"},{"id":"34610414","text":"\\"Here Comes the Moon\\" is a song by English musician George Harrison from his 1979 album George Harrison. Harrison wrote the song while on holiday on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. His inspiration for the composition was the appearance of the moon in the evening sky, just as the sun was setting. Although the lyrics focus on this natural occurrence rather than on the symbolism it suggests, in the manner of Harrison's Beatles track \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", the song is seen as a sequel to that similarly titled piece. Harrison recorded \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" at his home studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire. Reflecting the circumstances of the song's creation, the recording features a lush musical arrangement that includes acoustic and slide guitars, layered harmony vocals, orchestral strings, and sitar drone. An edited version of the track appeared on his 1989 compilation Best of Dark Horse. Harrison's solo demo of the song was included as a bonus track on the 2004 reissue of George Harrison. Background and inspiration George Harrison wrote \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" while in HanaClayson, p. 368. on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978.Harry, pp. 188, 227. The purpose of the visit was partly to write material for his first album in two years, titled simply George Harrison,Madinger & Easter, p. 457. and partly for Harrison and his girlfriend, Olivia Arias, to enjoy a holiday after learning that they were to become parents for the first time. As with several of the songs on the album,Rodriguez, pp. 365‚Äì66. Harrison drew inspiration for \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" from his surroundings on Maui.Clayson, pp. 367‚Äì68. In his 1980 autobiography, I Me Mine, he recalls seeing \\"marvellous\\" sunsets there and regularly sighting whales. On this particular occasion, Harrison adds, \\"the full moon was coming up as the sun was going down ‚Äì all this and here comes the moon! Too much.\\"Harrison, p. 354. His experience was heightened by the effects of either LSD or magic mushrooms,Huntley, p. 166.Allison, p. 144. the last of which provided inspiration for another new song, \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\".Tillery, p. 121. Harrison's handwritten lyrics for \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" are dated 25 February, the day of his 35th birthday.Harrison, p. 6. The song's nature-related theme matches that of much of his previous work, including \\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Blow Away\\".Leng, pp. 42, 96, 203, 205. Due to the similarity of its title with \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", the song has invited interpretation as a sequel to that 1969 Harrison composition.Rodriguez, p. 176. Author Ian Inglis writes that the two songs differ significantly, however, in that while \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" adopts the arrival of sunshine as a metaphor for hope and an end to a dark emotional mood, \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" focuses purely on the moment itself, rather than what the moon's appearance might suggest.Inglis, p. 67. While also viewing the songs as having little in common aside from their titles, Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers that \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" shares the earlier composition's theme of escape.Leng, p. 204. According to singer Stevie Nicks, she spent time with Harrison in Hana during this period and helped him write the lyrics for the song.Something Else! staff, \\"'My inspiration every single night': Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks keeps photo of George Harrison nearby\\", Something Else!, 14 January 2014 (retrieved 24 November 2017). Composition As with all the songs on George Harrison, music journalist John Metzger considers \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" to be in the folk pop style. The composition includes a series of descending guitar arpeggios before the start of each verse. The time signature is 6/8 over these guitar passages and the similarly descending choruses, and 4/4 over the verses and the middle eight.\\"Here Comes the Moon\\", in George Harrison George Harrison: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Warner Bros. Music (New York, NY, 1979). In his lyrics, Harrison conveys a state of wonder at the natural world. He celebrates the arrival of the moonAllison, p. 90. and rues that many people ignore its presence. He describes it as both \\"a little brother to the sun\\" and \\"mother to the stars at night\\", and comments on the heightened impulse it stimulates throughout the natural world during the full moon phase.Harrison, p. 356. In the middle eight, he terms the moon's arrival \\"God's gift\\", in that it mirrors light to the world.Allison, p. 74. According to Leng, the song presents a \\"mystical never-never land of natural purity\\" that recalls the message and imagery first conveyed by Harrison in his 1970 composition \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\". Recording Harrison recorded \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" during sessions held between March and October 1978 at his FPSHOT studio in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.Leng, p. 199.Badman, p. 221. He produced the album with Russ Titelman, a Warner Bros. staff producerSnow, p. 64. whose previous projects included Ry Cooder's Chicken Skin Music,Leng, pp. 200‚Äì01. a 1976 album that reflected Cooder's adoption of Hawaiian musical influences.Brett Hartenbach, \\"Ry Cooder Chicken Skin Music\\", AllMusic (retrieved 9 November 2016). Aside from Harrison, the musicians on the track were keyboard players Neil Larsen and Steve Winwood, percussionist Ray Cooper and the rhythm section of Willie Weeks (bass) and Andy Newmark (drums).Leng, pp. 200, 203. Typical of the mellow sound on George Harrison,Rodriguez, pp. 175, 286.Leng, p. 200. Harrison played acoustic guitar on the track and overdubbed lead parts on slide guitar.Huntley, pp. 164, 168. Orchestral strings for this and other songs on the album were arranged by Del NewmanHarry, p. 188. and recorded at AIR Studios in London.Madinger & Easter, pp. 457, 458. In the opinion of authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, the completed track's ethereal quality reflects its composer's \\"altered sensibilities\\" and the circumstances that inspired the song. Leng notes signs of Harrison's \\"Beatles heritage\\", citing as one example the multi-layered backing vocals that Harrison and Winwood perform, which he says \\"invok[e] the majesty of 'Because'\\". Author Alan Clayson also comments on the song's 1960s references, including the vocalised \\"oh yeah\\"s and the subtle use of sitar drone. Harrison discussed \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" when he appeared as a guest, along with Michael Jackson, on the BBC Radio 1 show Roundtable on 9 February 1979.Badman, p. 229. Harrison said it was a track he enjoyed and that while completing the mixing of the album he would get so relaxed when listening to it that he almost fell asleep each time.Harry, p. 82. Release George Harrison was released on the artist's Dark Horse record label on 20 February 1979.Madinger & Easter, p. 635. \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" appeared as the third track on the album, sequenced between \\"Not Guilty\\" and \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\".Inglis, p. 150. That same year, Harrison furthered his ties to Hawaii when he bought Kuppu Qulua,Harry, p. 225. a property in Nahiku, near Hana.Rodriguez, p. 424. \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" was included on the 1989 compilation album Best of Dark Horse, the content of which partly reflected Harrison's personal preferencesHuntley, p. 224.Inglis, pp. 99, 129. by omitting some of his hit singles in favour of album tracks.Madinger & Easter, pp. 477, 637.

When Harrison's Dark Horse albums were remastered for his posthumous Dark Horse Years reissue campaign in 2004, an acoustic demo of \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" appeared as the sole bonus track on the George Harrison CD.John Metzger, \\"George Harrison The Dark Horse Years (Part Two: George Harrison)\\", The Music Box, vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 5 November 2016).Huntley, pp. 334‚Äì35. This selection was again at Harrison's request, since he had chosen the bonus tracks for the reissues before his death in November 2001.Leng, pp. 312‚Äì13. The expanded CD booklet included a photo of Harrison writing the song on acoustic guitar.George Harrison CD booklet (2004), Dark Horse Records, p. 2.\\"Album: George Harrison\\" > image 2, georgeharrison.com (retrieved 7 November 2016). In his liner-note essay in the Dark Horse Years box set, music critic David Fricke cited \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" as his personal best rediscovery among Harrison's long-unavailable Dark Horse catalogue, describing it as a \\"gorgeous sequel\\" to \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" \\"with milky-waterfall harmonies in the chorus line\\".David Fricke, \\"George Harrison Dark Horse\\", The Dark Horse Years 1976‚Äì1992 box-set booklet, Dark Horse Records, p. 23. Critical reception Among contemporary reviews of George Harrison, Billboard described \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" as a song \\"inspired by the sublime atmosphere\\" of Hawaii and ranked it as the second of the album's \\"best cuts\\", after \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\".Ed Harrison (ed.), \\"Billboard's Top Album Picks\\", Billboard, 24 February 1979, p. 80 (retrieved 5 November 2016). In Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden admired Harrison and Titelman for creating the artist's leanest and most buoyant musical arrangements yet. While recognising the album's avoidance of contemporary pop styles, he grouped the song with \\"Not Guilty\\" and \\"Soft- Hearted Hana\\" as tracks that \\"transport us back into psychedelic lotus land, but their tone is so airy and whimsical that the nostalgia is as seductive as it is anachronistic\\".Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison: George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979, p. 90 (retrieved 5 November 2016). Writing in Melody Maker, E.J. Thribb said it was an album that \\"grows in its effect after a few plays\\" and concluded that with this and other songs, Harrison had \\"brought both sunshine and moonshine into our lives\\". Greg Kot's assessment for Rolling Stone in 2002 read in part: \\"'Here Comes the Moon' is a dreamy little wonder, the kind of incantation that underscores the [album's] romantic subtlety ‚Ä¶\\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188. Among reviews of the 2004 reissue, PopMatters' Jason Korenkiewicz recognised \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" as one of the standout tracks, describing it as a \\"dreamy psychedelic sing-a- long\\" on an album that reflected Harrison's \\"new found sense of calm and peace\\",Jason Korenkiewicz, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse Years 1976‚Äì1992\\", PopMatters, 2 May 2004 (retrieved 5 November 2016). while Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone said it was one of the \\"memorably lilting tunes\\" that made George Harrison the artist's \\"midcareer peak\\".Parke Puterbaugh, \\"By George\\", Rolling Stone, 3 April 2004, p. 68. Conversely, Richard Ginell of AllMusic deems George Harrison to be \\"an ordinary album from an extraordinary talent\\", and he dismisses the track as \\"a lazy retake\\" on \\"Here Comes the Sun\\".Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison George Harrison\\", AllMusic (retrieved 5 November 2016). Former Mojo editor Mat Snow includes \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" among the album's best tracks, which he describes as \\"romantic and reflective\\" and, thanks largely to Titelman's involvement, \\"tastefully contemporary\\".Snow, p. 68. Writing on his website Elsewhere, New Zealand Herald critic Graham Reid considers the song to be a \\"lovely\\" track, yet also, in its drawing on a similar theme to \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", a sign that Harrison's inspiration was waning.Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part Two (2014): The dark horse at a canter to the end\\" > \\"George Harrison\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 [22 November 2011] (retrieved 5 November 2016). Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez states that, as with \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\" (Harrison's titular sequel to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"), such comparisons are unfounded and reflective of music critics' overly reverential approach to the Beatles' work.Rodriguez, pp. 176, 280. Rodriguez adds: \\"Even had the earlier song never been written, 'Moon' would still stand as a lovely, lyrical evocation of the lunar orb and the emotion it stirs.\\" Personnel According to Simon Leng:Leng, pp. 203‚Äì04. *George Harrison ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitars, slide guitars, sitar, backing vocals * Neil Larsen ‚Äì electric piano * Steve Winwood ‚Äì harmonium, backing vocals *Willie Weeks ‚Äì bass * Andy Newmark ‚Äì drums * Ray Cooper ‚Äì percussion * Del Newman ‚Äì string arrangement References Sources * Dale C.

The probable causation of the crash was described thus: \\"The instrument flight training manuals show that the Linea Aeropostal Venezolana has approved a procedure for entering Maiquetia in semi-IFR conditions. This procedure consists (of) maintaining a minimum flight level of 10,000 feet as far as the station (Miq 292.5), then turning north over this point and continuing on a 360¬∫ heading for 4 minutes, followed by a standard let-down to 1,200 feet above sea level until contact is established, and a return to the aerodrome under VFR. It is obvious that the pilot-in-command did not fully comply with this procedure, and, after accumulating errors in estimating his speed, endeavoured to make a direct approach which proved fatal because his altitude at the time of his last report was insufficient to cross the Avila mountain range, against which the impact occurred.\\" References External links *Description at AirDisaster.com Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1956 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Lockheed Constellation Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by weather Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Venezuela Category:1956 in Venezuela 253 Category:November 1956 events ","title":"Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Flight 253 (November 1956)"},{"id":"34610438","text":"Borghild Olavsdatter (fl. 1115), was the Norwegian royal mistress of King Sigurd the Crusader (c. 1090 ‚Äì 1130) and the mother of King Magnus IV of Norway (ca. 1115 ‚Äì 1139). She probably lived within the period 1090 to 1150 and was one of few Christian women mentioned in Heimskringla by Snorre Sturlasson. Borghild was the daughter of a wealthy farmer who owned the farm Stordal (Store-Dal i Skjeberg) in the parish of Skjeberg in √òstfold. One winter, King Sigurd spent a period as a guest of her father. The close friendship which developed between Borghild and Sigurd gave rise to rumours that they were lovers.

In North America, it was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single, \\"Blow Away\\", while in Britain and some other markets it was the B-side of the follow-up, \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\". The lyrics recall Harrison's experiences under the hallucinatory effects of magic mushrooms while holidaying on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The song title refers to Hana, a remote town on the island, and is a play on that of the 1920s ragtime tune \\"Hard Hearted Hannah\\". Harrison began writing the song in Los Angeles in response to Ted Templeman, a staff producer at Warner Bros. Records, suggesting he compose something in a similar style to his 1971 track \\"Deep Blue\\". He wrote the lyrics in Hawaii in February 1978, during the main writing period for George Harrison, his first album in over two years. Recorded at Harrison's FPSHOT studio in Oxfordshire, the track features dobro, jazz piano, tuba and prominent chorus vocals, as well as voices and sounds captured in his local pub. The musical arrangement recalls the music hall tradition, while the composition's old-time qualities reflect Harrison's earliest influences from the pre-rock and roll era. The other musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Stevie Winwood. The song's lyrics employ, variously, psychedelic imagery, rhyming slang, humorous non sequiturs and John Keats-like symbolism. The song was well received by several music critics and revealed a comedic side of Harrison that was relatively unfamiliar to listeners. Author Simon Leng recognises \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" as the start of the \\"Pythonization of Harrison's music\\",Leng, p. 226. referring to the Monty Python comedy troupe and Harrison's role as a film producer of British comedies such as Monty Python's Life of Brian. Background and inspiration Having taken most of 1977 off to travel with the Formula 1 World Championship,Huntley, p. 153. George Harrison decided to record a new album of songs to satisfy the demands of his racing driver friendsHarry, p. 188. and to repay the patience of Warner Bros. Records, the company that distributed his Dark Horse record label.Mick Brown, \\"A Conversation With George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979 (archived version retrieved 23 November 2017). During a conversation about the album in Los Angeles with the company's executives,Harry, p. 347. Ted Templeman, a Warner's staff producer, expressed his admiration for \\"Deep Blue\\", the B-side of Harrison's 1971 single \\"Bangla Desh\\", and suggested he write another song in that style. Harrison came up with the music for the new song that night, using similar chords to \\"Deep Blue\\".Harrison, p. 352. He said that it was a \\"more 'up'\\" tune than \\"Deep Blue\\", which was \\"down\\" and written about his mother's deterioration from cancer, but he was unable to find the right lyrics at first.Harrison, pp. 212, 352. Harrison then went to Hana on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978, where he finished the song during a fruitful period for his songwriting.Madinger & Easter, p. 457.Rodriguez, pp. 175, 365‚Äì66.Harry, pp. 188, 227, 347. He titled it \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" after the town of Hana, and as a play on the title of \\"Hard Hearted Hannah (The Vamp of Savannah)\\".Rodriguez, p. 177. The latter was a 1920s ragtime standardInglis, p. 68. that Harrison had become familiar with through a 1961 recording by the Temperance Seven, which was produced by George Martin, the Beatles' producer. Harrison's inspiration for the \\"crazy\\" lyrics came from ingesting magic mushrooms, which he said was his first experience of hallucinogenic drugs for perhaps ten years. He also wrote \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" during this time, drawing inspiration again from the lush natural surroundings on MauiHarrison, p. 6.Rodriguez, pp. 365‚Äì66. and from the magic mushrooms.Clayson, p. 368.Tillery, p. 121.Timothy White, \\"George Harrison ‚Äì Reconsidered\\", Musician, November 1987, p. 55. Another new composition was \\"Sooty Goes to Hawaii\\",Badman, p. 219. a comedy song that Harrison wrote about Sooty, the popular glove puppet character from British television.Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 18. Olivia Harrison ‚Äì Harrison's girlfriend at the time, and soon to be his wife ‚Äì recalls that this visit represented the start of their \\"love affair with Hawaii\\", as well as providing the inspiration for \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" and other songs on the 1979 album George Harrison.Harrison, pp. 4, 6. Composition Haleakala crater on Maui. Author Simon Leng says that \\"Soft- Hearted Hana\\" was Harrison's \\"first obvious drug song\\" since his 1967 composition for the Beatles \\"It's All Too Much\\". He recognises the mood as similar to Harrison's rustic, Band-inspired songs on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass,Leng, pp. 204‚Äì05. while author Robert Rodriguez describes the song as old-time music. In the lyrics, Harrison recounts his episode under the influence of mushrooms, and recalls their hallucinatory powers. Among the psychedelic imagery he employs, he describes the sensation of feeling elevated far above the ground, with his legs appearing to be \\"like high-rise buildings\\" and his head so \\"high up in the sky\\" that he began to \\"fry like bacon\\".Harrison, p. 351. Author Ian Inglis identifies several \\"Dylanesque characters\\" in the narrative, including \\"Richard III\\", \\"Seven naked native girls\\" and \\"Lone-ranger smoking doobies\\". Another individual asks Harrison whether they had not just met \\"up on Haleakala\\", referring to the volcanic crater overlooking Hana.Clayson, pp. 367‚Äì68. These phrases appear in the song's two middle-eights, which are separated by an instrumental passage played over the same chord sequence as the verses. Inglis comments that whereas Harrison's songs from earlier in the 1970s \\"Simply Shady\\" and \\"Tired of Midnight Blue\\" offer a self-rebuke on drug-taking, the singer reacts to the characters he encounters in \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" with the statement: \\"I'm still smiling.\\" Leng notes the effectiveness of the rhyming slang in Harrison's reference to Richard III, and says that the second middle eight represents \\"the longest string of deliberate non sequiturs\\" in Harrison's oeuvre: The song also reflects Harrison's appreciation of the lush tropical vegetation of Maui. In the final verse, the narrative changes as Harrison sings earnestly of his new, idyllic home, referring to Hana as \\"she\\". He pictures the town \\"beneath the crater, in the meadow\\" and surrounded by vegetation. Inglis likens Harrison's female personification of Hana amid \\"fruit and grain\\" to a literary device employed by English poet John Keats in his \\"Ode to Autumn\\". He cites this similarity when concluding that \\"comparisons between the Beatles and the young Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century (Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and Keats, among others) may legitimately extend to their creative use of language, as well as their public fascination.\\" Recording The sessions for the album took place at Harrison's studio, FPSHOT, in OxfordshireLeng, p. 199.Badman, p. 221. between March and September 1978, and coincided with a period of tranquility in his lifeMadinger & Easter, p. 457. as he and Arias awaited the birth of their first child.Rodrigeuz, pp. 175, 365. Rather than with Templeman, Harrison produced the album with Russ Titelman, another Warner Bros. staff producer.Snow, p. 64.Rodriguez, p. 366. Titelman's previous projects included Ry Cooder's Chicken Skin Music,Leng, pp. 200‚Äì01. a 1976 album that reflected Cooder's adoption of Hawaiian musical influences.Brett Hartenbach, \\"Ry Cooder Chicken Skin Music\\", AllMusic (retrieved 9 November 2016). The musicians accompanying Harrison on \\"Soft- Hearted Hana\\" were keyboard player Neil Larsen and the rhythm section of Willie Weeks (bass) and Andy Newmark (drums).Leng, pp. 200, 203. The horns for this and other songs on the album were arranged by Del NewmanHarry, p. 188. and recorded at AIR Studios in London.Madinger & Easter, pp. 457, 458. As on \\"Deep Blue\\" in 1971, the lead instrument on \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" is a dobro, played by Harrison.Leng, pp. 113‚Äì14, 204. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter consider the song's arrangement to be in the music hall tradition, aside from the inclusion of the dobro.Madinger & Easter, p. 458. The piano part was performed by Larsen in the style of ragtime pianist Jelly Roll Morton. Newman's horn arrangement included a prominent tuba part, while chorus vocals on the \\"I'm still smiling\\" middle-eights were sung by Harrison and Steve Winwood. The singalong mood of the track was furthered by the inclusion of spoken voices and background sounds, evoking a party scene. These parts were recorded at Harrison's local pub in Henley-on-Thames,Edward Rivadavia, \\"Revisiting George Harrison's 1979 Self-Titled Album\\", Ultimate Classic Rock, 21 February 2014 (retrieved 25 November 2017). the Row Barge. At the end of the song, the recording was subjected to heavy varispeeding, creating dramatic changes in pitch during the fade-out. Release and reception George Harrison was released on Dark Horse Records on 20 February 1979.Madinger & Easter, p. 635. \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" was sequenced as the fourth track, between \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" and the album's lead single, \\"Blow Away\\".Inglis, p. 150. In North America, \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" was issued as the B-side of \\"Blow Away\\", which was released on 16 February.Badman, p. 229. In Britain, it appeared as the B-side of the follow-up single, \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\",Badman, p. 231. which was originally scheduled as the lead single there.Madinger & Easter, pp. 457, 633. That same year, Harrison furthered his ties to Hawaii when he bought Kuppu Qulua,Harry, p. 225. a property in Nahiku, near Hana.Rodriguez, p. 424. In the album credits, he dedicated \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" to Bob Longhi,Sleeve credits, George Harrison LP (Dark Horse Records, 1979; produced by George Harrison & Russ Titelman).Timothy Hurley, \\"Maui gave ex-Beatle Harrison the quiet he craved\\", The Honolulu Advertiser, 1 December 2001 (retrieved 24 November 2017). who owned Longhi's restaurant in Lahaina, on the opposite side of Maui from Hana.Clayson, p. 368. Harrison did minimal promotion for the album,Clayson, p. 369.Rodriguez, p. 175. content to let the music make its mark as he focused on establishing HandMade Films to finance Monty Python's Life of Brian and other Python-related film projects.Snow, p. 68.Woffinden, pp. 104, 106. The album received favourable reviews from music critics.Huntley, p. 169.Rodriguez, p. 392. In Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden wrote: \\"George Harrison is refreshingly lighthearted ... The arrangements are the most concise and springy to be found on any Harrison record. \\"Not Guilty,\\" \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" and \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" transport us back into psychedelic lotus land, but their tone is so airy and whimsical that the nostalgia is as seductive as it is anachronistic.\\"Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison: George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979, p. 90 (retrieved 23 November 2017). Writing in Melody Maker, E.J. Thribb also welcomed the release, saying that \\"light-heartedness seems to infiltrate the music on this album, almost to the point of light-headedness\\", and he added of \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\": \\"Eric Clapton first played me this a while back, and chuckled gently over the curious wobble speeds employed in the final chorus ‚Ä¶ If you're not ready for it, you could fear your turntable has developed Parkinson's Disease.\\"E.J. Thribb, \\"George Harrison: George Harrison (Dark Horse)\\", Melody Maker, 24 February 1979, p. 29.Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles ‚Äì The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 122. Harry George of the NME credited Harrison's happiness with Olivia as the impetus for an album that was \\"a revelation compared to its predecessors\\" and he praised Harrison's guitar playing, saying: \\"'Soft-Hearted Hana' finds our hero out of his box at a party, McCartneyesque backing vocals and bucolic bottleneck showing a lightness of touch not seen in years. Ideal for poolside or fireside.\\"Harry George, \\"George Harrison George Harrison (Dark Horse)\\", NME, 24 February 1979, p. 22. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden rated the production, musicianship and musical arrangements throughout the album as the equal of the Beatles' work and said that the song \\"showed a facility [in Harrison] for switching style and mood that, again, rendered comparisons with the Beatles not at all invidious\\".Woffinden, p. 106. Retrospective assessment and legacy In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Richard Ginell was unimpressed by the album but he recognised \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" as one of the rare \\"quirks\\" among a mostly bland collection of songs and \\"a strange, stream- of-consciousness Hawaiian hallucination\\".Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison George Harrison\\", AllMusic (retrieved 23 November 2017). Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham said that George Harrison was worth the two-year wait and, just as \\"Blow Away\\" \\"perfectly conveys the breezy change of mood\\" Harrison had undergone, \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" \\"jazzily details his experience with magic mushrooms\\".Ingham, pp. 135‚Äì36. Among Harrison and Beatles biographers, Simon Leng views the song as the first instalment of the \\"Pythonization of Harrison's music\\", the \\"culmination\\" of which came with the 1981 track \\"Save the World\\". Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as an early indication of Harrison's fondness for popular music from the pre- rock and roll era. They remark on its significance as an original composition, rather than an updated cover in the manner of Harrison's version of the Cole Porter standard \\"True Love\\", which Harrison released on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3. Harrison subsequently indulged his love of 1930s jazz,Huntley, pp. 200‚Äì01. specifically Cab Calloway, in two of the songs he wrote for the soundtrack of the 1986 HandMade comedy Shanghai Surprise: \\"Hottest Gong in Town\\", which again features a Morton-style piano part,Leng, p. 244. and \\"Zig Zag\\".Inglis, pp. 94, 103. Robert Rodriguez says that \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" is one of the \\"standout tunes\\" on an album that ranks among the best Beatle solo releases of the 1970‚Äì1980 period.Rodriguez, pp. 144, 177. While he credits Titelman with reining in Harrison's \\"increasingly idiosyncratic\\" tendencies at a time when his music had little in common with contemporary rock and pop trends, Rodriguez expresses surprise that Harrison did not play ukulele on the track, given his attachment to the instrument and to Hawaii.Rodriguez, pp. 177, 366.

Category:Songs about drugs ","title":"Soft-Hearted Hana"},{"id":"34610461","text":"\\"Soft Touch\\" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1979 album George Harrison. It was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single, \\"Blow Away\\", in Britain and some other countries, while in markets such as North America, it was the B-side of the second single, \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\". Harrison wrote the song while in the Virgin Islands with his future wife, Olivia Arias, shortly before recording his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3. The song is a love song in which Harrison also conveys his wonder at the idyllic island setting. Harrison recorded \\"Soft Touch\\" in 1978 at his home studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire. The track includes synthesizer contributions from Steve Winwood and was co-produced by Harrison and Russ Titelman. Background and composition George Harrison began writing \\"Soft Touch\\" in March 1976 while holidaying with his girlfriend, Olivia Arias, in the Virgin Islands.Allison, p. 155. The holiday served as a songwriting session for Harrison's first album on his Dark Horse record label, Thirty Three & 1/3, and also as an escape from the problems he faced with the copyright infringement suit relating to his 1970 hit song \\"My Sweet Lord\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 453. The title for \\"Soft Touch\\" came from American musician Jim Keltner, who used to call Harrison a \\"soft touch\\" because of his generosity towards his friends and fellow musicians.Harrison, p. 4. Sunset at Caneel Bay in the Virgin Islands Harrison based the melody on the horn line in his 1970 track \\"Run of the Mill\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 458. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, he recalls that the new composition originated from his playing the horn part on a guitar. He says that the song's lyrics convey \\"everything that was going on in the Islands ‚Ä¶ the wind, the cool breeze blowing, the palm trees, the new moon rising\\".Harrison, p. 344. As with the early drafts of \\"It's What You Value\\", which was also inspired by his friendship with Keltner,Rodriguez, p. 81.Clayson, pp. 358‚Äì59. the handwritten lyrics are reproduced in I, Me, Mine on stationery from the Caneel Bay Plantation in Virgin Islands National Park.Harrison, pp. 323‚Äì24, 345‚Äì47. In her foreword to the 2002 edition of I, Me, Mine, Olivia Harrison refers to Harrison's brief commentary on \\"Soft Touch\\" as an example of how his handwritten notes reveal significant details that may not be apparent at first glance. She comments on his inclusion of the phrase \\"Bridge (noch ein mal)\\", which uses the German for \\"One more time\\", a phrase that the Beatles took to calling out to each other on stage during their shows in Hamburg in the early 1960s. As further background to \\"Soft Touch\\", she recalls that she and Harrison were joined in the Virgin Islands by comedian Eric Idle of Monty Python, and that the noise they created attracted complaints from television producer Norman Lear and his wife, activist and journalist Frances Lear, who were staying in the neighbouring house. Olivia adds that, once the Lears learned that it was George Harrison who was responsible for the loud music, Norman Lear \\"again knocked on our door, this time apologising and pleading for George to play as much music as he liked\\".Harrison, p. 5. \\"Soft Touch\\" is a secular love song and, in the view of theologian Dale Allison, lacks the religious aspect commonly found in Harrison's love songs.Allison, pp. 12, 155. Author Ian Inglis writes that whereas the term \\"soft touch\\" usually refers to someone who is easy to convince, in Harrison's song, it describes \\"a caring and gentle nature\\", with the lyrics evoking \\"physical and emotional tenderness\\".Inglis, p. 70. He says that the words work in tandem with the music, which includes a \\"delicate\\" descending riff.Inglis, pp. 70, 71. Inglis describes the narrative as a mix of \\"warm contentment\\", through phrases such as \\"eyes that shine\\", \\"treetops whisper\\" and \\"a new moon\\", and the idyllic surroundings, evoked through the references to ocean waves and sailing. Recording Harrison did not include \\"Soft Touch\\" on Thirty Three & 1/3 but recorded it in 1978 for his next album, George Harrison.Badman, pp. 186, 221. In the intervening years, he had increasingly sought out activities outside music,Leng, p. 210.Tillery, pp. 118‚Äì20. which included travel with Arias,Huntley, p. 153. compiling material for his autobiography,Madinger & Easter, p. 454. and participating in Idle's comedy projects.Woffinden, p. 104.

Andy Newmark, who played drums on the song, described Harrison as \\"a new George\\" and \\"only mellower\\" compared with when they had worked together in 1974Leng, p. 201. ‚Äì a year when Harrison had exhausted himself through his commitment to launching Dark Horse Records in conjunction with his first concert tour as a solo artist.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44.Snow, pp. 47‚Äì48. Although most of the album was written on the Hawaian island of Maui in February 1978, \\"Soft Touch\\" fitted the tropical theme of Harrison's more recent material.Clayson, pp. 367‚Äì68. Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes the musical arrangement as having \\"lashings of acoustic and Hawaiian [slide] guitars\\",Huntley, p. 168. while author Alan Clayson considers it to be more evocative of Maui than other tracks on the album, with the song \\"transmitt[ing] the blue curvature of the ocean\\" through the \\"swoop\\" of Harrison's guitar riffs.Clayson, p. 368. Simon Leng comments that the arrangement, particularly the guitar parts, mirrors that of the song \\"Round and Round\\" from Splinter's final album for Dark Horse, Two Man Band.Leng, p. 208. He also cites \\"Soft Touch\\" as an example of Harrison adopting a less American sound in his work; referring to Ray Cooper's conga playing on the track, Leng writes: \\"he sounds English, not Cuban; like Cooper, not Armando Peraza.\\"Leng, p. 200. Release George Harrison was released on Dark Horse Records on 20 February 1979.Madinger & Easter, p. 635. \\"Soft Touch\\" was sequenced as the penultimate track, between \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" and \\"If You Believe\\".Inglis, p. 150. Inglis recognises it as the last song in a trilogy of tracks that \\"celebrate his newfound domestic bliss\\", after \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" and \\"Your Love Is Forever\\".Inglis, pp. 69‚Äì70. In Britain, \\"Soft Touch\\" was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single, \\"Blow Away\\", on 16 February.Badman, p. 229. In North America, it instead appeared as the B-side of the follow-up single, \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\",Badman, p. 231. which was originally scheduled as the lead single.Madinger & Easter, pp. 457, 633. Harrison did minimal promotion for the album,Clayson, p. 369.Rodriguez, p. 175. content to let the music make its mark as he focused on establishing HandMade Films to finance Monty Python's Life of Brian and other Python-related film projects.Snow, p. 68.Woffinden, pp. 104, 106. In an interview with Mick Brown, for Rolling Stone, Harrison said he was pleased with all the songs on the album but identified \\"Soft Touch\\" and \\"If You Believe\\" as the ones he was least impressed by. He said that \\"Soft Touch\\" was \\"just pleasant but there's nothing special about it, I feel.\\"Mick Brown, \\"A Conversation With George Harrison\\", Rolling Stone, 19 April 1979 (retrieved 12 August 2017). The title of the song was adopted for an international Harrison fanzine that was produced in Glasgow. The publication turned its scope to cover all the former Beatles in the early 1980s, however, due to Harrison's withdrawal from the public eye following John Lennon's murder in New York.Clayson, p. 404. Leng views \\"Soft Touch\\" as another \\"instalment of South Seas bliss\\" from Harrison and indicative of the artist's avoidance of all contemporary musical trends on his self-titled 1979 album. Leng adds that the song would have held little appeal to rock critics at the time but instead satisfied the criteria outlined by Harrison's friends among the Formula 1 community, for \\"nice, relaxing music\\".Leng, pp. 208‚Äì09. Inglis admires the synergy of lyrics and music on the song as \\"effortless and entirely natural\\", and adds: \\"While contemporary genres such as punk and heavy metal sometimes found it difficult to blend intimate, romantic messages with sympathetic musical accompaniments, Harrison seems to have achieved a near- seamless blend of the two.\\" He recognises Harrison's co-producer, Russ Titelman, and the playing of backing musicians such as Steve Winwood as equally responsible for this achievement, saying that their contributions contrasted with the extravagance heard on some of Harrison's early 1970s work and so matched his requirement for \\"a less aggressive, and more subtle, musical philosophy\\" from 1976 onwards.Inglis, pp. 70‚Äì71.

In the first half of the twelfth century, Eysteinn was brought to Norway and claimed to be the son of his royal predecessor, Haraldr gilli, King of Norway. The latter was himself the son of a Gaelic woman, and claimed to be the son of an earlier king. The claims of Bja√∞«´k and Eysteinn were accepted, and the latter went on to rule as king for fifteen years. Bja√∞«´k's name could to be an Old Norse form of a Gaelic name, and she may well have been a member of a prominent family. According to modern tradition, Haraldr gilli's wife was an aunt of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles, although whether this tradition is authentic is uncertain. Norwegian royal family Eysteinn's mother Nineteenth-century depiction of Bja√∞«´k's son, Eysteinn Haraldsson.Hollander (2011) p. 766 ch. 32; Storm (1899) p. 614. Eysteinn Haraldsson (died 1157) was a son of Bja√∞«´k and Haraldr gilli, King of Norway (died 1136).Gade (2009) p. lxxx. Following Haraldr gilli's death, two of his sons, Sigur√∞r munnr (died 1155) and Ingi (died 1161), jointly ruled the Norwegian realm as kings.Taylor (1965) p. 121. According to Haraldssona saga within the thirteenth-century saga-compilation Heimskringla, in 1142 Eysteinn and Bja√∞«´k were brought to Norway from west- over-sea by three prominent men of the realm: √Årni sturla, √ûorleifr Brynj√≥lfsson, and Kolbeinn hr√∫ga. Eysteinn was thence put forward as an adult son of Haraldr gilli who deserved a share of the kingdom. Once his claim was accepted, Eysteinn was recognised as king.Finlay; Faulkes (2015) p. 197 ch. 13; Hollander (2011) pp. 749‚Äì750 ch. 13; Gade (2009) p. 552; Antonsson (2007) p. 173; Salvucci (2005) p. 162; Sellar (1966) pp. 129‚Äì130; Anderson (1922) pp. 204‚Äì205; J√≥nsson (1911) p. 581 ch. 13; Storm (1899) pp. 599‚Äì600 ch. 13; Unger (1868) pp. 737‚Äì738 ch. 13; Laing (1844) p. 252 ch. 13. The thirteenth-century texts FagrskinnaSalvucci (2005) p. 162; Finlay (2004) p. 269 ch. 99; J√≥nsson (1903) p. 351 ch. 84. and Morkinskinna give similar accounts although these sources do not identify Bja√∞«´k by name.Andersson; Gade (2012) p. 389 ch. 95; Salvucci (2005) p. 162; J√≥nsson (1932) p. 440 ch. 80; Unger (1867) p. 223. In fact, her name appears to correspond to either the Gaelic Blathach,Finlay; Faulkes (2015) p. 265; Power (2005) p. 21 n. 20; Craigie (1897) p. 444. Bl√°th√≥c,Sellar (1966) p. 130 n. 1; Anderson (1922) p. 205 n. 1. or Beth√≥c.Power (2005) p. 21; Sellar (1966) p. 130. Overseas sexual encounters between Norwegian royals and foreign women was evidently not an uncommon occurrence at the time. Certainly, the thirteenth-century Chronica of Roger de Hoveden (died 1201/1202) pointedly remarks upon the low-status of the mothers of Norwegian monarchs.Jochens, JM (1987) p. 342; Stubbs (1870) p. 272; Riley (1853) p. 341. Such relationships offered young women an opportunity to produce a royal son, and thereby procure preferment for herself and her family.Magn√∫sd√≥ttir (2013) p. 97; Larrington (2009) pp. 512‚Äì513; Jochens, J (1995) p. 97; Jochens, JM (1987) pp. 335, 349. Whether the women concerned actually pursued such schemes themselves is uncertain, and it is possible that they were instead selected by the kings themselves or proffered by their own families.Jochens, JM (1987) pp. 335, 349. In any case, it is conceivable that Eysteinn and Bja√∞«´k enjoyed the support of influential relatives who backed their claims. Despite his apparent Gaelic background, however, there is no hint of Eysteinn's interest in his homeland after his arrival in Scandinavia.Power (2005) pp. 21‚Äì22. Eysteinn jointly ruled as king with his brothers until the end of his life. One episode that may have bearing on Eysteinn's Gaelic heritage is his raiding expedition along the eastern British coast in about 1151. At about this time, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r √ìl√°fsson (died 1187), son and heir of the reigning King of the Isles, visited Norway and rendered homage to Ingi. Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's Scandinavian stay coincided with that of Nicholas Breakspeare, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano (died 1159), an Englishman who became pope in 1154.Sayers, JE (2004). The latter was instrumental in the creation of the Norwegian Archdiocese of Ni√∞ar√≥ss,Power (2005) p. 25; Sayers, JE (2004). an eclessiastical jurisdiction that officially included the Diocese of the Isles in 1154.Power (2005) p. 25. Nicholas also apparently favoured Ingi as king over Eysteinn and Sigur√∞r munnr. Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's cooperation with Ingi, therefore, could have been undertaken in the context of avoiding having to deal with Eysteinn and his seemingly Irish or Hebridean kin. Eysteinn's grandmother Nineteenth-century depiction of Haraldr gilli undergoing an ordeal to prove his paternity.Storm (1899) p. 564. The story of how Eysteinn's father came to the kingship is similar to that of Eysteinn. At some point in the 1120s, Haraldr gilli arrived in Norway claiming to be a brother of the reigning king.Antonsson (2007) p. 164; Jochens, JM (1987) pp. 341, 342‚Äì343 n. 61. The tale of Haraldr gilli's accession is preserved in several sources. According to Magn√∫ssona saga, within Heimskringla, a Norwegian baron named Hallkell h√∫kr voyaged from Norway to the Isles where he encountered Haraldr gilli and his mother. Named Gillikristr by the saga, Haraldr gilli told Hallkell h√∫kr that he was a son Magn√∫s berf√¶ttr, King of Norway (died 1103), and that another name of his was Haraldr.Finlay; Faulkes (2015) p. 162‚Äì163 ch. 26; Hollander (2011) p. 707 ch. 26; Aalto (2010) p. 95; Salvucci (2005) p. 124; Jochens, J (1995) pp. 96‚Äì97; Jochens, JM (1987) pp. 342‚Äì343 n. 61; Sellar (1966) p. 129; Anderson (1922) pp. 171‚Äì172; J√≥nsson (1911) pp. 547‚Äì548 ch. 26; Storm (1899) pp. 562‚Äì563 ch. 26; Unger (1868) pp. 691‚Äì692 ch. 34/33; Laing (1844) pp. 191‚Äì193 ch. 33. In fact, Haraldr gilli's byname‚Äîgilli‚Äîis a shortened form of Gillikristr, an Old Norse form of the Gaelic personal name Gilla Cr√≠st.Thornton (1997) p. 82. According to Magn√∫ssona saga, Haraldr gilli was originally from Ireland, and both he and his mother were subsequently conveyed to Norway by Hallkell h√∫kr, who presented them to Magn√∫s' reigning son, Sigur√∞r J√≥rsalafari, King of Norway (died 1130). FagrskinnaAalto (2010) p. 95; Finlay (2004) pp. 257‚Äì258 ch. 93; Anderson (1922) pp. 172‚Äì173 n. 2; J√≥nsson (1903) p. 334 ch. 78. and Morkinskinna give similar accounts, with the latter source calling him Haraldr Gillikristr.Andersson; Gade (2012) p. 352 ch. 76; Aalto (2010) p. 95; Power (2005) p. 18; Finlay (2004) p. 257 n. 759; J√≥nsson (1932) p. 391 ch. 6; Anderson (1922) pp. 172‚Äì173 n. 2; Unger (1867) p. 192. Some years before his arrival, whilst only a teenager, the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga indicates that Haraldr gilli encountered Kali Kolsson (died 1158) at Grimsby, where he revealed to Kali his parentage, as a descendant of Magn√∫s and an Isleswoman.Parker (2012) p. 186; Jochens, J (1995) pp. 96‚Äì97; Jochens, JM (1987) p. 342 n. 60; Vigfusson (1887) p. 95 ch. 62; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 75‚Äì76 ch. 50. According to Magn√∫ssona saga,Finlay; Faulkes (2015) p. 162‚Äì163 ch. 26; Hollander (2011) pp. 707‚Äì708 ch. 26; Jochens, JM (1987) pp. 341, 342‚Äì343 n. 61; Sellar (1966) p. 129; Anderson (1922) pp. 171‚Äì172, 172‚Äì173 n. 2; J√≥nsson (1911) pp. 547‚Äì548 ch. 26; Storm (1899) pp. 562‚Äì563 ch. 26; Unger (1868) pp. 691‚Äì692 ch. 34/33; Laing (1844) pp. 191‚Äì193 ch. 33. and the twelfth-century Historia de antiquitate regum Norwagiensium, after Haraldr gilli's arrival in Norway from Ireland or Scotia respectively, Sigur√∞r J√≥rsalafari had Haraldr gilli undergo an ordeal in which the latter was to walk upon nine red-hot ploughshares. The latter source further states that it was believed that Haraldr gilli was divinely aided since he emerged from his ordeal unburnt.McDougall; McDougall (2006) pp. 53 ch. 34, 114 n. 324; Finlay (2004) p. 257 n. 759; Sellar (1966) p. 129; Anderson (1922) pp. 172‚Äì173 n. 2. Since Haraldr gilli's mother evidently travelled with him to Norway, and Sigur√∞r J√≥rsalafari is known to have spent time in Ireland as a child, it is possible that Sigur√∞r J√≥rsalafari recognised her as a former lover of his father.Power (2005) p. 18. The accounts of Eysteinn's father gaining royal recognition illustrate that, although such claimants sometimes had to undergo ordeals to prove their paternity, the testimony of their foreign mothers also carried weight in the final decision.Jochens, J (1995) pp. 96‚Äì97. Nevertheless, not only did claimants to throne need to prove their paternity, they needed to also gain the acceptance of an assembled √æing in a process known as konungstekja.Jochens, J (1995) p. 95. Having gaining approval of such an assembly, a successful claimant would have sworn an oath to uphold the national law, whereupon he would have received an oath of allegiance from the assembly itself.Orning; Crozier (2008) p. 73. Eysteinn and Haraldr gilli lived during a remarkable period of Norwegian history in which civil warring waged for nearly a century, from 1130 to 1240. No less than forty-six candidates emerged seeking recognition as king during this period. Although twenty-four of these candidates succeeded, only two gained royal authority throughout the realm. In fact, only one king from this period, Ingi, was the legitimate son of a king. Later tradition The names of Bja√∞«´k and Eysteinn as they appear on folio 56v of AM 47 fol (Eirspennill): \\"\\".J√≥nsson (1916) p. 195; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). According to a much later tradition, dated to turn of the twentieth century and perhaps as early as the late eighteenth century, the grandfather of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles (died 1164), Gilla Adamn√°in, had a daughter who married a Norwegian king‚Äîa king who seemingly corresponds to Haraldr gilli himself.McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 5; Sellar (1966) p. 130; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) p. 36; MacDonald; MacDonald (1904) p. 178; Johnstone (1786) p. 152. Although there is no way to confirm the claim itself, such a union is not implausible, and may correspond to the relationship between Bja√∞«´k and Haraldr gilli.Power (2005) p. 21 n. 20; Sellar (1966) pp. 129‚Äì130. Certainly, Somairle himself had a daughter named Beth√≥c.Power (2005) p. 21; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 5; Sellar (1966) pp. 129‚Äì130. Nevertheless, the notion of an affiliation with Somairle's family postdates the printing of Heimskringla, which could suggest that this source spawned ideas of a familial connection.Power (2005) p. 21 n. 20.

It had also been known as the church of San Michele degli Scalzi in Orticaia, referring to the swampy nature of the site at the time of its founding. The term Scalzi refers to the barefoot monks linked to the church. Dating back to the 11th century, it has been restored several times in the original Romanesque style. History An oratory chapel was known at the site by 1025. A church was later built at the site and was assigned to an adjacent convent of Benedictines that was established in 1178 by monks from the abbey of Santa Maria di Pulsano sul Gargano. The first restoration of the site was completed by 1204. In the 15th century the church belonged successively to several religious orders, and before 1463 it came under the Canons Regular of the Lateran. Major modifications included the elaborate coffered ceiling (1596). The church was transferred to the Olivetan Order in 1774. Further internal decorations were added. Nineteenth-century reconstructions aimed to restore the original Romanesque features. Bombardments during the second world war, and floods, damaged the structure, requiring major rebuilding. Today The basilica structure of three naves is still preserved, ending with a semicircular apse. The incomplete fa√ßade has marble only in the lower layers. There are three portals. The central lunette has a copy of their original Byzantine decoration from 1203-1204 depicting a Christ providing Benediction (the original is in the National Museum of San Matteo, Pisa). The frieze is decorated with a relief of the angelic hierarchy in Byzantine style. The interior hosts a 13th- century crucifix, painted in tempera and gilded; this artwork was originally in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano, also in Pisa. The left site of the nave has a fresco of St Onofrius, Helen and a bishop. The altar dates from the 18th century. The organ was constructed by Anselmi-Tamburini and was brought here from the anterior parish church of San Michele in 1985. The former monastery, completely renovated, now serves as the cultural centre for the parish.

Taxonomy This species first appeared before modern science in the herbarium of Karl Maximovich, in which he labelled the specimen as Rheum megalacarpum. One of the first Europeans to write about this species was the General Nikolai Ivanovich Korolkov, who was engaged in the conquering of Turkestan, and collected herbarium specimens of this plant there in the early 1870s. Another early collector was Johann Albert von Regel, who collected specimens of this species less than a decade later in the highlands throughout the region (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan). He called the plant R. ribes. Boris Fedtschenko later published R. megalacarpum in his 1915 work –†–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –¢—É—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞, the Flora of Turkestan, but omitted a valid description. Agnia Losina-Losinskaja validly published the taxon in 1932 (the date in the publication itself is 1931) under its present name in the –ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è –ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–∞–¥–∞ –°.–°.–°.–†., also known as Bulletin du jardin botanique principal de l'U.R.S.S.. Description It has a single, reddish, leafless, branched stem 40‚Äì100 cm tall, the base of which is compressed to (only) one side and is sulcate and is covered in minute warts or smooth. The lateral branches open to less than 45¬∞ to form a pyramidal-shaped inflorescence. The leaves are round, 50 cm long and 60 cm wide, and have a reniform base. The margin is slightly wavy and fringed in tiny needles. Each leaf has three extremely prominent veins which are lateral at the base and only fork towards the margin. The top of the leaf is smooth; the underside is warty along the veins. The petiole is short, shorter than half of the leaf blade, the top being warty, rarely glabrous (smooth). The flowers are congregated and have a long peduncle which is jointed at the base. The greenish tepals are subequal, around 3mm long and 1mm wide. The stamens are very long. The large, oval fruit are 20mm long and 15mm wide, and have lateral, cordate wings -dark reddish-black when ripe, red when immature, with a vein running near the edge. The tepals hug the fruit. The seed is ovoid, wrinkled and brown. =Similar species= In her original 1932 description, as well as in her 1936 key in Komarov's Flora SSSR, Losinskaja considers this species closely related and most similar to Rheum ribes, the desert rhubarb of the mountains of the Middle East, in leaves and flowers, classifying them both in the section Ribesiformia. It can be distinguished from this species by its much smoother stem, much shorter leaf petiole and pyramidal-shaped inflorescence. =Hybrids= The natural hybrid Rheum √ó svetlanae from Central Asia is a hybrid of this species and R. compactum. Distribution It is primarily found in the Pamir, Altai and Western Tian-Shan mountains. It is found in Kazakhstan, eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and northeastern Afghanistan. Habitat It grows in the Chimgan mountains in Uzbekistan, Chatkalsky Gorge in an offshoot of the Western Tian-Shan near Tashkent, the Chatkal Range straddling Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as the Zarafshan Range straddling Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. It also has been found growing in the Hissar Range and in the land around the Vakhsh River in Tajikistan. In Kyrgyzstan it grows in the Chuy region and Taldy-Bulak valley in the Talas Alatau, Talas Region. In Kazakhstan it is found growing in the Kaskasu Gorge in the Karzhantau range, Korday Pass, the Kuyuk Pass near Taraz, in a number of places in the Aksu-Zhabagly Nature Reserve, on the Zhetysu ridge in the Ala-tau, and in the Karatau Mountains. Ecology =Life cycle= It flowers in Kazakhstan from May to June. =Habitat & plant associations= It has been collected growing from approximately 1700 to 3200m in elevation in the Western Tian-Shan, from in the 1300 to 2000m in the Chatkalsky, from 2300 to 2600m in the Zarafshan Range, 1780m in the Hissar, and 3300 to 3700m in the Vakhsh region. In southwestern Gorno-Badakhshan it usually grows in a type of ecosystem called taran in the local Tajik, although it is not always present. This ecosystem is somewhat uncommon, but may occur at a variety of elevations on alluvial fans near snow accumulations, and is characterised by being dominated by large herbaceous Polygonum coriarium. Other plant species which usually may share this taran habitat are Prangos pabularia, Ferula jaeschkeana, F. grigoriewii, Heracleum olgae, Ephedra tibetica, E. ciliata, E. gerardiana and Artemisia species. In the Shugnan area it grows on mildly sloping scree together with Prangos pabularia, Ferula grigoriewii, Heracleum lehmannianum, H. olgae, Polygonum coriarium, Ephedra spp. and Artemisia spp., with on the steeper slopes isolated plants of the climber Ampelopsis vitifolia, Perovskia scrophulariifolia, Onobrychis echidna, the wild chickpea Cicer songaricum and sometimes the cushion plant Acantholimon pamiricum. In the Kaskasu Gorge of Kazakhstan it grows in the foothills in grass and gravel, unlike the sympatric Rheum wittrockii which is found in more wooded settings. It grows at the altitude of 2200m in the Chuy region of Kyrgyzstan in pastures used for grazing milking mares together with plants such as Codonopsis clematidea, Cysticorydalis fedtschenkoana, Dactylorhiza umbrosa, Dictamnus angustifolius and Korolkowia sewerzowii. It shares its habitat in the hills around Korday Pass with Anemone petiolulosa and Iris kuschakewiczii, a bit lower down on flatter ground the common species are Leontice eversmanii, Gagea filiformis, Tulipa greigii and T. ostrowskiana, and hidden under shrub cover Corydalis ledebouriana and Eranthis longistipitata. Gagea ova is present, but rare here. Habitat =Animal interactions= The emerging leaves of this rhubarb are an important food source for the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos ssp. isabellinus) when it emerges from hibernation in April in the Taldy-Bulak valley in the Talas Alatau, Talas Region, Kyrgyzstan; their droppings looking just like stewed rhubarb. It grows here in between trees of Prunus mahaleb together with Pedicularis olgae and the large-flowered Anemone gortschakovii. The caterpillars of the blue butterfly Callophrys titanus, which is found from southern Kazakhstan to Tajikistan and was described in 1998, have only been found to feed on R. maximowiczii. These caterpillars are myrmecophilous and are attended by a coterie of protective ants of the genus Lasius. Uses In the country report submitted to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the Global Plan of Action for the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, part of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan identifies R. maximowiczii as an edible, but under-utilized, plant. Local names It is known as –º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á —Ä–∞—É“ì–∞—à—ã or –º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á —Ä–∞—É“ì–∞—à in Kazakh. In Russian it is known as —Ä–µ–≤–µ–Ω—å –º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á–∞. Chemistry Maximol A can be found in R. maximowiczii.Phenylbutanoids and stilbene derivatives of Rheum maximowiczii.

Harrison began writing the song with Gary Wright on New Year's Day 1978 and finished the lyrics a month later while in Hawaii. The song appears as the final track on George Harrison. Its lyrics are a statement on the power of faith to bring about a desired outcome. Harrison recorded \\"If You Believe\\" in 1978 at his home studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire. The track includes a synthesizer contribution from Wright and was co-produced by Harrison and Russ Titelman. The musical arrangement also features multiple acoustic guitars, a heavy drum sound and orchestral strings, and so recalls Harrison's early 1970s recordings with Phil Spector. The song was considered for release as a single after \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" but the release did not take place. Background After completing promotion for his first album on his Dark Horse record label, Thirty Three & 1/3, in April 1977, George Harrison spent the remainder of the year following the Formula 1 world championship itinerary and having little involvement with the music industry.Huntley, pp. 153‚Äì54.Woffinden, p. 104. He later described this as \\"skiving [off]\\"Snow, p. 64. after a period of difficulty regarding Dark Horse's distribution, which changed from A&M; Records to Warner Bros. in November 1976,Madinger & Easter, p. 454.Woffinden, p. 103. and problems he had encountered since 1975 with some of the artists signed to the label.Snow, p. 58. Having returned to songwriting late in 1977, refreshed from the recent diversion,Huntley, pp. 156, 161.Rodriguez, p. 365. Harrison began writing \\"If You Believe\\" with his friend Gary Wright on New Year's Day 1978.Madinger & Easter, p. 458. The writing session took place at Friar Park, Harrison's home in Henley, Oxfordshire.Harry, p. 236. The song was the first official collaboration between Harrison and Wright.Leng, p. 209.Inglis, p. 71. For Wright, the period from late 1977 was one of self-doubt due to the commercial failure of his album Touch and Gone, which continued the downward trend of his career following his long-sought-after breakthrough with The Dream Weaver over 1975‚Äì76.Wright, pp. 170‚Äì71. The song addresses the importance of self- beliefAllison, p. 146. and the knowledge that this quality is conducive to avoiding misfortune. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison recalls that the collaboration was initiated by Wright offering a segment, which the two of them then developed into a song.Harrison, p. 358. Harrison wrote the lyrics to the verses in Hawaii, where he holidayed with his wife, Olivia Arias, in February 1978, and enjoyed an intensive period of writing for his next album, George Harrison.Madinger & Easter, pp. 457, 458.Badman, p. 219. Composition \\"If You Believe\\" is a pop-rock song in 4/4 time and set to a heavy rock beat. The key throughout is C major. The structure of the composition is an instrumental passage followed by a verse and a chorus, followed by a second round of the same three sections,Harrison, p. 357. with repeated choruses to close the song. The verses comprise two rounds of six-bar passages, with a chord pattern of C, C7, F, F minor, G and G7. The choruses use the first five of these chords but extend the phrasing on C and F and introduce a half-bar (over which the C7 chord is played), so that each of the two rounds lasts for six-and-a-half bars.\\"If You Believe\\", in George Harrison George Harrison: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Warner Bros. Music (New York, NY, 1979). Author Simon Leng comments that the adoption of a three- word title recalls Harrison's early 1970s hits \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Give Me Love\\", and that, with \\"If You Believe\\", he and Wright add a \\"gospel-infused hook\\" to that formula. In the lyrics, Harrison espouses the idea that all things are possible and, in author Ian Inglis' description, that \\"The secret is simply to have faith and believe, in oneself and in others.\\" In the first verse, he sings of the choice between \\"worry[ing] your life away\\" and embracing transcendence by \\"Wak[ing] up to the love that flows on around you\\".Allison, pp. 11‚Äì12, 128. Theologian Dale Allison views the song as an example of Harrison blending Christian and Hindu teachings. He cites the chorus' reference to belief in first \\"you\\" and then \\"me\\" (with the latter term referring to God) as an exhortation to recognise that \\"the kingdom of God is within\\", since \\"the listeners' belief in themselves ('you') is correlated with their belief in God ('me').\\" Allison views the line \\"Get up, you have all your needs ‚Äì pray\\" as similarly reflecting a Hindu message, whereby the individual possesses \\"divine attributes\\" that can be realised.Allison, pp. 120‚Äì21. By contrast, he identifies the line \\"Everything you thought is possible if you believe\\" as a likely biblical quotation, from the New Testament gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.Allison, pp. 57, 146. Recording Recording for the George Harrison album began at Harrison's studio, FPSHOT, in March 1978, with Russ Titelman co-producing the sessions.Madinger & Easter, p. 457.Leng, pp. 199, 201. As inspiration for his album in two years,Leng, p. 205. Harrison made a point of listening to his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass.Badman, p. 221.Huntley, p. 162. Wright arrived in England in mid May on his return from a six-week holiday in India and took part in the recording of \\"If You Believe\\".Wright, p. 179. His contribution included the horn parts, which he played on an Oberheim synthesizer. Wright thereby became the only musician other than Harrison to appear on all of his post-Beatles solo albums up to that point, beginning with All Things Must Pass.Harry, p. 395. The orchestral strings on the song were arranged by Del Newman and overdubbed at AIR Studios in London.Madinger & Easter, pp. 457, 458.Harry, p. 188. The 1978 sessions marked the first time that Harrison had shared the producer's role on one of his albums since working with Phil Spector in the early 1970s.Woffinden, p. 106. Leng considers that on \\"If You Believe\\", the horn sounds, Harrison's slide guitar riffs and the orchestral strings contribute to the song's retrogressive quality, by mirroring the sound Harrison had first achieved with Spector in 1970. Leng identifies Hall & Oates' \\"The Last Time\\" ‚Äì which was a homage to Spector's 1960s productions,Paul Pearson, \\"Celebrate the Catalog: Hall & Oates\\" > \\"Part Two: Bigger Than Both of Us\\", Treble, 5 May 2014 (retrieved 1 August 2017). and featured a slide guitar part by Harrison ‚Äì as the trigger for his return to the All Things Must Pass sound. Leng highlights the syncopated rhythm section in the opening verse of \\"If You Believe\\" as especially reminiscent of \\"The Last Time\\", which was itself derivative of \\"Leader of the Pack\\" by the Shangri-Las. Release George Harrison was released on Dark Horse Records on 20 February 1979.Madinger & Easter, p. 635. \\"If You Believe\\" was sequenced as the final track on the album, after \\"Soft Touch\\".Inglis, p. 150. Coinciding with the release, Harrison and Arias attended the Brazilian Grand PrixBadman, p. 229.Clayson, p. 366. in S√£o Paulo,Harry, p. 82. and were joined there by Wright and his wife, who were travelling in South America at the time.Wright, pp. 191‚Äì92. The song was published by Harrison's companies Oops and Ganga (subsequently combined as Umlaut Corporation) and Warner Bros. Music.Harrison, p. 384. Harrison did minimal promotion for the album,Clayson, p. 369.Rodriguez, p. 175. which lessened its commercial impact in Britain. In an interview with Mick Brown, for Rolling Stone, Harrison said he was pleased with all the songs but identified \\"If You Believe\\" and \\"Soft Touch\\" as the ones he was least impressed by. In the case of \\"If You Believe\\", Harrison added: \\"I like the sentiment of that, but it's a bit obvious as a tune ‚Ä¶\\" With \\"Blow Away\\" and \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" earmarked as singles from the album, \\"If You Believe\\" was also considered but the release did not take place. Critical reception George Harrison received favourable reviews from the majority of music critics,Huntley, p. 169. many of whom remarked on Harrison's obvious contentment with life.Rodriguez, p. 392.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188. Billboard magazine's reviewer wrote that the album continued in the optimistic tone Harrison had established with Thirty Three & 1/3, and included \\"If You Believe\\" among its \\"best cuts\\".Ed Harrison (reviews ed.), \\"Billboard's Top Album Picks\\", Billboard, 24 February 1979, p. 80 (retrieved 3 August 2017). Writing in Melody Maker, E.J. Thribb said that Harrison offered \\"an answer to all the world's problems (or some of them) with 'If You Believe'\\". He quoted the opening verse and concluded: \\"Actually, I'd subscribe to that theory.\\" Peoples reviewer recognised the song as typifying the album's \\"lyrically cheery and thematically uplifting\\" qualities but also its prevalence of unremarkable arrangements, saying that the performance on the track was \\"reminiscent of the Big Sound (slide guitar, horns et al) Harrison achieved on his epic All Things Must Pass\\". The reviewer added that \\"new Harrison fans\\" would be better served by searching out the 1970 triple album rather than buying the new release. Harry George of the NME said that Harrison's love for Arias had seemingly replaced his devotion to Krishna and had reinvigorated his music. George identified \\"If You Believe\\" as one of the few tracks on which the backing musicians were \\"breaking sweat\\" amid the predominantly calm mood, although he viewed it and \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" as \\"solid medium-pacers, neither thrilling nor negligible\\".Harry George, \\"George Harrison George Harrison (Dark Horse)\\", NME, 24 February 1979, p. 22. Writing for Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson cited the New Year's Day writing session as the start of a prolific period for Harrison and recognised his revisiting All Things Must Pass for inspiration as equally important for the 1979 album's success.Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 18. PopMatters' Jason Korenkiewicz welcomed the 2004 reissue of George Harrison, and described the song as a \\"brief but joyous country spiritual\\" that was among the three standout tracks, along with \\"Blow Away\\" and \\"Here Comes the Moon\\".Jason Korenkiewicz, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse Years 1976‚Äì1992\\", PopMatters, 2 May 2004 (retrieved 24 July 2016). Former Mojo editor Mat Snow praises the same three songs as the best of Harrison's \\"romantic and reflective\\" songwriting on the album and says that this quality was complemented by Titelman's \\"tastefully contemporary\\" sound.Snow, p. 68. In another 2004 review, John Metzger of The Music Box highlighted Wright's appearance among reasons why the two-year gap between Harrison albums was \\"well worth [the wait]\\". Metzger said that \\"Each track on George Harrison was a folk-pop gem that felt like a lost Beatles tune\\" and added that, although the production was sometimes overly polished, \\"the slicker textures weren't enough to sink the often airy and uplifting arrangements.\\"John Metzger, \\"George Harrison The Dark Horse Years (Part Two: George Harrison)\\", The Music Box, vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 14 August 2014). Among Harrison and Beatles biographers, Robert Rodriguez views \\"If You Believe\\" as a worthy choice for a single after the similarly commercial \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\", and describes it as \\"nearly as engaging\\" as the US hit \\"Blow Away\\".Rodriguez, pp. 175‚Äì76. Ian Inglis writes that the song \\"lacks the innovative qualities of 'Within You Without You,' the melodic impact of 'My Sweet Lord,' and the lyrical complexity of 'Living in the Material World'\\", and he views it as \\"a perfectly pleasant but ultimately unremarkable track\\". Simon Leng comments that, whereas the sound on George Harrison generally signals both a maturation of and a departure from the artist's previous work, the song appears formulaic and derivative.Leng, pp. 200‚Äì01, 209. He says that it \\"sounds like it was conceived to be a hit single\\" yet \\"doesn't completely convince\\".

","title":"If You Believe (George Harrison song)"},{"id":"34610548","text":"Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly is an Indian jurist. He served as the Chairman of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and as a Judge of the Supreme Court of India who delivered judgement in some high-profile cases like the 2G spectrum case.  Early life and education  Justice Ganguly was born on 3 February 1947. He graduated in M.A (English) from University of Calcutta in 1968 and then passed LLB from the same university in 1970.  Career  He started his career in 1969 by teaching in the same school, Khidderpore Academy of which he was once a student. In 1972, he started practice in Calcutta High Court. On 10 January 1994, he was appointed a permanent judge of Calcutta High Court but within 3 months was transferred to Patna High Court. After remaining in Patna High Court for more than 6 years, he was transferred back to Calcutta High Court on 1 August 2000. There he subsequently became senior most puisne Judge in March 2005. He functioned twice as \\"Acting Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court\\". Later he was transferred to Orissa High Court where he joined as the senior most puisne Judge on 21 April 2006. On 2 March 2007 he took oath as Chief Justice of Orissa. He joined Madras High Court as Chief Justice on 19 May 2008. Later he was transferred to Supreme Court of India where he joined on 17 December 2008 and remained in the apex court for more than 3 years. He retired on 3 February 2012. Post his retirement, justice Ganguly worked as guest faculty at National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata. He also went on to be the Chairperson of the West Bengal Human Rights commission, where his role was highly appreciated. Notable judgements  * 2G spectrum case ‚Äì On 2 February 2012 the bench of Justice AK Ganguly & Justice GS Singhvi quashed 122 2G licenses issued in the year 2008 by A. Raja, then \\"Union Telecom Minister\\". * The Emergency (India) ‚Äì In a judgement, Justice AK Ganguly observed that in 1975 during the emergency period of India, Supreme Court of India had violated the fundamental rights of the Indian citizens. In the ADM Jabalpur vs Shivakant Shukla case (1976). A bench of Justices Aftab Alam and Ganguly took the view that the majority decision of a five-member Constitution Bench upholding the suspension of fundamental rights during \\"Emergency\\" was erroneous. * President's power of pardon ‚Äì The President of India can grant a pardon to or reduce the sentence of a convicted person for one time, particularly in cases involving punishment of death but in a judgement delivered by Justice Ganguly said that the president or the governor exercising the power of pardon in granting remission of sentence to a convict could not encroach into the judicial domain and give a finding on the guilt of the convict. If such a power was exercised arbitrarily, mala fide or in absolute disregard of the finer canons of the constitutionalism, the by- product order could not get the approval of law and in such cases, the judicial hand must be stretched to it. * Imposed Rs. 1 million fine on Maharashtra state govt. ‚Äì In a judgement delivered on 14 December 2010 by Justice Ganguly, as a Supreme Court Judge, he imposed Rs. 1 million fine on Maharashtra state govt. on a complaint that the then chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh influenced police against registering an FIR against MLA Dilip Kumar Sananda. The court said that \\"The (former) chief minister should not have interfered with the criminal justice system.\\" Observing that the message conveyed in this case is \\"extremely shocking\\", the court directed that the fine amount collected should be used for the welfare of the distressed farmers. It was alleged that then Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's personal secretary Amba Das had called up the then district superintendent of police (SP) to inform that the chief minister did not want any FIR to be registered in the case. Accordingly, the SP asked his subordinates not to register any FIR but reportedly recorded the same in its file. Aggrieved by the refusal of the police to register an FIR, the victims approached the Bombay High Court which, apart from ordering registration of an FIR, also imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the state. But the state govt challenged Bombay High Court's verdict in Supreme Court of India. * In a judgement on 6 July 2011, the bench of Justice Ganguly along with Justice GS Singhvi ordered that entire 156 hectares of land be given back to the robbed farmers. The government had acquired the land for \\"development\\" but was handed over to builders for making commercial and residential complexes. The bench imposed a fine of Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) for its illegal act.  Controversies  A woman intern had alleged a recently retired Supreme Court judge had sexually harassed her. The Supreme Court, then appointed a three-member committee to probe the allegations and identified A K Ganguly was the one who harassed her. He repeatedly denied all charges. He was indicted on 6 December 2013 by the committee, which agreed with the intern's allegation that he had subjected her to \\"unwelcome sexual behaviour\\" in December 2012. He resigned from the West Bengal Human Rights Commission on 6 January 2014 after the Union Cabinet decided to make a Presidential Reference on 2 January 2014 to the Supreme Court for his removal. He was acquitted of all charges after the intern refused to record her statement before the police.

It is a defunct railway transit point on the Bangladesh-India border. History By the turn of the nineteenth century Lalmonirhat railway station had emerged as an important railway centre. Bengal Dooars Railway constructed a line to Malbazar. Cooch Behar State Railway constructed the Geetaldaha-Jayanti narrow gauge line. Links were established with Assam, with the Golokganj-Amingaon line coming up. In pre-independence days, a metre gauge line running via Radhikapur, Biral, Parbatipur, Tista, Gitaldaha and Golokganj connected Fakiragram in Assam with Katihar in Bihar. The Mogalhat-Geetaldaha link was there in 1955, when Pakistan and India signed an agreement regarding resumption of rail traffic. Subsequently, a part of the bridge across the Dharla River at was washed away transforming Mogalhat- Geetaldaha, a defunct railway transit point. Note: The map alongside presents the position as it stands today (2020). The international border was not there when the railways were first laid in the area in the 19th-20th century.

In addition to his judicial duties he was a trusted political adviser to both Elizabeth I and James I. He sat in the English House of Commons in the short-lived Addled Parliament of 1614.Thrush, Andrew editor The History of Parliament- the House of Commons 1604-1629 Early career Hartest, present day He was the son of William Gardiner, a substantial yeoman farmer who held lands at Hartest and Shimpling in Suffolk, and his wife Alice, widow of a Mr Ling. Born in 1540, he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1562 and was reader of the Inn in 1585. He was called to the Bar in 1570.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.222 Irish career Queen Elizabeth, who despite their occasional quarrels, had great trust in Gardiner, sent him to Ireland as Lord Chief Justice in 1586 with exceptional powers to review the operation of the Courts of Common Law. CrawfordCrawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571-1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2006 p.249 states that he had \\"a mandate to reform both courts and administration\\", but it does not seem that he had much success in this mission. His appointment was strongly endorsed by Sir Christopher Wray, his counterpart as English Lord Chief Justice.Thrush History of Parliament Irish politics at the time was dominated by the feud between the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot, and his opponents, who were led by Adam Loftus, the Archbishop of Dublin. Gardiner took Loftus' side and worked for Perrot's recall.Crawford p.104 He was appointed one of the judicial commissioners to deal with the aftermath of the Desmond Rebellion in 1588: its proceedings caused a good deal of criticism on the grounds of bias as virtually all claims were decided in the Crown's favour. He negotiated with Hugh O'Neill in 1594 and 1596, leading to a serious quarrel with the Queen and his temporary disgrace. He served as Lord Justice of Ireland in 1597. He fought against Hugh O'Neill in 1598 and against the Spanish Army at Kinsale in 1601-2.Ball, p.222 The Queen and Gardiner quarreled in 1596/7, apparently over the humiliating peace terms which he agreed with the rebel Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, which in the Queen's view amounted to a virtual abdication of English rule in Ireland, and he was in temporary disgrace as a result.Thrush History of Parliament Nonetheless she retained great confidence in Gardiner, and knighted him in 1591. He seems to have been considered irreplaceable by each successive Lord Deputy of Ireland, who ignored his constant pleas, from early in his career in Ireland, to be allowed to retire on health grounds. Like some (though by no means all) English settlers in Ireland he disliked the damp Irish climate and believed that it was damaging his health. In addition his judicial duties were so heavy- for a time he was effectively in charge of three of the four Irish High Courts- that in 1592 Sir William FitzWilliam, the Lord Deputy, while refusing to allow him to retire, voiced concerns about the burden he was carrying.Thrush History of Parliament In 1603 he was finally permitted to retire.Ball, p.222 Later years His public career was by no means over, since the new King James I found him as dependable a royal servant as Queen Elizabeth had. He was entrusted with the reform the governments of Jersey and Guernsey in 1604-5, and was at Court advising on Irish affairs in 1607 and again in 1613-14; he was prominent in local government in as late as 1609.Ball, p.222 In 1614, rather unexpectedly given his advanced age, he entered the House of Commons as member for Suffolk. He was diligent in attendance, and spoke several times, but the so-called Addled Parliament was completely ineffective and was dissolved after only two months.Thrush History of Parliament In his last years he founded almshouses at Elmswell, where he was lord of the manor, for the care of six poor women, three from Elmswell and three from nearby Woolpit, where he also held the manor. The charity still exists. Through his marriage into the Spring family he held for his lifetime the manor of Pakenham, Suffolk.Ball, p.222 He died in 1620 and was buried at Elmswell; a memorial was erected to him in the parish church.Kelly's Directory 1916 St Mary's Church, Woolpit. Gardiner was Lord of the Manor here. Family He married firstly Anne Cordell (died 1587), daughter of Robert Cordell, a brewer, a cousin of the prominent judge and politician Sir William Cordell. He married secondly Thomasine Barker, daughter of John Barker of Ipswich, and thirdly Mary (or Anne) Trelawney, daughter of John Trelawney of Menheniot, Cornwall and Anne Reskymer, and widow of John Spring of Lavenham. His three children all died young; most of his estate passed to a grandnephew, Gardiner Webb, and the residue to his sister Mary Snow.Ball, p.222 Through his third marriage he was the stepfather of the politician Sir William Spring. Robert seems to have treated William very much as though he were his own son, and raised him in his own strong Puritan beliefs.Thrush History of Parliament Character Francis Bacon thought highly of Gardiner, urging one of his successors as Lord Chief Justice to follow the example of his \\"constancy and integrity\\".Ball, p.240 Bacon's high opinion of Gardiner was shared by many of his colleagues. Chief Justice Wray praised him as \\"wise, learned, discreet and courageous\\". Sir Henry Wallop called him the most constant man who was ever sent from England to govern Ireland. Lord Deputy FitzWilliam said that he was so \\"wise, temperate and useful\\" that his services could not easily be spared.Thrush History of Parliament In an age when a good deal of official corruption was tolerated, Gardiner had a reputation for honesty. He himself maintained that he had no interest in lining his pockets. However he certainly profited from his office to some extent, as he was able to purchase the manors of Elmswell and Woolpit, as well as lands in Norfolk.Thrush History of Parliament References Category:People from Babergh Category:1540 births Category:1620 deaths Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Lords Chief Justice of Ireland ","title":"Robert Gardiner (Chief Justice)"},{"id":"34610757","text":"Audit Bureau of Jordan is an independent Government agency and a supreme audit institution which is responsible for auditing the ministries, public institutions, public departments, municipalities, co-operatives, labor unions, corporations where Government of Jordan has more than 50% of their shares, and any entity the Council of Ministers may entrust the Bureau to audit its accounts.

Early genetics studies were published from 2001, ‚Äì see also the erratum. through to recently, but a revision based on them has yet to be. In 2001 Karsten Meyer proposed a revision in which the species Melastoma affine and other species were subsumed within this species M. malabathricum. In Australia, currently most authorities do not accept this; instead the naturally occurring populations in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland and north eastern New South Wales remain recognised as M. affine, except by authorities in Queensland. Australian populations which occur as weeds, having different flowers, for example in Warraroon Reserve, Lane Cove, Sydney, further south than the natural distribution of M. affine, are introduced plants of this M. malabathricum species. Description M. malabathricum grows wild on a wide range of soils, from sea-level up to an altitude of 3000 meters. It is an erect, free-flowering shrub that grows to a height of about 3 meters. The plant is branched, and has reddish stems that are covered with bristly scales and minute hairs. Its leaves are simple, elliptic lanceolate with a rounded base, are up to 7 cm long, have three distinct main veins running from base to apex. Its flowers are borne on short terminal cymes 2 to 8 cm across. Its fruit is a berry, which when ripe breaks irregularly to expose its soft, dark blue pulp and orange seeds.

Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A - C. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003, p. 426. is an Amharic-language novel, published in 1983. It was written by Baalu Girma. The novel presents a cynical account on the Red Star Campaign of the Derg military junta. The book was published by the Kuraz Publishing Agency in Addis Ababa.Iyob, Ruth. The Eritrean Struggle for Independence: Domination, Resistance, Nationalism, 1941-1993. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 175. In spite of a government ban on the book, it became widely read and famous.Universit√§t Hamburg. Aethiopica: international journal of Ethiopian studies. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 1998, p. 241. According to Ruth Iyob, the book presents \\"an accurate and compelling account of the events surrounding the failure of this campaign\\". The Red Star Campaign had been declared by Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam in a speech in Asmara on January 25, 1982. In his speech Mengistu called for the crushing of \\"secessionist bandits\\", i.e. the EPLF guerrilla in Eritrea, the TPLF in Tigray and the EPRP and EDU in Gondar. The campaign was supposed to focus both on military means as well as supporting reconstruction in the affected areas. The Commission for Organizing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia was assigned the task of leading the campaign. The government sent some 120,000 troops to participate in the campaign, making it the largest military offensive of the Derg in the Eritrean war.Shinn, David H., and Thomas P. Ofcansky. Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 341. The author Baalu Girma, had been invited by Mengistu to work as propaganda chief in the Red Terror Campaign. He had assumed the position believing in the goals of the campaign. However, he came to feel that the ideals of the campaign had been corrupted by militaristic mindsets. Once the campaign had been abruptly called off, Baalu Girma began writing Oromay based on the events of the campaign. While the official propaganda lauded the Red Star Campaign as a success, Baalu Girma considered it a failure. He stayed behind in Eritrea during this period.Abraham, Kinfe. Ethiopia, from Bullets to the Ballot Box: The Bumpy Road to Democracy and the Political Economy of Transition. Lawrenceville, NJ: Red Sea Press, 1994, pp. 113‚Äì114. Oromay is a love story set in Asmara in the midst of the conflict.Baalu Girma Foundation. Bookstore. Baalu Girma changed the names of real-life Derg officials.Michigan State University. Northeast African Studies. [East Lansing, MI]: African Studies Center, Michigan State University, 1995, pp. 139‚Äì140. Dawit Wolde Giorgis, then the head of COPWE in Asmara is depicted in the book as the character \\"Solomon Betre-Giorgis\\". Other real-life Derg officials depicted in the novel are Fisaha Geda (as Tedla Regassa, Chief of Protocol), Tesfaye Wolde-Selassie (as Betru Tesema) and Fasika Sidelel (as Mashafe Daniel). These were figures that Baalu Girma knew personally. According to Dawit Woldis-Giorgis it was obvious whom the fictional characters depicted. The Derg government is illustrated as corrupt and inefficient in the novel. However, the bulk of the book is dedicated to accounts of the war in Eritrea.Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden. African studies abstracts: the abstracts journal of the African Studies Centre, Leiden, Volume 27. East Grinstead, West Sussex, UK: Hans Zell, 1996, p. 42. In Oromay accounts of massacres and rapes committed by government militias in Eritrean villages are presented, as a consequence of the discourse equating all Eritreans with rebels.Adera, Taddesse. Silence Is Not Golden: A Critical Anthology of Ethiopian Literature. Lawrenceville, NJ: Red Sea Press, 1995, pp. 159‚Äì160. The book also deals with the real-world rumour that Tekle Gebre Mariam, an EPLF leader that had defected to the Derg, had been an EPLF double-agent.Pateman, Roy. Residual Uncertainty: Trying to Avoid Intelligence and Policy Mistakes in the Modern World. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 2003, pp. 79‚Äì80. During this period it was extremely rare that literature presenting any form of criticism (even in mild forms) of the government could get past the official censors.Article 19 (Organization), and American Library Association. Information Freedom and Censorship: World Report 1991 ; Article 19. Chicago: American Library Association, 1991, p. 16. According to Kinfe Abraham, the only reason Oromay could get published was a feud between Mengistu and Fikre Selassie. However, just 24 hours after its release the government banned the novel. All copies were removed from book shops. Confiscated copies of the book were turned into pulp at the Wenji sugar plant.Molvaer, Reidulf K. Black Lions: The Creative Lives of Modern Ethiopia's Literary Giants and Pioneers. Lawrenceville, NJ [u.a.]: Red Sea Press, 1997, p. 351. Possession of the Oromay became dangerous, as owners were subjected to government harassment. But some 500 copies had already been sold before the ban had been issued and the book continued to be copied through xerox machines. Baalu Girma was fired from his job. Some months later he \\"disappeared\\". It is generally believed that his disappearance was linked to the publishing of Oromay.  Plot  The story is narrated in the third person by a journalist named Tsegaye who is also the main character in story. He is sent to Asmara, Eritrea, as propaganda minister of the Red Star campaign, an effort to defeat the rising insurgency in the area by a combination of economic and military campaigns. He arrives in Asmara in the evening and goes out to tour the city and make a documentary to be aired that same day. During his tour, he notices the strain caused by the insurgency on the local population, which is suffering from lack of food and fuel. Nonetheless, he attempts to portray an image of a resilient society that stands for peace and unification. He goes to a reception where he meets Fiameta Gila and falls in love with her. He also meets Selay Berhe, who is a double agent with Shabia, and is the chief of a cell operating in Asmara going by the code name of Oromay. He has had previous experience with Fiameta, and is not happy when she approaches Tsegaye during the reception.

Life  He was the second-eldest son of Count Simon VI of Lippe and his wife Elizabeth of Schauenburg and Holstein. In 1601, Simon and his older brother Bernard travelled to Kassel, where they studied at the court school. After Bernard's untimely death in 1602, Simon returned to Brake, where his father introduced him systematically to the business of government. When his father died in 1613, he took up government. In 1617, he managed to end a bitter dispute his late father had had with the city of Lemgo. Simon VI had tried to enforce Calvinism throughout the county, but the citizens of Lemgo preferred Lutheranism. The Treaty of R√∂hrentrup allowed Lutheranism in Lemgo and gave the city the right of High justice, which the city then used to organize witch trials. Simon VII remained neutral during the Thirty Years' War, in an attempt to spare his small country as much as possible. The country suffered nevertheless, when foreign soldiers were billeted in the county.  Marriage and issue  Simon VII married Countess Anna Catherine of Nassau-Wiesbaden- Idstein (1590-1622) in 1607.

Colfer had previously alluded to the novel being the final entry when he stated that the previous book, The Atlantis Complex, was the penultimate in the series. The Last Guardian was released 10 July 2012 by Viking Press and Disney Hyperion. The novel received generally positive reviews, winning the award for the 2012 Senior Irish Children's Book of the Year.  Plot  Just as Artemis leaves his final session of therapy for Atlantis Complex, he and Butler are summoned by Holly to the office of Commander Trouble Kelp, where they witness the next plan of Opal Koboi; she has two of her underlings kill her past self, who had survived the Kraken blast in The Time Paradox. Her past self's death creates a paradox, causing Opal's creations from the past five years to violently explode. To prevent the destruction of Atlantis, Opal's prison, the Fairies place Opal in the containment chamber of a nuclear reactor. The blast destroys most Fairy technology, which Koboi labs had controlled or created, and human technology, since black market Koboi chips had been used in their development and construction. As explosions throughout the world blow out most vehicles, buildings, satellites, and cell phones, killing many people in the process, human communication systems shut down, and the human world falls into chaos. During her stay in the nuclear reactor, Opal furthers her ability to use black magic and opens The Berserker's Gate, a portal located on the Fowl estate, behind which dwell the spirits of fairy soldiers killed in the Battle of Taillte, an ancient war fought nearly ten thousand years previously. The spirits rise and possess Beckett and Myles, Artemis's twin brothers, Juliet, corpses, and woodland critters. Queen Bellico is the spirit possessing Juliet. When Artemis, Holly, and Butler arrive on the estate after a last-minute escape from Haven, they immediately try to foil Opal's plan, but they end up in hiding with Mulch Diggums, who was trying to rob Fowl Manor. After several more battles, Bellico permanently cripples Butler's heart with a bolt of Opal's black magic, and Mulch rides a rampaging troll to assist Artemis' plan to prevent Opal from opening the second gate with a laser cannon from a solar plane Artemis developed in a shed. Artemis and Holly release some of the spirits to heaven before Opal opens the second lock. Using Opal's dying clone, Nopal, which Opal had created in The Opal Deception, Artemis closes the second lock on the Berserker's Gate, since only Opal's genetic fingerprint can close the second lock forever. The possessed humans are released, but not before the group's leader, Oro Shaydova, uses Beckett's body to kill Opal once and for all. The closing of the second lock destroys all fairies within the boundaries, killing Artemis due to the fairy eye he received from Holly in The Lost Colony. Six months later, in a recovered human world, Foaly clones Artemis using DNA from Artemis' saliva from when he kissed Holly's forehead just before he began the final plan to stop Opal. Artemis's soul, which clung on through sheer willpower and intellect at the Fowl Estate, then inhabits the mindless clone. As a result of Artemis' resurrection, he has suffered heavy temporary memory loss. Holly begins to tell the clone the story of how she met the original Artemis, starting the opening line of the first book in the series: \\"It all started in Ho Chi Minh City one summer. It was sweltering by anyone's standards. Needless to say, Artemis Fowl would not have been willing to put up with such discomfort if something extremely important had not been at stake. Important to the plan...\\" Background Colfer stated that he wanted the novel to deal with Artemis' transformation \\"from being a selfish criminal to a hero who is prepared to sacrifice everything for a good cause.\\" Colfer had intended the series to be a trilogy but wrote more novels since the series spawned more ideas. He then \\"decided that I could only write a book about Artemis if the story was strong enough, so I planned one at a time. After eight, I concluded it was time to move on.\\"  Reception Critical reception for The Last Guardian was positive, meeting with praise from most reviewers. Kirkus Reviews praised the book, writing: \\"Colfer pits his resourceful crew against an army of killer bunnies and decomposed corpses (most of the estate's other residents being off for Christmas). All this is on the way to a smashing set of climactic twists and turns, just deserts and life-changing sacrifices.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the book a grade of \\"A‚àí\\" and wrote that \\"pseudo science, overly complex schemes, and the requisite dwarf flatulence jokes abound, but the heart of the series remains with Artemis and his evolution from spoiled but brilliant teenager to thoughtful, self-sacrificing, still brilliant young adult.\\" The Irish Times commented on the series' international popularity, attributing it to the series' \\"quick-moving and highly charged narratives\\" and \\"mischievous sense of humour,\\" and states the final volume was \\"particularly successful in delineating young Artemis‚Äôs move away from self- regard\\". Sharon O'Niell of Irish Independent praised the book as \\"a unique creation, blending fairytales and folklore with hi-tech gadgetry\\" and further wrote: \\"[book is] one of the best in the series and will not disappoint young fans. The ending is appropriately climactic ‚Äì and to give anything away would be far more criminal than anything Artemis has got up to in the past.\\" Another positive review came from Philippine Daily Inquirer's Ruel De Vera, who wrote: \\"Eoin Colfer's 'Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian' is a most fitting final caper for the ever-planning young genius who brought the readers along with him as he went for mere smart bad person into something much, much more.\\" The Last Guardian won the 2012 Irish Book Award in the \\"Irish Children's Book - Senior\\" category.

In the description of his biographer Richard Sudhalter, the song is \\"one of Carmichael's most evocative of the time\\" and addresses \\"the effects of a wayward eye on an avian love relationship\\". The song was one of three Carmichael compositions due to be featured in the 1944 film To Have and Have Not, starring Humphrey Bogart, Carmichael and Lauren Bacall. According to Bacall, Howard Hawks, the film's director, envisioned the song becoming her signature tune. Instead, Bacall sang the less vocally demanding \\"How Little We Know\\", and \\"Baltimore Oriole\\" was relegated to serving as background music in the film. Carmichael recorded the song for his 1956 album Hoagy Sings Carmichael and again for his final album, Ole Buttermilk Sky. Australian composer Andrew Ford, writing for The Sydney Morning Herald in 2002, said that \\"Baltimore Oriole\\" was his personal favorite of Carmichael's songs. Regarding the lyrics, he added: \\"I am delighted to report ... [that] my favourite line turns out to be by Hoagy himself: 'Forgivin' is easy, it's a woman-like now- and-then-could-happen-to thing.'\\" A jazz instrumental version was released in 1964 by Maynard Ferguson on The Blues Roar. A lifelong fan of Carmichael, George Harrison covered the song and Carmichael's \\"Hong Kong Blues\\" on his 1981 album Somewhere in England. In 2007, Rachel Gould and Luigi Tessarollo included \\"Baltimore Oriole\\" among the ten Carmichael songs on their album Tribute to Hoagy Carmichael.

It was also the B-side of the album's lead single, \\"All Those Years Ago\\", which Harrison wrote as a tribute to his former Beatles bandmate John Lennon. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the transient nature of life and the importance of recognising a spiritual purpose. Although the song was written long before Lennon's murder in New York in December 1980, the lyrics' reference to how easily friends can be shot down and killed led listeners to interpret it as a further comment on Lennon's death. Harrison recorded \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" at his Friar Park studio in England in 1980. A sombre and meditative track, it includes Indian classical instrumentation alongside the Western rock backing. The musicians on the recording include Ray Cooper, who plays various percussion instruments, former Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker, and Alla Rakha on tabla. Along with \\"Life Itself\\", \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" marked Harrison's return to philosophical songwriting after his more subtle and light-hearted work since the mid 1970s. Several music critics and commentators recognise the song as a highlight of the otherwise disappointing Somewhere in England album. Harrison agreed to its use in the 1993 audio-book format of author Deepak Chopra's Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, where the track accompanies a passage read by Chopra. Background and inspiration Along with the Somewhere in England track \\"Life Itself\\", \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" represented a return by George Harrison to directly addressing spiritual and philosophical issues in his songwriting.Rodriguez, pp. 386, 433.Snow, p. 69. In his two previous albums, Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976) and George Harrison (1979), Harrison had conveyed his spirituality in subtle terms, whereby his lyrics in praise of the Hindu deity Krishna regularly invited interpretation as standard love songs directed towards a romantic partner. This subtle approach had continued a precedent set after his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, when Harrison's spiritual pronouncements had attracted scorn from many music critics.Lavezzoli, pp. 196‚Äì97.Tillery, pp. 114‚Äì15. As an additional factor by the late 1970s, Harrison had chosen to distance himself from the Hare Krishna MovementAllison, p. 59. following the death of the movement's founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in November 1977.Tillery, p. 128. The song's title is a phrase from the biblical Book of Daniel. While acknowledging that the phrase is commonplace in its own right, theologian Dale Allison cites Harrison's use of it as one of many examples of his acceptance of Christian teaching beside the Hindu influences with which he was more typically associated.Allison, pp. 56‚Äì58. This recognition of Christ was in keeping with a concept espoused by the late Indian yogi Paramahansa Yogananda,Allison, p. 56.Tillery, p. 154. whose teachings had had a significant influence on Harrison since 1966.Harry, p. 320.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 36, 50‚Äì51.Lavezzoli, pp. 177‚Äì78. Composition Allison describes \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" as \\"musically idiosyncratic\\".Allison, p. 160. According to author Simon Leng, the song shares the same contemplative musical mood as two earlier Harrison compositions, \\"Be Here Now\\" and \\"Long, Long, Long\\",Leng, p. 224. both of which carry their melody over an Indian music-style drone, recalling Harrison's period as a sitar student under Shankar in the 1960s.Schaffner, pp. 115, 159. Leng adds that, such was Harrison's disinterest in contemporary musical genres such as disco, new wave and heavy metal,David Cavanagh, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse\\", Uncut, August 2008, p. 48. the song represented \\"a genus all its own\\".Leng, pp. 211‚Äì12, 224. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the transient nature of existenceRodriguez, p. 386. and warns against relying on material things.Allison, pp. 62‚Äì63, 80. Leng considers \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" to be the first song in which Harrison \\"equates music with spirituality\\" and explicitly evokes Nada Brahma, a concept espoused by Indian classical musicians such as Shankar that means \\"sound is God\\".Leng, pp. 24, 224. Amid his warning of life's fleeting qualities, Harrison sings of friends who are \\"drunk away, shot away, or die away from you\\".Inglis, pp. 76‚Äì77. Author Ian Inglis likens the song's message, regarding the need to accept and prepare for death, to a philosophical point espoused by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges. Inglis writes that, like Borges in his poem \\"Limits\\", Harrison fully accepts the impermanence of life and so challenges Dylan Thomas's contention (in \\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\\") that the inevitability of death should be defied until the end.Inglis, p. 77. Recording Harrison recorded \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" during the main sessions for Somewhere in England,Madinger & Easter, p. 459. held at his FPSHOT studio in Oxfordshire between March and September 1980.Badman, p. 263.Inglis, p. 72. Aside from Harrison, who also served as producer,Badman, p. 266. the musicians at the sessions were Neil Larsen and Gary Brooker (both on keyboards), Ray Cooper (percussion), Willie Weeks (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums). In July that year, Harrison was planning to produce an album by Shankar,Badman, p. 254. a project that would have been their first collaboration since recording the Music Festival from India album in 1974 and their subsequent North American tour.Lavezzoli, pp. 195‚Äì96, 197.Shankar, pp. 227‚Äì28. Although the 1980 project did not take place, the song includes a rare contribution to a Western rock recording by tabla player Alla Rakha, Shankar's longtime accompanist.Lavezzoli, pp. 105‚Äì07. Harrison added other Indian instrumentation to the track,Huntley, p. 182. including gubgubbi, a gut-stringed instrument he had also used on the song \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\" in 1974.Leng, pp. 157‚Äì58, 224. Harrison submitted Somewhere in England to Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his Dark Horse record label, in late September 1980,Doggett, p. 267. with \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" sequenced as the second song, following his cover of Hoagy Carmichael's \\"Hong Kong Blues\\".Huntley, pp. 178, 181. Warner's were unimpressed with the album and asked Harrison to rework the content ‚Äì including replacing four of the original songs ‚Äì to ensure the release had more commercial appeal.Rodriguez, p. 433.Snow, pp. 68, 69. Harrison chose to retain \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" over more upbeat and commercial-sounding tracks such as \\"Flying Hour\\" and \\"Lay His Head\\".Clayson, pp. 377‚Äì78.Huntley, p. 178. The song was remixed during the additional sessions for Somewhere in England. Ray Cooper was credited as co-producer on the second version of the album.Leng, p. 213.Harry, p. 349. Release and reception Somewhere in England was released on 1 June 1981.Badman, p. 284.Tillery, p. 164. \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" appeared as the eighth track, between the newly recorded \\"That Which I Have Lost\\" and \\"Hong Kong Blues\\".Madinger & Easter, pp. 461, 636. The song was also issued as the B-side of the lead single, \\"All Those Years Ago\\", which Harrison wrote as a tribute to his former Beatles bandmate John Lennon,Harry, pp. 17, 86. who had been fatally shot in New York City on 8 December 1980.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 181. Its inclusion on the single led many listeners to assume that \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" also addressed Lennon's murder, particularly with the line referring to friends who are unexpectedly \\"shot away\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 461. Author Robert Rodriguez comments that, had the scheduled release of Somewhere in England taken place in late 1980, \\"listeners would doubtless have been chilled by the song's prescience\\". Coinciding with the public's outpouring of grief in reaction to Lennon's death, the single was a top-ten hit in many countries around the world and became Harrison's most successful single since \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\" in 1973.Clayson, p. 378. Among the people he thanked on the inner sleeve of Somewhere in England was Yogananda,Inner sleeve credits, Somewhere in England LP (Dark Horse Records, 1981; produced by George Harrison & Ray Cooper). and he dedicated the album to Lennon's memoryWoffinden, p. 107. with a quote from Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita: \\"There was never a time when I did not exist, nor you. Nor will there be any future when we cease to be.\\"Inglis, p. 73. The quote was followed by Lennon's initials and accompanied by both the Hindu Om symbol and a Christian cross. Although unimpressed with Somewhere in England generally,Huntley, p. 183.Leng, p. 177. Harry Thomas of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Harrison has achieved the supreme gift of communicating, through the abstract medium of music (the words are secondary), a vision of the spiritual world he's glimpsed in his mystical explorations. Side two's \\"Writing's on the Wall,\\" which makes discreet use of Indian instruments, is very nearly as gorgeous and haunting as 'Life Itself,' and a far more imaginative exercise in raga-rock than anything Harrison ever managed as a Beatle.\\"Harry Thomas, \\"George Harrison: Somewhere In England\\", Rolling Stone, 6 August 1981, p. 44 (archived version from 24 November 2007, retrieved 19 November 2016). People magazine's reviewer said that \\"thoughts of eternity haunt even the jauntiest of these tunes ‚Ä¶ In Writing's on the Wall, Harrison writes that 'death holds on to us much more with every passing hour.' This record is both entertainment and a musical giant's defiant tribute to the value of life.\\"\\"Picks and Pans Review: Somewhere in England\\", People, 27 July 1981 (archived version from 27 December 2013, retrieved 19 November 2016). Retrospective assessment and legacy In a gesture that Simon Leng terms \\"unprecedented\\", Harrison authorised the inclusion of \\"Writing's on the Wall\\", together with \\"Life Itself\\" and \\"That Which I Have Lost\\", on the 1993 audio release of Deepak Chopra's bestselling book Ageless Body, Timeless Mind.Leng, p. 326. The track accompanies a passage read by Chopra, who became a friend of Harrison's in the mid 1980s and helped effect a reconciliation between the singer and his former meditation teacher, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in 1991.Tillery, pp. 137‚Äì38, 154. Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense cited the song as an example of the high standard that Harrison consistently applied to his songwriting as a solo artist, such that \\"his work is my choice for best among the ex-Fabs for being the most substantial in melody, structure, and content.\\"Rip Rense, \\"There Went the Sun: Reflection on the Passing of George Harrison\\", rense.com, 29 January 2002 (retrieved 1 December 2016). While he considers both the 1980 and the 1981 versions of the album to be \\"mixed bags\\", former Mojo editor Mat Snow pairs \\"the gentle, thoughtful 'Writing's on the Wall'\\" with \\"Life Itself\\", as the two tracks that \\"stand out as deeply felt returns to singing of his spirituality\\". Leng recognises the same pair of songs as \\"about the only reason to look into the 1981 Somewhere in England\\", with \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" representing \\"the ultimate expression of [Harrison's] introverted music in an extroverted age\\". In his comments on the media attention afforded Harrison after his near-fatal stabbing in December 1999, Leng also remarks on the irony that the issues Harrison had addressed in songs such as \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" \\"were played out before his eyes, with himself as the leading man\\".Leng, p. 283. Ian Inglis admires the synergistic aspect of the song's music and lyrics, a quality that he finds lacking in other tracks on Harrison's most artistically compromised album.Inglis, pp. 76, 78. Inglis adds that the \\"poetic properties of his lyrics are seen here at their best\\" and reflect Harrison's continued ability to \\"use language in expressive ways\\".Inglis, pp. 76, 77. Author Elliot Huntley describes the track as \\"pleasant\\" but seemingly \\"unfinished\\", and suggests that it would have been better served with a full Indian classical arrangement in the style of Harrison's Beatles composition \\"Within You Without You\\".

It was also the B-side of \\"Teardrops\\", which was the second single off the album. An environmental protest song, \\"Save the World\\" was Harrison's first composition to directly address topical issues such as the nuclear arms race, rainforest and wildlife devastation, and the ecologically irresponsible practices of corporate concerns. Musically, the song partly recalls the style of the comedy troupe Monty Python. Harrison recorded \\"Save the World\\" at his Friar Park studio in England in 1980. The recording includes sound effects that support the song's message of a world heading towards self-destruction, including bombs falling, a cash register, a street demonstration, and a nuclear explosion. In 1985, Harrison contributed a version of the song with amended lyrics to Greenpeace's self-titled fundraising album. \\"Save the World\\" also appeared on the home video Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits. Since its release, the song has been held in low regard by several music critics and biographers. Some of these reviewers highlight the disparity between the serious message and the quirky musical backing. In line with Harrison's wishes, a demo of \\"Save the World\\" appeared as the sole bonus track on the posthumously reissued Somewhere in England in 2004. Background and inspiration As reproduced in the 2017 book I, Me, Mine ‚Äì The Extended Edition, George Harrison dated the lyrics of \\"Save the World\\" to 24 February 1978, with Hana, Maui as the location.Harrison, p. 434. During that visit to Hawaii, Harrison completed the writing for his 1979 album George Harrison,Rodriguez, pp. 175, 365‚Äì66. which, as with its predecessor, Thirty Three & 1/3, reflected a light-heartedness that had been lacking in much of his work.Madinger & Easter, p. 457.Woffinden, pp. 103, 106. He returned to the song when working on his album Somewhere in England, most of which was written between mid 1979 and the early part of 1980.Madinger & Easter, p. 459. As with a track Harrison wrote for Somewhere in England, \\"Tears of the World\\",Inglis, pp. 77, 103.Leng, pp. 221, 226. \\"Save the World\\" conveys his disapproval at the ecological issues and political machinations threatening the world in the early 1980s.Allison, pp. 70‚Äì71. During 1980, Harrison became a member of Greenpeace and CND;Leng, p. 214. he also protested against the use of nuclear energy with Friends of the Earth, in London,Badman, p. 248.Harry, p. 85. and helped finance Vole, a green magazine launched by Monty Python member Terry Jones. Author Simon Leng describes \\"Save the World\\" as Harrison's first attempt at ecology-focused songwriting and a \\"quirky protest song\\" that marked \\"the culmination of the Pythonization of Harrison's music\\" at a time when he was increasingly associated with members of the Monty Python comedy troupe through his film company HandMade Films. While recognising \\"Save the World\\" as indicative of its composer's disillusion with the 1980s, Leng comments that Harrison had long valued the \\"madness\\" of Monty Python's comedy as \\"a mirror to the insanity of world events\\", and that his adoption of humour was a \\"peculiarly British\\" reaction to a grave situation. Composition In his lyrics, Harrison sings of \\"This planet's rape, how we've abused it\\".Somewhere in England CD booklet (Dark Horse Records, 2004; produced by George Harrison & Ray Cooper), p. 9. He first addresses the nuclear arms race being waged between the United States and the Soviet Union, and laments the introduction of intergalactic weapons. He then addresses the devastation of the world's rainforests for commercial gain and the threat to wildlife. He refers to the Save the Whales environmental campaign and how Greenpeace's attempts to limit whale hunting had been thwarted by the interests of \\"dog food salesmen\\". He also laments the irresponsibility of arms manufacturers and, with regard to plutonium stockpiles, concludes: \\"Now you can make your own H-bomb / Right in the kitchen with your mom.\\" He then denigrates the use of nuclear power as a \\"half-wit's answer to a need\\" that causes cancer. In the final verse, Harrison attributes the world's environmental problems to just a few profit-seeking individuals. He ends on what he promises to be \\"a happy note\\" by stating that a simple solution lies in the realisation that \\"God [lives] in your heart\\".Allison, pp. 75‚Äì76. In a 1987 interview, Harrison said that \\"Save the World\\" was meant to be \\"serious and funny at the same time\\".Allison, p. 77.J. Kordosh, \\"Fab! Gear! The George Harrison Interview (part 1)\\", Creem, December 1987; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Contrasting with the subject matter, the music recalls the comedy songs of Monty Python.Leng, p. 226.Allison, pp. 70, 153. In the description of Harrison biographer Alan Clayson, the style is \\"quasi-reggae\\",Clayson, p. 381. while author Ian Inglis refers to it being sung on the official recording \\"in a deceptively sweet voice to a march tempo\\".Inglis, p. 77. Leng also likens the song's musical aspects to Harrison's 1975 tribute to comedian Legs Larry Smith, \\"His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)\\", in terms of its groove and musical arrangement. Recording Harrison recorded \\"Save the World\\" during the main sessions for Somewhere in England, held at his FPSHOT studio in Henley, Oxfordshire, between March and September 1980. Aside from Harrison, who played guitars and self-produced the sessions,Badman, p. 266. the musicians on the track were Neil Larsen and Gary Brooker (both on keyboards), Willie Weeks (bass), Jim Keltner (drums), Ray Cooper (percussion) and Tom Scott (horns). Harrison added various sound effects throughout the recording, including the sound of bombs being dropped, a cash register, an army on the march, gunfire, and a street demonstration.Inglis, p. 78. The majority of these effects appear midway through the song, accompanied by a Moog synthesizer solo, after which the section concludes with the sound of a nuclear explosion. A baby's cry then accompanies the song's return. At the end of the track, Harrison edited in the faint sound of a bow-played Indian string instrument, the tar shehnai. This part was taken from \\"Crying\\", an instrumental piece performed by Vinayak VoraAlbum credits, Wonderwall Music CD (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison). and released on Harrison's 1968 soundtrack album Wonderwall Music.Rodriguez, p. 9. When asked about its inclusion in \\"Save the World\\", Harrison told Musician magazine in 1987: \\"I just wanted to let the whole song go out with something sad, to touch that nerve and maybe make you think, 'Ohhh shit.'\\" After submitting Somewhere in England to Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his Dark Horse record label, in late September 1980,Doggett, p. 267. Harrison was forced to rework the content of the albumClayson, pp. 377‚Äì78. ‚Äì including replacing four of the original songs ‚Äì to ensure the release had more commercial appeal.Rodriguez, p. 433. Harrison chose to retain \\"Save the World\\" in the revised track listing and worked with Ray Cooper on a second version of the album. Although the mix for the re-submitted \\"Save the World\\" differed little from Harrison's original,Madinger & Easter, p. 461. Cooper was credited as a co-producer.Harry, p. 349. Release and reception Somewhere in England was released on 1 June 1981,Badman, p. 284.Tillery, p. 164. with \\"Save the World\\" sequenced as the final track.Harry, pp. 349‚Äì50. It was the only song from Harrison's initial submission to Warner Bros. to retain its position in the running order of the official release. The album was a relative commercial success,Ingham, pp. 129, 136. an outcome that was due largely to a public outpouring of grief in reaction to the murder of Harrison's former Beatles bandmate John Lennon in December 1980.Larkin, pp. 2646‚Äì47.Leng, pp. 217‚Äì18.Madinger & Easter, pp. 459‚Äì60. As a follow-up single to Harrison's tribute to Lennon, \\"All Those Years Ago\\", Warner's released \\"Teardrops\\",Clayson, p. 378. which was another of the album's four replacement tracks.Huntley, p. 179. This release took place on 20 July 1981, with \\"Save the World\\" appearing as the single's B-side.Madinger & Easter, p. 633. In his album review for Creem magazine, Mitchell Cohen called Harrison a \\"C‚Äì thinker\\" and ridiculed the lyrics of \\"Save the World\\" with the comment: \\"Harrison comes out against paper towels (!!) (expect a rebuttal on the next Nancy Walker album) and whalemeat used as dogfood (ditto Lorne Greene).\\"Mitchell Cohen, \\"George Harrison: Somewhere In England\\", Creem, September 1981; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). In another unfavourable review,Huntley, p. 183.Leng, p. 177. Harry Thomas of Rolling Stone opined that \\"Social commentary and ironic wit clearly remain outside the scope of Harrison's very real talents\\" and wrote of \\"Save the World\\": \\"Veering uncertainly between whimsy and dour warnings, the song ultimately fails either to galvanize or amuse.\\"Harry Thomas, \\"George Harrison: Somewhere In England\\", Rolling Stone, 6 August 1981, p. 44 (archived version from 24 November 2007, retrieved 19 November 2016). Conversely, NME critic Bob Woffinden welcomed the song as an example of how the album's subject matter ranged beyond the \\"humdrum\\", and he found it \\"only characteristic of [Harrison] to embrace more universal themes\\".Woffinden, p. 107. Greenpeace version Harrison revisited \\"Save the World\\" in 1985 when Greenpeace UK approached him for a contribution to an album intended to raise fundsClayson, p. 388. for their environmental efforts. Harrison amended the lyrics slightly to include further references to Greenpeace,Harry, p. 329. along with a spoken comment that conveyed his disgust with the power of corporations: \\"You greedy bastards\\". In addition to recording a new vocal, he remixed the musical backing, giving more prominence to some of the guitar parts.Huntley, p. 196. Rainbow Warrior. The video clip for \\"Save the World\\" used footage of the ship and of Greenpeace's activities to protect the environment.

The inclusion of \\"Save the World\\" on Greenpeace marked a rare new musical release for Harrison between 1983 and 1986,Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 53.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 189‚Äì90. when he was otherwise engaged in film production with the continued success of HandMade.Leng, pp. 239‚Äì43.Inglis, pp. 84‚Äì86.Larkin, p. 2647. Over the same period, however, he became increasingly involved in environmental matters; these activities included attending an anti-nuclear demonstration in London's Trafalgar Square,Badman, p. 373. voicing support for the British Green Party, and inspiring a successful campaign to stop the John Lewis Partnership from demolishing Henley's Regal Cinema and building a supermarket complex.Clayson, pp. 388‚Äì90.Harry, p. 91. The song was also included in the video compilation Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits, released in December 1985,Badman, p. 362. five months after the French intelligence services' sinking of the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior.Paul Brown & Rob Evans, \\"How Rainbow Warrior was played down\\", The Guardian, 23 August 2005 (retrieved 20 November 2016). Produced by Ian Weiner, the clip for \\"Save the World\\" consisted of scenes of Rainbow Warrior and Greenpeace personnel at work on their international activist campaigns. Retrospective assessment and legacy Until his death in November 2001, Harrison continued to express alarm at the ecological issues facing the world.Tillery, p. 147.Allison, pp. 70, 74‚Äì75. He dedicated his 1989 compilation album Best of Dark Horse to Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and \\"anyone interested in saving our planet\\";Harry, p. 28. in the revised artwork for the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass, he included a series of images showing the gradual encroachment of pollution and industry onto the Friar Park scene depicted on that album's 1970 cover photo.Huntley, p. 305.Tillery, pp. 146‚Äì47. As a songwriter, he revisited the themes of \\"Save the World\\" in \\"Cockamamie Business\\", a new song issued on Best of Dark Horse,Allison, pp. 70, 139.Madinger & Easter, pp. 477‚Äì78. and in the title track to his final studio album, the posthumously released Brainwashed.Inglis, pp. 100, 141. In the 1990s, Harrison's elder sister, Louise, used \\"Save the World\\" as the soundtrack for a series of public service radio segments she produced, titled Good Earthkeeping Tips, which offered information on environmental issues.Clayson, p. 462.Harry, p. 222. In keeping with Harrison's instructions for the reissuing of his Dark Horse catalogue,Leng, pp. 312‚Äì13. a demo of the song appeared as the sole bonus track on the 2004 reissue of Somewhere in England.John Metzger, \\"George Harrison The Dark Horse Years (Part Three: Somewhere in England)\\", The Music Box, vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 20 November 2016). Writing for Uncut in March 2017, Neil Spencer highlighted \\"Save the World\\" as one of the \\"[unexpected] delights\\" among Harrison's 1980s releases, and said that while it was dismissed as \\"soft protest\\" originally, the song is \\"beautifully played and never more relevant than today\\".Neil Spencer, \\"George Harrison ‚Äì The Vinyl Collection\\", uncut.co.uk, 27 March 2017 (retrieved 30 November 2017). \\"Save the World\\" is held in low regard by several Harrison and Beatles biographers. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe it as \\"a wholly unappealing track\\" on which the \\"heavyhandedness\\" of the lyrics is completely at odds with the musical mood. Ian Inglis echoes this view, deeming the lyrics \\"trite to the point of being risible\\" and the combination of an unfocused narrative and the overuse of sound effects to be as unsuccessful as the Beatles' work during the Magical Mystery Tour era.Inglis, pp. 77‚Äì78. Although he concedes that the scarcity of environmental songs in the early 1980s, relative to the 1990s, might be a mitigating factor, Inglis dismisses the song as a \\"hopelessly vague indictment of the perils we are inflicting around the globe\\", adding: \\"The problem with such a general attack is that it lacks focus and, therefore, force.\\" Alan Clayson views Harrison's conservationist sentiments as \\"laudable\\" and considers the track to be a protest song in the mould of Barry McGuire's 1965 hit \\"Eve of Destruction\\", yet he also identifies the lack of subtlety as betraying \\"the impartiality of one long and, perhaps, guiltily isolated from the everyday\\". Dale Allison recognises it as \\"the most extensive expression of George's ecological anxiety\\" and a sincere statement, particularly as Harrison chose to revisit the track for the Greenpeace album.Allison, pp. 70‚Äì71, 154. However, Allison deems it to be a \\"strange song\\" with a \\"jarring disjunction between lyric and sound\\", and he says that as with Harrison's other songs about pollution and environmental issues, his message reflects a romanticism that was born out of 1960s radicalism but fails to convince in the manner of Neil Young's \\"After the Gold Rush\\".Allison, pp. 70‚Äì71, 75. Simon Leng finds \\"Save the World\\" closer in style to Monty Python's \\"Eric the Half-a-Bee\\" than to a genuine environmental song such as \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\" by Marvin Gaye. He describes the Somewhere in England version as \\"horribly overproduced\\" next to the \\"charming\\" demo, which \\"is more Dylan than Monty Python\\".Leng, p. 312.

He was a member of the Dutch Jewish council () during the Second World War. Biography S√ºskind was born in L√ºdenscheid in Germany as the first child of Hermann S√ºskind and Frieda Kessler. He had two younger brothers, Karl S√ºskind (1908) and Alfred S√ºskind (1911).Joods Historisch Museum: Walter S√ºskind S√ºskind initially worked as a manager of a margarine factory in Germany. In March 1938, he fled to the Netherlands with the intention to emigrate to the United States, because of the persecution of Jews by the Nazis. From 1942 until his deportation to Westerbork, he lived at Nieuwe Prinsengracht 51 in the center of Amsterdam with his wife Johanna Natt (1 November 1906 ‚Äì 1944) and their daughter Yvonne S√ºskind.KRO Profiel: Walter S√ºskind During the Second World War he became involved in helping children escape the Holocaust via the nursery on the Plantage Middenlaan in Amsterdam. S√ºskind worked for the Dutch Jewish council. He was the manager of the Hollandsche Schouwburg (Dutch Theater), where the Jews of Amsterdam had to report themselves prior to their deportation to the Westerbork transit camp.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- europe-43569049 In that position he could manipulate the personal data of children in particular. His close relationship with the German authorities helped him in his activities to help children escape. He especially tried to get close with the SS officer Ferdinand aus der F√ºnten, who was then the second man of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Amsterdam.KRO Profiel: Walter S√ºskind Opposite of the Hollandsche Schouwburg on the Plantage Middenlaan, there was a nursery. The Nazis put the young children there instead of in the theater. The Jewish director of the nursery, Henriette Henriques Pimentel, together with S√ºskind and economist Felix Halverstad (who also worked at the Hollandsche Schouwburg), set up a system to rescue children via the nursery. Children were secretly brought to the Hervormde Kweekschool (Reformed Teacher Training College), two houses from the theater. They got there through the garden. They received help from the head of the school, Johan van Hulst.Joods Historisch Museum: Walter S√ºskind From there, the children went into a backpack, shopping bag or laundry basket to be transported to Limburg and Friesland by train and tram, often with help from the Utrechts Kindercomit√© (Utrecht Children's Committee) of Piet Meerburg and the NV, a secret organization that managed to organize many addresses in Limburg. S√ºskind and Felix Halverstad ensured that these children were not registered and removed their names from the records of the theater. Thanks to this plan, about 600 children were saved. In 1944, S√ºskind, his wife and his daughter were sent to the Westerbork transit camp. Due to his good relations with the SS leadership of the Dutch Theater, he could return to Amsterdam, but he eventually went back to his family in Westerbork. He also wanted to let people escape from the transit camp, but failed. His wife and daughter later died at the camp they were sent to, and he himself died on 28 February 1945 at an unknown location in central Europe during the death marches. Movie On 19 January 2012, the Dutch movie S√ºskind was released. This movie is based on the life of Walter S√ºskind. Book A book titled \\"S√ºskind\\" written by Dutch author described Walter S√ºskinds life when working for the Hollandsche Schouwburg.

Harrison wrote the song in India in 1968 while he and the Beatles were studying Transcendental Meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The theme of the lyrics is reincarnation. The composition reflects the cyclical aspect of human existence as, according to Hindu doctrine, the soul continues to pass from one life to the next. Although the Beatles never formally recorded it, \\"Circles\\" was among the demos the group made at Harrison's Esher home, Kinfauns, in May 1968, while considering material for their double album The Beatles. Harrison revisited \\"Circles\\" during the sessions for his 1979 album George Harrison before he finally recorded it for Gone Troppo. Over this period, Harrison had softened the spiritual message in his work and had also begun to forgo the music business for a career as a film producer with his company HandMade Films. The song was produced by Harrison, Ray Cooper and former Beatles engineer Phil McDonald, with recording taking place at Harrison's Friar Park studio between May and August 1982. The track features extensive use of keyboards and synthesizer, with Billy Preston, Jon Lord and Mike Moran among the contributing musicians. A slow, meditative song, \\"Circles\\" has received a varied response from reviewers. While some find it overly gloomy, others recognise the track as a highlight of a generally overlooked album. In the United States, it was issued as the B-side of the album's second single, \\"I Really Love You\\", in February 1983. As the closing track on Gone Troppo, \\"Circles\\" was the last song heard on a new Harrison album until 1987, when he returned with Cloud Nine. In November 2018, the Esher demo of \\"Circles\\" was officially released as a bonus track on the 50th anniversary edition of The Beatles. Background and inspiration Meditation caves at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's former ashram in Rishikesh, where Harrison wrote the song \\"Circles\\" was one of several songs that George Harrison wrote in Rishikesh, India,Madinger & Easter, p. 464.Badman, p. 300. when he and his Beatles bandmates were attending Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation course in the spring of 1968.Everett, pp. 199, 202‚Äì03.Shea & Rodriguez, p. 301. Aside from providing an opportunity to progress with meditation,Paytress, pp. 12, 13‚Äì14. the two-month stay marked the start of Harrison's return to the guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar, partly under the tutelage of Ravi Shankar.Leng, p. 34. During those years, according to Harrison, he only played guitar while working with the Beatles.Mitchell Glazer, \\"Growing Up at 33‚Öì: The George Harrison Interview\\", Crawdaddy, February 1977, p. 41. Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers that \\"Circles\\" was composed on an organ, however, as most of Harrison's Indian-inspired melodies since 1966 had been ‚Äì among them, \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and parts of his Wonderwall Music soundtrack album.Leng, pp. 32, 34, 50, 236. Leng writes of \\"fugue-like keyboard parts\\" on the song and \\"bass figures\\" that partly recall the works of Johann Sebastian Bach.Leng, pp. 232, 236. The song's lyrical theme is reincarnation, in keeping with Harrison's immersion in Hindu philosophy.Allison, pp. 44‚Äì45, 79‚Äì80. This preoccupation had led the Beatles to the Maharishi's teachingsNick Jones, \\"Beatle George And Where He's At\\", Melody Maker, 16 December 1967; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 139. and would result in Harrison's introduction to the Hare Krishna movement in December 1968.Tillery, pp. 69‚Äì71.Michael Simmons, \\"Cry for a Shadow\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 80. Theologian Dale Allison highlights \\"Circles\\" as the only Harrison song to use the term \\"reincarnate\\", and he also notes the composer's use of the word \\"soul\\" \\"in its proper metaphysical sense\\".Allison, p. 82. Harrison also quotes from the Chinese philosopher and author Lao-Tse, whose work Tao Te Ching inspired his 1968 composition \\"The Inner Light\\", which was released as the B-side of the Beatles' \\"Lady Madonna\\" single while the band were away in Rishikesh.Lavezzoli, pp. 183‚Äì84.Tillery, p. 63. The lyrics to \\"Circles\\" were incomplete when Harrison first taped a demo of the song.Huntley, p. 186.Everett, p. 163. He subsequently added further verses before making the official recording, as a solo artist, in 1982. Composition In the description of musicologist Walter Everett, the musical aspects of the 1968 version of \\"Circles\\" include a \\"singularly expressive common-tone modulation\\" over a semitone descent from the chord of C minor to B minor.Everett, p. 349. Harrison changed the key for the official recording, where the song is played in the key of F major. In this final form, the structure comprises two verses and a chorus (or \\"bridge\\", as Harrison terms it on his handwritten manuscript); a repeat of this combination, with an instrumental passage over the second section of verse; and two further verses, followed by an extended instrumental passage.Harrison, p. 461. Leng views the \\"chromatic melodic web\\" of \\"Circles\\" as appropriate for conveying the \\"repetition and entrapment\\" of reincarnation, as the soul passes through one human life to another. He says that the melody \\"yearn[s] for resolution in E minor ‚Ä¶ revolving in dissonance like a lost soul awaiting its place in the reincarnation checkout line\\". Author Ian Inglis writes that, musically and lyrically, \\"Circles\\" \\"displays a direct connection with the unspoken psychedelia\\" of Harrison's Beatles tracks \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Long, Long, Long\\".Inglis, p. 83. Allison describes the lyrics as \\"a clear statement of reincarnation\\", as well as \\"the most blatant example\\" of Harrison's desire to pass on to a \\"'higher' and better world\\" at death, and so escape the cycle of rebirth in the material world.Allison, pp. 82, 139. The choruses include the lines from Lao-Tse: \\"He who knows does not speak / He who speaks does not know\\". Elsewhere in \\"Circles\\", Harrison contemplates the changing nature of friendship as, over the course of lifetimes, in Inglis's description, \\"our enemies become our companions, affections turn into hatred\\". On the released recording, Harrison concludes with a statement on how to break the circle of repetition:Allison, pp. 82‚Äì83. \\"When loss and gain and up and down / Becomes the same, then we stop going in circles.\\"Harrison, p. 460. Allison interprets this conclusion, and Harrison's worldview generally, as espousing the need to recognise the illusory nature of the material world, saying: \\"All the multiplicity and diversity are in truth manifestations of the one hidden and divine reality ‚Ä¶ opposites are not opposites. To understand that up is down and that gain is loss is to be ‚Ä¶ on one's way to escaping from the material world.\\"Allison, p. 83. The Beatles' demo \\"Circles\\" was one of the five Harrison compositions,MacDonald, p. 244. out of a total of 23 songs,Womack, p. 364. that the Beatles demoed before recording their 1968 double album, The Beatles (also known as the \\"White Album\\").Unterberger, pp. 195, 197.Winn, pp. 169, 170. The song was taped in late May 1968Miles, p. 299. at Kinfauns, Harrison's home in Esher,Womack, p. 185. using his Ampex four-track recorder.Unterberger, p. 197.Everett, pp. 163, 202. Harrison sang and played organ on the track,Quantick, p. 160. taping two parts on the instrument.Winn, p. 170. The use of keyboards contrasted with the mainly acoustic-guitar backing employed on the Beatles' Esher demos; author and critic Richie Unterberger describes the keyboard sound as \\"an eerie organ that seems to have been dragged out of a dusty, disused church closet\\".Unterberger, p. 198. In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald identifies the instrument as a harmonium and writes that, rather than performing the song alone, Harrison was \\"shadowed by a tentative ‚Ä¶ bass-line\\" from Paul McCartney.MacDonald, p. 244fn. As with another Harrison song inspired by the Beatles' stay in RishikeshWomack, p. 857. ‚Äì \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" ‚Äì the group did not attempt to record \\"Circles\\" for the White Album.Unterberger, pp. 198, 349. This partly reflected Harrison's junior position to John Lennon and McCartney as a songwriter in the Beatles;Quantick, pp. 108, 110‚Äì11. in an interview conducted later in 1968,Alan Smith, \\"George Is a Rocker Again!

With the band's songwriting output at an unprecedentedly high level,Hertsgaard, p. 251.Paytress, p. 15. Harrison's \\"Not Guilty\\" was similarly left off the album,Goldmine staff, \\"Cover Story ‚Äì The White Album: Artistic zenith or full of filler? Part II\\", Goldmine, 16 October 2008 (retrieved 5 August 2015). even though the group completed a studio recording of that track in London.Miles, pp. 305‚Äì06.MacDonald, pp. 267‚Äì68. Not released officially until 2018, the demo of \\"Circles\\", along with the Beatles' Esher recordings of \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" and \\"Not Guilty\\", began circulating on bootleg compilations in the early 1990s.Winn, p. 171. All the Esher demos, including these three recordings, were finally remixed in stereo and released in November 2018 for the fiftieth anniversary deluxe editions of the White Album.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/beatles-white- album-super-deluxe-is-a-revelatory-dive-into-their-frayed-late-sixties- drama-753695/ Recording In 1978, Harrison returned to both \\"Circles\\" and \\"Not Guilty\\" during the sessions for his sixth post-Beatles solo album, George Harrison.Madinger & Easter, pp. 457, 464.Badman, pp. 221, 300. Although \\"Not Guilty\\" appeared on that release the following year,Clayson, p. 368. \\"Circles\\" remained unused until 1982, when Harrison again revisited it while working on Gone Troppo.Shea & Rodriguez, p. 302. By this point in his career, Harrison had long softened the spiritual message of his workLavezzoli, p. 197. and, since the late 1970s, he had distanced himself from the Hare Krishna movement.Tillery, p. 128. Allison notes that Harrison nevertheless gave an in- depth interview to senior devotee Mukunda Goswami in September 1982,Allison, p. 47. during which he shared his thoughts on reincarnation, meditation and chanting.Chant and Be Happy, p. 2. Jon Lord, Harrison's near-neighbour in South Oxfordshire, played one of the keyboard parts on \\"Circles\\" Harrison recorded \\"Circles\\" at his Friar Park studio, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, during sessions held between 5 May and 27 August 1982. He co-produced the track with Ray CooperInglis, p. 79. and former Beatles engineer Phil McDonald.Madinger & Easter, p. 462. The backing musicians included keyboard players Billy Preston, Jon Lord and Mike Moran; Harrison also played synthesizer,Leng, p. 235. in addition to bass\\"Circles\\", Gone Troppo CD booklet (Dark Horse Records, 2004; produced by George Harrison, Ray Cooper & Phil McDonald). and slide guitar. Leng describes the song as Harrison's \\"first Hindustani blues\\" and, unlike the sparse 1968 recording, a track arranged with \\"rich instrumentation\\" that includes \\"gospel flourishes\\" from Preston, on piano and Hammond organ, and \\"Harrison's unique guitar tones\\". Leng also comments on the seemingly unlikely pairing of Harrison and Lord, who was the keyboardist for the heavy rock bands Deep Purple and Whitesnake.Romanowski & George-Warren, pp. 251, 1071. Acknowledging the close friendship between the two near-neighbours, Leng cites Lord's presence on the track as indicative of a preference for locally sourced contributors and \\"trusted pals\\" when Harrison made Gone Troppo.Leng, pp. 229‚Äì30, 236. As another factor in the album's creation, Harrison felt increasingly removed from contemporary musical trends and more involved with his film company, HandMade,Leng, pp. 229‚Äì30. whose recent successes had included Terry Gilliam's 1981 fantasy adventure Time Bandits.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 204.Clayson, pp. 372‚Äì73. While viewing \\"Circles\\" as \\"a throwback to the early days of enlightenment in the 1960s\\", Leng writes that the \\"ponderous, stuttering, meditative pace and bizarre, circular melodic structure\\" of the song evokes \\"the feeling of being transported to one of the parallel realities\\" depicted in Gilliam's film. Release \\"Circles\\" was issued on 5 November 1982Madinger & Easter, p. 636. as the closing track on Gone Troppo, sequenced after Harrison's song from the Time Bandits soundtrack, \\"Dream Away\\".Inglis, pp. 83, 151‚Äì52. By this point, \\"Circles\\" had gained a degree of notoriety, as a title that frequently appeared on lists of the Beatles' unreleased compositions. The album's arrival coincided with heavy marketing of the Beatles' past work and a new television documentary,Doggett, pp. 280‚Äì81. as part of the twentieth-anniversary celebrations of the band's debut single, \\"Love Me Do\\".Badman, pp. 305‚Äì07.Huntley, pp. 190, 192. Writing in Mojo in 2011, John Harris described \\"Circles\\" as \\"one bit of Fabs-related intrigue\\" on a release that otherwise received little notice, due to Harrison's refusal to promote his \\"contract- finisher\\" with Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his Dark Horse record label.John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 83. Author Alan Clayson comments that the song's \\"sense of once more going through the old routine\\" seemingly reflected the artist's disenchantment after Warner's had rejected part of the content of his previous album, Somewhere in England.Clayson, p. 392. Gone Troppo became Harrison's last album for five years,Romanowski & George-Warren, pp. 419, 420. during which he continued to focus on film production, while occasionally contributing to film soundtracks.Leng, pp. 239‚Äì41, 243.Inglis, pp. 84‚Äì86. Among these projects, the 1985 HandMade comedy Water reunited four of the musicians who played on \\"Circles\\", as Moran wrote part of the film score (with Harrison),Leng, pp. 239‚Äì40. and Harrison, Lord, Moran and CooperInglis, p. 85. made a cameo appearance as \\"the Singing Rebels Band\\", along with Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr.Badman, p. 351.Huntley, p. 195. In February 1983, \\"Circles\\" was released as the B-side to the album's second single in the United States, \\"I Really Love You\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 633. Critical reception Discussing the reception to Gone Troppo in their book Eight Arms to Hold You, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter identify \\"Circles\\" as the only track \\"reflecting weightier matters\\" on what was otherwise Harrison's \\"frothiest\\" collection of songs to date, and they conclude: \\"Sadly, a decent album was lost in the shuffle of the rapidly changing marketplace of the early '80's.\\"Madinger & Easter, pp. 462‚Äì63. In his contemporary review for Musician magazine, Roy Trakin wrote that, following Lennon's murder two years before, Harrison's \\"tortured honesty\\" undermined the album's \\"attempt to heal those psychic wounds with calm, offhanded music\\". He said that \\"not even Billy Preston can rescue ‚Ä¶ the maudlin tautologies of the closing 'Circles'.\\"Roy Trakin, \\"George Harrison: Gone Troppo\\", Musician, January 1983; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). More impressed with Gone Troppo, Dave Thompson wrote in Goldmine in 2002 that, together with \\"Dream Away\\", \\"Circles\\" \\"stand[s] alongside any number of Harrison's minor classics\\".Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 53. Writing in 2017, Jamie Atkins of Record Collector also challenged the poor reputation that the album had gained. Among its highlights, he said that \\"Circles turns the creepy, bad acid vibes of [Harrison's] 1968 demo into one of his finest solo tracks.\\"Jamie Atkins, \\"Apple Buff: George Harrison ‚Äì The Vinyl Collection\\", Record Collector, March 2017 (retrieved 4 February 2017). In his book The Unreleased Beatles, Richie Unterberger describes the song as \\"a pretty neat, if droning, reflection of Harrison's more somber spiritual sensibilities\\". He views the 1968 demo as a version that \\"exerts by far the greater fascination\\" compared with Harrison's later recording.Unterberger, p. 198. Author John Winn dismisses \\"Circles\\" as \\"a depressing number that makes 'Blue Jay Way' sound like a Little Richard freakout\\", while Ian MacDonald describes it as \\"a typically perceptive, if deeply gloomy, song about karma\\". Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley dismisses the 1982 version as Harrison's \\"worst-ever composition\\", adding: \\"A heavy, spiritual dirge, somehow redolent of 'Blue Jay Way,' but different inasmuch as it's nowhere near as good ‚Ä¶ you can almost hear the song-writing barrel being scraped.\\" By contrast, Simon Leng admires \\"Circles\\" as \\"one of [its] composer's most complex pieces\\", and he pairs the song with \\"Beware of Darkness\\" as \\"a study in Harrison's unique harmonic sense\\".Leng, p. 236. In light of its release as the final track on Gone Troppo, Leng adds: \\"'Circles' was so personal and eccentric that it seemed to close the book on George's recording career. It felt like he was making music only for himself.\\"Leng, p. 237.

Notable projects  = Bhadli Village of Bhuj = Bhadli Village is located 40 km northwest of Bhuj. The village was destroyed by 6.9 Richter scale earthquake. Somaya included all the villagers for the reconstruction to restore the unique identity of the village. She involved the Muslims family and assigned them for making intricate Bandhani (tie and dye-a fabric work), Patelbhai who were interested in the ecology of the village and employed skilled engineers to create a water reservoir to collect rain water. Her main focus for this project was to design in a way which promoted a healthy and hygienic environment. She designed the houses in a way which barred the dust and intense heat of the desert. There were minimized openings and concrete jaalis were used for the exchange of air for minimum sunlight and dust. Also, a cluster of 5-6 houses was made to create a close-knit community for the villagers. A separate space was created for the livestock and precious possessions. To restore fear in people, a 3 RCC plinth Beam was placed: one in the sill, one in the lintel and one in the roof base. The project maximized reusing the materials by reusing the debris, doors and windows. The trust agreed to provide materials while the labour was provided by the villagers so that the villagers. A school in Bhadli was rebuilt in 2002, a primary coed school with 194 students and 6 teachers. A temporary school was built initially so that the students could continue their education. Somaya worked closely with villagers and used locally available materials to save money. = St. Thomas Cathedral = St. Thomas Cathedral, the oldest Anglican Church in Mumbai was a 298-year structure when Somaya was contacted. The Cathedral had a leak on the concrete slab of the flat roof. She did not have many photographs for reference so had to rely on a black and white image of the original roof. A Grade-I Heritage Structure was successfully restored for which Somaya won the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Award. = Nalanda International School = Built on 12 acres of land near Vadodara in Gujarat, Nalanda International School started its construction in 2003. 4 acres of land was separated for the sports and games facilities. Somaya reflected the tradition of Jaipur in her project by using the local brick produced by the local masons. She designed the projects to ensure peace and tranquillity to the students as well as for sustainability. = Other projects = * Nalanda International School, Vadodara * Goa Institute of Management, Goa * Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences, Pilani * Zensar Technology Limited, Pune * TCS House, Mumbai *St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai * Rehabilitation of Bhadli Village along with its School and community Center, Bhuj * Restoration of the Indian Institute of Management ‚ÄìAhmedabad (IIM-A) Louis Kahn Campus  Personal life  Somaya has been married to Anand Somaya, a cardiac surgeon for over 42 years.

It was also issued as a promotional single in the United States, where it peaked at number 9 on Billboards Album Rock Tracks chart. Co-produced by Jeff Lynne, the recording features guitar interplay between Harrison, on slide guitar, and Eric Clapton. Harrison performed the song in concert throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Clapton and in 1992. A live version appears on Harrison's Live in Japan album, while the original studio recording was included on his 1989 compilation Best of Dark Horse. Lyrics and music Having become disillusioned by the music industry and contemporary musical trends, George Harrison spent the four years following the release of his 1982 album Gone Troppo engaged in film production with his company HandMade and enjoying leisure pursuits such as travel. After completing the soundtrack to the HandMade production Shanghai Surprise, he started work on a new album, with co-producer Jeff Lynne, in January 1987. \\"Cloud 9\\" was the first song Harrison wrote for the album, originating as far back as the winter of 1983‚Äì84. Although the album was titled Cloud Nine, Harrison decided to use the numeric \\"9\\" in the song's title to avoid confusion with the Tempations' 1968 hit song \\"Cloud Nine\\". Music lecturer Ian Inglis described the theme of the song as \\"a declaration of altuistic love and a promise of a blissful future\\". Harrison offers his love, time, heart and more to the listener, but allowing her to leave at any time. The singer acknowledges that the listener may \\"make it all on your own\\". In Harrison's description, the song \\"is about everybody looking for something good\\", and he added: \\"If there's any love around, you can have it, but if there's any bad about, well, I'll keep that bit from you ‚Ä¶\\" The music of \\"Cloud 9\\" is similar to the blues. Harrison biographer Elliot J. Huntley describes it as having a \\"J. J. Cale meets the East\\" atmosphere. Simon Leng, writing in his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, describes the music as \\"harmonically simple\\" and propelled by a \\"pounding rock beat\\". Leng identifies the song's raison d'√™tre as the interaction between Harrison's slide guitar and Eric Clapton's \\"thick- toned Stratocaster\\". He describes this interplay as representing a \\"mature conclusion\\" in the guitarists' long musical relationship, and a performance that \\"speaks of empathy, not gun-slinging competitiveness\\". Inglis also praised the interaction between the two guitarists, as well as Jim Horn's saxophone playing. Leng described the saxophone parts on \\"Cloud 9\\" as reminiscent of that on Harrison's Beatle song \\"Savoy Truffle\\". Both Inglis and Leng noted that Harrison's voice is deeper on \\"Cloud 9\\" than it had been in the past, and Inglis credited this for enhancing the maturity of the song's message. Inglis credited Lynne for not embellishing the song with extravagant overdubs as he used for his ELO songs. Leng noted that Lynne emphasised the basic rock rhythm by incorporating the bass drum and bass guitar high in the mix. Release and reception Cloud Nine was released on Harrison's Dark Horse record label on 2 November 1987, with the title song sequenced as the opening track. \\"Cloud 9\\" was issued as a promotional single in the United States in early 1988. It reached number 9 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, David Wild described the album as an \\"expertly crafted, endlessly infectious record\\" and said that the title track was \\"a surprisingly hard-edged midtempo rocker that features some tastily restrained riffing from Harrison and Eric Clapton\\". David Wagner of the Santa Cruz Sentinel paired it with \\"Devil's Radio\\" from the same album as perhaps \\"some of the best two-guitar rock ever recorded\\". AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine views it as one of the \\"best moments\\" on Cloud Nine. Harrison described \\"Cloud 9\\" as a \\"good opener\\" and \\"the kind of song that is not expected of me\\". According to Huntley, Harrison underestimated the track; Huntley calls it a \\"great opener\\". In Leng's opinion, the song is an \\"exercise in blandness\\", containing many \\"hallmarks of stadium rock nothingness\\" and lyrics that are \\"nonthreatening\\" and \\"meaningless\\". While admiring the guitar work, however, he remarks that Harrison's \\"personality\\" is still evident, despite the generic 1980s production, and acknowledges that, after his five- year absence, \\"'Cloud 9' gave notice that George Harrison was back as a force to be reckoned with.\\" Harrison biographer Graeme Thomson was also unimpressed, stating that it sounded like Harrison's personality had been \\"surgically removed\\", calling the song \\"a generic piece of throbbing minor-key blues-rock which would have sounded equally at home on an album by Eric Clapton ‚Ä¶ or Gary Moore\\". \\"Cloud 9\\" was included on Harrison's 1989 compilation album Best of Dark Horse 1976‚Äì1989. Harrison played it in live performances in 1991 and 1992, including his final full live concert at Royal Albert Hall in England on 6 April 1992. A live performance recorded during Harrison's 1991 Japanese tour with Clapton was included on the live album Live in Japan. According to Inglis, the call and response vocals between Harrison and backing vocalists give this version a \\"more soulful feel\\" than the version on Cloud Nine.

Now an antiques warehouse The Cambrian Railways works is a former railway engineering building located in Oswestry, Shropshire. Formed from a series of regional railway companies, in July 1865 the Cambrian Railways company extended an Amalgamation Act to include the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway. Having built Oswestry railway station, and relocated its headquarters there, the company need a new railway works. The site chosen was to the north of the station on Gobowen Road, and its construction hastened Oswestery's boom as a railway town, from a population of 5,500 in 1861, to nearly 10,000 40 years later. Built of local red brick and costing ¬£28,000, the locomotive erecting shop had a central traverser which was hand-moved, serving 12 roads on each side. Apart from the entrance and exit roads, each of the 22 other roads could accommodate a single locomotive or other piece of rolling stock, which again had to be moved into the roads by hand. On the far north end of the works, 11 sidings accessed a carriage and wagon works. Power to the machines was provided by a large steam engine via overhead shafting and belts. The chimney is still a local landmark. The works undertook most of the casting, fabrication, assembly and repairs for the Cambrian Railways. But whilst many carriages and wagons were built in the workshops, only two locomotives were actually constructed at Oswestry, although many were extensively rebuilt. After the Cambrian Railways was taken over by the Great Western Railway on grouping in 1923, the GWR kept it open as a regional carriage and wagon works, and locomotive repair shop for the associated locomotive shed. After becoming part of the London Midland Region in 1963, the depot closed in January 1965, the works in early 1966. A Grade II listed building, since closure the works' buildings have been used an antiques centre, small business hub and document storage centre. In July 2011, after extensive renovation to the southern section of the buildings, Oswestry Health Centre opened on this site as a multi-purpose outpatient healthcare centre. Services are provided by Shropshire Community Health Trust, South Staffordshire and Shropshire Mental Health Foundation Trust, The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust and Cambrian Medical Practice. A Minor Injury Unit (MIU) is also housed at the Oswestry Health Centre and opens from 8:30am to 6pm, Monday to Friday, and 8:30am to 1pm on Saturday and Sunday. X-Ray services are also available at the MIU from 10am until 2pm, Monday to Friday. In December 2012, a new community ambulance station opened at the Oswestry Health Centre. The new facility has parking for ambulances, rapid response vehicles and ambulance crew. It is also the base for the town's 'round-the clock' dedicated community paramedics.

It was not released commercially as a single, but a promotional single was released and the song reached #4 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. Lyrics and music \\"Devil's Radio\\" was inspired by a church billboard Harrison had seen stating \\"Gossip: The Devil's Radio...Don't Be a Broadcaster.\\" The song's theme is an attack on gossip, trivia and cynical talk radio which spreads inaccuracies and falsehoods. The song uses metaphors such as \\"vultures,\\" \\"weeds,\\" \\"pollution\\" and \\"industrial waste\\" to drive home the point of gossip's effects. The theme was a personal one to Harrison, as he had felt victimized by gossip and by the media attention he received as an ex-Beatle, which inhibited his ability to live a normal life. This point is driven home by the line \\"You wonder why I don't hang out much/I wonder how you can't see.\\" \\"Devil's Radio\\" begins with a repeated recitation of the word \\"Gossip\\" before launching in the verses describing the evils of gossip. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter wrote that the music was inspired by the Eurythmics, making it one of the few songs in which Harrison was influenced by contemporary musical trends. Harrison biographer Simon Leng described the music accompaniment as Harrison's most aggressive since \\"Wah-Wah\\" in 1971 and described the style of the music as rockabilly. Leng compared the opening of \\"Devil's Radio\\" to songs of Chuck Berry and particularly praised Harrison's vocal and the counterpoint provided by Eric Clapton, who played guitar on the song along with Harrison. The other musicians who performed on the song were Elton John on piano, Jeff Lynne on bass guitar and keyboards, Ringo Starr on drums and Ray Cooper on percussion. Reception Although not released commercially as a single, \\"Devil's Radio\\" reached #4 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. Inglis described the song as \\"a fiery dose of contemporary rock 'n' roll at its most compelling\\" and saw it as an inspiration for some of the songs on Tom Petty's Full Moon Fever and Into the Great Wide Open which, like \\"Devil's Radio,\\" were produced by Lynne. Mat Snow praised Lynne's production for bringing out the \\"wry, loving humor of George's singing,\\" even though Harrison's voice often struggles with up‚Äìtempo songs like this. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it one of the \\"best moments\\" on Cloud Nine. Madinger and Easter reacted similarly. Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley called it one of Cloud Nines \\"most instantly accessible tracks\\" and expressed surprise that it wasn't released as a commercial single, stating that its honky tonk piano and Beatle-like backing vocals made it a natural album-oriented rock radio track. Copley News reviewer Divina Infusino described the song as \\"biting commentary.\\" Santa Cruz Sentinel critic Paul Wagner considered the song to be \\"among the best two-guitar rock ever recorded.\\" A live version of \\"Devil's Radio\\" was included on Harrison's live album Live in Japan in 1992. This version was recorded during Harrison's 1991 Japanese tour with Clapton.

Written by Daniel Nocke, the film is about a middle-aged woman coming to terms with her son's sexual awakening and who ends up involved in some extramarital exploration of her own. The film was presented at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, and the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Miriam Franz (Martina Gedeck) has just turned forty and is starting a seaside vacation with her husband Andr√© (Peter Davor) and fifteen- year-old son Nils (Lucas Kotaranin) on the Schlei, a narrow inlet of the Baltic Sea in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. Andr√© has given Niels permission to bring his twelve-year-old girlfriend Livia (Svea Lohde) along for the trip. Miriam is concerned they may take their relationship to a physical level, but Andr√© seems unconcerned. One day, Nils and Livia go sailing, but Nils returns alone saying that Livia is still sailing with a man they met, Bill Ginger (Robert Seeliger), an American of German heritage. Bill brings Livia home and seems quite taken with her, and vice versa. Miriam is concerned by Bill's flirtation with the underage girl, finding it \\"a little weird\\"; Andr√© is unimpressed with Bill's fawning compliments. Soon Livia is spending all her time with Bill, while Nils sits at home watching war documentaries. When Livia fails to come home one night, Miriam, feeling responsible for her summer guest, drives to Bill's home to confront them about their inappropriate behavior. When she arrives, Bill casually tells Miriam that Livia went for a walk after an argument. While they wait, Bill admits how much he's enjoyed his time and conversations with Livia, after his years in America where all talk is about \\"money and stupidity.\\" He assures Miriam that he knows \\"when to stop\\" with the young girl. When Livia finally returns, Miriam drives her home and learns that Livia was disappointed that they didn't have sex. The next day, Miriam, Andr√©, and Livia join Bill for a day of sailing; Miriam and Bill take the C55 catamaran, while Andr√© and Livia take the sailboat B√©n√©teou. During a break from sailing, Miriam expresses interest in Bill's sex life, and as they relax on a beach she starts to seduce him, but he resists her advances. The next day, while Nils and Livia are out sailing, Miriam drives to Bill's house and they have sex. Afterwards, they see Livia waiting downstairs‚Äîapparently having heard their lovemaking. In the coming days, the family spends time at a fair and visits the Landesmuseum at the Gottorf Castle to visit the bog people exhibit. The relationship between Andr√© and Nils continues to grow strained. Mariam returns to Bill's house and they have sex again. Afterwards, Bill breaks off their relationship, saying he is in love with Livia. The next day, Miriam and Livia are out sailing when Livia is struck in the head by the main sail boom. Livia says she is okay, and they continue sailing. Miriam informs Livia she can no longer see Bill. When Livia says she's tired and asks to turn back, Miriam dismisses her, thinking she just wants to meet Bill. Later, Livia says she feels sick and collapses, hitting her head again. Miriam returns to shore and brings Livia to the hospital, where she dies. At home, Nils asks his father why he lied about the timing of the incident, noting if Miriam had turned back earlier, Livia would still be alive. After Nils leaves, Miriam tells Andr√© that their son is right‚Äîthat when Livia was initially struck, they were still fairly close to shore. That night, Miriam packs her things and Andr√© drops her off at Bill's house. Initially, Bill does not want to see her, but later they talk about Livia. After Miriam confesses there is no one she'd rather be with, they have sex. A few years later, Miriam and Bill, who are now a couple, visit with Livia's mother and her new suitor in Germany. Miriam and Bill left Germany in 2004 and have been living in the United States and traveling. Livia's mother reads them a letter her daughter wrote to a friend in August 2004. In the letter, Livia mentions how Miriam and her husband do not belong together, and she thinks Miriam and Bill would make a good match. She thinks she can help bring them together, to be \\"the happiest couple in the world.\\" Livia's mother asks them if they are now indeed happy, and Miriam says, \\"Yes, we're very happy.\\" Cast * Martina Gedeck as Miriam Franz * Robert Seeliger as Bill Ginger * Svea Lohde as Livia * Peter Davor as Andr√© * Lucas Kotaranin as Nils * Nicole Marischka as Grietje * G√°bor Altorjay as Daniel * Michael Benthin as Arzt Production =Filming locations= * Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany * Schlei, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany Reception =Critical response= Upon its release, Summer '04 received generally positive reviews in the United States and Europe. In his review in The New York Times, Matt Zoller Seitz wrote, \\"Mr. Krohmer's film is distinguished by very long takes, ominous cutaways to undulating river reeds, near-somnambulist underplaying by a first-rate cast and nail-on-the-head dialogue about materialism, hypocrisy, morality and mortality.\\" In his review in the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, \\"Director Krohmer creates a fine sense of erotic tension, and actress Gedeck provides more than enough emotional resonance. This is one tricky film, but it stays with you nevertheless.\\" Turnan concluded: In her review in The Village Voice, Michelle Orange wrote, \\"Elements of L'Avventura, Swimming Pool, and even A Place in the Sun materialize in the film's sophisticated layering of theme and counter-theme, and Gedeck in particular successfully invests her lightly defiant sensuality in this thorough and thoroughly engaging investigation of age (and entitlement) before beauty.\\" In his review in Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir applauded Martina Gedeck's \\"tremendous\\" performance and called the film a \\"well-crafted and deceptively leisurely film, with a heart of ice.\\" In his review in the New York Observer, Andrew Sarris called Summer '04 a \\"marvelous German film\\" with a \\"warmly stirring romantic maelstrom of five multigenerational libidos let loose at a lakeside vacation site.\\" Sarris concluded: In his review in Slant Magazine, Ed Gonzalez gave the film three of four stars and wrote that the film \\"exudes the fleeting quality of a summer breeze, exploring with unpretentious candor‚Äîand very little skin‚Äîhow a young girl's sexual agency rebukes an older generation's notions of right and wrong.\\" The film received an 80% positive rating from top film critics based on 20 reviews. =Box office= Summer '04 did not do well at the box office, earning only $632,017 in total worldwide gross sales. In the United States, the film was released in only two theaters, generating $20,474 in gross domestic revenue.

Description Julodimorpha bakewelli can reach a length of over . These large brown buprestids have an elongate and almost cylindrical body. The head is almost hidden when the beetle is viewed from above. Pronotum is dark brown and quite wide at the base. Elytra are brown, wider than pronotum and densely striatopunctated. Adults are diurnal and herbivore. They are reported to breed in roots and trunks of Eucalyptus species (Myrtaceae). Larvae are root-feeder. Both larvae and adults are present on flowers of Acacia calamifolia (Mimosaceae). Observations on mating behaviour The males of this species have the habit to aggregate on and attempting to copulate with discarded brown \\"stubbies\\" (a type of beer bottles). The males are apparently attracted by the refraction of light produced by the glass bumps of the bottles, resembling giant females with a very similar colour and surface. Consequently to this behaviour the species is actually threatened. Prof. Darryl Gwynne, from the Toronto University, and David Rentz have achieved the Ig Nobel Prize for their studies on Julodimorpha species behaviour. This behavior is often given as an example of a Supernormal stimulus. Distribution This species can be found in the arid and semi- arid areas of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.

Its three areas of activity are energy, the metal industry, and property development. The majority of the group's shares are owned by Estonian businessman Heiti H√§√§l. History The first company of the group, trailer manufacturer AS Bestnet, was established in 1990. The fuel retail company fuel retailer AS Alexela Oil was established in 1993. In 2002, a petroleum product terminal was opened in Paldiski, Estonia, and in 2007 in Sillam√§e, Estonia. In March 2006, Alexela Oil purchased from YX Energi the Uno-X chain in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

She also planned to improve engagement with politicians and to make the RIBA headquarters a 'cooler' place, including plans to open a new office in East London. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/107) with Angela Brady in 2013-14 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.National Life Stories, 'Brady, Angela (1 of 10) National Life Stories Collection: Architects' Lives', The British Library Board, 2014. Retrieved 10 April 2018 Brady's architectural firm was involved in the design for the new School of Architecture and Interior Design, in London. The award- winning design also incorporates a 2-storey Victorian warehouse to the rear and a new building at the front. The building was conceived as 'raw' construction with all materials left in their natural state. Brady Mallalieu was involved in the refurbishing of the Sacred Heart Church, Kilburn, Lodon, initially constructed in 1878 by Edward Welby Pugin. Brady was involved in creating a new lighting scheme that removed the visual clutter associated with modern lighting technologies. Suspended light fittings with the main body of the church were designed as contemporary 'coronas' a lighting arrangement typical in a Victorian church. Additionally, extensive repairs to the exterior of the church, including specialist repairs to stop tracery and leaded glass, were performed. Brady's architectural firm is also well known for creating The Barra Park Open Air Theatre in Hayes London. This theatre is an open-air venue for music, theatre and dance. The local community raised the money for the new structure and the building materials were carefully chosen to be robust and durable, but also complementing the natural park setting. The structure has a sculpture quality that allows it to play an important role in the community, even during the seasons where performances can not be completed. In 2004, Brady's firm finished construction on the St. Catherine's Foyer and Sports Centre in Dublin Ireland. This Foyer was Ireland's first Foyer centre and consists of a 48-bed Foyer housing and training project. In 2009, Brady's architectural firm completed Phoenix Heights in London. Located on Mistaker Road, this high density project consists of 199 mixed tenure homes with integral community areas. Community space played an important role in the design of the building and the structure has a rooftop sports pitch. BMA's Most recent building \\"Brickworks\\" Community Centre and housing project for Islington Council won RIAI Award 2019. Awards In 2012, Brady was awarded the Women of Outstanding Achievement Award For Leadership and Inspiration. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 2015 and in 2017 she was awarded the Irish President's Distinguished Services Award for architecture design.

The architectural historian John Newman, in his Gwent/Monmouthshire volume of The Buildings of Wales series described the court as \\"the most impressive and richly decorated house of around 1600 in Monmouthshire\\". The origins of the house are medieval, with a traditional date of construction of 1471. The building was given its present appearance by a substantial enlargement and re-casing of circa 1600 by Rhys Morgan, of the family of the original owners. In the very early 17th century it was owned briefly by Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester. In 1627 it was purchased by Nicholas Arnold and was further extended by him and by his heir John. Nicholas Arnold was a noted horse-breeder as well as Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire and was responsible for the construction of the Stable Block at Llanvihangel. His son was a notorious anti-Papist and Llanvihangel became a centre of the campaign against Monmouthshire recusants. The court had a number of owners in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, including the Earls of Oxford and Earls Mortimer. It remains a private house that is occasionally opened to the public and is a Grade I listed building. The stable block has its own Grade I listing, and the garden house, originally one of two on the site of a former walled garden, is listed Grade II*. History The traditional construction date of the court is 1471 but little remains of this original building. In the mid-16th century the Morgan family began a substantial rebuilding which incorporated certain of the earlier medieval elements. A further rebuilding took place at the end of the 16th or the start of the 17th centuries, when the house was again extended to form a substantial building on an H-plan. It is not certain which elements of this reconstruction were undertaken by the Morgans, or by the Arnolds, who purchased the court in 1627. Nicholas Arnold was member of parliament for Monmouthshire, and Sheriff for the county in 1633. He was also a significant breeder of horses and undertook the construction of the stable block at Llanfihangel soon after his purchase of the estate. Nicholas was succeeded by his son John, also an MP and a staunch Protestant. His religious views and marked intolerance of Catholics, in a county with a strong recusant tradition, made him a controversial figure. Arnold led the persecution of Catholics within Monmouthshire and was responsible for the hunting, trial and execution of a number of Catholic priests. An example was the Jesuit Father David Lewis who was caught by Arnold at St Michael's Church, Llantarnam, held at Llanvihangel, and subsequently executed at Usk in 1679. Following the death of Arnold's son, without issue, his daughters sold the estate to Edward Harley in 1722. His great-nephew, the 5th Earl of Oxford sold Llanvihangel Court in 1801 to Hugh Powell, treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. It then descended to the Honourable William Powell Rodney who lived at the court until his death in 1878. His grandson sold the house in 1903 to Mr. Atwood Matthews whose widow lived there until 1924. It was then bought by Edward Osborne Bennett, who was High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1936. On his death in 1945 the house was purchased by Colonel and Mrs H S P Hopkinson, a direct descendant of the Edward Somerset who owned it in 1608. His family continue to own the court and it is occasionally opened to the public. Architecture and description The house has a \\"complicated building history\\". The construction is largely of Old Red Sandstone rubble. The north front is of two storeys and six bays, and is from the Morgan extension of 1599, and later made more symmetrical by Nicholas and John Arnold in the mid and late 17th century. Further work continued as late as the 20th century; Mrs Matthews adding two huge bay windows to the east front and a \\"strange Egyptian-style room\\" to the south in 1905. These were removed by Mr Bennett, owner from 1925‚Äì45, who worked to restore the original Tudor appearance of the house. The interior contains plaster ceilings, screens, fireplaces, doorcases and a \\"magnificent\\" staircase\\" of very high quality, some from the 17th century and some from later re-modelling. The Monmouthshire author and artist, Fred Hando, visited the house in the early 1950s and described it is his book Journeys in Gwent. Hando recorded the \\"seventeenth century decorated plaster work ceiling\\" in the great hall, and the fire-back, dated 1694, which had previously formed a bridge over a nearby stream. John Newman records the view of the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales who suggests that some of the plaster ceilings, long considered to be Jacobean, may in fact be careful re- modellings of the early 20th century by the architectural partnership of Bodley and Garner, who were undertaking contemporaneous remodelling at Powis Castle. Cadw also notes this uncertainty as to the actual dates for the ceilings, recording that \\"all the decorative plaster ceilings are of a character and would either be 17th century or Victorian reproduction(s)\\". The staircase rises in an extension of the late 17th century by John Arnold. It is variously described as of \\"yew\\" (by Coflein), or of \\"oak\\" (by Cadw). On the turn are two early 20th century stained glass windows, depicting Elizabeth I and Charles I and his family, both of whom are traditionally supposed to have visited the court. The stair leads to the former great chamber. Above this is a long room, stretching the whole of the entrance front and which Cadw suggests may have been a long gallery of the Arnold's time. The court is a Grade I listed building. Garden and estate The Stable block The Garden House The grounds and outbuildings are also of note. Nicholas Arnold laid out the gardens to the court in the mid-17th century. An oil painting in the hall shows the results. The plan is axial, the court at the centre, surrounded by terraces, and with two long avenues of trees, pines to the north and sweet chesnuts to the south. The gardening writer Helena Attlee notes Arnold's intention to \\"broadcast wealth, power and permanence\\". Writing in 1953, C.J.O. Evans noted that the \\"Scots pine are 200 years old, and many of them are now nearly dead\\". The Stable Block is \\"a great rarity dating from 1630‚Äì40 and largely unaltered\\". It is a Grade I listed building in its own right. Near the lake there is a small brick summerhouse, also called the Guardhouse or Garden House, which was originally one of a pair completing a walled enclosure around the court. Attlee suggests there may have been three such structures, although the third may have been a dovecote. The Garden House has its own Grade II* listed designation. Other buildings in the courtyard complex and gardens with their own Grade II listings include the barn attached to the stables, the cider house, the coach house, the garden walls, terraces and gate piers and the walled garden.

In 1957, he founded the newspaper Kyemon, which quickly became the most popular in Burma. In 2000, he was named one of the International Press Institute's 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past half-century. Work with Kyemon U Thaung was born \\"Aung Bala\\" in Nyaung Oo township, Mandalay Division, to Thar Phan and Daw Oak. He began his literary career with humor writing and plays, entering journalism in 1947 with the Yangon-based newspaper The Burma Times. Within four years, at the age of 25, he had become the newspaper's editor-in- chief. In 1957, he founded his own independent daily, which he titled Kyemon (English: \\"The Mirror\\"). The paper was an immediate success, and its circulation rose to 55,000 over the next seven years, more than twice the circulation of its next closest competitor. The following year, following a split in Prime Minister U Nu's Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, General Ne Win was given control of a two-year caretaker government. The military government immediately began to restrict press freedoms, imprisoning journalists and dissidents. Kyemon was briefly confiscated by the authorities, but returned to U Thaung's control after U Nu's 1960 return to power. Ne Win took control again, however, in a 1962 coup d'√©tat. For the next two years, Kyemon continued to publish \\"open criticism\\" of the military rule of Ne Win's new party, the Burma Socialist Programme Party. In 1964, U Thaung, along with three other editors, was arrested for his writing and imprisoned without charge. Kyemon was nationalized on 1 September 1964, followed by several other papers, marking the end of a free Burmese press for more than fifty years. Post-release U Thaung was pardoned in 1967. He then began work at the Ministry of Information and again permitted to write columns; however, his license was revoked when his popular column again became too critical of the government. In 1977, he was granted permission to travel to the US, where he began work for The Missiourian, based in Washington, Missouri. While in the US, he continued to criticize Burmese military rule, most notably in a Reader's Digest article describing his three years of imprisonment. In retaliation, the Ne Win government revoked his passport, leaving him unable to travel or return home. The American government later granted him political asylum. U Thaung continued to condemn military rule in Burma through essays and books for the next three decades. He wrote thirty books in his lifetime, two of which-- General Ne Win and His Executioners (1990) and A Journalist, a General and an Army in Burma (1995)--became bestsellers. He also became a consultant for Radio Free Asia and served as editor in chief of the New Era Journal, an independent Burmese news publication printed in Thailand and illegally smuggled into Burma. On 3 April 2008, U Thaung died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, having never returned to Burma. He had worked in journalism for over sixty years, leading Democratic Voice of Burma to dub him \\"Burma's longest-serving journalist\\". Personal life U Thaung was married to Tin Tin Win, with whom he had five children, now living in the US.

The small and undated oil-on-canvas painting featuring a skeleton and cigarette is part of the permanent collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. It was most likely painted in the winter of 1885-86 as a satirical comment on conservative academic practices. Before it was common to use live humans as models, the academic routine included the study of skeletons to develop an understanding of human anatomy. Van Gogh was in Antwerp, Belgium at that time attending classes at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, which he later said were boring and taught him nothing. Van Gogh included skeletons in another work from his Antwerp period, a sketch of a \\"Hanging skeleton and cat\\". In 1887‚Äì88, van Gogh painted two more paintings with skulls, the only other works of his (besides a drawing from the same period) to use skulls as a motif. The work measures . It is considered a vanitas or memento mori, at a time when Van Gogh himself was in poor health. It may be influenced by works of Hercules Segers, a 17th-century Dutch artist, or of F√©licien Rops, a Belgian contemporary of Van Gogh. Although often interpreted as a criticism of smoking, Van Gogh was a keen smoker himself, and continued to smoke until his death in 1890. In 2008, the painting was used by graphic designer Chip Kidd on the first edition cover for When You Are Engulfed in Flames, a collection of essays written by David Sedaris. Sedaris is said to have been \\"fascinated with the image\\" after seeing it on a postcard during a trip to Amsterdam.

She moved to Canada and joined the Ontario Association of Architects, becoming involved in the preservation of historic buildings in Kingston, Ontario. Inglis was also a member of Royal Institute of British Architects (1953) and Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (1985). She was a partner in Inglis and Downey Architects, Inc. She made a strong name for herself by proving to clients that even as a woman she was able to solve complex issues. This increased her creditability within the architectural field.  Life and career  Inglis was raised as a child in Milan, Italy, where she became interested in architecture . Illness forced her to stay in her room, which helped her find her passion for drawing and constructing 3-D miniature buildings from paper . At age 12, her parents sent her to England (in order to protect her from the Nazis), and she attended a British boarding school . Eventually she would go on to be an apprentice, at the age of 18, in Cheltenham before attending the University of Edinburgh for architecture . Inglis received a traveling scholarship, allowing her to study post-war architecture in Europe and North America . Her interest in landscape design encouraged her to gain a certificate from University College London, England in 1957 for this field . After moving to Kingston, Ontario, architect Wilfred Sorensen provided her with practical training between 1962 and 1963 . In 1953, she married Edinburgh James Inglis (psychologist), lasting 45 years . In London, she started her own architectural firm and practiced there for six years . In 1959, Inglis and her husband moved to Kingston, Ontario after James received a teaching job opportunity from Queen's University at Kingston. Her an her husband had two daughters, Jane and Kate . She produced work from home, while also having to care for her two daughters, until 1984 . After this point, she created a firm alongside architect Bruce Downey called Inglis & Downey Architects, who was a previous Carleton University graduate . The two became knowledgeable in redesigning group homes to create barrier-free accessible areas . There, she found inspiration in the stone architecture of the city and decided to explore building preservation by utilizing the stone style of Kingston in her own designs, paying homage . She also worked to redesign heritage buildings for contemporary use and conservation . Some of her notable projects include the Kingston Public Library, Chez Piggy restaurant, the Kingston Brew Pub and the Wolfe Island ferry terminal . Inglis also gained connections with Margaret Angus, who was a historian and author . Together, they worked to give Kingston heritage buildings a voice when they were being threatened with demolition . Instead, they were advocating for preservation which went against the typical practice occurring within the city . This caused the city to create \\"The City of Kingston Act, 1970\\", recognizing the heritage value of buildings in Kingston . Overall, the quote \\"my pleasure is in seeing people enjoying places I have helped to make\\" by Inglis describes her main focus when designing . Inglis was known by the community as a social activist who fought for children and homeless rights . With her passion for Kingston's social welfare, a shelter was renamed Lily's Place in 2012 . The address of this family-oriented shelter is 333 Kingscourt Ave, Kingston, Ontario . Inglis passed away from cancer on 11 January 2010 .  Projects  This is an incomplete list of projects.

Skis before the SCX had almost always used a shape that was slightly curved inward on the sides, typically by compared to a straight line running from tip to tail. The SCX was designed with over \\"sidecut\\", producing a wasp-waisted ski unlike anything on the market. The SCX proved to dramatically improve turn performance and made it much easier to perform the efficient carve turn. This led to higher speeds in giant slalom, and the ski started winning race after race when it was introduced. It also made skiing easier in general, and revolutionized ski schools, especially in the US where the design first caught on. By 1996 every major ski company was racing to introduce similar designs, and traditional designs were being sold off for pennies on the dollar. As the first successful \\"shaped\\" or \\"parabolic\\" ski, the SCX is considered one of the most important advances in the history of the sport. Early ski designs The first true downhill skis, made in Telemark, Norway by Sondre Norheim, were handmade from single pieces of hardwood and featured a relatively modest sidecut of about 4 to 5 mm. Alpine ski development after this seminal introduction proceeded in a series of stepwise improvements; laminate woods, metal edges, metal laminates (see the article on the Head Standard) and finally the fibreglass torsion box design were introduced over a period of 100 years. Throughout, little engineering effort had been spent on considering the ski shape, as other issues like torsional stiffness and \\"chattering\\" were problems that needed to be solved. Skis of the 1970s were largely identical in shape to those of the 1800s. Skis with narrower waist profiles had been experimented with, but had never become widely used. In 1939, Dick Durrance ordered a custom ski from Thor Groswold's factory in Denver with a 7 mm sidecut, and this became a new standard for slalom skis. During the winter of 1948/49, Jerry Hiatt and Thor's son Jerry decided to experiment with even bigger sidecuts. Taking a pair of the company's standard hickory Rocket skis, they cut away wood until they produced a sidecut. When they tried them out, they found they turned quite easily in a series of rounded turns. Ironically, this was considered poor form in the era of the stem Christie, where good form was a series of sharp J-shaped turns. The two abandoned the design, speculating that they ended up as firewood. In any event, wooden skis of this era did not offer much torsional stiffness; when rolled on-edge by the skier's boots, the tips and tails of the ski would tend to twist in the opposite direction in order to lay flatter on the snow. This reduced the amount of performance the sidecut would normally add. Hiatt and Groswold's experiment required such a deep sidecut that the waist had little vertical stiffness, another problem for the design. Snowboards arrive A radical change in design did not occur until the mid-1970s introduction of the first modern snowboards. With no previous designs to set the mould, snowboard designers had to experiment to find the right layout. The 1975 Burton Backhill had a sidecut, giving the board a very short turning radius. The Backhill was extremely low-tech in comparison to contemporary ski designs, consisting largely of a sheet of plywood. A contemporary ski's torsion box design greatly improved torsional stiffness and would allow even greater sidecut to be effective. But in spite of the snowboard demonstrating that modern skis could carry much wider sidecuts, and that such a sidecut resulted in excellent turn performance, little came of this development. The snowboard market was ignored by the major ski companies through the 1970s and 80s.Jeffrey Covell and Frederick Ingram, \\"The Burton Corporation\\", Gale Directory of Company Histories Experiments with slightly greater sidecut on skis did appear during this period, including the Head Yahoo and especially the Atomic Powder Plus. Further developments followed due to changes in competitive giant slalom, as the gates were moved further apart and resulted in much more turning. K2 responded with the GS Race with a sidecut, and several similar designs followed. In spite of reports that these skis were easier to turn, they were considered specialty items and the designs offered only to the race and performance markets. One particularly notable experiment was made at Olin. In 1984, one of the Olin executives asked ski designer Frank Meatto if it were possible to make a beginners ski that would make skiing easier to learn. Meatto and co-designer Ed Pilpel decided to experiment with a radical sidecut as a way of improving turns. They designed a ski with a sidecut, but it had tips that were wide and they wouldn't fit into their presses. They solved this by cutting the ski in half longitudinally, leaving the curve only on the inside edge, which powers the turn. The ski was so narrow underfoot that additional platforms had to be added to mount the bindings. The result was effectively one-half of the parabolic designs that would follow. The company produced 150 pairs to demonstrate at the SIA trade show in 1986, but no one purchased the odd-looking asymmetrical \\"Albert\\" design. Franko and ≈†kofic Jurij Franko graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1983 with a degree in engineering and in 1985 and took a position at Elan in 1987. In 1988 Franko took up the idea of experimenting with deeper sidecuts and started the \\"Sidecut Extreme\\" project to test it. He was joined by Pavel ≈†kofic, who calculated the stress loading on a ski with a wasp- waisted layout. Previous ski designs had so little sidecut that they could be treated with calculations based on a constant width. Their first prototype was long and has been lost. The second one was long, a typical length for men's skis in this era, and is still skiable. By 1991 these experiments had clearly suggested a new design that was wide at the tip, in the waist, and at the tail. This produced a sidecut of , three times the conventional 7 mm sidecut of the average race ski, and over double that of even the most radical designs in use. The ski was so prone to turning that racers did not have to angle their legs as much in order to generate the same turn, allowing them to stand more upright with less bend in the knee, and thereby apply much more force to the edges. The new design was an immediate hit on the local race market; in its first outing with the ski, the Elan team took the top eight of ten places. SCX emerges In 1991, Elan used their research examples to produce a new commercial ski, the SCX. The company sold it across Europe, but found it difficult to break into a market dominated by the large players, Salomon and Rossignol. In the spring of 1993, a number of pre-production SCX skis were sent to instructors in the US for practical experimentation. They invariably reported dramatic results, with intermediate skiers able to produce carving turns easily, even in poor conditions that experts would normally find difficult. Realizing they had a winning design, the Elan team started designing a series aimed at the training market, including a 163 cm long design for the instructors, and a 143 cm long version for students and junior racers. This was much shorter than most skis of the era, further differentiating them from other skis on the market. These were being demonstrated across Europe and the US during December 1993. The change in length was not accidental. With most of the mass distributed at the ends of the skis, the rotational inertia was considerably higher and the skis were difficult to rotate under the foot. Additionally, as was discovered by Groswold and Hiatt half a century earlier, with so much force being applied at the end of the skis, they had to be much stronger under the waist. The solution was simply to make the ski considerably shorter, reducing the moment arm and counteracting these effects. Skis quickly evolved to shorter lengths; 190 to 210 cm were typical lengths for men's skis prior to the parabolics, and generally 160 to 170 cm after. Other companies were aware of the SCX, and several had already been working on a radical sidecut designs of their own. In particular, Atomic had been developing a similar concept known as the S-Ski, and had shown it at US trade shows during the winter of 1993. However, the market was already in the midst of a major change to the \\"cap ski\\" construction method, sparked off by the Salomon S9000 in 1990. All of the major manufacturers were introducing cap ski designs of their own, and had little interest in another radical change at the same time. This was not the only problem; the ideal design featured tips and tails that wouldn't fit in conventional presses, and the presses that were wide enough were busy producing snowboards. The concept was not only ignored, but actively dismissed as a fad or gimmick. Elan, however, had introduced a cap ski of their own shortly after the S9000. They built the SCX on these lines, thereby combining all of the latest features in a single ski. This left Elan in the undisputed lead introducing the new shape. When describing the turns the SCX produced, Franko used the term \\"parabolic\\". The term immediately caught on, and became so popular that every ski like it was soon called \\"a parabolic\\". Every mention of the term led back to the SCX, providing excellent visibility for the company. When it hit the stores during the winter of 1993, it was named \\"ski of the year\\" in the trade press. Parabolic revolution By 1994 a number of smaller companies had introduced parabolic skis of their own, including the Atomic S-Ski and similar Kneissl Ergo (which developed from Olin's earlier models). Fischer joined the fray with the 15 mm sidecut Ice and there was a similar model from Head, the Cyber 24. The large conglomerates, Salomon, Rossignol and K2, continued to ignore it. K2 was the first among the major manufacturers to follow Elan's lead. In 1994 they designed a prototype with a 98 mm tip that would fit into their 100 mm presses. They planned on producing a range of skis based on this design, the Four, Three and Two. The Four was a race ski, and as is typical in the industry, was the first to be produced. When Bode Miller started winning races on the K2 Four in the 1996 Junior Championships, the other large companies took note. Yet the European companies continued to view it as a curiosity, an American fad. But when racers started buying them over any other design, these companies started frantic efforts to produce similar designs. In 1996, Salomon introduced the Axendo and Rossignol the Cut, their first shaped designs. For the 1995/6 season, the new designs accounted for only 3% of total sales. By the next year, with all the major players involved, they accounted for 50%. By 1997 every manufacturer had a variety of skis with differing sidecuts, and older designs were derisively dismissed as \\"skinny skis\\". These older designs clogged the discount racks, and top-of-the-line models from the previous year could now be purchased for $29.95. It became clear that skis should have always been shaped this way, and one designer later noted that \\"It turned out that everything we thought we knew for forty years was wrong.\\" By the 1997/98 season every ski company was producing parabolic designs, and only parabolic designs. In spite of fire-sale prices on older designs, parabolics accounted for 70% of all ski sales by 1999. Over time these would be known as carving skis, super-sidecuts, hourglass skis, and finally shaped skis. Modern designs tend to have less radical sidecut than the SCX, and lengths have increased somewhat as well, but the SCX remains revolutionary in its effects on design.

Well known for his unique style of body language and barefooted dancing with his songs. His contribution to Balochi music is greatly admired by most Baloch people. He introduced the traditional music style of Balochi folk songs all over Pakistan after migrating to Karachi, Pakistan. Early life He was born into an Iranian-Baloch family in Qasr-e Qand, Iran, a region in Nikshahr township in 1901 in the Iranian part of Balochistan, called Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran. First his father introduced him to Baloch musical instruments and taught him to sing. Then Master Mallarami formally taught him how to sing and he learned lute and harp from the musician Allahdad. Master Allahdad belonged to the Lashar region in Nikshar township. Faiz decided to move, with his wife and children, to the newly created country Pakistan at the time of independence of Pakistan in 1947. At that time, he was already 46 years old. In Pakistan, Master Khayr Mohamamd taught him Sindhi music. Although Faiz Baloch had lived his early life in Karachi where he had initially settled in Lyari Town area of Karachi that had a significant Balochi-speaking population. Initially he worked as a labourer during the day and he would entertain the local people with his singing in the evening at street corners and at local wedding events. His singing first became popular among the Baluchi-speaking people of Karachi. In the 1950s, Faiz started to record his songs at Radio Pakistan, Karachi and continued to record his songs in the 1960s also, yet mainstream popularity still eluded him until he got a chance to perform on television. He later moved on to Quetta, Balochistan where the establishment of the first Pakistani television station (PTV, Quetta) in 1974 compelled him to move there from Karachi. Faiz's performances included barefooted dancing while singing. So radio broadcasts of his music and singing could not capture the full potential of his performances. Most of his songs and music were upbeat. At Quetta, he then lived most of his remaining life and served the cause of Balochi folk music. Musical career He composed poems and songs in his mother tongue, Balochi. His works consist of hundreds of songs. He toured and performed in South Korea, Russia, Indonesia, France, United States, Al Jazeera, Lebanon and Spain. His most popular songs are: *Laila O' Laila (This song's performance on television (PTV) in a 1973 show first earned him nationwide popularity)Faiz Mohammad Baloch's Laila O' Laila song on YouTube Retrieved 1 July 2018 *Biya tara baran saila *Musqat e MehrukFaiz Mohammad Baloch's Muscat e Mehruk song on wichaar.com website Retrieved 1 July 2018 *Bag e Bulbula *Mai Zameen O' Asmaana *Mai-Sharona *Yeh Pakistan Hamara ( song in Urdu language)Qawwali music portal (includes Faiz Mohammad Baloch profile) on thewire.co.uk website published June 2015.

As a sophomore in 1932, he began the season as the Wolverines' starting fullback, but he sustained a fractured rib in late October 1932. The injury did not appear serious at first, but the rib snapped while Oliver was punting during practice on October 26, 1932. He was a teammate of Gerald Ford on Michigan's football teams from 1932 to 1934. While at Michigan, he was also the captain of the baseball team and was the fourth student at Michigan to win nine varsity letters in three major sports. (Bennie Oosterbaan and Harry Kipke also won nine letters in football, baseball, and basketball.) Oliver was also the freshman golf champion at Michigan. Culver Military Academy After graduating from Michigan in 1935, he returned to the Culver Military Academy where he worked for nearly 40 years. He was the head coach of the school's teams in football (1935‚Äì1941, 1946‚Äì1968), baseball (1935‚Äì1941, 1946‚Äì1961), and basketball (1935‚Äì1941, 1946‚Äì1961). He was a major in the United States Army during World War II, serving with the Second Engineer Amphibious Brigade in the Pacific Theater of Operations from July 1942 to 1946. After retiring as a head coach in 1968, he continued to serve as the academy's director of alumni affairs. Oliver compiled a career record of 152‚Äì90‚Äì13 as the head football coach at Culver Military Academy. His record as the academy's coach in other sports was 211‚Äì137 in basketball and 105‚Äì76 in baseball. In 1994, he was posthumously inducted into the Culver Military Academy Athletic Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class. The academy's football field is named Oliver Field in tribute to Oliver.

It is one of the oldest mining songs in existence. It was already popular, and had been for how long we do not know, when Joseph Ritson published it in his Northumbrian Garland in 1793. It is still a very popular piece by choirs throughout the North East of England.  Lyrics  There have been mine disasters as long as coal has been mined, going back long before medieval times. Some of these have been caused by gasses (the first reference to an explosion in a North East mine appears to have been in 1621), some by rock falls, and some by plain carelessness. From early times the miners had viewed the pit with suspicion, and it was part folk lore, part fright, and part plain superstition, that many of the disasters had been attributed to the de‚Äôil (the devil) or his henchmen who lived at the bottom of the shaft in every pit. This old north eastern song confirms the superstition. The song appears in many publications including Joseph Cawhall‚Äôs ‚ÄúA beuk o‚Äô Newcassel sangs‚Äù published in 1888: Recordings Thomas Allen from Songs of Northumbria ‚Äì volume II (reference number MWMCDSP87).

She was the mother of Robert, Count of Flanders, known as Robert of B√©thune after his mother. Life Matilda, also referred to as Mathilde or Mahaut, was born about 1230, the first child of Robert VII, Lord of the castle and town of B√©thune and Advocate of the Abbey of St. Vaast at Arras, who was a major landowner and one of the twelve peers of Flanders. Her mother was Elizabeth, widow of Nicholas I, Lord of Cond√©, and daughter of Arnold IV, last Lord of . Robert and Elizabeth had two further daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah.(French) =Countess= About the age of 16, Matilda was engaged to Guy of Dampierre, who was made co-ruler of Flanders by his widowed mother Margaret II, Countess of Flanders alongside her and his elder brother William III of Dampierre, who died in 1251. In recognition of this important match for his eldest daughter, Robert of B√©thune endowed her with the major part of his lands and titles. In October 1245, she still under age and unmarried, he made her heir to the ancient lands of his ancestors outside B√©thune, the in which he held power of life and death. The marriage contract was signed on 2 February 1246 and the wedding then took place in B√©thune. 0n 24 June 1248 Robert and Elizabeth wrote a letter to Guy and Matilda confirming that the two would inherit his lands and titles, which happened shortly after when news reached France of Robert's death. Matilda then became Lady of B√©thune, of Dendermonde, of Richebourg and of Warneton, as well as Advocatess of the Abbey of Saint Vaast at Arras. By marriage, Guy called himself Lord of these holdings and Advocate, which he was doing by October 1249. =Death and legacy= Matilda died on 8 November 1264 and was buried in a tomb of black marble in the Chapel of Saint Hubert within the abbey church of Flines-lez- Raches, her husband being placed beside her later.

She was born in Bruck/Mur, Austria in 1939. Plumb left Austria at the age of 20, and emigrated to Canada, where she settled in Toronto in 1959.  Education Helga Plumb studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Austria for one year before moving to Toronto, Canada. She completed her undergraduate degree in architecture at the University of Toronto in 1963 and remained there to receive her masters of architecture in Urban design in 1967. It was very uncommon for women in Ontario to be studying architecture during this time. Countries like Austria had a higher population of female students. Many women who left to study in Canada were often the only women in their class. Female architects such as Plumb have openly discussed the alienation that occurred studying as a woman in the Ontario classroom during the 1960s and 70s. Career After Plumb graduated from her master's program, she began to work for multiple firms. She began her career at Diamond and Clark where she was a project architect in Edmonton, Alberta. Here Plumb helped design the Edmonton Health Sciences Centre as well as a housing project and Amphitheatre in Calgary. Around this time, she also began working for Sasaki Dawson & DeMay as a design assistant in Watertown, Massachusetts. While with this company Plumb aided in the construction of the Barrington College Gymnasium and the Watertown University Library. Later she worked for Shore and Moffat as their production architect based in Toronto. Her projects were the General Arts Building at the University of Saskatoon and the Coinco Research Building in Burlington Ontario. While developing her skills and working her way up to larger projects, Plumb also began being involved in the academic side of her field. From 1981-82 she worked as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo. After that, she moved to the Technical University of Nova Scotia from 1985 to 1986 as a visiting professor. Through her teaching career, Plumb became very interested in how classrooms were used and what they did to benefit or distract students. How people interacted in her buildings became a constant concern for Plumb. She believed buildings should encourage social engagement instead of hinder it. As her career developed, she began to work at the Fairfield and Du Bois Partnership, where she met her soon-to-be husband, Macy Du Bois. After Fairfield left for retirement, Plumb was promoted to partner, and the company was renamed the Du Bois Plumb Partnership. Between the years of 1979-1993 Plumb and Du Bois created some of their most memorable work, one of these works being the Canadian Embassy in Beijing. This building took over ten years of planning to create; this was due to a number of bureaucratic circumstances that caused many problems for the architects and builders. The embassy located at 19 Dongzhimenwai Dajie, Caho Yang District in Beijing is one of 172 foreign representations in Beijing and one of 382 foreign representatives in China. Plumb enjoyed working alongside her husband and did so until her retirement in 2001. Plumb once stated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I would get jobs if clients didn‚Äôt know I had a male back-up.‚Äù It was not uncommon for people in Ontario to believe women needed a male-presence to make an impact in architecture. Female architects based out of Ontario commonly noted that they felt intimidated by the extremely male-dominated field. On the other hand, many female architects based out of Quebec said they did not and would often get offended by any suggestion that they needed to rely on their male co-workers to make it in the industry. = Architectural style = Plumb's style is known for uniting people inside a space. She enjoyed taking old architectural ideas and reconstructing them to fit modern life. She believed contemporary ideas were built from ideas of the past and not entirely new. She often focused on function, structure, and material in her buildings and believed these were the foundations for creating a remarkable design. However, she believed that function and structure were slightly more critical than material, and that material should be used as a way to support function and structure. She wanted her buildings to be backgrounds on which people could engage with one another. Her buildings never dominated a space but rather blended into their surroundings. While growing up, Plumb was heavily inspired by the old architecture of Austria. She noticed the way these buildings and streets made people act within them. Plumb took these ideas and applied them to a post-modern style. She liked the sophistication of the modern movement and its step away from ornamentation. Plumb once stated, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you have to attach things to architecture because you can utilize everything you have.‚Äù This idea is often portrayed in her designs. = Notable works = The Oakland Condominium is a large housing complex built in 1981, two years after becoming partners with Macy Du Bois. This building located on 315 Avenue Road and 20-40 Oakland's Ave Summer Hill, Toronto is made up of six floors and 65 different apartments. In this work Plumb wanted to create the idea of a city within a city, to do this she created an internal walkway through the building that is full of natural light. This way renters could come to this mini-city to engage with one another. All renters have access to a parking garage and visitor parking to encourage residents to bring guests. This building's architecture won Plumb the Habitation Space International Award of Excellence, the Canadian Architect Yearbook Award of Excellence, the O.A.A Toronto Life Design Award, the Canadian Architect Design Award and the Governor General‚Äôs Medal for Architecture. Plumb used the Scaramouche Restaurant in Toronto as another way to play with human interaction. Built-in 1979 this building is located at 1 Benevento Place in Toronto, Ontario. The foundation of the restaurant is created using a structural grid that controls but encourages the flow of traffic through the restaurant. Plumb designed this building to sit on a hillside, so diners could enjoy looking down onto the city while eating. At night the city lights create a romantic backdrop for the restaurant's French cuisine. The original owner that worked with Plumb continues to run the restaurant over 35 years later. The pair worked together to create an environment that matched the chef's contemporary French food. The restaurant's space is divided so that people can enjoy a casual dinner downstairs or fine dining upstairs. Reviews of this restaurant continue to praise Plumb's design, stating it creates the perfect atmosphere for relaxing. Another famous project from the Du Bois Plumb Partnership is the Tom Longboat Elementary School erected in 1978. This school is located at 37 Crow Trail in Scarborough Malvern and is named after the long distance runner and Onondaga Aboriginal, Tom Longboat. The school shows Plumb's famous postmodern style that contains a grid-like foundation similar to the Scaramouche Restaurant. The grid encourages children to play and learn with one another but also to remain organized. This building ended up winning the Scarborough Planning Board Urban Design Certificate of Merit and the OMRC Award of Merit. Plumb was often disappointed with the lack of resources and effort put into creating schools for children. She thought Canadian schools resembled jail too much and did not encourage learning. Helga Plumb often turned down requests for schools with no windows at all so that students would not be distracted. Once in an interview, Plumb stated, ‚Äúthere is this whole idea that children will be distracted outside which is incredible to me because there is so much to learn outside. To lock a kid up inside is unbelievable.‚Äù A specific moment that altered the way Plumb saw the classroom was when a butterfly fluttered through her window while teaching one day. She stated that all the students stopped their work and became completely engaged with the butterfly. After her attempt to redirect her students‚Äô attention failed, she gave up and spent the rest of her class talking about and watching the butterfly. Plumb realized the disconnect students have from nature in the classroom; schools do not reflect the minds of their students instead they try to control them. Plumb attempted to alter the classroom in very cost-effective ways. In some cases, she would slant rooves in order to allow more windows, or she would colour the walls. School boards kept pushing architects to harden schools so they would last a long time; however, Plumb noticed this caused them to resemble prison cells more and more. By increasing natural light and colour Plumb was attempting to bring softness and life back into the classroom. =Awards received from other projects= *Helga Plumb has received the Governor General's medal for architecture. *Her works have been included in publishings on energy efficient design. *Plumb received the O.M.R.C Award of Merit for the Grand River Cable Television. *Plumb was awarded the Low Energy Building Design Award of Excellence for the Government of Canada Office Building. *Plumb was awarded the Modern Healthcare/ AIA Design Award and the Nova Scotia Association of Architects Award for the Souris Hospital in Nova Scotia.

A church of ‚Äò‚ÄôOur Lady of the Consolation‚Äô‚Äô under the care of Augustinian Fathers was known near this site since the 15th century. At the time, it stood in the perilous neighborhoods outside the city walls. Construction of new defensive walls after the bombardment in 1684, forced the Augustinian monks to relocate, and they were authorized to build at the present site. Construction ran from 1684 till 1706. The dome was added in 1769 based on designs by Simone Cantoni. The adjacent monastery, never completed, became in the 19th century the site of a marketplace called the Mercato Orientale. In 1810, under Napoleonic rule, the Augustinians were dispossessed of the church, and by 1813, it became a parish church. The interior frescoes date to after 1875.

The virgin statue on the fa√ßade was moved here from the prior church. The organ was built by Giacomo Locatelli in 1880 and restored in 1975.

The total energy from Geothermal was 5,660 GWh in 2015. Italy is the sixth country by geothermal installed capacity.See Geothermal electricity. There are 33 active geothermal plants with a total capacity of 772 MW. All the plants are in Tuscany in the provinces of Grosseto, Pisa and Siena. The province of Pisa alone contributes for more than half of the national production. History In the 20th century, demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904 in Larderello, in the province of Pisa. It successfully lit four light bulbs.Tiwari, G. N.; Ghosal, M. K. Renewable Energy Resources: Basic Principles and Applications. Alpha Science Int'l Ltd., 2005 Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power plant was built there. Experimental generators were built in other countries in the 1920s, but Italy was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958. Current development On 30 May 2012, Enel Green Power announced the entry into service of the completely new geothermal power station Rancia 2 in the town of Radicondoli, in the province of Siena. The plant, which has a net installed capacity of 17 MW, will be able to generate about 150 GWh per year. The remaking of the central Rancia 2 falls within the group business plan 2012-2016, which envisages an investment package of around 500 million euros for development of geothermal plants in Tuscany. While the update of Rancia 1 and Le Prata (in the towns of Radicondoli (SI) and Castelnuovo di Val di Cecina (PI) respectively) are in progress, the total renovation will also start soon for the three geothermal plants located in the town of Piancastagnaio (SI). In 2013, Enel Green Power installed Gruppo Binario Bagnore3‚Äì1 MW. It was the first binary power plant in Italy.

The spillway creates usable waterfront land out of swamps and provides water retention by creating a backwater on the Ramapo River. The structure is listed as part of the Morris Canal on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places as well as the National Register of Historic Places. It is a sister structure to the Pompton dam which lies on the Pompton River.http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists/morris.pdf Technical description The Pequannoc Spillway is an early 20th-century concrete spillway over 270 feet wide, equal in girth to the Great Falls of Paterson located along the Pompton River a quarter-mile south of the Pompton dam and associated guard bank in Pequannock Township's Aquatic Park. The dam is a run-of-the-river spillway, which traverses the width of the river and at normal water elevation allows water to spill over its face. The structure is 22 feet tall, though possesses only an 8-inch over 3 foot grade on the upstream side.http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002006900 An associated guard house sits near the site in poor repair. History Like its sister structure the Pompton Dam, the Pequannoc Spillway was originally made entirely of timber. Constructed in the early 19th century the Pequannoc Spillway aided in navigation upriver along the Morris Canal during its almost 100 years of use. The structure was also part of a system to maintain water levels along portions of the Pompton River and Ramapo River which were at the time of their construction a part of the Morris Canal. The removal of the spillway was advocated against in the 1920s by C.C. Vermeule, Decommissioning Engineer for the Morris Canal and Dr. Henry B. K√ºmmel, General Manager of the Morris Canal and former New Jersey State Geologist. Both argued that removing the structure would reduce the surrounding lands to a series of \\"ill smelling mud flats,\\" noting this would devalue the adjacent lands. On Vermeule's suggestion, the State of New Jersey has upgraded the dam to a concrete structure providing the same operation as it had previously performed. Though the Pequannoc Spillway is silted on the upstream side such that the backwater it creates is no longer navigable, the spillway still sheds water over the entirety of this face creating a regional tourist attraction. Controversy An environmentalist group has advocated for the removal of the Pequannoc Spillway as well as the Pompton Dam, under the claims that this would reduce flooding for the upstream communities of Pompton Lakes and Riverdale. However, unlike the Pompton Dam, the Pequannoc Spillway still allows water-flow over the entirety of its girth so claims of flood hazard have gained little traction. Representatives of townships downstream of the dam believe that flooding to their communities would be increased due to increased in water flow and velocity with the removal of the spillway, while historic preservationists do not believe that the dam should be removed as it is a protected part of the Morris Canal listed in both the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.http://www.northjersey.com/news/101358359_History_blocks_possible_fix_for_flooding.html?page=all References Category:Run-of-the-river power stations Category:Morris Canal Category:Dams in New Jersey Category:1920s establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Pequannoc Spillway"},{"id":"34612725","text":"Song Jungil (Hangul: ÏÜ°Ï§ÄÍ∏∏, Hanja: ÂÆãÊµöÂêâ) (28 December 1606 ‚Äì 2 December 1672), also known by his nickname Dongchundang, was a Korean politician and neo- Confucian scholar of the Joseon Dynasty.

Bashara was a marketing executive and a resident of Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan. On January 25, 2012, she was found dead in the back seat of her abandoned Mercedes-Benz SUV in an alley in Detroit, Michigan. The cause of death was strangulation. Law enforcement officials named Bashara's husband, Bob Bashara, as a person of interest. Joe Gentz, a mentally impaired handyman, was arrested in March 2012 and charged with first degree murder after reportedly telling police that Bob Bashara had paid him $2,000 and an old Cadillac to murder his wife. Bob Bashara was arraigned on first degree murder charges in the death of his wife on May 1, 2013. Convicted, Bob Bashara was sentenced to life without parole by Wayne County Circuit Court Judge, Vonda Evans. Background At the time of her death, Jane E. Bashara was a 56-year-old senior marketing manager for KEMA Services, an energy consulting and testing company in Detroit. She was a native of Mt. Clemens, Michigan, and held bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration from Central Michigan University and the University of Detroit Mercy. She had two children and had served as a past president of the Grosse Pointe South High School Mother's Club. Bashara's husband, Bob Bashara, was a businessman who, at the time of the incident, owned and managed multiple rental properties. He was known as a philanthropist in Grosse Pointe and served for a time as the president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club. Bob Bashara is the son of George Bashara, a state appellate court judge and member of the Board of Governors at Wayne State University. The Basharas had been married for 26 years at the time of Jane Bashara's death. Bashara's death Jane Bashara was last seen by co-workers on the afternoon of January 24, 2012, after a meeting in downtown Detroit. Her husband filed a missing person report with the Grosse Pointe Park Police Department at approximately 11:30 p.m. On January 25, 2012, Bashara's body was discovered in the backseat of her Mercedes SUV, which was parked in an alley on the east side of Detroit. A tow truck driver discovered the body at 7:00 a.m. while patrolling for stolen vehicles. Police reported that Bashara had died from strangulation and that she had bruises and broken finger nails indicating she had \\"fought for her life.\\" Public reaction In light of the relative affluence, upscale reputation and overall lack of crime in the Grosse Pointe communities, local press reported every aspect of the killing at every turn for years and updates were published as front page headlines. On the evening of January 25, 2012, a candlelight vigil was held on the lawn at Grosse Pointe South High School, where Bashara had served as president of the Mother's Club. Bashara's minister led the gathering in prayer. Bashara's husband attended the vigil but did not speak to the gathering. Her funeral was held at Grosse Pointe Memorial Church and attracted hundreds of persons, including U.S. representative Hansen Clarke. Police investigation The investigation of Bashara's death was conducted jointly by the Grosse Pointe Park police and the Detroit Police Department. The Michigan State Police also participated in the investigation. On January 27, 2012, Grosse Pointe Park Police Chief David Hiller announced that Bob Bashara was \\"a person of interest\\" in the investigation. He said there were no other persons of interest at that time. Sources also reported at that time that Bob Bashara had taken and failed a lie detector test about his involvement in his wife's death. By January 31, 2012, investigators revealed that they believed Jane Bashara had been murdered in her home and then placed in her SUV. On February 1, 2012, it was reported that Joseph Gentz, a developmentally-disabled handyman who rented a property from Bob Bashara, had confessed to police that he helped dispose of Jane Bashara's body after she was murdered in her garage. Gentz reportedly told police that Bob Bashara had paid him $2,000 and an old Cadillac to murder his wife. On February 2, 2012, several publications reported that Bob Bashara \\"allegedly led a double life centering on the underground world of sadomasochism and sexual deviancy with women other than his wife.\\" It was also reported that he maintained a \\"sex dungeon\\" in the basement of the Hard Luck Lounge, located in a building owned by Bob Bashara on Mack Avenue in Grosse Pointe Park. On February 4, 2012, Bob Bashara commented that, \\"I did not kill my wife. I have nothing to do with this.\\" In February 2012, multiple media sources also reported on Bob Bashara's relationship with an alleged mistress, Rachel Rene Gillett, who had been employed in the office of alumni affairs at Wayne State University. Gillett was fired after leaving the office on the day Jane Bashara's body was discovered. Police raided Gillett's home in early March 2012. Police stated that Gillett was not a person of interest but left her home carrying seven cardboard boxes and an evidence bag. Bashara's attorney told the press that the Basharas had an \\"open marriage.\\" On March 3, 2012, Joe Gentz was arrested in Mount Clemens, Michigan. It was reported that Gentz had turned himself in on January 31, 2012, but that police had dismissed the confession made by Gentz, who had an IQ of 67, a score considered to be on the low end of scale by most intelligence tests. Following his arrest in early March, Gentz was charged with first-degree murder. On March 9, 2012, newspapers reported that the clothing worn by Jane Bashara at the time of her death was missing or had been destroyed. It was reported that the clothes, which were supposed to have been shipped to the Michigan State Police crime laboratory, had been picked up from the Wayne County medical examiner by a funeral home. On April 9, 2012, multiple sources reported that investigators continued to focus on Bob Bashara and a possible conspiracy and that criminal charges may be filed against him. \\"A source familiar with the investigation told the [Detroit] Free Press on June 24, 2012, that Bashara is accused of attempting to have someone murder Joseph Gentz. The former handyman told investigators he was hired by Bashara to kill his wife, Jane Bashara.\\" On December 18, 2014, Bob Bashara was found guilty of the murder of his wife Jane. On January 15, 2015, Bob Bashara was sentenced to life without parole by Wayne County Circuit Court Judge, Vonda Evans. In January, 2016, Gentz claimed he had committed perjury under pressure from Grosse Pointe Park police and that Bob Bashara was not involved in the murder of his wife. Gentz later recanted the affidavit, saying, \\"I never read what I sign.\\"} On August 18, 2020, Bob Bashara died in prison at the age of 62.

She was one of the few survivors of the Kovno Ghetto. Early life Nadezhda Dukstulskaite in the 1930sNadezhda Dukstulskaite was born in a Jewish family of musicians in what was then Dvinsk, part of the Russian Empire but is now the Latvian city of Daugavpils. Her talent manifested itself very early, during piano studies under her father, Martynas Dukstulskis, from age five, and from age seven at a private piano school in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, where the family moved in 1918. At age 12 she was admitted to the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, where she studied for six years under the influential piano teacher Leonid Kreutzer, graduating in 1928. Shortly after returning to Kaunas, her father died unexpectedly. To support the family, she took a job playing piano at a cinema. Career to 1941 From 1929 to 1941 her work in radio as well as concerts that she gave throughout Northern Europe (including many Lithuanian pieces in her repertoire) earned broad recognition for Lithuanian music at home and abroad.Kara≈°ka, Arvydas, \\"Nade≈æda Dukstulskaitƒó\\", in: Visuotinƒó lietuvi≈≥ enciklopedija (in Lithuanian), Vol. V, Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedij≈≥ leidybos institutas, 2004, p 191. During this period, she was part of a core group of musicians who worked at the state-run Kaunas Radio to develop Lithuania's first music programs and concert broadcasts for radio.Girdvainis, Juozas, \\"Radijo muzikinƒó programa 1926-1940 metais\\", in: Muzikos barai, 2006, No. 5-6 (in Lithuanian), Vilnius. Wartime With the invasion of Lithuania by Nazi Germany in 1941, she was detained in the Jewish ghetto in Kaunas (the Kovno Ghetto). She participated often in the concerts of the Kovno Ghetto Orchestra. She was held there until 1944, when she escaped from a work detail and then traveled to safety in Vilnius by foot. Post-war career Remaining after the end of World War II in Lithuania, which was annexed by the Soviet Union, she in 1944 resumed her work as a radio pianist, concert pianist and accompanist, touring throughout the republics of the Soviet Union.Kara≈°ka, Arvydas, \\"Nade≈æda Dukstulskaitƒó\\", in: Visuotinƒó lietuvi≈≥ enciklopedija (in Lithuanian), Vol. V, Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedij≈≥ leidybos institutas, 2004, p 191. Throughout this period, which continued until 1959, she made great personal efforts to help talented young musicians develop and mature. Later life Due to poor health, in 1959 she formally retired, but nonetheless remained active. In fact, from 1959 right up until her death in 1978, she played a major role in the creation and development of the A≈æuolukas choir and music school, helping many later accomplished musicians to take their first steps in music. Prominent Lithuanian musicians who have attributed their achievements in part to studies under Nadezhda Dukstulskaite include the opera singer Vladimiras Prudnikovas, violoncellist Valentinas Kapl≈´nas, pianists Robertas Bekionis and Leonidas Melnikas, and violinist Kornelija Kalinauskaitƒó.Rasa Mikalaj≈´nienƒó. \\"Concert Marks the Centenary of the Birth of Nadezhda Dukstulskaite\\" published in Lithuanian on the music news portal Choras.lt on 7 March 2012.

By 1893 she and her family, including her parents and fellow activist brother, Edward Page Gaston, were living in Harvey, Illinois, a Chicago suburb that prohibited the sale of alcohol through property deed restrictions. In 1895, Harvey officials issued a license for a tavern, and Lucy, then managing editor of the Harvey Citizen, led a protest by temperance advocates. Though unsuccessful in stopping the licensing of taverns in Harvey, the effort caught the attention of WCTU president Frances Willard, who recommended Gaston for the position of the national superintendent of the WCTU's Department of Christian Citizenship. This led to much greater activity within the WCTU, including editing of publications and appearing before the Illinois General Assembly on behalf of the organization. Anti-Cigarette League The WCTU viewed tobacco as a vice often associated with alcohol, though not necessarily with the same destructive capacity. Lucy Gaston viewed cigarettes as inherently evil. \\"I am no defender of tobacco in any form,\\" she said, \\"but the cigarette is in a class by itself.\\" She founded the Chicago Anti-Cigarette League in 1899, the first group of its kind in the United States. The group quickly went nationwide and beyond, establishing chapters around the United States and Canada, and renaming itself the Anti-Cigarette League of America, which claimed as many as 300,000 members. The Anti- Cigarette league had considerable success in the early years of the 20th century, and was instrumental in having cigarette bans passed in 12 states between 1899 and 1909. Gaston's method included publication of anti-cigarette materials, lobbying legislatures as well as personally appealing to people to stay away from cigarettes. She sponsored dances, sports leagues, and writing contests to promote the message. Her anti-smoking magazine The Boy often contained anecdotes of destructive behavior due to cigarette smoking. Gaston published magazines for children containing advice on avoiding smoking, and personally haunted less reputable neighborhoods of Chicago, calling down boys for smoking and inducing them to sign the \\"Clean Life Pledge.\\" Gaston also pressured merchants not to hire persons who smoked and admonished the Chicago Cubs baseball team over their use of tobacco. She promoted chewing the root of the gentian plant to reduce the craving for tobacco, and would regularly offer it to smokers trying to quit the habit. Gaston received support from a number of prominent organizations and persons. The Salvation Army and YMCA prominently opposed smoking. Montgomery Wards of Chicago and Wanamaker's Department Stores of Philadelphia refused to hire smokers, as did several railroads. Prominent men who supported the league included Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Stanford President David Starr Jordan, Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration Harvey Washington Wiley, and heavyweight boxing champion John L. Sullivan. Many of these (particularly Edison, Ford, and Sullivan) were not completely opposed to tobacco, just to the relatively new and foreign vice of cigarettes, as opposed to the more traditional cigar or chewing tobacco. Many of the league's loudest cheerleaders were cigar makers, who saw the profit in frightening cigarette smokers away from their new habit and back to their traditional smokes. Other unexpected backers of the League included North Carolina tobacco farmers, who resented the tactics of cigarette monopoly American Tobacco Company. Gaston's efforts to secure a smoking ban in her home state seemed to have reached a successful result in 1907, when the Illinois legislature passed a law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of cigarettes. The law was challenged by a Chicago tobacconist, and was overturned by a judge on a seeming technicality, noting that the title of the law was to \\"regulate\\" the sale of cigarettes when, in fact, it was a prohibition. The decision was upheld by the state Supreme Court, who also noted ambiguities in the law such that it could not be clear whether or not it prohibited pure tobacco cigarettes. When World War I started, cigarettes were considered a vital war material. Even the YMCA relented, participating in collecting and distributing cigarettes for soldiers. Gaston continued her opposition, even to the point of filing lawsuits to prevent the transhipment of cigarettes through Kansas, where they were illegal. The suits did not stop the shipments, but they resulted in loss of public esteem for Gaston, who was branded as unpatriotic. Post-war After the war, with alcohol prohibition in place, some felt (e.g. evangelist Billy Sunday) that tobacco prohibition would soon follow. This was not to be, as many men came back from the war with a cigarette smoking habit. Many women had also picked up the habit in wartime, reflected in an increase in cigarette consumption from 134 per person per year before the war to 330 after. Gaston felt that the organization she had created had lost its zeal, and began to openly criticize it, leading to her firing in 1920. In 1920, Gaston declared herself to be a candidate for President of the United States, on the platform of \\"clean morals, clean food and fearless law enforcement.\\" She self-deprecatingly pointed out her physical resemblance to Abe Lincoln, and contended that Republican candidate (and unabashed cigarette smoker) Warren G. Harding had \\"cigarette face\\", a malady that was not well defined but readily apparent to Gaston. She only filed in the Republican primary of South Dakota and dropped out long before the election, eventually attending the convention of the Prohibition Party and supporting William Jennings Bryan. After her separation from the payroll of the Anti-Cigarette League, she joined the Anti-Cigarette League of Kansas, but was fired after only two months, again for her unwillingness to compromise. After returning to Chicago, she formed a new organization, the National Anti-Cigarette League, but was fired again after six months for employing methods too extreme for the management of the organization. Afterwards, Gaston's personal financial situation became very strained, but she continued to verbally assault smokers and hand out press releases and gentian root. On the way home from an anti- cigarette rally in early 1924, she was struck by a streetcar. During treatment it was discovered that she had throat cancer, to which she succumbed on August 20. Numerous newspapers and even the trade publication The Tobacco Leaf noted her death in articles that were complimentary of her character. It was suggested that in her later years, Page was impoverished and lived on a diet of only graham crackers and milk.Engs, Ruth Clifford. (2003).

The Babes in the Wood Murders is a name that was used in the media to refer to a child murder case in which the bodies of three girls were found in Pennsylvania woodland. On November 24, 1934, John Clark and Clark Jardine found the bodies of Norma Sedgwick, 12, Dewilla Noakes, 10, and Cordelia Noakes, 8, under a blanket in the woods along Pennsylvania Route 233, Centerville Road. The girls had been suffocated, presumably by Elmo Noakes (father of Dewilla and Cordelia, and stepfather of Norma). The next day, Elmo shot and killed his 18-year-old niece Winifred Pierce, then himself with a .22 rifle. Events preceding the murders # 1934: Noakes is known to have a good reputation and a non-violent nature. He has a good job and lives in a good home well stocked with food. His niece, Winifred Pierce, works during the days in Noakes' home taking care of his children. # September 1934: Noakes acquired life insurance policies on his children and changed the beneficiary of his own life insurance from the children to his sister, Mrs. Pierce.Reading Eagle, Dec 2, 1934 # October 31, 1934: Noakes purchased a blue sedan, which was later found abandoned near the place of his suicide.The Evening Independent - Nov 30, 1934 # November 11/12, 1934: Noakes left home with Winifred Pierce (his niece) and the three girls, leaving behind two weeks' pay ($50) that was owed to him.The Evening Independent - Nov 30, 1934 # November, 1934: The family stopped at a diner in Philadelphia and shared a meal. # November, 1934: The girls' bodies were placed in the woods of Pine Grove Furnace Park near Carlisle, Pennsylvania. # November, 1934: Noakes and Pierce abandoned their blue sedan at McVeytown, Pennsylvania, and hitchhiked to Blair County. # November 23, 1934: Having failed to sell Noakes' spectacles, Pierce sold her coat.

Noakes was killed by a single gunshot wound to his head.Berkeley Daily Gazette - Dec 6, 1934 Identification of the bodies Discovery of the girls' bodies started a nationwide media frenzy resulting in many false leads as to the identities of the girls. Photographs of the children lying on a blanket were printed in newspapers across the country. Thousands came to view the bodies in hopes of identifying them. Death masks were made before burial to aid in the search for the girls' identities. Some clothing, towels, and children's books were found, but labels which may have contained their names had been torn off. Only the name \\"Norma\\" was found in one of the children's books. Noakes and Pierce were found over 100 miles away, near Altoona, Pennsylvania the day after discovery of the girls' bodies. Pierce had a gunshot wound to the heart and another to the head. Noakes had a single gunshot wound to the head. Using the description of the car, the physical features of the dead girls, and Elmo Noakes' fingerprints on military records, the bodies were identified.Gettysburg Times - Nov 15, 1968 Competing theories  There are many theories which purport to account for the tragedy. Early speculations included a cult killing due to a \\"sign\\" or mystic symbol found upon the head of Norma Sedgwick. But other experts believed that it was a head wound. Chief of Police E.E. York of Roseville, California, believed that Elmo Noakes did not kill the girls because, \\"His affection for the children was known all over the community.\\" He believed that automobile exhaust accidentally killed them. Then Noakes and Pierce, stricken with fear of being held responsible, committed suicide.The Deseret News - Dec 21, 1934 Others speculated that the family were being pursued by an armed gang.The Windsor Daily Star - Nov 23, 1935 Other theories are: * Noakes and Pierce fled so that they could be together. Noakes's inability to find work and the threat of starvation was too much for Noakes and Pierce, and the girls were suffocated to prevent further suffering. * Noakes was mentally ill and fleeing an imaginary evil. The children were killed to protect them from it.Gettysburg Times - Dec 28, 1934 * Difficulties within the family and rumors of their romantic relationship led to feelings of hopelessness.

She said that, \\"If it hadn't been for your family, he'd still be alive.\\" The Evening Record, Ellensburg, Washington, December 1st, 1934 She further claimed that she \\"warned Elmo not to have anything to do with her [Winifred Pierce] ...

Upon being sentenced, the two sisters screamed furiously and disrupted the court, requiring the judge to restore order. Robert Noakes (Elmo's brother) responded to the media by saying, \\"There's been trouble in the family for years, I guess that's why Elmo went away.\\" Robert also claimed that \\"There was trouble in the Pierce home, Mrs. Pierce and her husband didn't get along sometimes. My brother made a home for Winifred. It was more pleasant there, and so when he left I suppose she felt she would be happier with him.\\" Concerning his three quarreling sisters Robert said, \\"Those three sisters are good as gold, but they just don't seem to understand each other all the time.

Biography  Adams grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, the only child of Yale professor George Burton Adams. As a child, she visited England with her father, where she was first exposed to William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. She graduated from Vassar College in 1904, with no intention of practicing architecture. Six years later, she enrolled in the New York School of Applied Design for Women to study interior design. Adams received commissions from Vassar to remodel several campus buildings in 1914. The following year she decided to open her own interior design firm in New York City. During that first year, she received a commission to design a house for two Vassar professors, Edith Fahnestock and Rose Peebles. Adams would go on to design at least six Vassar residences over the course of forty years. Their architectural styles varied, including medieval, Tudor, and neoclassical architecture. She also served as a design consultant for Vassar until 1942. In this position she compiled annual inventories of all of the buildings owned by the college. In 1921, Adams became the architect for Yelping Hill in West Cornwall, Connecticut. Yelping Hill is a private community in West Cornwall Connecticut started by Henry Seidel Canby, Lee Wilson Dodd, Beverly Waugh Kunkel, Henry Noble MacCracken, David Stanley Smith, and Mason Trowbridge with their wives and children, and served as a summer community in the spirit of the Quaker camps in the Poconos. Adams designed all the residences, co-planned the community, and served as a construction foreman. The houses had no kitchens, as all dining took place in a communal dining room. Childcare was also a community task. These concepts and executions by Adams are considered by architecture historians to be an expression of Adams' feminist ideals. Despite focusing on architecture, Adams described herself as a \\"designer,\\" rather than an architect. Legacy Adams' achievements are located in the collection of the Vassar College archives. The records pertaining to her work with Yelping Hill are held by the Yelping Hill Association Archives.

Her works, though few, are noteworthy, designed in a modern style which draws on tradition. During her career, her buildings became ever more textural. In 1988, she became the first woman to be awarded the Margot and Thorvald Dreyer Foundation's Architecture Prize. The following year she was the first woman to be appointed professor at the Academy's School of Architecture. She also served on many influential boards and committees.Helle Bay, \\"Hanne Kj√¶rholm (1930-2009)\\", Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 5 February 2012. Early life Hanne Kj√¶rhom grew up in a liberal home in Hj√∏rring in the north of Jutland. After passing the school certificate at Hj√∏rring Gymnasium in 1949, she spent a year at the Design School for Women (Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder) hoping to become a fashion designer in Paris. After tiring of the prospect, she turned to architecture entering the Academy the following year and graduating in 1956. In 1953, while still at the Academy, she married Poul Kj√¶rholm who became a successful furniture designer. Career Apart from a project from 1957 to 1959 when she worked together with her husband on designing picnic areas with concrete tables and toilets for the country roads around Hj√∏rring, Hanne worked essentially on her own. The couple did however sometimes cooperate as when they built their own home in Rungsted in 1962. Hanne designed the building while Povl took care of the interiors. The simple, quiet house has since become recognized as a classic. Her design for a marina in Niv√• (1968) brought her the Academy's small gold medal although she was the only woman among 18 participants. In Nerja in the south of Spain, taking full account of local building traditions, she rebuilt and restored her own house in 1970 and in 1976, undertook similar work on a house belonging to Knud W. Jensen, director of the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. In 1974, her interest in Japanese architecture was reflected in an extension to a house in Birker√∏d which was fitted with sliding doors and a large red sliding gateway. In 1976, she won a commission to design an extension for the Holstebro Art Museum, adding a square-shaped structure pointing out in all directions. She wanted to show that a concrete building could be just as attractive as one built of brick or wood. The museum's functional requirements are beautifully addressed in a simple style, with plenty of daylight illuminating the exhibition spaces. Simplicity is also reflected in a summer house on L√¶s√∏ (1987) and in more recent projects including a second extension to the Holstebro Museum and the rebuilding of the Danish Museum of Art & Design from 1992 to 1995. Additional contributions Side by side with her architecture practice, from 1958 Hanne Kj√¶rholm was also employed as a research assistant at the Academy's School of Architecture until she was given an appointment as professor in 1989. She strove to promote the role of women in architecture, both at the Academy and at international conferences. She also served on a number of committees, including as vice-chairman of the Charlottenborg prize-giving panels. At the Academy she chaired the architecture committee from 1991 and served on the Arts Foundation's Decoration Committee. She arranged a number of exhibitions, including a retrospective of her husband's work at the Louisiana Museum after his death in 1980. She was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1985 and the C. F. Hansen Medal in 1993, and in 1998 she was granted a lifelong stipendium from the National Arts Foundation.

Sommerfeld (May 28, 1879 ‚Äì ?) was a German secret service agent in Mexico and the United States between 1908 and 1919. He was chief of the Mexican Secret Service under President Francisco I. Madero, worked as a diplomat and arms buyer for Venustiano Carranza and Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa, and ran the Mexican portion of Germany's war strategy in North America between 1914 and 1917.  Biography  Born on May 28, 1879 in Schneidem√ºhl, in the Prussian Province of Posen, Germany, Sommerfeld grew up in a middle class Jewish household as the youngest son of Pauline and Isidor Sommerfeld.http://trees.ancestry.de/tree/13912585/family/ After finishing high school Sommerfeld began studies in Berlin as a mining engineer. However, for unknown reasons he dropped out and came to the United States in 1898 to visit his brother.Staatsarchiv Hamburg, Bestand: 373-7 I, VIII (Auswanderungsamt I), Seite 353 (Mikrofilm Nr. K_1754) In the excitement over the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the 19-year-old joined the army but deserted a few months after.New York in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898: part of the report of the adjutant-general of the state for 1900. Volume II, Registers of organizations, p. 319 In 1900 Sommerfeld, this time as a German soldier, went to war in China to put down the Boxer Rebellion.Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, Heft 34, August 24, 1900 He was a \\"Meldereiter,\\" German for horse messenger. When he returned in 1901 he completed his mining engineering studies and returned to the United States in 1902.Staatsarchiv Hamburg, 373-7 I, VIII A 1 Band 135, Seite 2251 (Mikrofilm Nr. K_177) After briefly staying with his brother Julius in Chicago, Sommerfeld set out to the West as a prospector. He worked his way through Arizona, Sonora (Mexico) and Durango (Mexico) until 1905 when he returned to Chicago totally broke.City Directory, Chicago, Illinois, 1905, page 1477 Not much is known about the German adventurer between 1906 and 1908. It is possible that he returned to Germany and received secret service training in Berlin. In 1908, he suddenly showed up in Chihuahua, Mexico.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 68 He again worked as a mining engineer, however, in reality he became an informant for the German government. Chihuahua was ripe with rebellion and Sommerfeld did all he could to find out as much as possible about the anti-reelection movement led by wealthy Coahuila landowner, Francisco I. Madero. After the fraudulent elections that brought Porfirio D√≠az yet another term as president in 1910, the Mexican Revolution erupted. Sommerfeld ostensibly worked for AP News but filed regular intelligence reports for the German government. When forces supporting Madero succeeded in overthrowing the Diaz in May 1911, Sommerfeld joined the new president's entourage, first as a personal assistant, then as Mexico's chief of the secret service. Working under the direction of the president's brother, Gustavo A. Madero, Sommerfeld led the Mexican secret service.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 155 He helped put down the Orozco uprising in the spring of 1912, in the course of which he led the largest foreign secret service organization ever operating on U.S. soil.Charles H. Harris, III and Louis R. Sadler, The Underside of the Mexican Revolution: El Paso, 1912, The Americas, Vol. 39, No. 1 (July, 1982), p. 72 The secret service organization Sommerfeld built included Mexican-Americans, Mexican expatriates, other German agents such as Horst von der Goltz and Arnold Krumm- Heller, as well as two of the most notorious soldiers of fortune of the decade, Sam Dreben and Emil Lewis Holmdahl. In 1913, after Madero's overthrow and murder by Victoriano Huerta, Sommerfeld left Mexico under the protection of German ambassador Paul von Hintze, went to Washington, D.C. where he received funds from lawyer and Madero supporter Sherburne Hopkins and signed up with the rebel movement assembled to overthrow Huerta. Governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza, who declared against Huerta's regime and created the Constitutionalist revolutionary movement against it, sent Sommerfeld to El Paso and San Antonio to organize weapons for the revolutionaries.National Archives RG 65 M1085 Roll 853 file 232, William Offley to Department, May 23, 1913 Access to arms was a key element of a successful military movement. Northern Mexico's access to the border made procuring arms easier than in southern Mexico, where the Zapatistas operated. Sommerfeld also functioned as a liaison between the U.S. government and Carranza.Cumberland, The Constitutionalist Years, 279 In the spring of 1914, Sommerfeld began working closer with successful Constitutionalist Army General, Pancho Villa, commander of the Divisi√≥n del Norte. When Villa and Carranza split their alliance after the defeat of Huerta in July 1914 and a civil war of the winners ensued, Sommerfeld stayed with Villa as his chief weapons buyer in the U.S.Lazaro De La Garza Collection, University of Texas, Benson Library, Austin, TX, Box 1, Folder C, Villa to De La Garza, 4-14-1914 Sommerfeld also lobbied the U.S. government on Villa's behalf to receive diplomatic recognition. The task brought Sommerfeld close to General Hugh Lenox Scott and American Secretary of War, Lindley Miller Garrison, both of whom he assisted numerous times when U.S. nationals found themselves in trouble in Mexico.For example in the case of Emil Holmdahl, Papers of Hugh Lenox Scott, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Box 15, General Correspondence, F.A. Sommerfeld to L.M. Garrison, July 10, 1914 Sommerfeld was questioned following the mysterious disappearance of prominent writer Ambrose Bierce, who had attached himself to Villa's forces but then vanished without a trace.Friedrich Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, p. 865. When World War I broke out in August 1914, Sommerfeld moved to New York ostensibly to represent Pancho Villa's interests but actually worked for German Naval Attache Karl Boy-Ed. In his function as a specialist on Mexican affairs, Sommerfeld helped the German government sell arms and ammunition they had bought to keep them out of enemy Entente hands. Sommerfeld also had great knowledge of U.S. munitions factories, their capacities, order status, etc. His intelligence reports had a great influence on the formulation of Germany's war strategy vis-a-vis the United States. In 1915, Sommerfeld funneled large numbers of arms to Pancho Villa, the value being estimated to about $340,000 (About $7 million in today's value). Despite having large numbers of arms, Villa was decisively defeated by Constitutionalist Army General √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n in a series of battles in the Bajio, the most famous of which is the Battle of Celaya in 1915. Villa's huge army of movement, largely using massed cavalry charges, fell before Obreg√≥n's superior strategy and tactics of trenches improvised from agricultural irrigation ditches and machine guns. Villa's Divisi√≥n del Norte ceased to exist, and Villa became a guerrilla leader rather than the general of a major army of movement. In March 1916, Villa and a small group of men attacked the city of Columbus, NM. The Battle of Columbus resulted in civilian casualties and prompted the U.S., to send General John J. Pershing on a Punitive Mission, which was unsuccessful in its attempt to capture Villa. Sommerfeld, who had proposed to the German government in May 1915 that he could create an incident which would provoke a war between the U.S. and Mexico, became a prime suspect in Villa's attack on Columbus. However, no investigator or historian has been able to prove Sommerfeld's involvement. In June 1918, Sommerfeld was interned in Fort Oglethorpe, GA as an enemy alien.The Washington Post, June 21, 1918, \\"Held as Enemy Alien.\\" He was released in 1919. A few trips back and forth to Mexico have been recorded in the 1920s and 30s. However, the German agent disappeared in the 1930s, so far without a trace.

Early life Malcolm Plaw MacLeod was born in the province of Ontario, Canada, on 24 January 1897. Two differing sources place his birthplace as approximately 60 miles (95 km) northwest of Ottawa, Ontario. Both Arnprior and Renfrew are named as his native town.Canadian Hall of Valour website, http://www.canadaveteranshallofvalour.com/MacLeodMP.htm Note: Mapquest shows these two towns as being only 18 miles apart. MacLeod attended Kimberley Public School from 1905 until 1910; in 1911, he began study at the newly established University of Toronto Schools, matriculating there until 1917. On 13 August 1917, young MacLeod was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant on probation in the Royal Flying Corps.Supplement to the London Gazette, 1 November 1917, p. 11279. World War I Just over a year after his appointment as an officer, on 17 August 1918, MacLeod joined No. 41 Squadron of the newly formed Royal Air Force as a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a pilot. On 30 August at 1730 hours, he scored his first aerial victory, driving a Fokker D.VII down out of control southwest of Armenti√®res, France.Above the Trenches, p. 251. His next victory came at 0725 hours on 7 October 1918, when he drove down another Fokker D.VII south of Lille, France. On 30 October, he destroyed two German aircraft-a Halberstadt two-seater at 1145 hours northwest of B√©clers, Belgium, and a Fokker D.VII at 1600 hours north of Roeselare. On 4 November, he became both a balloon buster and an ace. He and William Ernest Shields cooperated in destroying an observation balloon at Pipaix, Belgium, before MacLeod destroyed another at Baugnies for his sixth victory. Five days later, MacLeod drove a Fokker D.VII down out of control over Renaix, Belgium, for his final win. MacLeod was awarded both a Distinguished Flying Cross and the Belgian Croix de Guerre for his valour. Post World War I MacLeod was transferred to the unemployed list of the Royal Air Force on 12 March 1919, effectively ending his term of military service.The London Gazette, 25 March 1919, pp. 3887, 3889.

On 15 July 1919, his Belgian Croix de guerre was also gazetted.Supplement to the London Gazette, 15 July 1919, p. 8987. MacLeod returned to Canada, taking up studies at the University of Toronto later in 1919. He finished up in 1921. Nothing is known of his next few years; however, he became a stockbroker in 1927 and followed that profession until his re- entry into service for World War II. From 1937 through 1960, he was managing director of Saunders-Roe. On 4 April 1941, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force as a pilot officer. He served in various training commands of the RCAF within Canada until he was discharged on 20 September 1945. He rose to the rank of flight lieutenant during his service.

Case  Nicola and Karen were best friends who lived close to one another on the Moulsecoomb estate in the north of Brighton but attended different schools. At around 3:30 p.m. on 9 October 1986, the two returned home from school before going out to play.The GuardianThe Telegraph At around 5 p.m., Susan Fellows saw her daughter and Karen playing with a roller boot, the last time she saw her daughter alive. When seen by a 14-year-old acquaintance near a parade of shops in the Lewes Road area, the girls were told to go home, as their parents would become worried. Nicola reportedly told Karen \\"Come on, let's go over to the park,\\" referring to Wild Park, where they were not allowed. At around 6:30 p.m., the girls were seen near a police box on Lewes Road, where Bishop was also seen near and wearing \\"what appeared to be a light blue top.\\" That same day, Bishop had gone to Nicola's house to speak to a lodger who lived there. Nicola told Bishop to go away and called his teenage girlfriend a \\"slag\\". When the girls failed to return home by their bedtime, their parents panicked. Karen's mother, Michelle, made a 999 call. A search party of around 200 police and neighbours was organized. A helicopter was brought in to help search Wild Park. Bishop joined the search, claiming his terrier Misty was a highly trained tracker dog and insured for ¬£17,000. The bodies of the girls were found in Wild Park by searchers Kevin Rowland and his friend Matthew Marchant on the afternoon of 10 October 1986. The girls' bodies were found hidden in a makeshift den in the park. An autopsy revealed that they had both been strangled and sexually assaulted. Bishop fell under suspicion due to his close involvement in the search. When the bodies of the girls were found, Bishop was close by and ran towards the scene with a police officer. However, the constable recalled that Bishop did not get close enough to even see them properly. Bishop's story was littered with inconsistencies. He told detectives that on the evening in question he had gone to Moulsecoomb because he intended to steal a car from the nearby University of Sussex campus. He also claimed he had gone to a newsagent to buy a newspaper but realised he had no money. Bishop told detectives he planned to see his teenage girlfriend that evening but failed to turn up because he bought some cannabis and went home instead. He also tailored his story to fit the evidence, claiming he had felt the girls' necks for a pulse after finding them dead, to explain any potential exchange of trace evidence. Due to the series of inconsistencies, Bishop was arrested on suspicion of murder on 31 October.  Russell Bishop  Bishop (b. 9 February 1966) was a petty thief and jobbing roofer. He was well-known around the Moulsecoomb estate in Brighton. In 1986, he lived in the Hollingdean area of the city, around from his two young victims. Despite living with his pregnant partner and young son, he had a reputation as a ladies' man with a string of girlfriends, some of whom were still in school. At the time of the murders he was having an affair with 16-year-old Marion Stevenson, who lived round the corner from Karen and Nicola. He played football and cricket with Barrie Fellows, Nicola's father. Bishop's friend Dougie Judd lodged with the Fellows family at the time of the murders. Judd knew both pairs of parents and warned Nicola and Karen to stay away from Bishop because of his clear sexual interest in young girls. His teammates recalled how he had a habit of wolf-whistling at schoolgirls when they walked past and stare intently at young girls in skirts doing handstands. There were suggestions that Bishop encouraged local teens to appear in homemade pornographic films that were passed around to men on the estate. Former friend Geoff Caswell, who used to go fishing with Bishop, described him as a habitual liar. Caswell said, \\"He was a typical lad around town that time. He'd grown a moustache and he had this car he'd race everywhere and he was always telling lies, trying to big himself up. He was only around 5'5\\" tall and weighed around eight stone, and I think he suffered from 'little man syndrome'. He was always telling porkies about this and that. He was also a thief. He'd break into cars and he'd steal stuff. He had been a roofer but was going nowhere really.\\" He also said Bishop was wrongly arrested on suspicion of involvement in the Brighton bombing.  Other suspects  Nicola's father, Barrie Fellows, was arrested in 2009 at his home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, on suspicion of rape and conspiracy to rape his daughter. Douglas Judd was also arrested for suspicion of sexual offenses. A spokeswoman for the Sussex Police said the investigation into sexual abuse allegations was unrelated to the ongoing murder inquiry. No charges were brought against either men, and they were subsequently released.  1987 trial  Bishop was initially tried for the rape and murder of the two girls in 1987 at Lewes Crown Court. He was acquitted by the jury after two hours of deliberations, attributed to a series of blunders in the prosecution's case. The pathologist and forensic investigation team failed to record the temperatures of the bodies and therefore could not accurately state a time of death. At the trial, the prosecution suggested the girls were killed between 6:15 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Without scientific evidence to back up the time of the murders, the prosecution could not challenge Bishop's alibis on the night of the murders. Though the girls were strangled to death, neither measurements of hand marks around their necks or fingerprints left by the strangler were taken. Forensic scientists did not analyse blood discovered on Karen's underwear. A key piece of the prosecution's case rested on the recovery of a blue Pinto brand sweatshirt. The top was found close to the railway line of Moulsecoomb station. Police believed Bishop discarded the top after attacking and killing the girls and were confident the clothing held a cache of forensic clues. The police did not properly preserve the evidence, allowing Bishop's defence team to cast doubt on the reliability of the material. Under questioning, Bishop denied that the sweatshirt belonged to him, but his girlfriend, Jenny Johnson, alleged the clothing was Bishop's. Prosecution hoped this would undermine Bishop's credibility and portray him as a liar who was trying to distance himself from a crucial piece of evidence. However, at the trial Johnson changed her story, telling the jury she had never seen the top before. The judge, Justice Schiemann, \\"directed the jury that unless they were sure first, that the girls were dead by 6:30 p.m. ‚Ä¶ they should acquit.\\" The prosecution believed that the girls were killed between 5:15 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. However, witnesses stated they saw the girls alive at 6:30 p.m. and Bishop leaving Wild Park at 6:30 p.m. Bishop was convicted in December 1990 of a similar attack on another Brighton girl. He was found guilty of the kidnapping and attempted murder of a 7-year-old girl in Whitehawk 10 months earlier and was sentenced to at least 14 years before eligible for release. He was turned down twice by the parole board.  2018 trial  The 2005 repeal of the double jeopardy provisions of the Criminal Justice Act of 2003 meant Bishop could face a fresh trial with substantial new evidence. Eurofins Forensic Services was engaged, the same forensics team that helped bring the killers of Stephen Lawrence to justice. Senior scientific adviser Roy Green at Eurofins was asked in August 2012 to re-examine the evidence and recovered a billion-to-one DNA match linking Bishop to the discarded sweatshirt. A taping from Karen's left forearm was also found to contain Bishop's DNA. On 10 May 2016, a suspect was arrested for the murders.Man arrested over 1986 'babes in the wood' murders in Brighton The Guardian, 10 May 2016. Retrieved 10 May 2016. In December 2017, the Court of Appeal ordered quashing the 1987 acquittals and called for a second jury trial for Bishop. On 2 February 2018, the prosecution announced that Bishop would be tried for the murders at the Old Bailey. In May 2016, Bishop was removed from his cell at Frankland Prison in County Durham and taken to the local police station, where he was arrested for the murders of Karen and Nicola. The trial was scheduled for 15 October 2018.Russell Bishop 'murdered two Brighton schoolgirls in 1986' BBC Prosecutor Brian Altman QC told the jury the case against Bishop was not just based on his attempt to kill another child in a similar manner, but on \\"other compelling evidence.\\" He explained \\"significant part of the enquiry had been to re-evaluate various areas of scientific work that were performed for the purposes of the 1987 trial but through the lens of modern day techniques, DNA profiling which although available in 1986 and 1987 was then in its infancy.\\" Bishop suggested that Nicola's father, Barrie, was to blame, telling the jury the police spent \\"32 years building a case against the wrong man\\". Bishop was not in court every day for his nine-week trial and complained to the judge about feeling \\"suicidal\\" over his temporary stay at Belmarsh, requesting his return to Frankland. At the 2018 trial, the prosecution put forward a different timeline. Altman presented evidence that the girls were alive at 6:30 p.m. and that Bishop returned to Wild Park. Defence witnesses at the 1987 trial returned as prosecution witnesses in 2018. At this trial, Altman argued the forensic samples taken as \\"tapings\\" in 1986 were so carefully handled by the police and preserved by scientists that he could present them as a \\"time capsule\\" to prove Bishop's guilt. On 10 December 2018, after a nine-week trial at the Central Criminal Court, or Old Bailey, a jury of seven men and five women returned a guilty verdict after two-and-a-half hours of deliberation. Further criminal action In March 2020 it was announced that Jennifer Johnson, Bishop's girlfriend at the time of the murders, was to be charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to the police statements and court evidence which she had given during the original investigation and 1987 trial.

Directed by Canadian film director Brendon Culliton, and co-directed by Dan Heald, it is their first long feature documentary film and is a Joint Media Group Inc (JMGI) production co-founded by Culliton himself. Marc Diab Marc Diab was born on 23 September 1986 in Ain Ebel, Lebanon to Hani Diab and Jihan Falah. He had two older sisters, Jessica and Maya. He and his family moved to Canada as immigrants in 2000, and Marc became a Canadian citizen on 11 June 2004 and lived in Mississauga, Ontario. He was very active in his community and took part in many church and youth projects. Marc fell in love with Mary Barakat, a girl he had met in Lebanon and planned to propose to as soon as he returned home from his assignment. Despite being the sole son in his family, he decided to serve in the Canadian Forces. While on leave, he made a point of coming back to Mississauga and taking part in youth camps inspiring the participating kids, and becoming a role model and a mentor to them. He also took a lot of video footage and photographs he went. When he left for Afghanistan, a Facebook account was created in his support with 1700 members and supporters. He died on March 8, 2009 after his vehicle hit an Improvised explosive device (IED) in Shah Wali Kot district, Kandahar province. He was the 112th Canadian soldier to die in Afghanistan. He was just 22 years old and only weeks away from coming home. There was a huge outpour of grief and support from his community and friends and fellow soldiers when he died. Trooper Marc Diab Memorial Park was inaugurated in June 2010 in Mississauga, Ontario in his memory.Mississauga.com: Mark Diab Memorial unites community His family and relatives also opened a Lebanese restaurant Madameek in his memory, just next to his base in Petawawa. The restaurant contains memorabilia that once belonged to Diab. Brendon Culliton Brendon Culliton (b. 1987) currently lives in London, Ontario and is a Canadian documentary film director. He graduated from Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology specializing in the college's TV broadcasting program. He is a co-founder and producer with Joint Media Group Inc. with his father Paul Culliton. If I Should Fall is his first major film. He is preparing another documentary titled General Racing about the career of Major-General Lewis MacKenzie. The film is in post- production. Synopsis If I Should Fall eloquently portrays the story of one martyred soldier, and in doing so, tells the story of many others. The original idea by Joint Media Group Inc. of London, Ontario was to try to make a pilot for TV called Afghan Diaries two years prior and wanted to do an episode on what happens when a soldier dies.Ubiquitous magazine: Documentary of Fallen Soldier Helping Others Understand War and Loss Executive Producer Michael Roberts had been friends with the Diabs, through their restaurant in Streetsville (Mississauga), and introduced the family to Paul when they were first talking about creating the Afghan Diaries. Paul Culliton and Roberts felt that they had a lot of excellent material provided by the Diabs and at their suggestion, Brendon decided to focus on Marc Diab, a 22-year-old trooper of The Royal Canadian Dragoons and of Lebanese origin who on March 8, 2009, was killed in Afghanistan when his vehicle struck an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). The film uses some footage videotaped by Marc Diab himself and many other soldiers narrating process when IEDs were found. The film furthermore includes hand-held footage taken by another warrior of the scene after his own armoured personnel carrier was hit by an IED.The Toronto Sun: YouTube brings home reality of war It also uses a montage prepared by Diab himself, called \\"See You Tomorrow\\" for his loved ones in case he didn't come home alive. In the wake of his death, countless lives were changed forever. The documentary tells the story of Marc Diab's life through the accounts of those who loved him: his family (father Hani Diab and mother Jihan Falah), his comrades of D Squadron, Royal Canadian Dragoons, based in Petawawa, Ont., and his beloved girlfriend. Viewers see the human face behind the honor and sacrifice of soldiers and the heavy price they and their families pay for their nation. Supported by an ensemble of renowned Canadian military experts, including retired Major General Lewis MacKenzie, Esprit de Corps magazine's Scott Taylor, and author Captain Ray Wiss M.D., the film explores the conflict in Afghanistan and the timeless tragedy of what it means to lose a loved one to war. Music The film featuring music by award-winning Canadian artist Loreena McKennitt Charity A DVD release (in two versions, the official release version and another version with extended footage in addition to further testimonies) was also released with proceeds going to the Marc Diab Children's Foundation and the Military Families' Fund.

He is remembered today as a pioneer in the art of clock design and construction. He was the father of Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio. Jacopo Dondi wrote on a number of subjects, including surgery, pharmacology, astrology and natural science. Life The replica of the astronomical clock of Jacopo Dondi dell'Orologio in the Torre dell'Orologio, Padua Jacopo Dondi was born in Chioggia, the son of a doctor named Isacco. He attended the University of Padua and was elected municipal physician in Chioggia in 1313. In about 1327 he married Zaccarota Centrago or Centraco, with whom he had eight children; the second-born, Giovanni, became famous as the builder of the Astrarium. On 28 February 1334, Jacopo received Venetian citizenship from the Doge Francesco Dandolo. In 1342 he moved to Padova, where he became a professor of medicine and of astronomy at the University. He supervised the construction of a large public clock with a dial, commissioned by Prince Ubertino I da Carrara. He may also have contributed to its design. The clock was installed in the tower of the Palazzo Capitaniato, Padua in 1344. There is some evidence that it indicated and struck the hours from 1 to 24, and also that it displayed the age and phase of the moon and the place of the sun in the zodiac. Both the tower and the clock were destroyed in 1390, when the Milanese stormed the palace. A replica of the clock is in the Torre dell'Orologio, Padua, which was built in 1428. He died in Padua between 29 April and 26 May 1359, and was buried outside the Baptistry of San Giovanni, Padua. Written works Title-page of the 1610 edition of Dondi's Enumeratio remediorum. The most celebrated work of Jacopo Dondi is the Aggregator or Promptuarium medicinae ed Enumeratio remediorum simplicium et compositorum, completed in 1355 and conserved in manuscript in the Vatican (Vat. lat. 2462, 14th century), the Collegio di Spagna, Bologna (MS 153, dated 1425) and the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris (Lat. 6973 and 6974). It was published in Strasburg in about 1470 by the \\"R-printer\\" (Adolph Rusch) and in Venice in 1481 by Michele Manzolo. It was reprinted in Venice in 1542 by Tommaso and Giovanni Maria Giunta, and again in 1576. The section on surgery, Enumeratio remediorum simplicium et compositorum ad affectus omnes qui a chirurgo curantur, was included in the Chirurgia: de chirurgia scriptores optimi quique veteres et recentiores of Conrad Gesner, printed at Zurich in 1555 by his cousins Andreas and Iacobus Gesner, and in the Thesaurus chirurgiae of Peter Uffenbach (1610). The Aggregator should not be confused with the illustrated Herbarius of Peter Sch√∂ffer (Mainz, 1484; subsequently reprinted at Venice, in Latin and in Italian with the title Herbolario), which was subtitled Aggregator practicus de simplicibus. In natural science, Dondi published in about 1355 a Tractatus de causa salsedinis aquarum et modo conficiendi sal artificiale ex aquis Thermalibus Euganeis (Biblioteca del Seminario, Padova, ms. 4540), which was included in Giunti's De balneis omnia quae extant apud Graecos, Latinos et Arabas (1553), together with De fontibus calidis agri Patavini consideratio by his son Giovanni. Dondi's treatise on the tides, De fluxu atque refluxu maris, probably dates from between 1355 and 1359. It was frequently cited in the 14th and 15th centuries; the De fluxu ac refluxu maris subtilis et erudita disputatio of Federico Delfino (1559) plagiarises it, as does the anonymous 16th-century manuscript Questio de estu sive de fluxu et refluxu maris per sex horas in the Biblioteca Casanatense of Rome. Dondi is credited with having painted the first topographic map of the territory of Padua. Now lost, it was used by his son Giovanni in the negotiations following the war of 1372‚Äì73 between Venice and Padua, and is described as \\"a map by the hand of Jacomo de' Dondi, physician, who was a most subtle man in the art of painting\\" (\\"una carta facta per man de un maistro Jacomo de' Dondi fisico, el qual fo subtilissimo homo in l'arte de pinger\\"). Dondi made an adaptation to the meridian of Padua of the astrological Tabulae de motibus planetarum or Toletanae, the alfonsine tables attributed to Alfonso X el Sabio, King of Castile. The work was in the possession of Giovanni in 1389, and was cited and praised by Beldomandi in his Canones de motibus corporum supercoelestium (1424), but was later lost. It has also been suggested that it was the work not of Jacopo but of one of his sons, either Gabriele or Giovanni. In his Ad inveniendum primum ascendens nativitatis, preserved in manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (1468; Canon. misc. 436) and the Osterreichische Nationalbibliotek, Vienna, (15th century; Lat. 5208), Dondi showed that the ascendant at the time of birth was the same as the house of the moon at the time of conception. A short historical work preserved in manuscripts in the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana (Marc. lat. X, 34 (3129)) and the Biblioteca del Seminario of Padua (MS. 11) dates from about 1334. Dondi also wrote on grammar. Bernardino Scardeone records a manuscript copied in Venice in 1372 of Dondi's expositiones on the Magnae derivationes of Uguccione da Pisa. Thought to be lost, the work survives in manuscripts in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, (301), the Bodleian (Canon. misc. 201) and the Biblioteca universitaria of Pavia (Aldini 258).

He participated in the Akƒ´tu, or new year festival, first in the beginning of the second year of his reign, as his rule extended into northern Babylonia and he suppressed the incursions of nomads around Babylon and Borsippa, restoring fields and orchards to their former owners.

Not all restorations, however, were to the liking of his successors. According to the Harran stele of Nabonidus (555‚Äì539 BC), his reign witnessed a sacrilegious reform of the cult of I≈°tar (bƒìltu ≈°a Uruk, ‚Äúlady of Uruk‚Äù), when the people of Uruk replaced her statue with an unsuitable one, unyoking its team of lions and removing its shrine.

He had contacts with the Kommune 1 and with several people who would go on to form the German terrorist organization, Rote Armee Fraktion. He supplied the scene with weapons, Molotov cocktails and bombs. In 2005 it was revealed that Urbach had supplied the bomb for the November 9, 1969 attempted attack on the Jewish Community Center in Berlin by the Tupamaros West-Berlin. The bomb failed to explode, but a police report concluded that it contained enough explosives to have killed many of the 250 people present in the center at the time. The people behind the attack were known by the prosecutor's office, but they were not charged, presumably to avoid uncovering the government's involvement. In 1970 information by Urbach led to the first arrest of Andreas Baader who would go on to lead the Rote Armee Fraktion.

A childhood accident resulted in a broken leg and contributed to a lifelong impairment that required her to use a crutch. This condition may have changed her focus from helping with outdoor farm work to studying, writing and reading. It did not prevent her from hiking in the Berkeley Hills and the Sierras. After working first as a science teacher and writer, she changed her profession in mid-life and followed her dream of becoming an architect.  First career as a science teacher and writer  Bridgman was originally from Kansas, where she obtained her science degree in 1888 from Kansas State Agricultural College. She was impressed by a textbook by Professor Joseph LeConte of the University of California at Berkeley and decided to study science under him, earning a master's degree in 1893. After graduation, she taught physics and chemistry at several schools in California, including the California School of Mechanical Arts, between 1893 and 1910. She was also a writer, authoring short stories and poems which were published in popular journals. In 1898, she enrolled for further graduate studies at Cornell University but fell seriously ill and had to drop out. During her recovery, she dreamt of building her own house and was encouraged by her friend, architect Bernard Maybeck, to sketch her ideas. After buying a small property near Blackberry Canyon in Berkeley with an inheritance, she hired an architect, William Knowles, to prepare the construction drawings. The House focuses on natural light and views of the San Francisco Bay. The home's exterior is clad with brown shingles as typical for First Bay Tradition houses. The interior featured local unpainted redwood paneling and built-in window seats that could be transformed into beds for visitors. In 1908 she added a studio on the upper part of the property which would later serve as her architectural office. For many years, Lillian Bridgman lived with her sister, Irene, a nurse, sometimes staying in the studio and renting out the front house to boarders.  Second career as an architect  After this first architectural experience and being frustrated with her low-paying job as a female science teacher, Bridgman started her second career and, at the age of 44, quit her job and enrolled from 1910-1912 at the University of California to study architecture. After having gained practical experience as a draftsperson in the office of Walter Ratcliff Jr., she became a certified architect in California in 1915 and opened her own office in downtown Berkeley in the First National Bank building. Not uncommon for beginning practitioners, her clients were family members, friends or word-of-mouth referrals, often women of her large circle of friends. She received one of her first major commissions, the Orchard Cottage for Milicent Shinn in Niles, California (today Fremont) in 1916. She had met Milicent Shinn, a child psychologist and the first woman to earn a doctorate at UC Berkeley, as the editor of the Overland Monthly and publisher of some of her prose. In an extensive correspondence with Miss Bridgman, Dr. Shinn described her wishes and ideas for a house of her own - to which she referred to as her \\"old maid's cottage\\" - after she had shared accommodations with her brother and his family. The two-story house has a large living room on the ground floor with wide windows opening to the rural surroundings, and bedrooms on the second floor. The house was originally located near Alameda Creek on the family property. The remaining four acres of the property is now a park in Fremont, the Shinn Historical Park and Arboretum. The house was moved from the flood plain to its current address at 1119 Mowry Avenue in Fremont. Lilian Bridgman's architectural work is concentrated in Berkeley with a few exceptions in the nearby Bay Area and a proposal for a housing development with a playground in Junction City, Kansas, where her brother was the city engineer, which was not built. Her early work is strongly influenced by the philosophy of the Hillside Club of which she was a founding member. The Club promoted a rustic architecture to enhance the natural setting of the North Side of Berkeley. The ideas were published in 1904 by Charles Keeler in a booklet The Simple Home. After the 1923 Berkeley Fire, Lilian Bridgman was among the architects involved in the rebuilding of Berkeley. She used the Hotel Whitecotton as a meeting place with clients. The Fire led to a change in building materials from shingled walls and cedar shake roofs to the use of stucco and tile roofs which can also be observed in the architecture of Bridgman. Lilian Bridgman did not only contribute to the environment of Berkeley with her simple and harmonious houses but was also involved in the community and lectured to educate the public about building homes. One example is her lecture Art in House Building in Relation to the Community and to Purposes of a Home which she presented to the College Women‚Äôs Club. She was also active in the Association of Collegiate Alumnae (now the Association of American University Women AAUW) and the National Housing Association and served on their national committees.

In the Assembly, Sumter serves on the Assembly Labor Committee (as Vice-Chair), the Health and Senior Services Committee, and the Law and Public Safety Committee. She holds the leadership positions of Majority Conference Leader since 2015 and was Deputy Speaker from 2014 to 2015. As of September 2016, Sumter was considering a run for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2017, and was also considered the leading candidate for selection as the party's candidate for lieutenant governor.http://observer.com/2016/09/the-battle-of-fort-sumter- top-tier-gubernatorial-candidates-share-a-common-lg-play/ However, the eventual Democratic nominee for governor, Phil Murphy, chose Assemblywoman Sheila Oliver as his running mate. A resident of Paterson, she is married to Kenneth Sumter and has two children.

He worked in the firm's Auckland office on High Street. Hoggard left the partnership in 1921, leaving Prouse and Gummer in partnership until its dissolution 1923. In 1924 he started the firm Gummer and Ford with Charles Reginald Ford. This new partnership won many architectural competitions around New Zealand.

The teams Battle Creek Belles, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kalamazoo Lassies, Kenosha Comets, Peoria Redwings, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox competed through a 112-game schedule, while the Shaugnessy playoffs featured the top four teams from each half of the regular season.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League teams by season In 1951, many things changed in relation to the previous season, when attendance began to decline dramatically. The Racine Belles franchise was moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, while the Chicago Colleens and Springfield Sallies traveling teams were disbanded. Betty Foss of Fort Wayne led all hitters for the second year in a row with a .368 batting average, breaking her own single-season record of .346 set in her rookie season. Foss also topped the league with 34 doubles, setting an all-time single-season record that would never be surpassed. Nine pitchers recorded an earned run average below 2.00, while Rose Gacioch of Rockford was the only one to gain 20 victories during the year. The Player of the Year Award was given to South Bend pitcher Jean Faut, who posted a 15‚Äì7 record with a 1.33 ERA and a league- leading 135 strikeouts, including a perfect game against Rockford on July 21 of that season.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.C.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295pp. Language: English. During the best- of-three series, first-place South Bend defeated third-place Fort Wayne, two games to one, while second-place Grand Rapids swept fourth-place Rockford in two games. South Bend pitching star Jean Faut drove in a run and held Fort Wayne to a run in Game 1, and later struck out nine batters and allowed one run in Game 3 to advance to the finals. In the other series, Rockford's Helen Nicol gave up six hits and shut out Grand Rapids in the first contest, while Marie Mansfield hurled a 7‚Äì6, 11-inning victory to defeat the Chicks.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book The final series took all five games to decide the champion team. Rockford held a 2‚Äì0 advantage in the series and looked to take it all, but South Bend rebounded and won the last three games to clinch the title. In Game 3, Faut stopped the Peaches in their tracks, pitching a six-hit, 3‚Äì2 victory, and picked up the win in a seven-inning relief effort in Game 5 to continue her winning ways. South Bend batted a collective .275 average in the finals, with Jane Stoll leading the offense with a .333 average (6-for-18) and six RBI, while Senaida Wirth batted .412 (7-for-17) and scored four runs, and Betty Wagoner hit .389 (7-for-18) with five runs. In 1951, the AAGPBL attendance declined for the third straight year. As revenues fell, individual teams' funds were limited to advertise nationally as a way of recruiting scattered baseball talent. With no centralized control of publicity, promotion, rookie training teams, and equalization of player talent, the League began to break down. The Kenosha and Peoria franchises withdrew at the end of the year, leaving the league with six teams for the next season.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League history Standings =First half= { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;

According to DuCange (s.v. cervulus), sacrilegious songs were sung. This happened even in the vicinity of St. Peter's in Rome\\" > Feast of the Ass The Feast of the Ass was ostensibly commemorating the role of donkeys in the Flight into Egypt, observed mainly in France. Some accounts of the Christian version of the festival say that a pregnant woman from a village would ride a donkey to a local church. In Beauvais, each operation of the mass, instead of saying \\"Amen\\" the congregation would bray \\"Y-a\\" There the donkey would stand near the altar during the saying of the mass. Attention to this connection was drawn by Carl Jung, \\"On the Psychology of the Trickster-Figure\\" in The archetypes and the collective unconscious (pp. 257‚Äì259) Jung mentions \\"a codex dating apparently from the 11th century\\", according to which \\"At the end of the mass, instead of the words 'Ite missa est,' the priest would bray three times.

Early life  Grossmann was born in Beechworth, Victoria, Australia on 8 September 1863, to Mary Ann Beeby and George Smales Searle. She was the fourth of their five children. Grossmann's parents were acquaintances of the parents of Alfred William Howitt, an explorer who rescued the sole survivor of Robert O'Hara Burke's ill-fated expedition of 1861. As Grossmann was born almost exactly two years after this rescue, they gave their daughter the middle name \\"Howitt\\". Her father was initially a wine merchant in Australia, before becoming a newspaper editor. The family moved to Melbourne and then, in 1878, to Invercargill, where Searle became editor of The Southland Times newspaper.  Education  In Invercargill, Grossmann attended Invercargill Grammar School for a year, before being sent to Christchurch Girls' High School. The principal, Helen Connon, encouraged Grossmann to continue her studies to the end of secondary school, and to apply for a university scholarship. In her final year, Grossmann was head girl of the school. Grossmann studied at Canterbury College from 1880 to 1885, during which time she received a number of prizes and honours, and was also an active participant in student life. She had received a junior scholarship to enter the College, and in 1882 also received a senior scholarship. In 1881, she won second prize in the Bowen Essay Competition, and in 1882, the first prize. Grossmann was also a member of the university debating society and participated in debates on contemporary issues such as the Married Women's Property Bill of 1884, and the higher education of women. When Grossmann completed her studies, she held both a B.A. degree and an M.A. degree with first class honours in Latin and English, and third class honours in political science.  Career  After her graduation, Grossmann taught at Wellington Girls' College until 1890, initially as assistant mistress, then later as second assistant. Her non-fiction writing ranged from essays on theology and philosophy to articles on the women's movement, and pieces of literary criticism, and appeared in a number of publications, including the Empire Review and the Westminster Review. She also wrote fiction, including poetry, which was published in Zealandia magazine, and short stories, published in the Otago Daily Times. From 1903 to 1912 she lived in London and was a freelance writer there, often writing on issues related to New Zealand. While living in London, she was a founding member of the New Zealand Circle at the Lyceum Club, a club for professional women, and a member of The Austral, another club specifically for women from the colonies. Grossmann found these clubs very useful for making contacts in the writing world, and advised other women to join them. Some of her fellow club members were Kate Isitt and Dora Wilcox. Grossmann was the author of four novels and one biography: * Angela;- A Messenger (1890) * In Revolt (1893) * A Knight of the Holy Ghost (1907); republished as Hermione; A Knight of the Holy Ghost (1908) * A Life of Helen Macmillan Brown (1905) * The Heart of the Bush (1910) Grossmann was an advocate of women's suffrage and in 1892 she and her husband were founding members of the Canterbury Women's Institute, which campaigned for the vote. She signed the suffrage petition submitted to Parliament in 1893 by Kate Sheppard.  Personal life  In 1890, Grossmann married Joseph Penfound Grossmann, a master at Wellington Boys' High School, who had been a fellow student of hers at Canterbury College. Grossmann resigned from her teaching position and the couple moved back to Christchurch where her husband took a teaching position at Christchurch Boys' High School. Their only child, Arthur Searle, was born in 1894, and was considered to be intellectually handicapped. Grossmann separated from her husband around 1897, and the couple never reconciled. Arthur lived with Grossmann, including in London, until around 1914, when his father arranged for him to live on a farm near Christchurch with family friends. This enforced separation from her son had a significant impact on Grossmann's mental health; she wrote a letter to the editor of the Auckland Star as late as 1929, in which she complained of the effects of separating the mentally ill from their loved ones. Grossmann died on 27 February 1931 at her home in Auckland.  Legacy  In 1999, the Canterbury Branch of the New Zealand Society of Authors laid a trail of 32 plaques around Christchurch commemorating notable writers of the city, including Edith Grossmann.

Life  Henry was a son of Margrave John I of Brandenburg and his third wife, Jutta, the daughter of Duke Albert I of Saxony. The origin of his nickname \\"Lackland\\" is not known. Henry was more than fifteen years younger than his brothers John II, Otto IV \\"with the arrow\\" and Conrad I and was therefore likely to be excluded from governing when his brothers inherited the Margraviate. It was not until 1294 he began to participate in the government of the country. When he did, he received -- according to an excerpt from the Bohemian chronicler P≈ôib√≠k Pulkava -- Delitzsch as his seat. Delitzsch was located in the Margraviate of Landsberg, which Margrave Albert II of Meissen had sold to the Margraves of Brandenburg. From then on, Henry used the title of Margrave of Landsberg in addition to Margrave of Brandenburg in almost all documents. As Margrave of Landsberg, he fought several feuds with neighbouring princes. He was excommunicated by archbishop Burchard II of Magdeburg. In 1311, Henry lost a feud to Duke Rudolf I of Saxony and had to hand over the County Palatine of Saxony with the castles Grillenberg Castle in Sangerhausen and Raspenburg Castle in Rastenberg to Rudolf I. He also lost a feud to Margrave Dietrich IV of Lusatia. After Emperor Henry VII, Henry's nephew Margrave Waldemar proposed to elect Henry I as King of the Romans. Henry I appears to have declined the proposal, and his promised by deed to vote for Duke Frederick the Fair or his brother Leopold I. However, in the end, Henry voted for Duke Louis IV of Bavaria.

Today existed a dominant view in historiography consistent with her filiation and death date. According to them, Adelaide was indeed the daughter of Casimir II the Just and died in 1211, but wasn't the foundress of the Convent of St. James and only another nun there.O.

In the 19th century, appeared a theory which states that Adelaide was the daughter of Casimir I of Kuyavia, who entered in the Convent of St. James as a nun and died there in 1291.O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, pp. 337‚Äì339. This view, accepted by several scholars, has been disputed. More recent historiography recognized her as the daughter of Casimir II the Just, founder of the Convent, in which was she buried after her death in 1211.K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw 2001, pp. 17‚Äì22. Life Jan D≈Çugosz reported that Adelaide was the daughter of Casimir II the Just.J.

The fact that she never married and became a nun, supports the presumption that at the time of her father's death in 1194 her future had not yet been decided.K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw 2001, p. 21. Her birth date was placed between the late 1170s and early 1180s. By convention among the offspring of Casimir II and Helena of Znojmo she is placed in the fifth place, after Odon (who died in infancy) and before Leszek I the White and Konrad I of Masovia. The origin of her name is unclear. Historians have posed three theories about it:K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw 2001, pp. 20‚Äì21. *She was probably named after Casimir's maternal grandmother Adelaide of Mochental, mother of Salomea of Berg. However the chronological distance between the Countess of Berg and the Piast princess was significant, and thus it might be unlikely that Casimir II named his daughter for his grandmother. *Another possibility was that Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth and Salomea of Berg had a daughter named Adelaide who died in infancy (and for this reason is not mentioned in sources) whose tomb would be in the country, and Casimir II named his daughter after her. *She could have been named after Adelaida Zbyslava, daughter of Boles≈Çaw I the Tall, Casimir II's nephew and ally for several years. In this case, Adelaide would have been born between 1177 and 1184, when Casimir and Boles≈Çaw were allied. Tombstone of Adelaide at St. James Convent, Sandomierz. Adelaide was the foundress of the Convent of St. James in Sandomierz, where in 1226 thanks to Iwo OdrowƒÖ≈º, Bishop of Krak√≥w, the Dominicans settled.Jan D≈Çugosz in his work Roczniki czyli kroniki s≈Çawnego Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego reported that in 1200 Adelaide founded the Dominican Convent. However, in the work Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis he said that she only founded a Church. O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, pp. 337‚Äì338 and K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw 2001, pp. 18‚Äì19, said that Adelaide founded a minor Church. She probably was also a nun in the Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica during the rule of the first Abbess Petrissa.O. Balzer took this report from the 18th century chronicle of Arnold Teicher, quoted in the work of A. Bach: Geschichte und Beschreibung des f√ºrstlichen jungfr√§ulichen Klosterstiftes Cistercienser Ordens in Trebnitz..., issued in Nysa in 1859. However, this work considered that Adelaide was the daughter of Casimir I of Kuyavia and died in 1291. O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, p. 418. She died on 8 December 1211,Date given by Jan D≈Çugosz and accepted by O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, p. 339, and K.

Her Gothic tombstone was founded at the end of the 14th or early 15th century.In favor of the earlier date was K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw 2001, p. 22, note. 46; in favor of the later one was S.A. Sroka: Adelajda, [in:] K. O≈º√≥g, S. Szczur (ed.), Piastowie.

Around the figure is a contains Latin inscription: ::. ::In English: Here lies Lady Adelaide, daughter of Duke Casimir, foundress of the monastery and died in the year of our Lord 1211. The inscription on the tombstone that mentioned Adelaide as the foundress of the Convent was known by Jan D≈Çugosz, but was translated by the Dominicans, and this probably resulted in the error of the source. =The theory of a Kuyavian origin= The head of Adelaide on the doors of St. James' Church in Sandomierz. In the 19th century an incompatible theory arose regarding Adelaide's origins. It was assumed that the Piast princess buried in the Dominican Church of Sandomierz was a nun and not the foundress. Since the Convent was established in 1226, it seems impossible that she could have died in 1211. It's considered unlikely that she was the daughter of Casimir II the Just, because this supposed that she took the veil at the late age of 40 or previously lived in another Monastic rule.O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, p. 338. The doubt arose about the paternity of the Casimir II made historians recognize Adelaide as the daughter of Casimir I of Kuyavia.The first researcher who placed Adelaide as the daughter of Casimir I of Kuyavia was Ivan Vahylevych in his work Genealogia ksiƒÖ≈ºƒÖt i kr√≥l√≥w polskich od roku 880‚Äì1195. Aleksander Semkowicz support this view in his work Krytyczny rozbi√≥r dziej√≥w polskich Jana D≈Çugosza do roku 1384, Krak√≥w 1887, p. 203. O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, pp. 337‚Äì339, exposed a complete argument who supported this view. However, modern historiography followed the opinion of Stos≈Çaw ≈Åaguna, who was one of the first who reaffirmed the fact that Adelaide was a daughter of Casimir II the Just in his work Rodowodzie Piast√≥w, \\"Kwartalnik Historyczny\\" n¬∞11, 1897, p. 767, like W. Dworzaczek: Genealogia, Warsaw 1959, tabl. 3 and K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw 2001, p. 17. It was proposed that she was born shortly before 7 April 1249 from the second marriage of the Kuyavian Duke with Constance, daughter of Henry II the Pious, Duke of Wroc≈Çaw.O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, p. 339, showed a document issued by Siemowit I of Masovia, Casimir I's brother on 7 April 1249 where he mentioned a family celebration, who he believes was the christening of Adelaide. After 1278 she entered into the Dominican Convent in Sandomierz, located in the lands of her brother Leszek II the Black. The title of foundress placed in her tombstone was probably thanks to either her prestige or through the intercession of her brother Leszek II.O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, pp. 338‚Äì339. She died on 8 December 1291 and the year of 1211 on the tombstone was explained as carelessness of the sculptor.O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, pp. 338‚Äì339. Balzer claimed that the sculptor omitted a C letter ‚Äî instead of MCCXCI he carved MCCXI. This interpretation, which was accepted by historians for many years, has been questioned in more recent times.K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, vol. I, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, p. 121, note 7, accused Balzer of basing his theory about Adelaide's origins on only suppositions and not actual facts corroborated in older sources. As where mentioned the reports of Jan D≈Çugosz, who supposedly named Adelaide as a nun in the Dominican Convent; a further examination of this showed that a woman couldn't be a nun in a manly Order and the chronicler, indeed, never mentioned the religious Order of the princess.Jacek Woroniecki in his work ', Katowice 1947, p. 86, stated that D≈Çugosz only said that Adelaide was a pious woman dedicated to the service of God, from which O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, pp. 337-338 concluded that she was a nun. See K. Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw 2001, p. 18. Another fact which supports the view that was Adelaide was not a Kuyavian Piast was that she was not directly mentioned in any contemporary sources related to genealogy or filiation. If Adelaide was indeed the daughter of Casimir I and Constance, she would have been mentioned in the Genealogii ≈õw. Jadwigi (Genealogy of St. Jadwiga), compiled before or at the latest during 1301, but only the two sons born from the second marriage of the Kuyavian Duke - Leszek II the Black and Ziemomys≈Ç - are mentioned. In addition, Adelaide was not mentioned in the Genealogy written by the Franciscan friar Henry of Brehna, nephew of Casimir I,Son of Eudoxia of Masovia and Dietrich I, Count of Brehna and Wettin. who would certainly never have omitted his own first cousin in the development of his work. In addition, at the time of this writing of the Genealogy, the Abbess of the Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica was Constance, daughter of Ziemomys≈Ç of Kuyavia, and it would be unlikely that she would not have objected to the fact that her paternal aunt was not mentioned in this work. However, if Adelaide was born from the third marriage of Casimir I with Euphrosyne of Opole, she certainly wasn't mentioned in the Genealogii ≈õw. Jadwigi, but instead of Sandomierz, she must to be placed in a monastery located in the domains of her full-brothers. Notes References *Balzer, O (1895). Genealogia Piast√≥w. Krak√≥w. *Jasi≈Ñski, K.

History  The Piyale Pasha Mosque was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan for the vizier and grand admiral Piyale Mehmed Pasha. The mosque was built between 1565 and 1573.  Architecture  A lunette panel with Iznik tiles that may have come from the mosqueUnlike other mosques designed by Sinan that have a large central dome, the Piyale Pasha Mosque is constructed with six identical domes, arranged as two rows of three, each with a diameter of about . It is one of only two mosques in Istanbul with multiple domes, the other being Vasat Atik Ali Pasha Mosque. The domes are supported in the center of the prayer hall by a pair of slender granite pillars. The minaret is placed in the centre of the anti-qibla wall. It was rebuilt in the middle of the 19th century. Around three walls of the interior are a row of Iznik tiles with inscriptions in a white thuluth script on a cobalt-blue background. The interior walls are now whitewashed but they were originally decorated. The stained-glass in the windows of the qibla wall is not original. The domed octagonal mausoleum to the northwest of the mosque contains the tomb of Piyale Pasha together with those of his sons and daughters. Altogether there are thirteen sarcophagi. His wife, Gevherhan Sultan (daughter of Selim II), remarried and is entombed in Selim II's mausoleum next to Hagia Sophia. A number of identical Iznik tiled lunette panels that are now on display in the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris,.. the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon. and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. are believed to have been removed from the Piyale Pasha Mosque in the 19th century. The panels would have been placed above the lower row of windows. Another possibility is that the lunette tiles came from a now demolished kiosk that was associated with the mosque.

She was born in Lawrence, South Otago, New Zealand, on 1 November 1884. Biography Elsie Mary Griffin was married to Cornelius Griffin, a Wesleyan minister. The Griffins moved to Auckland province when she was 16 years old. Elsie Griffin had attended the Methodist Prince Albert College in Queen Street, Auckland, and in 1906 she was awarded an MA with honours in botany from Auckland University College. In that year she took up a position as the botany mistress at Auckland Girls' Grammar School. Elsie Griffin took her pupils on long hikes in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges so that they could collect specimens. She was described as a lively and enthusiastic woman, and characteristics that enabled her to get along with her students successfully. While she was a teacher she became involved with the Young Women's Christian Association in Auckland. In 1908 she helped form a study group composed of university graduates. In 1910 she led a Bible study circle and served on the Evangelistic Committee. She was the secretary of the YWCA in Dunedin from 1912 to 1915, and it was this experience that led her to spend the next two years studying social work methods in America. In 1917 she returned to Auckland to serve as the secretary of the local YWCA.

Of MƒÅori descent, she identified with the NgƒÅi Tahu, NgƒÅti Mutunga and NgƒÅti Tama iwi.  Early life  Grennell was born in Waitangi, Chatham Islands, New Zealand, on 11 February 1910, the eldest of five children. Her father, William Henry Grennell, worked as a farmer and fisherman at Matarakau, Chatham Islands, and was of NgƒÅti Mutunga, NgƒÅti Tama, Irish and American descent. Grennell's mother, Mary Hazel Teripa Tikao, daughter of Hone Taare Tikao and Martha Hana Toku Horomona, was of NgƒÅi Tahu descent. Around 1920, the Grennell family moved to the South Island, and lived in Akaroa and then Koukourarata. Grennell's parents were part of the Koukourarata concert party, run by an aunt, Rahera Tainui. The group performed regularly around Banks Peninsula, and later for servicemen and their families during World War II. Grennell is credited as being the first to sing in te reo MƒÅori on a national radio network in 1927.  Education  Grennell attended Sacred Heart Girls' College, Christchurch, where she developed an appreciation for music. Around the age of 18, Grennell travelled to England to study music professionally, and gained diplomas of licentiateship for musicianship (LTCL and LRSM) in teaching the piano and singing.  Career  = Methodist Home Mission Party (Waiata MƒÅori Choir) = In 1935, Airini and her sister Hinemoa joined the Methodist Home Mission Party (also known as the Waiata MƒÅori Choir), which was established in 1924 by Reverend Arthur John Seamer. The choir consisted of MƒÅori singers and orators, and performed an eclectic repertoire, including religious, popular, indigenous and Western art music. Grennell became known affectionately as the 'Chatham Islands Nightingale' thanks to her talent as a soprano, and she was considered by many to be the leading soprano of the choir. Other members of the choir included Ana Tangaere, Hinemoa Karenera, Sister Olive, Hinerangi Hikuroa, Mereana Kaitaia, Weno Tahiwi, Mihi Waikare, Mori Erihana, Rangipeka Moerua, Marama Muriwai, Mori Pickering (n√©e Ellison), Taka Ropata, Reverend Robert Tahupotiki Haddon, Te Uira Tutaeo Manihera and Inia Te Wiata. The choir toured Australia in December 1935, and England in 1937. The choir was presented to King George VI following his coronation, before disbanding in 1938. = Radio = In October 1938, Grennell joined the radio station 4ZB in Dunedin as a programme assistant. Her 'Songs of the Islands' session in 1940 was very popular. By the end of World War II, Grennell had moved to Auckland where she worked at 1ZB as a programme assistant. By 1939 she had returned to Christchurch, working with both 3YA and 3ZB as an announcer, and at 3YA she helped organise a radio series for women, and initiated a network of women's programming on national radio. While working at 4ZB, Grennell's performance of Songs of the Islands was especially well received. Grennell was the commentator for five royal tours. She continued her broadcasting career until her retirement in 1966.  Personal life  On 11 February 1931, Grennell married Hone Wereta, a farmer of NgƒÅti Raukawa, and they had a daughter later that year. Grennell and Wereta separated during the 1930s. Hone died in March 1958. On 25 November 1958 Grennell married well-known Lithuanian artist Rudolf Gopas, and they had a daughter together. Gopas and Grennell separated in 1976, and Grennell cared for Gopas before his death in 1983.  Retirement and death  Grennell became a respected leader of Horomaka KƒÅi Tahu and Taranaki‚ÄìWharekauri NgƒÅti Mutunga. Grennell's husband and daughter predeceased her, and after her death on 8 December 1988, Grennell's ashes were interred with theirs at the family burial ground at Rapaki.

During transposition, the PB transposase recognizes transposon-specific inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITRs) located on both ends of the transposon vector and efficiently moves the contents from the original sites and integrates them into TTAA chromosomal sites. The powerful activity of the PiggyBac transposon system enables genes of interest between the two ITRs in the PB vector to be easily mobilized into target genomes. The TTAA-specific transposon piggyBac is rapidly becoming a highly useful transposon for genetic engineering of a wide variety of species, particularly insects. Origin The TTAA-specific, short repeat elements are a group of transposons that share similarity of structure and properties of movement. These elements were originally defined in the Cabbage Looper, but appear to be common among other animals as well. They might prove to be useful tools for the transformation of insects. The original identification of these unusual TTAA-specific elements came through a somewhat unconventional route relative to most other Class II mobile elements. Spontaneous plaque morphology mutants of baculoviruses were observed to arise during propagation of these viruses in the TN-368 cell line. Genetic characterization of these mutations often revealed an associated insertion of host-derived DNAs, some of which appeared to be transposons. Several different mobile host DNA insertions have been identified within the few-polyhedra (FP) locus of the baculoviruses AcMNPV and GmMNPV. The insertions most extensively studied are those now designated as tagalong (formerly TFP3) and piggyBac (formerly IFP2). These insertions exhibit a unique preference for TTAA target sites, whether inserting within the viral FP-locus or at other regions of the viral genome. Both of these elements are part of a larger family of TTAA-target site specific insertion elements that includes the T. ni derived piggyBac and tagalong elements, the Spodoptera frugiperda derived elements IFP1.6 and 290 bp insertion of Carstens, and the transposon-like insertion within the EcoRI-J,N region of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, whose origin is undefined. More recently, analysis of sequences obtained from the human genome has revealed what appear to be 100 to 500 copies of a fossil element called LOOPER, which has sequence homology to piggyBac, terminates in 5' CCY....GGG 3', and apparently targets TTAA insertion sites. The LOOPER consensus sequence is on average 77% similar to individual sequences identified in the human genome, indicating it is at least 60 million years old. There are two other TTAA- specific fossil repeat elements, MER75 and MER85 (estimated at 2000 copies per genome) which appear to target TTAA insertion sites and terminate in 5' CCC....GGG 3'. Evidence is accumulating that suggests a superfamily of TTAA- specific mobile elements exists in a diversity of organisms, and that piggyBac-related sequences may be present in a diversity of species.  Structure  The transposon consists of the transposase gene flanked by inverted terminal repeats. The PB superfamily transposase consists of three domains, a variable N-terminal domain, a catalytic DDE triad domain and a C-terminal region with the nuclear localization signal. It has apparently been domesticated in a wide range of animals, losing the repeats and thus its mobility. The new functions these copies gain are sometimes significant enough to show signs of positive or purifying selection. In humans, these genes are: * PBGD1, PBGD2 (mamallian lineage), PBGD3, PBGD4 (primates), PBGD5 (Myomerozoa) As a tool Hyperactive versions of PiggyBac transposase are suited for genetic engineering purposes. A version called mPB was created by optimizing codon usage for mammalian (mouse) with a 20x increase in activity, and further mutation screening generated hyPB with 10x the activity of mPB. Nomenclature These elements were first identified as insertions in Baculovirus mutants by Dr. Malcolm Fraser, professor at the University of Notre Dame, and were originally named as IFP for Insertions in FP mutants. The name was then changed to TFP for Transposon in FP. Finally the name PiggyBac was adopted to keep the interest of the audience and to bear some resemblance to Drosophila gene nomenclature.

She was born in Scotland in 1814 or 1815. She was the daughter of John Ferguson, a carpenter, and his wife, Helen. She married quarryman James Gregg on 8 October 1834, in the parish of East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Emigration to New Zealand On 4 November 1842 Christina and James Gregg arrived in Nelson, New Zealand. Nothing is known of their life in New Zealand until 1849, by which time they had travelled to Canterbury and were living in Lyttelton. Their only son, James, was born two years later. In 1857 James Gregg began farming land he had purchased at Riccarton, and by the following year was employing a farm labourer, Edmund Langstreth. James Gregg was described as \\"a singular specimen of a colonist; shrewd, industrious, comical, and extremely independent\\". James Gregg's death James Gregg died at his Riccarton farm on 11 October 1859 after a brief but violent illness. An inquest held at the Plough Inn, Riccarton, heard that Gregg had been in good health on the evening of 10 October but during the night was seized with \\"violent vomiting and purging\\". Christina Gregg called on Langstreth, who lived in the farmhouse with the family, for assistance, and he went to fetch the doctor from Christchurch. On his arrival the doctor considered the case to be hopeless. A post-mortem analysis of the contents of Gregg's stomach showed the presence of arsenic in sufficient quantity to cause death. At the inquest Christina Gregg stated that her husband had told her he had drunk some beer which disagreed with him. Langstreth made a written statement in which he acknowledged a \\"criminal intimacy\\" with Christina Gregg. The coroner's jury also heard evidence that two months before, James Gregg had complained that he \\"suffered from pain in his inside very much; that he believed something wrong had been given him, and that \\"his missus\\" had done it\\". The jury found Christina Gregg guilty of wilful murder. She was arrested and committed for trial. Edmund Langstreth, although not charged, was also detained. At the Supreme Court trial in Christchurch on 5‚Äì6 December 1859, Christina Gregg pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering her husband. The jury retired for 30 minutes and returned a verdict of not guilty. Later life Despite the notoriety of \\"The Riccarton Poisoning Case\\", Christina Gregg continued to live on the farm at Riccarton. She married Edmund Langstreth, some 20 years her junior, on 14 December 1862 at St Peter's Church, Riccarton. Under the terms of James Gregg's will his estate was to pass to his son, James, on Christina's death or remarriage. Eventually James Gregg brought a court action against his mother and stepfather, claiming the profits of the estate accrued since their marriage. The Langstreths owned over 500 acres of land at Templeton. Langstreth sold 133 acres and paid James Gregg ¬£730. By the end of the 1870s whatever had bound Edmund and Christina Langstreth to each other through criminal and civil proceedings had evidently lost its power. Edmund Langstreth left his wife and went to England. Christina continued farming at Riccarton, where she died on 17 November 1882. Edmund Langstreth remarried in England shortly after her death and did not return to New Zealand.

She was born in Leicestershire, England. The Canterbury Police Gazette of 1 June 1871 describes her as being 5' 4\\", slight build and having sandy hair and grey eyes. Greaves appeared before the Supreme Court four separate times (1862, 1866, 1868 and 1869). This was the highest number of times for a female at that time. Criminality She emigrated to Canterbury New Zealand from Tasmania in 1859. (She had possibly been transported to Tasmania as a criminal.) Her first known court appearance was in 1862.In 1864, she was listed as one of 14 known prostitutes in Christchurch, living in its only known brothel in Kaiapoi. By 1866, she is described as an infamous criminal. Under a period of years, she became well known for appearing in a number of court cases regarding prostitution, robberies, public drunkenness, using obscene language and other crimes. In September that year, Greaves was sentenced to two years imprisonment for assault and robbery on a Thomas Davis. Fellow prostitute Mary Holmes and Charles Yates were also jailed for this incident. In 1869 she took a man outside of the Criterion Hotel and whilst engaged in \\"other matters\\", allegedly rifled his pockets. When the man accused her of theft she struck him and called him a liar. The jury of the Supreme Court found her guilty and the judge told her \\"It is quite evident upon the facts that you are an old and hardened offender. I am sorry to say that both the Magistrate and I know you too well\\" She was sentenced to another two years. Greaves was released from prison on 12 May 1871 after being pardoned. Although released at 4pm, by that evening she had been arrested for being drunk and disorderly and solicitation. Greaves agreed to leave Christchurch after being arrested for soliciting outside the Mitre Hotel in March 1872. She failed to do so and was described as \\"incorrigible\\" and returned to jail. The Contagious Diseases Act 1869 required prostitutes to undergo regular medical examinations. In 1876 she was in court for failing to attend medical examinations and was sent to the Contagious Diseases Reformatory. In 1887 Greaves was fined 30 Shillings for being drunk and disorderly and fighting with another prostitute, Ellen Parkinson. Children Greaves had at least one daughter and possibly at least 3 daughters. One daughter, Catherine, was born in Tasmania and in 1866, when she was 14 years old, appeared in court for a breach of the peace. She subsequently appeared in court many times and jailed for theft and prostitution. An 1867 (when Greaves was in prison) register of prostitutes in Christchurch list a Mary Ann Greaves \\" Of no fixed abode\\" and that \\"Her mother is in prison, the Government support her two sisters\\". This is possibly another daughter of Greaves. Retirement In 1893, Greaves was reported to have retired from criminality, although still listed in that year's register of brothels and described as \\"quiet\\". She was living in Sydenham with 'a notorious thief'. On 18 February 1897 she died of apoplexy.

He was born in Contin, Ross-shire, Scotland on 23 September 1843. William Grant was born on Kirkan farm, in the parish of Contin, Ross-shire, Scotland, on 23 September 1843, the son of Ann Tait and her husband, Donald Grant, a shepherd. With an older brother, Andrew, William set out for New Zealand in 1864 on the Eastern Empire, arriving at Lyttelton in January 1865. On the day they arrived Charles Tripp of Orari Gorge station was at the port looking for shepherds for his run in South Canterbury. Observing a fine-looking sheep-dog with the Grant brothers, and assuming that only good shepherds would bring such a dog with them, he hired both men. Andrew was later appointed manager of Orari Gorge. In addition to wages, William was allowed to run some cattle of his own on part of Orari Gorge. This gave him a start in stock dealing, at which he was to become extremely successful, and he soon progressed into business as a full-time stock dealer. At first he drove cattle to the West Coast to supply beef to goldminers, but he was soon handling large numbers of sheep as well. During the 1870s William made Temuka his headquarters for a stock dealing business which in time extended well beyond Canterbury. His land transactions were complex. With Andrew he bought a farm at Rangitata in the 1870s, and Richmond station at Lake Tekapo in 1880. A year later William purchased the 1,010-acre Elloughton Grange farm, which lay on the outskirts of Timaru, and lived there for the rest of his life. William and Andrew sold Richmond in 1882, and in the same year William sold his interest in the Rangitata farm. In 1883 he bought the Irishman Creek run in the centre of the Mackenzie Country, which he sold again in 1890. Probably to maintain a base for his stock dealings in that area he bought the Grampians run in 1892, which he owned until 1908. In 1902 he had bought Irishman Creek again, as well as the adjoining run, The Wolds. Grant married Elizabeth Helen Allan, the daughter of Robert Allan, a Timaru contractor, near Timaru on 30 April 1884. There were to be three sons and two daughters of the marriage. In 1893 he built The Grange, a two-storeyed, 17-roomed mansion, on Elloughton Grange. It was designed by the French-born Timaru architect Maurice Duval. Grant had new opportunities with the beginning of the frozen-meat trade in the early 1880s. In 1885 the South Canterbury Refrigerating Company, in which Grant had a substantial shareholding, began operating from its Smithfield freezing works at Timaru, a short distance from Elloughton Grange. The company did not buy in stock, but handled consignments on behalf of owners. Filling the need for an on-farm purchaser, Grant was soon buying and supplying large numbers of stock to the works, to the point where he was using its total capacity for four and even five days a week. For a time a substantial part of the frozen meat leaving Timaru, including at least one entire shipload, was owned by William Grant. In his later years, having largely retired from stock dealing, Grant paid all his attention to his land and financial interests. He was by then a very wealthy man, investing most of his fortune in first mortgages, usually to Scots, and often with a genuine helpfulness. William Grant died of a heart attack at Elloughton Grange early in the morning of 5 November 1910. He was buried at Timaru on 11 November. His estate was valued at ¬£208,000. Elizabeth Grant continued to live at The Grange until her death in 1942. A plain, unassuming, good-natured man, said to look rather like King Edward VII, William Grant was respected and well liked. His business acumen and remarkable knowledge of stock made him one of New Zealand's most successful meat operators, and for a long time the country's leading buyer and shipper.

Early life After graduating from Nihon University's College of Art, Matsumoto embarked on a career as an actress, most notably working on the television series Muscle Venus, forming an idol group with fellow cast members Hikaru Shida, Hina Kozuki, Ichiko Mayu, Sachiko Koga, Tomoyo Morihisa, Tsukasa Fujimoto, Yuki Ueda and Yuri Natsume. In 2008, the Muscle Venus group, excluding Kozuki and Natsume, was cast in a film titled Three Count, set in the world of professional wrestling and also starring veteran professional wrestlers Emi Sakura, Kyoko Inoue and Yoshiko Tamura. As part of their roles, all members began training professional wrestling under Sakura. Professional wrestling career =Ice Ribbon (2008‚Äìpresent)= Matsumoto made her debut for Emi Sakura's Ice Ribbon promotion on July 29, 2008, wrestling Yuki Ueda to a three-minute time limit draw.

Matsumoto's wrestling character included her wearing different cosplay outfits, dancing in the middle of matches, intentionally botching spots and other comedic behaviour. Matsumoto gained her first victory on December 13, defeating Chii Tomiya. The following month, despite her unimpressive win-loss record, Matsumoto declared herself the \\"ace\\" of all professional wrestling, before unsuccessfully challenging Kiyoko Ichiki for Ice Ribbon's top title, the ICE√ó60 Championship. The following summer, Matsumoto started a storyline rivalry with International Wrestling Association of Japan manager Haru Miyako, which led to her bringing her associates to face Matsumoto sporadically for the next two years. On December 31, 2009, Matsumoto made her debut for NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling in a three-way match to determine the \\"number one Matsumoto\\". The match, which also included Dump Matsumoto, was won by Hiroyo Matsumoto; none of the three are related to each other.

On May 3, Matsumoto and Kasai, dubbed \\"385Myankie's\\", defeated the defending champions Passion Red (Nanae Takahashi and Kazumi Shimouna) and the team of Gentaro and Keita Yano in a three-way hardcore match to win the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship.

Meanwhile, Matsumoto continued her rivalry with Chii Tomiya, now a member of rival stable Heisei YTR, building to a hardcore match on March 21, 2011, where Matsumoto and Jun Kasai defeated Tomiya and Kazuhiko Ogasawara. After a losing streak, which included several losses against rookie Maki Narumiya, Matsumoto was defeated on May 11 by Emi Sakura 11‚Äì0 in a twenty-minute Iron Man match, which led to Sakura telling her to start improving her game. This led to Matsumoto challenging ICE√ó60 Champion Tsukasa Fujimoto to a title match, where she offered to put her Ice Ribbon career on the line. On May 25, Matsumoto failed in her title match against Fujimoto and, as a result, left Ice Ribbon. Matsumoto in January 2012 Matsumoto then went on to form her own promotion.

In another title match on January 25, Matsumoto was pinned by Neko Nitta, who, as a result, became the new Triangle Ribbon Champion.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1990 through Enigma Records. It was the band's final studio album to include singer/guitarist Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, and the only one to include guitarist Marshall Rohner. Bassist and sole remaining original member Mike Roche left the group after the recording of Strange Love, reuniting with the rest of the original lineup in 1991. Wood and Dean carried on for a few more years with other members, but Strange Love was a commercial disappointment and the band was eventually dropped from Enigma. In 1999 founding members Roche, Jack Grisham, Ron Emory, and Todd Barnes would win back legal rights to the name \\"T.S.O.L.\\" from Wood and relaunch the band, taking it back to its punk rock roots. Background T.S.O.L.'s original lineup of singer Jack Grisham, guitarist Ron Emory, bassist Mike Roche, and drummer Todd Barnes had released two albums and two EPs before Grisham and Barnes left the band in 1983. They were replaced by singer/guitarist Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, and over the course of three studio albums and a live album between 1984 and 1988 the band moved away from the original lineup's hardcore punk sound in favor of gothic rock, hard rock, and glam metal. Emory left the band in 1988 during recording of demos for Strange Love, leaving Roche as the sole remaining original member; Emory has a writing credit on the track \\"Blow by Blow\\". He was replaced by guitarist Scotty Phillips from San Diego, who toured with the band and worked with them on the Strange Love material but left to pursue other musical endeavors; Phillips shares writing credit on three of the album's tracks. Los Angeles guitarist Marshall Rohner replaced him, and the band recorded Strange Love at L.A.'s Sunset Sound Factory and Crystal Sound in September 1989. Roche quit the band prior to Strange Love's May 1990 release. \\"At this point we wondered if we should change the name [of the band]\\", said Dean, \\"We had eaten, shit, pissed, and bled T.S.O.L. for seven years, so didn't that give us a right to keep the name? Hell, yeah. Besides, we had just recorded the best record of our lives and weren't about to roll over and die. We had to tour to support the record.\\" With signed permission from Emory and Roche, the band hired touring bassist Murphy Karges and toured in support of the album from May 1990 to June 1991. Following the tour, Dave Mello joined to fill the bass position. Rohner was unable to continue touring, so Phillips rejoined the band that September. Reception Allmusic biographer Bradley Torreano remarks that by 1990, T.S.O.L. was \\"a hair metal band in every way\\", and that \\"the superficial Strange Love was met with indifferent sales and a shrinking audience, a poor fate for the ailing band\\", attributing Roche's departure to \\"his growing discomfort with the direction of his band\\". Reviewer Alex Henderson rated the album 1¬Ω stars out of 5, saying \\"T.S.O.L. had turned its attention to all- night parties and women in skin-tight dresses and high heels. Compare an early T.S.O.L. recording like 1981's 'Superficial Love' to anything on this CD, and it's hard to believe it's even the same band.\\" However, he found some merit to the record: \\"There were those who cried 'Sellout!', but the fact remains that songs like 'White Lightning', 'Hell on Earth', and 'One Shot Away' are spirited, fun, and entertaining. Though it may not be in a class with AC/DC's Highway to Hell, Strange Love isn't anything to be embarrassed by either.\\" Strange Love ultimately became the final studio album by the hard rock/glam metal incarnation of T.S.O.L. A compilation album, Hell and Back Together: 1984‚Äì1990, was released in 1992, but the band was dropped from Enigma Records' roster and dissolved soon after. Meanwhile, the original T.S.O.L. lineup of Grisham, Emory, Roche, and Barnes had reunited and recorded the live album Live '91. In 1999 they reacquired legal rights to the band's name from Wood and relaunched T.S.O.L. with a return to their original hardcore punk sound.

She was known as 'Dr Doris', famous for her work in rural general practice, for raising the status of obstetrics, improving obstetrics education of medical students and doctors, and working for the welfare of mothers and children.  Early life  Doris Clifton Jolly was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 10 July 1890 emigrating with her family to New Zealand in 1894. She received little primary school education and completed her secondary education in just over one year after deciding to become a medical missionary. She entered medical school at the University of Otago in 1911, graduating in 1916.  Career  On graduation Gordon became a house surgeon at Dunedin Hospital. In 1917 she lectured at the University of Otago, qualified with a Diploma in Public Health and married fellow medical graduate William (Bill) Patteson Pollock Gordon. She decided early in her career to devote herself to country practice. After doing locum work, she and Bill settled in Stratford, Taranaki in 1919 where they ran a general practice and a small private hospital Marire. She became known as 'Dr Doris', synonymous with 'back blocks' (i.e. rural) practice, later publishing two volumes of her autobiography, Backblocks baby-doctor and Doctor down under. Gordon was devoted to midwifery care, in particular safe, pain free childbirth. She pioneered anaesthesia in childbirth or 'twilight sleep' using morphine and scolapine, as well as Caesarian sections. During the 1920s and 1930s Gordon led the medical profession's struggle with the Department of Health for control of obstetrics. She believed all births should take place in hospital and that mothers should be supervised by medical practitioners during pregnancy and postnatally. While she had been opposed to state control in medicine she applauded the Labour government's midwifery service introduced in 1938. The service included free hospital deliveries and 14 days' rest in hospital after the birth. Her commitment to the care of women and children extended to raising the status of obstetrics and improving education of medical students and young specialists. In 1927 she founded the New Zealand Obstetrical Society becoming its secretary. The Society promoted its aims through meetings, lecture tours, scholarships and liaison with the Department of Health. It also protested at midwifery coming under state control. In 1930‚Äì31 she raised money for an endowment to establish a chair in obstetrics at Otago Medical School. In 1938 the Queen Mary Hospital in Dunedin opened providing obstetrical training for medical students. She also saw the need for effective postgraduate training in obstetrics, lobbying for this from 1939. A Postgraduate School of Obstetrics and Gynaecology was set up at Auckland University College in 1947, becoming based at National Women's Hospital in 1964. From 1946‚Äì1948 Gordon became Director of Maternal and Infant Welfare in the Health Department. Doris and Bill Gordon had one daughter and three sons. Her daughter trained as a nurse, two sons Ross Gordon and Graham Gordon became doctors, and their other son Peter Gordon was a politician and cabinet minister.  Awards  In 1925 she became the first woman in Australasia to gain a fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSE). She was elected to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (FRCOG) in 1936, becoming an honorary fellow of the college in 1954. She was the only woman to receive this honour and the only recipient in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1935 she was made an MBE.  Legacy  Gordon campaigned throughout her career for the welfare of mothers and children. She firmly believed in motherhood as women's destiny and the need for women to be content with their maternal lot by making them happy in pregnancy and easing the pain of childbirth. She wished to ‚Äúreconsecrate‚Äù motherhood and campaigned against abortion. Her views on contraception and abortion have been criticised by Margaret Sparrow, a New Zealand reproductive rights advocate and doctor. Sparrow wrote that Gordon's upbringing and personal beliefs meant that she did not challenge the medical profession's negative views of contraception and abortion. She did not accept the advantages of preventing unplanned pregnancies and how birth control could improve the lives of ordinary women. She approved of contraception only if medically necessary. Her attitudes were pronatalist, racist and eugenicist and disapproving of the emancipation of women. Gordon co-authored a book, with Francis Bennett, Gentlemen of the Jury opposing indiscriminate contraception and abortion, though Bennett later distanced himself from the publication. In June 1961 the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society (O&G; Society) and the National Council of Women (NCW) established the Doris Gordon Memorial Trust and Fund to commemorate Gordon's work and to further the study and teaching and practice of obstetrics and gynaecology. During the 1990s, when maternity care was transferred from general practitioners to midwives, the O&G; Society and Doris Gordon Memorial Trust became inactive but the Trust Fund remained. In 2015 the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and NCW formed a new Doris Gordon Memorial Trust to use the funds for an annual Doris Gordon Memorial Lecture. The inaugural lecture was a eulogy to Gordon, delivered by Ron Jones. Margaret Sparrow expressed the view that while Gordon had achieved much for the advancement of maternity services her legacy is flawed and that by opposing contraception and safe legal abortion she had held back advances made to women in England, Europe and America.

He was born in Silut√©, Germany (present day Lithuania) on 13 December 1913. Gopas' works are held in the collections of the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Christchurch Art Gallery and the Hocken Library. His second wife was the radio broadcaster Airini Nga Roimata Grennell.  Early life  Gopas was born in Silut√©, Germany (present day Lithuania) in 1913. His parents were Pranas Gopas, a machinery merchant, and Marte Plauschin. Gopas' birthplace was near Nidden, a fishing village with a popular artists colony.  Education  Gopas studied painting at the School of Fine Arts in Kaunas from 1933 to 1938. While studying, Gopas travelled in Germany, Austria, Italy, Latvia and Greece.  Career  During the occupation of Lithuania by German military during World War II, Gopas served in the German army. He married Natalija (Natascha) Seeberg in 1942, in Ventspils, Latvia, and their daughter Sylvia was born in 1944. When the Russian army invaded later that year, the Gopas family fled to Germany. From 1944-1948, they lived in a refugee camp at Ehrwald, and Gopas made a living producing portrait and landscape paintings. In June 1949, Gopas, his wife, daughter and mother-in-law (Marte Seeberg) travelled to New Zealand on an Irish boat, the Dundalk-Bay, which brought New Zealand Government- assisted immigrants from central and eastern Europe. The family arrived in Wellington on 27 June 1949, and were housed temporarily at the Pahiatua refugee camp. They were resettled in Dunedin, and Gopas found work as a photo- processor with Coulls Somerville Wilkie Limited. Once settled in New Zealand, Gopas began to re-establish himself as a painter. From 1949-1953, Gopas exhibited works at the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts in Wellington, and from 1951, he began to exhibit at the Otago Art Society. In 1951, Gopas and others formed The Independent Group, in response to The Group in Christchurch. Gopas was a regular exhibitor with The Group until its cessation in 1977. In 1953, Gopas left his wife and daughter in Dunedin and moved to Christchurch, where he worked for a photographic firm. He and his wife divorced in 1957. In Christchurch, on 25 November 1958, Gopas married the radio broadcaster Airini Nga Roimata Grennell. Gopas was appointed as a temporary assistant lecturer in painting at the School of Fine Arts, University of Canterbury in 1959, and took up a permanent position in 1960. His students included Philip Trusttum, Philippa Blair, Philip Clairmont, Vivien Bishop, Gavin Bishop, Tony Fomison, John Coley, Barry Cleavin and Kura Te Waru Rewiri. Gopas was considered by his students to be a \\"lively and controversial teacher [...] His reputation was not based so much on his painting as on his ability as a talker about art, and as a stirrer.\\" In 1976, Gopas and his second wife separated, and in 1977 Gopas resigned from his teaching role at the university and travelled to Ehrwald, Austria. He quickly became disillusioned and returned to New Zealand.  Exhibitions  Exhibition of paintings by Rudolf Gopas (1950), at Kendal Nisbet, Dunedin.

Illness and death  After Gopas' return to New Zealand in the late 1970s, his mental health deteriorated and he was committed to Sunnyside Hospital for periodic treatment. Suffering from alcoholism, Gopas' condition deteriorated, and after his circulation became impaired his left leg was amputated above the knee. He made a partial recovery from this surgery before complications arose. On 23 July 1983, two weeks before the scheduled opening of the first exhibition dedicated to his life's work, Gopas died of a heart attack caused by arteriosclerosis, at his home in Christchurch. He was survived by his wife, and his daughter from his first marriage.  Further reading  Rudolf Gopas (1913-1983), MA thesis by J. K. Furniss from the University of Canterbury, 1983.

With the success of the ZX Spectrum from Sinclair Research, Tangerine's backers suggested a home computer and Tangerine formed Oric Products International Ltd to develop the Oric-1. The computer was introduced in 1982. During 1983, approximately 160,000 Oric-1 computers were sold in the UK, plus another 50,000 in France (where it was the year's top-selling machine). This resulted in Oric being acquired and given funding for a successor model, the 1984 Oric Atmos. Oric was bought by Eureka, which produced the less successful Oric Stratos (1985) and Oric Telestrat (1986). Oric was dissolved the year the Telestrat was released. Eastern European clones of Oric machines were produced into the 1990s.  Models  = Oric-1 = Based on a 1 MHz MOS Technology 6502A CPU, the Oric-1 came in 16 KB or 48 KB RAM variants for ¬£129 and ¬£169 respectively, matching the models available for the popular ZX Spectrum and undercutting the price of the 48 KB version of the Spectrum by a few pounds. The circuit design requires 8 memory chips, one chip per data line of the CPU. Due to the sizing of readily available memory chips the 48 KB model has 8 * 8 KB (64 KBit) chips, making a total of 64 KB. As released only 48 KB is available to the user, with the top 16 KB of memory overlaid by the BASIC ROM; The optional disc drive unit contains some additional hardware that allows it to enable or disable the ROM, effectively adding 16 KB of RAM to the machine. This additional memory is used by the system to store the Oric DOS software. Both Oric-1 versions have a 16 KB ROM containing the operating system and a modified BASIC interpreter. The Oric-1 has a sound chip, the programmable General Instrument AY-3-8910. Two graphics modes are handled by a semi-custom ASIC (ULA) which also manages the interface between the processor and memory. The two modes are a \\"LORES\\" (low resolution) text mode (though the character set can be redefined to produce graphics) with 28 rows of 40 characters and a \\"HIRES\\" (high resolution) mode with 200 rows of 240 pixels above three lines of text. Like the Spectrum, the Oric-1 suffers from attribute clash‚Äìalbeit to a much lesser degree in HIRES mode, since 2 different colours can be defined for each 6x1 block of 6 pixels, The system has a built-in television RF modulator as well as RGB output. A standard audio tape recorder can be used for external storage. There is a Centronics compatible printer interface. Technical details * CPU: MOS 6502A @ 1 MHz * Operating system: Tangerine/Microsoft Extended Basic v1.0 * ROM: 16 KB * RAM: 16 KB / 48 KB * Sound: AY-3-8912 * Graphics: 40√ó28 text characters/ 240√ó200 pixels, 8 colours * Storage: tape recorder, 300 and 2400 baud * Input: integrated keyboard * Connectivity: Tape recorder I/O, Centronics compatible printer port, RGB video out, RF out, expansion port * Voltage: 9 V * Power consumption: Max 600 milliamps =Oric Atmos= In late 1983 the funding cost for continued development of Oric caused external funding to be sought, and eventually led to a sale to Edenspring Investments PLC. The Edenspring money enabled Oric International to release the Oric Atmos, which added an improved keyboard and an updated V1.1 ROM to the Oric-1. The faulty tape error checking routine was still there. Soon after the Atmos was released, the modem, printer and 3-inch floppy disk drive originally promised for the Oric-1 were announced and released by the end of 1984. A short time after the release of the Atmos machine, a modification for the Oric-1 was issued and advertised in magazines and bulletin boards. This modification enabled the Oric-1 user to add a second ROM (containing the Oric Atmos system) to a spare ROM-socket on the Oric-1 circuit board. Then, using a switch, the users could then switch between the new Oric Atmos ROM and the original Oric-1 ROM. This was desirable since the updated ROM of the Atmos contained breaking changes for some games which relied on certain behaviours or memory addresses within the ROM. This led to tape based software often containing a 1.1 ROM/Atmos version of the software on one side of the cassette, with a 1.0 ROM/Oric-1 version on the other. Earlier titles where the publisher no longer existed or had stopped producing software for the Oric were unlikely to be updated. =Oric Stratos and Oric Telestrat= Although the Oric Atmos had not turned around Oric International's fortunes, in February 1985, they announced several models including the Oric Stratos/IQ164. Despite their backers putting them into receivership the following day, Oric was bought by French company Eureka, which continued to produce the Stratos, followed by the Oric Telestrat in late 1986. The Stratos and Telestrat increased the RAM to 64 KB and added more ports, but kept the same processor and graphics and sound hardware as the Oric-1 and Atmos. The Telestrat is a telecommunications-oriented machine. It comes with a disk drive as standard, and only connects to an RGB monitor / TV. The machine is backward compatible with the Oric-1 and Oric Atmos by using a cartridge. Most of the software is in French, including Hyper-BASIC's error messages. Up to 6000 units were sold in France. In December 1987, after announcing the Telestrat 2, Oric International went into receivership for the second and final time. Technical specification Controller and DOS architecture for Oric computers =Keyboard= The keyboard has 57 moving keys with tactile feedback. It is capable of full upper and lower case with a correctly positioned space bar. It has a full typewriter pitch. The key layout is a standard QWERTY with ESC, CTRL, RETURN and additional cursor control keys. All keys have auto repeat. =Display= The display adapter will drive a PAL UHF colour or black and white television receiver on approximately Channel 36. RGB output is also provided on a 5 pin DIN 41524 socket. Character mode In character mode the Oric displays 28 lines of 40 characters, producing a display very similar to Teletext. The character set is standard ASCII which is enhanced by the addition of 80 user-definable characters. ASCII characters may also be re-defined as these are down loaded into RAM on power-up. Serial attributes are used to control display features, as in Teletext, and take up one character position. All remaining characters on that line are affected by the serial attribute until either the line ends or another serial attribute. Display features are: * Select background colour (paper) from one of eight. * Select foreground colour (ink) from one of eight. * Flash characters on and off approximately twice a second. * Produce double height characters (even line top, odd line bottom). * Switch over to user definable characterset. This feature is used to produce Teletext style colour graphics which does not require any additional RAM to operate. Available colours are black, blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, yellow, and white. Each character position also has a parallel attribute, which may be operated on a character by character basis, to produce video inversion. The display has a fixed black border. Screen graphics mode The graphics mode consists of 200 pixels vertically by 240 pixels horizontally plus 3 lines of 40 characters (the same as character mode) at the bottom of the screen to display system information and to act as a window on the user program while still viewing the graphics display. It can also be used to input direct commands for graphics and see the effect instantly without having to switch modes. The graphics display operates with serial attributes in the same way as characters, except that the display is now considered as 200 lines by 40 graphics cells. Each graphic cell is therefore very flexible by having 8 foreground and 8 background colours and flashing patterns. The video invert parallel attribute is also usable in this mode. ASCII characters may be painted over the graphics area, thus enabling the free mixing of graphics and text. =Sound= The Oric has an internal loudspeaker and amplifier and can also be connected to external amplifiers via the 7 Pin DIN 45329 shared with the cassette interface. A General Instruments AY-3-8912 provides 3 channel sound. For BASIC programs, four keywords generate pre-made sounds: \`PING\`, \`SHOOT\`, \`EXPLODE\`, and \`ZAP\`. The commands \`SOUND\`, \`MUSIC\`, and \`PLAY\` produce a broader range of sounds. =Cassette interface= The cassette recorder connects via a 7 Pin DIN 45329 socket shared with the external sound output. The interface includes support for tape motor control. Recording speeds offered as standard are 300 baud or 2400 baud. A tone leader allows tape recorders' automatic level control to stabilise before the filename, followed by the actual data with parity; finally, checksums are recorded to allow overall verification of the recording. The circuit was designed using a Schmitt trigger to remove noise and make input more reliable. The system allows for verification of stored information against the tape copy, to ensure integrity before the information is flushed from memory. There was however a bug within the error-checking of recorded programs, often causing user-created programs to fail when loaded back in, this bug persist in the updated roms for the Oric Atmos. Available basic commands are CLOAD, CSAVE (for programs and memory dumps), STORE, RECALL (for arrays of string, integer or real, added with Oric Atmos roms). Filenames up to 16 characters can be specified. Options on the commands exist for slow speed, verification, autorunning of programs or specification of start and ending addresses for dumping memory. =Expansion port = The expansion port allows full access to the CPU's data address and control lines. This allows connection of add-ons specifically designed for the Oric, including user designed hardware. The range of lines exposed allows external ROM and RAM expansion, thus allowing for rom cartridges or for expansion devices to internally include the required operating software on ROM. =Printer port= The printer port is compatible with the then standard Centronics parallel interface allows for connection of many different types of printers from low quality (e.g. low-resolution thermal printers) to high quality printers, such as fixed font daisy wheel printers or laser printers, though the latter were uncommon and expensive during the period of commercial availability of the Oric range. Most contemporary computer printers could produce text output without requiring specific drivers, and often followed de facto standards for simple graphics. More advanced use of the printer would have required a specific driver which, given the proliferation of different home computers and standards of the time, may or may not have been available. Peripherals =Colour plotter= Tangerine's MCP-40 is a plotter with mechanics by Alps Electric. The same mechanism was also used as the basis for similar low-cost plotters produced by various home computer manufacturers around that time. These included the Atari 1020, the Commodore 1520, the Tandy/Radio Shack CGP-115, the Texas Instruments HX-1000, the Mattel Aquarius 4615, and probably also the Sharp MZ-1P16 (for MZ-800 series). =Prestel adaptor= The Prestel adaptor produced by Eureaka (Informatika) was the first adaptor produced for the Oric-1 and Oric Atmos computers. However this adaptor was only furnished with very limited software. Clones The Atmos was licensed in Yugoslavia and sold as the Nova 64. The clones were Atmos based, the only difference being the logo indicating ORIC NOVA 64 instead of Oric Atmos 48K. This is to indicate the installed 64 KB of RAM, which was also true of the Atmos; In both 16 KB of which is masked by the ROM at startup, leaving 48 KB to work with the BASIC language. Pravetz 8D In Bulgaria, the Atmos clone was named Pravetz 8D and produced between 1985 and 1991. The Pravetz is entirely hardware and software compatible with the Oric Atmos. The biggest change on the hardware side is the larger white case that hosts a comfortable mechanical keyboard and an integrated power supply. The BASIC ROM has been patched to host both a Western European and Cyrillic alphabet the upper case character set produces Western European characters, while lower case gives Cyrillic letters. In order to ease the use of the two alphabets, the Pravetz 8D is fitted with a Caps Lock key. A Disk II compatible interface and a custom DOS, called DOS-8D, were created in 1987‚Äì88 by Borislav Zahariev.

When the strike began on 9 January 1972, it was generally considered that the miners \\"could not possibly win.\\" Woodrow Wyatt, writing in the Daily Mirror, said: \\"Rarely have strikers advanced to the barricades with less enthusiasm or hope of success... The miners have more stacked against them than the Light Brigade in their famous charge.\\" The picketing of the fuel depot ‚Äì out of which tens of thousands of tons of coke were being distributed nationwide ‚Äì became a pivotal, and symbolic, event during the strike. Forcing its closure secured victory for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Having closed every coal mine in the country, the miners' union sought to leverage its position by 'freezing' existing stockpiles of fuel in place, preventing them from being transported to the power stations, businesses and heavy industries that depended on them. By the beginning of February, the tactic was becoming effective and the Central Electricity Generating Board warned that power outages were imminent. The \\"last large accessible\\" stockpile of solid fuel in the country was held by a West Midlands Gas Board (WMGB) coke plant in Birmingham, where up to 700 vehicles were collecting fuel each day for supply to industry. WMGB argued that as they employed no miners they were not a party to the dispute and so should be allowed to continue supplying their customers. When news of mile-long queues of lorries waiting to collect fuel was published on 3 February in the Birmingham Mail, a small group of miners from nearby Staffordshire set up a picket line at the works. Their numbers proved ineffectual at persuading the lorry drivers to turn back, and Birmingham City Police sent hundreds of officers to ensure the depot gates were kept open. Within days, the Staffordshire pickets' request for assistance was answered by several thousand miners from South Yorkshire and South Wales. By 10 February, the number of pickets and protesters, bolstered by the arrival of unionised workers from other Birmingham industries, had reached upwards of 15,000, and Sir Derrick Capper, the Chief constable of Birmingham City Police, ordered the depot to close its gates \\"in the interests of public safety.\\" The picketing and closure of the depot has been called \\"the miners' Agincourt\\", and brought one of its architects, Arthur Scargill ‚Äî until then, \\"an obscure regional union official\\" ‚Äî to national prominence as \\"a tribune of the working classes... hailed by Harper's & Queen as one of Britain's leaders of the future.\\" Background The national strike by coal miners began on 9 January 1972. It was the first official national miners' strike since the General Strike in 1926. The dispute arose from pay negotiations ‚Äì the miners, led by Joe Gormley, initially asked for pay rises of between 35‚Äì47%, while the National Coal Board (NCB), under Derek Ezra, was only prepared to offer 7.4%. All 289 coal mines in the country ceased production. At the beginning of the strike, it was estimated that there were sufficient stockpiles of fuel to supply national requirements for about 8 weeks. However, the stockpiles were unevenly distributed around the country and fuel was \\"not necessarily at the places where it was needed.\\" Within days of the strike commencing, the Miners' International Federation and the International Transport Workers' Federation had asked their members to block any strike-breaking movements of coal and coke into and across Britain, and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) was asked to convene a meeting of transport unions to ensure that stockpiles were not transported out of collieries. The National Union of Railwaymen instructed its members not to cross picket lines, not to operate trains carrying fuel and \\"not to do anything that could be construed as strike-breaking\\". On 11 January, the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers instructed its members to cease working at collieries, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen instructed its members not to operate trains carrying fuel. With the collieries successfully closed, the miners were now able to focus their efforts on picketing coal-fired power stations, docks and fuel storage depots. Dockworkers were backing the miners by refusing to unload ships carrying coal, and vessels carrying coal destined for power stations were turned away at Cardiff and Middlesbrough docks in the first week of the strike. Schools and private businesses, which due to their limited storage capacities tended not to stockpile large amounts of fuel, also began to close within the first week, unable to provide heating. Under guidelines agreed between the NUM, the NCB and the government, dispensation was given to allow fuel to be transported to \\"priority consumers\\" ‚Äì hospitals, nursing homes for the elderly, and orphanages. Schools were added to the list on 12 January. On 7 February, four weeks into the strike, the effective blockade placed on fuel stockpiles led to the CEGB cutting the voltage across the National Grid and warning of impending power outages. The problem of unevenly distributed stockpiles had been compounded by the refusal of transport workers carrying the \\"lighting-up\\" oil (used to ignite damp pulverised coal) and hydrogen (used to cool generators) to cross picket lines, and at least three power stations which still held reserves of coal had already shut down. A spokesman for the CEGB declared: \\"We are in a state of siege\\". =Death of Fred Matthews= The picketing was largely without incident and relations between pickets and police were good. Reginald Maudling, the Home Secretary, accepted that, despite exceptional instances of disorder, \\"the bulk of the picketing that has taken place has certainly been peaceful.\\" Where police and pickets did clash, the confrontations were characterised as \\"scuffles\\", amounting to \\"spirited pushing and shoving.\\" However, tension between pickets and strike-breaking lorry drivers rose on 3 February when Fred Matthews, a miner from the Doncaster area, was struck and killed by a lorry speeding out of Keadby Power Station, near Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. Matthews was one of 50 miners manning the picket line. The lorry mounted the pavement, \\"scattering pickets\\", and failed to stop after hitting Matthews. Police officers on duty at the picket line had to use cars belonging to miners to pursue the lorry, and brought it to a halt around a mile from the scene of the incident. As news of Matthews' death began to spread that evening, Tom Swain, the MP for Derbyshire North East, demanded that the Home Secretary return to Parliament immediately to make a statement. Swain warned: \\"If there is not an immediate statement by the minister I will go back to my constituency tonight and advocate violence, violence, violence.\\" Members of print union the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants 'downed tools' and halted production of national newspapers for an hour in protest at Matthews' death. When the Home Secretary returned to Parliament late that night to address the House, Shirley Williams, the Shadow Home Secretary, demanded to know what instructions were being given to strike-breaking drivers and urged the government to intervene in the dispute between the miners and the NCB \\"before it was too late.\\" Nechells gas works Although the confrontation has come to be known as the \\"Battle of Saltley Gate\\", the picketed depot was located in the adjacent ward of Nechells. Robert Kellaway said: \\"Many commentators have discussed the mythology surrounding the \\"Battle of Saltley Gate\\" yet its most obvious myth ‚Äì its name ‚Äì has often been overlooked. The confrontation actually took place at the gate for Nechells gas works. The Saltley gas works and its \\"gates\\" were on the other side of the Saltley Viaduct adjacent to the Nechells works. As local trade unionist Bill Shreeve declared, \\"The press and the media kept insisting on calling it Saltley Gate and that's gone down in the history books.\\"\\" Don Perrygrove, a local union official, said: \\"Next to Saltley gas works there's also a locality where there used to be a tollgate, and that is called \\"Saltley Gate\\" and when people were trying to close the gas works... they assumed that it was one and the same.\\" Nechells gas works produced coke as a by-product from the manufacture of coal gas. It was owned and operated by the West Midlands Gas Board. Prior to the strike, the coke was sold largely to schools and hospitals, and a former manager of the depot described its normal operations as \\"three lorries a day at most\\". After the strike was announced, demand increased sharply and the depot began receiving up to 400 vehicles per day. By February, around 30,000 tons of coke had been collected and the stockpile was estimated to hold 100,000 tons. The number of collections had increased to around 700 per day, and traffic around the depot was being disrupted by the queues, up to a mile long, of lorries waiting to get in. Impact The success of the NUM pickets at Saltley Gate was promoted by Arthur Scargill and many of his supporters as the decisive victory in the 1972 strike and evidence of the effectiveness of solidarity strikes and mass picketing. However, Frank Walters has argued that victory was likely even without the success at Saltley Gate,The Saltley Incident, A Report by FL Ffoulkes, British Gas Corporation, March 1985 in and Paul Routledge has argued that, in the long-term, the actions were counter-productive by prompting the Conservative Party to adopt a more adversarial attitude towards strikes. The Battle of Orgreave was the state's response in the 1984 miners' strike to mass picketing.

Jack Briggs (8 April 1916 ‚Äì 1 June 1984) was an English cricketer. Briggs was a right-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Haslingden, Lancashire. Briggs made his first-class debut for Lancashire against Leicestershire in the 1939 County Championship. He made three further first- class appearances for the county in that season, the last of which came against Derbyshire, with the onset of World War II prematurely ending his first-class career. In his four first-class appearances for Lancashire, he took 10 wickets at an average of 39.10, with best figures of 4/48. With the bat, he batted just twice, ending each innings not out on 0. Following the war, he made eight Minor Counties Championship appearances for Cheshire in 1948. He played for Haslingden Cricket Club in the Lancashire League from 1933 to 1957. He died at Rawtenstall, Lancashire, on 1 June 1984.

It is an administrative division of the Church of England Diocese of Exeter and under the oversight of the Bishop suffragan of Plymouth. History The first recorded archdeacon of Exeter occurs in 1083, around the time when archdeacons were first appointed in Britain. Around that time, the Diocese of Exeter was divided into four archdeaconries: Exeter, Cornwall, Totnes (or Totton) and Barnstaple (or Barum). This configuration of archdeaconries within the diocese remained for almost 800 years, until the creation of the independent Diocese of Truro from the Cornwall archdeaconry. On 22 March 1918, the archdeaconries were reconfigured and the Archdeaconry of Plymouth created from Totnes archdeaconry. Presently, the diocese operates an informal 'area scheme' such that responsibility for roughly half the diocese is delegated to each suffragan bishop: special oversight is given to the Bishop of Crediton for the Barnstaple and Exeter archdeaconries and to the Bishop of Plymouth for the Plymouth and Totnes archdeaconries.Diocese of Exeter ‚Äì Vacancy in the Suffragan See of Crediton The archdeacon oversees the deaneries of Moreton, Newton Abbot and Ipplepen, Okehampton, Torbay, Totnes and Woodleigh, in Devon, southwest England.

In the episode, Weaver leads several squads of fighters to attack the aliens and Tom remains behind to help protect the civilians as they evacuate the school. The episode was well received by television critics, with many praising the final scene. It was watched by 5.6 million viewers, the highest rated episode since the series premiere; with 2.5 million viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Rick runs off to rejoin the Skitters and meets Megan, whose body is slowly changing under the influence of the harness. Speaking for the Skitters, she promises to lead him to them if he tells her everything he knows about the 2nd Mass. However, after doing this, she departs, leaving him feeling betrayed by the Skitters. On learning that the Skitters know the whereabouts of the 2nd Mass, Tom decides to evacuate the civilians while leaving a small force behind. While Weaver's strike team are away, the 2nd Mass comes under attack from Skitter Mechs, but Scott and Ben save the day by finding and transmitting the right frequency to confuse the aliens. Many Mechs are destroyed using the new armor-piercing Mech-metal tipped rounds. For the first time, the aliens retreat in the face of human resistance. When neither the 4th nor 5th Mass. militias arrive by the designated time, and are presumed destroyed, Weaver believes that his attack will turn into a suicide mission, but they still have to try. Weaver sends Hal back to the 2nd Mass to report the tactical situation, and to tell everyone that the fighters of the 2nd Mass. went down fighting. Returning to the strike force, Tom finds that it was decimated without the expected reinforcements. He finds Pope caring for a wounded Anthony, and tells him to carry him back to base. As Pope leaves, he presents Tom with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, equipped with a special grenade that he encased entirely in Mech-metal. Tom then finds Weaver, unconscious in a crashed truck. As they approach the Skitters' base, both realize the hopelessness of achieving the mission, and as a \\"send-off\\" Tom randomly shoots a Skitter airship with the special RPG. However, because the airship had been making an approach to land, its wreck crashes into the Skitter's hangar deck, setting off a chain reaction of secondary explosions in fuel and munitions stored there, culminating in a spectacular explosion that severely damages the structure. Shocked, both men flee the city. On the way back to the 2nd Mass Tom and Weaver are blocked by Karen who has been captured and now wears a harness. She tells them the aliens had not expected such a high level of resistance and this had intrigued them; they want to talk. Weaver and Tom are furious that the aliens have the nerve to try negotiation after everything they have done now that Earth is proving not the easy target they thought. An alien ship lands and Tom is asked to come aboard. He agrees only after being told it is the only way to save Ben from the transition that is befalling him. The episode ends with Tom taking Karen's hand and leaving a shocked Weaver behind.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1991 through Triple X Records. It marked a reunion of the band's original lineup of singer Jack Grisham, guitarist Ron Emory, bassist Mike Roche, and drummer Todd Barnes. At the time, the rights to the name \\"T.S.O.L.\\" were held by Joe Wood and Mitch Dean, who had replaced Grisham and Barnes in 1984 and taken the band in a glam metal direction. Wood legally prevented the original members from using the name for their reunion, so they were billed by their four full names and Live '91 does not carry the name T.S.O.L. on its packaging. Background T.S.O.L.'s original lineup of singer Jack Grisham, guitarist Ron Emory, bassist Mike Roche, and drummer Todd Barnes had released two albums and two EPs before Grisham and Barnes left the band in 1983. They were replaced by singer/guitarist Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, and over the course of four studio albums between 1984 and 1990 the band moved away from the original lineup's hardcore punk sound in favor of hard rock and glam metal. Emory left the band in 1988, and Roche followed suit in 1990. Wood and Dean retained legal rights to the name T.S.O.L., and continued the band for a few more years with replacement members. Meanwhile, Grisham formed the keyboard-driven Cathedral of Tears and then the blues rock- influenced Tender Fury. Barnes, in and out of jail during the 1980s, played on the first Tender Fury album but had difficulty playing the kick drum due to years of injecting amphetamines into his leg. After Emory and Roche quit T.S.O.L., the four founding members reconvened for a one-night reunion. Wood served legal papers on them to prevent them from using the name T.S.O.L., forcing them to bill themselves by their four full names. For subsequent shows they would sometimes bill themselves as \\"T.S.O.L.: The Original Members\\". For a time, both incarnations of the band were active, sometimes playing the same cities on the same nights. Further complicating the matter was the fact that Grisham and Wood were brothers-in-law, Wood having married Grisham's sister. Live '91 was recorded at Raji's in Hollywood and released through Triple X Records. The photograph used for the cover, taken by Edward Colver a decade earlier, is the same one used for the band's 1981 debut EP, but given a sepia tone rather than the high-contrast solarisation treatment used for the EP. Because they did not have the rights to use the name T.S.O.L., the band's name does not appear on the album packaging. Instead, it bears the four members' full names. The T.S.O.L. reunions were ultimately short-lived; the members' drug habits kept them from performing regularly. Emory did heroin, while Roche descended into poverty and drug dealing. Grisham continued with music, forming The Joykiller in 1995, which initially included Emory. Following the punk rock revival of the 1990s, the original T.S.O.L. members overcame their drug habits and fought a legal battle with Wood, reacquiring rights to the band's name in 1999. Barnes died in 2000 and the band continued on with other drummers, releasing new albums in the punk rock style.

The screenplay is by Phoebe Ephron and Henry Ephron, based on a story by Norman Krasna, and is a remake of The Richest Girl in the World (1934). Plot Home from the war, Captain Tony Travis (Alan Marshal) eyes an estate in Santa Barbara and wonders what it must be like to be that rich. It is the property of the fabulously wealthy Nora Hunter (Laraine Day), who has secretary and friend Sylvia Lockwood (Marsha Hunt) impersonate her in public. Longtime guardian Jonathan Connors (Edgar Buchanan) protects his ward's privacy zealously. During a ship launching, a press photographer takes Nora's picture, but Connors sees to it that the camera film is ruined. Sylvia tells Nora that she is quitting so that she can accompany her husband, Phil Vernon (Allyn Joslyn), whose job requires him to move to Washington. Nora decides to marry her fianc√© Donald (William Post Jr.) so that Sylvia can be her maid of honor at her wedding. But when Donald returns from military duty, he breaks the news that he has fallen in love with someone else. Nora hosts a tea, but has Sylvia again pretend to be her. There she meets and takes a liking to Tony, but he is more interested in Sylvia. On hearing him vow that love is more important to him than money, Nora and Sylvia invite him to a weekend at Nora's beach house. Nora helps Tony court Sylvia, so that if he does genuinely love the real Nora, it will not be because of her money. All of her friends tell her she is being foolish, that nobody can resist that much temptation, but she stubbornly persists. Mix-ups ensue. While tipsy, Sylvia accepts a marriage proposal from Tony. That night, Tony sees Phil sneak to Sylvia's bedroom for a late night hug. The next morning, he punches the overly cheerful Phil over it. Nora tells him that she and Sylvia switched rooms that night. Despite this \\"confession\\", he eventually realizes who he really loves, tosses the protesting Nora over his shoulder and carries her away to get married. On their honeymoon night in a cheap motel, Nora finally reveals her true identity. Tony is disgusted and starts to leave, but then sees her for the first time in her nightgown and stays.

Bert Gance produced it at RKO. In December 1943 Hedda Hopper reported that two stars under contract to David O Selznick, Dorothy McGuire and Alan Marshall would work for RKO on a film the following year ‚Äì possibly The Fair Barbarian or The Flashing Stream. In January 1944 RKO announced they were going to make a marital comedy I Married the Navy written by Emmett Lavery, who was to co produce with Val Lewton. It would be directed by Richard Wallace and star Marshall and McGuire. In March 1944 RKO announced they had postponed I Married a Navy due to McGuire's refusal to make it. They substituted it on the studio's schedule with That Hunter Girl which was to star Marshall and Laraine Day and be directed by Wallace. Producer Bert Gance borrowed Henry and Phoebe Ephron from Fox to rewrite the script ‚Äì not to change the structure but to 'jazz it up\\". The Ephrons had never written a full script before ‚Äì Fox hired them off the back of the success of a play they had written ‚Äì so they asked a secretary who had been the best screenwriter to ever work at the studio; she said Norman Krasna. They got every Krasna script they could and copied how he did his scripts. When they started writing the star was going to be Dorothy McGuire but she was replaced shortly before production by Laraine Day. Henry Ephron said they \\"had written the part for McGuire's original and somewhat eccentric style (she hardly ever came through the front door; she always climbed in through the window)\\" but felt Day was \\"fine. A good enough actress and quite beautiful.\\" Laraine Day and Marsha Hunt were borrowed from MGM, Alan Marshall was borrowed from David O. Selznick, Allyn Jolson was borrowed from 20th Century Fox and Edgar Buchanan was borrowed from Columbia. Filming started in March 1944. The film was called That Hunter Girl but the title was changed to Bride By Mistake in May 1944. Day said she liked making the movie \\"tremendously. It was the first film designed to make audience laugh for which I had been chosen. I'm hoping this will exert and new and beneficial influence.\\" Reception The film made a profit of $600,000.Richard B.

Early life Bridget Goodwin was born in Ireland, possibly in Dublin, some time between 1802 and 1827. Her parents' names are unknown. She had little or no education; according to the reminiscences, she was unable to read or write. She mined first at Bendigo and Ballarat in Australia and then sailed for New Zealand, arriving at Nelson in the mid 1860s. She mined in the Collingwood area and then, after a long overland trek to the West Coast, in the vicinity of the Buller River. Career Bridget Goodwin lived and worked with two male goldminers. The threesome came from Australia to New Zealand together. Bridget Goodwin was a small woman, about four feet in height and of slight build. Nevertheless, she was capable of hard physical work. Gold prospecting involved scooping up, cradling and panning sands from river and stream beds. Often it was necessary to work standing in the water for hours on end. She coped with this, and also directed the work of the two men, who appear to have accepted her leadership. The three of them did not apparently make much money from gold prospecting. Whatever was left after the necessities had been bought was spent on drinking sprees. Old Biddy There is some evidence that Bridget Goodwin and her companions settled in a hut not far from the Lyell township and mined close to Lyell in the 1880s and early 1890s. During this period the two men died. The man who survived longer is said to have been called 'Old Bill'. On the other hand, a poem entitled 'Biddy of the Buller', by the popular West Coast poet Hugh Smith, who moved from Ahaura to Reefton the year before Bridget Goodwin died, gives the name of her male companion as 'Jack'. After the death of her second companion, in Reefton hospital, Bridget Goodwin settled in Reefton, where she spent the remainder of her life. At this stage she became known as 'Old Biddy' or 'Old Biddy of the Buller'. She was admitted to Reefton hospital at least twice during the late 1890s. During her Reefton residence, Bridget Goodwin was an Anglican and received regular visits from fellow parishioners, whom she entertained with stories of her early life. Death She died at Reefton on 19 October 1899. Her age at death was variously given as 72, 86 and 96 years. Popularity Bridget Goodwin seems to have been an enthusiastic pipe-smoker, and had a well-developed taste for alcohol. By Victorian standards, her morals were somewhat questionable. Yet her reputation for hard work under conditions of enormous hardship, for hospitality, for loyalty to her companions, and, strangely enough, for cleanliness, seems to have won her the affection and respect of contemporaries.

It was closed when passenger services were withdrawn in 1966. The station building today is used as commercial premises. History =Great Western Railway= The railway first was first opened by the GWR who opened its single platform station on 1 January 1849 on a branch from Gobowen. Under the Railway Act 1921, the CR was allocated to the GWR. The GWR immediately closed its competing station on 7 July 1924 and diverted all services to either pass through or terminate at the adjacent former Cambrian Railways station. The main GWR service integrated was the shuttle to Chester via Gobowen on the Shrewsbury & Chester Railway. The GWR immediately made the CR/LNWR engine shed its divisional base for the new Oswestry locomotive division, allocating it code: OSW. In 1929, the GWR improved the facilities, adding electric lighting to the entire complex, extra inspection pits, and a GWR standard-pattern single-ramp coaling stage. A further improvement programme occurred in 1939, when the wooden roof was replaced with steel trusses, allowing the introduction of improved clearances, increased ventilation and additional glass shuttering. An administrative oddity occurred throughout the period of control by the GWR, in that a singular ex-LNWR engine was stabled but not allocated to Oswestry shed from 1923, only attached to the shed after 1946 when the UK railway system was nationalised under British Railways. =Cambrian Railways= Proposed to be formed from the amalgamation of a series of local regional railway companies, as a result the new company called Cambrian Railways (CR) proposed to base its headquarters in Oswestry. Using existing Parliamentary Act approval for development of a station, it proposed to build closer to the centre of the town than the existing Great Western Railway (GWR) station, which had opened in 1849. On completion, the CR station would complete the mainline for the London and North Western Railway, from Whitchurch on the Crewe and Shrewsbury Railway, to Welshpool in Mid-Wales. The first connection to the station was made from the south by the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, which operated its first train on 1 May 1860. After a legal tussle between the two competing companies, LNWR and GWR, Parliament authorised building the CR/LNWR sponsored line to Whitchurch in August 1861, driven by the need to regenerate Ellesmere. However, the proposed route was heavily fought over by land owners, with the eventual tracks running via Fenn's Moss, requiring additional civil engineering, support and drainage to overcome the local bog conditions. On 25 July 1864 the CR was formally created, allowing the first CR train to the run from Whitchurch into Oswestry two days later on 27 July 1864. =Facilities= The station consisted of two main platforms, which each had two bays either end, creating a total of six platforms: one main up, one main down, two bays up, two bays down. Built to standard gauge, there was an allowance to build a third freight-bypass track down the middle of the running road, which was completed later by the GWR in 1923. The station building was designed by a local architect in keeping with CR constituent design philosophies, but was substantial and included a great deal of office accommodation and a Boardroom. This was to allow, once the first CR train had run into the station from the north, the CR to formally move its headquarters and administration base to the station building. After the station opened, the CR demolished the temporary wooden 2-road O&NR; shed, located just north in the fork between the GWR junction to Gobowen and the CR mainline to Whitchurch. Designed, engineered and hence based on standard LNWR practice, when completed it comprised: 4-road running shed; 2-road lifting shed; turntable; coal tip; plus associated offices and mess rooms. On the opposite side of the tracks, the CR later built its own railway works. Its construction of 22 locomotive roads and an 11 carriage and wagon works sidings, hastened Oswestry's boom as a railway town: from a population of 5,500 in 1861; to nearly 10,000 40 years later. A war memorial, designed by Allan G Wyon, to 53 CR employees who died serving in World War I was erected after the war and stood in the station until after its final closure (1971) when, in 1975, Oswestry Town Council moved it into the Cae Glas Park where it stands today. Closure In 1963, the station was reallocated to become part of the London Midland Region. In the review under the Beeching Axe the Cambrian Railways line from Whitchurch to Welshpool was decreed surplus to demands, and listed for closure. On 18 January 1965, passenger services to Welshpool and Whitchurch finished, and the locomotive shed closed. A shuttle service to Gobowen operated by Diesel Multiple Units continued until 7 November 1966 when both the station closed to passengers and the works closed. Freight services continued to run until 1971, but following this much of the station was demolished, to leave only the main building. A single line from Gobowen through the station to Llanyblodwel quarry was used by freight trains until 1988 but since closure the track has remained in place . Present =Private ownership= The station was sold in the 1980s to local businessman Den Hinton and became Oswestry DIY & Home Centre. The offices and former Cambrian Railways boardroom on the first floor were converted into eight flats and two bedsits. The ground floor was opened up to form a large retail area and the rear platform was enclosed to provide storage. The building was sold to Owens Motor Factors in 1993 who renamed their car parts business Cambrian Autoparts. During their redevelopment of the car park adjoining the building (which covered the land that previously carried the Oswestry to Gobowen line) a large air raid shelter was uncovered which had tunnels running off it to the old railway works. In the late 1990s the site was purchased by Tesco with the aim of developing a supermarket on the land behind the station and using the original station building as the frontage and entrance foyer which would incorporate small, specialist retail units. After a fierce (and controversial) planning battle, permission was refused and the site remained empty until its purchase by the local authority in 2005. =Cambrian Heritage Railways= The single railway track still runs through the station, and is the subject of a plan by Cambrian Heritage Railways (CHR) to reopen the line between Oswestry and Llanyblodwel, and eventually to Gobowen to reconnect with the mainline. CHR has agreed leases with Shropshire County Council for an section of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway between Gobowen and Blodwel. The lease runs for 50 years from 2014. On 17 August 2014, Beyer Peacock 0-4-0ST No. 1827 hauled the first steam passenger services from Oswestry for the first time since January 1965. Passengers were carried in the CHR's brake van over the first half-mile of track towards Gobowen. =T&WA; Order= The CHR applied for a Transport & Works Act Order for transfer of NR's residual rights to itself and this was granted on 28 February 2017. This permits the CHR to reopen the route from Gobowen to Blodwel Quarry subject to level crossings of the A5 and A483 being replaced by a tunnel and overbridge respectively.DfT TWAO Decision letter Cambrian Railways Museum The station's former goods depot now serves as the Cambrian Railways Museum.

Currently, AM3 serves approximately 50,000 revenue generating units (RGUs) in over 450 properties. AM3 also conducts business as Upstream Network, in an effort to distance itself from the tarnished Access Media 3 branding. History Access Media 3 was founded by CEO Scott Rediger in January 2007 in a merger with MDI Access. Rediger's previous experience in the telecom industry included his role as a co-founder of Ovation Communications, a competitive local exchange carrier business offering facility-based local, long distance, and data services to medium and large sized businesses in the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Milwaukee and Detroit. After two years, Ovation Communications was sold to McLeod USA in 1999 for $402 million. After the sale, Rediger served as a Senior Vice President of Products and Development for McLeod USA. AM3's business model specifically targeted multi-unit residential buildings as a market for customized bundled media services. The company works directly with property owners, associations and managers to design individualized packages of high-speed internet, voice and television from DIRECTV‚Ñ¢. AM3 expanded rapidly through both organic sales growth and strategic acquisitions.

It was recorded on May 25, 1977, at the Mosque in Richmond, Virginia, and contains the complete concert from that date. It was released on February 1, 2012. The album is the first in the Dave's Picks series of Grateful Dead archival releases, the successor to the Road Trips series. It is a limited edition of 12,000 individually numbered copies. The cover art, by Scott McDougall, depicts the hands of two skeletons in outer space, with clashing drumsticks that resemble lightsabers. This is a nod to the film Star Wars, which was released the same date that the concert was recorded. Critical reception In All About Jazz, Doug Collette wrote, \\"Though its graphic design and packaging is markedly different than its immediate predecessor of Grateful Dead archive releases, the initial release in Dave's Picks follows proudly in the tradition of the recently concluded Road Trips (as well as the original series to which this one's title refers, Dick's Picks). Overseen by David Lemieux, chief archivist and co-producer of the previous line, as well as the most recent one-off Grateful Dead titles such as Europe '72 Volume 2... the legacy of this iconic band is in the most capable of hands.... The set list is a blueprint for the slow but sure expansion of the musicianship from tight ensemble work (\\"Mississippi Half Step Uptown Toodleoo\\"), slightly looser interplay (\\"They Love Each Other\\"), the initial group jams apart from solos (\\"Lazy Lightning\\" > \\"Supplication\\") and the segue that opens them up full- throttle toward \\"Drums\\" (\\"Scarlet Begonias\\" > \\"Fire on the Mountain\\"). Dave's Picks Volume 1 is an audacious but appropriate inauguration for this archive series. It sets the bar high, but that should only insure subsequent releases match the standards the Grateful Dead set for itself.\\" In Relix, Jeff Tamarkin said, \\"Most Deadheads, regardless of when they came on board, have a favorite era or specific year, and for many, 1977 is high on the list. Refreshed from a year-plus-long hiatus, and with drummer Mickey Hart now back in the band after his own extended layoff, the Grateful Dead was tight and rejuvenated. This May show from Virginia is a slow-builder, picking up steam midway through the first set with Bob Weir's \\"Cassidy\\" and Jerry Garcia's \\"Loser\\" and never looking back. The band interplay in the \\"Lazy Lightning\\" > \\"Supplication\\" jam that follows is where the album kicks into high gear, but it‚Äôs the second set that's the keeper... As quintessentially delicious as the playing is in Richmond, the true highlights are Garcia and Weir‚Äôs vocal performances; both were singing with a newly discovered care for nuance that served the music supremely well. Judging by this first release in David Lemieux‚Äôs new series, Dave's Picks will be a worthy successor to the vaunted Dick's Picks series.\\" Track listing =Disc 1= :First set: #\\"Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo\\" (Jerry Garcia, Robert Hunter) ‚Äì 10:42 #\\"Jack Straw\\" (Bob Weir, Hunter) ‚Äì 6:17 #\\"They Love Each Other\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 7:21 #\\"Mexicali Blues\\" (Weir, John Perry Barlow) ‚Äì 3:39 #\\"Peggy-O\\" (traditional, arranged by Grateful Dead) ‚Äì 7:44 #\\"Cassidy\\" (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 5:27 #\\"Loser\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 8:32 #\\"Lazy Lightning\\" > (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 3:14 #\\"Supplication\\" (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 5:13 #\\"Brown-Eyed Women\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 6:10 #\\"Promised Land\\" (Chuck Berry) ‚Äì 4:32 =Disc 2= :Second set: #\\"Scarlet Begonias\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 10:31 #\\"Fire on the Mountain\\" (Mickey Hart, Hunter) ‚Äì 11:52 #\\"Estimated Prophet\\" > (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 8:41 #\\"He's Gone\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 13:52 #\\"Drums\\" (Hart, Bill Kreutzmann) ‚Äì 5:25 =Disc 3= #\\"The Other One\\" > (Weir, Kreutzmann) ‚Äì 15:15 #\\"Wharf Rat\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 11:10 #\\"The Other One\\" > (Weir, Kreutzmann) ‚Äì 3:38 #\\"The Wheel\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 5:24 #\\"Around and Around\\" (Berry) ‚Äì 9:10 :Encore: # * \\"Johnny B.

This notion is formalized in the axiomatic definition of a model category. A model category is a category with classes of morphisms called weak equivalences, fibrations, and cofibrations, satisfying several axioms. The associated homotopy category of a model category has the same objects, but the morphisms are changed in order to make the weak equivalences into isomorphisms. It is a useful observation that the associated homotopy category depends only on the weak equivalences, not on the fibrations and cofibrations. Topological spaces Model categories were defined by Quillen as an axiomatization of homotopy theory that applies to topological spaces, but also to many other categories in algebra and geometry. The example that started the subject is the category of topological spaces with Serre fibrations as fibrations and weak homotopy equivalences as weak equivalences (the cofibrations for this model structure can be described as the retracts of relative cell complexes X ‚äÜ YHovey (1999), Definition 2.4.3.). By definition, a continuous mapping f: X ‚Üí Y of spaces is called a weak homotopy equivalence if the induced function on sets of path components :f_*\\\\colon \\\\pi_0(X) \\\\to \\\\pi_0(Y) is bijective, and for every point x in X and every n ‚â• 1, the induced homomorphism :f_*\\\\colon \\\\pi_n(X,x) \\\\to \\\\pi_n(Y,f(x)) on homotopy groups is bijective. (For X and Y path-connected, the first condition is automatic, and it suffices to state the second condition for a single point x in X.) For simply connected topological spaces X and Y, a map f: X ‚Üí Y is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced homomorphism f*: Hn(X,Z) ‚Üí Hn(Y,Z) on singular homology groups is bijective for all n.Hatcher (2002), Theorem 4.32. Likewise, for simply connected spaces X and Y, a map f: X ‚Üí Y is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the pullback homomorphism f*: Hn(Y,Z) ‚Üí Hn(X,Z) on singular cohomology is bijective for all n.Is there the Whitehead theorem for cohomology theory? Example: Let X be the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} and let Y be the set {0} ‚à™ {1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}, both with the subspace topology from the real line. Define f: X ‚Üí Y by mapping 0 to 0 and n to 1/n for positive integers n. Then f is continuous, and in fact a weak homotopy equivalence, but it is not a homotopy equivalence. The homotopy category of topological spaces (obtained by inverting the weak homotopy equivalences) greatly simplifies the category of topological spaces. Indeed, this homotopy category is equivalent to the category of CW complexes with morphisms being homotopy classes of continuous maps. Many other model structures on the category of topological spaces have also been considered. For example, in the Str√∏m model structure on topological spaces, the fibrations are the Hurewicz fibrations and the weak equivalences are the homotopy equivalences.Str√∏m (1972). Chain complexes Some other important model categories involve chain complexes. Let A be a Grothendieck abelian category, for example the category of modules over a ring or the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space. Define a category C(A) with objects the complexes X of objects in A, :\\\\cdots\\\\to X_1\\\\to X_0\\\\to X_{-1}\\\\to\\\\cdots, and morphisms the chain maps. (It is equivalent to consider \\"cochain complexes\\" of objects of A, where the numbering is written as :\\\\cdots\\\\to X^{-1}\\\\to X^0\\\\to X^1\\\\to\\\\cdots, simply by defining Xi = X‚àíi.) The category C(A) has a model structure in which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms and the weak equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms.Beke (2000), Proposition 3.13. By definition, a chain map f: X ‚Üí Y is a quasi- isomorphism if the induced homomorphism :f_*\\\\colon H_n(X) \\\\to H_n(Y) on homology is an isomorphism for all integers n. (Here Hn(X) is the object of A defined as the kernel of Xn ‚Üí Xn‚àí1 modulo the image of Xn+1 ‚Üí Xn.) The resulting homotopy category is called the derived category D(A). Trivial fibrations and trivial cofibrations In any model category, a fibration that is also a weak equivalence is called a trivial (or acyclic) fibration. A cofibration that is also a weak equivalence is called a trivial (or acyclic) cofibration.

Biography Armando Wriedt met Helio Gracie when he was 21 years old; he was in the military service and played Basketball for his regiment. Helio and he had a friend in common and Armando started visiting the Gracie Farm regularly picking up Jiu Jitsu training with the Gracie brotherhood. Finishing his obligatory Military Service time, he turned to the Gracies for shelter and ended up living in the Gracie Academy for 8 years. During this time, Armando fought for the Academy on 3 occasions at Vale-Tudo (no-holds-barred) events in Rio de Janeiro, although fighting was not in his nature. Armando is a true fan of ‚ÄúMahatma‚Äù Gandhi, as he did not believe in violence; to please his teachers, however, he fought and finished all three fights with a quick submission.

Branching off the northern line at Medawachchiya Junction, the line heads north-west through North Central and Northern provinces before terminating at the town of Talaimannar. The line is long and has 11 stations. The line opened in 1914. History =International goal= The Mannar line was built as part of a plan to create a rail link between Sri Lanka and India. A 22-mile bridge to link the two countries had been proposed as early as 1894, by the Consultant Engineer for railways in Madras (Chennai). The proposal was given serious consideration and a technical blueprint and cost analysis was conducted. By 1914, the Mannar line was built to connect Talaimannar on Mannar Island to the Sri Lankan mainland. On the Indian side, the Indian railway network was extended to Dhanushkodi. The international bridge to link the two was not built.http://infolanka.asia/sri-lanka/transport/the-indo-lanka-land-bridge- reviving-the-proposal The Indo-Lanka Land bridge: Reviving the Proposal =Operation= During the Mannar line's operation, trains connected Mannar and Talaimannar with cities along the northern line, such as Anuradhapura and Kurunegala, eventually reaching Colombo. The Boat Mail was a major service on the line, allowing passengers to board a ferry to Rameshwaram in India. Passengers could use the Boat Mail service to travel between Colombo and Chennai. The ferry service to connect the railheads at Talaimannar and Dhanushkodi lasted until the 1960s, when a cyclone destroyed the pier and rail line at Dhanushkodi. The Mannar line was not affected. The ferry service resumed with a new Indian terminus at Rameshwaram. =War and revival= All services on the line were stopped in June 1990 due to the civil war. The tracks, stations and other infrastructure on the line were subsequently destroyed during the war. In the 2000s, the rail bridge to connect the two countries was proposed again, highlighting the benefits of connecting the ports of Colombo and Trincomalee with Chennai. Following the end of the civil war in May 2009, the government initiated various projects to rebuild the entire line. The contract to reconstruct the line between Medawachchiya Junction and Madhu was awarded to IRCON International, the Indian state-owned engineering and construction company. The project will cost US$ 81 million and would be financed by a soft loan from the Indian government. IRCON has also been awarded the contract to reconstruct the line between Madhu and Talaimannar. The project will cost US$ 150 million and would be financed by a soft loan from the Indian government. The section of the line between Medawachchiya and Madhu Road reopened on 14 May 2013, following its reconstruction. The reconstruction of the entire line is completed in 2015. =Completion and reopening= Reopening in Thalaimannar Pier The entire line was completed up to Talaimannar on 2015. The Indian Railway Construction Company Limited (IRCON) carried out the construction work of both stages of the project which was financed under a US$425 million credit facility from India. The reconstructed railway line was commissioned by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 14, 2015. Opening was accompanied by Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and ministers Lakshman Kiriella and Rishard Badurdeen. Services Railbus services operate from Medawachchiya Junction to Madhu Road, while daily trains operate between Madhu Road and Colombo Fort. Four train services are operating between Colombo Fort and the Talaimannr Pier daily. Infrastructure The Mannar line is entirely single track, at 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm) broad gauge, both before the war and after reconstruction.

In compiler theory the notion is distinguished from strong (or structural) equivalence, which additionally means that the two parse trees are reasonably similar in that the same semantic interpretation can be assigned to both. Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994) demonstrates that Linear Indexed Grammars, Combinatory Categorial Grammars, Tree-adjoining Grammars, and Head Grammars are weakly equivalent formalisms, in that they all define the same string languages. On the other hand, if the two grammars generate the same set of derivation trees (or more generally, the same set of abstract syntactic objects), then the two languages are strongly equivalent. Chomsky (1963) introduces the notion of strong equivalence, and argues that only strong equivalence is relevant when comparing grammar formalisms. Kornai and Pullum (1990)Kornai, A. and Pullum, G. K. 1990. The X-bar Theory of Phrase Structure. Language, 66:24-50. and Miller (1994)Miller, Philip H. 1999. Strong Generative Capacity. CSLI publications. offer a refined notion of strong equivalence that allows for isomorphic relationships between the syntactic analyses given by different formalisms. Yoshinaga, Miyao, and Tsujii (2002) offers a proof of the strong equivalency of the LTAG and HPSG formalisms. Context-free grammar example Left: one of the parse trees of the string \\"1+2*3\\" with the first grammar. Right: the only parse tree of that string with the second grammar. As an example, consider the following two context-free grammars,with the start symbol \\"\\" given in Backus-Naur form: ::= \\"+\\"  \\"-\\"  \\"*\\"  \\"/\\"  \\"x\\"  \\"y\\"  \\"z\\"  \\"1\\"  \\"2\\"  \\"3\\"  \\"(\\" \\")\\" ::=  \\"+\\"  \\"-\\" ::=  \\"*\\"  \\"/\\" ::= \\"x\\"  \\"y\\"  \\"z\\"  \\"1\\"  \\"2\\"  \\"3\\"  \\"(\\" \\")\\" Both grammars generate the same set of strings, viz. the set of all arithmetical expressions that can be built from the variables \\"x\\", \\"y\\", \\"z\\", the constants \\"1\\", \\"2\\", \\"3\\", the operators \\"+\\", \\"-\\", \\"*\\", \\"/\\", and parentheses \\"(\\" and \\")\\". However, a concrete syntax tree of the second grammar always reflects the usual order of operations, while a tree from the first grammar need not. For the example string \\"1+2*3\\", the right part of the picture shows its unique parse tree with the second grammar;using the abbreviation \\"E\\", \\"T\\", and \\"F\\" for , , and , respectively evaluating this tree in postfix order will yield the proper value, 7. In contrast, the left picture part shows one of the parse trees for that string with the first grammar; evaluating it in postfix order will yield 9. Since the second grammar cannot generate a tree corresponding to the left picture part, while the first grammar can, both grammars are not strongly equivalent. Generative capacity In linguistics, the weak generative capacity of a grammar is defined as the set of all strings generated by it,for context-free grammars: see Context-free grammar#Context-free language for a formal definition while a grammar's strong generative capacity refers to the set of \\"structural descriptions\\"for context-free grammars: concrete syntax trees generated by it. As a consequence, two grammars are considered weakly equivalent if their weak generative capacities coincide; similar for strong equivalence.

Life  Esther Glen grew up as the third ‚Äì according to other sources, as the second ‚Äì of twelve children of Robert Parker Glen and Alice Helen White in Linwood. At the age of eleven she won a writing competition, sending in a story to the magazine Little Folks. After she had finished school, Esther Glen went to Australia in order to help her sister Helen running a kindergarten. It was there that she first encountered Australian children's books, most of all Seven Little Australians by Ethel Turner which was quite successful at the time and which had been first published in 1894. Up to then, there were no children's books by New Zealand authors. Esther Glen wrote Six little New Zealanders, first published in 1917, creating a story that drew on the experience of children growing up in New Zealand. The story is about three bachelors who are not used to children, running a sheep station in Canterbury. Their six nephews and nieces from Auckland pay them a visit during summer. As they are not used to life in the countryside, this leads to some comical complications. Until 1983 the book has been published in six editions.See Six little New Zealanders in: Glen, Esther.

Esther Glen also was socially committed and a philanthropist. She founded clubs where children could meet and make friends, so as to overcome their isolation in the New Zealand countryside. During the Great Depression children knitted, sewed, and cooked there for the poor. Glen also contributed to the Christchurch Women's Unemployment Committee, speaking out in favour of single women given adequate accommodation. She supported setting up a children's home there.

Myers (April 30, 1864 - November 23, 1931) was an American astronomer, mathematician and progressive educator. Born in Champaign Illinois, he earned his bachelor's degree in 1888 from the University of Illinois and his Ph.D in 1896 from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Germany under the supervision of Hugo von Seeliger. University of Illinois George W. Myers graduated from the local University of Illinois with a degree in mathematics in 1888 and stayed as an instructor teaching both mathematics courses was well as the spring descriptive astronomy class. Myers along with several other mathematics professors wanted to develop an astronomy program that went beyond meeting the needs of civil engineers. To that end he worked to have the university construct a larger teaching observatory. That goal was accomplished in 1896 when the University of Illinois Observatory was complete and Myers was named director as well as Professor of Astronomy and Mathematics. Myers conducted the first theoretical study of the eclipsing binary star Beta Lyrae as part of his dissertation. He used a light curve created by Argelander in 1859 that was based on eye estimated of the brightness of the stars. Using the light curve, he was able to describe the system of two stars almost in contact and elongated. Using A.A. Belopolsky's radial-velocity measurements, he determined the semi-major axis of the orbits and that the two stars were 21 times and 9.5 times the mass of the sun. He went further, noting the strong absorptions lines in the spectrum, to suggest that the two stars orbited within an envelope of gas. Myers first presented the results on October 20, 1897, at the opening conference for Yerkes Observatory, then published the results in the Astrophysical Journal. Mathematics education at the University of Chicago Myers accepted a position as the head of the mathematics department of the Chicago Institute in 1900. Col. Parker was recruiting progressive educators with attractive salaries. The following year he was appointed Professor of Teaching of Mathematics and Astronomy at the University of Chicago where he remained until his retirement in 1929. He appeared as an associate editor of astronomy in the first issue of School Science and Mathematics and continued to serve on the editorial staff and creating more than thirty contributions. Myers was a recognized pioneer in progressive mathematics education as demonstrated by two of his books published in 1910, First Year Mathematics and Second Year Mathematics. Family Born in Champaign to Robert Henry and Mary Helen Shawhan Myers, graduated from Urbana High School then University of Illinois. Myers married Mary Eva Sims of Urbana in 1889. He had three children, Sarah Helen Myers, Joseph Myers, and Mrs. R. E. Lee.

Early life Gillon was born on 21 January 1842 in Douglas, Isle of Man. He arrived in New Zealand with his parents in 1851 aboard the ship Maori and settled in Otago, where for several years he endured the rough experiences of settlement in a new country. Career While quite a youth he became a contributor to the Otago Witness, and was engaged reporting the Otago Provincial Council proceedings for that paper, when, in 1861, the Otago goldfields were discovered. Gillon was at once sent to Gabriel's Gully as special correspondent for the Otago Witness, and was the first press representative on the diggings. He remained there until recalled to Dunedin to again report in the Provincial Council, and he was so engaged when Julius Vogel arrived from Australia and, entering into partnership with William Cutten, the proprietor of the Otago Witness, established the Otago Daily Times, the first daily paper published in New Zealand. Gillon joined the Otago Daily Times staff as chief reporter, and remained on it until early the following year, when severe illness compelled him to relinquish newspaper work for a time. He accepted a Government appointment which, after two or three years, he resigned to resume journalistic work. In 1867 he went to Wellington as a member of the first Hansard staff, and was subsequently appointed Clerk of Private Bills to the New Zealand Parliament. He resigned this office after a brief tenure in order to devote himself exclusively to literary work, and became connected with The Evening Post as well as acting as special correspondent for the Otago Daily Times, Lyttelton Times, and other leading journals. He contested the , standing in the electorate against Alfred Brandon, who had been representing the area since (from 1860 to 1870, the area was covered by the electorate). Whilst there was criticism of Brandon not having had a good connection to his electorate, Brandon won with a solid majority. On 3 June 1875, Gillon was elected to the Wellington Provincial Council in the City of Wellington electorate. He served until provincial government was abolished in October 1876. Gillon stood in the 1875 election in the Wellington Country against the incumbent, Brandon, and J. H. Wallace. Brandon was again successful and received 208 votes versus 141 for Gillon, with Wallace a distant last. In 1872, when cable communication between Europe and Australia was first established, Sir Julius Vogel brought about a combination of New Zealand papers for obtaining supplies of telegraphic news, and Gillon was selected as manager. After a time this association handed its business over to a private firm, and Gillon rejoined The Evening Post as editor. In 1878 another press association was formed, and Gillon was again appointed manager. In less than two years this association absorbed all opposition, and developed into the United Press Association, which Gillon continued to manage with great success until 1884, when he resigned in order to resume his former position of editor of The Evening Post. Gillon was recognised as the doyen of New Zealand journalists, and when the Institute of Journalists was formed he was unanimously chosen as Chairman of the Council. At one time one of the prizes offered by the New Zealand Parliament for the best essays on the settlement of the people on the land was awarded to Gillon. He was a Justice of the Peace, and occupied a prominent position in the Freemasonry. As chairman of the central executive committee, he was the leading spirit in the movement which recently resulted successfully in the establishment of an independent Grand Lodge of New Zealand. As he declined to accept active office, the rank of Past Deputy Grand Master was conferred upon him, in recognition of his services to the craft. Death Gillon died in Wellington on 19 April 1896, and he was buried in the Bolton Street Cemetery.

One of the first to practise hip replacement in New Zealand, he was prominent in the foundation of the New Zealand Orthopaedic Association and became its first president. He was associated with a number of humanitarian causes including the New Zealand Red Cross Society of which he was chairman and latterly president.  Early life  Gillies was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 26 September 1891. His father Gilbert Wilson Gillies and his mother, Agnes Gibson had emigrated to New Zealand from Scotland. He was educated at Otago Boys‚Äô High School from where he went on to the University of Otago, Dunedin, where he studied medicine. As an undergraduate he gained a blue for rugby union. While still a student he was called up for service in the First World War in 1916, serving with the New Zealand expeditionary forces( NCEF) in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. Photographs of his activities during this time are held in the National Library of New Zealand. He was awarded an NCEF scholarship, awarded to demobilised New Zealand soldiers, and this enabled him to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated MB ChB in 1923. Three years later he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd).  Career  Gillies had originally considered specialising in public health but chose instead a career in the developing surgical speciality of orthopaedics. He trained under Sir Robert Jones, one of the leaders in this new speciality. Initially he worked under Jones as assistant orthopaedic surgeon at the Shropshire Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, and at the Royal Southern Hospital, Liverpool. In 1927 he gained further surgical experience at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota with William Mayo and the following year was appointed orthopaedic surgeon at the Lockwood Clinic in Toronto. When he returned to New Zealand in 1929, he was appointed orthopaedic surgeon at Wellington Hospital. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the founding of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1927 and became a fellow of the College in 1932. Gillies returned to Liverpool in 1936 to take the degree of Master of Surgery in orthopaedics (MCh Orth) from the University of Liverpool. He returned again to the UK in 1940, acting as resident commissioner for the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John of Jerusalem. He was a founder member of the New Zealand Orthopaedic Association and served as its first president. Gillies is remembered for his role in establishing orthopaedics as a surgical speciality in New Zealand. He was among the first to perform hip replacement in New Zealand. He was also devoted to several humanitarian causes such as the New Zealand Red Cross Society of which he became chairman then president. He was joint founder of the New Zealand Crippled Children Society and founded the New Zealand Association of Health, Physical Education and Recreation. He became patron of the New Zealand Physical Education Society, which became Physical Education New Zealand (PENZ). Gillies was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to orthopaedic surgery, in the 1959 Queen's Birthday Honours. His name is commemorated in the Sir Alexander Gillies Gold medal which is awarded for distinguished and outstanding service to PENZ.  Family  Gillies married Effie Lovica Wooler (n√©e Shaw) in Glasgow, Scotland, on 21 September 1920; she died in 1972. Two daughters from that marriage predeceased him. He married Joan Mary Kennedy in 1978 and died in Wellington on 19 February 1982.

The airline was established in October 1988 and started operations on December 1, 1990. Thomas L. Cooper, the founder, was a former Boeing 727 captain for Eastern Air Lines during the pilots' strike in 1989. Initially it operated as an on-demand air taxi between Miami, Florida and Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti, but was relocated to the Bahamas when the political climate in Haiti forced the operation to halt. The airline also flew diplomatic mail to the U.S. Interest in Havana, Cuba on a weekly basis. In May 1994, a codeshare agreement was signed with United Airlines. In December 1995, Gulfstream began the transition from a Part 135 carrier to a Part 121 carrier, allowing operation of larger aircraft such as leased Short 360 commuter turboprops. Gulfstream's parent company, G-Air Holdings, acquired Paradise Island Airlines in August 1998 and continued to operate its de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7s. Prior to Trans World Airlines' (TWA) acquisition by American Airlines, Gulfstream operated as a part of the Trans World Connection network as TWConnection. Gulfstream International Airlines had a program in which first officers paid for their training in the Beech 1900 and flew as a line qualified first officer. To gain experience, pilots with low experience paid the airline to ride in the right seat in duty positions normally occupied by a paid professional; albeit one that receives very little pay. This was also the case with captains early on with candidates paying $15,000 up front starting in 1992 with Avtar International doing the recruiting and advertising. However, these pilots received compensation following successful completion of Initial Operating Experience (IOE). So called \\"Pay to work\\" programs started with Avtar International selling multi- engine time in Cessna 402s with the assurance from the Miami Flight Standard District Office that this time was loggable. Avtar International was started by Vic Johnson of New Jersey and Bill Veiga, a former Cessna test pilot. Initially, most intern pilots were sent to Gulfstream's chief competitor, Airways International as Gulfstream possessed only one aircraft, a Cessna 402B. As Gulfstream continued to grow, they took a majority of the Avtar pilots. Soon, a turboprop program was added with the company's acquisition of 15 passenger Beechcraft C99 Airliners. Simultaneously, Avtar offered a heavy turboprop program with Airways International on their SD3-330. This program ended with the demise of Airways International and was only briefly restored with Gulfstream's own SD3-360s. While applicants have paid to be Captains and First Officers on all aircraft types operated by Gulfstream, the vast majority flew the airline's 19 passenger Beechcraft 1900. The programs for the CE-402, BE-C99, and Shorts 360 ended in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Pilots who have interned with Gulfstream have been hired by many other airlines, including major airlines. While most have become successful pilot, some have been among the crews of prominent accidents, such as Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701, Comair Flight 5191 and Colgan Air Flight 3407. Gulfstream itself has never had a fatal accident. In July 1997, the airline's entire fleet of Shorts 360-300s were repossessed by the leasing company due, in part, to maintenance irregularities that included the welding of hydraulic lines. Gulfstream faced a civil penalty of US$1.3 million. Gulfstream's affiliate, Gulfstream Flight Academy, the successor to Avtar, came under scrutiny because Marvin Renslow, the pilot of Colgan Air Flight 3407, trained there. =2000s= In August 2003, Paradise Island Airlines' operating certificate was sold to US Airways Group. In 2004, a long-term codeshare agreement with Continental Airlines was signed. In March 2006, Thomas L. Cooper sold his stake in the company to Gulfstream International Group, Inc., a newly formed corporation. In 2009, U.S. Congress investigators and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) accused Gulfstream of falsifying flight time records, making crews fly longer hours than allowed by law, and providing below standard aircraft maintenance. The company's owner and chief pilot, Thomas L. Cooper, forbade the photocopying of aircraft logbooks done by some pilots to corroborate the times they logged in their personal logbooks. Historically, pilots were paid \\"segment hours\\" which were based on en route (or takeoff-to-landing) times as opposed to block (or gate-to-gate) times and have been suspected of being part of an inducement for under reporting. Logging of true block hours could be detrimental to a pilot's pay. Whereas, most carriers pay pilots based on block time, since it is what FAA flight time limits are based on, Gulfstream did not. An incentive existed to under report block time by keeping it as close to en route time as possible thereby permitting pilots to get paid for the most en route hours in a given period. Delays that increased block times not only reduced the crewmember's utility to Gulfstream but also limited his pay. In 2009, Gulfstream International Airlines came under additional scrutiny due to three fatal crashes that all involved pilotsCorrigan: Airline That Trained Pilots in 3 Most Recent Regional Crashes Culture Wars Online Magazine, 2011 that were trained at the Gulfstream Training Academy (its sister companyAlan Levin: Airline That Trained Buffalo Crash Pilot Fined $1.3M USA Today, May 21, 2009), the last one in February 2009, where 50 died on Colgan Air Flight 3407 near Buffalo, NY.Allan Chernoff and Laura Dolan: Florida's 'pilot factory' CNN.com, May 28, 2009 In May 2009, the federal government issued a fine of $1.3 million against Gulfstream International Airlines after the Federal Aviation Administration found that it had falsified flight time records, allowing crews to fly longer hours than allowed by law, and providing below standard aircraft maintenance. In response, CEO Dave Hackett stated that \\"the airline does not have safety violations\\"Scrutiny of Gulfstream Intensifies Wall Street Journal online, May 27, 2009\\"Gulfstream International denies allegations of safety violations.\\" and \\"the vast majority of findings were not violations at all\\".David Hackett (Continental Connection): RE: Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc Letter to the FAA, June 11, 2009 =2010s= On November 4, 2010, Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Yu, Roger. \\"Gulfstream International files for bankruptcy protection.\\" USA Today.
