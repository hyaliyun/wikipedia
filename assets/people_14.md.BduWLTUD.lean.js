History The interior of the Sydney Glaciarium, May 1940. State Library of New South Wales A proposal for the construction of an ice skating rink, on the site of a former Cyclorama located on George Street, Sydney near the railway, was published 20 November 1906. The rink would feature large refrigeration works and cooling chambers for commercial use in the basement of the building. The architects appointed for the construction were Coxon and Cuthbert. The main entrance to George Street was widened to with a wide corridor with attached office suites and cloakrooms. The corridor would lead to the rink area on an incline with Ladies' and Gentleman's retiring rooms at the entry to the main area which was a by space. The ice skating surface was by with coiled pipes containing brine covered in of water ice. The Sydney Glaciarium was opened to the public on the afternoon of 25 July 1907 in front of an estimated 2000 spectators. The opening ceremony was performed by New South Wales Premier Mr. J. H. Carruthers. The first season of ice skating and ice activities at the Sydney Glaciarium concluded at 11:00pm on 2 November 1907 with 800 skaters taking to the ice for the last time in the season. There was a signal given to cease skating and the skaters joined hands and sang Auld Lang Syne as well as the Australian National Anthem. Cheers were given to the rink manager, Dunbar Poole. The building would still be used until the next ice skating season began, as a wooden floor could be put down and the hall used for another purpose during the warm months of the year. use of the Glaciarium during the warmer season was secured by Mr. Thomas James West for the showing of films. = Pricing and session times = When the Sydney Glaciarium opened there were 3 sessions available during the day: * Morning Session 10:00am to 12:00noon * Afternoon Session 2:00pm to 5:00pm * Evening Session 8:00pm to 10:30pm Pricing for admission was 2 shillings. Pricing for ice skate hire was 6 pence = Architecture and specifications = The Sydney Glaciarium was built on the site of the old Cyclorama, which was demolished. The ice floor was 51.82 meters (170 feet) long and 23.16 meters (76 feet) wide and the apex of the steel roof was 18.59 meters (61 feet) high when measured from the floor. The ice floor itself had a sheet of ice that was approximately 10.16 cm (4 inches) thick and was transparent so that the estimated 11-13Km (7-8 miles) of piping was visible. The building was illuminated with electric lighting.  Ice hockey  With the opening of the Sydney Glaciarium, ice hockey matches between Victoria and New South Wales representative teams began almost immediately. Teams from both states met up in the Sydney Glaciarium to play on 5 August 1907 at 10:15pm. The New South Wales team won the game 3 - 0. A 1908 postcard welcoming the fleet to Australia In its second ice skating season, the Sydney Glaciarium management drew plans to facilitate ice hockey matches between an Australian team selected from ice skating patrons and teams drawn from the crew of various visiting fleet of American warships, known by the name Great White Fleet. Sydney was the first stop made by the fleet to Australia and invitations to the proposed hockey match were sent to the officers and petty officers of each warship, planning to host the match on the evening of their arrival on 20 August 1908. The first match that was arranged ended up being scheduled for the evening of 26 August 1907 at the Sydney Glaciarium. Though the American team had not been on skates for 3 years, they still managed to win the game 5 - 1 against the Australian team formed from Sydney Glaciarium patrons. The Australian team was first to score but the Americans would tie up the game in the first half. In the second half, the Americans would go on to score 4 more goals. An important aspect to this game was that the American players were using much larger hockey sticks than the local Australian team. The fleet would visit Melbourne afterwards where they would play ice hockey against a local team, presumably again, using the larger ice hockey sticks and a puck made from a disc of wood. Due to the Americans being short of 2 players, each team played with only 5 men per side but this would play an important part to establishing the codified version of ice hockey in Australia rather than the Australian variant played before.

Digital Novel Markup Language Digital Novel Markup Language (DNML) is one of the first scripting language game engines for creating visual novels, also known as interactive fiction games. DNML was developed using C++ by a Japanese programmer known by his or her Internet name, Karin. The initial release was in 1998. The programming structure is similar to HTML, which made it easy to produce dōjin games. DNML was succeeded by software like NScripter, KiriKiri and Ren'Py.DNML website KiriKiri is a scripting engine by Japanese developer \\"w.dee\\", initially released in 1998. It is almost exclusively used with the KAG (KiriKiri Adventure Game System) framework as a visual novel engine. Usually, the package of the two components is regarded as the whole engine, and referenced with major version numbers. Thus, the current version is called KiriKiri2/KAG3. It is available under the GNU General Public License, though commercial licenses can be acquired if somebody wishes to expand the software without disclosing the changes. KiriKiri has been used in both dōjin and commercial visual novels, the most well known of which are TYPE-MOON's Fate/stay night and Fate/hollow ataraxia. It is often used as a more modern and expandable replacement of the older NScripter engine. Another game notable visual novel that is known to be implemented using this engine is . The Nekopara game series, available on Steam, also uses a modified version of Kirikiri. For KiriKiri2 and KirikiriZ's implementation of KAG there is a module called 鱧天 (Hamotem).http://hamotem.f-sp.net/ which provides a myriad of plugins and a ready made template to build games on. As TyranoBuilder is to TyranoScript, there are several programs which create a graphical editor on top of the KAG script. The most well known of these is NVLMaker,http://www.nvlmaker.net/ which also has a cloud platform.https://cn.nvl.cloud Due to a lack of updates since October 2010, from 2013 onward the code has been forked and continued as .Kirikiri Z GitHub NScripter NScripter is a visual novel engine written by Naoki Takahashi. Due to its simplicity and its liberal license (while it is not open-source software, royalty-free commercial use is permitted), it quickly became popular in Japan, and was used for a number of high-profile commercial and dōjin titles, such as HaniHani and Tsukihime. The original NScripter is closed- source and only available for Windows. A number of cross-platform clones have been written. The best-knownREADME, ONScripter-EN source code, 20101010 release NScripter clone is the free and open-source software implementation, ONScripter. Its popularity among the visual novel localisation community is attributed to the ease of modifying the engine to support languages other than Japanese. It strives to maintain compatibility with visual novels designed for NScripter.README, PONScripter source code, 20100502 release ONScripter is based on the Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library, and can thus be used to run NScripter games on platforms supported by SDL, such as OS X, Linux, PSP and the iPod. ONScripter-EN is a branch of ONScripter that is maintained separately by the English-language community, for convenience and for ease of introducing enhancements that are suited to the community. PONScripter (abbreviation for \\"Proportional-OnScripter\\") is a fork of ONScripter-EN. Its stated goal is to provide an easy porting target for translation projects, with emphasis on Western languages. PONScripter has made heavy modifications to the ONScripter-EN base code, and is deliberately backwards-incompatible. PONScripter was originally maintained by Peter \\"Haeleth\\" Jolly. Since September 2009, it is maintained by Mion of Sonozaki Futago-tachi, the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni translation group. KScripter is a Flash-based scripting engine that was inspired by NScripter but uses ActionScript and SWF. Ren'Py The Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine is a free software engine. Ren'Py is a portmanteau of , the Japanese word for 'love', a common element of games made using Ren'Py; and Python, the programming language that Ren'Py runs on. The easy to learn script language allows anyone to efficiently write large visual novels, while its Python scripting is enough for complex simulation games. Ren'Py has proved attractive to western hobbyists; over 1000 games use the Ren'Py engine, nearly all in English. Visual novels, kinetic novels, role- playing games, simulation games, and many other games can be made with Ren'py.  TyranoBuilder  TyranoBuilder is a commercial visual novel engine that supports creating projects as web apps, as well as native app for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. Most of its functionality are available via its GUI, without resorting to scripting. It is based on TyranoScript, which is a free web focused engine that is in Japanese, although a partial English version exists. The syntax which both TyranoBuilder and TyranoScript use is very similar to the scripting language of KirKirki, although not as flexible. A unique feature of TyranoBuilder is its support for Live 2D, which most other engines lack. http://tyranobuilder.com/faq/ https://evanburchard.github.io/tyranoscript/  Suika 2  Suika 2 is a free and open source visual novel engine. It supports Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Android. Owing to the way it is written it is very easy to port off other platforms. In terms of syntax it is a mix of Kirikiri and Nscripter, utilising a more traditional syntax. It is one of the few Japanese visual novel engines that natively support English text. When compared to other engines it is very simple, however a user can customize it with relatively little effort. It is notable for its extremely low hardware requirements, being capable of running smoothly in a system with no proper graphical acceleration. The engine was first released in 2001, being bundled with a visual editor similar in function to Tyranobuilder's GUI. Suika 2 was released in 2016, with all of its components being rewritten except for its image processing components. The engine can be downloaded from either its website or Github page.https://github.com/ktabata/suika2https://luxion.jp/s2/en/index.html  NVList  NVList is an open source visual novel engine that runs on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, and even online (through an applet).

Deforestation and exploitation of natural landscapes play a significant role. Some of these environmental changes are similar to those caused by the effects of global warming. Deforestation effects Major land surface changes affecting climate include deforestation (especially in tropical areas), and destruction of grasslands and xeric woodlands by overgrazing, or lack of grazing. These changes in the natural landscape reduce evapotranspiration, and thus water vapor, in the atmosphere, limiting clouds and precipitation. It has been proposed, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, that evaporation rates from forested areas may exceed that of the oceans, creating zones of low pressure, which enhance the development of storms and rainfall through atmospheric moisture recycling. The American Institute of Biological Sciences published a similar paper in support of this concept in 2009. In addition, with deforestation and/or destruction of grasslands, the amount of dew harvested (or condensed) by plants is greatly diminished. All of this contributes to desertification in these regions. This concept of land- atmosphere feedback is common among permaculturists, such as Masanobu Fukuoka, who, in his book, The One Straw Revolution, said \\"rain comes from the ground, not the sky.\\"1978 1975 Sep. – The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming, translators Chris Pearce, Tsune Kurosawa and Larry Korn, Rodale Press. Deforestation, and conversion of grasslands to desert, may also lead to cooling of the regional climate. This is because of the albedo effect (sunlight reflected by bare ground) during the day, and rapid radiation of heat into space at night, due to the lack of vegetation and atmospheric moisture. Reforestation, conservation grazing, holistic land management, and, in drylands, water harvesting and keyline design, are examples of methods that might help prevent or lessen these drying effects. Mountain meteorological effects =Orographic lift= Orographic lift occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain. As the air mass gains altitude it quickly cools down adiabatically, which can raise the relative humidity to 100% and create clouds and, under the right conditions, precipitation. =Rain shadow= A rain shadow is a dry area on the leeward side of a mountainous area (away from the wind). The mountains block the passage of rain-producing weather systems and cast a \\"shadow\\" of dryness behind them. Wind and moist air is drawn by the prevailing winds towards the top of the mountains, where it condenses and precipitates before it crosses the top. In an effect opposite that of orographic lift, the air, without much moisture left, advances behind the mountains creating a drier side called the \\"rain shadow\\". =Foehn wind= A föhn or foehn is a type of dry, warm, down-slope wind that occurs in the lee (downwind side) of a mountain range. Föhn can be initiated when deep low pressures move into Europe drawing moist Mediterranean air over the Alps. It is a rain shadow wind that results from the subsequent adiabatic warming of air that has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes (see orographic lift). As a consequence of the different adiabatic lapse rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the windward slopes. Föhn winds can raise temperatures by as much as 14 °C (25 °F) in just a matter of minutes. Central Europe enjoys a warmer climate due to the Föhn, as moist winds off the Mediterranean Sea blow over the Alps.

Setting  The play alternates between two settings. Scenes take place either in a hotel or in Morgan's basement.  Plot  = Scene One = The play opens with Constantine alone on stage. He speaks to the audience and admits to being two days old as well as being dead. He quickly leaves the stage when he hears his mother's cries. He leaves saying that he doesn't have much time, as his body continues to grow stiff. = Scene Two = Taking place in a hotel, Dolores is shooting pool. She is dressed in dominatrix gear. As she plays, a woman enters with a carnival mask on, hiding her face. She apologizes for being late, and Dolores is quick to establish the rules of how their exchange will go. After demanding payment first, money is exchanged and the woman begins to lament on how she feels she is a failure and sought out Dolores business in hopes for redemption of some sort. It is at this point that Dolores vomits. Despite the woman's concern, Dolores claims it is food poisoning and demands the woman to take off the mask. It is revealed to be Elena. Kicking her out, Dolores suggests they reschedule. Elena exits and Dolores is left alone on stage. = Scene Three = Constantine enters the stage and remarks of the new things he has been learning. He speaks of experiencing rain for the first time and how he has learned new words such as \\"hardcore\\". He mentions his mother hasn't cried that day, but when she does, he tries to find her despite his bones getting stiffer. He leaves once he hears her cries. = Scene Four = Taking place in Morgan's basement, Morgan speaks with Elena. Morgan describes the pain she is feeling since her still birth. Elena listens and comments on the casseroles people have brought over to her. They discuss if there is fault to be found in his death, and Morgan decides she wants to see Constantine, as she regrets her choice to not hold his body in the hospital. = Scene Five = The scene opens with Dolores laying on the pool table in the hotel, telling dead baby jokes to her stomach. She speaks to her body, saying she is not \\"going to keep you\\". Constantine enters. He explains to Dolores how he is both two days old and dead. The two converse and Dolores asks what it's like to be dead. Constantine talks about wanting to see his mother and learns a new curse word. Dolores allows him to go up to her room with her. = Scene Six = Elena is on the phone with the hospital where Constantine's body was taken. There is an issue with locating him, and Morgan demands they find her son. When they hang up the phone, Elena admits that Morgan will soon be hearing from The Board of Nursing. Aiming to prove that children must be delivered in a hospital to avoid any situations like that of Morgan and Constantine's, Elena remarks that they will likely try to take her medical license away. She continues to say how Constantine's death affects her every day. Elena leaves at Morgan's request, but not before she gives Morgan a pumpkin. Morgan remarks how it is dead, but she will love it anyway. = Scene Seven = Dolores and Constantine are in her hotel room. She paints his nails and they discuss how Dolores got pregnant. Dolores notices the hospital bracelet on Constantine's foot and remarks how it says his mother's name is Morgan. Constantine mentions he never knew her name, as he cannot read. He tells Dolores he wants to see her, but she responds that it might be too much of a shot to see him so suddenly. They decide on writing a letter instead, and Morgan writes down a simple message saying that Constantinople would like to see Morgan. Constantinople signs it to the best of his ability and wishes for Dolores to no longer be sad. She admits that with him around, she feels less lonely. She leaves to deliver the letter, and as he is alone on stage, Constantinople recognizes that he is angry for the first time. = Scene Eight = Morgan and Dolores are sitting in Morgan's basement. Morgan inquires if Dolores is truly there under the pretenses she claims (being a part of a church group). Eventually, Dolores admits that she knows about Morgan's situation and gives her condolences as well as hints at knowing Constantinople without giving too much away. Morgan responds that Dolores looks pregnant, remarking how she can sense it. Dolores tells her of her intentions to not keep the child and the two discuss abortion and life in general. Dolores admits she tried to kill herself in the past and Morgan states if she was Dolores' mother, she would feel terrible for not giving her the life she deserved. Dolores leaves via window without giving Morgan the letter from Constantinople. = Scene Nine = Elena returns to the hotel to find Constantinople. The two interact with one another without knowing how they're connected. Elena, believing Constantinople works with Dolores, has him read off insults to her. As he does, she breaks down and he tries to comfort her. Elena mentions he seems familiar and before she can find out his identity, Dolores comes back and promptly kicks her out again. Elena leaves and Constantinople inquires about the letter. Dolores claims she couldn't find Morgan because she had left town. At this, Constantinople begins to cry out of fear of becoming too stiff and decomposed by the time Morgan returns. In response, Dolores tells him to write another letter and she will make sure it gets to Morgan this time. = Scene Ten = Dolores returns to Morgans house and the two sit down and talk again. The conversation turns to the topic of Dolores getting an abortion and while initially defensive against Morgan, Dolores becomes touched by her advice and opinions. Stating that she does not have the right to govern Dolores' actions, Morgan also notes that she believes Dolores doesn't truly want to get rid of her baby. In return, Dolores asks about Constantinople and what Morgan was feeling. Morgan admits it is nice to talk about him and the two share an intimate embrace. = Scene Eleven = Elena is in the hotel once again and Constantinople (in dominatrix clothing) finds her. She is cradling another pumpkin underneath the pool table. Joining her, Constantinople learns she has lost her nursing license. The two share their fears and Elena admits Constantinople may be right when he said she might need to find a new purpose in life. As he recounts that he is getting more and more stiff, he hears Morgan's heartbeat and runs off stage to find her. Elena calls after him, but seeing the dominatrix gear he has left behind, thanks him, instead. = Scene Twelve = Dolores and Morgan are still in the basement, and Constantinople appears at the window. As he is let in, it becomes apparent that neither Morgan or Constantinople can hear the other. Dolores explains that he is her son and that he wishes to see her. She apologizes for not telling her about him sooner, and leaves. Both Constantinople and Morgan speak to the other even though it is not being heard. Constantinople admits he wish he could stay and how he is confused, but he admits he knows Morgan loves him. Morgan recounts what it was like being pregnant with him and what her life will be like without him. = Scene Thirteen = Elena is in dominatrix gear and speaking to various pumpkins set on top of the pool table in the hotel. As Dolores comes back in, Elena allows her counsel as Dolores seems upset. As they speak, Dolores admits she has messed up in the past, but that those things shape who she is today. As Dolores leaves to write another letter, Elena muses how her new shape isn't that of a dominatrix, and leaves the hotel. = Scene Fourteen = Constantinople, Morgan, and Dolores are all on stage, facing the audience. They each speak as though writing a letter and at times, speak at the same time. Constantinople speaks to his mother, Morgan to Constantinople, and Dolores to the child inside her. Dolores speaks of how she will be waiting and ready for when the child arrives. Constantinople admits he will miss Morgan, and he thanks her before fading off stage. Morgan is left alone on stage. She speaks of what her loss feels like and what she will deal with in the rest of her life. She speaks of her hopes of sharing Constantinople with more children and how she will never stop missing and loving him. Lights fade on Morgan and the play ends.  Playwright notes  Silverman notes that the play should not contain an intermission. She also explicitly notes that actors should refrain from crying unless specifically stated, and that all crying must be understated and subtle. Silverman remarks that actors should find humor in the dark moments of the play as well as the moments of joy.  References  Bibliography *Silverman, Jen. Yale Drama Series : Still.

They prefer to feed on very low mown grass, and are thus found mostly on golf courses or grass tennis courts. ABWs, as they are often referred to, were only found in the Northeastern United States until the 2000s when sightings began to expand. In recent years they have been found as far north as Ontario and Quebec, as far west as Ohio, and as far south as North Carolina. Their choice of hosts has also expanded, and they have been reported feeding on perennial ryegrass (lolium perenne) and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera). The spread of the ABW Annual bluegrass weevils were first discovered in Connecticut in 1931. They spread slowly at first, contained mostly to New York, New Jersey, and much of New England until after the 1970s, when they were seen in Pennsylvania. It was not until the 2000s, however, that they began to rapidly spread throughout the Mid-Atlantic and into the Midwest. Life cycle * Egg ** Laid by adult females in the leaf sheath * Larvae ** Five instar stages ** Feed on inside of stem in early stage ** When too large for stem, larvae leave into the soil and begin to feed on crown of turf ** Fifth instar larvae are believed to be the most damaging stage * Pupae * Adult ** Feed on blades of turf but damage is negligible Damage and diagnostic features Damage to turfgrass appears as yellowing or browning of patches of turf that will grow larger if untreated. As this symptom can be indicative of a number of issues, there are a few diagnostic features commonly used to identify ABWs as the problem. Stems of the plants will be hollowed out and have a sawdust-like frass left in them, which is a result of the younger larvae feeding on them. Additionally, notches on blades of the turf observed are a sign of adult ABWs feeding. Management Biological management of annual bluegrass weevils has only been proven moderately effective in the lab environment. Research of parasitic nematodes has shown to be promising, while parasitic wasp research has been unsuccessful. Cultural management of annual bluegrass weevil can be achieved by limiting the populations of susceptible hosts, providing adequate moisture and fertility, and removing leaf litter from turf areas in the fall as this is where the adult ABWs overwinter. Chemical management of annual bluegrass weevil is the most effective way to reduce the pest population. Preventive applications of insecticides, especially pyrethroids, should be timed with the local Forsythia bloom (half green/half gold)in order to cut the population before the first generation of eggs are laid for the year.

She supplemented her research with thousands of ethnological photographs of the individuals and groups studied, the quality of which was recognised by Edward Steichen. She experienced chronic illnesses after her return from the field, but nevertheless completed publications and many lectures but did not survive to finish a book The Human Career in Village India which was to integrate and unify her many-sided studies of human character formation in the cultural/historical context of India.Lesser, Alexander 1979 Obituary of Gitel Steed. American Anthropologist 81:88‐91Berleant-Schiller, Riva 1988 Gitel (Gertrude) Poznanski Steed. IN Women Anthropologists: A Biographical Dictionary. Edited by Ute Gacs, Aisha Khan, Jerrie McIntyre, Ruth Weinberg. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. Pp. 331–336. Gitel (Gertrude) Poznanski Steed  Early life  Gertrude Poznanski was born on May 3, 1914, in Cleveland, Ohio, the home of her mother, Sarah Auerbach. She was the youngest of sisters Mary and Helen, who both later emigrated to Israel. Her father was Jakob Poznanski, a businessman and Polish native who had come to the United States from Belgium. When Poznanski was still a baby, the family moved to The Bronx, New York, where she was schooled at Wadleigh High. Though not religious, she adopted the Yiddish name of Gitel. Her mother was active in the women's suffrage movement and in leftist politics. Dr. Steed began a BA in banking and finance at New York University, but embraced the Greenwich Village artistic and political life, often singing blues in nightclubs, and dropped out to take a job as a writer with the Works Progress Administration. Rafael Soyer painted portrait of her at eighteen, Girl in a White Blouse, (1932) which is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and she is the medusa-haired subject in Soyer's Two Girls 1933 (oil on canvas) at the Smart Museum. In 1933 she met the painter Robert Steed (b.1903), whom she married in 1947.  Introduction to anthropology  Philosopher Sidney Hook persuaded Steed to return to NYU and in 1938 she completed her B.A. with honors in sociology and anthropology, then studied as a graduate at Columbia University until 1940 as a Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology under Professor Ruth Benedict whom she had met in 1937 and who in 1939 led Gitel Steed's first field experience among the Blackfoot Indians of Montana.Kehoe, A. B. (1996). Transcribing Insima, a Blackfoot \\"Old Lady\\". Reading beyond words: Native history in context, 381–402. Benedict's Patterns of Culture was published in 1934 and had become standard reading for anthropology courses in American universities for years, and Steed was influenced by Benedict's position in that book that, \\"A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action\\", and that each culture chooses from \\"the great arc of human potentialities\\" only a few characteristics which become the leading personality traits of the persons living in that culture. From 1939 to 1941, Steed undertook research for Vilhjalmur Stefansson, the explorer and writer on Inuit life then planning a two-volume Lives of the Hunters, on diet and subsistence; Steed worked on the South American Ona, Yahgan, and the Antillean Arawak and Carib, and from this formative experience began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer subsistence (not finished until 1969, well after she had established her career).Price, D. H. (2008). Anthropological intelligence: the deployment and neglect of American anthropology in the Second World War. Duke University Press. In 1944, after the Nazi holocaust against the Jews was exposed, Gitel Steed set aside her anthropology and joined the Jewish Black Book Committee, an organization of the World Jewish Congress and other Jewish anti-Fascist groups. With a few peers, she participated during 1944 and 1945 in writing The Black Book: The Nazi Crime Against the Jewish People, an exhaustive indictment of calculated Nazi anti-Jewish war crimes intended for submission to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. Steed wrote \\"The Strategy of Decimation\\" published in 1946 for the Jewish Black Book Committee. Steed taught at Hunter College in New York 1945 and 1947. While teaching at Fisk University in 1946/1947 she researched the Negro in the United States and in Africa and was managing editor of the University's and the American Council on Race Relations' monthly summary of \\"Race Relations\\" in America.Raphael, D. (1978). More on the Nonacademic Scene. Anthropology News, 19(3), 22–22.Lieberman, L. (1997). Gender and the Deconstruction nf the Race Concept. American Anthropologist, 99(3), 545–588. In 1947–1949 she joined Dr. Ruth Bunzel in establishing the China group of Columbia's Research in Contemporary Cultures to study immigrant Chinese culture, primarily in New York City, from 1947 into 1949, working with migrants from the same community from China's Kwantung Provincial village, Toi Shan. She undertook life histories, community self-analysis, and projective tests, then proposed an extended field project in the Toi Shan community to understand the interdependency in social and economic relations between migrants and their kinsmen at home. Margaret Mead and others joined these Columbia comparative studies of contemporary cultures and they were incorporated into Mead's \\"The Study of Cultures at a Distance,\\"Margaret Mead and Rhoda Metraux, and published in 1953 by the University of Chicago Press Steed planned \\"The Effects of Village Institutions on Personality in South China\\" and had funds granted for its continuation of her Chinese research in China. However the occurrence of the Chinese Revolution of 1948 scuttled the project.  India  Steadfastly committed to field study of institutional determinants of individual and social character, she took up the suggestion of psychiatrist, Abram Kardiner, then associated with Columbia University's Department of Sociology, to pursue a similar study in India. Shortly thereafter, Professor Theodore Abel, Department chairman, appointed Steed Director of a two-year field project of research in contemporary India.When Theodore Abel approved the project, his confidence was supported by commonalities with Steed in relation to Nazism, as in 1934 Abel had traveled to Germany to gather autobiographies of members of the National Socialist movement. The hundreds of essays he received enabled him to theorise about how the Nazis managed to gain and retain power. See his \\"Why Hitler Came Power\\", Prentice-Hall, 1938; \\"Systematic Sociology in Germany\\", Octagon, 1966; \\"The Nazi Movement, Atherton\\", 1967 Funding was received through a grant from the Department of the Navy.University of Chicago Library (2009) Guide to the Gitel P. Steed Papers 1907–1980 She assembled a research team of Dr. James Silverberg, Dr. Morris Carstairs of Edinburgh University, and her husband Robert Steed, leaving for Indian in 1949, where there was added a small staff of Indian workers. They included Bhagvati Masher and Kantilal Mehta, who worked as interpreters; Nandlal Dosajh, a psychologist;\\"The real beginning of Projective Psychology in india may be credited to the author with his first exposure with Rorschach test under the guidance of Dr. James Silverberg (1955) who had administered Rorschach Test to the author [Nandlal Dosajh] in 1949 and on the basis of author's performance on this test, he was selected to work with the Columbia University Team under Dr. Gitel P.

In the second year of research, the team also included an Indian assistant, Tahera, as well as Americans Grace Langley and John Koos. Her preparations were aided by her friendship with Gautam Sarabhai, a Gujarati Indian she had met in New York who assisted her in learning Hindustani. She also trained in the use of a professional camera. The research goals and procedures were ambitious; to empirically bring together interactions of individual, culture, community and institutions, relating real individuals, not merely statistical patterns, for functional-historical analysis of character formation at the village levelDonham, B., & Roethlisberger, J.

American Anthropologist, 68(3), 757–758. in the three settlements chosen: Bakrana, a Hindu village in Gujarat; Sujarupa, a Hindu hamlet in Rajputana; and Adhon, a predominantly Muslim village in the United Provinces. Bakrana was a farming economy in fertile flatlands, exclusively Hindu and with an active caste system, largely untouched by the former British rule or by land reform changes current then in India. Sujarupa hamlet was a single-caste community in the upland valleys. Adhon was controlled by pro-independence Muslims, with more occupational castes and subgroups than Bakrana, with religious minorities.  Consolidation of ethnographic research in India  Steed returned to the United States in December 1951 with more than 30,000 pages of handwritten notes and some thousands of ethnological photographs, but infected with malaria, and shortly after her return she also developed diabetes which was particularly difficult to control and frequently put her in hospital. In addition, she suffered for over thirty years from pituitary cancer. Illness impaired her later career so that she was unable to receive her doctorate until 1969, 8 years before her death. In 1963, however, Conrad Arensberg wrote \\"her reputation and accomplishments are such as to make her lack of a PhD of little moment for her standing in the profession\\".Arensberg, Conrad 1963 Unpublished letter on file in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology, Hofstra University, Hempstead, N.Y. Her reputation also rests on her unpublished notes; the thousands of pages of interviews, observations, projective test results, life histories, and villagers' paintings, most of which are now in the special collections of the University of Chicago Libraries. During the eleven years after returning from India and taking up a position at Hofstra College (now Hofstra University) in 1962 where she continued to her death in 1977, Steed had no university affiliation and promoted her work through seminars and lectures at Columbia University, University of Chicago, and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1953, Steed participated in a Social Science Research Council Conference on Economic Development in Brazil, India, and Japan, analyzing Dr. Morris Opler's \\"Cultural Aspects of Economic Development in Rural India\\", then later that year, 1953/4, she analyzed \\"The Individual, Family, and Community in Village India\\" in Columbia University's Department of Sociology graduate seminar on the psychodynamics of culture, chaired by Abram Kardiner. In 1954 Steed lectured on \\"The Child, Family and Community in Rural Gujarat\\" for the University of Chicago Seminar on Village India. The lectures and discussions are recorded in the archive. She presented in India symposia at meetings of the American Anthropological Association, and the Social Science Research Council. Her one publication of note during this period was a chapter \\"Notes on an Approach to a Study of Personality Formation in a Hindu Village in Gujarat\\",Von Fürer-Haimendorf, C.. (1957).

This, and the presentations she made at conferences assisted her in delimiting her doctoral thesis Caste and Kinship in Rural Gujarat: The Social Use of Space. During these eleven years she gave birth to her son, Andrew Hart (b. 1953), and taught English at the Jefferson School, a Manhattan private school favored by the political left. Gitel and husband Robert Steed opened the doors of their house on West 23rd Street to visitors who included Ruth Bunzel, Sula Benet, Vera Rubin, Stanley Diamond, Alexander Lesser, Margaret Mead, and Conrad Arensberg. In 1970 Steed revisited Bakrana, its population then doubled since her last visit, to observe the impact of the transforming politics in India.  Photographer  Edward Steichen, Director of the Department of Photography of the Museum of Modern Art, said Steed's photographs of Indian villagers, which though taken for the anthropological record and used as illustrations in varied lectures and presentations, ranked \\"with first-rate human interpretations by professional photographers.\\"Museum of Modern Art press release of February 19, 1953, for Always the Young Strangers. In 1953, Steichen mounted Always the Young Strangers exhibition at MoMA in honour of Carl Sandberg's 75th birthday and included Gitel Steed's photos, six of which are in the Museum's permanent photographic collection. Steichen again used her pictures in the Museum's world-touring blockbuster, The Family of Man exhibition and book. Her photographs were republished in the New York Times, and featured in the St. Louis Post Despatch. While at Hofstra University, her photographic work was exhibited as part of the University's \\"Focus on India\\" presentation in 1962, and in 1963 Hofstra showed Steed photographs of Hindu and Muslim villagers. That same year Steed held the exhibition Child Life in Village India at the New Canaan Art Association Gallery in Connecticut and another, Cradle to Grave in Village India at the Hudson Guild Gallery in New York. In 1967 Vincent Fresno's Human Actions in Four Societies used a selection as illustrations.  Death and legacy  Dr. Gitel Steed died in the night of September 6, 1977, evidently from a heart attack, at the age of sixty-three. She was survived by her husband and supporter for thirty years, artist Robert Steed, and by her son, Andrew. The Gitel P. Steed papers 1907–1980 are archived in the University of Chicago Library and extend to approximately 13 linear metres (43 feet) of material. Most is data from her Columbia University Research in Contemporary India Field Project of 1949–1951 collected from three villages in western and northern India; extensive life histories of informants, psychological tests, typed notes, field notebooks, photographs, genealogies, histories, transcripts of interviews, and art work, mostly watercolours, by both researchers and child and adult villagers. These are joined by records of lectures and other publications relating to the India Project by Steed and by other scholars. Also held is data from Steed's previous fieldwork project among Chinese immigrants in New York City. The collection was given to the University of Chicago Committee on Southern Asian Studies by Robert Steed in 1978 and conveyed to the University of Chicago Library in 1984. Prior to their arrival, James Silverberg and McKim Marriott put the papers a preliminary order reflected in the collection's current organization. The collection was augmented by Robert Steed in 1985 and 1989, and by McKim Marriott and James Silverberg in 1994.  Publications  * 1946 The Strategy of Decimation.

The process uses high temperature and pressure, which results in the extraction taking less time and requiring less solvent, and possibly also giving better analyte recovery, than traditional methods that use less extreme conditions. The elevated temperature is employed to increase extraction efficiency of the analyte of interest and the elevated pressure is used to keep the solvent in a liquid state as the temperature is increased above its boiling point. An automated system for the process was developed by Dionex, a company owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific.  Method  The extraction cell is filled with the solid sample to be examined and placed in a temperature-controllable oven. After adding the solvent, the cell is heated at constant pressure (adjustable between 0.3 and 20 MPa) up to a maximum temperature of 200°C and kept at constant conditions for a while so that equilibrium can be established. The extract is then transferred to a sample tube. A sample often goes through several extraction cycles. Finally, the extraction cell is rinsed with solvent, the rinsing valve is opened and the cell and all lines are rinsed with nitrogen and the apparatus is prepared for further extractions.  Applications  Accelerated solvent extraction has found many applications in the food industry, including in: * The testing of dietary seafoods for arsenic content * Extraction of catechins from green tea samples * Authentication of natural vanilla flavors * The analysis of terpenoids and sterols in tobacco  See also  * Supercritical fluid extraction * Superheated water  References  Category:Analytical chemistry Category:Extraction (chemistry) ","title":"Accelerated solvent extraction"},{"id":"50484202","title":"2016 Caribbean Premier League squads"},{"id":"50484210","text":"Jonathan Judge-Russo (born January 19, 1983) is an American actor and producer.

Garden waste is the accumulated plant matter from gardening activities which involve cutting or removing vegetation, i.e. cutting the lawn, weed removal, hedge trimming or pruning consisting of lawn clippings. leaf matter, wood and soil. The composition and volume of garden waste can vary from season to season and location to location. A study in Aarhus, Denmark, found that on average, garden waste generation per person ranged between 122 kg to 155 kg per year. Garden waste may be used to create compost or mulch, which can be used as a soil conditioner, adding valuable nutrients and building humus. The creation of compost requires a balance between, nitrogen, carbon, moisture and oxygen. Without the ideal balance, plant matter may take a long time to break down, drawing nitrogen from other sources, reducing nitrogen availability to existing vegetation which requires it for growth. The risk of dumping garden waste is that it may contain seeds and plant parts that may grow (propagules), as well as increase fire fuel loads, disrupt visual amenity, accrue economic costs associated with the removal of waste as well as costs associated with the mitigation of associated impacts such as weed control, forest fire. Cause There are strong links between weed invasion of natural areas and the proximity and density of housing. The size and duration of the community have a direct relation to the density of weed infestation. Of the various means in which migration of exotic species from gardens take place, such as vegetative dispersal of runners, wind born and fallen seed, garden waste dumping can play a significant role. The results of one North German study found that of the problematic population of Fallopia, app. 29% originated from garden waste. Of a population of Heracleum mantegazzianum, 18% was found by Schepker to be generated by garden waste (as cited by Kowarik & von der Lippe, 2008) pg 24–25. An Australia government publication suggest that some of the main reasons for the dumping of garden waste can be attributed to lack of care for the environment, convenience, or a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. 2013). People dump garden waste to avoid disposal fees at landfill sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. This activity is carried out by people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses, such as professional landscapers and gardeners. The spread of exotic vegetation can out-compete locally endemic vegetation, altering the composition and structure of an ecosystem. Dumping of garden waste in particular facilitates the spread of exotic vegetation into forest remnants via the introduction of seeds and propagules contained within the garden waste. Common selection criteria for home gardeners when choosing plants are often based on ease of propagation, suitability to local environmental conditions and novelty. These specific chosen characteristics increase the chance of plant parts and seeds that are introduced into forested areas becoming a problem. The three major causes of animal habitat degradation are; the disruption or loss of ecosystem functions, the loss of food resources and loss of resident species. Non-native invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through competition, pest and disease transportation and habitat and ecosystem alteration. The dumping of garden waste in nature reserves surrounding and near urban areas increases the risk of fires. The dumped garden waste will eventually dry out creating fuel adding to already fallen debris fuel load on which a fire can thrive and spread on. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds build fuel for fires. Dumped garden waste can facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.Department of Environment and Heritage Protection. (2016). Ehp.qld.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/ With no root systems for stabilisation the top soil is vulnerable to erosion (Ritter, J. 2015), This can add higher levels of sediments, contributing to the siltation of creeks and waterways. If plant matter gets into waterways it can create reduced oxygen levels through the process of decomposition of green waste such as lawn clippings. This directly upsets the quality of water, affecting fish and aquatic wildlife. This dumping of green waste can also lead to the blocking of drainage systems; directly through the build-up of plant debris, and indirectly through the spread of invasive plant species that colonise wet areas, reducing and or changing the flow of waterways. This change in flow, including path and velocity, can alter hydrological cycles, affecting frequency and intensity of floods. Impact Green and garden waste has a direct impact to the visual aesthetics of land and can often attract further illegal dumping. =Increased fire risk= Dumping garden waste in nature reserves and parks surrounding and near urban areas can effect directly and indirectly the existing flora and fauna, as well as human life through the increased risk of fires. The dumped garden waste will eventually dry, creating additional fuel, adding to already fallen debris on which a fire can thrive and spread. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds also build fuel for fires. Fires may also spread to the suburban areas where humans can also be impacted by losing their homes from fire, incur injury or death from smoke or burns, and suffer economic loses such as income loss and clean-up costs. Fires can lead to an overall loss of habitat and biodiversity. =Threat to biodiversity= The invasion of exotic plant species into remnant native forests is a threat to biodiversity. Some impacts of habitat degradation include; when native animals, insects and birds become vulnerable and put at risk; loss of food source for native wildlife; disruption of native plant-animal relationships ie pollination and seed dispersal and disconnection of plant-host relationships. Highly adaptive plants chosen for their ease of cultivation out compete more specialised species. Weed invasion of a forest system can change the processes of plant succession (the system of one species replacing another due to disturbance factors), the composition of the plant community and the composition and availability of nutrients. The change in forest composition can lead to loss of unique plant species. When a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and extinction becomes a threat. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem. The term 'hotspot' is used to describe areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and facing high potential of habitat degradation. The 25 most significant hotspots contain the habitats of 133,149 plant species (44% of all plant species worldwide; table 1) and 9,645 vertebrate species (35% of all vertebrate worldwide; table 2). These endemics are confined to an expanse of 2.1 million square kilometers (1.4% of land surface). Having lost 88% of their primary vegetation, they formerly occupied 17.4 million square kilometers or 11.8% of land surface. The recruitment of alien invasive species may lead to a homogenisation of landscapes. Although increased bio diversity in subregions created by newly introduced species may occur, the displacement of the existing plant species may lead to reduced biodiversity on a global scale. When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13–24 (42–77%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales. =Waterways quality= The dumping of green waste such as lawn clippings can block drainage systems which pollutes water therefore effecting water quality and the health of aquatic plants and animals. Dumped garden waste can add high levels of sediments, reducing the light available for photosynthesis. Dumping also block waterways and roads, cause flooding and facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover. Causes / stakeholders Illegal dumping is carried out by all types of people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses and other organizations. Addressing these motivations will enable strategies to be developed that deal with the root causes, rather than the results, of illegal dumping. Some of the main reasons for this careless disregard for waste can be put down to sheer convenience, lack of care for the environment and also a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. The monitoring of illegally dumped garden waste by the community and industries will drive effectual tactics to battle illegal depositing. People dump waste illegally to avoid disposal fees at landfill sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb.) is an introduced weed originating from Sri Lanka and is creating major issues throughout the Australia since its introduction into the country. Alligator weed has the potential to affect aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity severely and to cause considerable social and economic costs, particularly in aquatic situations. Mitigation Education on the value of biodiversity and the negative effects of weed invasion have been identified as key items in changing current trends. Specific education campaigns on the risks of dumping garden waste could be targeted at high-risk societal groups such as residents of housing in close proximity to reserves as well as members of gardening communities and plant sellers. Restricting the selection of garden species in new housing developments adjacent to reserves may reduce the effects of illegal dumping, thereby reducing requirement and associated cost of weed management. Creating habitat for wildlife by planting native plants, making a water source available, provide shelter and places to raise young.National Wildlife Federation. (2016). Nwf.org. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.nwf.org/ Healthy ecosystems are necessary for the survival and health of all organisms, and there are a number of ways to reduce negative impact on the environment. Cultivation of native plant species may benefit not only native plant populations but also native animal populations. For example, Sears & Anderson suggest that native bird species diversity in Australia and North America tend to match the volume and diversity of native vegetation. Crisp also explains the percentage of native insect species in a fauna has been found to be consistent with the percentage of native plant species. Composting is a great way to recycle nutrients back into soils. Mulching the garden with leaves and clippings (BMCC, n.d). Fostering an appreciation of local natural environmental features and plant species may also help mitigate the issue. as well as the restriction of highly invasive plant species through international policy.IUCN. 2000. Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species. http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Policy Utilization of green waste bins that are provided by some councils or shires that are emptied via curbside collection (BMCC. n.d). The addition of facilities for waste disposal could also improve the issue (DECC. 2008). Mitigation may involve governments holding campaigns that show people disposing legally and reporting the consequences for disposing illegally.Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste- landfills.pdf A way Australian governments are addressing the problem is through the increase of fines in conjunction with better law enforcement. In Australia, fines can be up to $1,000,000 and can also incur imprisonment. The Protection of the Environment Operations Act imposes penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility.Increased penalties for illegal waste dumping in NSW - Colin Biggers & Paisley. (2016). Cbp.com.au. Retrieved 21 May 2016, from http://www.cbp.com.au/publications/2013/november/increased- penalties-for-illegal-waste-dumping-in-n =Australia= The new section of the POEO Act (The Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997) now imposes further penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility (Parrino, Maysaa, Kaoutarani & Salam, 2014). Communities are encouraged to report illegal dumping. In accordance with NSW Illegal Dumping Strategy 2014–16, hefty fines and a maximum jail sentence of 2 years can be handed down to repeat offenders.

The area is part of an ongoing restoration project, it also provides habitat to wildlife and offers nearby recreation opportunities. The area is prone to drought, erosion, species invasion, fire, and groups of transient populations.http://www.sfestuary.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/29-Habitat-Restoration-Wetland-and-Riparian.pdf In the American River Parkway Plan, the lake is designated as a Nature Study Area and further protected by the Bushy Lake Preservation Act.  Location  Bushy Lake is a small lake located in the American River Parkway at 38.5889279°N, 121.4345277°W. It is behind the southeast corner of Cal Expo in the city and county of Sacramento, California, in the United States. The lake is located just off a trail, half a mile from the parking area near Gate 12 of Cal Expo and 700 meters from the American River.  History  In the 1940s the State of California acquired the undeveloped land near Cal Expo that Bushy Lake is a part of. A structure was built in the 1960s, followed by development for a golf course. To prepare for the golf course, the structure of the depression that forms Bushy Lake was changed and compacted, altering its shape and bathymetry. The development of the Golf Course was halted by efforts from the Save the American River Association and support of the Bushy Lake Preservation Act, with the intent of protecting the remaining riparian area. The work on the golf course stopped when the act was passed in 1976, today the land is currently owned by Cal Expo and managed by Sacramento County parks. Historically the area surrounding Bushy Lake, which is in the floodplain of the American River, would accommodate the natural meandering of the river. Since the construction of Folsom Dam, flow into the lower American River has been controlled. Because of this controlled release, the river no longer reaches its historic floodplains. Today the water in Bushy Lake is supplied by groundwater pumped from Cal Expo, in accordance with the Bushy Lake Preservation Act. California's Mediterranean climate, consisting of cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers is also connected to drought conditions, which cause many locations in California to be prone to fire. Bushy Lake is no different, In the summer of 2014, 160 acres of land surrounding Bushy Lake burned in a wildfire. There was another fire in the area in 2016. One of the main objectives of the current restoration project is to develop a fire resilient understory. = Bushy Lake Preservation Act and AB 889 = The Bushy Lake Preservation Act was enacted in 1976 and the primary intent of the act was to support the ecosystems in the area by supporting the habitat of flora and fauna. The Bushy Lake Preservation Act is a legislative act that requires the flood plains to be maintained and preserved for public use and enjoyment. Assembly Bill 889 makes amendments to the Bushy Lake Preservation Act by expanding on some of the requirements of the original act. The California Exposition and State Fair Board of Directors are required to maintain and preserve Bushy Lake and the Cal Expo floodplains in a way that is consistent with what a state park and natural preserve are. Assembly Bill 889 also requires that the preservation and management of Bushy Lake and the flood plains of Cal Expo conform to the standards and regulations of the American River Parkway Plan. The Bushy Lake Preservation Act also only allows that parking is to be permitted during the time of the State Fair and only on specified land, however, AB 889 requires one acre of land to be designated at all times for public use as long as cars are not parked there for more than 34 days. In addition, AB 889 requires that about 11 acres of land to be specifically for the use of parking near the flood plains so that more of the public can have access.  The Bushy Lake Restoration Project  The Environmental Studies department at CSUS has an ongoing restoration project that aims to restore the riparian habitat of Bushy Lake . The Bushy Lake Restoration Project is a long-term collaborative education project between the CSUS Environmental Studies Department and the Sacramento County Parks Department. The project was initiated at the Ecological Society of America Conference in Sacramento by multiple organizations including Yale, University of California, Davis, Sacramento County Parks, and the American River Parkway Foundation in August 2014.http://www.csus.edu/envs/Documents/Bushy%20Lake%20Executive%20Summary%202015.pdf The goals of the project are to restore fire resilient and drought resistant native plants to the area, to restore habitat for local native animals, as well as provide environmental educational opportunities for the public. = Plant survival research = One of the main objectives of the restoration project is to develop a fire resilient understory. To accomplish this, research must be done to determine best planting and propagation practices for the site. Research has been done on two fire resilient species- Santa Barbara sedge (Carex barbarae) and creeping wild rye (Leymus triticoides) regarding planting densities, which showed that the low-density plantings were more cost effective and that these plants survive better when planted separately. Ongoing research of understory vegetation working as an umbrella species and companion planting is underway. = Western pond turtle research = Western pond turtles and Red-eared sliders have both been identified as residing in Bushy Lake. In 2017 the number of Western pond turtles was greater than the number of red-eared sliders, which only accounted for 10% of recorded sightings. The red-eared slider is an invasive species that competes with the western pond turtle for basking sites and food resources. Counts from 2018 suggest that there are now more red-eared sliders in the lake than Western pond turtles. Further plans to remove and relocate the red-eared sliders to a sanctuary and tag the Western pond turtles are underway. = Bird sampling = Bird sampling at Bushy Lake is done using a point bird count method, consisting of being in designated areas for 15 minutes and recording and identifying what birds are seen or heard. Counts have been used to compile lists of avian species using the site for breeding purposes, foraging, or just passing by. The counts are on-going, in an effort to determine what species use the site year-round. = Valley elderberry longhorn beetle monitoring = The valley elderberry longhorn beetle is a threatened species known to be found in elderberry trees along the American River. Bushy Lake and the surrounding area contain several elderberry trees that have been marked and checked for the beetle's exit holes. When exit holes are found it indicates the presence of the beetle in that tree. The monitoring process has not resulted in any confirmed sightings or new exit holes from the valley elderberry longhorn beetles.  Flora and fauna  Wildlife spotted at Bushy Lake include:the western pond turtle, North American River Otter, red tailed hawks, Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetles, the Willow Flycatcher, and many other bird species. Bushy Lake is a wetland riparian plant community. As a result of different stressors, such as fire and drought, there has been an increase in the biomass of invasive species in the area that prosper in drought-like conditions. A vegetation survey of the area revealed native and non-native species present at Bushy Lake, 52% are native to the area and include trees, bushes, and herbaceous understory including: beardless wild rye (Elymus triticoides) and Santa Barbara sedge (Carex barbarae), elderberry (Sambucus Mexicana), coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis), California blackberry (Rubus ursinus), California grape (Vitis californica), sandbar willow (Salix exigua), arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), Goodding’s willow (Salix gooddingii), box elder (Acer negundo), and Fremont’s cottonwood (Populus fremontii). 48% of the species found are non-native, of that 48%, 39% are invasive species such as: Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), and prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola). Invasive species crowd out the native plant species, making it harder for the natives to get the resources they need; this negatively effects the biodiversity of Bushy Lake.  Recreation  Bushy Lake is located near the American River Bike Trail. There are also fishing opportunities both in the lake and in the nearby American River. People who fish are asked to submit reviews about the fish and wildlife that they encounter. This area is used for bird watching, bike riding, equestrian riding, hiking, and picnicking in addition to accessing the river. Bushy Lake also offers organized volunteer opportunities that include weeding and prepping sites for future research.

The Castle of San Jorge was a medieval fortress built on the west bank of the Guadalquivir river in the Spanish city of Seville (Spain). It was also used as headquarters and prison for the Spanish Inquisition. It was demolished in the 19th century and made into a food market. A museum in the underground ruins focuses on the history of the castle, the Spanish Inquisition and of religious repression. Next to the food market in the Barrio de Triana, the Alley of the Inquisition, which was part of the fortifications, now connects Castilla Street with the Nuestra Señora de la O Walk.  History  Castle of San Jorge in the city of Seville, facing the Guadalquivir river. The Visigoths created a fortification in the area next to the river to defend Spalis, the Visigoth name for Seville. During the Almohad domain in 1171, Jucef Abu Jacub, king of Isbilia, ordered the construction of the Puente de barcas (Bridge of Boats), a floating bridge laid over a row of boats, to link the east and west shores. That bridge was chained to what was then called the Castle of Gabir. In the same year, the king funneled water from the Guadalquivir from the castle to the inner city, spending a huge sum of money. He ordered the construction of the Alcazar, the Buhaira palace and the fortress of Alcalá de Guadaíra. He was defeated by Afonso I of Portugal at the Siege of Santarém (1184), in which he died. Ferdinand III of Castile, with the help of the fleet of Ramón de Bonifaz, broke the chains and with it the barrier of the bridge. This helped Ferdinand III to take the city in 1248. Up until 1280, the castle belonged to the Military Order of Saint George of Alfama, patron of knights and soldiers. =From Castle of Triana to Castle of San Jorge= In 1246, Seville and Granada were the only major cities in the Iberian Peninsula that had not fallen to Christian rule. During the summer of 1247, Castilian armies isolated Seville to the north and east. This paved the way for the siege, which started when Ramón de Bonifaz sailed with thirteen galleys and some smaller ships up the Guadalquivir and scattered his opposition. On May 3, the Castilian fleet broke the pontoon bridge linking Seville and Triana. Due to the subsequent famine the Muslims had no choice but to surrender. The city capitulated on November 23, 1248. They signed Ferdinand III's requirements under which they should leave the \\"whole\\" city with its buildings and land \\"libre et quita.\\" The terms also specified that the Castillian troops would be allowed to enter the alcázar no later than a month later. During that time, the city was prepared to be occupied, mosques were purified (so that they could become Christian temples) as well as the places where the Christian armies would settle; they reserved the best houses for the lords and chiefs. Once this term was over, the Moorish king Axataf handed the keys of the city to King Ferdinand. The city was then empty for three days. Ferdinand made his triumphant entry into the city on December 22, 1248. King Ferdinand III put above the tower of the castle, the Pendón de San Fernando. After taking possession of the city, they proceeded to distribute things in the same way as before, according to Castilian laws, customs and uses of the time. It was understood that a conquered city belonged to the conqueror, and in this case to the crown, by \\"right of conquest.\\" The distribution was made between members of the royal family, princes, bishops, knights, rich men, military orders, religious orders, good men and laborers; all those who had taken part in the success. Military orders received houses and properties located all within the city walls, with the exception of the Order of St. George of Alfama, whose knights were given the Castle of Triana. Triana was named \\"Guarda de Sevilla\\" (Guardian of Seville). Saint George and James I of Aragon at the Battle of the Puig by Andrés Marzal de Sas The Order of St. George of Alfama was not a military order in the style of the orders already established, like the Temple, the Hospitaller, Calatrava and Santiago born in the heat of the Reconquista (Reconquest), and whose primary purpose of defending Christianity was the attack of the infidels. The Order of St. George had more modest aims: to defend against the Saracens in the coastal zone, and the zone's re population. The king considered that a river bank was a coast of a river, and that to guard the banks of the Guadalquivir fitted the rule of this order; and so he gave them the castle, renamed the Castle of San Jorge, as his part of the deal. Among the activities at the castle was the veneration of their patron (Saint George) through cults and religious celebrations, for which rose a chapel that over the years became the first parish of Triana. That is, the temple of St. George's parish was none other than the knights' chapel inside the castle. This is also the origin of the trianera devotion to St. George. However, the people of the thirteenth century did not feel very attracted to this Order, whose task was to defend the coast. They did not consider this a prestigious activity, especially when other Militias like Malta, Calatrava or the Temple were given the opportunity to enjoy broad military glory and immunities. Therefore, the Order of St. George of Alfama led a nondescript life for more than a century. According to the chronicles, although their knights were men of well-proven value in war, they led a somewhat relaxed life in peaceful times. In 1400, the Order of St. George of Alfama disappeared, and was absorbed by the powerful Order of Montesa. This, and that the importance of the castle as a defensive element decreased over the years, explains why during the second half of the 15th century the Castle of San Jorge experienced a period of neglect. The abandoned castle was delivered in 1481 to the newly created Inquisition, who used it as a headquarters and prison. =Headquarters of the Court of the Inquisition= The Catholic Monarchs with a Grand Inquisitor in 1492.

Pietro Torrigiano's death in the Castle of San Jorge of Seville. Engraving of the 19th century. When the Inquisition began in Seville, they needed more space for their dungeons. Since the Castle of San Jorge was unused, it was a very apparent place for those duties and it was ceded to it by the Court. The Inquisition originally intended to suppress heresy within the Catholic Church itself, ensuring its spiritual purity. But the \\"Modern Inquisition\\" established in Seville, contrary to what is believed, was an independent institution of the Church, to prosecute false Christians and heretics. It was created by the Catholic Monarchs and began operating in Seville in 1481, with the converts strongly opposed to the establishment of the Court. Since Seville as was an amalgam of cultures, with remarkable Judeo-Moorish minorities and a large commercial center open to traffic of all nations, it was an ideal place for the presence and distribution of non-Catholic ideologies. An archbishop of Seville, Pedro González de Mendoza, was the true founder of the Modern Inquisition. The Christians accused of heresy were forbidden to appeal to Rome, so that the \\"religious control\\" became independent controlled outside the papal curia. The Tribunal of the Holy Office began with its headquarters at the convent of San Pablo of the Dominicans (present church of la Magdalena) who, because of the rivalry that it maintained with the Franciscan Order, and risking its prestige, had no problem in turning their convent into a temporary prison for the men and women \\"most guilty\\" of heresy. However, it soon had to move to the Castle of San Jorge where there was more rrom for the dungeons, where the judges and officers \\"of this holy office\\" lived. However, given the direction that the inquisitorial bureaucracy was taking, it did not have much space in the castle: due to the fact that two of the inquisitors had harsh differences and there were jealousies caused by the one-man office of one of the notaries. The essential work of the Holy Office was to pursue and prosecute the false converts. The real inquisition was held at the Castle of San Jorge: it was where the inmates were kept, where the Court subjected them to \\"interrogation,\\" and where they awaited execution and sentencing. Instead, the sentenced were held in so-called \\"life imprisonment\\" that was in El Salvador. The jail was unhealthy, both wet or hot, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the cell's floor. The secret prisons were divided into high and low cells. The Castle of San Jorge was a feared and hated place among other things, because its walls served as shelter to criminals who had committed a crime, but as they were friends or relatives of the Inquisition, enjoyed immunity. Also the Inquisition had collaboration of the \\"familiars,\\" a kind of police who enjoyed the privileges of escaping the jurisdiction of other courts, and were also authorized to carry weapons. Although expressly prohibited such excesses, the \\"servants of the Inquisition\\" and the \\"right of asylum\\" continued to commit crimes under the pretext of immunity. The Auto-da- fés that were held in Seville took place first on the steps of the Cathedral, and then in the Plaza de San Francisco, although many of them occurred in the Church of Santa Ana. On the other hand, the Auto-da-fés were considered a party by the people, and a large crowd came that used to participate in an angry way around the complicated ceremony. According to Giorgio Vasari, the Florentine artist Pietro Torrigiano was arrested by the Inquisition, and died in the Castle of San Jorge in 1522 in a kind of hunger strike, although it is possible that this story is apocryphal. The Inquisition left the castle in 1626, due to the continued deterioration of its walls due to heavy flooding. After that, it was loaned to the Count-Duke of Olivares, in which he dealt with its repairs and care, and the surveillance of goods carried to its doorstep. Later given to the city, City Hall demolished the castle in the 19th century. It was destroyed to widen the space to connect the Altozano with Castilla street and to create a grain warehouse. Around 1830, on the occasion of the traveling market that spontaneously formed in its surroundings, a food market was built that continues today. The Alley of the Inquisition (Callejón de la Inquisición), located at the confluence of the Castilla, San Jorge y Callao streets, is evidence of the presence of the old inquisitorial court in Triana.  The Castle today  Remains of a kitchen of the castle, in the museum located on its site. In 1823 the Mercado de Triana was built on the site of the castle, which remains in operation today. Beneath the market numerous archaeological excavations were carried out, which concluded that the remains should be in a museum. In 2009 the City Hall of Seville inaugurated the Castillo de San Jorge project, thus creating an interpretation center for the ruins and the religious repression that the Spanish Inquisition conducted.  Scenario of Fidelio by Beethoven  In 1805, Ludwig van Beethoven premiered his opera Fidelio about a Sevillian prison which held prisoners of conscience in the late-18th century. While he didn't specifically name it in the text, it is very likely that the composer meant the castle of San Jorge. In recent years, Seville has attempted to monetize its operatic past with an initiative called Sevilla Ciudad de Ópera (Spanish for \\"Seville City of Opera\\"). This has included Castle tours about the operatic heritage of Seville, and a commemorative plaque installed at the site.

Toward the end of his life, Percoraro related how he had deceived many famous people, including the novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (who was easily fooled); he also wrote a confession in which he admitted that all his phenomena were faked.\\" Pecoraro from Naples worked as a spiritualist medium. He claimed his spirit guide was Eusapia Palladino, a deceased medium.Christopher, Milbourne. (1975). Mediums, Mystics & the Occult. Thomas Y. Crowell. pp. 189-190. The psychical researcher Hereward Carrington introduced Pecoraro to the spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle in America. Pecoraro who was tied up during a séance by Carrington, managed to impress Doyle by making musical instruments play.Christopher, Milbourne. (1998). Houdini. Gramercy Books. p. 137 Carrington persuaded Pecoraro to participate in the Scientific American contest. In four days in December, 1923 he was tested by members of the committee. He was tied to a chair with sixty feet of rope. Beside him was placed a table with musical instruments. During the séances various movements and sounds of objects were heard. He had managed to impress some of the committee members who considered the phenomena genuine. However, O. D. Munn, the publisher of the Scientific American, suspected that he had freed his hand to play the instruments. The magician Harry Houdini had not been informed of the test sessions, but managed to get to the fourth séance. Houdini suggested that Percorao was an escape artist who freed himself from the rope that bound him to his chair. Before the séance, Houdini had cut the rope into shorter pieces and tied Pecoraro to the chair. Because of the tight control, no phenomena occurred. In 1931, Pecoraro confessed his fraud in a newspaper interview.Kahn, Ely Jacques. (1979). Far-Flung and Footloose: Pieces from the New Yorker, 1937-1978. Putnam Publishing Group. p. 59 Later in life he became an artist. Two of his paintings are on exhibit at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA.  References  External links *Another Medium Exposed.

Their motherland has always been a major inspiration which is portrayed in their work. The love for their language and culture is aimed to bring back the departed old identity and to produce quality work in order to sensitize the world in general and the youth in specific about the grace of Sindhi language. Saif Samejo Saif Samejo is founder and lead vocalist of the Pakistani Sufi/Folk/Rock band The Sketches. In May 2014 he has opened the first music Aashram (School) in Hyderabad, Sindh named as \\"Lahooti Music Aashram\\". With a consistency The Sketches climbed up the ladder of success in not just parts of Sindh but the entire Pakistan with popular hits; Nind Nashe Vich, Rano, Raat, Main Sufi Hoon, Meena. Recently a new music album YOU () and a new song Jogi was launched. Saif collaborated with Mai Dhai to present the original Rajasthani flavor of music besides this he also intended to collaborate with other artist through Lahooti Music Ashram. =Lahooti Live Sessions= Lahooti Live Sessions launched by Saif Samejo in June 2013, is a weekly activity where different musicians from Sindh gather at Samejo's place to play live music.The audio and video of the performances is recorded and released on social media. Samejo himself is the front man of the Jamshoro-based rock band The Sketches, and the Lahooti Sessions are in the vein of something that he has wanted to do for a long time; cultural preservation in its most unadulterated form. Lahooti live sessions appears as a dream come true for him. \\"The aim was not only to record these musicians, but to do so in the highest possible audio-visual quality so that they can be presented in an equally good manner on social media,\\" Samejo adds. Around 50 different folk musicians have been recorded and released as part of the Lahooti live sessions and most of them have never been exposed to the camera or the recording equipment before. Some prominent names include Mai Dhai, Zulfiqar Fakir, Arieb Azhar, band Bell, two Changg players from Thatta – Ali Mohammad and Feroz Roonjho, Manjhi Faqeer, Talib Talari, Mai Hanjoo and Mohammad Hassan. =Lahooti Music Aashram= The Lahooti School of music is an extension of the Lahooti Live Sessions that Saif started a year ago, with the intent of preserving indigenous instruments and instrumentalists. Lahooti music School named as Lahooti Music Aashram is the first proper music School in Hyderabad/Jamshoro inaugurated in May 2014. The school offers a thirty-six-hour learning module in keyboards, guitars, bass guitars and drums amongst western instruments and chung, boreendo, shehnai, danbooro, sarangi, narr, sitar, flute and dholak/tabla, along with other percussion instruments closer to home. Later on the students who show interest in the field of music production will also be provided with studio facilities to harness their skills. Music =Albums= =Dastkari= Their first album ‘Dastkari’ meaning ‘one’s own creation’ was released in 2010 with the Folk/Sufi/Rock songs in Sindhi, Saraiki and Urdu bearing a wide range of messages promoting peace, a rich cultural heritage, freedom of expression and love. The music created by The Sketches has proved the fact that \\"Music has no language\\", despite the fact that different languages have been used in their songs listeners from different age groups and backgrounds have appreciated each flavor that come out. The music blends so perfectly, creating novel symphonies that capture the soul. =YOتون= The Band released their second full-length album YOU () in 2016. Since 2015, the band was busy working on their second album – this album. Saif says this album doesn't just reflect their musical journey but the spiritual growth of the artistes as well. \\"These were the years of reflection, of contemplation, of growth,\\" says Saif. \\"The world was only getting more divided, more isolated. If we were to find meaning of life we were find it here, in our everyday reality no matter how harsh that be. We couldn't wait for the world to get better. But once this realization struck us, we were suddenly able to appreciate the small joys of life with more gratitude. We were able to celebrate the brief moments of love and cherish them as long as they last. YOU, album is an effort to celebrate those moments, the moments of love and beatitude, that float by unnoticed in our everyday lives.

It consists of three platforms, descending from west to east (i.e. the westernmost platform is also the highest). The site is reached by travelling along the SS 117 Gela-Catania, taking the turn-off for Piazza Armerina, driving for 9 kilometres, until a side road appears on the left, the old road to Mazzarino, marked by a sign which shows the street on an ancient Roman route map known as the Itinerarium Antonini.Salvatore Piccolo, op.cit., p. 9 et seq. The shape of the hill, from a geological point of view, is relatively recent, with the Miocene limestone base covered by Pleistocene marl with silt and quartz grains, then finally by very red sand which is very crumbly and dusty.

It enables to verify the authorship of a declaration in electronic data exchange over long periods of time. Qualified electronic signatures can be considered as digital equivalent to handwritten signatures. Description The purpose of eIDAS was to create a set of standards to ensure that electronic signatures could be used in a secure manner while conducting business online or while conducting official business across borders between EU member states. The qualified electronic signature is one such standard that has been outlined under eIDAS. A qualified electronic signature is an advanced electronic signature with a qualified digital certificate that has been created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). For an electronic signature to be considered as a qualified electronic signature, it must meet three main requirements: First, the signatory must be linked and uniquely identified to the signature. The second point is that data used to create the signature must be under the sole control of the signatory. And last it must have the ability to identify if the data that accompanies the signature has been tampered with since the signing of the message. It is important to note that creating a qualified electronic signature is more than merely adding a qualified certificate to an advanced electronic signature. The signature must also be created using a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). This device is responsible for qualifying digital signatures by using specific hardware and software that ensures that the signatory only has control of their private key. In addition, a qualified trust service provider manages the signature creation data that is produced. The signature creation data must remain unique, confidential and protected from forgery. Qualified electronic signatures that comply with eIDAS may be technically implemented through three specific digital signature standards XAdES, PAdES and CAdES that were developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and then need to be complemented with a qualified digital certificate through the procedures described above:  Qualified trust service providers The qualified trust service provider has a crucial role in the process of qualified electronic signing. A trust service provider must receive qualified status from a supervisory governmental body that allows the entity to provide qualified trust services to be used in creating qualified electronic signatures. Regulated in eIDAS, the European Union published an EU Trust List with constitutive effect, meaning that a provider or service will only be qualified if it appears in the Trusted List. Qualified trust service providers are required to abide by the strict guidelines outlined under the eIDAS Regulation, which include as part of the certificate creation process: * The service provider must provide a valid time and date for created certificates. * Signatures that have expired certificates must be revoked immediately. * Personnel employed by the qualified trust service provider must be appropriately trained. * Software and hardware used by the service provider must be trustworthy and capable of preventing certificate forgery. Vision and expected impact Under eIDAS, the intent of the implementation of qualified electronic signatures is to serve several purposes, such as the facilitation of business and public services processes, including those that go across borders. These processes can be safely expedited using electronic signing. Under eIDAS, EU member states have been charged with establishing \\"points of single contact\\" (PSCs) for trust services to ensure that electronic ID schemes may be used in cross-border public sector transactions, such as exchanging and accessing healthcare information across borders. Previously, a signatory would sign a document or message and then return it to the intended recipient via the postal service, facsimile service, by hand or by scanning and then attaching it to an email. The issue with these methods is that they are not always secure or timely. Delays in delivery could occur, and there exists the possibility that signatures could be forged or the enclosed documents may be altered. The risk increases as multiple signatures are required from different people who may be located in different locations. These problems are alleviated by using qualified electronic signatures, which save time, are legally binding, and provide a higher level of technical security. The increased transparency in the electronic signing and transaction process and the enhanced interoperability are expected to spur innovation in the European internal market. Legal implications eIDAS requires that no electronic signature should be denied legal effect or admissibility as evidence solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures.eIDAS article 25 The qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect as a handwritten signature. Its evidentiary value depends on the circumstances, but will normally be considered very high.eIDAS does not explicitly address the evidentiary value of qualified electronic certificates, but it states that qualified electronic seals should enjoy the presumption of the integrity of the data and of the correctness of the origin of that data to which the seal is linked (article 35 (2)). Qualified electronic signatures and seals are technically very similar. All EU member states are required to recognize a qualified electronic signature as valid, as long as it has been created with a qualified certificate that has been issued by another member state. Under eIDAS Regulation, Article 27, Electronic signatures in public services, member states are prohibited from requesting signatures of a higher level than qualified electronic signature. Article 25 (2) of eIDAS allows a qualified electronic signature to carry the same legal weight as a handwritten signature.

The Initiative has achieved significant progress toward its goals. There has been a dramatic decline in cases everywhere in the seventeen years since the target was set in 1988. Its volunteers throughout the world have helped organize national immunization days, staffed health stations and have given drops to children. Rotarians have helped leverage a further US$6.7 billion from the governments the-world-over for this cause. In India, since the campaign was launched, the polio disease incidence has reduced to ‘zero' at present. Indian Rotarians are also contributing to the program by donating large funds. During every NID /SNID, Indian Rotarians are seen volunteering by manning polio booths and administering polio drops to children.  Projects  India Rotary’s India National PolioPlus society (INPPS) has actively been involved in social mobilization, media management, and political, bureaucratic and religious advocacy to make Polio immunization widely acceptable; successfully gaining access to children who have never been reached before is an integral component of Rotary PolioPlus commitment. Nearly 7000 polio-inflicted children have been operated upon and rehabilitated through 82 camps held in different endemic states of the country. Similarly, free health camps are being organized by Rotary in different districts to cater to the urgent health needs of the people including polio immunization. In 2010, with an increasing threat of a virus outbreak in Ludhiana, Malegaon, Murshidabad, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Rotary Task Force Committee were formed. The state governments were supported with materials such as vaccine carriers, marker pens, cap/aprons, and cold boxes. Free general health camps in affected districts were conducted. Rotary also makes extensive use of various IEC materials, such as comic books, video vans, banners, and posters, etc. to publicize the cause of polio eradication.

Political front  right INPPS has garnered political support for the program by involving the President, the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, Health Ministers and local politicians in the program. Rotary also enlisted bureaucratic support by involving the Cabinet Secretary, the Chief Secretary, the Principal Secretary, District Magistrates and other health officials in the polio campaign. Rotary approached senior minority leaders such as the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid and the President of All India Muslim Personal Law Board and was successful in enlisting their support. Further INPPC formed a Rotary Muslim Ulema Committee in the state of Uttar Pradesh, consisting of senior Muslim scholars and religious leaders to address issues of resistance among the Muslim population and appeal to Muslim parents to immunize children against Polio. Today, this Ulema Committee that Rotary helped set up in the State is a vital resource that the U.P. Govt. and other social organizations seek intervention from time to time for their ongoing programs to bring about an overall improvement in the social-economic life of the minority community.  Contributions and achievements  Humanitarian organizations world over are partnering with Rotary International in their biggest humanitarian initiative to rid the world of Polio. In a major boost to the eradication campaign, the Gates Foundation contributed a whopping US$355 million. Rotary International accepted to raise US$200 million against the Gates Foundation grant by June 2012. Rotary help raise the matching grant exceeding the challenge. On 13 January 2012, India surpassed one year without detecting a single case of poliovirus. On 27 March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to certify India as a polio free country, marking more than three years since the last case of polio there. India had traditionally been considered one of the toughest places in the world to eradicate polio. In 2009, India reported 741 polio cases, more than any other country in the world. In 2010, India reported just 42 cases out of 1,352 cases reported globally. Google.org, inspired by Rotary's efforts donated a sum of US$3.5 million to the Polio eradication effort worldwide to Rotary Foundation. In India, the Aditya Birla Group with its patron Rajashree Birla, who is an honorary member of Rotary Club Mumbai has contributed US$9 million. Usha Mittal (of Arcellor Mittal Group) has donated to Rotary a total contribution of US$1.5 million towards Polio eradication fund. And, Harshad Mehta, chairman of Rosy Blue Diamond has contributed more than US$3.5 million. In January 2014, India completed three years without a case of Polio and along with 10 SEAR countries was awarded the Southeast Asia Regional Polio-free certification by WHO on 27 March 2014. Rotary is supplying material to Government of India to improve upon the Rotary Immunization level.

He was a member of the French Resistance during World War II and suffered incarceration in Buchenwald concentration camp of the Nazis. His contributions were reported in making Schlumberger into the market leader in oilfield services sector. The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1986, for his contributions to society.  Biography  Jean Riboud, born on 15 November 1919 in the French city of Lyons to a banker, graduated from Ecole des Sciences Politiques, Paris in 1939. He was involved with politics from his student years and was a supporter of the Popular Front coalition government of Leon Blum. Later, he started his career as a lieutenant in the French Army and after serving the army for a while, he joined the French Resistance. It was during this period he was captured by the Nazis and was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp where spent two years, suffering from tuberculosis, before escaping from there with help from the communists. When the war ended, he pursued a career in banking by joining Andre Istel and Company, a private investment banking firm owned by a friend of his father, and this gave him an opportunity to visit United States in 1946 for opening an office of his bank in New York. There, he met Marcel Schlumberger, one of the founders of the Schlumberger group, and on his invitation, Riboud joined Schlumberger as the founder's assistant in 1951. He continued in the company even after the death of Marcel Schlumberger in 1953 and rose in ranks to become the head of Europe operations and later, as the chief executive of the company in 1965. Seven years later, he became the chairman of the group, in 1972. Under his leadership, Schlumberger grew to become the largest oilfield services company in the world with interests in other sectors such as semiconductors. He expanded the company business by acquisitions, too; the taking over of Fairchild Camera and Instrument was one such acquisition. By the time he relinquished his position to his successor, Michel Vaillaud, in 1985, the company had a net profit of I.2 billion on a revenue of 6.4 billion and had presence in over 100 countries, controlling the operations of 70 percent of the world's oil wells. At that time, the company employed 80,000 people, held 10.9 billion in assets and was considered by many as the best managed company in the world. Riboud married Krishna Roy, historian, art collector, the great grand niece of Rabindranath Tagore and niece of Soumendranath Tagore, and the great grand daughter of Dwijendranath Tagore, in 1949, and the couple had a son, Christophe. It is reported that the Riboud couple had an extensive friendship circle which included political figures like François Mitterrand, Indira Gandhi and Ne Win and art personalities such as Yves Tanguy, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Isamu Noguchi, M. F. Hussain, Joan Miro and Max Ernst. They also had an art collection, some of which were later donated by Krishna Riboud to Musee Guimet where a separate gallery of Jean and Krishna Riboud collection is being maintained. Towards the later days of his life, he was afflicted with cancer and handed over his responsibilities to Vaillaud in September 1985. A month later, he died at his Neuilly-sur-Seine home, on 20 October 1985, survived by his wife, son and three grand children. The Government of India honored him with the civilian award of the Padma Bhushan in 1986. The story of his life has been documented in a book.

History The Daily Wire was conceived by Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing, who both worked for TruthRevolt, a news website that was formerly funded by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. After the duo secured several million dollars in seed funding from Dan and Farris Wilks, The Daily Wire was launched in 2015. The website's headquarters are in Los Angeles, California. In September 2020, Shapiro announced that The Daily Wire headquarters would be moved to Nashville, Tennessee. The Daily Wire became one of the leading news sites and publishers on Facebook in terms of engagement. In 2018, NewsWhip identified The Daily Wire as \\"by far\\" the top right-wing publisher on Facebook. According to NewsWhip, The Daily Wire was the sixth-leading English- language publisher on Facebook in 2019 through the month of March. The site also had the second most articles among Facebook's 10,000 top stories. In March 2019, Podtrac ranked The Daily Wire's The Ben Shapiro Show the second most popular podcast in the U.S., behind The Daily. In June 2020, Shapiro stepped down from his role as editor-in-chief, which he had held since the site's founding, and took on the role of editor emeritus. John Bickley was announced as the site's next editor-in-chief. Podcasts and radio In addition to its written content, the site produces the following podcasts: The Ben Shapiro Show, The Michael Knowles Show, The Matt Walsh Show, and The Andrew Klavan Show. The reach of The Ben Shapiro Show expanded in April 2018 when Westwood One began syndicating the podcast to radio. In January 2019, Westwood One expanded Shapiro's one-hour podcast-to-radio program, adding a nationally syndicated two-hour live radio show, for three hours of Ben Shapiro programming daily. , according to Westwood One, The Ben Shapiro Show is being carried by more than 200 stations, including in nine of the top ten markets. Controversies According to Snopes, \\"DailyWire.com has a tendency to share stories that are taken out of context or not verified\\", including reports on protesters digging up Confederate graves, Democratic congresspeople refusing to stand for a fallen Navy SEAL's widow, and Harvard University holding segregated commencement ceremonies. According to FactCheck.org, The Daily Wire incorrectly credited Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson with finding over $500 billion in accounting errors made by the Obama administration. FactCheck.org reported that the errors were discovered and published by HUD's independent inspector general before Carson became secretary. The Daily Wire has published articles expressing skepticism that climate change is occurring and that humans contribute to climate change. Climate scientists have described the articles as being inaccurate and misleading. The investigative website Popular Information accused The Daily Wire in October 2019 of violating Facebook's policies by creating 14 anonymous pages promoting its content exclusively to boost engagement. A new Facebook policy might force them to add their ownership to their pages. Facebook told Popular Information that it would take no action against The Daily Wire.

This was in retaliation for the Native Indian attacks made against the European American settlements of the Watauga Association in July 1776, in an early action of the American War of Independence. The expedition, which took place on the American frontier and resulted in the destruction of six Cherokee towns, ran from October 17 until November 16, 1776., unavailable The adventure only concluded when the troop was forced to turn back due to a lack of supplies. It was led by Captain William Moore of the 2nd Rowan County Regiment, acting directly under the command of Brigadier General Griffith Rutherford. Background Shortly after the outbreak of the Revolutionary War (April 1775), the members of the Watauga Association organized themselves into the extra-legal \\"Washington District\\", a region... \\"loyal to the united colonies...\\"John Finger, Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition; Bloomington, Ind; Indiana University Press; 2001; pp. 66-71; accessed May 2016 They promptly formed a Committee of Safety to oversee it. In the Spring of 1776, the Washington District Committee of Safety drafted a petition asking the Colony of Virginia to annex the district. After Virginia's refusal, a similar petition was drafted (July 5, 1776) asking the North Carolina Assembly to annex the area.\\"Petition of the Inhabitants of Washington District, Including the River Wataugh, Nonachuckie, and Co.\\"; 1776; received August 22, 1776; North Carolina State Archives; Raleigh, NC Shortly thereafter, the Cherokee initiated a plan to drive the settlers out of the area as a prelude to a planned invasion of Virginia. The first prong of the attack, led by Cherokee war chief, Dragging Canoe, was defeated by colonials at Heaton's Station. The second prong, led by Abraham of Chilhowee, was routed at Fort Watauga.Burns, History of Blount County, Tennessee, 11–12. In response to these attacks, several thousand Virginia militia (under General William Christian) attacked the Overhill towns, in what is today northeast Tennessee. The plan of attack was drawn in conjunction with a strategy which called for two thousand South Carolina militiamen (led by Major Andrew Williamson), as well as a small contingent from Georgia, to join up with the combined infantry and cavalry force from North Carolina (under General Rutherford). This united, southern army invaded the middle and lower Cherokee towns, and burned over 30 settlements, including the major towns of Tuskegee and Citico. The southern and northern forces, however, were unable to link up, due to a lack of supplies, and each group had returned home by mid to late September, 1776. At the end of the late summer engagements, Rutherford's force consisted of 1971 \\"privates of foot\\" (down from an initial 2500), and about 80 \\"light horse\\" cavalry under Captain Moore.Letter from Griffith Rutherford to Samuel Ashe; September 1, 1776; \\"Colonial and State Records of North Carolina;\\" University Library, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; accessed January 2016 The Light Horse raid Rutherford's cavalry commander, Moore, re- activated his cavalry troop on October 19, 1776.Cherokee Expeditions; Carolana.com; retrieved May 2016 On the 29th, he met up (near Cathey's fort) with Captain Joseph Hardin, who had been active since August in raising a cavalry troop from Tryon County, then part of the Salisbury Military District in North Carolina.Report from the Rutherford Expedition – Letter from Captain William Moore to General Griffith Rutherford, November 16, 1776; Chapter 4: The Rutherford Expedition; Learn NC Digital Archive; accessed January 2016 The next day the combined forces crossed into an area situated between the Swannanoa and French Broad Rivers, where they discovered fresh evidence of recent Indian activity. The cavalry quickly headed to the Cherokee town of Too Cowee, but having just a small army of 97 men at that point, found they could not surround the large, spread-out settlement, and opted for a direct raid instead. Charging into town, they found it almost entirely empty. They looted what food they could find, and torched the town. The chase of the main body of the fleeing Cherokee, however, then continued at a brisk pace, which at one point forced the fleeing natives to set fire to the forest to impede the progress of the pursuing cavalry. This conflict became known as the \\"Battle of Cowee Gap.\\" Results The expeditionary force destroyed an additional five Cherokee towns before being forced to retreat due to a lack of supplies. The majority of the Cherokee towns made peace shortly thereafter under the Treaty of Dewitt's Corner (1777). Dragging Canoe and Ostenaco refused to sign another treaty, and fled south with their followers, the Chickamauga Cherokee, to the creek which bears their name, in order to continue the armed struggle in what became known as the Cherokee–American wars, a decades long struggle which lasted until 1794.

This is included in the 1885 Salon entry recording that Jazet exhibited a painting titled Trop Novice. Alternatively, this entry also suggests that the rather fine looking studio could have been provided at 9 Rue Chaptal by Boussod, Valedon & Cie the successors to Goupil & Cie.It is interesting to note that the dog seen in the 1879 painting Le Billet de Logement was a prop kept in the studio. The highest recent auction price for one of Jazet's oil paintings was for The Death of Lord Nelson, measuring 41¾ x 61¾ in. (106 x 156.8 cm.) and dated 1882. It achieved $137,000 (hammer plus buyers' premium) at Christie's New York on 27 October, 2014. Paul-Léon Jazet also illustrated books. One was about the famous French military training school titled Histoire de l'École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr par un ancien saint-cyrien (History of the military academy of Saint-Cyr by an old saint-cyrien). This was first published in 1886 and contained 52 full-page black and white prints by Jazet.Paperback versions are still produced today.Similarly, in 1889, Jazet provided 40 illustrations for a book on French naval training history. An example of a non-military book for which he provided illustrations is the 1891 edition of La Confession D'Un Enfant Du Siècle (The Confession of a Child of the Century) by Alfred de Musset. This contained 10 drawings by Jazet. It is suggested that later in his career Jazet broadened his interests, and that the art work attributed to his father Alexandre-Jean-Louis Jazet , produced during the late Belle Époque and the Art Nouveau periods and signed by the pseudonym 'Japhet', was in fact produced by Paul-Léon Jazet. Such work included fans, postcards, posters and costume design for comic opera and theatre. This included costume designs for the famous dancer and actress Loïe Fuller whose swirling silk costumes and theme dresses, such as a dress strongly inspired by a butterfly, exemplified the new approach expressing organic forms characteristic of the Art Nouveau period.

He was appointed in May 2013 and resigned in 2018. Early life and education Goldring was educated at Churcher's College.Churcher's College, Petersfield School List 1973/4 p9 He has a bachelor's degree in law from Keble College, Oxford,‘GOLDRING, Mark Ian’, Who's Who 2017, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2017; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2016 ; online edn, Nov 2016 accessed 15 April 2017 and a master's degree in Social Policy and Planning in Developing Countries from the London School of Economics. Career After leaving University, with little idea of what he wanted to do next, Goldring volunteered with VSO. Goldring volunteered as a teacher in a small town in Borneo for two years. After leaving VSO, Goldring worked as a legal researcher for BP for nine months, before rejoining VSO, this time as an employee, first in Barbados and then Bhutan, where he set up its operation, and lived for three years. On returning to London, Goldring completed an MA in Social Policy and Planning in Developing Countries from the London School of Economics. Goldring then joined the United Nations Development Programme, serving as Assistant Resident Representative in its field office in Bangladesh where he oversaw projects in the social sectors. Goldring later described how he 'hated' the experience, and noted that 'The combination of UN bureaucracy and the Bangladesh infrastructure brought out the worst in everything'. As a result, Goldring took a job as Oxfam's country director in Bangladesh, while his wife, Rachel, worked for UNICEF. Goldring later moved to Fiji and ran the British government's South Pacific development programme. Following his time in Fiji, Goldring was appointed chief executive of VSO, a role that he held from 1999 to 2008. During his time as chief executive, Goldring introduced a number of new initiatives, most notably Business Partnerships, whereby large multinationals, such as Shell and Andersen Consulting, agreed to second staff to VSO as volunteers. In 2008 he began work as chief executive of Mencap, where he remained for five years. In May 2013, Goldring was appointed chief executive of Oxfam. While working in this role Goldring took part in the TV documentary Undercover Boss – a long-running series in which chief executives work incognito with the rank and file for two weeks. While taking part in the programme, Goldring spoke with a member of the public who complained about 'people at the tops of these charities who give themselves huge payouts'. Goldring was wearing a wig at the time and was unable to address the issue directly without blowing his cover. During a later interview with Third Sector magazine, Goldring agreed that pay is 'a very significant public issue', but argued that 'You've got to have a hierarchy of salaries, and if you've got as many people with very highly developed skills, as Oxfam has, you've got to pay lots of people quite a reasonable salary. So you pay your chief executive slightly more, on that scale'. Goldring was appointed a CBE in 2008 for services to tackling poverty and disadvantage. = Allegations of sexual misconduct by Oxfam staff = In February 2018, an investigation by The Times newspaper found that in 2011, prior to Goldring being appointed chief executive, Oxfam allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning the behaviour of staff in Haiti, in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. A confidential report produced by Oxfam concluded that children may have been among those sexually exploited by aid workers. In response to the story, Goldring and his colleague Caroline Thomson, Oxfam Chair of Trustees, meet with the Secretary of State for International Development, Penny Mordaunt. During the meeting, Goldring and Thomson made a full and unqualified apology for the way that Oxfam had responded to the behaviour of some of their staff in Haiti. Following the meeting, Goldring published an open letter of apology regarding misconduct in Haiti and Chad, in which he said: 'I know that this apology is by no means enough but I want to offer it unreservedly ... I am so sorry.'  Guardian Interview  During a follow up interview with the Guardian, Mark Goldring repeated his apology for the way that Oxfam responded to the behaviour of some of their staff and acknowledged that major reforms were needed. Goldring claimed, however, that the attacks which had been made against Oxfam, in light of the Times's report, were 'out of proportion to the level of culpability' and were motivated by an anti-aid agenda. Goldring explained that prior to the story published by the Times, he had never even heard of the nine men involved in the original scandal. Goldring explained that when he joined Oxfam as Chief Executive he was informed that there had been incidents in Haiti in 2011, and understood that Oxfam had subsequently made changes. During the interview Goldring accepted that Oxfam's decision not to tell the public why staff in Haiti were dismissed 'was wrong', but he added that it this decision was not motivated by a desire to protect men, 'I believe it was done in good faith to try to balance being transparent and protecting Oxfam's work ... I don't think [Oxfam] wanted to promote a sensation and damage the delivery of that programme. With hindsight, we should have said more. I’ve been clear about that right since this broke'. During the interview Goldring remarked that 'The intensity and ferocity of the attack makes you wonder, what did we do? We murdered babies in their cots?'. The following week, while being questioned by MPs on the International Development Committee, Goldring apologised for these remarks and explain: 'I was thinking under stress, I'd given many interviews, I'd made many decisions to try and lead Oxfam 's response to this, I was thinking about the amazing work that I had seen Oxfam do across the world, most recently for refugees ... coming from Myanmar , I should not have said those things, it is not for Oxfam to judge issues of proportionality, or motivation'. Goldring went on to repeat a broader apology, and a personal apology, for the damage that Oxfam had caused 'both to the people of Haiti but also to wider efforts for aid and development by possibly undermining public support'.  Reaction from former colleague  Following Goldring's meeting with the Secretary of State for International Development, Penny Mordaunt, Helen Evans, Oxfam's global head of safeguarding from 2012 to 2015, alleged that Goldring and his leadership team cancelled a meeting to discuss concerns that she had about widespread abuse involving Oxfam workers. In response to Evans's comments, Goldring argued that she should not have gone public with her concerns and added: I think [her criticism] was very unbalanced, and ironically didn't give enough credit to the very work that she promoted. I don't think she gives either herself or Oxfam enough credit for what was actually steady improvement'.  Personal life  Goldring is married to Rachel Carnegie. The couple have two adult children. Goldring's elder daughter was born in Bangladesh. Goldring's son was born in Fiji.

It is one of the most famous centuries old temple in South India. This temple is very special in its deities. One of the speciality is that it has two Lord Shiva deities one is the main Shiva and the other is Mahanadan. It is also well known for the biggest Cult image of 'Dharma Sastha' who is Lord Ayyappan. Lord Hanuman temple is located at the centre of temple pond.Non-Hindus are allowed in the temple. The temple (puja) routines are strictly followed. History Kilimarathukavu temple compound before renovation Kilimarathukavu Temple is one of the ancient temples in southern Kerala which is thousands of years old one. It was believed that the old temple was destroyed in the past and only the idols was left behind. And in the 21st century the people surrounded by the temple thought of renovating it to give the temple a new face. As a result, the new temple construction was completed and the daily poojas restarted. Travancore devasom board has taken the control of the renovated temple with the help of temple advisory committee in the year 2011. Temple legend During the Pandava's expulsion in forest, Arjuna traveled to ascetic for Lord Shiva to seek Pashupatastra. One day during the journey, he slept on a rock to take rest. As he woke up and continue his journey , a bird flew around him and chripped. Feeling boggle at the chirp of the bird, he meditated. He woke up in the existence of the bird and followed its path. The bird flies every day and one day, it reached a valley. The bird finally sat on a tree as high as the sky near to a clean stream and this drew Arjuna's attention towards it. Arjuna reached the place where the bird chirped. It was a big tree called \\"Kilimaram\\" the bird was sitting and chirping. The bird gazed at the face of Arjuna sitting on the branch of the tree. Arjuna had a feeling that bird said, this is the place where you can have your ascension. Bird suddenly plucked 3 leaves from the nearby \\"Koovalam\\" tree and put it there. Parthan felt like he was asked to do ascension for Lord Shiva. Arjuna commenced his ascension as said by the bird. Thus the place came to know as \\"Kilimarathil Kavu\\" and later to \\"Kilimarathukavu\\".Arjuna took bath in pond nearby and worshiped the Shiva Lingam stone found there. As time went on, Arjuna's ascension became severe. As requested by Lord Parvati, Lord Shiva came to Arjuna as a wild man and Parvathi as a wild woman. This time a monster sent by Duryodhana came to kill Arjuna. Monster in the figure of pig was attacked with arrow by Arjuna and Lord Shiva in wild man outlook. Arjuna and Lord Shiva started argument on hitting the pig. Arjuna beat the wild man with \\"Gandeevaam\\" (bow of Arjuna). Parvati, wife of Lord Shiva stopped it and explained who actually the wild man is. Hearing this Arjuna did sashtanka namaskar and Lord Shiva gifted him Pashupatastra and gave blessings. All goddess including Ganapathy, Murugan, Sastha, Anjaneyan requested to meet the look of wild man who is Lord Shiva. Finally everyone came to see the wild man and Lord Shiva told \\" Aujuna, the place where we are now is very sacred and whoever came here for prayer should be blessed.\\" Lord Shiva disappeared after saying this and a Shivalingam appeared itself on the same place. Even today two Shivalingam are worshiped. Lord Shiva It is rare that one temple is having two Shiva deities. In the main sreekovil one Lord Shiva deity and Sree Parvathy deity is there. It is said that the Shiva here is \\"Ardhanarishvaran\\". And another deity of Lord Shiva here is \\"Mahanadan\\". Sivarathri is the main festival for Lord Shiva.

India is a country in which everyone treat their country as their Motherland and every mother represents the motherland. Sree Sankaracharya Adi Shankara said nobody in this universe can explain the pain each mother experienced while giving birth to her child. Each and every mother carrying her child in her womb would take lots of pain and struggles. From the day after giving birth to her child every mother will take care of her child by countless efforts which is beyond any returns. Sankaracharya sacrificed everything in his life in order to lead a monastic life. Whatever spiritual heights he reached, in front of his mother he used to be her obedient child. That was the significance he had given to his mother. God could not be everywhere and therefore he created Mothers. This was Sankaracharya's version about mothers. Every mother has love and affection towards her child. Mother's blessings are beyond everything in this world. Nowadays, we conveniently forget in giving sufficient care for our parents. Mothers cared their children selflessly but in return, children shut down the door and dump them in old age homes. Our culture where parents were considered the final authority in families are being left in old age homes. In order to create the feeling the one's own mother should be revered and looked upon as God. There should be some kind of Mother Child relationship. To induce this, on Mother’s Day the children should take pooja along with their mother and worship them sitting at their feet. It is a healthy custom across all caste and religion in our society that God is worshiped through many forms and names. Among different ways of worship the first place is given to one's own mother, then father, then teacher and then a guest who comes home. Thus we teach \\"Mathru devo bhava, Pithru devo bhava, Acharaya devo bhava and Athithi devo bhava\\". In order to sow the seeds of parental respect towards every child's mother, \\"Mathru pooja\\" is a way to induce love and respect to their mother. Mathru pooja is based on the concept of paying our respects to our mother whom our culture sees as a representation of Devi. \\"Yaa Devi sarvabhootheshu Mathru roopena samsthitha Namasthasyai, Namasthasyai, Namasthasyai Namo Namah.\\" Mother's Day is a celebration honoring the mother of the family, as well as motherhood, mother - child relationship and the impact of mother in society. It is being celebrated on various days around the world commonly in the month of March and May. As per United Nations Organization and many other countries it is celebrated on second sunday in the month of May every year. On Mother’s Day United Nations celebrate moms who impact their lives and work tirelessly to change the world. The United Nations Foundation knows how important mothers are in promoting prosperity, success and growth in communities around the world. They support United Nations every day in its effort to provide mothers the resources they need to lead healthy and happy life. With all Nations temple is also celebrating Mother's Day on every 2nd sunday of May every year at Kilimarathukavu Temple. On this auspicious occasion the temple advisory committee and Satya sai seva organization put hands together for \\"Mathru Pooja\\" on the same day with hundreds of Mothers and children.The program is scheduled for one hour in which Mothers will be seated on chair and children on the floor. Children will do pooja to their Mother who is a representation of Devi, with milk, rose water and water by chanting mantras. And before the Pooja gets over Mothers will keep hands on child's head and bless them. At last Mothers will give sweet to their child and the Pooja gets over. As this being held on a sacred temple, every child will keep the ethics and in turn make mother child relationship ends forever. Hope in Kaliyuga, Mathrupooja is an eyeopener! Aushadha kanji = Aushadha Kanji during Karkidakam (Ramayanam) month = Aushadha kanji is one of the rarest ritual happening in Kilimarathukavu temple in the month of Karkidakam. In this whole month rice soup will be prepared at the temple with many ayurvedic ingredients prescribed by the temple Thandhri and pooja will be done. After the pooja the rice soup will be distributed to the devotees.

Retrieved 10 May 2016 (French) It is located in the state of Campeche in southern Mexico, in the extreme south of the Yucatán Peninsula. The location was determined by overlaying Maya constellations with a map of the Yucatán Peninsula. The alleged site has caused controversy as Mayanist scholars have cast doubt upon the potential discovery.  Remote prediction  The hypothetical discovery is based on analysis by the Canadian Space Agency of satellite data from NASA, and from the Japanese Space Agency, JAXA. The position of the site was posited by William Gadoury based on his theory that Maya site locations correlated with their astronomical data matching 117 known Maya sites with the positions of stars in 22 supposed \\"Maya constellations\\". Kʼàakʼ Chiʼ lies at a location suggested by a supposed 23rd constellation (containing three stars) with only two known sites corresponding on the ground. However, the density of Maya cities in the region is such that the supposed alignment of Maya sites with the constellations has been attributed to coincidence.Zhang, Sarah That long-lost Mayan city a teen found isn't lost...Or a city Wired magazine online. 10 May 2016. Gadoury reported that his study was sparked by reading the Mayan doomsday prophesies in 2012: Archeological exploration Archaeologist Richard Hansen noted that the location is also very close to the Maya ruins of Uxul, which have been the subject of archaeological investigation since 2009. Mexican archaeologist Rafael Cobos Palma pointed out that the area of the supposed discovery has been extensively explored by archaeologists since the 1930s, and was very close to various already-identified Maya sites in southern Campeche.Cruz, Mónica; and Abril Mulato, Las dudas de los expertos ante la ciudad maya 'descubierta' por un quinceañero canadiense El País: Verne 10 May 2016. Retrieved 19 May 2016. Doubts cast on the find The Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) (National Institute of Anthropology and History) in Mexico said it was not even “considering” the alleged find, since “there is no scientific basis for it”. Mayanist David Stuart cast doubt upon the discovery, describing it as an example of \\"junk science\\", and identified the object on satellite imagery as an old cornfield, or milpa.Canadian teen William Gadoury's discovery of 'Mayan city' debunked as junk scienceSydney Morning Herald 11 May 2016.

In a response to the alleged discovery, anthropologist and astronomer Anthony Aveni stated that trying to correlate a direct correspondence between a star map and a large quantity of man-made features is \\"an act of creative imagination.\\"Romey, Kristin Experts: Teen's 'Discovery' of Maya City is a Very Western Mistake: Why modern astronomical maps may not lead us to ancient sites., National Geographic online, 11 May 2016 Aveni has pointed out that there are several competing theories as to what the 13 Maya zodiacal constellations represent, and how they are arranged. Mayanist Francisco Estrada-Belli has pointed out that even if a Maya site were to be located in the predicted place, it could be down to coincidence since there are likely to be hundreds of undiscovered Maya archaeological sites; he commented that the chances were very good of putting a finger anywhere on a map of the region and pinpointing a Maya site. He also offered an invitation for Gadoury to come to Mexico with him to look for Mayan sites. Armand LaRocque of the remote sensing laboratory of the University of New Brunswick is reported as saying while satellite imagery might indicate a pyramid and building, anomalies identified in the satellite imagery needed further study and were not definitely man-made. Mayanist Nikolai Grube of the University Bonn, Germany who had worked in the area of concern for several years pointed out in an interview with the Spiegel-Magazin that the sites taken into consideration in Gadoury´s theory had been built several decades apart, which made the theory of a common planning of those sites improbable.

Background Out of the Heliopolis mare Camargo, Thinking Cap was sired by Rosemont who in turn was sired by the 1937 Leading sire in North America, The Porter. Bred and raced by the Christiana Stables of Harry Lunger and his wife Jane du Pont Lunger, Thinking Cap was trained by U. S. Hall of Fame inductee Henry S. Clark. Racing Career In his first year of racing at age two, Douglas Dodson rode Thinking Cap to his most important win in the 1954 Pimlico Futurity. Run over a muddy track, it would prove to be a surface he would do exceptionally well on throughout his career. Ridden by jockey Paul Bailey, Thinking Cap won two of the top stakes for 3-year-olds over muddy tracks, taking the Travers Stakes in August and the Lawrence Realization Stakes in October. Racing at age four and five, Thinking Cap continued to show his strength as a distance runner. Again with Paul Bailey aboard, in 1956 he won the mile and one-half Stymie Handicap at Belmont Park and the grueling mile and three-quarters Merchants and Citizens Handicap. In his last year of racing, Thinking Cap won the 1957 Southampton Handicap at Belmont Park. Ridden by Eldon Nelson, the race was contested on a sloppy track over a distance of a mile and one-half. At stud Retired to stand at stud for the Lungers, Thinking Cap sired a number of horses that made it into racing from which only his son Smart was able to achieve his sire's level of success. Smart, a 1959 chestnut colt whose dam was Enchanted Eve, inherited Thinking Cap's endurance with wins in such top level races at a mile and one-quarter or more such as the Manhattan, Gallant Fox, and Massachusetts Handicaps, the latter he won back-to-back in 1964 and 1965.

The first such device to reach production was designed by Diwakar Vaish, Head of Robotics and Research at A-SET Training & Research Institutes. The wheelchair is of great importance to patients suffering from locked-in syndrome (LIS), in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except the eyes. Such wheelchairs can also be used in case of muscular dystrophy, a disease that weakens the musculoskeletal system and hampers locomotion (walking or moving). History The technology behind brain or mind control goes back to at least 2002, when researchers implanted electrodes into the brains of macaque monkeys, which enabled them to control a cursor on a computer screen. Similar techniques were able to control robotic arms and simple joysticks. In 2009, researchers at the University of South Florida developed a wheelchair-mounted robotic arm that captured the user’s brain waves and converted them into robotic movements. The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), which captures P-300 brain wave responses and converts them to actions, was developed by USF psychology professor Emanuel Donchin and colleagues.The P-300 brain signal serves a virtual “finger” for patients who cannot move, such as those with locked-in syndrome or those with Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS). Diwakar Vaish, the inventor of the wheelchair during press ceremony  Technology  = Operation = A mind-controlled wheelchair functions using a brain–computer interface: an electroencephalogram (EEG) worn on the user's forehead detects neural impulses that reach the scalp allowing the micro- controller on board to detect the user's thought process, interpret it, and control the wheelchair's movement. = Functionality = The A-SET wheelchair comes standard with many different types of sensors, like temperature sensors, sound sensors and an array of distance sensors which detect any unevenness in the surface. The chair automatically avoids stairs and steep inclines. It also has a \\"safety switch\\": in case of danger, the user can close his eyes quickly to trigger an emergency stop.

It intends to delegate exclusively to Congress the duty of demarcation of indigenous and Quilombola territories, as well as the ratification of land already approved. It would prohibit the expansion of already existing indigenous areas. One of the proposal sections provides compensation of the Union to farmers who have properties absorbed by areas demarcated as indigenous land. The Federal Constitution considers that indigenous lands belong to the Union and, therefore, there is no compensation to those who lose the ownership of the territory when the demarcation is recognized. Currently, the government and Funai are responsible for demarcation. In the future, indigenous people might only be able to claim an area, they have lived in and used by 1988. It would give Congress the final say on new demarcations, a fact that displeases the indigenous leaders because of the strength of lobbyists. Much of the protected area of indigenous territories are rain forests being important for water and climate. There are farmers, who have filed an appeal. PEC 215 has been approved by a parliamentary committee. The proposal is being processed for 15 years in parliament. Members of the Chamber of Deputies of PT, PCdoB, PV, PSOL and REDE were against the bill. Approval of the bill depends on two rounds of voting in the plenary sessions of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate, with qualified quorum, that is, with the votes of at least 308 deputies and 49 senators. Parliamentarians opposed to the bill have said they will question its constitutionality in the Supreme Court. The bill needs three fifths of the votes in senate to be approved.

Directed and produced by Daniel Gordon, the two-hour film chronicles the disaster, the investigations, and their lingering effects; it also includes interviews with survivors, victims' relatives, police officers and investigators. It was co- produced by ESPN and BBC, first airing as a part of ESPN's series of sports films entitled 30 for 30, under the heading \\"Soccer Stories\\". Hillsborough aired in the United States on ESPN on 15 April 2014, the 25th anniversary of the disaster.Web page for 30 for 30: Hillsborough\\"When a game turned into a disaster,\\" from The New York Times, 14 April 2014 The documentary could not be shown in the United Kingdom when it originally aired in 2014, due to the High Court inquest of 2012 still being in progress. However, after the verdict of the inquest had been announced, the BBC aired the documentary on 8 May 2016, with additional footage from the inquest and final verdict. Events described in the film In 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel released its report and established an archive of media relating to the disaster. Much of the evidence reviewed by the panel had not been previously released to the public or to the media. Gordon's film draws on this newly available evidence to describe the events of 15 April 1989, as well as their causes and their consequences. =Before the disaster= * In 1981, at an FA Cup semi-final (Tottenham Hotspur v. Wolverhampton Wanderers) at Hillsborough, there was entry congestion at the Leppings Lane end, \\"things got crushy\\", and the fans were allowed in through Gate C; there was crushing including bruised ribs, but no deaths, and the congestion in the terraces was relieved by letting fans come through onto the edge of the pitch and sit on the perimeter track. Afterwards, someone said at a meeting that otherwise there might have been deaths, and got the reply \\"Bollocks!\\"; criminologist Phil Scraton, interviewed during the film, stated that this reply was a sign of deep-rooted institutional complacency. * In 1985, the pens were set up at Hillsborough. * Six months before the disaster, a young policeman was lured into a remote place in Ranmoor and attacked and left handcuffed by two men in balaclavas with pistols, but who proved to be two Yorkshire policemen. The enquiry into this severe hazing-type assault caused disciplinary measures in which four Yorkshire policemen were sacked, two were demoted and two transferred away, and Brian Mole - who had served since the early 1980s and was very experienced in football-related matters - was transferred to Barnsley, and as man in charge at Sheffield, he was replaced by David Duckenfield, who was much less experienced than his predecessor; at the briefing before the match, he spoke for a long time, but never mentioned crowd safety, and fumbled the name of Nottingham Forest club so badly that he appeared to know little about football. =The day of the disaster (15 April 1989)= * Ninety minutes before kickoff, few fans had arrived; the big crush came in the last 20 minutes or so before kickoff. In the pens behind the goal, the two central pens were very full; the outer two pens were much less crowded. The control box was above one end of the Leppings Lane end terraces, and could easily see all along those terraces. Outside, staff pulled some fans in through the turnstiles to try to relieve congestion. One policeman got so nervous at developments outside that he frantically radioed \\"For fuck's sake open these gates!\\" several times, despite police rules about language on radio. * About eight minutes before kickoff, Duckenfield ordered Gate C to be opened. At first, the crowd walked in orderly, but up to and around kickoff, this changed into a crush. Unlike in 1988, no order was given to close the entry tunnel's gate when the terrace pens were full. There was no order to delay kickoff. When the player Peter Beardsley kicked and the ball hit the goal's crossbar, this seemed to make the crush much harder. People tried to climb the barriers and were ordered not to. Six minutes after kickoff, the referee stopped the game. Gates in the pitchside barrier were opened, people were allowed on the pitch, and casualties were laid out there. Some spectators were helped to climb up into a spectator area above the terrace. A camera view afterwards showed that some of the metal-mesh barriers were bent and crumpled. Someone compared the crush in the two pens to fish caught in a trawl net. * Fans did not force the gate, which was opened by police order. However, in the control room, Duckenfield told Graham Kelly, an English football administrator, that Liverpool fans had charged, forcing entry to the central pens and thus causing the crush. A BBC commentator believed that statement and passed it on to camera. * Emergency services failed to activate Sheffield's major incident plan, so resources were not diverted to Hillsborough. A traffic jam of ambulances developed in Penistone Road outside the stadium; the event was at the opposite end of the pitch. Emergency equipment such as defibrillators were not brought onto the pitch. Basic airway management tools such as tubes and oxygen were in short supply. * Ten of the casualties were pronounced dead in hospital; all other fatal casualties were taken into Hillsborough Stadium's gymnasium. The emergency enquiry telephone number was jammed solid with callers, and one spectator's father seeking information had to drive to Sheffield over the Snake Pass, with the delays caused by the narrow twisting hilly road. Friends and family searching for loved ones were directed to a Boy's Club opposite Hammerton Road police station in Sheffield, and told to wait. From there they were carried in a double-decker bus to the Hillsborough stadium, and into a room, from which they were led one at a time into a room with Polaroid photographs of the faces of the dead on a wall. In that wall- display, the photographs were not sorted by skin colour or gender or race or age, characteristics which might otherwise have helped relatives to know which part of the display to look in; and the shiny surface of Polaroids hindered visibility of the image. If a relative identified a photograph, the body was brought out in a body bag on a trolley, and the relative was asked questions including many about alcohol drinking in a rather accusatory manner. Over 400 living casualties were treated in hospital. * The police who were involved in the disaster, were ordered to write their reports not in their personal notebooks, but on sheets of A4 paper which were provided. Those sheets were collected. On those sheets, much text was marked for deletion, either by strikethrough, or by drawing a rectangle around the text and then drawing that rectangle's diagonal lines; and words to be added were handwritten in. Those sheets were then transcribed in typewriting on other sheets of A4 paper, obeying the deletion and insertion instructions, and producing apparently clean reports which were shown as authoritative evidence to the first inquest. It was noticed later that all or most of the deleted text was criticising the police's equipment supply and handling of the event. * Dividing the terraces into separate pens stopped the fans from easing congestion by moving away sideways along the terraces, as they had done before. =After the disaster= * On 16 April 1989, Margaret Thatcher and Bernard Ingham and others arrived at Hillsborough. Although the official inquiry would state that fan behaviour was not the cause of the disaster, Ingham attributed the disaster to a \\"tanked-up mob of Liverpool supporters.\\" * Soon after that, newspapers published falsehoods about fan drunkenness and hooliganism including fans urinating on police. The stories were based on unsubstantiated claims made by, among others, a senior police official and a local MP who had not attended the match. * Investigators examined the turnstiles for their mechanical performance and determined how many people arrived and when. Despite claims that \\"thousands\\" of fans had rushed in, the Gate C surveillance camera showed about 1400 people entering (approximately the capacity of the four central terraces). * An attempt had been made after the disaster, to allege that the exit gate called Gate C had been forced open by rowdy fans trying to enter the ground before the match; it had in fact been opened on police order. * On order of the coroner Stefan Popper, the dead were blood-tested for alcohol. Those found positive, when identified, were checked through police records for criminal records. * The movie described a case of nervous breakdown in a policeman who had been at Hillsborough, precipitated some weeks afterwards by being stopped by the barrier coming down at an unmanned railway level crossing in Beighton in Sheffield. * August 1989: the preliminary version of the Taylor Report came out. * January 1990: the final version of the Taylor Report came out. It did not believe the stories about fan misbehaviour. But the coroner, acting independently of Taylor, reported \\"accidental death\\" for all the victims. * March 1993: life support for Tony Bland was switched off, and he became the 96th victim of the Hillsborough disaster; see Hillsborough disaster#Stuart-Smith scrutiny. * 1996: Phil Scraton, who spoke in the movie, saw a man on television talking about disaster, and recognized him as a policeman who had been at the Hillsborough disaster. After several months of attempts at contact, the two met in Hathersage, and again twice more. At the third meeting, the (now former) policeman brought in and showed a boxfile containing some of the policemen's typed reports, with the alterations described above, and called it \\"sanitising\\". * 1997: the Labour Party came into power and promised to revisit Hillsborough. * October 1998: Scraton went to the House of Lords's reading room in Parliament in London, and there was shown the police report papers, stacked untidily on a table in cardboard boxes. Inside the boxes, the police reports were in a thoroughly disordered and shuffled condition, some as photocopies. He sorted them into the three versions of each report (handwritten, original typed, edited), collated them, examined them, and reported what he found. * 2000: The Hillsborough Family Support Group private-prosecuted Duckenfield and Bernard Murray for dereliction of duty, etc., at Hillsborough.

He was a pioneer of Soviet avant-garde photography in the 1920s and 1930s, one of the first photojournalists in the USSR, and one of the most significant artists of the Soviet era.  Early life  Boris Ignatovich was born in 1899 in the Russian Empire in the city of Slutsk, in present-day Belarus. He studied at gymnasia in Lodz and Lugansk, until he was expelled in 1917 for the publication of a handwritten magazine and for participation in revolutionary activities. In 1918, he graduated from the Vyborg gymnasium in Petrograd (present-day St. Petersburg). After graduation, Ignatovich returned to Lugansk, where he began work as a journalist and joined the Communist Party. He worked as an editorial assistant at the Kharkiv newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda and the Kiev newspaper Vseizdat, then as a managing editor of the newspaper Krasnaya Bashkiria in Ufa, Bashkortostan. He was also in charge of the regional office of Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) in Sterlitamak. In 1918, he became one of the first members of the Russian Union of Soviet Journalists in 1918. In 1922, Ignatovich rose to become chief editor of the Moscow newspaper Gornyak. Accusations that he had published unverified reports from amateur proletarian journalists known as rabkor led to his demotion from membership in the Communist Party and dismissal from his job as editor. He relocated to Petrograd, where he headed the editorial boards of the magazines Drezina, Smekhach, and Buzotyor.  Early career  In 1923, Ignatovich made his first photo report: a snapshot of writer Mikhail Zoshchenko buying apples, taken with a pocket Kodak camera at the editorial office of Smekhach. In 1925, he was restored to the ranks of the Communist Party and returned to Moscow, where he continued to work as an editor and soon joined the prominent newspaper Bednota as a press photographer, covering rural life, the peasantry, and industrial developments. His photographs began appearing in the photography magazine Sovetskoe Foto, and by the end of the decade he was working as a photographer for numerous publications, including the magazines Sovremennaia arkhitektura, Radioslushatel'Radioslushatelʹ. (1928). Moskva: Izd-vo N.K.P. i T. and Illiustrirovannaia rabochaia gazeta. In 1927, he participated in the photography exhibition of the Society of Friends of Soviet Cinema (Obshestvo Druzey Sovetskogo Kino - ODSK, Moscow), through which he met Alexander Rodchenko. In 1929, he was included in the landmark modernist exhibition Film und Foto (FiFo) in Vienna and Stuttgart.  Cinematography and mid-career  In the 1930s, Ignatovich began to work in cinema, in particular in documentary films. In 1930, he shot the documentary film Today at the Soiuz-kinokhronika studio, with a screenplay by Esphir Shub; stills from this film were published in the magazine Kino i Zhizn' (Cinema and Life). He also participated in the creation of one of the first sound films, Olympiad of Art, and made an extensive series of aerial surveys of Leningrad from an R-5 reconnaissance plane for a special issue of USSR in Construction. In 1932–34, working as a filmmaker for Soiuzkinohronika, he shot the documentary films How the Kukryniksy Work and The Electrification of the USSR. Together with Alexander Rodchenko, he led the photography section of the October Group, a collective of Constructivist and avant-garde artists that existed in the USSR from 1928 to 1932. In 1932, he was elected chairman of the Moscow Association of Photojournalists. He headed the department of illustrations at the newspaper Vecherniaia Moskva (Evening Moscow), and contributed to newspapers including Pravda, Rabochaya gazeta, Trud, and Komsomolskaya pravda, as well as the magazines Projector, Krasnaya niva, Ogonyok, Smena Vekh,Российский ленинский коммунистический союз молодежи, Всесоюзный ленинский коммунистический союз молодёжи, & MK VLKSM. (1924). Smena. Moscow: Pravda. and Soviet Photo. His work in this period included documentation of the Stakhanovite movement and a series on the Cossacks. The late 1930s also saw the formation of the so-called \\"Ignatovich Brigade,\\" composed of devotees and young photographers who had studied under Ignatovich. The group included Elizar Langman, Olga Ignatovich and Elizaveta Ignatovich, and provided images for Evening Moscow and Soyuzfoto. In 1937-38, Ignatovich's work was exhibited in the First All-Union Exhibition of Photographic Art at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, the Russian Museum in Leningrad, and in Kiev. From 1937 to 1941, he worked as a staff photojournalist for the magazine Construction of Moscow, while continuing to cooperate with the magazine USSR in Construction. By the end of the decade, his work as being exhibited as far abroad as Lithuania and England.  World War II  Ignatovich served as a military photographer on the Eastern Front during World War II, working for the newspaper Boevoe Znamia. He rode on horseback, reporting on a range of topics – including sapper squads, cavalry, snipers, scouts, front-line barbers, and field kitchens – in a variety of forms, such as chronicles, vignettes, genre scenes, and group and personal portraits. In the last years of the war, he was sent by a studio of military photographers to the Western and Bryansk fronts, where he worked with partisan detachments. At the Potsdam Conference in 1945, he photographed Marshal Zhukov signing the Potsdam Declaration. He continued to work as a military photographer until 1950, when he was discharged with the rank of captain.  Postwar period and death  After his war service, Ignatovich made his first forays into color photography. In the 1950s he worked as a photographer for Ogonyok, as well as for the publishing houses Pravda, Izogiz, Stroiizdat, and Zhurnal mod, and led technical workshops at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV), where he set up a laboratory for color photography. He participated in the landmark exhibition in Moscow Photo Art of the USSR: 40 Years. He also headed a department at the publishing house Iskusstvo. In 1957, publication of the magazine Soviet Photo was resumed, and he worked briefly in the literary department. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he supervised a photo studio in the factory Serp i molot, consulted for the photo studio club Trudovye rezervy, and led the reporting section in the country's biggest photography club, Novator, taking part in club exhibitions. In 1969, in honor of his seventieth birthday, the Moscow branch of the Union of Soviet Journalists organized a solo exhibition of Ignatovich's work at the Central House of Journalists. The exhibition featured photographs from every period of Ignatovich’s career, from 1923 through 1963, and included large-scale prints, made by Ignatovich, whose size was highly unusual for exhibitions at that time. The last years of Ignatovich's life were spent in his communal apartment on Lenin Prospect, where young photographers would often visit to present their work and to learn from the old master. His wife and archivist, Klavdia Ignatovich, reports, \\"I served as an assistant, a photo model, and a cook for him. Boris Vsevolodovich was working until the very last.\\" Ignatovich died on 4 April 1976. He is buried in Rogozhskoe Cemetery in Moscow. Assessing his legacy after his death, the writer and historian of photography Valeriy Stigneev wrote, \\"He worked a frame like a sculptor, shearing off anything superfluous, and brought it to life like a movie. That's how he has entered his name in history. The epoch of Ignatovich saw photographs acquire a language of their own, an artistic expressiveness of their own. The revolution in Russia swept away the bourgeois order and the bourgeois aesthetic. The builders of a new society needed their own language and idols. On this great, fast-moving wave of art rose Mayakovsky, Rodchenko, Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov, Deineka, El Lissitsky, and others. More accurately, they made this art. Boris Ignatovich made photography.\\"  Selected filmography  *Today, 1930. Documentary film produced by the Soiuz- kinokhronika studio, Moscow. Screenplay by Esfir Shub. *Olympiad of Art, 1930.

He became a member of the Communist Party in 1928 and suffered from growing levels of harassment at work. When the Nazi Party took power in Germany at the beginning of 1933 his problems greatly intensified: he had already been dismissed from one teaching post, and participated in (now illegal) resistance to the government. During the war he was released from the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen and, in 1943, declared fit for military service and conscripted into the army. A reluctant soldier, he was sent off to guard prisoners of war. After he helped a Soviet officer to escape by returning the man's gun he found himself before a military court which conferred a double death sentence on him. He was executed in northern Norway. Life Klug was born into a Hamburg working-class family, the first of his parents' three recorded children. His father, Ernst Klug, had grown up far to the south in Vogtland where he had turned down the opportunity to train as a teacher, preferring an apprenticeship as a butcher because, as he put it, \\"a butcher can always get enough to eat\\". As a young man, while travelling, Ernst Klug met Emma Lucht in Hamburg. Her family came from nearby Albersdorf, and after a protracted courtship the couple married and set up their home in the Hamburg quarter of Eimsbüttel. The port facilities at Hamburg were booming during the early years of the twentieth century, and by the time Rudolf Klug was born in 1905 his father was working not as a butcher but as a dock worker. Ernst Klug was also active as a trades unionist. Before he was 9 the First World War had broken out and his father was called away to join the army. In 1916 his younger brother, Ernst-Otto was born, and with the household budget under pressure Rudolf took work as a part-time errand boy, although his mother had to be persuaded to lie about his age for this to be possible. Meanwhile, he moved on from primary to secondary school, hoping to study to become a teacher. His father believed that the option was unaffordable, but his mother took extra work and as he grew older Rudolf also took every opportunity to work during the vacations in order to fund the necessary courses. In 1923 he embarked on a period as a trainee teacher, while continuing to study for the necessary qualification. His pedagogic studies focused, especially, on psychoanalysis and individual psychology. He qualified in 1927 (which was also the year in which his father died following a work accident at the docks) and took a teaching post at the Secondary School in Hamburg's Telemann Street. The co-educational school was considered a progressive establishment with a moderately socialist ethos. His sister later recalled that he developed excellent relationships with the children he taught and was also popular with parents. With his younger sister, Kati, he started attending a youth club and his political awareness began to develop. While he was considering the need to broaden the access of working class children to education he became a co- founder of the so-called \\"Proletarische Volksheim-Jugend\\" organisation. In 1929 Rudolf and Kati joined the Young Communists and the Communist Party itself. They participated in day trips and evening political discussions organised by the party. Hamburg city politics during the later 1920s reflected national trends, with the Social Democrats and traditional conservative parties losing out to the Communists on the left and, even more starkly, to the Nazis at the other extreme. Rudolf Klug became involved with the \\"Interests Community of Opposition Teachers\\" (\\"Interessengemeinschaft Oppositioneller Lehrer\\" / IOL) which was created in 1931 in order to \\"oppose the dismantling of social rights and achievements in education and the growing risk of fascism\\". As a popular young teacher who was also a Communist Party activist Rudolf Klug generated mistrust at an increasingly jittery city hall, both among the Nazis and among the traditional conservatives. An investigation hearing was launched in May 1930 after he had been denounced for \\"creating squads of school children\\" to \\"fight against fascism in schools\\". The allegation concerned not the school where he worked but a nearby school in Rellinger Street (where he had never had any involvement). While the investigations triggered by the complaint were under way the party selected him as a candidate for the 1931 municipal elections and he was dismissed from the teaching service. Pupils and teachers at his own school in Telemann Street, supported by the governors, protested and the Social Democrat chairman of the governors Fritz Köhne succeeded in having him reinstated, but the supervisory school board nevertheless insisted that he be moved to another school, and asked the police to keep an eye on him. The Nazis took power nationally in January 1933 and lost little time in converting the German state into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal. Early on Klug spoke out in public against the rapid withdrawal of human rights. Under the provisions of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (\\"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\\") which had been in force since 7 April 1933 Klug was identified for permanent exclusion from the schools service on 17 June 1933. The law in question is generally cited as a device for removing Jews from public service, but there was also scope for applying it to other public servants, including teachers, who fell out of official favour for non race- based political reasons. Klug's name appeared in an advertisement in several Hamburg which listed a number of teachers \\"on leave from the schools service\\" (\\"\\"aus dem Schuldienst beurlaubt\\"\\"). Klug had already had his apartment searched by police in May 1933, and been arrested while at school, but he had on that occasion been released for lack of evidence. Towards the end of the summer he was arrested again, and on 4 October 1933 condemned to a year in prison for \\"preparing high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). He was imprisoned at Wolfenbüttel till 11 August 1934, after which he was involved in forced labour at a young persons' holiday camp on the Island of Sylt. By the end of 1934 he was back in Hamburg and had taken work with the little coffee trading business set up near the dockside by the former municipal politician Kurt Adams. Two things he had in common with Adams (and with his fellow employees) were that he needed to support himself financially and that he had been deprived of his chosen career for reasons of politics and / or race. Klug's own work involved making deliveries by bicycle. In order to avoid drawing the interest of the authorities, the left-wing IOL, of which he had been a member earlier in the decade, had by now dissolved itself into a number of small and for most purposes isolated cells, but his delivery work nevertheless enabled Klug to keep in touch with political friends and teachers whom he had known in the IOL, as well as parents whom he had known when he was a teacher at the school in Telemann Street. And although his deliveries were officially only of coffee, he also took the opportunities presented to distribute illegal written materials. Klug was probably subjected to a further arrest in 1935. In April 1937 he was one of around 100 political dissidents caught up in a Gestapo round-up. They were taken to the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen where Klug was held for three months. 1937 was also the year in which, after two years, his marriage to his wife Ilse broke up. On his release Klug returned to Hamburg, shortly afterwards resuming his illegal political activities and supporting himself with casual work. Later he found work as a credit control book keeper in Hamburg's Lurup quarter with an abrasives producer called Christiansen & Co. In 1938 he was interrogated at the city hall by the Gestapo who invited him to tell them about the illegal activities of teachers. Participating in a political discussion group that masqueraded as an \\"emigrants' group\\", Rudolf Klug got to know the book seller Margaretha Kubicki. They married during 1940 and moved into an address at Barmbeker Street 93. Their daughter Anja was born on 18 April 1942. In 1940 a communist resistance group coalesced in Hamburg around Bernhard Bästlein, Franz Jacob and Robert Abshagen. Rudolf Klug joined them. By the end of 1944 all four men would have been executed. In the world beyond Hamburg, the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 had triggered a wider war across Europe. Rudolf Klug's criminal record made him officially \\"unworthy for military service\\". According to his sister he was persuaded by comrades in the Bästlein-Jacob- Abshagen Group to apply to have his \\"fitness for military service\\" restored in order that he might join the army and create political opposition to the Nazis inside it. His wife always insisted that the application in question did not come from Klug at all. Either way, he was conscripted, not into the regular army but into a Landsturm (regional militia) . Here he was trusted to guard prisoners of war. Still guarding prisoners of war, Klug's final posting was to Narvik in the north of occupied Norway. Here he made contact with prisoners and with a group of Norwegian resistance movement activists. In the context of preparations for the escape of a group of inmates from the prison camp, Klug returned a Soviet officer's pistol that had been confiscated and was being kept in the office. The absence of the pistol was spotted and on 26 February 1944 Rudolf Klug was detained. He managed to escape from his captors, but was betrayed by members of his unit and re-arrested. On 15 March a military court gave him a double death sentence, finding him guilty of both treason during war and of desertion. On 28 March 1944 the sentence was carried out when Rudolf Klug was shot dead just outside Narvik, at Beisfjord. The military court notified the widow that Klug had been buried \\"on the spot.\\" The court ordered Margarete not to publish any death notice or obituary about her husband.

It is situated on Edgbaston Reservoir in the centre of Birmingham. The club was founded in 1894. It is an open sailing club for men, women, adults, and children of all abilities. The club actively tries to improve the diversity of the sailing population by engaging with the local community Midland Sailing Club is an RYA training centre, and courses for both beginners and more advanced sailors are run at regular intervals. Since 2019 this is done through SailBirmingham, an initiative to increase community engagement through watersports. Apart from regular junior training courses and OnBoard sessions, this also includes Stand up paddleboarding. Members of the club take part both in the regular club races on Saturday afternoons and Wednesday evenings (during the summer months), and also in Open meetings across the country. The club regularly sends teams to the Southport 24 Hour Race. Burgee The club burgee is the Swiss flag. This is a reference to the fact that the club was one of the earliest sailing clubs in England which is landlocked, so that it was jokingly compared to the Swiss navy. A letter from the Swiss embassy exists which allows the club to use the white cross on red background as its burgee. History Midland Sailing Club was founded on June 11th, 1894. Initially, boats hired from Salters of Oxford were used in racing, before the club in 1896 ordered seven boats from Mr Henry Holford of Gloucester. There were three branches at the beginning, Edgbaston (sailing on Edgbaston Reservoir), Norton (sailing on \\"Norton Pool\\"), and Barnt Green (sailing on Upper Bittell Reservoir). This was partly due to lack of effective transport to sail at a central location at the time. The Edgbaston branch was the only one with a record of uninterrupted racing seasons from its foundation until the outbreak of the First World War. During the war, racing was suspended, and the boats moored at the Norton branch were used as target practice by miners stationed there, who used to throw rocks into them until they sunk, effectively ending sailing there. As there was also no sailing at Barnt Green (until the foundation of Barnt Green Sailing Club in 1918), Midland Sailing Club decided at the AGM in February of 1919 to drop the \\"Edgbaston Branch\\" designation and continue as Midland Sailing Club from then onwards.

Some volcanic rocks have been affected by faulting; buried faults are also found. The San Luis-Tepehuanes fault system is associated with the field. The whole field is covered by lavas, which are about thick and reach a total volume of . Magma ascent has been controlled by northwest-trending faults. Volcanism in the wider territory was related to the subduction of the Farallon plate until 29 mya. Later tectonic changes caused a start of more alkaline volcanism. The volcanoes have erupted basanite. The main components of the rocks at La Breña-El Jagüey are clinopyroxene, ilmenite, olivine, plagioclase and titanomagnetite, with rocks sporting variable textures. The participation of water in the formation process of these magmas is debatable; the rocks may have been influenced by sediments from the uppermost part of the subducting Farallon slab. These rocks are of mafic intraplate geochemistry. The rocks contain mantle xenoliths. The most prominent volcanic centres of the field are the La Breña-El Jagüey maars. They form intersected craters and the larger Brena crater has cinder cones within. The diameter of the Brena maar is and Jagüey , rising above a high lava plain. Each maar is surrounded by a tuff ring high. Jaguey presently holds a permanent lake and the formation of both maars was probably influenced by groundwater.

Other cones in the field may date back to Pliocene-Pleistocene times given their state of degradation; one K-Ar date is 0.8 mya. These two maars may be the most recent eruption products of the field, likely of Holocene age given the unvegetated appearance of the lava flows. The field is an inhospitable terrain.

It was named after Ultan of Ardbraccan, patron saint of paediatricians. History The Hospital was founded by Kathleen Lynn and Madeleine ffrench-Mullen with the help of Sinn Féin activists in 1919. The committee opened the Hospital with a fund of just £70 and 2 sleeping cots. The building was in a state of disrepair and was reputed to have once been a shooting hall used by Lord Charlemont. It was the first hospital for infants in Ireland and hospital physicians in the early years included Ella Webb and Dorothy Price. Earlier in her career, Lynn had experienced discrimination in applying for hospital positions due to her gender, and Saint Ultan's was the only hospital in Ireland entirely managed by women.Ó hÓgartaigh, Margaret, Kathleen Lynn. Irishwoman, Patriot, Doctor. (Irish Academic Press, 2006). pp. 68–69. It was the first hospital in Ireland to provide the BCG vaccination and from 1937 became the centre for BCG in Ireland. Dr Barbara Stokes, specialist in children with disabilities, also worked at the hospital. After services transferred to the National Children's Hospital in Harcourt Street, Saint Ultan's Children's Hospital closed in 1984.

It is located along Stirling Terrace, overlooking Princess Royal Harbour adjacent to the White Star Hotel. The three storey building is an example of Victorian Free Classical architecture and is part of a group of commercial buildings with an asymmetrical façade and inter-columnisation. The building has a painted rendered brick facade on the second and third storeys with painted brick below. The roof is concealed by a parapet wall with gables and classical decorative motifs. Street level windows are arched and a cantilevered box verandah provides some shade and cover. The hotel was built in 1885, during the Western Australian goldrush of the 1890s and 1890s when thousands of prospectors arrived in Albany en route to the Kalgoorlie goldfields resulting in a building boom in Albany. The site on which the hotel is found was where Aberdeen House, constructed prior to 1867 and the home of Alexander and Catherine Moir, once stood. Some of the house was later incorporated into the rear of the hotel. The Moir's leased the building to Frederick Watts in the mid-1880s; he then converted it to a hotel. He named it the Railway Hotel after the Great Southern Railway station that had been built just below the site. By 1892 Moir leased the hotel to Charles Bailye, who changed the name to the Royal George Hotel. In 1897 the licensee was Edward Reynolds and the building had five sitting rooms and 22 bedrooms. The Cremorne Gardens were once located behind the hotel. The gardens included an outdoor cinema and a roller skating rink. The gardens have since been demolished. In 1910 work commenced on extensions to the hotel. The top storey was added along with a front balcony with cast iron lacework. The walls were made of tuck-pointed brickwork with stucco bands and sills. The first floor level had 18 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms and toilets and a sitting room. The second floor had 13 bedrooms with 2 baths and toilets. The bar facilities took up the ground floor. The balcony has since been removed and replaced with a cantilevered box verandah. Guests had to be evacuated when a fire broke out in one of the rooms in 2005, causing 35,000 worth of damage. In 2014 a heritage grant was awarded to the Royal George and other heritage buildings for work such as painting and repairs to facades, brickwork and windows as part of Anzac Centenary commemorations.

In the summer of 1787, William Beckford stayed with the Marquis of Marialva, master of the horse for the kingdom, at his residence of Seteais Palace. At the beginning of the 19th century Princess Carlota Joaquina, wife of the Regent John, bought the estate and Ramalhão Palace. Between 1791 and 1793, Gerard Devisme constructed a Neo-Gothic mansion on his extensive estate in the Quinta de Monserrate (later known as the Monserrate Palace). Beckford, who remained in Sintra, rented the property from Devisme in 1794. The landscape, covered in fog, also attracted another Englishman, Francis Cook, who occupied the estate, constructing an oriental pavilion. The Palace of Pena, Sintra's exemplary Portuguese Romantic symbol, was initiated by the King-Consort Ferdinand II of Portugal, husband of Queen Maria II of Portugal. =19th century= In 1854, the first contract was signed to construct a rail link between Sintra and Lisbon. A decree signed on 26 June 1855 regulated the contract between the government and Count Claranges Lucotte but was later rescinded in 1861. The connection was finally inaugurated on 2 April 1887. The Portuguese Riviera originated when King Luís I of Portugal ordered a royal residence to be constructed in Cascais Citadel, starting the tradition of Cascais being the Portuguese royal family's Summer residence, which lasted from 1870 to 1908, transforming the seaside village into a cosmopolitan address. Thanks to King Luís I, the citadel was equipped with the country's first electric lights in 1878. Cascais also benefited with the construction of better roads to Lisbon and Sintra, a casino, a bullfight ring, a sports club, and improvements to basic infrastructure for the population. Many noble families built impressive mansions still to be seen in the town centre and environs. The first railway arrived in 1889. An advertisement for Estoril and its amenities; first half of the 20th century. In 1896, King Carlos I of Portugal, a lover of all maritime activities, installed in Cascais Citadel the first oceanographic laboratory in Portugal. The King himself led a total of 12 scientific expeditions to the coast; these ended in 1908 with his assassination in Lisbon. From the second half of the 19th century into the first decades of the 20th century, Sintra also became a privileged place for artists: musicians such as José Vianna da Motta; composers such as Alfredo Keil, painters like João Cristino da Silva (author of one of the most celebrated canvases of Portuguese Romantic art, \\"Cinco Artistas em Sintra\\"), writers such as Eça de Queirós or Ramalho Ortigão, all these people lived, worked or got inspiration from Sintra's landscapes. By the beginning of the 20th century, Sintra was recognized as a summer resort visited by aristocrats and millionaires. Among these, Carvalho Monteiro, owner of a considerable fortune (known as \\"Monteiro dos Milhões\\") constructed near the main town on an estate he bought from the Baroness of Regaleira, the Quinta da Regaleira, regarded as a prime example of Neo-Manueline architecture. =World War II= During the Second World War, the region was the centre of spies and diplomatic secrecy, situations that provided the region with a cosmopolitan atmosphere and sophistication. Owing to the vision of Fausto Cardoso de Figueiredo and his business partner Augusto Carreira de Sousa, it became an international tourist destination both during and after the Second World War. In July 1940, Edward, Duke of Windsor (former Edward VIII of the United Kingdom) and his wife, Wallis Simpson, moved to Estoril, where they lived at first in the home of Ricardo de Espírito Santo, a Portuguese banker with both British and German contacts.Bloch, p. 91 During that time, several dignitaries and exiles came to Estoril: Miklós Horthy, the regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (lived and died in exile after the Second World War); the Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona (father of Juan Carlos I of Spain) and the King resided in the territory, as did Umberto II of Italy and Carol II of Romania. It was also in this location that former Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar had a summer house. It was Salazar who ordered the construction of the E.N.6 motorway, more commonly referred to as the Avenida Marginal, in order for him to quickly travel by car between Cascais and Lisbon (until then the accessway was nothing more than a dirt road, where traffic could only circulate at low velocities and make frequent stops). The roadway permitted the dictator to travel rapidly, and with fewer stops, it was not possible for him to be recognized easily in transit. Casino Estoril, with its gardens facing the Atlantic Ocean is Europe's largest casino. Complementing the jet-set community that prospered in the region, Casino Estoril, Europe's largest casino, was founded in 1958. =Today= Today the towns of the Portuguese Riviera continue to host the Portuguese elite and be a vacation destination for international tourists. The Riviera plays an important part in tourism in Portugal. A large expatriate community continues to exist, primarily in Cascais and Sintra, leading to the majority of Lisbon's international schools being located within the area (with Carlucci American International School and TASIS Portugal in Sintra, St Julian's School and St Dominic's School in Cascais, and Oeiras International School). Luxury gated communities have greatly developed in the region in the late 20th and early 21st century, including Quinta da Marinha (Cascais), Quinta Patino (Estoril), Quinta da Beloura and Quinta da Penha Longa (both in Linhó, Sintra). Since the middle of the 20th century, the region has come to play host to numerous international sports and entertainment festivals, such as the Lisbon & Estoril Film Festival (in Estoril), the 4 Hours of Estoril endurance race (in Cascais), and NOS Alive music festival (in Algés). The Cascais Marina has hosted many important events, including the America's Cup World Series. Geography =Climate= The region has a Mediterranean climate, influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and characterized by moderate temperatures and wet winters. The climate in the area of Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point of Europe, is primarily semi-arid. The Sintra Mountains are considered moderately humid, with precipitation in the mountains is higher than in the surrounding areas. The position of Sintra in the natural landscape of the Sintra Mountains is influenced by the existence of a micro-climate. Due to its micro-climate, the area has developed a dense foliage with a rich botanical diversity. The coast along Praia do Guincho, located within the bounds of the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, is known for its particularly strong winds and powerful waves, making it a popular destination for surfing and wind-surfing. =Parks= File:Sintra - Palacio da Pena (20334379279) (cropped).jpgParque da Pena File:WestCoast Portugal.jpgCabo da Roca File:Monserate 2180128 1 (244152369).jpegParque de Monserrate File:Sintra, Quinta da Regaleira 05.jpgJardim da Regaleira File:Portugal-1209457 960 720.jpgPraia da Ursa File:Sintra, Parque da Pena 04.jpgParque da Pena File:Lagoa no Parque Marechal Carmona, Cascais. 05-19.jpgParque Marechal Carmona File:Cabo Raso e Cabo da Roca (140814921) (cropped).jpgPraia do Guincho File:Parque Natural de Sintra-Cascais CM02.jpgSintra-Cascais Natural Park File:\\"Túmulo do Inglês\\" - Praia de Paço de Arcos - Portugal (1473460028).jpgPraia de Paço de Arcos File:Park and National Palace of Pena (34389543695).jpgJardim do Lago File:Pedra da Ursa - Portugal (6385702015).jpgPraia da Adraga =Places= The Portuguese Riviera is based along the Costa do Sol or Estoril Coast, along the Atlantic Ocean.

The Portuguese Riviera is famed as a bastion of culture in Portugal, as the home to numerous prestigious institutions, art galleries, museums, and a cultural agenda including various international music festivals, film festivals, concerts, international summit meetings, and cultural festivals, among others. The riviera is home to numerous Michelin star restaurants and known as a culinary destination for Portuguese cuisine and international cuisine alike.Portugal Confidential - 2019 Michelin Star Restaurants in Portugal Summer architecture, a Portuguese architectural movement of the 19th and early 20th century, originated in the Riviera, following the Portuguese Royal Family's arrival in the region in 1870.

On the way he encounters Kate Vanderdecken, Rigby's former sweetheart, who has travelled to Australia searching for him. Critical reception A reviewer in The Daily Standard (Brisbane) found the book slow going but worth it in the end: \\"The book has some quaint features, and its quaintness of language and style is rather discouraging at first but it grows on one, and presently the reader finds himself engrossed in picturesque chatter that is at times distinctly clever.

Main scientific contributions  From the concept of index or coefficient of adequacy given by Jaume Gil Aluja in 1996, many draws in adequacy can occur. To solve it, Pérez Capdevila introduced the concepts of overweight in adaptation, fuzzy coefficient for equal adequacy coefficients and adjusted tiebreaker coefficient for equal adequacy coefficients, which he defines with precision, to unpack in an indefinite number of cases with equal adequacy coefficients, thus rounding out a theory about the suitability of candidates for a preset profile Built the operation of mixture of fuzzy sets, where from elements of different nature new elements are obtained with their certain degrees of belonging. In the field of applied mathematics he has achieved important advances regarding the evaluation of the economical effects and control of the exotic invading alien species, and he has accomplished important theoretical contributions. He has contributed to the concepts of individual benefit of an exotic invading alien species, collective benefit of an exotic invading alien species, a priori cost-benefit analysis of an exotic invading alien species, a posteriori cost-benefit analysis of an exotic invading alien species, as well as a method to accomplish those analyses. In the organizational field, using the mixture of fuzzy sets and the theoretical method of analysis and synthesis, studies the chronological definitions of competencies, and provides a new definition of these (Competence (organization)), which facilitates their measurement. Based on this scientific fact, Perez-Capdevila builds a work algorithm to measure competences from human perception and build maps (defining them), provides a classification of people based on the elements of their competences, provides a procedure to correlate competencies and salary, and builds a simulator that links competencies with productivity and quality of work. He created a method to determine the relationship between work competences and salaries, which evaluates the losses that can be generated due to the lack of competences (whether laboral or professional). In the same way he constructed a simulating device to relate competences with productivity of the work and quality of work. Criticizes the way in which the SWOT analysis (Strengths, Opportunities, Weaknesses and Threats) is carried out. According to Perez-Capdevila, the use of limited options to assess impacts, as well as equal weighting among all Strengths, Opportunities, Weaknesses or Threats. According to him, it is a model that does not fit reality. He proposed an alternative procedure to carry out this analysis, where he addresses the problem of inconsistency that could be generated in expert votes. He directed the first study of perception of science and technology that was carried out in Cuba, taking as a context the Guantanamo province where he resides, and stood out as a researcher in the first study of evaluation of sustainability in Cuba], in collaboration with several Cuban and Spanish universities. Contributed two new concepts: return potential and immigration potential, whose application is intended for the repopulation process of the Cuban mountains.

The family has a limited distribution, with all described species restricted to Africa and the northern temperate zone. Fossil melittids have been found occasionally in Eocene amber deposits, including those of Oise, France and the Baltic amber. Evolution Early molecular work suggested that the family Melittidae was sister to all other bees, and also that it was paraphyletic. Because of this finding, it was suggested that the three subfamilies of Melittidae should be elevated to family status. Neither study included many melittids, due to their rarity. Later studies suggested that the family could still be monophyletic and a 2013 investigation including a greater number of melittid bees further supports this. Recent research has shown that Melittids have a lower extinction rate compared to other hymenopterans, yet this family is considered species-poor. This is attributed to a significantly lower diversification rate as seen in other bee families. Danforth et al. suggests that this is because they are oligoleges. Whereas other bees express polylecty (diverse host-plant preferences) allowing them to increase their diversification rate compared to melittids. Evidence of oil- collection behaviour has been present in melittids since the early Eocene. Amber from Oise, France provided the oldest record of Melittidae and the fourth oldest fossilized bee specimen. Characteristics Melittids are typically small to moderate-sized bees, which are well known for their specialist and oligolectic foraging habits. Melittids are strictly solitary and they nest in burrows that they dig in soil or sand. All females can reproduce and tend to emerge from the ground some days before the male. They generally mate on host-plants surrounding the area they have emerged. After mating, the gravid female creates a burrow where they bring pollen. On top of the pollen, one egg is laid. This is consumed by the larva over 10 days, after which the larva overwinters and pupates in the next year. Many melittids (such as Macropis) possess specialized morphology that allow them to collect floral oil. Classification The following genera are classified under Melittidae: *Afrodasypoda *Capicola *Ceratomonia *Dasypoda *Eremaphanta *Haplomelitta *Hesperapis *Macropis *Magnomia *Melitta *Pseudophilanthus *Promelitta *Rediviva *Redivivoides *Samba *Uronomia Citations Sources    * External links * Online guides to eastern North American Melittidae Category:Bee families Category:Hymenoptera of Africa Category:Eocene insects Category:Cenozoic insects Category:Extant Eocene first appearances ","title":"Melittidae"},{"id":"50487775","text":"ADIT (the Advanced Diploma in International Taxation) is a professional qualification and credential, offered globally by the UK-based Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) to international tax professionals.

It also includes, to some extent, the US, though the main article here is American literature. Modernism is a major literary movement of the first part of the twentieth-century. The term Postmodern literature is used to describe certain tendencies in post-World War II literature. Irish writers were especially important in the twentieth-century, including James Joyce and later Samuel Beckett, both central figures in the Modernist movement. Americans, like poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and novelist William Faulkner, were other important modernists. British modernists include Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, and D. H. Lawrence. In the mid-twentieth-century major writers started to appear in the various countries of the British Commonwealth, including several Nobel laureates.  1901–22 modernism Joseph Conrad, 1904 In the early 20th-century literary modernism developed in the English-speaking world due to a general sense of disillusionment with the Victorian era attitudes of certainty, conservatism, and belief in the idea of objective truth.M. H. Abrams,A Glossary of literary Terms (7th edition). (New York: Harcourt Brace), 1999), p. 167. The movement was influenced by the ideas of Charles Darwin (1809–82) (On Origin of Species) (1859), Ernst Mach (1838–1916), Henri Bergson (1859–1941), Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), James G. Frazer (1854–1941), Karl Marx (1818–83) (Das Kapital, 1867), and the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), among others.M. H. Abrams, p. 167. The continental art movements of Impressionism, and later Cubism, were also important inspirations for modernist writers.M. H. Abrams, p. 168. Important literary precursors of modernism, were: Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–81) (Crime and Punishment (1866), The Brothers Karamazov (1880); Walt Whitman (1819–92) (Leaves of Grass) (1855–91); Charles Baudelaire (1821–67) (Les Fleurs du mal), Rimbaud (1854–91) (Illuminations, 1874); August Strindberg (1849–1912), especially his later plays.Marshall Berman, All that is Solid Melts into Air. (Harmsworth: Penguin,1988), p. 23. A major British lyric poet of the first decades of the 20th century was Thomas Hardy (1840–1928). Though not a modernist, Hardy was an important transitional figure between the Victorian era and the 20th century. A major novelist of the late 19th century, Hardy, after the adverse criticism of his last novel, Jude the Obscure, concentrated on publishing poetry. On the other hand, another significant transitional figure between Victorians and modernists, the late-19th-century novelist, Henry James (1843–1916), continued to publish major works into the 20th century. James, born in the US, lived in Europe from 1875, and became a British citizen in 1915. Another immigrant, Polish-born modernist novelist Joseph Conrad (1857–1924) published his first important work, Heart of Darkness, in 1899 and Lord Jim in 1900. The American exponent of Naturalism Theodore Dreiser's (1871–1945) Sister Carrie was also published in 1900. =Poetry= However, the Victorian Gerard Manley Hopkins's (1844–89) highly original poetry was not published until 1918, long after his death, while the career of another major modernist poet, Irishman W. B. Yeats (1865–1939), began late in the Victorian era. Yeats was one of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature. A pillar of both the Irish and British literary establishments, in his later years he served as an Irish Senator for two terms. Yeats was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival. In 1923 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first Irishman so honoured.. Yeats is generally considered one of the few writers who completed their greatest works after being awarded the Nobel Prize: these works include The Tower (1928) and The Winding Stair and Other Poems (1929).. In addition to W. B. Yeats other important early modernist poets were the American poets T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) and Ezra Pound (1885–1972). Eliot became a British citizen in 1927 but was born and educated in America. His most famous works are: \\"Prufrock\\" (1915), The Wasteland (1921) and Four Quartets (1935–42). Ezra Pound was not only a major poet, first publishing part of The Cantos in 1917, but an important mentor for other poets, most significantly in his editorial advice for Eliot's poem The Wasteland.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble, p. 791. Other important American poets writing early in the 20th century were William Carlos Williams (1883–1963), Robert Frost (1874–1963), who published his first collection in England in 1913, and H.D. (1886–1961). Gertrude Stein (1874–1946), an American expatriate living in Paris, famous for her line \\"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,\\" was also an important literary force during this time period. American poet Marianne Moore (1887–1972) published from the 1920s to the 1960s. But while modernism was to become an important literary movement in the early decades of the new century, there were also many fine writers who, like Thomas Hardy, were not modernists. During the early decades of the 20th century the Georgian poets like Rupert Brooke (1887–1915), Walter de la Mare (1873–1956), and John Masefield (1878–1967, Poet Laureate from 1930) maintained a conservative approach to poetry by combining romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism, sandwiched as they were between the Victorian era, with its strict classicism, and Modernism, with its strident rejection of pure aestheticism. Edward Thomas (1878–1917) is sometimes treated as another Georgian poet. Thomas enlisted in 1915 and is one of the First World War poets along with Wilfred Owen (1893–1918), Rupert Brooke (1887–1915), Isaac Rosenberg (1890–1917), Edmund Blunden (1896–1974) and Siegfried Sassoon (1886–1967). =Drama= Irish playwrights George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) and J.M. Synge (1871–1909) were influential in British drama. Shaw's career began in the last decade of the 19th century, while Synge's plays belong to the first decade of the 20th century. Synge's most famous play, The Playboy of the Western World, \\"caused outrage and riots when it was first performed\\" in Dublin in 1907.The Oxford Companion to English Literature. (1996), p. 781. George Bernard Shaw turned the Edwardian theatre into an arena for debate about important political and social issues, like marriage, class, \\"the morality of armaments and war\\" and the rights of women.\\"English literature.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 15 November 2012. . An important dramatist in the 1920s, and later, was Irishman Seán O'Casey (1880–1964). Also in the 1920s and later Noël Coward (1899–1973) achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as Hay Fever (1925), Private Lives (1930), Design for Living (1932), Present Laughter (1942) and Blithe Spirit (1941), have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. =Novelists= Amongst the novelists, after Joseph Conrad, other important early modernists include Dorothy Richardson (1873–1957), whose novel Pointed Roof (1915), is one of the earliest example of the stream of consciousness technique, and D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930), who published The Rainbow in 1915, though it was immediately seized by the police.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble, p. 562. Then in 1922 Irishman James Joyce's important modernist novel Ulysses appeared. Ulysses has been called \\"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement\\".Beebe, Maurice (Fall 1972). \\"Ulysses and the Age of Modernism\\". James Joyce Quarterly (University of Tulsa) 10 (1): p. 176. Set during one day in Dublin, in it Joyce creates parallels with Homer's epic poem the Odyssey. William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury (1929) is another significant modernist novel, that uses the stream of consciousness technique. Rudyard Kipling Novelists who are not considered modernists include: Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) who was also a successful poet; H. G. Wells (1866–1946); John Galsworthy (1867–1933), (Nobel Prize in Literature, 1932) whose works include a sequence of novels, collectively called The Forsyte Saga (1906–21); Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) author of The Old Wives' Tale (1908); G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936); and E.M. Forster's (1879–1970), though Forster's work is \\"frequently regarded as containing both modernist and Victorian elements\\".The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, ed. Marion Wynne Davies (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p. 118. H. G. Wells was a prolific author who is now best known for his science fiction novels,Adam Charles Roberts (2000), \\"The History of Science Fiction\\": p. 48 in Science Fiction, Routledge, . most notably The War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, The Invisible Man and The Island of Doctor Moreau all written in the 1890s. Other novels include Kipps (1905) and Mr Polly (1910). Forster's most famous work, A Passage to India 1924, reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier novels, such as A Room with a View (1908) and Howards End (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of Edwardian society in England. Another major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is A Voyage to Arcturus by Scottish writer David Lindsay, first published in 1920. It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by writer Colin Wilson as the \\"greatest novel of the twentieth century\\",Book Review: A Voyage to Arcturus (1920) by David Lindsay – Review by Paul M. Kieniewicz 2003 and was a central influence on C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy.Kathryn Lindskoog – A Voyage to Arcturus, C. S. Lewis, and The Dark Tower The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably Rudyard Kipling, a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems, and to date the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (1907). Kipling's works include The Jungle Books (1894–95), The Man Who Would Be King and Kim (1901), while his inspirational poem \\"If—\\" (1895) is a national favourite and a memorable evocation of Victorian stoicism. Kipling's reputation declined during his lifetime, but more recently postcolonial studies has \\"rekindled an intense interest in his work, viewing it as both symptomatic and critical of imperialist attitudes\\".\\"Rudyard Kipling.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 15 November 2012. . Strongly influenced by his Christian faith, G. K. Chesterton was a prolific and hugely influential writer with a diverse output. His best-known character is the priest-detective Father Brown, who appeared only in short stories, while The Man Who Was Thursday published in 1908 is arguably his best-known novel. Of his nonfiction, Charles Dickens: A Critical Study (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise . James Joyce, 1918 Modernism in the 1920s and 1930s The modernist movement continued through the 1920s and 1930s and beyond. During the period between the World Wars, American drama came to maturity, thanks in large part to the works of Eugene O'Neill (1888–1953). O'Neill's experiments with theatrical form and his use of both Naturalist and Expressionist techniques had a major influence on American dramatists. His best-known plays include Anna Christie (Pulitzer Prize 1922), Desire Under the Elms (1924), Strange Interlude (Pulitzer Prize 1928), Mourning Becomes Electra (1931). In poetry Hart Crane published The Bridge in 1930 and E. E. Cummings and Wallace Stevens were publishing from the 1920s until the 1950s. Similarly William Faulkner continued to publish until the 1950s and was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1949. However, not all those writing in these years were modernists; among the writers outside the movement were American novelists Theodore Dreiser, Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald (The Great Gatsby 1925), and John Steinbeck. Virginia Woolf, 1927 Important British writers between the World Wars, include the Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid (1892–1978), who began publishing in the 1920s, and novelists Virginia Woolf (1882–1941), E. M. Forster (1879–1970) (A Passage to India, 1924), Evelyn Waugh (1903–66), P. G. Wodehouse (1881–1975) (who was not a modernist) and D. H. Lawrence. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover was published privately in Florence in 1928, though the unexpurgated version was not published in Britain until 1959. Woolf was an influential feminist, and a major stylistic innovator associated with the stream-of-consciousness technique in novels like Mrs Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927). Her 1929 essay A Room of One's Own contains her famous dictum \\"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\\".Sue Roe and Susan Sellers The Cambridge companion to Virginia Woolf (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 219. In the 1930s W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood co-authored verse dramas, of which The Ascent of F6 (1936) is the most notable, that owed much to Bertolt Brecht. T. S. Eliot had begun this attempt to revive poetic drama with Sweeney Agonistes in 1932, and this was followed by The Rock (1934), Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and Family Reunion (1939). There were three further plays after the war. In Parenthesis, a modernist epic poem by David Jones (1895–1974) first published in 1937, is probably the best known contribution from Wales to the literature of the First World War. An important development, beginning in the 1930s and 1940s was a tradition of working class novels actually written by working- class background writers. Among these were coal miner Jack Jones, James Hanley, whose father was a stoker and who also went to sea as a young man, and coal miners Lewis Jones from South Wales and Harold Heslop from County Durham. Aldous Huxley (1894–1963) published his famous dystopia Brave New World in 1932, the same year as John Cowper Powys's A Glastonbury Romance. Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer then appeared in 1934, though it was banned for many years in both Britain and America. Samuel Beckett (1906–89) published his first major work, the novel Murphy in 1938. This same year Graham Greene's (1904–91) first major novel Brighton Rock was published. Then in 1939 James Joyce's published Finnegans Wake, in which he creates a special language to express the consciousness of a dreaming character. It was also in 1939 that another Irish modernist poet, W. B. Yeats, died. British poet W. H. Auden was another significant modernist in the 1930s.  1940 to 2000 Though some have seen modernism ending by around 1939,. with regard to English literature, \\"When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred\\".. In fact a number of modernists were still living and publishing in the 1950s and 1960, including T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, and Ezra Pound. Furthermore, Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published little until Briggflatts in 1965 and Samuel Beckett, born in Ireland in 1906, continued to produce significant works until the 1980s, including Waiting for Godot (1953), Happy Days (1961), Rockaby (1981), though some view him as a post-modernist.The Cambridge Companion to Irish Literature, ed. John Wilson Foster. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. George Orwell, 1933 Among British writers in the 1940s and 1950s were novelist Graham Greene whose works span the 1930s to the 1980s and poet Dylan Thomas, while Evelyn Waugh, and W. H. Auden continued publishing significant work. =The novel= In 1947 Malcolm Lowry published Under the Volcano, while George Orwell's dystopia of totalitarianism, 1984, was published in 1949. One of the most influential novels of the immediate post-war period was William Cooper's naturalistic Scenes from Provincial Life, a conscious rejection of the modernist tradition.. Graham Greene was a convert to Catholicism and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Notable for an ability to combine serious literary acclaim with broad popularity, his novels include Brighton Rock (1938), The Power and the Glory (1940), The Heart of the Matter (1948), A Burnt-Out Case (1961), and The Human Factor (1978). Other novelists writing in the 1950s and later were: Anthony Powell whose twelve-volume cycle of novels A Dance to the Music of Time, is a comic examination of movements and manners, power and passivity in English political, cultural and military life in the mid-20th century; comic novelist Kingsley Amis is best known for his academic satire Lucky Jim (1954); Nobel Prize laureate William Golding's allegorical novel Lord of the Flies 1954, explores how culture created by man fails, using as an example a group of British schoolboys marooned on a deserted island who try to govern themselves, but with disastrous results. Philosopher Iris Murdoch was a prolific writer of novels throughout the second half of the 20th century, that deal especially with sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious, including Under the Net (1954), The Black Prince (1973) and The Green Knight (1993). Scottish writer Muriel Spark pushed the boundaries of realism in her novels. Her first, The Comforters (1957) concerns a woman who becomes aware that she is a character in a novel; The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961), at times takes the reader briefly into the distant future, to see the various fates that befall its characters. Anthony Burgess is especially remembered for his dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange (1962), set in the not-too-distant future, which was made into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. In the entirely different genre of Gothic fantasy Mervyn Peake (1911–68) published his highly successful Gormenghast trilogy between 1946 and 1959. One of Penguin Books' most successful publications in the 1970s was Richard Adams's heroic fantasy Watership Down (1972). Evoking epic themes, it recounts the odyssey of a group of rabbits seeking to establish a new home. Another successful novel of the same era was John Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969), with a narrator who freely admits the fictive nature of his story, and its famous alternative endings. This was made into a film in 1981 with a screenplay by Harold Pinter. Angela Carter (1940–92) was a novelist and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism, and picaresque works. Her novels include, The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman 1972 and Nights at the Circus 1984. Margaret Drabble (born 1939) is a novelist, biographer and critic, who published from the 1960s into the 21st century. Her older sister, A. S. Byatt (born 1936) is best known for Possession published in 1990. Martin Amis (born 1949) is one of the most prominent of contemporary British novelists. His best-known novels are Money (1984) and London Fields (1989). Pat Barker (born 1943) has won many awards for her fiction. English novelist and screenwriter Ian McEwan (born 1948) is another of contemporary Britain's most highly regarded writers. His works include The Cement Garden (1978) and Enduring Love (1997), which was made into a film. In 1998 McEwan won the Man Booker Prize with Amsterdam. Atonement (2001) was made into an Oscar-winning film. McEwan was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 2011. Zadie Smith's Whitbread Book Award winning novel White Teeth (2000), mixes pathos and humour, focusing on the later lives of two war time friends in London. Julian Barnes (born 1946) is another successful living novelist, who won the 2011 Man Booker Prize for his book The Sense of an Ending, while three of his earlier books were shortlisted for the Booker Prize: Flaubert's Parrot (1984), England, England (1998), and Arthur & George (2005). He has also written crime fiction under the pseudonym Dan Kavanagh. Two significant contemporary Irish novelists are John Banville (born 1945) and Colm Tóibín (born 1955). Banville is also an adapter of dramas, a screenwriter,\\"John Banville\\". Dictionary of Irish Literature, ed. Robert Hogan (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1996). and a writer of detective novels under the pseudonym Benjamin Black. Banville has won numerous awards: The Book of Evidence was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the Guinness Peat Aviation award in 1989; his eighteenth novel, The Sea, won the Booker Prize in 2005; he was awarded the Franz Kafka Prize in 2011. Colm Tóibín (Irish, 1955) is a novelist, short story writer, essayist, playwright, journalist, critic, and, most recently, poet. Scotland has in the late 20th century produced several important novelists, including James Kelman, who like Samuel Beckett can create humour out of the most grim situations. How Late it Was, How Late, 1994, won the Booker Prize that year; A. L. Kennedy's 2007 novel Day was named Book of the Year in the Costa Book Awards. In 2007 she won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature; Alasdair Gray's Lanark: A Life in Four Books (1981) is a dystopian fantasy set in a surreal version of Glasgow called Unthank.Janice Galloway \\"Rereading Lanark by Alasdair Gray\\". The Guardian. Saturday 12 October 2002 =Drama= An important cultural movement in the British theatre which developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s was Kitchen sink realism (or \\"kitchen sink drama\\"), a term coined to describe art (the term itself derives from an expressionist painting by John Bratby), novels, film and television plays. The term angry young men was often applied to members of this artistic movement. It used a style of social realism which depicts the domestic lives of the working class, to explore social issues and political issues. The drawing room plays of the post war period, typical of dramatists like Terence Rattigan and Noël Coward were challenged in the 1950s by these Angry Young Men, in plays like John Osborne's Look Back in Anger (1956). Arnold Wesker and Nell Dunn also brought social concerns to the stage. Again in the 1950s, the absurdist play Waiting for Godot (1955) (originally En attendant Godot, 1952), by Irish writer Samuel Beckett profoundly affected British drama. The Theatre of the Absurd influenced Harold Pinter (born 1930), author of (The Birthday Party, 1958), whose works are often characterised by menace or claustrophobia. Beckett also influenced Tom Stoppard (born 1937) (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, 1966). Stoppard's works are however also notable for their high-spirited wit and the great range of intellectual issues which he tackles in different plays. Both Pinter and Stoppard continued to have new plays produced into the 1990s. Michael Frayn (born 1933) is among other playwrights noted for their use of language and ideas. He is also a novelist. He has written a number of novels, including, The Tin Men, which won the 1966 Somerset Maugham Award), The Russian Interpreter (1967, Hawthornden Prize), and Spies, which won the Whitbread Prize for Fiction in 2002. Other Important playwrights whose careers began later in the century are: Caryl Churchill (Top Girls, 1982) and Alan Ayckbourn (Absurd Person Singular, 1972). Anthony Burgess, 1986 Radio drama An important new element in the world of British drama, from the beginnings of radio in the 1920s, was the commissioning of plays, or the adaption of existing plays, by BBC radio. This was especially important in the 1950s and 1960s (and from the 1960s for television). Many major British playwrights in fact, either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright Caryl Churchill's early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with The Ants, there were nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973 when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre.. Joe Orton's dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play The Ruffian on the Stair, which was broadcast on 31 August 1964.. Tom Stoppard's \\"first professional production was in the fifteen-minute Just Before Midnight programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists\\". John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel Like Men Betrayed for the BBC Light Programme. But he made his debut as an original playwright with The Dock Brief, starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Radio's Third Programme, later televised with the same cast, and subsequently presented in a double bill with What Shall We Tell Caroline? at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958, before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. Mortimer is most famous for Rumpole of the Bailey a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes... Other notable radio dramatists included Brendan Behan, and novelist Angela Carter. Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC radio, from the early 1970s.. Irish playwright Brendan Behan, author of The Quare Fellow (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play The Big House (1956); prior to this he had written two plays Moving Outand A Garden Party for Irish radio.. Among the most famous works created for radio, are Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood (1954), Samuel Beckett's All That Fall (1957), Harold Pinter's A Slight Ache (1959) and Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons (1954).JC Trewin, \\"Critic on the Hearth.\\" Listener [London, England] 5 August 1954: 224. Samuel Beckett wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950s and 1960s, and later for television. Beckett's radio play Embers was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959, and won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year.. =Poetry= Major poets like T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas were still publishing in this period. Though W. H. Auden's (1907–1973) career began in the 1930s and 1940s he published several volumes in the 1950s and 1960s. His stature in modern literature has been contested, but probably the most common critical view from the 1930s onward ranked him as one of the three major twentieth-century British poets, and heir to Eliot and Yeats.Smith, Stan (2004). \\"Introduction\\". In Stan Smith. The Cambridge Companion to W. H. Auden. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 1–14. . Stephen Spender (1909 – 1995)), whose career began in the 1930s, was another important poet. New poets starting their careers in the 1950s and 1960s include Philip Larkin (1922–85) (The Whitsun Weddings, 1964), Ted Hughes (1930–98) (The Hawk in the Rain, 1957) and Irishman (Northern Ireland) Seamus Heaney (1939–2013) (Death of a Naturalist, 1966). Northern Ireland has also produced a number of other significant poets, including Derek Mahon and Paul Muldoon. In the 1960s and 1970s Martian poetry aimed to break the grip of 'the familiar', by describing ordinary things in unfamiliar ways, as though, for example, through the eyes of a Martian. Poets most closely associated with it are Craig Raine and Christopher Reid. Martin Amis, an important contemporary novelist, carried this defamiliarisation into fiction. Another literary movement in this period was the British Poetry Revival, a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings which embraces performance, sound and concrete poetry. Leading poets associated with this movement include J. H. Prynne, Eric Mottram, Tom Raworth, Denise Riley and Lee Harwood. The Mersey Beat poets were Adrian Henri, Brian Patten and Roger McGough. Their work was a self-conscious attempt at creating an English equivalent to the Beats. Many of their poems were written in protest against the established social order and, particularly, the threat of nuclear war. Other noteworthy later 20th-century poets are Welshman R. S. Thomas, Geoffrey Hill, Charles Tomlinson Carol Ann Duffy (Poet Laureate from 2009-2019) and Simon Armitage, the current laureate. Geoffrey Hill (born 1932) is considered one of the most distinguished English poets of his generation,. Although frequently described as a \\"difficult\\" poet, Hill has retorted that supposedly difficult poetry can be \\"the most democratic because you are doing your audience the honour of supposing they are intelligent human beings\\". Charles Tomlinson (born 1927) is another important English poet of an older generation, though \\"since his first publication in 1951, has built a career that has seen more notice in the international scene than in his native England; this may explain, and be explained by, his international vision of poetry\\".. The critic Michael Hennessy has described Tomlinson as \\"the most international and least provincial English poet of his generation\\".. His poetry has won international recognition and has received many prizes in Europe and the United States. =Writers of the British Commonwealth= Doris Lessing, Cologne, 2006. Doris Lessing from Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, published her first novel The Grass is Singing in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the nobel prize for literature in 2007. Her other works include a sequence of five novels collectively called Children of Violence (1952–69), The Golden Notebook (1962), The Good Terrorist (1985), and a sequence of five science fiction novels the Canopus in Argos: Archives (1979–83). Indeed, from 1950 on a significant number of major writers came from countries that had over the centuries been settled by the British, other than America which had been producing significant writers from at least the Victorian period. There had of course been a few important works in English prior to 1950 from the then British Empire. The South African writer Olive Schreiner's famous novel The Story of an African Farm was published in 1883 and New Zealander Katherine Mansfield published her first collection of short stories, In a German Pension, in 1911. The first major English-language novelist from the Indian sub-continent, R. K. Narayan, began publishing in England in the 1930s, encouraged by English novelist Graham Greene. Caribbean writer Jean Rhys's writing career began as early as 1928, though her most famous work, Wide Sargasso Sea, was not published until 1966. South Africa's Alan Paton's famous Cry, the Beloved Country dates from 1948. Salman Rushdie is among a number of post Second World War writers from the former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with Midnight's Children 1981, which was awarded both the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and Booker prize, and was named Booker of Bookers in 1993. His most controversial novel The Satanic Verses 1989, was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. V. S. Naipaul (born 1932), born in Trinidad, was another immigrant, who wrote among other things A House for Mr Biswas (1961) and A Bend in the River (1979). Naipaul won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Also from the West Indies is George Lamming (born 1927), who wrote In the Castle of My Skin (1953), while from Pakistan, came Hanif Kureshi (born 1954), a playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, novelist and short story writer. His book The Buddha of Suburbia (1990) won the Whitbread Award for the best first novel, and was also made into a BBC television series. Another important immigrant writer Kazuo Ishiguro (born 1954) was born in Japan, but his parents immigrated to Britain when he was six. His works include The Remains of the Day 1989, Never Let Me Go 2005. From Nigeria a number of writers have achieved an international reputation for works in English, including novelist Chinua Achebe, who published Things Fall Apart in 1958, as well as playwright Wole Soyinka and novelist Buchi Emecheta. Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, as did South African novelist Nadine Gordimer in 1995. Other South African writers in English are novelist J.M. Coetzee (Nobel Prize 2003) and playwright Athol Fugard. Kenya's most internationally renowned author is Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o who has written novels, plays and short stories in English. Poet Derek Walcott, from St Lucia in the Caribbean, was another Nobel Prize winner in 1992. Two Irishmen and an Australian were also winners in the period after 1940: novelist and playwright, Samuel Beckett (1969); poet Seamus Heaney (1995); Patrick White (1973), a major novelist in this period, whose first work was published in 1939. Another noteworthy Australian writer at the end of this period is poet Les Murray. The contemporary Australian novelist Peter Carey (born 1943) is one of only four writers to have won the Booker Prize twice—the others being J. G. Farrell, J. M. Coetzee and Hilary Mantel.Man Booker official site: J. G. Farrell ; Hilary Mantel ; J. M. Coetzee: . Among Canadian writers who have achieved an international reputation, are novelist and poet Margaret Atwood, poet, songwriter and novelist Leonard Cohen, short story writer Alice Munro, and more recently poet Anne Carson. Another admired Canadian novelist and poet is Michael Ondaatje, who was born in Sri Lanka. =American literature= From 1940 into the 21st century, American playwrights, poets and novelists have continued to be internationally prominent. =Post-modern literature= The term Postmodern literature is used to describe certain tendencies in post- World War II literature. It is both a continuation of the experimentation championed by writers of the modernist period (relying heavily, for example, on fragmentation, paradox, questionable narrators, etc.) and a reaction against Enlightenment ideas implicit in Modernist literature. Postmodern literature, like postmodernism as a whole, is difficult to define and there is little agreement on the exact characteristics, scope, and importance of postmodern literature. Among postmodern writers are the Americans Henry Miller, William S. Burroughs, Joseph Heller, Kurt Vonnegut, Hunter S. Thompson, Truman Capote and Thomas Pynchon.  20th-century genre literature Agatha Christie (1890–1976) was a crime writer of novels, short stories and plays, who is best remembered for her 80 detective novels as well as her successful plays for the West End theatre. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, have given her the title \\"Queen of Crime\\", and she was one of the most important and innovative writers in this genre. Christie's novels include Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile and And Then There Were None. Another popular writer during the Golden Age of detective fiction was Dorothy L. Sayers (1893–1957). Other recent noteworthy writers in this genre are Ruth Rendell, P. D. James and Scot Ian Rankin. Erskine Childers' The Riddle of the Sands (1903), is an early example of spy fiction. A noted writer in the spy novel genre was John le Carré, while in thriller writing, Ian Fleming created the character James Bond 007 in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including Casino Royale (1953), Live and Let Die (1954), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), Thunderball (1961), and nine short story works. Hungarian- born Emma Orczy's (1865–1947) original play, The Scarlet Pimpernel, opened in October 1903 at Nottingham's Theatre Royal but was not a success. However, with a rewritten last act, it opened at the New Theatre in London in January 1905. The premier of the London production was enthusiastically received by the audience, running 122 performances and enjoying numerous revivals. The Scarlet Pimpernel became a favourite of London audiences, playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in England to that date. The novel The Scarlet Pimpernel was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her \\"reckless daredevil\\" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a musical and other media. John Buchan (1875–1940) published the adventure novel The Thirty- Nine Steps in 1915. The novelist Georgette Heyer created the historical romance genre. J. R. R. Tolkien, 1940s The Kailyard school of Scottish writers, notably J. M. Barrie (1869–1937), creator of Peter Pan (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought of fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, Kenneth Grahame (1859–1932) wrote the children's classic The Wind in the Willows. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the \\"Inklings\\". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Lewis is especially known for The Chronicles of Narnia, while Tolkien is best known as the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Another significant writer is Alan Garner author of Elidor (1965), while Terry Pratchett is a more recent fantasy writer. Roald Dahl rose to prominence with his children's fantasy novels, such as James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, often inspired by experiences from his childhood, which are notable for their often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour. J. K. Rowling author of the highly successful Harry Potter series and Philip Pullman famous for his His Dark Materials trilogy are other significant authors of fantasy novels for younger readers. Noted writers in the field of comic books are Neil Gaiman, and Alan Moore; Gaiman also produces graphic novels. In the later decades of the 20th Century, the genre of science fiction began to be taken more seriously because of the work of writers such as Arthur C. Clarke's (2001: A Space Odyssey), Isaac Asimov, Ursula K. Le Guin, Robert Heinlein, Michael Moorcock and Kim Stanley Robinson. Another prominent writer in this genre, Douglas Adams, is particularly associated with the comic science fiction work, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which began life as a radio series in 1978. Mainstream novelists such Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood also wrote works in this genre, while Scottish novelist Ian M. Banks has also achieved a reputation as both a writer of traditional and science fiction novels.

Slipper champagne In the 20th century, the act of drinking champagne from a lady's slipper became a shorthand for decadence and sophistication. The practice is thought to have originated in 1902 at the Everleigh Club, a high-class brothel in Chicago. When a dancer's slipper fell to the floor, a member of Prince Henry of Prussia's entourage picked it up and used it to drink champagne. Military traditions A glass Bierstiefel Drinking from another soldier's boot was a traditional hazing ritual in the German army, and soldiers would drink from the general's boot after a victory. During World War I, German soldiers were said to pass around a leather boot filled with beer, to bring good luck before a battle. The drinkers would flick the boot before and after taking a drink from it. The idea that drinking from a shoe or boot can bring good fortune dates back to the Middle Ages. The German Bierstiefel is a boot-shaped beer glass said to have been created by a Prussian general in an unnamed war who promised his troops that if they were victorious in an upcoming battle, he would drink beer from his own boot. After they won the battle the general had second thoughts, and instead ordered a glass imitation to be made. In a 1972 episode of the US television series M*A*S*H titled \\"Yankee Doodle Doctor\\", a black and white film is made by the doctors in which they are seen at party drinking from shoes. Shoey The shoey is particularly popular in, but not limited to, Australia. The drinker either removes their own shoe, or nominates a friend's shoe to be used as the vessel. The shoe is tilted and the entire contents of a can of beer are poured into the shoe's opening. Once the beverage has settled, the beer is drunk by tipping the shoe up to the mouth and chugging it. The drink most commonly used for a shoey is beer, however other alcoholic beverages are also used. Australian Formula One racer Daniel Ricciardo has said \\"If the sparkling wine is cold, then it tastes good. If it's warm then you might get the sweat through it but the cold taste kills the bad stuff... so it's delicious.\\"http://www.skysports.com/f1/news/24239/10578877/daniel-ricciardo- explains-his-shoey-podium-celebration-and-the-taste In 2015, after Supercars driver David Reynolds won the first non-endurance race of his career, he proceeded to drink champagne from his shoe while celebrating on the podium. Also in 2015, DJ Dillon Francis did a shoey on stage at Sydney's Field Day. More international media attention was received in 2016 after MotoGP rider Jack Miller celebrated his first win and drank champagne from his racing boot during the podium presentation.Jack Miller drinks champagne from his boot Following a podium at the 2016 San Marino MotoGP round, Italian racer Valentino Rossi was the first non-Australian competitor to embrace and perform a shoey. Daniel Ricciardo performing a shoey with Patrick Stewart at the 2017 Canadian Grand Prix Daniel Ricciardo introduced the trend to Formula One in 2016, when he celebrated a podium finish at the by performing a champagne shoey. Ricciardo repeated the stunt at the following , this time sharing it with Mark Webber. On the podium of the , winner Ricciardo shared his shoey with his second-placed teammate Max Verstappen and third-placed Nico Rosberg as well as his team boss Christian Horner. Scottish actor Gerard Butler drank Red Bull from a shoe with Ricciardo at the US Grand Prix podium, as did Patrick Stewart on the podium of the 2017 Canadian Grand Prix. Ricciardo shared his shoey with Canadian rookie driver Lance Stroll on the podium of the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which was Stroll's first podium of his F1 career and Ricciardo's fifth win. Ricciardo credits the creation of the shoey to \\"a few Aussies called the Mad Hueys\\", saying that they \\"basically travel the world fishing and surfing and they like to drink a lot of beer – so that's where the shoey began\\". On the podium of the 2017 Austrian Grand Prix, interviewer Martin Brundle drank from third-placed Ricciardo's shoe, but winner Valtteri Bottas and runner-up Sebastian Vettel declined the offer. Australian cricketer Andrew Tye had promised to do the shoey if his team Kings XI Punjab would have won the Indian Premier League in 2019. The shoey was popular during the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 2016 season when it became a tradition for fans to perform shoeys at games. This coincided with the club winning their first NRL premiership at the end of the season, with numerous players such as James Maloney doing shoeys at celebrations. Commonly, Hash House Harriers who wear new shoes to an event can be required to drink from that shoe.

An essentially linear district extending along Main Street (United States Route 7) on either side of School Street, it has a well-preserved array of 19th and early-20th century residential, commercial, and civic buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history Wallingford is a small agricultural community in the Otter Creek valley of central Vermont, south of Rutland. It was settled in the 1770s, with its main village established on Roaring Brook, a tributary of Otter Creek. It developed as an agricultural area, and as a stop on the north-south stagecoach route, now US 7. The village center developed as a commercial center, serving the area farmers, and housed local industries such as sawmills, tanneries, and a blacksmith. The stage route was the only significant road in the village, with School Street (Vermont Route 140) emerging later as a major cross street, running east-west north of Roaring Brook. In 1835, Lyman Batcheller opened a pitchfork manufactory, which expanded significantly after the railroad arrived 1852. These industries declined in the early 20th century, as did agriculture, which has been partially supplanted by the summer tourist trade. Most of the village's development after 1920 has taken place on side streets, leaving its Main Street with a largely turn-of-the-20th-century appearance. The historic district extends along Main Street, from Franklin and Meacham Streets in the north, to just south of the Green Hill Cemetery in the south, and includes a few buildings facing School Street near the central junction of School and Main. Most of the buildings in the district are residential, in a cross section of architectural styles. Prominent civic and religious buildings in the district include the town hall and Baptist Church (both on School Street) and the Renaissance Revival library. Commercial buildings include the Italianate Odd Fellows block, and the Georgian Revival True Temper Inn.

Biography  Olive, the son of a wine merchant, was born in Marseille's Saint-Martin neighbourhood. Étienne Cornellier, a decorator, encouraged him to register at École des beaux-arts de Marseille where he studied under the guidance of Joanny Rave. There he received several awards including, in 1871, the live model class's first prize. While training as a decorator, he painted many scenes of Marseille, its Vieux-Port, its islands, and its seashore. In 1874 he travelled to Italy, mainly to Genoa and Venice. He occasionally participated in some of Provence's exhibitions at the time. In 1882 he relocated to Paris. He contributed to the decoration of Cirque d’Hiver, Basilica of the Sacré Cœur and Exposition universelle de 1889 (he was awarded a silver medal for the latter). From 1874 onward he exhibited repeatedly at Salon de Paris and was awarded several prizes there. In 1881 he became a member of Société des Artistes Français. In 1900 he won an order by the company Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée for two paintings created to as decoration for the Golden Room at Le Train Bleu (restaurant) designed by architect Marius Toudoire in the Paris- Gare de Lyon train station (both paintings can still be seen there). In 1930, aged 82, he was awarded the Léon Bonnat prize. In addition to Étienne Cornellier, his friends were painters Gustave Marius Jullien (1825-1881), Antoine Vollon, Robert Mols, Raymond Allègre and Théophile Décanis. He was supported by several patrons, among them General Malesherbes and Marie-Louis Gassier, the owner of company Berger, a producer of pastis. In 1948, twelve years after his death, Marseille's Musée Cantini dedicated an exhibition to his centenary, displaying eighty-two of his paintings.  Artwork  Although relatively little-known outside France - unlike his Marseillais fellow citizen Adolphe Monticelli -, Olive is one of Provence's most iconic painters and an emblematic figure of the French marine art movement. While proud of his Marseille origins, he long remained doubtful of his own painting talent. His introverted - decidedly un-Mediterranean - character was in sheer contrast with his artwork's dazzling luminosity. His favourite themes are the sea, seashores and ports. His views of le Vieux-Port, in which the rendering of light compares to that of Félix Ziem's paintings, are especially well-known, together with his calanques (a local term for cliff-edged inlets along the coast between Marseille and La Ciotat). Quite intriguingly, his views of le Vieux-Port depict it as seen from offshore, not from the ground. His still lifes, the early ones frugal, the later ones more opulent and varied, generally focus on Provence fruits and ornamental tableware. \\"The light's \\"timing\\", its penetration on the firm ground, its diffusion and fugitive nature are his artwork's constitutive elements.\\" Translated excerpt from museeregardsdeprovence.com  Public collections  * Paris-Gare de Lyon train station, golden room of Le Train Bleu (restaurant) : ** Le Vieux port de Marseille, 1900, oil on canvas ** Saint-Honorat, 1901, oil on canvas * Marseille, musée Cantini : ** Carry-le-Rouet, prior to 1917, oil on canvas ** L'Épave de la Navarre, près de Carry, prior to 1917, oil on canvas ** Tempête, avant 1917, oil on canvas * Marseille, musée Grobet-Labadié : Une Vague, oil on canvas * Musée des beaux-arts de Marseille : ** La Corniche à Marseille, oil on canvas ** La Salute à Venise, oil on canvas ** Marine, oil on canvas * Musée des beaux-arts de Béziers : Nature morte aux fruits, 1872, oil on canvas * Musée d'art de Toulon : ** Port de Toulon, 1878, oil on canvas ** Calanque d'en Vau * Le Havre, Museum of modern art André Malraux - MuMa : La Falaise, oil on canvas * Colmar, Haut-Rhin prefecture : Le Soir, rade de Villefranche, 1893, India ink scratchboard.

Primarily designed by Gesellius, Lindgren & Saarinen and constructed in 1899-1901, it is a prominent example of Finnish national romantic architecture. It was acquired in 1972 by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, now succeeded by Nordea. Background The Pohjola Insurance Company (precursor of OP Financial Group) was founded in 1891 and specialised in fire insurance. They held a competition for the design of their headquarters, which would also house another Fennomane insurance company, Kullervo, with the specification that the building must be of fire-resistant stone. Based on the submissions, they commissioned Gesellius, Lindgren & Saarinen to design the exteriors and major interior spaces, but Ines and Ernst A.

In April 2016, it had been used by over 1 million people monthly, up from 525,000 in 2015. Neither Twitter nor Google operate sites through Tor, and Facebook has been applauded for allowing such access, which makes it available in countries that actively try to block Facebook. In October 2014, Facebook announced that users could connect to the website through a Tor onion service using the privacy- protecting Tor browser and encrypted using HTTPS. Announcing the feature, Alec Muffett said \\"Facebook's onion address provides a way to access Facebook through Tor without losing the cryptographic protections provided by the Tor cloud. ... it provides end-to-end communication, from your browser directly into a Facebook datacentre.\\" Its network address – facebookcorewwwi.onion – is a backronym that stands for Facebook's Core WWW Infrastructure. Prior to the release of an official .onion domain, accessing Facebook through Tor would sometimes lead to error messages and inability to access the website. There are numerous reasons to use the Tor-protocol for legitimate purposes, such as for increased anonymity when connecting to Facebook. ProPublica explicitly referenced the existence of Facebook's .onion site when they started their own onion service. Connecting to Facebook through Tor offers a way to access the site with a higher level of protection against snooping and surveillance from both commercial and state actors. The site also makes it easier for Facebook to differentiate between accounts that have been caught up in a botnet and those that legitimately access Facebook through Tor. As of its 2014 release, the site was still in early stages, with much work remaining to polish the code for Tor-access. It has been speculated that other companies will follow suit and release their own Tor-accessible sites. The site went offline at noon GMT on 13 December 2019, as the certificate used to provide HTTPS support expired. Facebook claimed the site would be back online within 1 to 2 weeks as they sourced a new certificate. It went back online on 18 December.

Fronted by Don Gallucci, former keyboardist of the Kingsmen, the group made a name for itself in the Northwest rock scene performing in a similar style as their contemporaries the Wailers and the Sonics. Over time, Don and the Goodtimes honed their vocal harmonies and earned two hits on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967, including their biggest hit \\"I Could Be So Good to You\\". The band released their album, So Good, and later experimented with psychedelia under the moniker Touch before disbanding in 1969. History Don Galluci (keyboards) was immersed in the Northwest rock scene early on as a member of the Kingsmen. He enjoyed early success with the band when they released the national hit, \\"Louie, Louie\\", which features him playing the song's signature keyboard riff. However, Gallucci—just 15 years of age—was deemed too young to tour in support of the record and resigned from the group in early 1964. Gallucci formed his own band with Bobby Holden, a drummer he started jamming with at a nightclub called the Chase. Members from Holden's former band, the Invaders, joined the project, including Dave Child (bass guitar) and Don McKinney (saxophone, vocals). Ex-Kingsmen Jack Ely (vocals) performed with the group—albeit briefly—and Pierre Ouellette (lead guitar), a former guitarist for Paul Revere and the Raiders, rounded-out the original Don and the Goodtimes line-up. Thanks to Gallucci's connections in the music industry, the group was quickly signed by record producer Jerry Dennon of Jerden Records — the same producer of early Kingsmen recordings. The band traveled to Audio Recording Studio in Seattle to cover \\"Turn On\\", an instrumental piece that was garnering success for several local teen rock groups. \\"Turn On\\" was released on the A-side of the band's debut single and received airplay in the Northwest. Holden described Don and the Goodtimes early success: \\"We went on the road backing up this record and got some local airplay! We were an interesting band because we had these R&B; roots but at the same time we realized that kids really liked show bands — like Paul Revere and the Raiders — so we amalgamated the two\\". For live performances, Don and the Goodtimes chose distinguishable attire—typically sporting suits and top hats. In 1965, after releasing their second single \\"Big Big Knight (On a Big White Horse)\\", Jim Valley of the Viceroys was brought in to replace Ouellette and occasionally share lead vocals with McKinney. Valley's role as a songwriter proved invaluable to the band on their next record, as he penned its A-side \\"Little Sally Tease\\". It furthered Don and the Goodtimes' popularity, and was covered by contemporaries such as the Standells and the Kingsmen. In mid-1965, the band was signed to Dunhill Records, and \\"Little Sally Tease\\" was released nationally. In 1966, the group made television appearances on the Lloyd Thaxton Show and Hollywood a-Go-Go, before commencing weekly performances on Dick Clark's show Where the Action Is. An album named after the program was recorded in the same year, and featured mainly renditions of popular tunes in the Northwest, including \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", \\"The Witch\\", and \\"Jolly Green Giant\\". Commenting on Don and the Goodtimes' gritty R&B; style, music critic Doug Shepherd wrote they \\"were one of the most adventurous bands in the region\\", and \\"perhaps the only band to cover 'The Witch' in a manner that did justice to the Sonics’ original\\". Accepting an offer to join Paul Revere and the Raiders, Valley departed Don and the Goodtimes, and was replaced by Charlie Coe, another Raiders alumnus. Child and McKinney also left the band, and were substituted by Rob \\"Buzz\\" Overman and Jeff Hawks respectively. In 1967, the group settled in Los Angeles and began rehearsing their vocal harmonies in preparation for their next album. About this time Charlie Coe returned to the Raiders and was replaced by guitarist Joey Newman from the Northwest band The Liberty Tree. Joining them for recording was Jack Nitzsche, who produced and arranged the album, and A-list session musicians Ry Cooder, Glen Campbell, and Hal Blaine. The album, titled So Good, was released on Epic Records, and charted at 102 nationally on the Billboard 200. Its supporting single \\"I Could Be So Good to You\\" reached number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100, but fared better on Los Angeles's regional market, where it reached number 15. A non-album single \\"Happy and Me\\" was a minor hit, peaking at number 98. Don and the Goodtimes released three more singles in 1968, none of which managed to continue their success. Overman and Holden departed the group later in the year, effectively disbanding the band. Gallucci formed another band with Hawks and Newman and new members Bruce Hauser, (bass guitar, vocals) and John Bordonaro (drums, vocals), naming it Touch. Refashioning themselves as a psychedelic rock troupe, Touch released one self-titled album in 1969. The group—unable to replicate their complex studio sound—refused to tour in support of the album, and, as a result, sales were poor. Touch disbanded soon after. Gallucci went on to become a successful record producer, working most notably on the Stooges' second album Fun House, in 1970.

It contains an example of Atlantic Forest biome. The reserve is home to rare buffy-headed marmosets and to one of the last wild populations of northern muriqui woolly spider monkeys. History Feliciano Miguel Abdalla, the son of a Lebanese immigrant, obtained the Fazenda Montes Claros estate in the state of Minas Gerais in 1944 on condition that he preserve the forest on the property. At this time the settlers in Minas Gerais were clearing the land for agriculture, and conservation was an alien concept. For many years he had to struggle against hunters and people looking to harvest timber and hearts of palm, sometimes at risk to his life. Towards the end of the 1960s Abdalla began to meet researchers. The professors Álvaro Aguirre and then Celio Valle introduced the woods to the scientific community. In 1977 professor Akira Nishimura began the first systemic study of the northern muriquis, to be followed by Russell Mittermeier and Karen B. Strier. At the time the long-term study of the muriquis began Abdala was in his 70s. Besides the forest, his farm included an active coffee plantation and cattle ranch, and employed over 20 families whose houses were on the farm. Abdala put up researchers in his farmhouse until a small vacated house on the edge of the forest had been renovated. This house became the Caratinga Biological Station (Estação Biológica de Caratinga) in May 1983. The biological station was supported by Abdala, the Federal University of Minas Gerais, the World Wildlife Fund and the Brazilian Foundation for the Conservation of Nature (FBCN). Researchers found buffy-headed marmosets, an endangered species, as well as healthy populations of brown howler and tufted capuchin monkeys. Abdalla died in June 2000 at the age of 92. The private non-profit Society for Muriqui's Preservation, \\"Preserve-Muriqui\\", created by the Abdala' family, now manages the reserve. The Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve was created by decree on 3 September 2001. Conservation International Brazil provided technical and financial support for founding the reserve in partnership with the Caratinga Biological Reserve Association and the Biodiversity Foundation (Fundação Biodiversitas). Environment The reserve is located in the municipality of Caratinga in the state of Minas Gerais. It has an area of . It is located on the left bank of the Manhuaçu River in the Doce River basin. The region has a rugged terrain with altitudes from . The reserve holds parts of the basins of the Jaó and Matão streams. The climate is hot, with average rainfall of about , falling mainly in the summer (October to March). The reserve contains an example of the Atlantic Forest biome. About 80% of the land is covered in well-preserved forest, while the remainder holds abandoned pasturage and secondary growth forest. Many of the neighbours also have small areas of forest beside the reserve. The reserve holds many endemic plants and is home to various endangered birds and mammals. Vegetation is mainly semi-deciduous forest, with the best-preserved parts in the lower areas along the two streams, where the canopy is continuous and about high with emergent trees reaching over in height. Higher up the primary forest makes way for secondary forest and then bushy scrub at the summit. The reserve is home to a population of endangered northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) spider monkeys. It has been estimated that there were a million of these monkeys when the Europeans arrived, but they are now on the list of 25 most endangered primates in the world. There were about 60 spider monkeys on the reserve when it was established. As of 2006 there were less than 1,000 surviving individuals in the world, of whom 226 were living in the reserve. By 2011 the reserve had 320 individuals, the largest concentration in the world. About 362 species of vertebrate have been recorded, including 79 species of mammal, 204 species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians. The pit viper Lachesis muta and the Natterer's longwing butterfly (Heliconius nattereri) are considered endangered. Conservation The reserve is classed as IUCN protected area category IV (habitat/species management area). It has the objective of conserving biological diversity in a private area. Preserve- Muriqui aims to guarantee survival of the northern muriqui in its natural environment and to support research, while working with the inhabitants of neighbouring properties and providing jobs for local people. The reserve has been the subject of many scientific studies including 22 independent research projects and ten PhD theses. The reserve is open to eco-tourists, providing guided tours of the forest. Fees are used to help support the reserve. Local people are employed at competitive rates on tasks such as opening trails and following the muriquis. This has contributed to local support for conservation and research in the reserve. The Preserve Muriqui has started seedlings of native trees and guided the neighbours to reforest the hilltops to revitalise the springs. It has also taught the neighbours intensive farming techniques to grow more crops while farming a smaller area. The manager of the reserve said that the proprietors of the local farms have become the guardians of the forest.

It belongs to Rohtak Division. Bhadani and Khera (Bhadana) are two villages adjacent to each other and Kheri Asra, Surkhpur, Jhajjar, Shekhupur and Kablana, Chudani are nearby villages. It is located 10 km towards East from District headquarters Jhajjar. 10 km from Jhajjar. 269 km from State capital Chandigarh. Its Pin code is 124104 and postal head office is Nehru College Jhajjar. History of Bhadani Antiquity. The history of Bhadani, a large village in Jhajjar district of Haryana dates back to 1545 -75, when two separate settlements named Rai Bhadani of Phalaswals and Chhoti Bhadani of Sehrawats came up. Two generations latter, that is, in 1620 -30, Bhadani Usman was settled by Deswals. In 1877 the village was inhabited by the twelfth generation since its establishment. Considering the fact that life-span of one generation is taken as 30 years the village would have been established in second half of Sixteenth century between 1545 –1575. These facts are recorded in the Shajra – Malikan Mouza Bhadani, Tehsil Jhajjar, District Rohtak written on 19 April 1877. Some Brahmin families who live in Bhadani are descendants of Kanwa dynasty that ruled Magadh empire from 76 BC to 26 BC. Prominent personalities of Kanwa family in Bhadani include Pandit Singh Ram Pehalwan. Name of the Village. There is no authentic record as to why name Bhadani was chosen. Ruling Deity. Ruling deity of Bhadani is Shiva in form of Ardhnariswar. Sequence of settlement of the village. The village was settled in three sequential waves. Before we attempt to establish the sequence of settlement, it is important to understand meaning of words Rai and Usman. • Rai. In the Hindu lexicon Rai stands for a sovereign king. During pre- Sultanate period, Rai was placed higher than Raja. However, during the Mughal period, Rai stood for administrator of Imperial land (Khalisa). • Usman. In Islamic lexicon Usman was the third Caliph. However, in so far as we are concerned, it is more pertinent to note that during early seventeenth century Usman was a name widely used by Afghans and during the period 1620 – 1718 Kalals, of Afghan origin, were Shiqdars of Jhajjar. Since we know that entire area of present-day Haryana was Khalisa (Imperial Land) during the Mughal period, it would be reasonable to conclude that Rai Bhadani came up when the then Rai (Administrator of Khalisa) allotted Khalisa land to farmers of Phalaswal Gotra. Chhoti Bhadani as the name suggests came up next to extant Badi (elder) Bhadani, that is, Rai Bhadani. We also know from Shajra Malikan -e - Maouza, that, the Deswals came two generations after the Phalaswals and Sehrawats and till 1877 their nine generations had lived in the village. And, one generation period is taken as 30 years. Hence Deswals would have come around 1620 - 1630. This was the period when the Afghans of Kalal Clkan were the Shiqdars of Jhajjar, and Usman is a popular name among Afghans. Hence it is quite likely that one of the Shiqdars named Usman allotted Khalisa land to Deswals sometime in 1620 – 1630 and named their settlement Bhadani Usman. Consolidation of the village. The period of 1712 – 1803 was marked by the Great Anarchy which engulfed the nation following demise of Mughal Empire. By 1750 the conditions had become so dangerous and unbearable that many families migrated to safer areas and those who stayed behind left their respective smaller Bhadanis and consolidated at the present location. Apparently this process of re-location would have taken place over a period of time, hence it is not possible to fix a date for establishment of larger Bhadani. However it is likely to have taken place sometime between 1740 – 1775. Original Khedas were located as follows: (a) Phalaswal. Present location of Bhadana. (b) Sehrawat: Somewhere towards Jhajjar on periphery of Bir Sunarwala. (c) Deswal: Somewhere towards Kablana. History of Pannas. Bhadani village has three main Pannas of Jats, namely Sehrawat, Phalaswal and Deswal and some families of Rahar besides usual mix of Brahman, Bania, Sunar, Khati, Lohar, Kumhar, Chamar and Chura families living in harmony. • Phalaswal. Sometime in 1545 – 1575 a family of Phalaswals headed by Makhha migrated from unknown place to establish Rai Bhadani. He had three sons named Puran, Issar and Kanhiya (Nanha). To commemorate the memory of Makhha, the Phalaswal Panna was also known as Makhha Panna. In the year 1754 Hemkaran of Puran branch and Raja Ram of Issar branch migrated from Bhadani. Raja Ram shifted to Pahari Dheeraj and his family has stayed there ever since. Their land was tilled by Nanha branch for next three generations. However, in the year 1807, the Nawab allotted around 1120 Bighas of Phalaswal estate to some Brahmin families whom he had brought from Patli village, District Gurgaon and settled them in a newly created village named Bhadana on the Kheda of Phalaswals. Hence when in 1810 – 12 the third generation of Hemkaran returned to reclaim their lands they found that their own share had already been given away by the Nawab to Brahmins of Bhadana. With mutual agreement the balance land was redistributed into four equal parts between Lasvid and Arjan of Puran (Hemkaran) branch and Sewga and Laxman from Kanhiya branch. Their successors are living here ever since. • Sahrawats. The Saharawat family had migrated from Mahrauli Village of Delhi district to establish Chhoti Bhadani almost simultaneously with the Phalaswals. During the period of Great Anarchy many Sharawat families migrated to other places. Family of Munia went to Bhorgarh, District Delhi. Kishan Lal son of Ram Dayal came back from Bhorgarh on 21 December 1867 to reclaim his property. Moti, went away but came back in his own life time. Sukha from Heera Thola went away to Daryapur in Delhi and his successor Hansram came back in the year 1867 to reclaim his property. Another family had shifted to Jharoda and came back once the British rule was established. In the year 1877, Saharawats had three tholas, namely Deepraj, Jadon and Heera and their successors have been living here ever since. • Deswal. The Deswal family had come here from village Aldyoka, District Gurugram and their nine generations had lived in Bhadani till 1877. Many of their families migrated from here to safer places during the Great Anarchy but most of these families returned when the law and order was re-established by the British. Their successors have been living here ever since. Deswal Pana was also known as Sarguroh pana. Surguroh in Persian means of one family. Revenue during pre – 1947 period. The revenue was charged as follows: • Nawab. The village was purchased by one Imam Khan, Tehsildar of Jhajjar on Istamrari. He used to collect one quarter of the crop as revenue on behalf of Nawab and take another 10 percent for himself as collection charge. In addition the farmer had to contribute his proportionate share in the five rupee paid collectively to the Numberdar as Pichotra and towards the pay of Patwari. Thus effective revenue taken from a farmer was 40 percent of the produce. • British. The British introduced system of direct revenue collection, wherein one quarter of the produce was taken either in cash or kind. All other taxes were removed and the Numberdars and Patwaris became government employees. Thus effective revenue taken from the farmer during the British period reduced by nearly half as compared to the Nawab's rule.

In his career he has performed with a number of high-profile artists and ensembles and has taken part in thousands of recording sessions. He is currently based in Harlem, New York City. Early life and career Brady Watt's music career started around age 14, playing bass in various groups in the New England punk scene. Before this he was a hip hop head, growing up on Wu-Tang Clan, A Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr, and others. His musicality evolved at a very fast rate under the tutelage of a few mentors and as he discovered and assimilated new styles such as various world musics, funk, and fusion. He moved to Brooklyn where he began mastering his craft by playing with a who's who of legendary musicians and artists in the city and around the world. It didn't take long for him to rise in the ranks of New York musicians and become one of the most sought-after session bass players and performers in the city. While carving his name into the scene as an A-List bass player Brady was soaking up knowledge from all the producers he was working with. His inclination was to keep it moving to the next level and start producing records on his own. His skills as a multi-instrumentalist (bass, keys, guitar, and drums) and a finely tuned taste for drum production and music synthesis/soundscaping made this move only natural. Watts has a series on youtube called \\"Bass & Bars\\", where he plays bass alongside rappers. Through the series he has worked with such artists including Melanie Fiona, Talib Kweli, Murs (rapper), Xzibit, Pharoahe Monch. Krayzie Bone, Maino, Smooth B of Nice & Smooth, among others.

On 22 September 2007, although still under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi made a brief public appearance at the gate of the house to accept the blessings of Buddhist monks during the Saffron revolution.Democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi greets Myanmar monks . AFP. 22 September 2007 On 2 May 2008, after the Cyclone Nargis, the roof of the house was damaged and Aung San Suu Kyi lived in virtual darkness after losing electricity. She used candles at night as she was not provided any generator set. The house was renovated in August 2009. On 4 May 2009, an American citizen John Yettaw trespassed the house two weeks before her scheduled release from house arrest on 27 May. It is illegal in Myanmar to have a guest stay overnight at one's home without notifying the authorities first. This illegal visit prompted Aung San Suu Kyi's arrest on 13 May 2009 and sentenced to eighteen months of house arrest, which effectively meant that she was unable to participate in the 2010 elections. On 13 November 2010, she waved from behind the gate of the house to her supporters who rushed to the house when nearby barricades were removed by the security forces, celebrating the end of her house arrest. Ownership lawsuit In 2000, Aung San Oo brought legal action against Aung San Suu Kyi in the Yangon High Court demanding a half-share of the house. There was widespread speculation among observers at the time that Aung San Oo would then sell his half-share to the ruling State Peace and Development Council junta, but the High Court ruled against him, much to the surprise of the same observers, who had assumed that it would bring down whatever verdict was preferred by the junta.TIME magazine, \\"Burmese Democracy Leader Faces New Threat\\", November 28, 2000 quote: \\"Talk about spite. First, Burma's military government told pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi that she couldn't leave Rangoon. Then they told her that she couldn't leave her house. Now, they want the house.\\" and: \\"Late last year, former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto visited Burma and met with the generals. Burma's military is anxious for Japan to resume aid to their country, which it cut off when soldiers gunned down thousands of democracy demonstrators in 1988. Hashimoto gave the generals this advice when it came to dealing with Suu Kyi and her followers: Don't back her into a corner. The generals, it appears, aren't listening.\\" Time magazine reports that, according to Burmese exiles and observers in Yangon, the junta used the alleged surrogacy of Aung San Oo and his lawsuit as an act of spite against her.NCGUB quote: \\"If he wins the case, U Aung San Oo is expected to turn his share of the house over to the government, a result which would put Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in an extremely precarious position.\\" Portrayal in film The house was featured in Luc Besson's 2011 film The Lady.

His career statistics rank him 11th in senior Canadian and professional lacrosse. Former Canadian Football League commissioner Jake Gaudaur described Bill Isaacs as \\"one of the most outstanding players that ever played the game in the thirties and forties, when lacrosse was a very big sport in Canada.\\"Obituaries (30 December 1985). \\"Bill Isaacs Lacrosse player in Hall of Fame\\". The Globe and Mail, [Toronto ON]: D.6. He has been inducted into various Canadian sports hall of fames. Major sports achievements and contributions He learned the game on the Six Nations Indian reserve and played during the game's heyday in the 1930s and '40s for Hamilton Tigers and Rochester Iroquois when pro lacrosse regularly drew up to 6,000 people a game. He left the reserve when he was 17, playing professional lacrosse in the United States before returning to Canada to play on teams in various Ontario communities. In 1932, he and his brother Lance led the Haldimand Rifles Indians team to the Ontario Amateur Lacrosse Association (O.A.L.A.) Ontario Championship title in Intermediate Lacrosse. He won the O.A.L.A. Senior A scoring crown 7 times in 8 years from 1935 until 1942 (except for 1936). In 1938 he also won the Jim Murphy Trophy as the most valuable player in the league. Isaacs was a member of two Mann Cup winning teams - in 1942 with the Mimico-Brampton Combines and in 1948 with the Hamilton Tiger team. During his 346-game career, he scored enough goals (777) and assists (467) to be ranked 11th in senior Canadian and professional history. Isaacs was rated the best centres of all-time scoring 700 goals and 1100 points. He was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1965. He was also inducted into the Brantford & Area Sports Hall of Recognition (1984), the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame (2008), the Hamilton Sports Hall of Fame (2011), and the Canada Sports Hall of Fame (2015). Contribution to Canadian sport Box lacrosse made its debut in North America in 1931. Box lacrosse was an indoor version of the field game, and borrowed heavily from ice hockey, with team owners selling this sport as \\"summertime ice hockey. The rules committee made sure that box lacrosse looked and felt like ice hockey by dividing games into three 20-minute periods and by using hockey goal nets and NHL referees. Indigenous players had their own particular groups however were invited when box lacrosse turned into the superior type of the diversion in the 1930s. Six Nations' Bill Isaacs, who drove Hamilton Tigers to a Mann Glass (national senior title) in 1948, was the first superstar of \\"boxla. Bill Isaacs had a lengthy and successful career, playing Senior A for parts of 15 seasons before finally hanging up his stick after the 1949 playoffs. His career included stints with: Burlington, Hamilton-Burlington, Toronto Marlboros, Hamilton Tigers, Mimico-Brampton Combines, and St. Catharines. This was a time in Canadian society when Aboriginal people had few opportunities to participate in mainstream sporting events, which were shaped by both racism and ethnocentric distortion; lacrosse, which was originally created within Aboriginal society, was one activity where Aboriginal athletes could excel and be celebrated in Canada.

She is a key figure in the so-called equality feminism and focused an important part of her research in the building of relations between Enlightenment and feminism. Her book Hacia una crítica de la razón patriarcal constitutes a new outlook on the gender perspective (gender studies) of philosophy, revealing the biases of androcentrism and claims a critical review on behalf of women. She is a professor and member of the Department of Philosophy and Moral and Political Philosophy at the National University of Distance Education, known in Spanish as UNED. Her main research interests are the processes of Enlightenment and its implications for feminism and women in Islam, Human rights and women's rights in the context of multiculturalism. In 2006 she became the first woman to win the National Essay Prize.  Biography  Amorós graduated with a degree in Philosophy from the University of Valencia in 1969 and received the Extraordinary Degree Award in 1970. The title of her thesis was: El concepto de razón dialéctica en Jean Paul Sartre (The Concept of Dialectical Reason of Jean Paul Sartre).

It has been found to be hypomethylated in instances of gastric cancer.  Gene  The gene is located at p13.2 on chromosome 1 in humans and contains 8 exons. It is 11,026 bases long and is oriented on the plus strand. Illustration of genomic context of C1orf162.  mRNA  Three transcript variants have been identified. Isoform 1 is the longest transcript and encodes the longest isoform. Isoform 2 uses an alternate in-frame splice site and is shorter than isoform 1. Isoform 3 lacks an alternate in-frame exon and is shorter compared to isoform 1. There are six stem loops in the 5' untranslated region and five stem loops in the 3' untranslated region. Protein The predicted molecular weight of the protein C1orf162 is 16.9 kdal. Its isoelectric point is approximately 9.2 in mammals. A single transmembrane region is conserved across species. The protein is predicted to localize mainly in the nucleus. The protein is predicted to be myristoylated. Illustration of transmembrane region of C1orf162. Expression C1orf162 is not ubiquitously expressed in humans. According to microarray-assessed tissue expression patterns, C1orf162 is most highly expressed in bone marrow, lung, fetal liver, lymph node, spleen, and thymus in normal human tissues. Staining of normal tissues has found high levels of RNA expression in bone marrow, lymph node, spleen, and lung tissue, which coincides with microarray-assessed expression patterns. Expression of C1orf162 in normal human tissues. Clinical Significance One study found the protein to be one of three hypomethylated proteins in instances of gastric cancer.  Homology  The gene has no known paralogs. Orthologs have been noted in many mammal species in addition to a few birds and reptiles. The transmembrane region of the protein is highly conserved across species. No orthologs have been identified in fish, insects, or prokaryotes.

The small shell is ovate, oblong, smooth and polished. The whitish, somewhat obtuse spire is composed of five or six slightly convex whorls. It is covered with small, ocellated, reddish points, forming an indistinct network. The sutures are surrounded above by a small band of alternating white and red spots, while the lower part is marked by another brown band, sometimes broken by distant white spots. The middle of the body whorl is surrounded by a subcrenulated red band, interrupted by white spots. At the base of the whorl are seen transverse striae, and a small brown band. The aperture is ovate.

He ruled in the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh). The poetic ballads about the Chandelas do not mention Nannuka at all, and instead name \\"Chandravarman\\" as the founder of the Chandela dynasty. However, Nannuka is mentioned as the dynasty's founder in two inscriptions found at Khajuraho, dated Vikrama Samvat 1011 (954 CE) and 1059 (1002 CE). These two inscriptions, eulogistic in nature, do not provide much information of historical value. The 954 CE inscription states that he had conquered many enemies, and that other princes feared and obeyed him. It also states that he was \\"shaped like the god of love\\", and \\"playfully decorated the faces of the women of the quarters with the sandal of his fame\\". The inscription also praises him using vague phrases, such as \\"a touchstone to test the worth of the gold of the regal order\\". The 1002 CE inscription describes him as the Sun and the pearl-jewel of his family. It compares his archery skills to that of the legendary hero Arjuna. It praises his modesty and generosity, and calls him the \\"delight of his subjects\\". The epigraphic records do not mention the circumstances in which the Chandela kingdom was established. The titles given to Nannuka in the Chandela records include nṛpa, narpati and mahīpati. These are not very high titles, and therefore some modern historians believe that he was only a small feudatory ruler. According to the local tradition of Bundelkhand, the Chandelas became rulers of that region after subduing the Pratiharas. Historian R. K. Dikshit notes that, in absence of any historical evidence, it is hard to believe that Nannuka defeated the imperial Pratiharas. He could have overthrown a local branch of the Pratiharas.

He wrote a popular account of the voyage, Les Naufragés, ou Vingt mois sur un récif des îles Auckland which was translated into English as Wrecked on a Reef. The 2003 English edition of Wrecked On A Reef (1869) has additional appendices by French scholar Christiane Mortelier who presents a case for the influence of Raynal's book on Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island. Wrecked On A Reef was very popular at the time of publication, being translated into multiple languages. According to Mortelier, Verne read Raynal's account and loosely based his novel on the true life story of shipwreck, survival, privation, and ultimate rescue.

Itprovides instruction to aircrew on life support equipment, survival and aviation physiology.  History  The Wilbur Rounding Franks building was officially opened in September 1996 as the new home of the Canadian Forces School of Survival and Aeromedical Training. It is located on West Street, 17 Wing and is dedicated to the memory of Group Captain Wilbur Rounding Franks, OBE, CD, in honour of his numerous contributions to the field of aerospace medicine. The ceremony officiated by the Surgeon General, Maj Gen Wendy Arlene Clay, the School Commandant, Maj KC Glass and the Grandson of Dr Franks, Mr Hugh Franks. It is a combination of the Canadian Forces Survival Training School from Edmonton and the amalgamation of three Aeromedical Training units from 426 Squadron Trenton, 404 Squadron Greenwood and Canadian Forces School of Aeromedical Training in Edmonton. The Altitude Chamber Facility was originally designed by Guardite Corporation in September 1954 and was installed in the Chamber Annex in Cold Lake under Contract #446 in 1955. In 1981, it was moved to the Canadian Forces School of Aeromedical Training in Griesbach, Edmonton. The chamber was then moved to 17 Wing, Winnipeg, when the school combined with Canadian Forces Survival School to become the Canadian Forces School Survival and Aeromedical Training, 17 Wing Winnipeg in 1996. The Recompression Chamber was originally installed at Canadian Forces School of Aeromedical Training, Griesbach, CFB Edmonton in 1984, to provide immediate medical assistance to staff and students who suffered altitude induced decompression sickness. The chamber was moved to its current location at 17 Wing Winnipeg in 1996. While in Winnipeg, its use also included several civilian medical cases due to the chambers' unique benefits of hyperbaric medicine. In 2008, the CAF aeromedical program changed its training method and with the risk of decompression sickness being virtually eliminated, the hyperbaric chamber was not required any further. On November 8, 2011, it received approval to cease dive operations, decommission and remove the chamber, with final removal occurring on 24 Jun 2013. SERE Flt is responsible to handle all outdoor survival training. This includes Air Operations Survival - Land (AOS-L), Air Operations Survival - SERE (AOS-SERE) and Air Operations Survival - Arctic (AOS-AA). AOS-L and AOS-SERE are both conducted at Springer Lake, within Nopiming Provincial Park.

Its centerpiece is the Merrick Cottage, built in 1799 by one Hallowell's first colonial settlers, which is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the city. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history Elm Hill Farm is southwest of downtown Hallowell, on the north side of Litchfield Road, a secondary street leading west. It is set on a hill with views toward Vaughan Brook to the south and the Kennebec River to the east. The farm complex includes the main house, several barns, and a garage. The house is a roughly square 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a low-pitch gabled roof and original hand-split wooden clapboard siding. The roof is pierced by gabled dormers, which are a later addition. The interior of the house follows a central hall plan, with two rooms on either side of the center hall. Its main stairs are located off the dining room instead of in the main hall. John Merrick first came to the Hallowell in 1794 as a tutor for the children of Dr. Benjamin Vaughan, one of the area's early settlers. In 1797 he married Vaughan's sister Susan in England, and returned with her to Maine. In 1799 he built this house. He was long active in local civic affairs, particularly education, serving as a trustee of the local academy, and as an overseer of Bowdoin College. The homestead was eventually sold out of the Merrick and Vaughan families, and was repurchased by a descendant in the 20th century.

Once this had been done Henry was reinforced by the Duke of Montpensier who had just secured Western Normandy with the capture of Avranches and with this both men were now ready to take to the field again. The army of Henry numbering in all 25,000 men included a large English contingent of 7,000 men, 3,000 Dutch, and included a large cavalry force, nearly all French. In addition the sea lane towards the Seine was operated and controlled by several Dutch warships in support of Henry's forces. Parma's force took Caudebec with ease and thus set about improving the towns defences. Siege Parma desired to keep the Seine open for supplies and for the ferrying of his troops. Henry saw the opportunity in Parma's strategic blunder. This allowed the Spanish forces to be drawn into a narrow triangle between sea and river of which the Dutch ships were present. Henry had obtained control of the Seine both above and below Caudebec holding Pont de l’Arche, the last bridge across the river between Rouen and Caudebec. On Henry's approach to the town the Catholics forces prepared for a siege, but within a few days with overwhelming numbers the League outerworks were easily overwhelmed leaving the town exposed. During this time Parma received a wound in the arm under the shoulder whilst visiting a gun emplacement; the Duke of Mayenne took over control while Parma convalesced. Every passage was then occupied and strengthened by the King, fierce skirmishes took place everyday, but at length Henry saw all his operations successful, and the army of the League shut in between the river and the sea. Crucially on the third day Henry's force succeeded in cutting off and forcing the surrender of a leaguer division of light cavalry quartered nearby. A large quantity of baggage, food, plate, and money fell into the hands of the Kings men thus placing a difficult situation for Parma's men already in want of provisions. Parma was in a hopeless situation - to cross the river was the only means of retreat; and although Mayenne, and the most experienced officers in the army, pronounced it impracticable, Parma resolved to attempt a retreat. =Parma's escape= The Duke of Parma by Otto van Veen Parma ordered a redoubt thrown up on the closest margin of the river. On the opposite bank he constructed another and planted artillery with a force of eight hundred Flemish soldiers under the Count of Bossu in the one and an equal number of Walloons in the other. He collected all the flatboats, ferries, and rafts that could be found and at Rouen and then under cover of his forts he transported all the Flemish infantry and the Spanish, French, and Italian cavalry during the night of 22 May to the opposite bank of the Seine. At the same time batteries were erected along the banks to keep off the Dutch fleet. The next morning he sent up all the artillery together with the Flemish cavalry to Rouen making use of what he could of the broken arches of the destroyed bridge in order to shorten the distance from shore to shore. With this he managed to convey his whole army with all its trains across the river. A force was left behind up to the last moment to engage in skirmishes and to display themselves as largely as possible for the purpose of distracting the King's force. The young Prince of Parma Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma had command of this rearguard and the escape was successful. The news of this operation was not brought to Henry's attention until after it had been accomplished. When the king reached the shore of the Seine he saw that the rearguard of the army including the garrison of the fort on the right bank were just ferrying themselves across under command of Banuccio. Shocked by this Henry quickly ordered artillery to bear upon the withdrawing soldiers but the bombardment was largely ineffective and the Catholic Spanish force took up their line of march to the south. Henry then constructed a bridge over the Pont de l'Arche and his first objective was to pursue with his cavalry but it was too late; the infantry would not have been able to support them in time. Aftermath Parma's withdrawal was complete, but he had to abandon his transport with the sick and wounded. Having escaped from Henry's army, Parma's force then marched eastward at speed reaching Saint Cloud within five days. The Duke afterwards reinforced the garrison in Paris before returning to Flanders. Even though Henry had been fooled by Parma, the victory did lay with him strategically since Parma had retreated before him and Caudebec was back in the hands of the King. At the same time Henry's opportunity to destroy the Spanish and Catholic army had been missed. Parma had escaped to Flanders but the Spanish court on the view of his retreat meant that he had fallen foul with them and was removed from the position as governor. On 2 December Parma died at Arras, the wound from the battle having proved fatal. A League and Spanish force defeated an Anglo-Royal army at Craon on 21 May but elsewhere they were less successful. By Winter of that year Henry gave up campaigning but for him at least and the Protestant army Parma was no longer a serious threat. In December Henry disbanded his army but was no closer to recapturing his kingdom.

During the Great Depression he painted murals in the same style for the Public Works of Art Project and the Federal Art Project. Art training The son of Italian immigrants, Daniel Celentano was born into a large family within an Italian neighborhood of Manhattan. A childhood polio attack left him with only partial use of his right leg. Made homebound by this disability he was unable to attend school and, recognizing his artistic skill while he was still a boy, his parents were able to arrange for art teachers to tutor him at home. Through hard work and perseverance he regained control over his leg by the age of twelve and at that time became the first pupil of the social realist painter Thomas Hart Benton. In 1918 he won scholarships that enabled him to attend Charles Hawthorne's Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts, New York School of Fine And Applied Art in Greenwich Village, and the National Academy of Design in New York's Upper East Side. The Cape Cod School taught students during the summer months and the other two gave classes during the rest of the year. Artistic career Daniel Celentano, \\"Supper Hour,\\" pen and ink wash on light cream wove card stock, circa 1930, 11 x 14 inches (280 x 355 mm.) Daniel Celentano, \\"Festival,\\" 1934, oil on canvas mounted on fiberboard, 48⅛ x 60⅛, (122.3 x 152.8 cm.), Smithsonian American Art Museum Transfer from the U.S. Department of Labor, created for the Public Works of Art Project of the United States Government. This painting is also called \\"Festa di Monte Carmela.\\" It was included in an exhibition called \\"1934: A New Deal for Artists,\\" in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. During the 1930s and until the outbreak of World War II Celentano participated in group shows at galleries in New York, Detroit, Philadelphia, and other American cities. His work was first shown to the public in an exhibition of works selected by Alfred Stieglitz that was held at the Opportunity Gallery in 1930. In his review of this show the art critic for the New York Times, Edward Alden Jewell, included a painting of Celentano's called \\"Funeral\\" among ones that he especially recommended. Celentano's drawing, \\"Supper Hour,\\" is an early work that is typical in subject and treatment of much that he produced later in his career. It shows a family of eight in a kitchen getting ready to share an evening meal together. From their attitudes and actions it appears that they spend much of their home life in this one room. Although crowded together, they appear to be relaxed and self-assured. His painting, \\"Festival,\\" of a few years later, shows the boisterous community of East Harlem in holiday mode. The Smithsonian's exhibition label says, \\"This painting fairly bursts with the raucous sounds, pungent smells, and vibrant characters of Manhattan's ethnic street life.\\" Between 1935 and 1939 Celentano exhibited regularly at the Walker Gallery. In 1939 his first, and apparently his only one-man show took place there. Of this show a critic for the New York Sun said \\"He paints the humble domestic life that he knows with a frankness as to its happenings, a sympathy and a tireless eye for detail that command respect, if not enthusiasm. The curious may learn all about that life from his paintings without going to the trouble of doing settlement work or running the slightest risk of getting out of their class.\\" His shows at the Walker Gallery produced institutional sales to the Carnegie Institute, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Whitney Museum. Between 1935 and the outbreak of World War II Celentano participated in group exhibitions held in museums and public collections in New York and other major cities, including the Brooklyn Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, the Pennsylvania Academy, the Whitney Museum, and the Golden Gate International Exposition. From 1934 to 1941 Celentano was employed as a mural painter in federal art projects. During the short lifetime of the Federal Works of Art Project he helped William C. Palmer paint murals for the new Queens General Hospital in Jamaica. In 1936 he painted a mural called \\"Commerce\\" for the Flushing branch of the Queens Borough Public Library A critic for the New York Times pointed out this mural's \\"realistic illustrational\\" style noting that it depicted \\"rural fields and the Manhattan skyline, with crowds of dock loaders and businessmen flanking the central image of an artist (possibly Celentano himself) sitting at a drafting table, a worker among workers.\\" In 1938, commissioned by the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture, he made a mural called The Country Store and Post Office for the U.S. Post Office in Vidalia, Georgia. He also made murals for two high schools, Andrew Jackson (1940) and St. Albans (1941), both in Queens. In 1940 he painted a large mural called \\"Children in Constructive Recreation and Cultural Activity\\" in Public School 150 (Long Island City, Queens). After the United States entered World War II he took a job in the art department of the Grumman Aircraft Corporation in Bethpage, Long Island where he made a mural called \\"The Flight of Man.\\" Parents and immediate family Both of his parents had been born in Italy, his father, Vito, about 1879, and his mother, Maria, about 1880. Celentano was the second of their eleven children who survived infancy. During the years when Celentano was studying art and for much of the rest of his life, he and his family lived on Pleasant Avenue in East Harlem. He was schooled at home until, as a teenager, he overcame the atrophy of his right leg. In 1928 he married Marie Steneck. In 1930, Celentano's wife gave birth to a daughter. Celentano married a second time to Margaret Mary Dwyer on June 24, 1945 in Astoria, Queens. Their son Daniel Michael Celentano was born in November 1946. Celentano and his wife eventually moved to St. James, Long Island, where he died of cancer in 1980. =Other names= Celentano was known as Daniel R.

The parallel operator (also known as reduced sum, parallel sum or parallel addition) \\\\ (pronounced \\"parallel\\", following the parallel lines notation from geometry) is a mathematical function which is used as a shorthand in electrical engineering, but is also used in kinetics, fluid mechanics and financial mathematics. Overview The parallel operator represents the reciprocal value of a sum of reciprocal values (sometimes also referred to as \\"reciprocal formula\\") and is defined by: :\\\\begin{align} {}\\\\parallel{}: &&\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\times \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}} &\\\\to \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}}  &&(a, b) &\\\\mapsto a \\\\parallel b = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{1}{b}} = \\\\frac{ab}{a + b}, \\\\end{align} with \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}} = \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty\\\\\\\\} being the extended complex numbers (with corresponding rules). The later form is sometimes also referred to as \\"product over sum\\". The operator gives half of the harmonic mean of two numbers a and b. As a special case, for a \\\\in \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}}: :a \\\\parallel a = \\\\frac{a}{2}. Further, for all a,b \\\\in \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}}: :a eq b \\\\iff \\\\big a \\\\parallel b \\\\big > \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\min(a, b) with \\\\big a \\\\parallel b \\\\big representing the absolute value of a \\\\parallel b. With a and b being positive real numbers follows \\\\big a \\\\parallel b \\\\big < \\\\min(a, b). The concept has been extended from a scalar operation to matrices and further generalized. Notation The operator was originally introduced as reduced sum by Sundaram Seshu in 1956, studied as operator \`∗\` by Kent E. Erickson in 1959, and popularized by Richard James Duffin and William Niles Anderson, Jr. as parallel addition or parallel sum operator \`:\` in mathematics and network theory since 1966. While some authors continue to use this symbol up to the present, for example, Sujit Kumar Mitra used \`∙\` as a symbol in 1970. In applied electronics, a \`∥\` sign became more common as the operator's symbol later on. This was often written as doubled vertical line () available in most character sets, but now can be represented using Unicode character U+2225 ( ∥ ) for \\"parallel to\\". In LaTeX and related markup languages, the macros \`\\\\\` and \`\\\\parallel\` are often used to denote the operator's symbol. Rules For addition, the parallel operator follows the commutative law: :a \\\\parallel b = b \\\\parallel a and the associative law: :(a \\\\parallel b) \\\\parallel c = a \\\\parallel (b \\\\parallel c) = a \\\\parallel b \\\\parallel c = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{1}{b} + \\\\frac{1}{c}} = \\\\frac{a b c}{a b + a c + b c} Multiplication is distributive over this operation. Further, the parallel operator has \\\\infty as neutral element and, for a \\\\in \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, the number -a as inverse element. However, \\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}}, \\\\parallel\\\\right) is not an abelian group, as a \\\\parallel 0 = 0 for every nonzero , and 0 \\\\parallel 0 is not well defined (indeterminate form). In the absence of parentheses, the parallel operator is defined as taking precedence over addition or subtraction. Applications In electrical engineering, the parallel operator can be used to calculate the total impedance of various serial and parallel electrical circuits. For instance, the total resistance of resistors connected in parallel is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistors. :A diagram of several resistors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires. :\\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\text{eq}} = \\\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\\\frac{1}{R_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{R_n}. Likewise for the total capacitance of serial capacitors. The same principle can be applied to various problems in other disciplines. There is a duality between the usual (series) sum and the parallel sum. Examples Question: : Three resistors R_1 = 270\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega}, R_2 = 180\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega} and R_3 = 120\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega} are connected in parallel. What is their resulting resistance? Answer: : R_1 \\\\parallel R_2 \\\\parallel R_3 = 270\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega} \\\\parallel 180\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega} \\\\parallel 120\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{270\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega}} + \\\\frac{1}{180\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega}} + \\\\frac{1}{120\\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega}}} \\\\approx 56.84 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{k\\\\Omega} : The effectively resulting resistance is ca. 57 kΩ. Question: : A construction worker raises a wall in 5 hours. Another worker would need 7 hours for the same work. How long does it take to build the wall if both worker work in parallel? Answer: : t_1 \\\\parallel t_2 = 5\\\\,\\\\mathrm h \\\\parallel 7\\\\,\\\\mathrm h = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{5\\\\,\\\\mathrm h} + \\\\frac{1}{7\\\\,\\\\mathrm h}} \\\\approx 2.92\\\\,\\\\mathrm h : They will finish in close to 3 hours. Implementation WP 34S with parallel operator (\`∥\`) on the key. Suggested already by Kent E. Erickson as a subroutine in digital computers in 1959, the parallel operator is implemented as a keyboard operator on the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) scientific calculators WP 34S since 2008 as well as on the WP 34C and WP 43S since 2015, allowing to solve even cascaded problems with few keystrokes like .

Bruno was appointed to succeed Bishop Amelung, brother of Herman Billung, in 962. Bruno is best known for his refusal to allow the burial in church of Herman due to his excommunication. Bruno received immunity for the diocese by Emperor Otto I. According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Herman's son Bernard, while transporting his father's body to Lüneburg, encountered Bruno and tearfully asked that his father be granted absolution and permitted burial at the church. Bruno refused. Bruno was held in high regard by the emperor who had designated him successor to Amelung. Because stone was not available, Amelung had erected and consecrated a magnificent wooden church, surpassing all others in size and quality. Archaeological evidence confirms the description of this church. As Bruno grew old, Emperor Otto II asked that his chaplain Herman, brother of Folkmar (Volkmar), Archbishop of Cologne, be designated as assistant and heir.

It was their 28th consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after their promotion the season 1945–46. They played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium.  Overview  Helmut Benthaus was first team manager. This was his ninth season as manager. To the beginning of the season Urs Siegenthaler moved on to play for Xamax and Rolf Riner left to play for Servette. In the other direction Rudolf Wampfler joined from Sion, Arthur von Wartburg joined from Concordia Basel and Roland Paolucci returned from his loan to Winterthur. But the most notorious transfer was that of Teófilo Cubillas from Alianza Lima. The Basler entrepreneur and transport company owner Ruedi Reisdorfer paid the transfer fee of £97,000. Cubillas scored two goals for Basel in the 1973–74 European Cup, the first of which in the 1st leg against Fram on 19 September 1973 and the second in the return leg on 20 September. He only remained at the club for six months, which was not long enough for him to show the extent of his talent. Later on, for the second half of the 1973–74 season he joined Portuguese club Porto for a fee of £200,000. Basel played a total of 54 games in their 1973–74 season. 26 in the domestic league, four in the Swiss Cup, one in the Swiss League Cup, six in the European Cup and 17 were friendly matches. The team scored a total of 143 goals and conceded 91. The Nationalliga A season 1973–74 was contested under 14 teams. These were the top 12 teams from the previous 1972–73 season and the two newly promoted teams Xamax and Chênois. The championship was played in a double round robin. The champions would qualify for the 1974–75 European Cup, the second and third placed teams were to qualifiy for 1974–75 UEFA Cup and the last two teams in the table at the end of the season were to be relegated. Zürich won the championship 12 points ahead of Grasshopper Club, 13 ahead of the Servette and FC Winterthur. Basel finished in fifth position and were 16 points behind the new champions. Basel won 13 of their 26 league games, drew three and lost ten games. They scored a total of 57 goals conceding 39. La Chaux-de-Fonds and Chiasso suffered relegation. Basel's stricker Ottmar Hitzfeld was joint leagues top goal scorer with Ove Grahn of Lausanne-Sports both scored 18 league goals. Basels second top scorer was Walter Mundschin with seven goals, René Hasler and Karl Odermatt each scored six goals, Walter Balmer managed five and Teófilo Cubillas scored three league goals. Basel's highest scoring game was in the 24th round on 8 May 1974 as they sent Lausanne-Sports home with an 8–2 package from the St. Jakob Stadium. Karl Odermatt scored the first two goals in the 5th and the 11th minute, Ottmar Hitzfeld added the next two in the 15th and 17th minute before Walter Mundschin added the next two in the 20th and 25th Minute to make it six goals in 25 minutes. A penalty goal by Müller pulled one back for Lausanne-Sport, but despite this Basel led 6–1 at half time. Hitzfeld scored his personal third goal in the 57th minute and in the 75th Markus Tanner netted the final goal of the game. Roger Piccand had scored Lausannes second in the 71st minute. In the Swiss Cup Basel played the round of 32 on 22 September 1973 away against Biel-Bienne in the Gurzelen Stadion and won 2–1. In the round of 16 on 6 October 1973 they played away again against Mendrisiostar and won 4–1. In this game Cubillas scored two goals. The quarter-final was a two legged fixtures. The first leg played on 31 October 1973 in Stade Tourbillon was a 1–0 defeat against Sion. The second leg played on 4 November 1973 in the St. Jakob Stadium ended in a 2–2 draw, thus Sion won 3–2 on aggregate. In the 1973 Swiss League Cup Basel were drawn with an away game against Neuchâtel Xamax in the first round and were eliminated. As reigning Swiss Champions, Basel were qualified for the 1973–74 European Cup. In the first round, drawn against Iceland's champions Fram, Basel won with the aggregate score 11–2. In the second round they were drawn against Club Brugge. In the exiting second leg Basel won 6–4 and thus 7–6 on aggregate. In the quarter-final Basel won the first leg against Celtic 3–2 and in the second leg Celtic won by the same score. During extra time Scottish international Steve Murray scored the decisive goal in the 114th minute. Celtic continued to the semi-final but did not reach the final.

A member of Labour and Co-operative parties, she has been the Member of the London Assembly (AM) for Lambeth and Southwark since 2016. From 2006 to 2018, she was a local councillor, representing the Brixton Hill ward on Lambeth London Borough Council. Early life Born Florence Nosegbe,https://www.themj.co.uk/40-under-40--Revisited/211820 she is a lifelong Brixton resident and the eldest of three girls from a single parent family. Her mother worked as a school teacher until her illness forced her to retire early. She supported her mother, who suffered from sickle cell anaemia and kidney failure, as her carer. Eshalomi attended local schools in Lambeth including Durand Primary (now Van Gogh) and St Helen's RC Primary school and Bishop Thomas Grant Secondary School. She completed her A-Levels at St Francis Xavier Sixth Form College in Clapham South. She is the first member of her family to go to university, graduating with a BA Hons in Political & International Studies with Law from Middlesex University. Florence benefited from the EU Funded 'Erasmus Student Exchange' and had the opportunity to study at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Eshalomi started her working life as a 16-year-old at Sainsbury's supermarket, Clapham High Street. She has worked in a variety of campaigning and public affairs roles including in local government as a policy officer, as a regional organiser for the Labour Party during the 2005 general election and as the Public Affairs Manager for the UK's leading race equality think tank, the Runnymede Trust. Political career Prior to winning her seat in the Assembly, she worked for the PR agency Four Communications as a public affairs account manager. Eshalomi served as a local councillor from Brixton Hill on Lambeth London Borough Council. She represented the ward along with future Labour MP Steve Reed. Eshalomi has previously served as a member of the Progress Strategy Board. In 2016, The Times reported that \\"one of Momentum's most militant factions\\" planned to picket an event held to support Eshalomi's candidacy for the London Assembly. MPs including Chuka Umunna, Ben Bradshaw and Stella Creasy strongly criticised the picket, and a spokesperson for Momentum stated that the picket was organised by a separate group and that \\"Momentum are fully behind Flo's campaign.\\" In the 2015 leadership election Eshalomi supported Liz Kendall to become Labour Party leader. Eshalomi was elected to the London Assembly on 5 May 2016 with a majority of 62,243 over the Conservative Party candidate Robert Flint. She is lead spokesperson for the London Assembly Labour Group on Transport issues, and current Chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee. As an Assembly Member, Eshalomi has campaigned on issues including gang crime and the closure of Kennington Police Station. Eshalomi was selected as Labour candidate for the Vauxhall parliamentary constituency on 27 October 2019, after Kate Hoey, a long-standing MP of 30 years, had announced she would not stand again as Labour's candidate in the constituency. She won the seat with a slightly reduced but still strong Labour majority of 19,612 votes. Eshalomi made her maiden speech in the House of Commons on 17 January 2020. She said that \\"I never imagined that almost five years to the day, as I was literally pacing up and down the maternity ward, looking over the river, trying to coerce my daughter to come out, I would now be sat in this Parliament fighting for funding for our hard-working doctors and nurses\\" in reference to St Thomas' Hospital in her Vauxhall constituency. Eshalomi also prioritised more funding for the NHS and Police and to focus on tackling youth violence and young women facing sexual exploitation. Eshalomi and her fellow black female MPs have frequently been mistaken for each other since entering parliament, with Eshalomi herself being twice mistaken for black female colleagues in the nine months since her election. Eshalomi said of the misidentifications that \\"The frequency is worrying and lends itself to a lazy racist view that all black people look the same\\". Eshalomi was wrongly identified as Taiwo Owatemi by BBC Parliament and a fellow MP ran up to her thinking she was Kate Osamor. During Eshalomi's time on the London Assembly she was mistaken for Kemi Badenoch, then a fellow assembly member. Eshalomi wrote that \\"All those women I've referenced are individual politicians in their own right...They're women who fought to get elected. So they deserve to be named and not to be confused with other black women. This doesn't happen to some of my white female colleagues, who sometimes have their hair down, sometimes they'll have it back in a ponytail. So why is it, if we as black women change our hair or our appearance, you can't recognise us?\\". Personal life Eshalomi is married to Matthew and they have two children, Mia and Malachi, who were both born locally at St Thomas' Hospital. Eshalomi attends Our Lady of the Rosary Church, Brixton.

Part of Cariamiformes, its closest living relatives are seriemas, though it differs significantly from them, being a better flyer. Classification Since its original description Elaphrocnemus has been regarded as a cariamiform bird. It was referred to the family Orthocnemidae, since them absorbed into Idiornithidae.Joel Cracraft 1973Cécile MOURER- CHAUVIRÉ, LES GRUIFORMES (A VES) DES PHOSPHORITES DU QUERCY (FRANCE). 1. SOUS- ORDRE CARIAMAE (CARIAMIDAE ET PHORUSRHACIDAE). SYSTÉMATIQUE ET BIOSTRATIGRAPHIE. However, relationships within Cariamiformes are unresolved, as several studies render Idiornithidae as polyphyletic, with Elaphrocnemus recovered away from other \\"idiornithids\\", outside of the clade leading to them and modern seriemas. Some authorities renders the genus a synonym of Talantatos, though some recent studies recover it as independent from this genus. A possibly closely related species, Itaboravis, is known from the Paleocene of Brazil. Flight capacities Unlike its poorly-flighted modern seriema relatives, and the several flightless extinct Cariamiformes like phorusrhacids and bathornithids, Elaphrocnemus appears to have been a good flyer. It possesses long scapulas, convergent in shape to those of pelicans, and although its furcula was as weakly developed as that of modern seriemas and their flightless relatives it had proportionally large and strong wing bone elements.Gerald Mayr & Cécile Mourer-Chauviré, The peculiar scapula of the late Eocene Elaphrocnemus phasianus Milne-Edwards, 1892 (Aves, Cariamae), December 2008, Volume 88, Issue 2, pp 195-198 Likewise, its legs were also shorter than those of other Cariamiformes, implying a less cursorial lifestyle. Because Caramiformes had a more or less global distribution across the Paleogene, the flight capacities of Elaphrocnemus and kin might be of extreme relevance to the biogeographical distribution of the clade. Palaeoecology Elaphrocnemus is one of the most common birds in sites like the Quercy Formation, perhaps indicating agglomeration in large flocks. The local climate was subtropical in nature, producing a rich rainforest ecosystem that included a large variety of mammal and bird species.

In this model, pain only DCS is modelled by a single tissue which is diffusion-limited for gas uptake and bubble-formation during decompression causes \\"phase equilibration\\" of partial pressures between dissolved and free gases. The driving mechanism for gas elimination in this tissue is inherent unsaturation, also called partial pressure vacancy or the oxygen window, where oxygen metabolised is replaced by more soluble carbon dioxide. This model was used to explain the effectiveness of the Torres Straits Island pearl divers empirically developed decompression schedules, which used deeper decompression stops and less overall decompression time than the current naval decompression schedules. This trend to deeper decompression stops has become a feature of more recent decompression models. Concept Brian A. Hills analysed the existing decompression hypotheses frequently referenced in the literature of the time, and identified three basic characteristics of comprehensive theoretical approaches to modeling decompression: # The number and composition of tissues involved; # A mechanism and controlling parameters for onset of identifiable symptoms; # A mathematical model for gas transport and distribution. Hills found no evidence of discontinuity in the incidence of decompression symptoms for exposure/depth variations, which he interpreted as suggesting that either a single critical tissue or a continuous range of tissues are involved, and that correlation was not improved by assuming an infinite range of half times in a conventional exponential model. After later experimental work he concluded that the imminence of decompression sickness is more likely to be indicated by the quantity of gas separating from solution (the critical volume hypothesis) than its mere presence (as determined by a critical limit to supersaturation) and suggested that this implies that conventional (Haldanian) schedules are actually treating an asymptomatic gas phase in the tissues and not preventing the separation of gas from solution. Efficient decompression will minimize the total ascent time while limiting the total accumulation of bubbles to an acceptable non-symptomatic critical value. The physics and physiology of bubble growth and elimination indicate that it is more efficient to eliminate bubbles while they are very small. Models which include bubble phase have produced decompression profiles with slower ascents and deeper initial decompression stops as a way of curtailing bubble growth and facilitating early elimination, in comparison with the models which consider only dissolved phase gas. According to the thermodynamic model, the condition of optimum driving force for outgassing is satisfied when the ambient pressure is just sufficient to prevent phase separation (bubble formation). The fundamental difference of this approach is equating absolute ambient pressure with the total of the partial gas tensions in the tissue for each gas after decompression as the limiting point beyond which bubble formation is expected. The model assumes that the natural unsaturation in the tissues due to metabolic reduction in oxygen partial pressure provides the buffer against bubble formation, and that the tissue may be safely decompressed provided that the reduction in ambient pressure does not exceed this unsaturation value. Clearly any method which increases the unsaturation would allow faster decompression, as the concentration gradient would be greater without risk of bubble formation. The natural unsaturation, an effect variously known as the oxygen window, partial pressure vacancy and inherent unsaturation, increases with depth, so a larger ambient pressure differential is possible at greater depth, and reduces as the diver surfaces. This model leads to slower ascent rates and deeper first stops, but shorter shallow stops, as there is less bubble phase gas to be eliminated. Natural unsaturation also increases with increase in partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas. The thermodynamic model is based on the following assumptions: *Only one type of tissue is considered, which is the first type to present symptoms of decompression sickness. Other, non-symptomatic, tissues are disregarded as they do not present a problem. *The formation of bubble nuclei occurs randomly within the tissues, and at various levels of supersaturation. *Once a bubble nucleus has formed within a supersaturated tissue, dissolved gas in the tissue will diffuse through the bubble surface until equilibrium is reached between pressure in the bubble and concentration in the adjacent tissue. *Phase equilibration occurs within a few minutes. *Once bubbles have formed they have a tendency to coalesce, causing pressure on the tissues and nerves, which will eventually cause pain. *Once bubbles have formed, they are only eliminated by diffusion due to inherent unsaturation. The requirement to maintain an ambient pressure high enough to prevent bubble growth leads to a significantly deeper first stop than the dissolved phase models which assume that bubbles do not form during asymptomatic decompression. This model was a radical change from the traditional dissolved phase models. Hills was met with considerable skepticism and after several years of advocating two-phase models, eventually turned to other fields of research. Eventually, the work of other researchers provided enough impact to gain widespread acceptance for bubble models, and the value of Hills' research was recognised. Further development The bubble models of decompression are a logical development from this model. The critical-volume criterion assumes that whenever the total volume of gas phase accumulated in the tissues exceeds a critical value, signs or symptoms of DCS will appear. This assumption is supported by doppler bubble detection surveys. The consequences of this approach depend strongly on the bubble formation and growth model used, primarily whether bubble formation is practicably avoidable during decompression. This approach is used in decompression models which assume that during practical decompression profiles, there will be growth of stable microscopic bubble nuclei which always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. =Varying Permeability Model= The Varying Permeability Model (VPM) is a decompression algorithm developed by D.E. Yount and others for use in professional and recreational diving. It was developed to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure. The VPM presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in water and tissues that contain water. Any nuclei larger than a specific \\"critical\\" size, which is related to the maximum dive depth will grow during decompression. The VPM aims to minimize the total volume of these growing bubbles by keeping the external pressure relatively large, and the inspired inert gas partial pressures low during decompression. =Reduced Gradient Bubble Model= The reduced gradient bubble model (RGBM) is a decompression algorithm developed by Dr Bruce Wienke. It is related to the Varying Permeability Model. but is conceptually different in that it rejects the gel-bubble model of the varying permeability model. – Bruce Wienke describes the differences between RGBM and VPM It is used in several dive computers, particularly those made by Suunto, Aqwary, Mares, HydroSpace Engineering, and Underwater Technologies Center. It is characterised by the following assumptions: blood flow (perfusion) provides a limit for tissue gas penetration by diffusion; an exponential distribution of sizes of bubble seeds is always present, with many more small seeds than large ones; bubbles are permeable to gas transfer across surface boundaries under all pressures; the haldanean tissue compartments range in half time from 1 to 720 minutes, depending on gas mixture.

FastHorse grew up in South Dakota, where she began her career as a ballet dancer and choreographer but was forced into an early retirement after ten years of dancing due to an injury. Returning to an early interest in writing, she became involved in Native American drama, especially the Native American film community. Later she began writing and directing her own plays, several of which are published through Samuel French (a Concord Theatricals Company) and Dramatic Publishing. With playwright and performer Ty Defoe, FastHorse co-founded Indigenous Direction, a \\"a consulting firm that helps organizations and individuals who want to create accurate work by, for and with Indigenous peoples.\\" Indigenous Direction's clients include the Guthrie Theater. FastHorse is the vice chair of the Theatre Communications Group, which is the national organization for the American theatre that offers its members networking and knowledge-building opportunities through conferences, events, research, and communications.  Career  FastHorse was a delegate in 2000 to the United Nations in Geneva, where she spoke on the power film can have for Indigenous peoples. FastHorse then chose to broaden her experience and shifted from a career as a dancer and choreographer, to feature television and film development. FastHorse worked for Universal Pictures before joining Latham Entertainment at Paramount as a creative executive; she produced two short films, The Migration and A Final Wish, before again switching focus, this time from television and film production to writing and directing. While writing and working on many projects of her own making, FastHorse also served as a panelist for The Film and Video Fellowships which was formerly named the Rockefeller Fellowship. In addition to the Film and Video Fellowships, she has been involved with many other networks and theatre companies: she has written commissioned pieces for the Alter Theatre in San Rafael, CA; Cornerstone Theatre Company; and Native Voices at the Autry both located in Los Angeles, CA, as well as the Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis, MN; the Kennedy Center for Young Audiences in Washington, D.C.; and for Mountainside Theater in Cherokee, N.C. She has developed new plays with the Arizona Theatre Company, Tucson, AZ; the Center Theatre Group Writer's Workshop, Los Angeles, CA; and Berkeley Rep's Ground Floor, Berkeley, CA. Her play Urban Rez, created with Cornerstone Theater, portrays the experience of Indigenous people in Los Angeles County, home to the U.S.'s second-largest Indigenous population. The Thanksgiving Play was begun with a fellowship from the Guthrie Theater and developed through readings including at DC's Center Stage Play Lab in 2016; it was produced by Artists Repertory Theatre in Oregon in April 2018. Both The Thanksgiving Play in 2017 and What Would Crazy Horse Do? in 2014 were featured on the annual \\"Kilroys' List\\" of \\"recommended un- and underproduced new plays by female and trans authors of color.\\" What Would Crazy Horse Do?, a comedy inspired by historical interest by the KKK in collaborations with Indigenous groups, was featured in the Lilly Awards' 2015 reading series with performers Emily Bergl, Jesse Perez, and Madeline Sayet. The Thanksgiving Play also secured FastHorse's off-Broadway playwright debut, with an October 2018 production announced by Playwrights Horizons, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel and starring Margo Seibert, Jennifer Bareilles, Jeffrey Bean, and Greg Keller. As part of her production contract as a playwright, FastHorse requires that the theatre hire at least one other Indigenous artist for the production, and showcase at least one other Indigenous artist's work in the building.

They may have accounts giving them legitimate access to computer systems, with this access originally having been given to them to serve in the performance of their duties; these permissions could be abused to harm the organization. Insiders are often familiar with the organization's data and intellectual property as well as the methods that are in place to protect them. This makes it easier for the insider to circumvent any security controls of which they are aware. Physical proximity to data means that the insider does not need to hack into the organizational network through the outer perimeter by traversing firewalls; rather they are in the building already, often with direct access to the organization's internal network. Insider threats are harder to defend against than attacks from outsiders since the insider already has legitimate access to the organization's information and assets. Insiders may comprise permanent and temporary employees, vendors, contractors, suppliers, or ex-employees. Most common insiders are those that have elevated access where they can utilize sensitive information without drawing suspicion. However, anyone can be an insider threat to an organization if they do not dispose, secure, utilize sensitive information described in an agency's regulations. There have been cases where individuals are compromised by an opposing agency and exploited by the individual's financial status, threats on their life, or other factors in order to force the individual to comply with the opposing agencies demands. Criminal activity An insider may attempt to steal property or information for personal gain, or to benefit another organization or country. These attacks may range from information data being stolen to the destruction of business property. Insiders may perform the following threats against their organization: * Espionage, criminal enterprise, fraud, theft and unauthorized disclosure of information (Classified information, sensitive information, intellectual property, trade secrets, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) ) * Information technology sabotage * Any action that results in the loss or degradation of organization resources or capabilities and its ability to accomplish its mission or business function. * Acts of terrorism Common insider identifiers Insiders have similar characteristics that can be compiled to in order to help determine possible threats. Most researchers have identified that insiders mainly show antisocial behavior that may include but not limited to: Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy. On the information system side, there is the list of common behavioral indicators of known insiders: * Downloading substantial amounts of data to external drives * Accessing confidential data that is not relevant to a user's role * Emailing sensitive information to a personal account * Attempts to bypass security controls * Requests for clearance or higher-level access without need; *Frequently accessing the workspace outside of normal working hours; *Irresponsible social media behaviors; *Maintaining access to sensitive data after termination; *Using unauthorized external storage devices; *Visible disgruntlement toward employers or co-workers; *Chronic violation of organization policies; *Decline in work performance; *Use of mobile devices to photograph or otherwise record computer screens, common work areas or data centers; *Excessive use of printers and scanners; *Electronic communications containing excessive use of negative language; *Installing unapproved software; *Communication with high-risk current or former employees; *Traveling to countries known for intellectual property (IP) theft or hosting competitors; *Violation of corporate policies; *Network crawling, data hoarding or copying from internal repositories; *Anomalies in work hours; *Attempts to access restricted areas; *Indications of living beyond one's means * Discussions of resigning or new business ventures; and * Complaints of hostile, abnormal, unethical or illegal behaviors Examples of insider threats The impacts from insider threat incidents can be very severe, costly and damaging. Not all incidents by insiders are malicious. Non-Malicious insider incidents can be just as damaging as malicious incidents.

Marks is Jewish and both his parents were Holocaust survivors. His father Peter grew up in Prostějov, Czechoslovakia. Marks’s paternal grandparents and aunt were killed in Auschwitz, but his father was able to escape to Palestine (which later became Israel) with the help of an uncle, Francis Huber. Marks’s father immigrated to the United States in his early 20s, and died in 2010. Marks’s mother, Eve, escaped Austria with her parents during the Holocaust and immigrated to the United States in 1938, when she was 11 years old. She died in 1973.

He holds a degree in speech and voice pathology from Montclair State College (now Montclair State University). He has one sister, Lauren, and since 1981 he has been married to Elayne Marks. They have two daughters, Erica and Arielle, and five grandchildren.  Career  Marks opened a studio in New York City in 1977, shortly after being hired as a pianist for the original Broadway production of the musical Annie. At the time, many vocal coaches believed that young performers should not study voice, so Marks began teaching with a focus on training young singers and actors. He is now considered a leading vocal coach for performers of all ages and has been featured in articles from Read Periodicals and The Daily Beast. Additionally, he is a regular guest blogger on BroadwayWorld, where he writes a column about vocal training.

Their territory included north-western parts of Central India (present-day Madhya Pradesh).  History  The Sanskrit word Kachchhapa-ghata (कच्छपघात) literally means \\"tortoise killer\\". was a Rajput dynasty of Central India's Chmbal-Gwalior region. The Kachchhapaghatas were originally the vassals of the Pratihara Rajput rulers and the Chandela rajput rulers. After the death of the Chandela king Vidyadhara, the Chandela kingdom was weakened by repeated Muslim (Yamini) invasions. Taking advantage of this situation, the Kachchhapaghatas gave up their allegiance to the Chandelas. They became powerful towards the end of the 10th century and were considered great builders and architects. A Sasbahu temple inscription suggests that Lakshmana was the first prominent member of the dynasty. This inscription, as well as a 977 Sihoniya inscription state that his successor Vajradaman captured Gopadri (Gwalior) from the king of Gadhinagara, that is the Pratihara ruler of Kannauj. Vajradaman, described as the tilaka of the dynasty in Gwalior inscriptions dated 1093-94 and 1104, was probably the first powerful ruler of the dynasty. He served as a feudatory to the Chandela kings Dhanga and Vidyadhara. The dynasty was divided into three branches, which ruled from Gwalior (Gopādrigiri), Dubkunda (Chaṇdobha), and Narwar (Nalapur). Virasimha (also Virasimharama or Virasimhadeva), a Kachchhapaghata ruler of Nalapura, issued a copper plate grant in 1120-21. This record describes him using the high-status royal title Maharajadhiraja a sovereign title, depicting that he attained a sovereign status. Gold coins issued by him have also been discovered. = Downfall = According to bardic tradition, the last ruler of the dynasty was Tejaskarana (alias Dulha Rai or Dhola Rai), the hero of the romantic tale Dhola Maru. This account states that he left Gwalior in 1128 to marry the daughter of a neighbouring ruler, after leaving Paramal-dev (or Paramardi-dev) in-charge of the Gwalior fort. When he returned to Gwalior, Paramal refused to hand over the fort to him, and founded the Parihara dynasty which ruled Gwalior for 103 years. The Parihara ruler over Gwalior is also attested the 1150 inscription of Ramdeo and 1194 inscription of Lohanga-Deva. However, other inscriptions suggest that the Kachchhapaghatas ruled the area at least until 1155 CE. In addition, 1192 and 1194 inscriptions found at Gwalior show that the Kachchhapaghata ruler Ajayapala controlled Gwalior in the later years as well. Thus, the bardic account is not completely reliable, and the Parihara chiefs probably ruled Gwalior as feudatories of the Kachchhapaghatas. Sulakshanapala, the last ruler of the dynasty, appears to have lost his kingdom to a Ghurid invasion. The Tajul-Ma'asir suggests the Ghurid general Qutb al-Din Aibak invaded Gwalior in 1196, and extracted tribute from Sulakshanapala (whom Tajul-Ma'asir labels Solankhapala of Parihar family). The invaders took over the fort in the later years. The bardic accounts such as Dhola Maru suggest that the Kachwaha dynasty of Amber originated from the Tejaskarana, the last ruler of the Narwar branch of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty. However, the Kachwaha inscriptions claim a different origin for their dynasty.  Rulers  The following is a list of known Kachchhapaghata rulers, with estimate of their reigns: Simhapaniya (Sihoniya) and Gopadri (Gwalior) branch * Lakshmana (r. c. 950–975) * Vajradaman (r. c. 975–1000) * Mangalaraja (r. c. 1000–1015) * Kirtiraja (r. c. 1015–1035) * Muladeva (r. c. 1035–1055) * Devapala (r. c. 1055–1085) * Padmapala (r. c. 1085–1090) * Mahipala (r. c. 1090–1105) * Ratnapala (r. c. 1105–1130) * Ajayapala (r. c. 1192–1194) * Sulakshanapala (r. c. 1196) Dubkund (Dobha) branch * Yuvaraja (r. c. 1000) * Arjuna (r. c. 1015–1035) * Abhimanyu (r. c. 1035–1045) * Vijayapala (r. c. 1045–1070) * Vikramasimha (r. c. 1070–1100) Nalapura (Narwar) branch * Gaganasimha (r. c. 1075–1090) * Sharadasimha (r. c. 1090–1105) * Virasimha (r. c. 1105–1125) * Tejaskarana  Art and architecture  The dynasty patronized Shaivism and Vaishnavism, but were tolerant towards Buddhism and Jainism. Several temples were constructed during their reign in Kadwaha.

Several silver and gold coins issued by him have also been discovered. Ajayapala (r. c. 1192–1194) had the Gangola tank of Gwalior desilted, as attested by an 1194 inscription.

The library school was a section within the Extension Division's Class-Study Department.\\"University of Chicago library classes.\\" It closed in 1903 after receiving controversial criticisms from the American Library Association. History =Beginnings= The University of Chicago Extension Division began offering courses in “library economy” in January 1897.Grotzinger, 1966, p. 220-4. The courses covered such topics as the history of library economy to 1870, bookbinding, and how to use libraries.University Extension Division, 1896. For the 1897-1898 school year, the program began focusing more on library work and offered three courses: \\"The Modern Library Movement,\\" \\"Cataloging and Classification,\\" and \\"Bibliography and Reference Work.\\"Fogg, 1897. The following year, it offered the courses \\"Historical and Literary Outlines of Library Economy,\\" \\"Technical Methods,\\" and \\"Bibliography and Reference Work.\\"Dixson Papers In 1901, the course \\"Principles of Library Administration\\" was also added.Stauffer, pg. 103. =Shift to Library Training= By 1900, the library courses had completely transformed into a school for training librarians with Zella Allen Dixson as the instructor and director.Stauffer, pg. 101. Students were required to have at least two years of college experience before being admitted into the program. While students of any major were allowed to enroll, credits were only granted to those who were library students.Stauffer, pg. 109. Each course met once a week for a two-hour session with the entire program taking two years to complete. The school used a learn-by-doing strategy in which students worked in the university library. There were three faculty members: Dixson, cataloger Josephine Robertson, and Mary E. Downey.Stauffer, pg. 105. Despite Robertson's requests, the library science courses never became a degree program and instead offered only a certificate to students.Stauffer, pg. 106. =Controversy & Closure= The American Library Association’s College and Reference Library Section sent a letter to University of Chicago President William Rainey Harper criticizing the library school. The exact criticisms were that there were no entrance requirements, only 200 hours were required to complete the program, there was only one instructor (Dixson) and she was incompetent, the program did not provide the opportunity to apply the skills being taught, and the students were promised jobs that they did not receive. Dixson denied each of these allegations and stated her belief that information about the Extension Division and the success of the library school's graduates had been suppressed from the major professional journals of the time. She also claimed that Katharine Sharp, who had founded and directed the library school at the University of Illinois in Urbana, hated everything associated with the University of Chicago and was working with Melvil Dewey of the ALA's College Library Section to eliminate the competition the Extension Division program created with her school. Dixson wrote a letter to Harper reminding him that, if he decided to close down the program, it would cost the university thousands of dollars in returned tuition and cause the school's library to lose its student workers. Faculty member and alumna Mary E. Downey also wrote a letter defending the program. In it, she stated that she chose the University of Chicago Extension Division because it was more practical than several other library schools, including the one at the University of Illinois.Stauffer, pg. 107. In July 1903, the ALA's Committee on Library Training issued a report evaluating different library science programs. The committee consisted of the directors of six of the programs evaluated in the report, including Katharine Sharp of the University of Illinois. The report incorrectly named cataloger Josephine Robertson as the director of the University of Chicago Extension Division's library school and the training program's sole instructor. The report went on to state that the program's admissions requirements were inadequate and that either three years of college or an entrance examination should be required. It also criticized the school for allowing students to only partially complete the program, saying that this policy could cause confusion among potential employers who may believe that the students are all qualified graduates. In October 1903, Harper decided to close the Extension Division's library school. The dean of the University College received many letters of protests, including one from Mary E. Downey who was acting as President of the University of Chicago Library Students Club. Downey requested the school show loyalty to its students by keeping the program open and continuing its work. The letters did not dissuade Harper from closing the library school.

Born in Chicago, Matelli received his BFA from the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design in 1993 and his MFA from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1995. He lives and works in New York City. In 2017 Matelli created the sculpture \\"Hera\\" for and exhibited the work at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, Connecticut as part of their \\"Main Street Sculpture\\" series.http://aldrichart.org/article/hera Incorporating figurative, botanical, and abstract forms in his sculpture, Tony Matelli creates uncanny objects that are both unsettling and comical. His bronze sculptures feature ropes frozen in mid-air, as if the ropes were dropped on a plinth and cast just before collapsing into inert coils. Other works rely on unusual juxtapositions, such as his weeds series in which plants sprout from the space between gallery walls and floors. Across his oeuvre, and particularly in his mirror paintings, Matelli discards traditional genre categories in favor of experiential concerns. “I like sculpture because it’s unwieldy, and there is a resistance to decoration in sculpture that I like,” Matelli has said. “Genres are at the service of ideas, not the other way around.”  Sleepwalker  Most of the sculptor's notoriety has arisen from his work Sleepwalker and the placement of the work therein. First publicly installed outside Wellesley College - an all women's school - the sculpture came under attack both in words and deed. Some students reaction to the work which was first created for display at the institute of higher learning in time with his solo exhibition at Wellesley's Davis Museum, titled \\"New Gravity\\" was similar to that of some people's to Anthony Gormley's figure placed near a ledge on the Empire State Building being called in to emergency services as a jumper; they thought it was a stumbling invasive drunk or otherwise a perpetrator. A petition was then started to demand removal of the work and, as reported by the New York Times, garnered over five hundred signatures, with the organizers stating that it had become “a source of apprehension, fear, and triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault for some members of our campus community.” Matelli responded stating..\\"If you have bad feelings toward this and it’s triggering you, you need to seek sympathy, you need to seek help....”. In 2014 the sculpture was vandalized by spraying yellow paint on it. In the end the sculpture stayed for the course of the exhibition and the boisterous debate continued online, ending in over one thousand signatures asking for the work's removal on change.org. During the spring and summer of 2016 the sculpture is being exhibited along New York City's Highline Park with continued debate and the great interest of onlookers who group around it sometimes in crowds.

It is located off the western banks of the Euphrates River, adjacent to the city of Mayadin and southeast of Dayr az- Zawr. Situated atop a mound with an elevation of , al-Rahba oversees the Syrian Desert steppe and historically guarded the Euphrates valley. It has been described as \\"a fortress within a fortress\\"; it consists of an inner keep measuring , protected by an enclosure measuring . Al-Rahba is largely in ruins today as a result of erosion. The original site, which was known as \\"Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk\\" after its Abbasid namesake and founder, was located along the Euphrates. It was viewed by Muslim armies, caravans and travelers as the key to Syria from Iraq and sometimes vice versa. Bedouin tribes often took control of it and used it as a launching point for invasions of northern Syria. Because of its strategic location, al-Rahba was frequently fought over by Muslim powers, including local lords, the Hamdanids, the Uqaylids, the Mirdasids and the Seljuks, among others. Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk was destroyed in an earthquake in 1157. A few years later, the current fortress was built close to the desert edge by the Zengid–Ayyubid lord Shirkuh. The latter's descendants held al-Rahba as a hereditary fief granted by Saladin until 1264. One of them, Shirkuh II, oversaw a third major reconstruction in 1207. Through the early Mamluk era (late 13th–14th centuries), the fortress was continuously restored and strengthened as a result of frequent sieges by the Ilkhanid Mongols of Iraq. Al-Rahba was the most important Mamluk fortress along the Euphrates, an administrative center and the terminal stop on the sultanate's postal route. It fell into disuse during Ottoman rule (1517–1918) and from then until the early 20th century, the fortress primarily served as a shelter for local shepherds and their flocks. Excavations were carried out at the site between 1976 and 1981. Location and etymology Throughout Islamic history, al-Rahba was considered, in the words of the 14th-century traveler Ibn Batuta, \\"the end of Iraq and the beginning of al-Sham [Syria]\\".Bianquis 1995, p. 395. The fortress is located about southwest of the Euphrates River, southwest of the modern Syrian city of Mayadin,Bylinski 2004, p. 159. and southeast of Dayr az-Zawr, capital of the Dayr az-Zawr Governorate, of which al-Rahba is part. According to the 13th-century geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, the site's name, al- raḥba, translates from Arabic as the \\"flat part of a wadi, where the water collects\\"; al-Rahba's original location was on the western bank of the Euphrates.Bianquis 1995, p. 393. The current fortress is situated on an artificial mound detached from the plateau of the Syrian Desert to its west. Its elevation is above sea level. History =Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk= Founding According to historian Thierry Bianquis, \\"Hardly anything definite is known about the history of the town [al-Rahba] before the Muslim era.\\" Medieval Talmudic and Syriac writers (such as Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus) identified it with the Biblical town of Rehobot han-Nahar (\\"Rehobot by the river [Euphrates]\\"). Some medieval Muslim historians, among them al- Tabari, have written that it was a place called \\"Furda\\" or \\"Furdat Nu'm\\", named after a monastery that supposedly existed in its vicinity called \\"Dayr Nu'm\\". However, the 9th-century Persian historian al-Baladhuri asserts that there was \\"no trace that ar-Rahba ... was an old city\\", and that it was first founded by the Abbasid general Malik ibn Tawk during the reign of Caliph al- Ma'mun (813–833 CE). As such, the fortress town was often referred to as \\"Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk\\" by Muslim historians. According to Syrian historian Suhayl Zakkar, al-Rahba held significant strategic value as it was \\"the key to Syria and sometimes to Iraq\\" and it was the first stop for Syria-bound caravans coming from Iraq.Zakkar 1971, p. 90. From al-Rahba, travelers, caravans and armies could proceed northwestward along the Euphrates route to Aleppo or traverse the desert route to Damascus. Because of its strategic value, it was frequently fought over by rival Muslim powers. Bedouin tribes in particular used al-Rahba as a main launch point for invasions of northern Syria, and as a safe haven and marketplace. Malik ibn Tawk served as its first lord, and after his death in 873, he was succeeded by his son Ahmad.Bianquis 1995, p. 394. The latter was expelled following al-Rahba's capture in 883 by the Abbasid lord of al-Anbar, Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj. By the 10th century, al- Rahba had become a large town.Ashtor 1976, p. 88. In 903, the Qarmatian leader al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh was imprisoned in al-Rahba before being transferred to Caliph al-Mustakfi's custody in Raqqa.Halm 1996, p. 86. At the time, al-Rahba was the center of the Euphrates province and headquarters of its governor, Ibn Sima.Halm 1996, p. 186. Al-Husayn was executed, prompting his partisans from the Banu Ullays tribe to submit to Ibn Sima in al-Rahba in early 904.Halm 1996, p. 184. However, shortly after, they turned against Ibn Sima, whose forces routed them in an ambush in al-Rahba's environs in August. Following further battles, Ibn Sima received another round of surrenders by Qarmatian chieftains and da'is (Ismaili religious leaders).Halm 1996, p. 190. In March 928, the Qarmatians under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi conquered al-Rahba and massacred scores of its inhabitants. Its residents faced hardships for several more years due to civil strife in the surrounding region. Peace was established in 942 with the arrival of an Abbasid commander named Adl who was dispatched by Bajkam, the strongman of the Baghdad-based caliphate. Adl subsequently became governor of the Euphrates and Khabur valley regions. Hamdanid period Al-Rahba came under Hamdanid rule a few years later, becoming part of the Euphrates district (tariq al-Furat) of the Mosul-based emirate.Bianquis 1995, p. 396. At the time, the town was described by the Persian geographer al-Istakhri, as being larger than the ancient Circesium on the opposite side of the Euphrates. The lord of al-Rahba, Jaman, rebelled against the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Nasir al-Dawla (). Jaman fled the town and drowned in the Euphrates, but not before al-Rahba was heavily damaged in the rebellion's suppression. Nasir al-Dawla granted his favored son, Abu'l-Muzzafar Hamdan, control of al-Rahba, its district of Diyar Mudar, and the district's revenues.Islamic Culture January 1998, p. 19. Nasir al-Dawla's sons contested control of al-Rahba in the aftermath of their father's deposition in 969. It ultimately passed to his son Abu Taghlib when his brother and subordinate commander, Hibat-Allah, captured it from Hamdan in a surprise attack.Islamic Culture January 1998, p. 31. Abu Taghlib had al- Rahba's walls rebuilt. He restored al-Rahba to Hamdan to preempt the possibility of his Buyid enemy, Izz al-Dawla al-Bakhtiyar, forming an alliance with Hamdan to undermine Abu Taghlib.Islamic Culture January 1998, p. 56. The Hamdanids lost control of al-Rahba in 978, after which it was captured by the Buyid emir 'Adud al-Dawla (). In 991, al-Rahba's inhabitants requested and received a governor assigned by 'Adud's son, Emir Baha' al-Dawla (). The town was described by Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi in the late 10th century as being the center of the Euphrates district, located on the edge of the desert, having a semi-circular layout and being defended by a strong fortress. He also noted that the wider vicinity was characterized by highly irrigated and productive lands, with abundant date palms and quince groves. Uqaylid and Mirdasid period In the early 11th century, control of al-Rahba was contested between the Uqaylids of Mosul and the Fatimids of Egypt.Ashtor 1976, p. 187. Preceding this conflict, the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim appointed a member of the Al Khafajah tribe, Abu Ali ibn Thimal, as lord of al- Rahba.Zakkar 1971, p. 88. Abu Ali was killed in 1008/09 during a battle with his Uqaylid rivals led by Isa ibn Khalat. The latter lost al-Rahba to another Uqaylid emir, Badran ibn Muqallid. The latter's victory was short-lived as the Fatimid emir of Damascus, Lu'lu, soon captured both al-Rahba and Raqqa, a fortified city to the northwest. He appointed a governor for al-Rahba and returned to Damascus. A wealthy resident of al-Rahba, Ibn Mahkan, revolted against the Fatimids and took control of the town shortly after Lu'lu departed. Though able to oust the Fatimid governor, Ibn Mahkan was unable to hold the town without outside support since al-Rahba was located amid the crossroads of several regional powers who coveted the town. Thus, he gained the backing of the Mirdasid emir of the Banu Kilab tribe, Salih ibn Mirdas. Conflict arose between Ibn Mahkan and Salih leading the latter to besiege al- Rahba. The two reconciled and then Ibn Mahkan and his men captured the fortified town of Anah in Anbar. However, when Ibn Mahkan sought Salih's support in suppressing a revolt in Anah, the latter used the opportunity to kill Ibn Mahkan. After eliminating Ibn Mahkan, Salih became the lord of al- Rahba, and made his allegiance with the Fatimids.Zakkar 1971, p. 89. Al-Rahba was the first major territory Salih held and was the touchstone of the emirate he would establish in Aleppo and much of northern Syria.Amabe 2016, p. 60. His son Thimal later succeeded him as emir of Aleppo, and al-Rahba became his principal power base from which many of his wazirs (advisers or ministers) originated.Amabe 2016, p. 67. He was later compelled by the Fatimids to hand over al-Rahba to their ally Arslan al-Basasiri, a Turkish general who revolted against his Seljuk masters and the Abbasid Caliphate.Zakkar 1971, pp. 149–150. The ceding of al-Rahba to al-Basasiri was the first step in Thimal's loss of the Mirdasid emirate. Together with the loss of Raqqa, it provoked dissension within the Banu Kilab, with Thimal's brother Atiyya resolving to restore the Mirdasid emirate. Al-Basasiri's revolt ultimately failed and he was killed in 1059, prompting Atiyya to capture al-Rahba in April 1060.Zakkar 1971, p. 155. Later, in August 1061, Atiyya successfully defended al-Rahba from Numayrid advances.Zakkar 1971, p. 163. The Mirdasids lost al-Rahba in 1067 to the Uqaylid emir, Sharaf ad-Dawla,Zakkar 1971, p. 170.Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards 2010, p. 163. a vassal of the Abbasid-affiliated Seljuks. Beforehand, Atiyya and part of his army had been in Homs, allowing Sharaf ad-Dawla the opportunity to rout al-Rahba's Banu Kilab defenders. Afterward, the name of the Abbasid caliph was read in the town's khutba (Friday prayer sermons) instead of the Fatimids, a formal recognition of al-Rahba's change of allegiance. In 1086, the Seljuk sultan Malik-Shah granted al-Rahba and its Upper Mesopotamian dependencies, Harran, Raqqa, Saruj and Khabur, to Sharaf ad-Dawla's son, Muhammad.Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards 2010, p. 229. Seljuk period At some point the Seljuks or their Arab allies lost al-Rahba, but in 1093 the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, Tutush captured it along with several other Upper Mesopotamian towns.Başan 2010, p. 99. Following his death, possession of al-Rahba reverted to the Uqaylids,Başan 2010, p. 38. but in 1096, Karbuqa of al-Hillah captured and looted the town. He held onto it until 1102 when Qaymaz, a former mamluk (slave soldier) of the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan, took control of it. Tutush's son Duqaq and the latter's deputy Tughtakin besieged the town, but failed to capture it.Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards 2010, pp. 72–73. Qaymaz died in December 1102 and al-Rahba passed to one of his Turkish mamluks named Hasan, who dismissed many of Qaymaz's officers and arrested several of al-Rahba's notables due to suspicions of a coup against him. Duqaq renewed the siege, but this time was welcomed in by al-Rahba's townspeople, forcing Hasan to retreat into the citadel. Hasan surrendered after receiving guarantees of safe passage from Duqaq as well as an iqta (fief) elsewhere in Syria. According to the 12th-century chronicler Ibn al-Athir, al-Rahba's inhabitants were treated well by Duqaq, who reorganized the administration of the town, established a garrison there, and assigned to it a governor from the Banu Shayban tribe, Muhammad ibn Sabbak. Jawali, a general of the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I, conquered al-Rahba from Ibn Sabbak in May 1107, after a month-long siege.Başan 2010, pp. 116.Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards 2010, pp. 115–116. Ibn al-Athir recorded that al-Rahba's inhabitants suffered greatly during the siege and that some townsmen informed Jawali of a weak point in the fortress's defense in return for promises of safety. When Jawali entered the town and sacked it, Ibn Sabbak surrendered and joined Jawali's service. In 1127, the Seljuk lord of Mosul, Izz ad-Din Mas'ud ibn al-Bursuqi besieged and conquered al-Rahba as part of an attempted invasion of Syria.Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards 2010, p. 268. However, he fell ill and died there shortly after. His lordship in Mosul was taken by Imad ad- Din Zengi, while al-Rahba was left under the control of al-Bursuqi's mamluk, al-Jawali, who ruled it as a subordinate of Zengi. Zengi's son Qutb ad-Din captured al-Rahba some years later. In 1149, Qutb ad-Din's brother Nur ad-Din received al-Rahba in Seljuk-sponsored negotiations between the Zengid lords. =Al-Rahba al-Jadida= Ayyubid period The fortress of al-Rahba as seen from the city of Mayadin Al-Rahba was destroyed in an earthquake in 1157. Four years later, Nur ad-Din granted the territories of al-Rahba and Homs as a fief to Shirkuh, who had a certain Yusuf ibn Mallah administer it on his behalf. According to the 14th-century Ayyubid historian, Abu'l-Fida, Shirkuh rebuilt al-Rahba. Abu'l-Fida's assertion may have been incorrect or the fortress built by Shirkuh fell into a ruinous state at some point before the century's end. In any case, the new fortress, which became known as \\"al-Rahba al-Jadida\\", was relocated about five kilometers west of the Euphrates' western bank, where the original site, \\"Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk\\", had been situated. When Shirkuh died, his territories reverted to Nur ad-Din. However, Shirkuh's nephew and the founder of the Ayyubid Sultanate, Saladin, conquered Nur ad- Din's domains by 1182 and granted Homs and al-Rahba to Shirkuh's son, Nasir ad-Din Muhammad, as a hereditary emirate. According to the Ayyubid-era chronicler and one-time resident of al-Rahba, Ibn Nazif, the fortress of al- Rahba was rebuilt again by Shirkuh's grandson, al-Mujahid Shirkuh II (), in 1207.Bylinski 1999, p. 162. Al-Rahba was the easternmost fortress of Shirkuh II's Homs-based emirate, and was one of the four principal centers of the emirate, the other three being Homs itself, Salamiyah and Palmyra. He personally oversaw the demolition of al-Rahba's ruins and the construction of the new fortress. Al-Rahba remained in the hands of Shirkuh's descendants until a few years after the annexation of Ayyubid Syria by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1260. Mamluk period In 1264, the Mamluk sultan Baybars () replaced the Ayyubid governor of al-Rahba with one of his mamluk officers from Egypt. Al-Rahba's garrison and its commander held a high place in the Mamluk military hierarchy. The fortress, along with and al-Bira to the north, emerged as the principal Mamluk bulwark against Mongol invasions of Syria's eastern frontier.Amitai-Preisse 1995, p. 77. It was the Mamluks' most important fortress along the Euphrates, supplanting Raqqa, which had been the traditional Muslim center in the Euphrates valley since the 10th century. A large population of refugees from areas ruled by the Mongols settled in al- Rahba as did many people from the adjacent, unfortified town of Mashhad al- Rahba (former site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk, modern-day Mayadin). It was also the terminal stop of the Mamluk barid (postal route) and an administrative center.Amitai-Preisse 1995, p. 75. Throughout the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, al-Rahba was situated near the tribal territory of the Al Fadl.Amitai-Preiss 1995, p. 64. About four hundred Al Fadl tribesmen joined the small army of Caliph al-Mustansir, the Egypt-based Abbasid caliph dispatched by Baybars to recapture Baghdad from the Mongols, when he reached al-Rahba.Amitai-Preiss 1995, pp. 57–58. The latter was al-Mustansir's first stop after he rode out from Damascus, but his campaign ultimately failed and he was killed in a Mongol ambush in al-Anbar. The Mongols of Ilkhanid Iraq inflicted significant damage on al-Rahba during their wars with the Mamluks. The fortress was restored by Baybars at some point toward the end of his reign. In 1279, the Mamluk viceroy of Syria, Sunqur al-Ashqar, rebelled against Sultan Qalawun () and took refuge with the Al Fadl chieftain, Isa ibn Muhanna, at al-Rahba, where he requested the intervention of the Mongol ruler Abaqa Khan. When the Mongols could not help him, Sunqur fled the incoming Mamluk army, while Isa barricaded himself in the fortress. The Mongols' failure to capture al-Rahba after a month-long siege commanded by the Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü in 1312/13 marked the Ilkhanate's final attempt to invade Mamluk Syria. Isa's son Muhanna rebelled against Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad () in 1320, and was pursued by the Mamluk army as far al-Rahba. During the ensuing confrontation, the fortress may have been destroyed. Ottoman era Under the Ottomans, who conquered Syria and Iraq in the early 16th century, al-Rahba's military use apparently diminished. During the Middle Ages, the road between Palmyra and al-Rahba was the most important Syrian desert route, but its importance declined during Ottoman rule. From then on, al-Rahba was mostly used as a shelter for shepherds from nearby villages and their flocks. In 1588, it was visited by the Venetian traveler Gasparo Balbi, who noted a dilapidated fortress and inhabitants known as \\"Rahabi\\" living below it. The French traveler, Jean- Baptiste Tavernier, mentioned Mashhad Rahba, southwest of the fortress, during his travels there in circa 1632. In 1797, French traveler Guillaume-Antoine Olivier passed by al-Rahba, mentioning that it was a fortress and a ruined site. Excavations The fortress has deteriorated considerably as a result of erosion. Excavations were carried out at al-Rahba, including the presumed site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk along the Euphrates bank, between 1976 and 1981 under the auspices of Syria's General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums, the Institut Français d'Etudes Arabes de Damas and the University of Lyon II. In later years, surveys of the site and the surrounding desert and Euphrates and Khabur valleys were carried out by multi-disciplinary teams of Syrian, American and European archaeologists.Bianquis 1995, pp. 395–396. One of the French surveyors, J. L. Paillet, sketched the plans and elevations of the fortress, which are detailed in his 1983 dissertation, Le château de Rahba, étude d'architecture militaire islamique médiévale. Excavations at the foot of the fortress between 1976 and 1978 revealed a medieval settlement within a quadrangular enclosure, some of whose walls measured up to long and high. The walls generally have a thickness of . Among the unearthed structures were the probable remains of a khan (caravanserai), a congregational mosque with a small oratory, and a cavalry barracks. There was also a system of canals that brought in fresh water and emptied sewage. Among the artifacts found at the fortress and the former settlement beneath it were pottery sherds and coins (mostly Mamluk and a few Ayyubid) and numerous feather fletches belonging to arrows left over by Mongol besiegers. During the ongoing Syrian Civil War, looting and illegal digging for antiquities have occurred at al-Rahba. Affected areas include the fortress's storage rooms and courtyards, as well as the medieval settlement at its foot. Architecture =Specifications and components= The citadel of al-Rahba is described by historian Janusz Bylinski as \\"a fortress within a fortress\\".Bylinski 2004, p. 162. Its core consists of a four-story, pentagon-shaped keep, roughly measuring . The keep is enclosed by a pentagon-shaped wall, roughly measuring . The outer wall's shape was described by Paillet as a triangle with its two parallel angles having been chamfered and substituted with short curtain walls.Bylinski 2004, p. 160. Around the artificial mound upon which the fortress sits is a moat with a depth of and a width of . Al-Rahba's moat is considerably deeper than the Ayyubid-era desert fortresses of Palmyra and Shumaimis. A large cistern makes up the lowest floor of the keep. Several bastions were built along the external walls of the fortress. The western and southeastern sides contained al-Rahba's four largest bastions, with the largest measuring and the smallest being . These bastions supported heavy defensive artillery. Their height surpassed the towers of Palmyra and Shumaimis probably because the latter forts' locations on isolated hills did not necessitate \\"state of the art defensive artillery\\", according to Bylinski. By contrast, at al-Rahba, enemy siege engines could be placed at the close-by plateaus, which were almost at level with the fortress. Al-Rahba's smallest bastion is on its northern, less vulnerable wall and measures . Both the external walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher than their counterparts along the external wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls. The core building was linked to the external fortifications by corridors and chambers. =Construction phases= Though large parts of the building are in ruins, excavations have determined that al-Rahba went through at least eight undated construction phases probably starting from the early Ayyubid period. For the most part, each phase utilized different architectural techniques and fortification concepts, and none of the phases affected the entire extent of the building at one time.Bylinski 2004, p. 161. One common theme of the phases was the restoration or strengthening of al-Rahba's western and southeastern sides, which faced the desert plateau and were the most exposed areas of the fortress. In contrast, the northern side facing the population centers remained largely unchanged. The first phase saw the walls built with mudbrick, a very common feature of Euphrates-area structures. Although the shape of the building after its initial phase cannot be determined, Paillet presumes that its size likely corresponded to that of the current building. The small salient bastion that juts out of the northern wall dates to the first phase. The second phase of construction added three salient bastions, each of which were over twice the size of the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders in the second phase also reinforced al- Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high- quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.Bylinski 2004, pp. 160–161. In the fourth phase, low-lying casemates were added to the western and southwestern curtains to provide an additional platform for al-Rahba's defenders to use. The walls, particularly on the eastern side, were reinforced in the fifth phase, which Paillet attributes to the efforts of Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria. The building technique used in this phase likely necessitated significant funds, equipment and technical expertise. Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al- Rahba was erected during this phase, likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard. The last major building phase was the sixth, which saw the restoration of the eastern and western external walls after they were severely damaged by Mongol besiegers. A northeastern salient bastion, much smaller than the eastern and western bastions, was also built. Masonry from the fifth phase was reused for the reconstruction along with new gypsum, limestone and other materials. The seventh and eighth phases both consisted of heightening al- Rahba's western external walls.

She is a supporter of the art scene in Jeddah. She opened her own museum and gallery, the Darat Safeya Binzagr in 2000. Binzagr is the only artist in her country to have their own museum.  Early years  Binzagr was born in 1940 to a \\"well-known merchant family\\" in Jeddah. Binzagr was privately taught art in Egypt and went on to earn a degree from St Martin's School of Art in 1965.  Career  Her first exhibition took place in 1968. In 1970, she was the first woman to hold a solo exhibition of her work in Saudi Arabia. Despite her art being presented, she was not allowed to attend the openings of her own exhibitions until Aramco held a private exhibition of her work in 1976. She was instead represented by male members of her family. In 1973, she chose to stop selling her art. In 1979, she published a book about Saudi Arabian art called Saudi Arabia, An Artist's View of the Past. The book has been translated into English and French. Binzagr's work uses various mediums, ranging from oil paint, watercolor, pastel, drawing and etchings. Her work often centers around daily life in Saudi Arabia. She has series of works based on themes such as marriage customs, local costumes and old homes in Saudi Arabia. Binzagr paints cultural themes in order to preserve the cultural traditions of her country. Some of her paintings are based on descriptions given to her by older women about their lives. Binzagr meticulously researches her paintings, either by capturing through photographs images of buildings, craftwork and neighborhoods or by looking through historic documents and photography. Much of the history she has recorded belongs to the Hejaz cultural tradition. Binzagr's work can be seen in her museum, the Darat Safeya Binzagr, where admission is free. She started to imagine a place where she could permanently display and curate her work in 1989. The museum took about nine years of planning and construction and was opened in 2000. The museum serves as her home, her studio, and as a gallery of her work. Binzagr hosts public events at her museum to promote art in Saudi Arabia.

He is best known as the founder of the fortress town of al-Rahba on the western banks of the Euphrates, part of the modern-day Syrian town of Mayadin. Biography Malik ibn Tawk belonged to the Arab tribe of Banu Taghlib and traced his lineage to the 6th-century Taghlibi poet warrior Amr ibn Kulthum. His father, Tawk ibn Malik, served as governor of Diyar Rabi'a, the province of eastern Upper Mesopotamia (al-Jazira) under the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). He also served as a general under al- Ma'mun's predecessor, Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), Some Muslim sources have often incorrectly made the son Malik ibn Tawk to have been the one in the service of Harun and al-Ma'mun instead of his father. Malik ibn Tawk served under the caliphs al-Wathiq (r. 842–847) and al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) as the governor of Jund al-Urdunn (military district of Jordan) and Jund Dimashq (military district of Damascus). Sometime in the latter half of the 9th century, Malik convinced his kinsman, Sahl ibn Bishr, a great-grandson of the 7th-century Taghlibi poet al-Akhtal, to convert to Islam from Christianity along with the other direct descendants of al-Akhtal. Malik founded the Euphrates Valley fortress of al-Rahba and became its lord. The fortress town was since alternatively known as \\"Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk\\". He died in 873. His son Ahmad succeeded him as the lord of al-Rahba, but was forced out of the town in 883 by the lord of al-Anbar, Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj.

They gathered in several places within the fort, in the military hospital or individuals, such as John Thevenot houses, who was mayor from 1765 to 1778. British occupiers even got to prohibit the presence of the priests and all expression religious. Internal view The recovery of the colony by the French in January 1817 changed the situation.

It is located in Brasilia, Brazil. The Center has many interconnected buildings. The oldest of them dates back to the 70s, when it housed the headquarters of the Cultural Foundation of the Federal District. Other structures were gradually incorporated over time, including the Center for Creativity. In the 80s, the Cultural Center faced difficult times, but the local community gave support in its reactivation. The building was renovated based on a project signed by Antonio Eustáquio, subsidized by the Mokiti Okada Foundation. It was re-inaugurated on September 13, 1993. Simultaneously, it received its current name, a tribute to the singer Renato Russo (1960-1996), the former member of the musical group Legião Urbana, nationally known in Brazil. The Renato Russo Cultural Center comprises the Galpão Theater, a multipurpose room, a video room, a movie theater, a shed for workshops, a library, a mezzanine, a laboratory and administrative offices. Since December 20, 2013, the Cultural Center has been closed due to its poor physical conditions. The list of problems is substantial: cracks, exposed wires, damaged doors, and lack of accessibility, as well as serious inadequacies in hydraulic, electrical and structural parts of the building. Although the situation was informed to the district agencies which are responsible for the place, the Government of the Federal District still hasn't concluded the works announced in 2015, nor reopened the facilities.

He gave the first necessary and sufficient condition for positive invariance of closed sets under the flow induced by ordinary differential equations (Nagumo/Bony-Brezis theorem).  Biography  Mitio Nagumo graduated from the Department of Mathematics at the Imperial University of Tokyo in March 1928. In March 1931 he was appointed Lecturer in the Faculty of Technology at the Imperial University of Kyushu. In February 1932 he left Japan for an academic visit to Göttingen, where he remained for two years. Upon his return from Göttingen in March 1934, he was appointed Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the Imperial University of Osaka, and was promoted to Associate Professor in September that year, becoming Professor in the Faculty of Science in March 1936. In March 1937 Nagumo received a Doctor of Science degree from the Imperial University of Tokyo.

It takes its name from the Buraco das Araras (Hole of Macaws), a large sinkhole that is the main feature of the reserve. Location The reserve is in the municipality of Jardim, Mato Grosso do Sul and contains a huge sinkhole in circumference and deep. The hole would have been known to the original inhabitants of the area. It was rediscovered in 1912 by a local worker, and named the Buraco das Araras (Macaw Hole) after the many macaws flying around it. According to local legend the hole was used over the years as a place to dispose of cattle thieves and others whom the local ranchers or politicians wanted to eliminate. The sinkhole was vandalized, with the walls and macaws used as targets for guns, and rubbish thrown into the hole including stolen cars. Reserve The privately-owned reserve was created on 11 April 2007. It is classed as IUCN protected area category IV (habitat/species management area). It covers an area of in the Cerrado biome. There is a vivid green lagoon at the bottom of the sinkhole surrounded by thriving vegetation. The hole is occupied by caimans, armadillos, anteaters, coatis, foxes, the macaws for which it is named, ibises, toucans and many other species of birds. The owner manages the reserve and is responsible for compliance with the legal requirements for a private natural heritage reserve. Visitors are accompanied in groups of no more than ten people by a tour guide or local environmental monitor on a walk around the sinkhole.

Q. rapax is the first (chronologically and otherwise) cariamiform bird to have been found in Asia. It is very similar to the Eocene Strigogyps, but it differs in being smaller, and in having a hypertrophied, hyperextensible second toe, forming a claw analogous to that of dromeosaur dinosaurs. This toe is thought to allowed the bird to better pin down captured prey. Although very little wing-material is known, the condylar processes suggest it was capable of flight, and probably was a flier superior to either Strigogyps or modern seriemas.

The 40-story tower is tall with 398 luxury apartments. Plans for the project were first proposed in 2013 and construction began in late 2014. It is located at the intersection of 2nd Avenue and Pine Street near the Pike Place Market and the city's retail core. Architects Weber Thompson and GBD Architects, working on the project in a joint venture, described the tower's design as \\"slender and sculpted\\". It sits atop a podium, housing of retail space, with a terra-cotta facade. The building also includes Zipcar parking spaces, electric vehicle charging stations, bicycle parking, low-energy appliances, and other environmentally-friendly features in a bid to earn a LEED rating. The five-story, 217-stall underground parking garage extends north from the tower's lot to a site that will be occupied by a 16-story hotel developed by Widewaters Group. History The site at 2nd Avenue and Pine Street was originally proposed for a residential tower developed by Paul Brenneke and planned to break ground in 2006. Plans were scrapped after a new downtown zoning ordinance was approved in 2006, and a new, 23-story, $200 million mixed-use highrise named \\"1 Hotel & Residences\\" was proposed by Brenneke and Starwood Capital Group. The proposed building would have 98 luxury condominiums and a 110-room hotel as well as four floors of retail at ground level and a luxury gym. The project broke ground in 2007 and was expected to be completed in 2009, but construction was halted in September 2007 because of the then-ongoing financial crisis, and designs were revised to eliminate over 100 proposed condominium units after only 20 of them had been sold. Brenneke sold his stake in the project to Starwood in June 2008, citing the project's financial difficulties. The excavated hole was later filled in 2009 and paved over with a parking lot. The half-block property was bought by Chicago-based Equity Residential in 2012 for $22 million, and the company announced its plans for a 39-story apartment building in January 2013. Construction of the building, led by Turner Construction, began in October 2014 and was completed in 2017.

Irwin posted a fifth in that first race, which was coincidentally the team's best finish in competition. Irwin made four more starts, posting another fifth at Dover International Speedway. Team owner Jarrett made one start at Darlington Speedway and fell victim to overheating. Jason Jarrett, Dale's son, made one start at Gateway Motorsports Park and finished 25th, one lap down. Steve Grissom made four starts near the end of the season, recording a best finish of 13th at Memphis International Raceway. In 2000, the team shifted its focus to the younger Jarrett, with Rayovac returning as primary sponsor. Jarrett struggled mightily in the first nineteen races of the season, posting his only top-20 finish at Daytona International Speedway, crashing out of three races, and failing to qualify for eight other races, making for only eleven starts. To try to help performance, the team switched from Pontiacs to Chevrolets and changed crew chiefs from Wes Ward to Rick Bowman. However, neither of the changes seemed to improve performance, so journeyman driver Hut Stricklin was hired to run two races, at Pikes Peak International Raceway and Gateway. Stricklin only qualified for the race at Pikes Peak and finished 28th. Stricklin also attempted the fall race for the team at Phoenix International Raceway, but did not qualify. Jarrett returned to the car after the Gateway race, but failed to qualify for three more races and posted a best finish of 22nd at Bristol Motor Speedway, even as Verizon Wireless came on board as an associate sponsor.

Its first leg followed present-day Sønder Boulevard and was then dug through Valby Hill on its way to the old village of Vigerslev. J. C. Jacobsen established his Carlsberg Brewert on the north side of the railway when a natural spring was encountered during the excavation work for the rail line. The English railway company also constructed a bridge across the railway next to the brewery. TVigerslev Allé with the F.L. Smidt site In 1864, the first part of the railway was replaced by a railway line which followed a more northernly course by way of Frederiksberg. The farmers in Bigerslev then used the abandoned railway tracks to drive their cattle into Copenhagen. In 1897 the old railway was reopened and used for transporting materials from the quarries at Hedehusene to the reclamation of what is now Kalvebod Brygge. Vigerslev Allé was established on the south side of the railway when it was expanded into a four-track rail line following the completion of the work on Kalvebod Brygge. The now demolished Valby Gasworks was built on Vigerslev Allé between 1903 and 1907. It was designed by Andreas Fussing. Another demolished building on the street is Carl Aller's printing business from 1936-38.

She became mostly known for her spastic episodes of euphoria in which many of her congregation believed that she may have been under demonic possession  Early life  Cardeñosa, Spain Avila, Spain Santa Ana, Caceres Vela y Cueto was born in Cardeñosa, Spain to parents Don Diego Alvarez y Cueto, and Doña Ana de Aguirre who were part of the Spanish Aristocracy. She was born into wealth on Easter Sunday in 1561, being the third child after her parents had conceived two older brothers; Diego and Lorenzo. After Vela y Cueto's birth, Don Diego and Doña Ana went on to conceive two more children; Jeronima and Isabel. It is said that \\"all but one, Diego, did not follow the ecclesiastical route\\" Both of Vela y Cueto's parents raised them in a strictly religious household which explains the careers paths that she and her siblings took. Although born in Cardeñosa, she was raised the majority of her young life in the nearby provincial capital of Avila, Spain. In 1570, tragedy would befall her and her family when her father Don Diego died, a year before Vela y Cueto's first communion which lead the family into a state of poverty. At fifteen Vela y Cueto decided to make the monastic life part of her permanent life as she entered into the Cistercian house of Santa Ana. She remained in the Cistercian house for forty years. However, her decision to devote her life to the Catholic church is rare since it was a custom for those days to have marriage as a first option, the church as a second option, and prostitution as your last chance to survive in a world that would frown upon you of this life was chosen.  Convent life  \\"On February 2, 1576 [Vela y Cueto's sisters Jeronima and Isabel carried her into the Convent because she was] too frail to cross the threshold by foot\\" Vela y Cueto was said to have been a sickly person \\"ailing, to the age of fifty-six\\" however she outlived her youngest sister Isabel but she was determined to live a life of celibacy and was willing to wait for six years until she could finally take her vows. Both of her younger sisters also took the same vow and became nuns in the same Cistercian house as Vela y Cueto. During her stay in Santa Ana, Vela y Cueto started experiencing signs which claimed to come from God. These experiences were deemed to be visions, hearing of celestial voices, trances, fits, and bodily contortions that would make the other nuns and clergy members wonder if her mental capabilities had suffered form her constant state of sickness or if these experiences weren't from up above but were actually her who had gotten possessed by a demon. Abbesses where alarmed at her outlandish nature an would control Vela y Cueto' s behavior by forcing her to confess. Through these \\"divinely inspired\\" fits she claimed that she \\"hears Christ lament that humanity has forgotten that he suffered for them, and so she suffers with him to renew the observance of the rule within her convent. The spectacle of her mortified flesh brings the image of Christ's passion before the eyes of her community, which responds with ridicule and scandal.\\" The monastery was very disturbed by these claims of hers that Vela y Cueto claimed that \\" a sister who has made her profession but is so unhappy with everything in the convent that is not to her liking that she goes around crying like a two-year-old.\\". Vela y Cueto found no solace among her monastic sisters and brother, in the end she turned to her real brothers, Lorenzo and Diego \\"who would tolerate no disparaging remarks about her, insisting that their sister was 'a saint' even when her fellow nuns in the convent challenged the sanctity that Maria's brothers associated with her extreme ascetism and visions. In 1603 Vela y Cueto would cross paths with Dr. Miguel Gonzalez Vaquero who ended being her spiritual supervisor and sympathizer of sorts. Vaquero was a secular priest who was also raised in Avila and heard about the thrashing nun and decided to make it his personal goal to help Vela y Cueto make sense of her divine interventions.

From 1901 to 1921, Deinard held the position of rabbi at Temple Israel in Minneapolis, Minnesota. thumb  Family and education  Samuel Nathaniel Deinard was born on January 25, 1873 in Raseiniai, Lithuania to father David Menachem and mother Taube Leah. In 1882 the family moved to Palestine. By 1888 Samuel was sent to Germany on a Baron de Rothschild scholarship to prepare for ordination as a rabbi. By 1892 Samuel had graduated early and went to the United States, graduating from DePauw University in 1896 and then in 1902 obtaining a master's degree from the University of Chicago Divinity School. In 1905 he completed his studies at the University of Minnesota, obtaining a doctorate in Semitic studies. Deinard became a professor of Semitic languages and literature at the University of Minnesota In 1896, Deinard married Rose, his distant cousin; they had three children: Amos, Benedict, and Miriam. Amos and Benedict would later go on to found the law firm Leonard, Street, and Deinard in 1922.History, Stinson Leonard Street (2016)  Temple Israel  In 1901, Rabbi Deinard was hired at Shaarai Tov (later named Temple Israel), the oldest Jewish synagogue in Minneapolis. Deinard promoted peace and partnership between the older, more established community of German Jews, and the newer, more Orthodox Jews coming from Eastern Europe. Although Deinard was a supporter of Reform Judaism, he was welcoming to Orthodox families in the community. Under his leadership the once-struggling congregation saw a steady growth in membership, the building of a new Temple edifice, and a general growth of status and influence in both the Jewish community and the community as a whole. Deinard was also a strong supporter of Zionism, even at a time when Zionism was not generally accepted by the Reform community Deinard was active within non-Jewish communities as well, serving as the first president of the Minneapolis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  American Jewish World  Deinard worked to get a Jewish newspaper off the ground in the Twin Cities. His first three efforts were short lived -- Jewish Progress, followed by The Judean, and then The Scribe. Each failed to secure financial support. However, in 1912, Jewish Weekly was launched; this eventually became The American Jewish World. In 1915, Deinard handed the reins over to Leonard H. Frisch to act as publisher, production, and sales manager. Today the newspaper still stands as an important news resource for the local Jewish community.  Death  On October 12, 1921, Temple Israel's congregation gathered for Kol Nidre Service on Yom Kippur eve. Deinard was not in attendance, as he died from a heart attack earlier in the day. His sudden death, coupled with his popularity and relative young age, stunned the local Jewish community. His funeral was held at Temple Israel and his burial followed at Montefiore Cemetery (now known as Temple Israel Cemetery). Deinard's successor, Rabbi Albert G. Minda, remarked about Deinard's funeral: \\"A multitude of people attended the services, said to be the largest and most diversified group present at any funeral ever held in Minneapolis up to that time.\\"  References   External links  * American Jewish World newspaper * Finding aid to the Temple Israel records at the Upper Midwest Jewish Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries.

There are several proposed mechanisms for neuronal death in PD; however, not all of them are well understood. Five proposed major mechanisms for neuronal death in Parkinson's Disease include protein aggregation in Lewy bodies, disruption of autophagy, changes in cell metabolism or mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown resulting in vascular leakiness. Protein aggregation A brain tissue with Lewy bodies. The first major proposed cause of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is the bundling, or oligomerization, of proteins. The protein alpha-synuclein has increased presence in the brains of Parkinson's Disease patients and, as α-synuclein is insoluble, it aggregates to form Lewy bodies (shown to left) in neurons. Traditionally, Lewy bodies were thought to be the main cause of cell death in Parkinson's disease; however, more recent studies suggest that Lewy bodies lead to other effects that cause cell death. Regardless, Lewy bodies are widely recognized as a pathological marker of Parkinson's disease. Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata, and pontine tegmentum; patients at this stage are asymptomatic. As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain, and in the neocortex. This mechanism is substantiated by the facts that α-synuclein lacks toxicity when unable to form aggregates; that heat-shock proteins, which assist in refolding proteins susceptible to aggregation, beneficially affect PD when overexpressed; and that reagents which neutralize aggregated species protect neurons in cellular models of α-synuclein overexpression. Alpha- synuclein appears to be a key link between reduced DNA repair and Parkinson’s disease. Alpha-synuclein activates ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), a major DNA damage repair signaling kinase. Alpha-synuclein binds to breaks in double-stranded DNA and facilitates the DNA repair process of non-homologous end joining. It was suggested that cytoplasmic aggregation of alpha-synuclein to form Lewy bodies reduces its nuclear levels leading to decreased DNA repair, increased DNA double-strand breaks and increased programmed cell death of neurons. Autophagy disruption An image illustrating Autophagy. The second major proposed mechanism for neuronal death in Parkinson's disease, autophagy, is a mechanism by which inner components of the cell are broken down and recycled for use. Autophagy has been shown to play a role in brain health, helping to regulate cellular function. Disruption of the autophagy mechanism can lead to several different types of diseases like Parkinson's disease. Autophagy dysfunction in Parkinson's disease has also been shown to lead to dysregulated mitochondria degradation. Changes in cell metabolism A simplified illustration of energy production in a mitochondrion. The third major proposed cause of cell death in Parkinson's disease involves the energy- generating mitochondrion organelle. In Parkinson's disease, mitochondrial function is disrupted, inhibiting energy production and resulting in death. The mechanism behind mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is hypothesized to be the PINK1 and Parkin complex, having been shown to drive autophagy of mitochondria (also known as mitophagy). PINK1 is a protein normally transported into the mitochondrion, but can also accumulate on the surface of impaired mitochondria. Accumulated PINK1 then recruits Parkin; Parkin initiates the break down of dysfunctional mitochondria, a mechanism that acts as a \\"quality control\\" In Parkinson's disease, the genes coding PINK1 and Parkin are thought to be mutated, therefore preventing the breakdown of impaired mitochondria, causing abnormal function and morphology of mitochondria and eventually cell death Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have also been shown to accumulate with age indicating that susceptibility to this mechanism of neuronal death increases with age. Another mitochondrial- related mechanism for cell death in Parkinson's disease is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are highly reactive molecules that contain oxygen and can disrupt functions within the mitochondria and the rest of the cell. With increasing age, mitochondria lose their ability to remove ROS yet still maintain their production of ROS, causing an increase in net production of ROS and eventually cell death. As reviewed by Puspita et al. studies have demonstrated that in the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, alpha- synuclein and dopamine levels are likely involved in contributing to oxidative stress as well as PD symptoms. Oxidative stress appears to have a role in mediating separate pathological events that together ultimately result in cell death in PD. Oxidative stress leading to cell death may be the common denominator underlying multiple processes. Oxidative stress causes oxidative DNA damage. Such damage is increased in the mitochondria of the substantia nigra of PD patients and may lead to nigral neuronal cell death. Neuroinflammation Microglia(green) interacting with neurons(red). The fourth proposed major mechanism of neuronal death in Parkinson's Disease, neuroinflammation, is generally understood for neurodegenerative diseases, however, specific mechanisms are not completely characterized for PD. One major cell type involved in neuroinflammation is the microglia. Microglia are recognized as the innate immune cells of the central nervous system. Microglia actively survey their environment and change their cell morphology significantly in response to neural injury. Acute inflammation in the brain is typically characterized by rapid activation of microglia. During this period, there is no peripheral immune response. Over time, however, chronic inflammation causes the degradation of tissue and of the blood–brain barrier. During this time, microglia generate reactive oxygen species and release signals to recruit peripheral immune cells for an inflammatory response. In addition, microglia are known to have two major states: M1, a state in which cells are activated and secrete pro-inflammatory factors; and M2, a state in which cells are deactivated and secrete anti-inflammatory factors. Microglia are usually in a resting state (M2), but in Parkinson's disease can enter M1 due to the presence of α-synuclein aggregates. The M1 microglia release pro- inflammatory factors which can cause motor neurons to die. In this case, dying cells can release factors to increase the activation of M1 microglia, leading to a positive feedback loop which causes continually increasing cell death. BBB breakdown An image depicting blood-brain barrier shape and function. The fifth proposed major mechanism for cell death is the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB has three cell types which tightly regulate the flow of molecules in and out of the brain: endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. In neurodegenerative diseases, BBB breakdown has been measured and identified in specific regions of the brain, including the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease and hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease. Protein aggregates or cytokines from neuroinflammation may interfere with cell receptors and alter their function in the BBB. Most notably, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors are thought to be dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases. The interaction between the VEGF protein and its receptors leads to cell proliferation, but is believed to be disrupted in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This then causes cells to stop growing and therefore, prevents new capillary formation via angiogenesis. Cell receptor disruption can also affect the ability for cells to adhere to one another with adherens junctions. Without new capillary formation, the existing capillaries break down and cells start to dissociate from each other. This in turn leads to the breakdown of gap junctions. Gap junctions in endothelial cells in the BBB help prevent large or harmful molecules from entering the brain by regulating the flow of nutrients to the brain. However, as gap junctions break down, plasma proteins are able to enter in extracellular matrix the brain. This mechanism is also known as vascular leakiness, where capillary degeneration leads to blood and blood proteins \\"leaking\\" into the brain. Vascular leakiness can eventually cause neurons to alter their function and shift towards apoptotic behavior or cell death. Impact on locomotion An image depicting Parkinsonian gait. Dopaminergic neurons are the most abundant type of neuron in the substantia nigra, a part of the brain regulating motor control and learning. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which activates motor neurons in the central nervous system. The activated motor neurons then transmit their signals, via action potential, to motor neurons in the legs. However, when a significant percentage of the motor neurons die (about 50-60%), this decreases dopamine levels by up to 80%. This inhibits the ability for neurons to generate and transmit a signal. This transmission inhibition ultimately causes the characteristic Parkinsonian gait with symptoms such as hunched and slowed walking or tremors.

The new station, which is partially being funded by the Florida Department of Transportation, will serve as the Orlando station for the Brightline inter-city rail service, which will connect Orlando International Airport to downtown Miami via the Florida East Coast Railway. The terminal building and the adjacent parking garage opened on November 17, 2017, while work on the train terminal continues. The facility is connected to the main airport terminal roughly a mile to the north via an automated people mover (APM) system. History Orlando Intermodal Terminal under construction (2017) The facility mostly reuses plans from the proposed Florida High Speed Rail system. In that plan, the Orlando International Airport station was to be the northern terminus of the initial Tampa-to- Orlando route along Interstate 4. The plan was effectively cancelled when Florida governor Rick Scott announced he would reject federal funding for the project. The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority had already invested considerably to accommodate the station and high-speed rail line, such as the extra length of the south taxiway bridges over the southern airport access road, which will now be used by Brightline. As part of the $684 million intermodal complex, the airport authority has also built a 2,400 space parking garage. Future use The SunRail commuter rail line is also considering a extension to the airport terminal. The extension would travel from the existing SunRail line along an Orlando Utilities Commission rail spur, which runs along the southern boundary of the airport's property. The route is used exclusively by coal trains to serve the Curtis H. Stanton Energy Center in eastern Orange County. From there, two options are currently under consideration; one plan would have SunRail trains branch north off of the existing OUC line and onto a new spur that would terminate at the planned South Airport Intermodal Terminal. The second option being explored would be to build a transfer station along the OUC line where passengers would transfer from SunRail trains onto light rail trains that would run along a dedicated 2-mile line between the transfer and airport stations. In addition to Brightline and SunRail, the station might also serve one of two proposed rail connections to International Drive. There were plans for an elevated maglev train system, but those were scrapped in 2015. The current plan is for a light rail line that would most likely connect the airport and with the Orange County Convention Center, Florida Mall, and the Sand Lake Road SunRail station before reaching International Drive.

History In paintings, Mary is traditionally portrayed in blue. This tradition can trace its origin to the Byzantine Empire, from circa 500 AD, where blue was \\"the color of an empress\\". A more practical explanation for the use of this color is that in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, the blue pigment was derived from the rock lapis lazuli, a stone imported from Afghanistan of greater value than gold. Beyond a painter's retainer, patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting. Hence, it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the Virgin in gowns of blue.

Crawler-based robotic tools are commonly used for in-line inspection (ILI) applications in pipelines that cannot be inspected using traditional intelligent pigging tools (or unpiggable pipelines). Robotic NDT tools can also be used for mandatory inspections in inhospitable areas (e.g., tank interiors, subsea petroleum installations) to minimize danger to human inspectors, as these tools are operated remotely by a trained technician or NDT analyst. These systems transmit data and commands via either a wire (typically called an umbilical cable or tether) or wirelessly (in the case of battery-powered tetherless crawlers).  Applications  Robotic NDT tools help pipeline operators and utility companies complete required structural integrity data sets for maintenance purposes in the following applications: * Petroleum and public utility pipelines ** Pipe walls ** Girth welds * Nuclear cooling systems * Storage tanks ** Floor plates ** Shell plates ** Welds Pipeline conditions that may prevent or hinder a flow-driven pig inspection include: * Some pipe fittings (e.g., small-radius bends, tees, butterfly valves, reducers) may be impassable for bulky inspection pigs. ** Technicians can manually adjust robotic tool travel speed, orientation, and configuration to navigate fittings that might trap or damage a free-flowing pig. * Product flow may not be conducive to pig travel. ** Technician control of self- propelled crawler travel reduces the risk of velocity-based sensor malfunction. ** Real-time tool monitoring allows the technician to adjust the tool run immediately if readings become unacceptable, including adjusting tool settings to re-scan missed areas or repairing damaged components. ** Most robotic tools employ non-contact examination methods – technicians are not forced to manage a layer of couplant. * Limited tool access may impact use of traditional tools – smart pigs require special entry and exit points (called launchers and receivers, respectively), which may be permanently or temporarily installed. ** Some crawlers can be inserted via removed fittings or cut-out spools as small as 24” in length, providing greater flexibility in launch and retrieval options – these tools do not require special fixtures. ** Some crawlers are designed to enter and exit natural gas lines via hot taps, which can be placed at pipeline operator convenience without taking the line out of service. ** Even in pipelines that could feasibly accept a traditional smart pig, the ability of crawlers to perform short inspections inside specific areas of concern is much more efficient for pipeline operators than arranging a lengthy pig run just to reach the same small area. Robotic NDT tools also offer safety advantages in inhospitable areas: * Tank shell inspection crawlers typically climb the sides of the tanks, avoiding the danger to the inspectors and time/expense to the tank owner of providing fall protection or/and scaffolding. * Similarly, tank floor inspection crawlers that can be lowered into the tank via portholes on the tank roof eliminate the hazards of confined space entry and the time/expense involved in air quality monitoring. * Tools capable of working while submerged eliminate the hazards, difficulty, and expense of draining the inspection area. When used in storage tank inspections and subsea applications, these tools also eliminate hazards associated with diving.  Robotic ILI crawler variants  = Tethered tool overview = A tethered pipeline ILI crawler manufactured and operated by Diakont. Technicians use the socket on the front of this crawler to attach modules using different inspection technologies; this crawler is shown with an EMAT inspection module. Tethered robotic inspection tools have an umbilical cable attached to them, which provides power and control commands to the tool while relaying sensor data back to the technician. Tethered crawlers have the following advantages over untethered crawlers: * Technicians can use the tether to help retrieve the crawler in an emergency or to perform repairs * Unlimited power supply from the umbilical cable allows technicians to examine potential defects as necessary without concern for battery life * The umbilical cable supplies real-time control and sensor data to technicians, allowing re-inspection of questionable findings if necessary as well as alerting technicians immediately to tool malfunctions (i.e., minimizing false calls or/and missed anomalies) * Most tethered ILI crawlers are small enough to be inserted via removed fittings/flanges or small cuts in a pipeline, minimizing inconvenience to the pipeline operator * Bi-directional capabilities require only one access point for pipe inspections Tethered crawlers have the following disadvantages against untethered crawlers: * The length and weight of the umbilical cable limits the distance these tools can travel * Pipelines and tanks typically must be taken out of service to accommodate ILI tool entry and travel = Untethered ILI crawler overview = Pipetel Explorer untethered NDT pipeline crawler, manufactured and operated by Pipetel Technologies. Untethered robotic ILI crawlers are powered by onboard batteries; these tools transmit sensor data wirelessly to the tool operator or store the data for downloading upon tool retrieval. Untethered crawlers have the following advantages over tethered crawlers: * Untethered tools have a greater effective distance without the limitations imposed by an umbilical cable * Pipelines can be sealed with untethered tools inside – the pipe can often remain in service during the inspection * Bi-directional capabilities require only one access point for pipe inspections Untethered crawlers have the following disadvantages against tethered crawlers: * Untethered robotic ILI crawlers can get stuck, requiring excavation and pipe cutting to retrieve the tool * Data-recording robotic ILI crawlers do not supply real time data to operators, which can require additional inspection runs to analyze possible findings * Untethered robotic ILI crawlers typically require large launchers to deploy and retrieve  Inspection technologies  Robotic NDT tools employ suites of inspection sensors. This section describes common sensor types; most tools combine several types of sensor depending on factors such as robot size, design, and application. = Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers (EMAT) – milled steel = Main article – Electromagnetic acoustic transducers A transducer uses the direct beam method to discover anomalies in a pipe wall; the pink arrows represent the ultrasonic waves. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT) induce ultrasonic waves into uniformly-milled metal inspection objects (e.g., pipe walls, tank floors). Technicians can assess metal condition and detect anomalies based on the reflections of these waves – when the transducer passes over an anomaly, a new reflection appears between the initial pulse and the normal reflection.Ultrasonic Testing. The Hashemite University NDT Center. Accessed 2 March 2016. Direct beam EMAT, where the tool induces ultrasonic waves into the metal at a 0° angle (or perpendicular to the metal surface), is the most common inspection method. Direct beam inspections determine metal thickness as well as detect and measure the following defects: * Metal loss on the internal surface (e.g., pitting corrosion, general metal loss) * Metal loss on the external surface (e.g., pitting corrosion, gouges), including a residual thickness measurement in defect areas * Mid-wall pipe mill anomalies (e.g., laminations, non-metal inclusions), including depth measurement A tool uses the angle beam method to discover a crack in a pipe wall; the solid arrow represents the original ultrasonic wave (created at an angle relative to the pipe radius) and the dotted arrow represents the wave reflected back to the tool from the crack. Angle beam inspections, where the tool induces ultrasonic waves into the metal at an angle relative to the metal surface, can be performed concurrently with direct beam inspections to confirm anomaly detections. An angle beam transducer only registers echoes from anomalies or reflectors that fall into the beam path; unlike direct beam, it does not receive reflections from the opposite wall of normal steel. The combination of angle beam and direct beam methods may find additional anomalies and increase inspection accuracy. However, the angle beam method has a lower tolerance for surface debris than the direct beam method. Angle beam inspections discover crack-like anomalies parallel to the pipe axis and metal loss defects that are too small to detect via direct beam, including the following: * Stress corrosion cracking * Mechanical damage (e.g., scores, feed marks, scratches) * Pitting corrosion Besides its uses in unpiggable pipelines, the non-contact nature of EMAT tools makes this method ideal for dry applications where liquid couplant requirements may make traditional UT tools undesirable (e.g., natural gas lines). = EMAT – girth welds = Weld integrity is a crucial component of pipeline safety, especially girth welds (or the circumferential welds that join each section of pipe together). However, unlike the consistent molecular structure of milled steel, welds and their heat-affected zones (HAZs) have an anisotropic grain structure that attenuates ultrasonic signals and creates wave velocity variances that are difficult for ILI tools to analyze. One angle-beam EMAT method employs a set of nine frequency-time (FT) scans on each side of the girth weld, where each frequency corresponds to a different input wave angle.In-Line Inspection Technology to Detect, Locate, and Measure Pipeline Girth Weld Defects. California Energy Commission, 2015. Web. Accessed 1 March 2016.

The principle of angle-beam EMAT use in pipeline girth weld assessment. The frequency-time matrix for a lateral cylindrical hole in a pipe. The tool merges each set of FT scans into a single frequency-time matrix scan to display weld conditions, with anomalies color-coded by severity. This method of girth weld scanning is designed to detect the following weld defects: * Planar defects (e.g., lack of fusion, cracks) * Volumetric defects (e.g., porosity, nonmetallic inclusions) = Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) = Main article – Magnetic flux leakage Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) tools use a sensor sandwiched between multiple powerful magnets to create and measure the flow of magnetic flux in the pipe wall. Structurally-sound steel has a uniform structure that allows regular flow of the magnetic flux, while anomalies and features interrupt the flow of flux in identifiable patterns; the sensor registers these flow interruptions and records them for later analysis. The following figure illustrates the principle of a typical MFL inspection tool; the left side of the diagram shows how an MFL tool works in structurally sound pipe, while the right side shows how the tool detects and measures a metal loss defect.de Raad, J.A., and J.H.J. Stalenhoef. MFL and PEC Tools for Plant Inspection. December 1998. Web. Accessed 1 March 2016. The principle of a typical MFL pipeline inspection tool. MFL tools are used primarily to detect pitting corrosion, and some tool configurations can detect weld defects. One advantage of MFL tools over ultrasonic tools is the ability to maintain reasonable sensitivity through relatively thick surface coatings (e.g., paint, pipe liners).Drury, J.C, and A. Marino.

Accessed 1 March 2016. = Video inspection = A high-resolution camera image of an internal corrosion pit in a pipe wall. Main article – video inspection Robotic NDT tools employ cameras to provide technicians an optimal view of the inspection area. Some cameras provide specific views of the pipeline (e.g., straight forward, sensor contact area on the metal) to assist in controlling the tool, while other cameras are used to take high-resolution photographs of inspection findings. Some tools exist solely to perform video inspection; many of these tools include a mechanism to aim the camera to completely optimize technicians’ field of vision, and the lack of other bulky ILI sensor packages makes these tools exceptionally maneuverable. Cameras on multipurpose ILI tools are usually placed in locations that maximize technicians’ ability to analyze findings as well as optimally control the tool. = Laser profilometry = Laser profilometry assessment of the pipe wall corrosion pit shown in the previous image. Main article – surface metrology Laser profilometers project a shape onto the object surface. Technicians configure the laser (both angle of incidence and distance from the object) to ensure the shape is uniform on normal metal. Superficial anomalies (e.g., pitting corrosion, dents) distort the shape, allowing the inspection technicians to measure the anomalies using proprietary software programs. Photographs of these laser distortions provide visual evidence that improves the data analysis process and contributes to structural integrity efforts. = Pulsed-Eddy Current (PEC) = Main article – Pulsed-eddy current Pulsed-eddy current (PEC) tools use a probe coil to send a pulsed magnetic field into a metal object. The varying magnetic field induces eddy currents on the metal surface. The tool processes the detected eddy current signal and compares it to a reference signal set before the tool run; the material properties are eliminated to give a reading for the average wall thickness within the area covered by the magnetic field. The tool logs the signal for later analysis.Robers, M.A. and R. Scottini. Pulsed Eddy Current in Corrosion Detection. June 2002. Web. Accessed 2 March 2016. The following diagram illustrates the principle of a typical PEC inspection tool. PEC tool operating principle. PEC tools can inspect accurately with a larger gap between the transducer and the inspection object than other tools, making it ideal for inspecting metal through non-metal substances (e.g., pipe coatings, insulation, marine growth).  Case studies  United States federal law requires baseline inspections to establish pipeline as-built statistics and subsequent periodic inspections to monitor asset deterioration. Pipeline operators also are responsible to designate high-consequence areas (HCAs) in all pipelines, perform regular assessments to monitor pipeline conditions, and develop preventive actions and response plans.Pipeline Safety: Pipeline Integrity Management in High Consequence Areas (Gas Transmission Pipelines). Research and Special Programs Administration, 2003. Web. Accessed 1 March 2016. State regulations for inspecting pipelines vary based on the level of public safety concerns. For example, a 2010 natural gas pipeline explosion in a San Bruno residential neighborhood led the California Public Utilities Commission to require safety enhancement plans from California natural gas transmission operators.Ng, Deana Michelle and Sharon L. Tomkins. Amended Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan of Southern California Gas Company (U 904-G) and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-M) Pursuant to D.11-06-017, Requiring All California Natural Gas Transmission Operators to File a Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Comprehensive Pressure Testing Implementation Plan. December 2, 2011. Web. Accessed 9 March 2016. The safety plan included numerous pipeline replacements and in-line inspections. = Tethered robotic ILI crawler application examples = The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) does not permit use of tetherless crawlers in HCAs due to the risk of getting stuck. Excavating buried pipelines to retrieve stuck tools beneath freeway crossings, river crossings or dense urban areas would impact the community infrastructure too greatly. Natural gas and oil pipeline operators therefore rely on tethered robotic ILI crawlers to inspect unpiggable pipelines. Williams used a tethered robotic ILI crawler to inspect an unpiggable section of the Transco Pipeline in New Jersey in 2015.Robotic Crawlers Inspect Unpiggable Gas Pipelines in Urban Area. North American Oil & Gas Pipelines. September 29, 2015. Web. Accessed 9 March 2016. The pipeline system ran beneath the Hudson River; construction of a new condominium development nearby created a new HCA, requiring Williams to create an integrity management program per PHMSA regulations. Alyeska Pipeline Service Company inspected Pump Station 3 on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System after an oil leak was discovered in an underground oil pipeline at Pump Station 1 in 2011.DeMarban, Alex. Crawling robot patrols Alaska pipeline’s formerly ‘unpiggable’ lines. July 5, 2015. Web. Accessed 9 March 2016. The spill resulted in a consent agreement between Alyeska and PHMSA requiring Alyeska to remove all liquid-transport piping from its system that could not be assessed using ILI tools or a similar suitable inspection technique. Because other ILI tools could not navigate the pipeline geometry common to each of the eleven pump stations along the pipeline, Alyeska received approval to use a tethered robotic ILI crawler manufactured by Diakont to complete an inspection project at Pump Station 3. This tool allowed Alyeska to only remove a few small aboveground fittings to permit crawler entry into the piping, saving the time and expense necessary to excavate hundreds of feet of pipe (some of which was also encased in concrete vaults) to inspect by hand. Nuclear power plants in the United States are subject to unique integrity management mandates per the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) NEI 09-14, Guideline for the Management of Buried Piping Integrity. * The Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska performed buried pipe inspections to comply with these industry mandates as part of a 2010 nuclear power plant license renewal. Part of the plant pipeline integrity management program included inspecting a high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) line using a tethered robotic ILI crawler manufactured by Diakont.Bremer, David.

NDT method comparison  Robotic NDT tools have the following advantages over other NDT methods: * Real-time data analysis makes structural integrity efforts more effective and convenient. ** Faster preliminary results make structural integrity management more efficient – results from a smart pig are not available until the tool run is complete and may take up to 90 days to analyze, whereas the shorter inspection scope and close real-time monitoring allow robotic tool results to be formally reported in as little as 30 days. ** Robotic tools inspections can include an immediate reporting threshold. *** Crews can use the separate reporting thresholds to better prioritize findings. *** The ability to stop the tool and alert customer engineers to the most serious findings helps expedite structural integrity efforts. ** Continuous monitoring allows for tool repair or/and inspection scope adjustment to prevent the cost/inconvenience of a whole repeat tool run. *** Real-time data monitoring allows daily reports and makes a preliminary report (containing only the most serious anomalies) possible. *** The inspection crew can stop the tool’s forward progress to re-examine findings in order to gather additional data and confirm defect identity/severity. *** The ability to monitor tool function ensures tool data integrity for the entirety of the inspection. * The compact footprint of these tools allows them to be deployed at customer convenience rather than limited to pre-established endpoints (i.e., pig launcher/receiver). ** This makes tethered tools less likely to get stuck, and easier to retrieve if stuck/damaged. ** Pipeline operators can enjoy major savings on excavation costs when examining underground installations, especially if the tool run can be coordinated with an existing excavation during other maintenance efforts. ** The smaller space requirements make robotic NDT crawlers much easier to use in urban environments and other cramped settings where pedestrians, vehicular traffic, and/or other workers are present. * Robotic NDT tools are specifically designed to navigate more complex environments. ** The inspection crew can adapt tool travel to accommodate fixtures (e.g., tees, bends, tank roof supports) as well as findings (e.g., dents, corrosion pits) to prevent the tool from becoming damaged or stuck. ** The inspection crew can also manipulate the tool to maximize sensor reception in areas where the tool’s normal travel path would impact readings. * Many inspection areas pose significant safety hazards to human occupants that can be eliminated or greatly reduced by robotic NDT tools: ** The modest entry requirements and remote operation of pipeline inspection crawlers minimizes hazards associated with working in trenches. ** Robotic inspection inside liquid tanks eliminates the hazards associated with working in confined spaces, especially if the tank contents include dangerous fumes. ** Robotic inspection of tank shells eliminates the need for fall protection and the dangers involved with working at significant heights. * The cost of an outage for an inspection (and planned maintenance, if necessary) is a fraction of the costs involved in an asset failure. Robotic tools have the following disadvantages against other NDT methods: * The need for the inspection crew to maintain communication with the tool limits its effective range. ** Tethered tools may also be limited by the crawler’s ability to pull the tether over long distances. ** Tension on a tethered crawler’s cable may limit tool movement after passing too many bends in pipeline applications, or after wrapping around roof supports during tank floor inspections. * Many self-propelled pipeline inspection tools are slower than pigs that can flow with product. * Unlike some remote-control vehicles that are commercially available for rent or sale, robotic NDT crawlers require significant training before they can be used for formal inspection. ** Regulatory requirements often specify that inspection data must be gathered, analyzed, and collated for reporting by technicians who are certified as experts in the applicable inspection technology by an independent organization (e.g., the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers). * Many crawlers require the inspection area to be taken out of service and cleaned before operations. ** Continuous air-quality monitoring may be necessary during operations, up to provision of a blanket of inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) if the area contains especially flammable/explosive fumes. ** Loose debris (e.g., ferromagnetic dust, paraffin) or internal corrosion can impact EMAT and MFL readings. ** These services can often be performed during scheduled outages, but special shut-down may be necessary if regulatory requirements do not align with other planned service outages.

From an early age, she loved to sing; however, her voice was frequently mocked during her elementary years. Due to bullying, she stopped going to school after her first semester of middle school. After listening to the music of Akina Nakamori, she regained confidence, and after her original school merged with another school, she eventually resumed her schooling. While she was studying in a high school in Sapporo, she attended the P's Voice Artist School in Hokkaido, and she worked part-time to support her studies. She also became interested in anime music and decided that she wanted to become an anison singer. At the urging of her family and friends, she decided to participate in an audition held by the talent agency Horipro and record label Pony Canyon. Although she passed the initial screening, she nearly decided to withdraw from the competition, as the final judging was to be held in Tokyo and Osaka, which were far from Hokkaido. With the support of her father, she decided to push through with her application, and she went on to win the audition grand prize, beating more than 10,000 other applicants. Following her winning the audition, she was offered a contract with Pony Canyon. Wajima made her major debut in May 2016 with the release of her first single , the title track of which was used as the opening theme to the anime television series The Lost Village; the single peaked at number 43 on the Oricon weekly charts.

They owned estates and castles on both sides of the Alps in the modern cantons of St. Gallen, Graubünden and Ticino. The origin of the family is unknown, but they probably stem from Churrätien nobility and were related to the da Torre family. The family divided into two main lines; the Grafen von Sax-Misox and the Freiherren von Hohensax.  Origins  The earliest mention of a member of the family is in 1137/39 with Eberhard de Sacco. In 1168, they were granted a fief over the Misox valley, probably as a reward for their support of the Hohenstaufen family. The founder of the line was Albrecht of Sax who first appears in a record in 1188. His brother, Heinrich reorganized the administration of the Abbey of St. Gall and brought it under their authority. Albrecht's sons, Ulrich (first mentioned 1204, died 23 September 1220) and Heinrich (born around 1180, last mentioned 31 March 1247) became the abbot and vogt, respectively, over the Abbey of St. Gall. Between 1208 and 1213 they became vogts over Disentis and Pfäfers Abbeys. In 1212 they supported Frederick II in his bid to become Emperor and gained extensive land and wealth from him. To protect their expansive holdings, the family built Clanx Castle in Appenzell, Hohensax Castle in Sennwald and Mesocco Castle in Mesocco in Graubünden. In 1220, they expanded their southern holdings into the Leventina and Blenio Valleys. The next 28 years marked a high point in the family's power. In 1248, the family holdings were divided between two of Heinrich's grandsons. The southern holdings in Graubünden and Ticino as well as Clanx Castle and Pfäfers Abbey were inherited by Heinrich (first mention 1235, last mention 1258) and Albrecht (first mention 1236, last mention 1275), who became the heads of the Sax-Misox line. The northern estates around Hohensax and St. Gallen were inherited by Ulrich (first mention 1236, last mention 1257) who founded the Hohensax line.  Sax-Misox  Arms of the counts of Sax-Misox in Cathedral of Chur. In 1257 Albrecht of Sax-Misox sold Wartenstein Castle and the villages of Pfäfers, Valens, Vättis and Untervaz to Pfäfers Abbey for 300 silver marks.Act in Stiftsarchiv St. Gallen, StiAPf, Urk 1257 After the decline of the imperial Hohenstaufen family the Sax-Misox lost the Blenio Valley, Monte Dongo and Clanx Castle. Their lands were reduced to the Core of the Misox Valley with the San Bernardino Pass and the Walser settlements in the Rheinwald Valley. The distant estate at Arth was granted as a fief to Heinrich and Albrecht von Grünenfels in 1295.The story of Arth, Arth-online.ch Caspar of Sax-Misox (1362–90) married Elizabeth of Rhäzüns and after her grandfather died in 1380, inherited the land of the Barons of Belmont including Flims with the Belmont Castle, Fidaz, Gruob, Ilanz, Lugnez, Vals and Wartau. Wartau village was later sold to the Count of Werdenberg. Caspar and Elizabeth's son, Johann von Sax-Misox (1390–1427) was initially in service to the Visconti family who were the Dukes of Milan. However, in 1402 he and his brother Albert (1390–1406) acquired the Milanese city of Bellinzona. They built castles in Gorduno, Bogiano and Roveredo to protect their conquests. A few years later, in 1406–7, they were forced to accept co-ownership of Bellinzona with Uri and Obwalden. In 1406 Albert of Sax was murdered by a distant cousin at the Torre Fiorenzana near Grono, possibly to gain favor with the Dukes of Milan. In 1413 Johann and another brother, Donat (mentioned 1400–23), supported Emperor Sigismund during his campaigns against the Venetians in Italy and were rewarded with the title of count and the right to mint coins. In 1419 they sold Bellinzona to Uri and Obwalden. When the Confederates attacked Milan in 1425, Johann remained neutral. On 14 February 1395, the three main nobles (the abbot of Disentis, Johannes von Ilanz, Baron Ulrich II von Rhäzüns and Baron Albrecht von Sax-Misox) of the Vorderrhein together with delegates from the Court Municipalities in Ilanz created an \\"eternal alliance\\". Since the alliance was predominantly located in the high country, it was also known as Part Sura ( or High Alliance). Five days later, Count Johann von Werdenberg-Sargans joined the League at Flimserwald. On 16 March 1424, the leaders, including Johann of Sax-Misox, of the alliance met under a legendary maple tree in Trun to reaffirm and expand it into the Grey League. Johann married Catherine of Werdenberg-Heiligenberg, the co-heiress with the last Count of Toggenburg, Frederick VII. After Frederick's death in 1436, the Sax-Misox family was one of the claimants to the Toggenburg lands, which led to the Old Zürich War in 1440. Johann's son Count Heinrich of Sax-Misox (around 1418–last mention 1479) fought to receive the Toggenburg inheritance of his mother Catherine. However, in 1437 one of the castles he claimed, Grinau Castle was given to Schwyz and in 1439 he mortgaged his claim on the county of Uznach to Schwyz and Glarus. He was part of the Confederate army which attacked the Golden Ambrosian Republic in Milan and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Castione on 6 June 1449. By the following year, he was reconciled again with the Duke of Milan. In 1458, when he was preparing to conclude an alliance with Milan, there was an uprising in the Grey League, which was settled amicably thanks to the mediation of the abbot of Disentis. In 1479 he was party to a peace treaty signed by the Swiss Confederation and the Duchy of Milan. In the same year he abdicated and gave his lands to his son Johann-Peter. Johann Peter (1462–1540) was the last Count of Sax-Misox. He fought numerous incursions into his lands by the Confederation, Milan and the cadet line of Sax-Grono. As Milan the still occupied the Misox valley, he sold it in 1480 to the Milanese commander Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. Three years later he sold the estates in the high valleys of Graubünden. Through his second marriage with the Countess Clementine from Montfort-Werdenberg, Johann Peter gained the county of Werdenberg and Wartau in 1483. Short of money he sold Werdenberg and Wartau and to the city of Lucerne in 1485. Impoverished, he entered the service of the Dukes of Austria and Milan. He died in Castrisch and was buried in the local church. A number of cadet branches of the Sax-Misox line came into being in the 13th century including Sax-Grono, Sax-Palazio and Sax-Norantola. Hohensax The political situation in eastern Switzerland during the Old Confederation (before 1798) During the 14th century, the Hohensax family allied closely with the Austrian Habsburgs. One of the first Ulrich of Hohensax decedents, also named Ulrich was an Austrian commander and died at the Battle of Näfels in 1388. By 1393 Hohensax Castle was an Austrian fief. The Appenzell Wars (1401–29) allowed Ulrich Eberhard the Younger (mentioned 1384–1414) and his wife Elizabeth of Werdenberg-Sargans to gain independence from the Habsburgs. By supporting Appenzell's revolt, their castles were not destroyed and they were able to sign treaties with the victorious Appenzellers. His sons Rudolf and Gerold were both abbots of Einsiedeln in 1438–47 and 1452–69 respectively. As the only male heir, Albert I of Hohensax (1439–1463) inherited all the estates of the entire Hohensax family line. He was also able to gain some financial security by marrying Ursula Mötteli. After his death, his sister inherited Hohensax and Frischenberg Castles along with the associated villages of Gams and Sax. Elisabeth of Hohensax was married to Kaspar of Bonstetten, a citizen of Zurich, so during the Old Zurich War the Appenzellers attacked and burned both castles. In the peace treaty they returned the ruins of Hohensax and the village of Gams, but retained Frischenberg Castle and the village of Sax. The son of Albert and Ursula, Ulrich of Hohensax (1463–1538) consolidated the family lands in the Rhine valley and the Thurgau and was the mayor of Zurich. During the Burgundian Wars, he fought on the side of Zurich and was knighted. Between 1487 and 1497 he was a condottieri or mercenary leader in Habsburg service. However, two years later, in 1499 he fought in the Battle of Frastanz of the Swabian War on the side of the Swiss Confederation. In the following years, 1501 and 1503, he served as imperial envoy in the Confederation. At the same time, in 1503, he represented the Confederation in the negotiations that lead to the Treaty of Arona which helped fix the Swiss southern border. Over the next two decades he was a soldier and diplomat for the Holy Roman Emperor, the Confederation and the French. In 1529 he embraced the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and spread it throughout his lands. However, in 1531 he abandoned his new faith and returned to the Catholic faith. His son Ulrich Philipp (1531–85) followed in his father's footsteps and served in both Imperial and French armies. He embraced the Reformed faith in 1564 and converted the Hohensax lands back to the Reformation. After his death in 1585, the family fortunes began to decline. Johann Albrecht (1545–1597) killed Governor Georg Trösch of Sargans in a brawlsee. Mathias Bugg: From a Fryherren of Sax zuo Sangans entlybt ...: the homicide Trösch Hohensax in 1580 in Sargans. In: Werdenberger Yearbook 2006, pg. 47–51. 2006. and fled to Spain, spending over 15 years in Spanish military service. Johann Philipp of Hohensax (1553–96) served in the Palatinate and in the Netherlands and was the governor of Geldern in 1578. During his travels, he acquired the Codex Manesse, the single most comprehensive source of Middle High German Minnesang poetry, written and illustrated between ca. 1304 and 1340. He got into a dispute over inheritance with his brother Johann Albrecht, whose son Georg Ulrich 1596 mortally wounded him in Salez. His body was in 1730 found incorrupt in the family vault in Sennwald, where it was exhibited until the 1970s as a \\"mummy of Sennwald\\". Friedrich Ludwig (1589–1629), son of Johann Philipp, sold in 1615 two thirds of the County of Sax-Forstegg to Zurich. The last of the family of the Hohensax, Christoph Friedrich (1620–1633), also sold the rest of the Sax-Forstegg County to Zurich. He died in 1633 at Burg Uster. In popular culture The Swiss writer Adolf Muschg's novel Sax (2010) is based on the family history of the Hohensax. References Sources * * Historisch- Bibliographisches Lexikon der Schweiz.

The Chandela inscriptions mention his title as kśitipa (\\"lord of the country\\"). Vakpati is known from two inscriptions found at Khajuraho, dated Vikrama Samvat 1011 (954 CE) and 1059 (1002 CE). He succeeded his father Nannuka as the Chandela ruler. The eulogistic inscriptions describe him as a king famous for his bravery, modesty and knowledge. The inscriptions claim that he defeated several enemies and was a favourite of his subjects. The inscriptions compare him to his namesake Bṛhaspati, the deity of speech, for his wisdom and power of speech. They further state that he surpassed the legendary kings such as Prithu and Kakutstha in combining bravery with wisdom. An inscription dated to 954 CE states that the \\"pleasure mountain\\" (krida-giri) of Vakpati was the Vindhya mountain, where the Kirata women seated on lotuses sang songs about him, as peacocks danced to the sound of waterfalls. According to R. C. Majumdar, Vakpati might have supported the southern expansion of Devapala, the Pala king of eastern India. Vakpati had two sons: Jayashakti (Jeja) and Vijayashakti (Vija).

Scheduled for launch in October 2024, Artemis 3 is planned to be the second crewed mission of the Artemis program and the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17 in 1972. Mission Artemis 3 will land a crew at the Moon's south polar region. It is planned to have two astronauts on the surface of the Moon for about one week. The mission is intended to be the first to place a woman on the Moon. While up to four astronauts would leave Earth on board Orion, the surface mission with the HLS (Human Landing System - see below) will consist of two crew members, who will remain on the surface for 6.5 days. The remaining astronauts will stay on board the Gateway / Orion orbital complex. The two astronauts will conduct up to four spacewalks on the surface of the Moon, performing a variety of scientific observations, including sampling water ice. Before the Artemis 3 landing, some additional equipment will be pre-positioned on the surface, including an unpressurized rover for astronauts to use during their spacewalks. This rover will have the capability to be controlled remotely. Several permanently shadowed regions could be reached by short forays of , well within the range of the unpressurized rover. Spacecraft In May 2019, NASA selected eleven companies to produce studies of a multi-element landing system that would be staged on the Lunar Gateway previous to the docking of the Artemis 3 crew. These are termed \\"transfer element\\" (to low-lunar orbit), the \\"descent element\\" to take the crew down to the Moon's surface, and an \\"ascent element\\" that would take them back to the Gateway. After Artemis 3, it is intended to make these systems reusable through refueling. In April of 2020, the US companies were selected to develop lunar landers for the Artemis Program. Blue Origin's Integrated Lander Vehicle, Dynetics' ALPACA, and SpaceX's Starship were selected for development. Development Upon the December 2017 ratification of the Trump administration's Space Policy Directive 1, a crewed lunar campaign – later known as the Artemis program – utilising the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and a space station in lunar orbit was established. Originally billed as Exploration Mission-3 (EM-3), the goal of the mission was to send four astronauts into a near- rectilinear halo orbit around the Moon and deliver the ESPRIT and U.S. Utilization Module to the lunar space station, known as the Gateway. By May 2019 however, ESPRIT and the U.S. Utilization Module – now called HALO – were re-manifested to fly separately on a commercial launch vehicle instead. Artemis 3, as it was now billed, was repurposed to accelerate the first crewed lunar landing of the Artemis program by the end of 2024, with a profile that would've seen the Orion MPCV rendezvous with a minimal Gateway made up of only the Power and Propulsion Element and a small habitat/docking node with an attached commercially-procured lunar lander known as the Human Landing System. By early 2020, plans for Orion and the HLS to rendezvous with the Gateway were abandoned in favour of a solo demonstration of Orion and HLS, and development of the Gateway independent of the Artemis program.

Life Little is known about Johann Adam's early years and his birth year is an estimate. In 1733, he was listed as a Jagdpfeiffer at the Royal court in Dresden. In 1737 he was transferred to the Hofkapelle as a violist with a yearly salary of 400 thaler. From around 1740, he was also well known as a composer of ballet music which was played during operas, particularly those of Hasse, and from 1763 to 1769, he was employed as the director and composer of the Elector's French Theater. In 1775, Charles Burney said of him: \\"Mr. Adam, a veteran musicien, one of the few remaining performers in the celebrated opera-band, under the direction of Signor Hasse, has established himself a great reputation by his composition of the music to the dances performed at this opera in its most flourishing state\\".

An ultra-cool dwarf is a stellar or sub-stellar object of spectral class M that has an effective temperature under . TRAPPIST-1 is one of the best known examples of an ultra-cool dwarf star. The category of ultra-cool dwarf stars was introduced in 1997 by J. Davy Kirkpatrick, Todd J. Henry, and Michael J. Irwin. Today it includes very low mass M-dwarf stars with spectral types of M7 and later, and extends beyond the coolest stars to brown dwarfs as cool as spectral type T6.5. Together, they represent about 15% of astronomical objects in the stellar neighborhood of the Sun. Models of the formation of planets suggest that due to their low masses and the small size of their proto- planetary disks, these stars could host a relatively abundant population of Earth-like planets ranging from Mercury-size to Earth-size instead of super- Earths and Jupiter-massed planets. The discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system of seven Earth-like planets seems to validate this accretion model. Due to their slow hydrogen fusion compared to other types of low mass stars their life spans are estimated at several hundred billion years, with the smallest living for a few trillion years. As the age of the universe is only 13.8 billion years, all ultra-cool dwarf stars are relatively young. Models predict that at the ends of their lives the smallest of these stars will become blue dwarfs instead of expanding into red giants. Magnetic properties After the detection of bursts of radio emission from the M9 ultracool dwarf LP 944-20 in 2001, a number of astrophysicists began observing programs at the Arecibo Observatory and the Very Large Array to search for additional objects that emit radio waves. To date hundreds of ultracool dwarfs have been observed with these radio telescopes and over a dozen such radio-emitting ultracool dwarfs have been found. These surveys indicate that approximately 5-10% of ultracool dwarfs emit radio waves. Among the more noteworthy, 2MASS J10475385+2124234, with a temperature of 800-900 K, is the coolest known radio-emitting brown dwarf. It is a T6.5 brown dwarf that retains a magnetic field with a strength larger than 1.7 kG, making it some 3000 times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field.

She went on to talk about her premise behind the book: > “There is no pursuit which fills the mind with more noble and exalted > sentiments than the study of these works of Nature. To her own sex, to whose > particular notice she offers it, she trusts it may prove a useful and > correct guide to their tastes, both in their selection for a flower garden, > and as objects for their pencil.” Roscoe died in 1840. A memorial sculpture commemorating Roscoe and her husband was undertaken by sculptor John Gibson. This monument can be seen at the Ullet Road Unitarian Church in Liverpool.

(2011), Housing Law and Policy Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp 68-69 Local authorities can only apply for a Rent Repayment Order where occupiers pay their rent with the assistance of housing benefit.Denton-Ashly, G. (2013) Being a Landlord, Spiramus Press, p. 96 The Housing and Planning Act 2016 has changed when Rent Repayment Orders can be granted to include the following situations: *Breaches of improvement orders and prohibition notices and of licensing requirements under the Housing Act 2004.http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/BPF-brief- Housing-Planning-Bill-2015.pdf *Violent entry under the Criminal Law Act 1977. *Unlawful eviction under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. *Breach of Banning Orders (new in this Act). In addition, tenants under the new Act can apply for a RRO directly without the need for a prior conviction of the landlord through a prosecution by a Local Authority (LA). LAs have (prior to 2016 Act) prosecuted on average only one landlord per year for such offences.https://www.nationalrentersalliance.co.uk/news/housing-standards/446/ LAs have the power to impose unlimited fines or bring criminal charges. Fines for the above offences may be kept by the LA to fund enforcement in these areas. There has been considerable variation in the awards received by tenants making RRO applications under the 2016 Housing and Planning Act and there is some discussion regarding the use of guidance given by the Upper Tribunal under the 2004 Housing Act for making judgments under the new Act. A discussion of recent actual cases of tenant-instigated RRO applications, for the London area, can be found here. Recent articles suggest RROs are becoming a powerful tool for tenants to gain redress for sub-standard accommodation. Application Form RRO1 On 10 January 2019 the President of the London First- tier Tribunal, Siobhan McGrath, announced that the form used for applications for RROs (RRO1) would be corrected. The following words will be removed from the form: \\"The Tribunal is not permitted to order payment of any amount in respect of any time falling outside the period of 12 months ending with the date of this application\\". This followed a letter to the FtT by Flat Justice Community Interest Company pointing out the mistake. This is a significant move that will encourage more applicants: giving them more time to make RRO applications and the potential to recover more rent. The above correction of the RRO1 form and the interpretation of the timing of RRO applications has now been confirmed in an appeal case brought by Flat Justice CIC and decided 15/5/2019. RRO1 was updated 6/11/2019 and contained the new requirement that Applicants submit a copy of their written tenancy agreement with the form. Flat Justice wrote to the London FtT pointing out that many tenants do not have a written agreement and that the form should be amended to allow for this. It is not even a legal requirement for landlords to issue a written agreement. 2/12/2019 the President of the Tribunal agreed to have the form amended accordingly: \\"The form has now been amended so it makes it clearer that any written agreement can be enclosed with the form. In the absence of any written agreement, we have added a box where they can supply details of what has been agreed. \\" Case Law Taylor v Mina An Ltd (2019) The Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) (UT) has overturned a decision of the FtT which would have allowed the licence of sold property to continue in force under the new owner, even though the HA 2004 clearly states that a licence is not transferable. Had the decision stood, then RROs for such properties would not have been possible. Sharma & Subramani v Chun Kwok Lau (2019) This case, reviewed on appeal at FtT, confirms that you can make your application within 12 months of the offence and that the rent you can apply for is not reduced by any delay (see RRO1 form correction above). Additionally, you do not need to specify the exact period of rent that you apply for. Goldsbrough & Swart v CA Property Management Ltd. (2019) Applicants can choose who is their landlord/Respondent in cases where there is ambiguity, e.g. Rent-to-Rent schemes Guardians can Get Rent Back A recent decision of The London Property Tribunal found that guardians were able to use Rent Repayment Order (RRO) legislation to apply for their rent to be repaid when the property was not licensed as a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO). Opara v Olasemo (2020) Refinement of the definition of \\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\\". This is the \\"criminal\\" level of evidence required to assure the possibility of a RRO award by the FtT and this appeal challenged the finding that any doubt at all meant that an application must fail. The UT found that the FtT had been \\"irrational\\" in its conclusion that the existence of any possibility of any doubt prohibited a RRO.

The area contains settlements ranging from the Bronze Age (20th-16th century BC) to the Roman period.  History  Archaeological evidence allows the phases of habitation to be divided as follows: *23rd-15th century BC: some villages of the Castelluccio culture *13th-10th century BC: village of huts of the northern Pantalica culture (threephases) *10th-9th century BC: slight habitation by the Cassibile culture *8th-7th century BC: new settlement with rectangular houses and an organised religious area *6th-4th century BC: settlement of Greek colonists from Gela. The original village has securely pre-Greek origins, it was constructed by the Sicans, who took advantage of the dominant position of the mountain over the Salso river valley. = Greek period = The first phase of the Greek settlement came in the 7th century. The centre consisted of rectangular habitations, with more space between them towards the summit of the mountain. In the 6th century BC, the city wall was built, which probably contained the entire inhabited area at that time. In the 5th century the settlement was destroyed, probably by Ducetius, who is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus. Reconstruction occurred in the second half of the century; the settlement received a new layout of streets and housing plots on a different orientation, and a new city wall with rectangular towers. This settlement was abandoned in turn at the end of the fourth century, probably as a result of the Agathocles of Syracuse..  Archaeological area  In the area at the bottom of the mountain are some Bronze Age ; other important discoveries include to a hut used as a shrine and the so-called , a terracotta model dating to the 6th century BC, found in the area of the necropolis, which depicts a small temple with a pronaos in antis and a pitched roof surmounted by two figures of cavalrymen and two gorgoneion masks decorating the tympanum. The sacello, with other discoveries, is now kept in the Regional archaeological museum of Caltanissetta. The discovery of this archaeological site is relatively recent; the first excavations only took place in the 1960s, when Piero Orlandini excavated the late Bronze Age huts, dating to the 13th-10th centuries BC. This was an important excavation, since Sabucina was the first village of this type to be identified in Sicily. Today the site is accessible, thanks to a regulation of the Office of Cultural Heritage. As a result of public order n.6262 on 11 July 2001 it became the regional archaeological park of Sabucina.

Outhouse (November 16, 1828 – October 20, 1889) was the first public school teacher in Portland, Oregon. He taught in Portland from 1851 to 1853.  Early life  Outhouse was born on November 16, 1828, in Nova Scotia, and moved to Portland in 1850, when he was 22.  Teaching in Portland  The following year, Outhouse became the first public school teacher in Portland. In December 1851, the school board, which at the time consisted of Anthony L. Davis, Alonzo Leland, and Reuben P. Boise, appointed him to teach Portland's first public school, in a \\"little frame house\\" at the corner of SW First and Oak streets. The building was used for church gatherings as well as for classes. The following advertisement was published in The Oregonian on December 6, 1851: > In pursuance of a vote of the Portland school district at their annual > meeting, the directors have established a free school. The first term will > commence on Monday, the 15th inst., at the schoolhouse in this city, near > the City Hotel. (John W. Outhouse, teacher.) The directors would recommend > the following books to be used in the school, viz.: Sandler's Series of > Readers and Spellers, Goodrich's Geography, Thompson's Arithmetics and > Bullion's Grammar. The school opened on December 15, with about 20 pupils, who came from as far away as Astoria. Outhouse's pupils included John Miller Murphy, who would later found The Washington Standard in 1860. His income for teaching was $100 per month, and he supplemented that by laying sidewalks and unloading ships. By 1852, the school was moved to a building on the corner of First and Taylor streets. Another teacher, Miss Abigail M. Clark was hired. Outhouse retired from teaching in Portland in 1853. Soon after that, Sylvester Pennoyer, who had come from New York to Puget Sound and started an unsuccessful law firm, became the next schoolteacher of Portland Public Schools.  Later life  On October 31, 1863, Outhouse attended a pro-Union rally in Dallas, Oregon. There, according to the Oregon Sentinel, Outhouse declared himself a \\"Union man,\\" and that he was \\"equally opposed to Secession and Abolitionism.\\" In 1865, Outhouse married C. W. Cottel. After teaching in Portland, Outhouse moved to Polk County, Oregon, and married. He later moved to La Grande, Oregon. In 1875 he was appointed Vice President of the newly formed Teacher's Institute in La Grande, where he presented on \\"his method of teaching English grammar in his usual happy way of illustration.\\" He was appointed superintendent in 1880. He was described as an \\"unflinching democrat tree to his party\\" by the Eastern Oregon Republican newspaper. In 1885, he was appointed to the La Grande land office by President Grover Cleveland, and he held that position until his death. In his later life, Outhouse had severe gout, and walked on crutches for several years. Although he had children, they all died young. He died in La Grande, on Wednesday, October 20 (or 28, or 29) 1889, survived by his wife.  Legacy  In February 1959, to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Oregon's statehood, an eighth grade class at Capital Hill School reenacted Outhouse's instruction at the Portland Schoolhouse.

Completed in 1928, it has the capacity to hold . View across Grwyne Fawr dam View down the Grwyne Fawr valley from the dam Construction By the end of the 19th-century there were serious water shortages in the western parts of the historic county of Monmouthshire. The area had seen a massive population increase as a result of the steel and coal industries but the supply of water to the area was complicated due to its high altitude. A site for a new reservoir was chosen at the head of the Grwyne Fawr valley because at 1725 ft above sea level it was high enough to allow water to be gravity fed to Abertillery and the surrounding areas. Building works started in 1912, but almost immediately hit problems. The road constructed up the valley could not take the weight of the heavy traction engines used for haulage. It was decided that a new railway would be required, however negotiations with local land owners failed and the line remained incomplete. With the outbreak of the first world war proceedings were put on hold. Work recommenced in January 1919, the railway was completed and connected to the main line at Llanvihangel Crucorney. A village of construction workers and their families grew in the valley at Blaen-y-cwm. A community of some 300 people lived there with a hostel, canteen, day school, police station and hospital. The workmen quarried 200,000 tons of sandstone for the construction of the dam. Large boulders weighing up to 5 tons each were set in concrete to form the dam, which is 130 feet thick at its base, the walls were then faced with dressed stone. A 16-inch diameter steel pipeline was tunnelled through Coity Mountain carrying water to a holding reservoir in Cwmtillery. The dam was finally completed in February 1928, after which the railway and structures that served its construction were quickly dismantled including the workers village. The total cost of construction was reported to be £1 million. Operation The reservoir has been decommissioned by Dŵr Cymru, the local water company, and no longer supplies drinking water. Poor management of the surrounding catchment area has allowed peat sediment to wash into the reservoir causing water discolouration and it has proved uneconomical to remedy the problem.

McClary was born in Ulster, Ireland and came to colonial America with his parents at age sixteen where they lived on a farm in New Hampshire. Here the McClary family also built a tavern, where town meetings were also held. Many of New Hampshire's prominent and influential men had come from the McClary family. In session Andrew McClary had also become the Town Clerk and soon a notable community leader during the years before the revolution. In the mid 1700s New Hampshire frontier McClary gained much of his field experience leading expeditions against hostile Indians in the area. Just before the revolution McClary planned and led an attack on a British supply depot at the castle at Portsmouth. McClary was said to have been a natural leader and one who greatly inspired morale among the New Hampshire militia. During the revolution he assembled a company of men in New Hampshire and marched over seventy miles to Boston and fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill. During the retreat he was the last soldier to leave the battle site. Soon after he was killed when he returned to the site to survey British activity, the last American soldier to die during the battle. Early life and career Andrew McClary was the second son of his father, Andrew Senior, who emigrated from Ulster, Ireland, with his wife and children to the British colonies in 1726 to escape British oppression that was common in Ireland in those days. In 1733 his family moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire, where they lived until 1738 and then moved to Epsom, New Hampshire, where the elder McClary soon died. McClary stood well over six feet tall, with a straight, proportioned and athletic build, with blue eyes and was known as a jovial and generous man. The McClary family were among the most prominent and respected families in the Suncook Valley region. McClary and his older brother John McClary were the leading influential men in all the town and military affairs.Browne, 1910, pp. 35, 38 John became a colonel just before the American Revolution began.Vrowne, french, 1910, p. 524 His nephew Michael would later become General Michael McClary.Stearns, 1908, p. 707 McClary served as the town clerk. His entries in the town books revealed a thorough knowledge of business and language and according to contemporary historian John C. French, exhibited a unique literary and writing style. His last entry in the town's records were made approximately one year before he died.BrowneFrench, 1910, p. 40 McClary married Elizabeth McCrillis, their marriage producing five sons (James, Harvey, Andrew, John, and William) and three daughters (Elizabeth, Margaret, and Nancy.)The McClary Family of EpsomStearns, 1908, p. 524 Born in Ireland in 1730, (when it was the Kingdom of Ireland), McClary received his basic education there before coming to the colonies in America with his parents. McClary helped his father build a tavern on their farm in Epsom, which the younger McClary managed on a regular basis. After the death of his father in 1765 he became the proprietor of the farm and its tavern. With no meetinghouse in Epsom before 1794, all the town meetings were held at McClary’s Farm Tavern, which was also used for various social gatherings. In 1755 McClary led a company of soldiers in search of the Indians who massacred and took prisoners from the McCall family of Salisbury. During the French and Indian War the colonials of the New England frontier lived in constant fear of Indian attacks. McClary spent much of his time scouting the area, along with hunting and clearing of the land. He also became a local champion in the sport of boxing and wrestling. Along with Robert Rogers, McClary was also close friends with noted Revolutionary War figures like, John Goffe and John Stark, often meeting with them at the McClary farm tavern with increasing frequency where matters of the Revolution were now being openly discussed. Military life As an experienced scout in New Hampshire McClary was soon promoted an officer at an early age in Robert Roger's famous company of New Hampshire Rangers, and finally, as he gained experience, was chosen to be the leader in all local engagements against the local Indians.Carleton, 2003, pp. 17-18Major Andrew McClary, ancestry.com In the months preceding the Revolutionary War it is said that McClary began to distinguish himself for his resolution and patriotism in planning and leading the attack of the castle at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on December 1, 1774.Heath, 1901, p. 369 For what was considered his heroic efforts, McClary had won for himself a prominent standing among the New Hampshire Militia.Ketchum, 1974, p. 146 =Battle of Bunker Hill= The Death of General Warren by John Trumbull \\\\---- McClary (center left) is depicted in Trumbull's famous painting, wearing a white shirt with musket in hand and standing behind the mortally wounded Dr. Warren.Library of Congress, The Battle of Bunker's Hill On April 27, 1775, when word of the Battles at Lexington and Concord reached the Suncook Valley in New Hampshire, McClary was busy plowing land back on his farm. He and other patriots gathered and \\"flew to arms\\" and assembled at Nottingham Square. There they made Captain McClary commander of the company consisting of eighty men. They departed from Nottingham Square at one o'clock in the afternoon and conducted a \\"rapid march\\" south to Kingston. From there they continued at a fast pace without resting until sunset, arriving at Haverhill, just over the Massachusetts border on the Merrimack River. McClary's company covered twenty-seven miles in six hours. They continued for a few more miles then stopped and took supper at Andover. After resting a bit they resumed marching through the night and by sunrise had covered seventy miles distance. After passing through Medford, they continued south and marched on Cambridge Common where upon arrival were all willing and eager to fight for the Revolution. There McClary and his company joined up with Colonel John Stark, who gave McClary the rank of major.Frothingham, 1890, p. 96 On June 16 they received orders to join with American forces and prepare for battle at Bunker Hill, in Charlestown across the Mystic River from Boston. The battle was to take place on the Charleston Peninsula which was only accessible to American infantry by crossing over the very narrow Charleston Neck.See: Battle of Bunker Hill map During the first British advance on the American fortifications atop Breed's Hill, McClary, along with Seth Pomeroy, John Stark, James Reed and Thomas Knowlton, were at the front in the redoubt.Frothingham & Swett, 1850, p. 53 According to Colonel Swett in his 1826 account of the battle, when the Americans were finally given the order to fire, McClary, with his stentorian voice, was distinctly heard over the roar of cannon and musket fire, \\"animating and encouraging the men as though he would inspire every ball that sped, with his own fire and energy.\\" Humphreys, Swett, 1826, p. 35 Frothingham, 1890, p. 97 Ellis, 2008, p. 73 As the battle unfolded the American soldiers were directed to spot and fire upon every British officer they could distinguish. When Major McClary would sight an officer he would instantly call out: \\"There, See that officer. Let’s shoot at him!\\" Two or three soldiers, all excellent marksmen, would then fire at the same time, making sure their target was hit. During the battle, though a British tactical victory, they lost a considerable number of officers.Epsom History.com After the battle, with many wounded in the retreat, McClary immediately procured a horse and rode five miles north to Medford and returned with bandages and other supplies for the wounded.Swett, 1826, p. 48 He then prepared to go back across Charlestown Neck to observe any further British movement at Bunker Hill. He was cautioned by his son and other men not to embark on such a risky effort, but McClary exclaimed, \\"The ball is not yet cast that will kill me!\\". Upon returning while crossing the Neck to rejoin his men, a shot from a frigate passed through his body. He leaped a few feet from the ground, keeled over and fell dead on his face. Later McClary would be carried to Medford, and interred with military honors. Henry Dearborn in his 1818 account of the battle wrote of McClary: > \\"There was no cavalry in either army. From the ships of war and a large > battery on Copp's Hill, a heavy cannonade was kept up upon our line and > redoubt...during the retreat; but with very little effect, except that of > killing the brave Major Andrew M'Clary of Col. Stark's regiment soon after > we retired from Bunker Hill. He was among the first officers of the army. > —Possessing a sound judgment, of undaunted bravery, enterprising, ardent and > zealous, both as a patriot and soldier. His loss was severely felt by his > compatriots in arms...\\"Dearborn, 1818, p. 5 McClary was technically the highest-ranking American officer to die in the battle; General Warren had declined an offer of command and had no commission at the time of battle. McClary's death was the last to occur there.Chidsey, 1966, p. 100Ancestry.com: The Battle of Bunker HillAncestry.com Major: Andrew McClary He was one among the ten American officers to perish during the battle.Ellis, 1895 (reprint 2008), p. 145 McClary's body was taken to Medford, Massachusetts just outside Boston near the encampment of the New Hampshire Brigade, along with other soldiers who died during the battle, and was buried with military honors. Legacy McClary standing behind Thomas Knowlton, holding musket wearing) white shirt, along with the mortally wounded Warren are among the central figures depicted on a U.S. commemorative postage stamp, issued on the bicentennial anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1975 A eulogy to McClary appeared in The New Hampshire Gazette, dated Epsom, July 1775. It read: \\"The Major discovered great intrepidity and presence of mind in the action, and his noble soul glowed with ardor and the love of his country. . . .\\" On June 17, 1843, the 68th anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, Andrew McClary's name was spoken in the closing words in the dedication to the Monument at Bunker Hill.Carleton, 2003, p. 18 In honor of McClary, a bronze memorial tablet was unveiled at Epsom on August 25, 1905, with appropriate honors. The tablet was secured through the efforts of the Epsom Historical Club, and is attached to a tall granite pillar, weighing approximately .Browne, French, 1910, p.35 McClary's image appears in John Trumbull's famous painting of the Battle of Bunker Hill, where he is pictured raising his musket to shoot the British soldier attempting to bayonet the mortally wounded Warren.

She survived the Haun's Mill massacre of 1838 in Missouri. She also helped organize the first Relief Society in Salt Lake City. Early life Amanda Barnes was born on February 22, 1809, in Becket, Massachusetts, to Ezekiel and Fanny Johnson Barnes. She was the fifth of their nine children. Her father did not belong to any religious denomination. Her mother was Presbyterian. After her birth, the family moved to Ohio, where she grew up. Conversion Amanda Barnes married Warren Smith when she was 18. He was a blacksmith. She joined the Campbellites when Sidney Rigdon and Orson Hyde shared their beliefs with her. While her husband did not join with her, he consented. She was baptized by Rigdon. After she had a set of twins, Alma and Alvira, missionaries from the Church of Christ taught her of their beliefs. She was taught by Simeon Carter. She was baptized on April 1, 1831, and her husband was baptized shortly thereafter. In 1832, the family moved to Kirtland, Ohio, selling their house in Amherst, Ohio. Her parents did not approve of their decision to convert and wished to never see them again. As members of the church, she and her husband helped establish the Kirtland Bank and build the Kirtland Temple. Haun's Mill massacre In 1838, the family moved to Missouri and ended up traveling with ten other families that were led by Joseph Young. On the way, the family was stopped by a mob. They were taken back five miles and held by guards. They were kept for three days, and then let go. They arrived at Haun's Mill, Missouri, on October 28, 1838, on their journey to Far West, Missouri. After being in Haun's Mill for only two days, a mob of anti-Mormons attacked the settlement. The mob comprised over 200 men. At least 17 members of the church were killed. Smith was shot at, but not harmed in the shooting. She escaped with her two daughters. The family's house had been robbed and their money was stolen, leaving them with nothing. Smith recorded in her journal that she had lost $50 in goods, $50 in a pocketbook and accounts, $100 in damages, and a gun worth $10. Smith's son Sardius and her husband were killed in the massacre. Her son Alma was shot and there was nothing remaining of his left hip. Her son Willard recorded the event of the massacre and said that his mother received divine inspiration to heal Alma's shattered hip. She used ashes and made a lye solution to coat the wound. She then used elm roots to make a poultice. Alma's hip recovered after laying in the same position for five weeks. While Alma was recovering, the family had to stay in Missouri, since the boy could not be moved. There was fear that the mob would strike again. Smith recalls crawling to a corn field and offering a prayer. After praying, she recorded that she heard a voice that repeated the words from \\"How Firm a Foundation\\", a Mormon hymn: Throughout this event, Smith states that she had the faith that she and her family would be all right and that God would heal her son. When Alma was healed, the remaining family members moved to Quincy, Illinois, on February 1, 1839. The news of the apparently miraculous recovery of her son led several physicians to approach her, asking how she had performed the surgery that healed her son. She replied that Jesus Christ had healed him. In Quincy, she became a schoolteacher to support her family. Later years and death Smith married another Warren Smith, who was not related to her first husband. With him she had three children. The couple later divorced. She saw the completion of the Nauvoo Temple in July 1847, where she received her endowment. Smith was a member of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo. She traveled with Emma Smith and Eliza R. Snow to visit the governor of Illinois, Thomas Carlin. In 1850, Smith traveled westward to the Salt Lake Valley. She helped organize the first Relief Society in Salt Lake City. Smith was called as the Assistant Secretary of the organization on January 24, 1854, and served in that position until Brigham Young reorganized the Relief Society. She later served as the President of Relief Society in the 12th Ward. She also helped in the organization of Sunday School She died on June 30, 1886, and was buried in Richmond, Utah. At the time of her death, she was visiting her daughter Alvira Hendricks.

It arose from the first partition of Mecklenburg after the death of Henry Borwin II, Lord of Mecklenburg in 1226. Initially it was named after its capital Parchim. Later, following the transferral of the seat to Richenberg, the name shifted to Richenberg. The Lordship comprised the lands of Parchim (included Brenz and Rosengarten), the rural area of Ture and the later Vogteis of Plau, Goldberg, Sternberg and finally Richenberg (on the Warnow near Langen Brütz). It was the shortest-lived of the four partitioned principalities of Mecklenburg. Pribislaw I The first prince of Parchim-Richenberg was Pribislaw I from the House of Mecklenburg (Obotrites), the youngest son of Henry Borwin II. He grew up at the court of his brother John I, Lord of Mecklenburg. Since Pribislaw was still too young, John managed the lordship for his brother until 1238. Soon after he assumed his full position, border conflicts with the Counts of Schwerin erupted, and he had to cede Brenz and Neustadt-Glewe. After this feud he managed to stabilise the territory economically by founding the towns of Goldberg and Sternberg, and through the settlement of Jews in Parchim. He bestowed the ' (Parchim town privileges) on Lübz, Goldberg and Sternberg. In 1249 Parchim New Town was founded on the western shore of the Elde. In 1248 Pribislaw relocated his residence from Parchim to the newly built castle of Richenberg on the Warnow near the village of Kritzow. Thereafter the lordship was also known as Parchim-Richenberg. The reasons for the move are unknown. After disputes with Rudolf, Bishop of Schwerin Pribislaw was captured and taken to him. Pribislaw was removed from power in 1255 and the Principality was divided between his brothers and his brother-in-law, the Count of Schwerin. Pribislaw went into exile in Pomerania and received the Lordship of Belgard in Farther Pomerania as compensation.  References  * Parchim-Richenberg Parchim-Richenberg !

Animal welfare and rights in South Korea is about the laws concerning and treatment of non-human animals in South Korea. South Korea's animal welfare laws are weak by international standards, and ethical vegetarianism and veganism appear to be rare. There are a handful of animal welfare and rights organizations working in South Korea, which appear to be focused largely on the welfare of companion animals and the dog meat trade.  Legislation  South Korea's major animal welfare legislation is the Animal Protection Act, passed in 1991. The stated aims of the act are to \\"promote the lives, safety, and welfare of animals and to promote the emotional development of people so as to respect the lives of animals by providing for matters necessary to prevent cruelty to animals and to protect and manage animals appropriately\\". The law prohibits cruelty against vertebrates such as cattle, horses, pigs, dogs, cats, rabbits, chickens, ducks, goats, sheep, deer, foxes, and mink, but excluding fish, crustaceans, and other animals commonly used by humans. Cruelty includes killing an animal by a cruel method or in public or in the presence of an animal of the same species; injuring an animal with a \\"tool or drug\\"; collecting fluid from the body of a live animal; injuring an animal for entertainment; or otherwise injury without grounds approved by the Ordinance of the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. The law exempts acts done for the prevention or treatment of disease, experimentation or \\"folk games\\". The penalty for cruelty is imprisonment with labor up to 1 year or a ten million won (approximately 8,450 USD) fine. The penalty for abandonment is up to one million won. The law gives the state no powers to ban people from owning animals if they have been convicted of cruelty, nor does it impose higher penalties for repeat animal cruelty offenders. The law also creates a duty of care. Under the original law, owners and keepers of animals must provide appropriate feed and water and endeavor to ensure that animals in their care exercise and rest adequately. A 2011 amendment changes the \\"endeavor\\" wording to a strict liability requirement and creates a penalty of imprisonment for some offences. Concerning farm animals, in particular, the law requires animals to be registered, stipulates certain protections for animals in transport, and requires that slaughter is done using a method specified by the Ordinance of the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, such as stunning or gas. The government is to formulate and implement a comprehensive animal welfare plan every five years, including matters related to animal farming. Regarding animal testing, alternatives to animals must be considered, animals less sensitive to pain should be used where possible, anesthetics are required, and lost or abandoned animals which have served humans (e.g. guide dogs) must not be used. The law stipulates that Animal Experimentation Ethics Committees be created in facilities where animals are experimented on. In addition to the Animal Protection Act, the Wildlife Protection and Management Act prohibits killing wild animals by cruel methods like poisoning; hurting captured animals, and collecting fluid or body parts from a living wild animal. In 2014 and again in 2020, South Korea received a D out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.  Animal issues  = Animal farming and consumption = Animal product consumption in South Korea is growing. A report by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs found that per capita meat consumption increased from 11.3 kg in 1980 to 42.7 kg in 2013. Vegetarianism and veganism appear to be rare, though these may be growing. South Korea's beef cattle originated as draft animals on rice farms. Many are still raised on rice farms as a secondary activity in small operations of 1-4 cattle at a time. Pigs and chickens are farmed intensively, and their production has grown substantially over the past three decades. Growth in poultry production began to grow significantly in the 1980s and 1990s with the introduction of fast-food fried chicken franchises. Pork production grew by 200% in the 1980s and over 50% in the 1990s. There is a trend towards the concentration of chicken and pig farming in a smaller number of low-cost producers. Dog meat sold in Gyeongdong Market, Seoul, South Korea. The dog meat trade is a major concern for South Korean animal activists. Over 2 million dogs are consumed each year, with pet dogs being stolen and sold into the trade and killed in brutal ways (e.g. beating, electrocution) in violation of the Animal Protection Act. Several thousand cats are also killed for food or medicinal uses each year, sometimes killed in inhumane ways such as boiling alive in pressure cookers. = Animal testing = In a 2013 poll, 7/10 South Korean respondents supported an end to testing cosmetics on animals. That year, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced a policy proposal to recognize non-animal test results for functional cosmetics like sunscreens and anti-wrinkle creams. In 2015, a law was passed which mandates the use of non-animal alternative tests for certain cosmetics determined by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, effective 2018. The number of animals used in research in 2016, according to the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency of South Korea, was 2,878,907. By species this was 91.4% rodents (mice, rats etc), 4.1% fish, 1.9% birds, 1.3% rabbits, and 1.3% other vertebrate species.Animal Research in South Korea in 2016, Speaking of Research, 19 April 2017, Accessed: 22 June 2017 The number of animals used in research has risen steadily since 2008 when only 760,296 animals were used. A new opinion poll conducted in July 2020 by independent polling company Realmeter, and commissioned by Humane Society International/Korea, reveals that the majority of the Korean public want to see their tax money spent on supporting these advanced approaches instead of animal testing. Almost 82% of respondents want to see the 21st National Assembly session demonstrate legislative support for alternatives to animal testing, which includes approaches such as human organ-mimics and tests using human-derived cells instead of experiments on mice, monkeys and dogs. https://www.hsi.org/news- media/new-poll-shows-koreans-support-increased-funding-for-non-animal- research-methods/ = Animals used for clothing = There are no fur farms in South Korea, but South Korea is one of the five largest fur importers in the world, purchasing ₩247 billion-worth of furs in 2012. The popularity of fur has risen in recent years, with total market value rising from ₩789 billion in 2007 to ₩1.1 trillion in 2012. Demand for leather is also on the rise, with an increase of 48% between 2007 and 2012. The market value of leather reached ₩1.6 trillion in 2012, 66% of which is produced domestically.  Animal activism  There are a small number of animal welfare organizations in South Korea, with interest in animal welfare on the rise. The largest animal activist organization in the country is Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth (CARE), founded 2002. CARE operates no-kill animal shelters, educates the public on a range of animal rights and welfare issues including dog meat, animal testing, factory farming, whaling, and fur, and conducts factory farm investigations. International Aid for Korean Animals (IAKA) was founded in 1997 to educate the public, especially schoolchildren, about the cruelty of trade in dog meat and animal medicine. Their sister organization the Korea Animal Protection and Education Society (KAPES) educates the public about adoption, spaying, and neutering, and proper pet care. In 2016 the animal rights group Animal Arirang launched a petition to include clauses on animal rights in the South Korean constitution. The British-based animal rights organization [{ World Protection for Dogs and Cats in the Meat Trade \\"https://www.notodogmeat.com\\" }] has partnered with Korean Activist Group CGAON whose actions in 2016 resulted in Moran Market no longer slaughtering dogs in public The California-based animal rights organization In Defense of Animals partners with South Korean allies to stage animal rights protests, rescue dogs from dog farms, and lobby the government to better enforce existing animal protection laws. Two of the most active and respected Korean groups are Korea Animal Rights Advocates url=https://www.ekara.org/ and Korea Animal Welfare Association url=https://www.animals.or.kr/home/english both of which are partner groups of Humane Society International, one of the largest animal protection groups in the world url=https://www.hsi.org/ HSI has a Korean office, HSI/Korea which is very actively involved in the campaign to end the dog meat trade, and on replacing the use of animals in scientific experiments with advanced human-relevant methods.

Gienapp (February 27, 1944 – October 29, 2003) was an American historian, noted for his writing on the period of the American Civil War. His prize-winning The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852-1856 (1987) was based on original research and revised the traditional understanding of the political party's origins. Later he wrote Abraham Lincoln and Civil War America: A Biography (2002). He co-authored a widely-used United States history textbook, Nation of Nations, and compiled one of the most widely-used documentary readers on the era of the Civil War, The Civil War and Reconstruction: A Documentary Collection (2001). Many years after his death, his wife, Erica Gienapp, completed one of his final projects: The Civil War Diary of Gideon Welles, Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy: The Original Manuscript Edition (2014). It restored one of the most important primary sources of Abraham Lincoln's administration to its complete, original form. During his tenure at Harvard University, Gienapp acquired a reputation as a teacher and mentor of graduate students. In addition to teaching popular courses on the American Civil War, Reconstruction, and antebellum America, he also taught a popular course on the history of baseball in the United States. Gienapp held a B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied under Kenneth Stampp, and an M.A. from Yale University. After earning his doctorate in 1980, Gienapp began working at the University of Wyoming. He became a visiting associate professor at Harvard in 1988 before formally joining the faculty the following year. Gienapp died prematurely in the fall of 2003 at the age of 59 from complications surrounding a rare form of blood cancer. He was survived by his wife and two sons. The Republican Party emerged from the great political realignment of the mid-1850s. Gienapp argues that the great realignment of the 1850s began before the Whig party collapse, and was caused not by politicians but by voters at the local level. The central forces were ethno-cultural, involving tensions between pietistic Protestants versus liturgical Catholics, Lutherans and Episcopalians regarding Catholicism, prohibition, and nativism. Anti-slavery did play a role but it was less important at first. The Know-Nothing party embodied the social forces at work, but its weak leadership was unable to solidify its organization, and the Republicans picked it apart. Nativism was so powerful that the Republicans could not avoid it, but they did minimize it and turn voter wrath against the threat that slave owners would buy up the good farm lands wherever slavery was allowed. The realignment was a powerful because it forced voters to switch parties, as typified by the rise and fall of the Know-Nothings, the rise of the Republican Party, and the splits in the Democratic Party.

This cloud-based platform is developed and served by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). PrecisionFDA connects experts, citizen scientists, and scholars from around the world and provides them with a library of computational tools, workflow features, and reference data. The platform allows researchers to upload and compare data against reference genomes, and execute bioinformatic pipelines. The variant call file (VCF) comparator tool also enables users to compare their genetic test results to reference genomes. The platform's code is open source and available on GitHub. The platform also features a crowdsourcing model to sponsor community challenges in order to stimulate the development of innovative analytics that inform precision medicine and regulatory science. Community members from around the world come together to participate in scientific challenges, solving problems that demonstrate the effectiveness of their tools, testing the capabilities of the platform, sharing their results, and engaging the community in discussions. Globally, precisionFDA has more than 5,000 users. The precisionFDA team collaborates with multiple FDA Centers, the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies to support the vision and intent of the American Innovation & Competitiveness Act and the 21st Century Cures Act. History President Barack Obama announced the formation of the Precision Medicine Initiative during the State of the Union Address in January 2015. In August 2015, the FDA announced the launch of precisionFDA as a part of the initiative. In November 2015, the FDA launched a \\"closed beta\\" version of the platform, giving select groups and individuals access to the platform. An open beta version of the platform was released in December 2015. In February 2016, the FDA announced the first precisionFDA challenge, the Consistency Challenge, which tasked users with testing the reliability and reproducibility of gene mapping and variant calling tools. The Truth Challenge followed the Consistency Challenge and asked participants to assess the accuracy of bioinformatics tools for identifying genetic variants. The Hidden Treasures – Warm Up challenge evaluated variant calling pipelines on a targeted set of in silico injected variants. The CFSAN Pathogen Detection Challenge evaluated bioinformatics pipelines for accurate and rapid detection of foodborne pathogens in metagenomics samples. The CDRH ID-NGS Diagnostics Biothreat Challenge addressed the issue of early detection during pathogen outbreaks by evaluating algorithms for identifying and quantifying emerging pathogens, such as the Ebola virus, from their genomic fingerprints. Subsequent challenges expanded beyond genomics into multi-omics and other data types. The NCI-CPTAC Multi-omics Enabled Sample Mislabeling Correction Challenge addressed the issue of sample mislabeling, which contributes to irreproducible research results and invalid conclusions, by evaluating algorithms for accurate detection and correction of mislabeled samples using multi-omics to enable Rigor and Reproducibility in biomedical research. The Brain Cancer Predictive Modeling and Biomarker Discovery Challenge, run in collaboration with Georgetown University, asked participants to develop machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models to identify biomarkers and predict brain cancer patient outcomes using gene expression, DNA copy number, and clinical data. The Gaining New Insights by Detecting Adverse Event Anomalies Using FDA Open Data Challenge engaged data scientists to use unsupervised ML and AI techniques to identify anomalies in FDA adverse events, regulated product substances, and clinical trials data, essential for improving the mission of FDA. The Truth Challenge V2 assessed variant calling pipeline performance in difficult-to-map regions, segmental duplications, and Major Histocompatibility Complex (HMC) using Genome in a Bottle human genome benchmarks. The COVID-19 Risk Factor Modeling Challenge, in collaboration with the Veterans Health Administration, called upon the scientific and analytics community to develop and evaluate computational models to predict COVID-19 related health outcomes in Veterans. In total, ten community challenges have been completed on precisionFDA, which have generated a total of 562 responses from 240 participants. PrecisionFDA challenges have led to meaningful regulatory science advancements, including published best practices for benchmarking germline small-variant calls in human genomes. In addition, the challenges have incentivized the development and benchmarking of novel computational pipelines, including a pipeline that uses deep neural networks to identify genetic variants. In addition to challenges, in-person and virtual app-a-thon events, which promote the development and sharing of apps and tools, are hosted on precisionFDA. In August 2016, precisionFDA launched App- a-Thon in a Box, which aimed to encourage the creation and sharing of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) apps and executable Linux command wrappers. The most recent app-a-thon, the BioCompute Object App-a-thon, sought to improve the reproducibility of bioinformatics pipelines. Participants were asked to create BioCompute Objects (BCOs), a standardized schema for reporting computational scientific workflows, and apps to develop BCOs and check their conformance to BioCompute Specifications. In April 2016, precisionFDA was awarded the top prize in the Informatics category at the Bio IT World Best Practices Awards. In 2018, the DNAnexus platform, which is leveraged by precisionFDA, was granted Authority to Operate (ATO) by Health and Human Services (HHS) for FedRAMP Moderate. In addition, the precisionFDA team received an FDA Commissioner’s Special Citation Award in 2019 for outstanding achievements and collaboration in the development of the precisionFDA platform promoting innovative regulatory science research to modernize the regulation of NGS-based genomic tests. In 2019, precisionFDA received a FedHealthIT Innovation Award and transitioned from a beta to a production release state.
