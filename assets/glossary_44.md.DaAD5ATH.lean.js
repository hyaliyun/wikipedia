(1995). \\"Kitabatake Chikafusa\\", Great Thinkers of the Eastern World, p. 335. was a Japanese court noble and writer of the 14th century who supported the Southern Court in the Nanboku-cho period,Iwao, Seiichi et al. (2002). Dictionnaire historique du Japon, p. 1553. serving as advisor to five Emperors. Some of his greatest and most famous work was performed during the reign of Emperor Go-Daigo, under whom he proposed a series of reforms, amounting to a revival or restoration of political and economic systems of several centuries earlier. In addition to authoring a history of Japan and a number of works defending the right of Go-Daigo's line to the throne, Kitabatake fought in defense of the Southern Court as a member of the Murakami branch of the Minamoto clan.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon. (1962). Sovereign and Subject, pp. 139‚Äì241. Politics Kitabatake, in his writings, held a strong distaste for the Ashikaga clan, the ruling family at the time who held the position of Sh≈çgun and maintained a rival Imperial court known as the Northern Court. This disdain came not only because they were warriors rather than nobles, who were clumsy and uncouth at Court, but because they were of a less distinguished branch of the famous Minamoto clan than Kitabatake's own Murakami branch. In particular, he disliked Ashikaga Takauji, the first Ashikaga shogun, who had originally supported Go-Daigo's claim to the Throne, but who ultimately headed the Northern Court and sought to destroy all who supported the Emperor's Southern Court. Kitabatake also wrote of Nitta Yoshisada, one of the greatest military supporters of Go-Daigo, in a bad light. He saw Nitta as a warrior, little different from the Shoguns, but also accused him of never being available when the Emperor called upon him. Had Nitta been more available in the south of the country, instead of fighting his own battles in the north, Kitabatake claims, Nitta could have prevented the death of his son Akiie. When Go-Daigo died in 1339, Kitabatake was under siege in his stronghold in Hitachi Province. He sent copies of his major works to the new emperor, twelve-year-old Emperor Go-Murakami, advising him and his advisors. Though he is most well known for his writings and his role as Imperial advisor, Kitabatake was also a competent commander in battle, and held off the superior forces of the shogunate on many occasions. The siege of Hitachi lasted four years, and though his fortress ultimately fell to the supporters of the shogunate, Kitabatake escaped to Yoshino, the capital of the Southern Court, where he advised the Emperor until his own death in 1354. Works In his writings on the legitimate imperial lineage, Kitabatake delved into the subject of land ownership. In one document he denounces the Provincial Shugo and Jit≈ç (Constables and Stewards) as land-hungry, and writes that the creation of this system in 1190 altered the traditional state of the country, and caused it to lose the art of government. Though the full details of his ideas for reform are unknown, it is likely that Kitabatake sought a return to the governmental structures set down during the Taih≈ç Era, in 702, before the rise of feudalism and military rule. He recognized that certain privileges gained by the bushi (great warrior families) and kuge (Court nobility) in that time would not be relinquished, but he did seek to abolish the systems of land tenure and tax collection that supported the power of the bushi. Kitabatake viewed the bushi, and by extension the bakufu (shogunate), the military government, as enemies of the throne. In 1339, he wrote Jinn≈ç Sh≈çt≈çki, which related the history of Japan through analysis of the Imperial reigns, from the earliest legendary semi-mythical emperors down to Daig≈ç II and his successor Murakami II. It was intended largely as a guide to the young Murakami, and as a treatise defending the Southern Court's legitimacy. It was largely written on the road, and recompiled and edited in 1343. One of the issues it addressed was the chaotic and unbalanced distribution of land, which he blamed on the government. But he also blamed the government officials and feudal lords who claimed the land. He wrote that seeking rewards was not part of proper behavior, and that it was a warrior's place to give up land and even his life for duty. He also claimed that the chaos of feudalism was derived, ultimately, from an unlimited number of people claiming a limited amount of land. Kitabatake's other major work, Shokugen-sh≈ç, was also written in 1339, largely from memory, as the author, under siege in his home province, was unable to perform research at Court. It described the origins and organization of governmental offices and structures, as well as the author's opinions on the promotion and appointment of officials. Legacy Kitabatake is considered one of the greatest men of his time, along with his rival Ashikaga Takauji. Though his works are heavily colored by his personal bias and political motives, they are some of the most detailed accounts available on the history of Japan's feudal government and Imperial line.

Life He was born in Laterza to Francesco Tria and Margherita Geminale. He completed his studies in Philosophy, Theology, and Civil and Ecclesiastical Law at Naples and Rome. In 1704 he was an \\"auditor\\" of ecclesiastical law at the Benedictine Monastery of Cava and he remained in the service of this Abbey even when he was transferred to Rome. On 26 August 1709 he was nominated Vicar General to Monsignor Lorenzo Gherardi, the Bishop of Loreto e Recanati, and he continued in this position until 1714. Later he served with Monsignor Giuseppe Firrao, the \\"Nunzio Straordinario\\" to the Court of Portugal. When Monsignor Firrao, for reasons of health, was reassigned to Switzerland, Tria traveled with him to Lucerne. During Tria's stay in Switzerland he undertook important missions in Sweden and Germany. Tria was elected the Bishop of Cariati and Gerenza and he assumed his position on 17 March 1720 in time to preside over a Synod (16 ‚Äì 18 March 1726). He was transferred to the diocese of Larino, in the Molise, on 23 February 1727. He participated in a provincial council in Benevento from 1 to 12 May in 1729. In 1740 he was nominated a \\"consultant of the Holy Office\\" and in December of the same year he was nominated Archbishop of Tiro. He became the \\"Examiner of Bishops\\" and he was decorated with the insignia of the Cavalier of the Order of Saint Jacob for his meritorious service to the Court of Lisbon. He died of apoplexy in Rome. Works His scholarly works include \\"The Memorable Stories, Civil and Ecclesiastical of the City and Diocese of Larino\\" (published in Rome, 1744), \\"Notes of the accommodation between the Papacy and the Royal Court of Naples\\" (published in Rome, 1743), and \\"Life of Pope Benedetto XIII\\". His major work, however, is the history of the community he came to love. He wrote of Larino's earliest days prior to its conquest by Rome, the onslaught of the barbarians, the Saracens, and the Normans. Tria's scholarly writings have become an invaluable resource to the life of Molise, not only in the dim past, but during the prelate's lifetime. Since the essential physical structure of the Cathedral in Larino (1312) is unaltered, his description on the monumental entrance way of this minor basilica can be followed by the present day observer.

He last played for Akwesasne Warriors of the Federal Hockey League. Playing career =Amateur= As a youth, Dagenais played in the 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Mille-√éles in Laval, Quebec. Dagenais began his junior career after being drafted by the Moncton Alpines of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) when he was 17 years old. He quickly became a young star on his team, leading the team in points and goals in his rookie campaign in the 1995-96 season. Dagenais was drafted 47th overall in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils, but remained in the QMJHL. Six games into the following season, Dagenais was traded to the Laval Titan for Mathieu Letourneau. At mid- season he was traded to the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies for Yanick Hubert and Jean- Philippe Soucy. In the 1997‚Äì98 season, Dagenais led the QMJHL in goals and was second in points. That year Dagenais met Mike Ribeiro, who finished second in points after Pierre. Ribeiro and Dagenais developed a great friendship while playing on the same line throughout the entire season. In the summer of 1998, Dagenais was once again draft eligible as he had not signed a contract with the Devils, he was then re-drafted by New Jersey with the 105th overall pick in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. =Professional= The 1998‚Äì99 season was Dagenais' professional hockey debut. He played with the New Jersey Devils' AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats. The 1999‚Äì00 season was better than his first professional season. He finished among the top scorers in the league with 35 goals. In 2000‚Äì01 season Dagenais was selected to the AHL's second all-star team. He also was called up by the New Jersey Devils and played his first NHL games. In the 2001‚Äì02 season he played 16 games with the Devils. He was placed on waivers by New Jersey and claimed by the Florida Panthers. He spent the majority of the remaining season playing for the Panthers. After next year's training camp, he was sent to the Panther's affiliate AHL team, the San Antonio Rampage. During the summer 2003, the Montreal Canadiens' general manager Bob Gainey surprised some by signing Dagenais to a one-year contract. Dagenais started the 2003‚Äì04 season with the Canadiens' AHL affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs. He played 50 games on the Habs' second line with Mike Ribeiro and Michael Ryder. The line was the most productive of the team and Dagenais scored 27 points. During the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, he played 7 games with HC Ajoie in Switzerland. He was also involved in a controversy during the lockout. In an interview, Dagenais stated he wouldn't mind playing under a salary cap, which was in opposition to the NHLPA's stance. In his return to the NHL in 2005‚Äì06, Dagenais scored the first game winning shootout goal in Montreal for the Canadiens on November 22, 2005. With dwindling offensive numbers he was sent back to the Hamilton Bulldogs in January. He became a restricted free agent during the summer of 2006, and signed a tryout contract with Jokerit in the Finnish SM-liiga in October 2006. His tryout lasted until the SM-liiga Christmas break, and the contract was not renewed. He signed a new contract with Austrian team, HC TWK Innsbruck of the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga and had an excellent 2006‚Äì07 season, scoring 37 goals in only 27 games. He almost led the league in goals, despite playing only half the year. He re- signed with Innsbruck for 2007‚Äì08 season. In 2008, he signed with Kontinental Hockey League club, Traktor Chelyabinsk. After potting 14 goals in 40 games in 2008‚Äì09, Pierre was re-signed to a one-year contract extension on August 5, 2009. In 2010, he signed with the Akwesasne Warriors of the Federal Hockey League. Being one of a few Federal League players with NHL experience, Dagenais was able to score on a regular basis. At the time of his departure, he had played 23 games and scored 26 goals and 54 points and still had a share of the scoring lead a month after his departure from the team. On December 5, Dagenais was listed on the Federal League's site as being recalled to Oslo Elite, a third division team in AustriaPointStreak.com: Akwesasne Warriors Transactions Page The news was reported the following day by ATSE Graz's page. Despite signing a contract, Dagenais said he would not be reporting to ATSE Graz. On 5 January 2011, he signed a contract with Norwegian team V√•lerenga of the GET-ligaen. Dagenais now works in real estate.

At the time of its introduction in 2001, Amp Energy was initially distributed under the Mountain Dew soft drink brand. Beginning in 2009, it was produced and labeled under its own stand-alone trademark name, but in 2018, reverted to using Mountain Dew branding. The beverage is packaged in both 16-ounce and 24-ounce cans, and is sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Lebanon. As of 2009, Amp Energy was the number four energy drink brand in the U.S. in terms of overall retail sales. Flavors The original formulation of Amp Energy was positioned as a flavor extension of the Mountain Dew brand, and in 2001 its label read \\"Amp Energy Drink from Mountain Dew\\". In 2008, the label design was changed to contract the product name to a more concise \\"Amp Energy\\", with the Mountain Dew logo being shifted to the lower portion of the cans. In Amp's 2011 redesign, the Mountain Dew logo was taken off the cans completely. According to beverage industry commentators at the time, this labeling update was enacted with the intent of \\"placing a stronger emphasis on the 'Amp Energy' brand and less on its Mountain Dew roots\\". Amp Energy Original contains taurine, B-vitamins, guarana, ginseng and maltodextrin. 8.4 fluid ounces of Amp contains 74 milligrams of caffeine. The Amp Energy product line has since expanded to a broader range of flavors and variants, which as of 2011 included Amp Energy (Original), Sugar Free, Overdrive (cherry), Relaunch (discontinued) (orange), Elevate (mixed berry), Traction (grape), Green Tea, Lightning (lemonade) and Sugar Free Lightning, and watermelon. Traction has since been renamed to Boost. There was also a limited edition flavor named Tradin Paints which was an Orange/Lime/Berry drink. In February 2010 a new series of juices was launched under the name Amp Energy Juices, which are made with B-vitamins, taurine, ginseng and guarana. These juices are produced in two flavors: Orange and Mixed Berry, and are packaged in 12-ounce bottles. Also introduced at this time was Amp Energy Gum, which is made from a blend of B-vitamins, taurine and caffeine. On March 6, 2013, Amp Energy officially announced that it will re-introduce its Orange flavor. A new line of drinks from the Amp brand was introduced in 2018, titled Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel, bearing the name of Mountain Dew's former line of Game Fuel drinks. The line features a resealable can lid, and has sponsored several esports communities. An 'Amp' branded citrus-flavoured energy drink distributed by Britvic under license from The Coca Cola Company. launched in the UK in August 2013. The United Kingdom version of Amp Energy is released under the 'Mountain Dew' brand with a UK-unique new logo. This is similar to its early release in North America, with the Amp logo featuring the text 'Powered by Mountain Dew' beneath it.

The product was available in 16-ounce cans and featured the same paint scheme as Hendrick Motorsports‚Äô No. 88 Amp Energy/National Guard Chevrolet car. In late 2011, PepsiCo withdrew its Amp Energy sponsorship, replacing it with Diet Mountain Dew. PepsiCo has sponsored the Talladega Superspeedway race for multiple years, resulting in the race being titled the \\"Amp Energy 500\\" in 2008 and 2009, and the \\"AMP Energy Juice 500\\" in 2010. In October 2010, Amp Energy Juice produced a short film about Talladega Superspeedway titled The Legend of Hallowdega which starred David Arquette, directed by Terry Gilliam and included appearances by Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Darrell Waltrip. The sponsorship ended in 2011 as the race is now known as the 1000Bulbs.com 500.

It is down the line from and is situated between and . It is managed by Great Western Railway, which also operates most of the trains that call. South Western Railway operate a limited number of services. The station is located at the junction of Brook Road and Moorland Road; the Brook Road bridge links the two platforms. The station opened in 1929, however, the line through the site has been open since 1840. History Westmoreland goods yard and Bath Oldfield Park was the third station to be constructed in Bath on the G.W.R. line. It is the only station whose platforms are below the surrounding road levels, all the rest of Bath's G.W.R. stations are elevated. The Railway line divides Bath's road systems into two distinct areas. Many new road bridges were necessary to overcome the difficulty posed to local goods traffic by this new railway. The Station is located between two such road bridges, one to the east is called Brougham Hayes bridge. It was originally built on the Tudor arch style of local stone. It was later demolished and replaced with a widened steel and stone structure. This occurred in the early 20th century when an extra line to a goods yard was laid to the end of the westbound platform. Brook Road bridge adjoins the station a short distance to the west. The majority of Brunel's design for Bath was raised up on a system of earth embankments and stone arches. His objective in all his designs were to maintain his \\"billiard table\\" design philosophy. The main obstacle was a skew bridge crossing of the River Avon to link with the main Bath Spa station in the centre of the City. At the approach to the Oldfield Park section a cutting was necessary to maintain the desired level. It was into these cutting embankments that the two platforms were later accommodated. To some extent Oldfield Park replaced an earlier station at Twerton, three-quarters of a mile to the west, which had closed, ostensibly temporarily, in the First World War and which had been badly affected by competing bus and tram services. The Twerton station never reopened. The platforms were designed solely to enable passenger access to the carriages. The limited road and platform access made the handling of bulky goods very difficult. To the east of the westbound platform a single section of line was added from the Westmoreland goods yard in Lower Oldfield Park. This area of ground on the same level as Brunel's railway line was used as a stone yard and marshalling yard for goods wagons. It formed the only G.W.R. terminal in Bath with the necessary access to be able to handle heavy goods. There was originally a full-time station master and ticket office. The 1929 ticket office was constructed of timber on tall wooden piles attached to both the Brook Road bridge and the ground below. It was located at the Moorland Road side of the bridge at road level. This has now been replaced by a portacabin styled ticket office on the westbound platform and a ticket dispensing machine. The ticket office is manned on weekdays during the morning peak times. The station is also part of the Penalty Fares area. Legislation was passed that ensured disabled users had easy access to public areas, the current long access ramp evolved to replace the earlier wooden steps. This new much extended ramp now leads passengers down to the replacement ticket office. Access to the Eastbound platform is via a sloping path leading from the top of Brook Road, and further eastwards a set of steps lead down from Stuart Place. =Community support= A community volunteer tending the station garden Since 2006 there have been a number of local schemes to improve the appearance and the environment surrounding the Station. These have included some landscaping and the planting of shrubs and flowers. In 2010 there were a team of 12 full-time volunteers, and local school children are involved with the project. The number of passengers using the station is now on the increase. This is due in part to the pressure from both the local people and their elected representatives in local government upon First Great Western to improve services. Services A service to Weymouth Passenger services are operated by Great Western Railway. There is generally an hourly service to via Bristol Temple Meads, extending to via on certain journeys. There are also trains to in the morning peak. In the other direction, trains run to a wide range of destinations. These include , , and as well as and stations to ; there is one service a day to and a single direct morning commuter service to and . Commuters for London Paddington must change at . On Sundays the service is less frequent. There is a ticket machine at the station where passengers can collect pre-booked tickets or buy them on the day. There is also a small ticket office where you can buy tickets and ask questions which is open during common commuter periods.

He was a Knight of Malta. Biography =Youth and military career= Carondelet entered the service of the King of Spain in 1762, at age fifteen. By 1781, he commanded the IV Division, which fought at the Siege of Pensacola in 1781. Upon his return to Spain in 1787, he was attached to the Flandres Regimiento, with the rank of Infantry Colonel, and was received in the Order of Malta. During this period he married, against his own family's will, a woman from Arag√≥n whose family was very influential at the royal court, Maria Concepci√≥n Casta√±os y Aragorri. =Governor of El Salvador (1789 - 1791)= Carondelet was named governor of El Salvador in 1789. Because the local indigenous population working in the indigo industry had declined greatly, Carondolet recruited Spanish laborers. Their descendants are among the blonde and fair-skinned people of today's Chalatenango Department. =Governor of Louisiana (1791 - 1797)= After his term as governor of El Salvador ended he was appointed governor of the Spanish colonies of Louisiana and West Florida, from 1791 to 1797. As French was his mother tongue, he was well regarded by the French Creole population. He established Louisiana's first newspaper, Le Moniteur. He made many improvements in the infrastructure of New Orleans, including the Carondelet Canal and the city's first street lighting. The street light tenders (attendants) served as watchmen and de facto municipal police. About 1793, he granted land near Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to the Black Bob Band of Hathawekela Shawnee. U.S. expansion Carondelet became concerned about westward U.S. expansion and was involved in the West Florida Controversy, which concerned the border between West Florida and the United States. He wanted to thwart the American policy of trying to secure unchallenged access to the Mississippi River, a goal which made Spanish colonial officials fear for the independence of Louisiana and New Spain. Working through an alliance with Native American tribes, Carondelet succeeded in thwarting westward American expansion for several years. However, the U.S. finally gained ratification (1795) of Pinckney's Treaty, also known as the Treaty of San Lorenzo. It established intentions of friendship between the U.S. and Spain and defined the boundaries between the U.S. and the Spanish colonies. The treaty guaranteed the United States navigation rights on the Mississippi River. Slave code Upon taking up his post he had to deal with the Mina uprising in the vicinity of New Roads. Having assumed office just after the first stages of the Haitian Revolution, Carondelet was concerned that mistreatment of slaves might provoke additional rebellions in Louisiana; hence, he promptly introduced a slave code giving some protection to the slaves, which prescribed standards for quantity and quality of food and clothing. This initiative created a certain amount of tension between him and the slaveholders. Carondelet responded by developing a stronger relationship with the slave and free-colored populations. He commissioned 29 free men of color in the militia and was proud of the three companies he formed with soldiers of African descent. =President of the Real Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador) (1799 - 1807)= After his term in Louisiana, Carondelet served as President of the Real Audiencia de Quito from 1799 through his death in 1807, supervising territory including present-day Ecuador, parts of Peru and Colombia. He was known as a moderate person who refrained from the arrogance and arbitrary behavior so often associated with functionaries. In 1803 he assisted the naturalists Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland during their visit to Quito. An educated man with progressive interests, he also helped the naturalist and geographer Francisco Jos√© de Caldas and the orator Jos√© Mej√≠a Lequerica. In 1803, Indian insurrections took place in Guamote, Columbe and Yaruquies. Carondolet awarded the Cacique de Lic√°n, Jos√© Leandro Zepla y Oro, with a position as the Regidor del Cabildo de Riobamba in 1805, for his loyalty during these uprisings. Carondolet improved the road to Guayaquil, and was a patron of the construction of the dome of the Cathedral of Quito. After his death on August 10, 1807, he was interred at the Cathedral. Namesakes in North and South America * The Carondelet Canal in New Orleans was constructed on his orders and named for him.

Carondelet was chopped off and closed on its way to the river bank to permit the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad to build yards and station facilities. The stub end of the street from Market eastward then lost its name when it became a part of Ross Avenue.

The Fatyanovo culture developed on the northeastern edge of the Middle Dnieper culture around 2900 BC, probably as a result of a mass migration of Corded Ware peoples from Central Europe. Expanding eastwards at the expense of the Volosovo culture, the Fatyanovo people developed copper mines in the western Urals. From 2300 BC they established settlements engaged in Bronze metallurgy, giving rise to the Balanovo culture. Although belonging to the southeastern part of the Fatyanovo horizon, the Balanovo culture is quite distinct from the rest. The Balanovo culture contributed to the formation of the Abashevo culture, which in turn contributed to the formation of the Sintashta culture. The Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture ended about 2050 BC. Its peoples were almost certainly Indo-Europeans. History =Origins= The Fatyanovo culture emerged at the northeastern edge of the Middle Dnieper culture between 2900 BC and 2,800 BC, and was probably derived from an early variant of this culture. It has been described as the chronologically latest and most northeastern culture of the wider Corded Ware horizon. It traces its origins from the west and southwest. The Fatyanovo culture has been described as a \\"genuine folk movement\\" from Central Europe in the Russian forests. Unlike other cultures of the Corded Ware horizon, the Fatyanovo culture is found beyond to borders of the earlier Funnelbeaker culture. The theory of the Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture being an intrusive one is based upon the physical type of the population (physical anthropology), flexed burial under barrows, the presence of battle- axes and ceramics. Some have argued that this culture represents the acculturation of Pit-Comb Ware culture people of this area from contacts with Corded Ware agriculturists in the West. Others have noted similarities between Fatyanovo and Catacomb culture stone battle-axes. =Distribution= The Fatyanovo culture runs from Lake Pskov in the west to the middle Volga in the east, with its northern reach in the valley of the upper Volga. The Volosovo culture of indigenous forest foragers was different in from the Fatyanovo culture its ceramics, economy, and mortuary practices. It disappeared when the Fatyanovo people pushed into the Upper and Middle Volga basin. Spreading eastward down the Volga the Fatyanovo people discovered the copper ores of the western Ural foothills, and started long term settlements in lower Kama river region. They occupied the region of the Kama‚ÄìVyatka‚ÄìVetluga interfluves where metal resources (local copper sandstone deposits) of the region were exploited. The metallurgy-based Fatyanovo settlements in this area gave rise to the Balanovo culture around 2300 BC. Although being part of the Fatyanovo horizon, the Balanovo culture is quite distinct from it. Ceramic finds indicate Balanovo coexisted with the Volosovo people (mixed Balanovo-Volosovo sites), and also displaced them. The Balanovo culture became the metallurgical heartland of the wider Fatyanovo horizon. =End= The end of the Fatyanovo- Balanovo culture is estimated at between 2050 BC and 1900 BC.. On its southeastern fringes, the Balanovo culture had contributed to the formation of the Abashevo culture.. \\"[T]he Abashevo culture belonged to the forest, not to the steppe cultural region. It was genetically related to the Fatyanovo culture and belonged to the Corded ware horizon of Northern Europe.\\". \\"The Abashevans are marked by dolichocephaly and narrow faces. This population had its roots in the Balanovo and Fatyanovo cultures on the Middle Volga...\\" This culture would play an important role in the emergence of the Sintashta culture. Characteristics =Ceramics= Fatyanovo ceramics show mixed Corded Ware/Globular Amphorae traits. The later Abashevo culture pottery looked somewhat like Fatyanovo-Balanovo Corded Ware. =Settlements= Settlements of the Fatyanovo culture are scant, and bear evidence of a degree of fortification. The villages were usually situated on the high hills of the riverbanks, consisting of several above-ground houses built from wooden logs with saddle roofs, and also joined by passages. Hundreds of sites, including both settlements and cemeteries, have been found from the Balanovo culture. In Balanovo settlements, rectangular semi-subterranean houses are known. The absence of settlements are typical of the Corded Ware horizon, and are indicative of the mobile economy of the Fatyanovo-Balanovo people. =Economy= The economy seems to be quite mobile, but then we are cautioned that domestic swine are found, which suggests something other than a mobile society. The Fatyanovo culture is viewed as introducing an economy based on domestic livestock (sheep, cattle, horse & dog) into the forest zone of Russia. The Balanovo also used draught cattle and two wheeled wagons. =Burials= As is usual with ancient cultures, our main knowledge of the Fayanovo-Balanovo culture comes from their inhumations. Shaft graves were evident, which might be lined with wood. Some three hundred cemeteries have been uncovered from the Fatyanovo culture. The largest of these contain more than a hundred burials. Some shaft graves are more than 2 m deep. The interments are otherwise in accord with Corded Ware practices, with males resting on their right side with their heads oriented towards the southwest, and females resting on their left side with their heads oriented towards the northeast. Grave goods included ornaments of animal teeth, pottery, polished stone battle-axes, and on some occasions stone mace-heads. Fatyanovo burials have been found to include bear claws and pendants of bear teeth. Similar founds have been made in the earlier Sredny Stog culture, Yamnaya culture and Catacomb culture. Some have interpreted this as a sign that the bear had a ritual-symbolic function in the Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture. Balanovo burials (like the Middle Dnieper culture) were both of the flat and kurgan type, containing individual and also mass graves. The deceased were wrapped in animal skins or birch bark and placed into wooden burial chambers in subterranean rectangular pits. Burial goods depended on sex, age, and social position. Copper axes primarily accompanied persons of high social position, stone axe-hammers were given to men, flint axes to children and women. Amulets are frequently found in the graves. Abashevo kurgans are unlike Fatyanovo flat cemeteries, although flat graves were a recognizable component of the Abashevo burial rite. =Warfare= Numerous skeletons from Fatyanovo-Balanovo cemeteries show evidence of injury, including broken bones and smashed skulls. They were certainly a warlike people. It appears that they at one point were in serious conflict with people of the Abashevo culture. =Metalwork= Local metal objects of a Central European provenance type were present in the Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture. That these metal objects were produced locally suggests the presence of skilled craftsmen. Copper ornaments and tools have been found in Balanovo burials (Chalcolithic). The Fatyanovo-Balanovo people exploited metal resources from the western Urals. Spearheads of the Fatyanovo- Balanovo culture are similar to those of the later Sintashta culture, although the Sintashta ones were larger. Physical type Physical remains of people of the Fatyanovo‚ÄìBalanovo culture have revealed that they were Europoids with dolichocephalic skulls.. \\"In the anthropological sense, the Fatyanovo culture people can be seen as a relatively homogeneous group with the greatest similarities, mostly in cranial features, to other Corded Ware cultures... Craniometric studies of skulls from the Upper Volga region reveal that the people of Fatyanovo culture are characterized by dolichocranic skulls...\\" They were powerfully built. Fatyanovo‚ÄìBalanovo skulls are very similar to those of the succeeding Abashevo culture, Sintashta culture, Srubnaya culture and Andronovo culture. Skulls of the Yamnaya culture and their direct descendants on the southern steppe are less dolichocephalic.. \\"[M]assive broad-faced proto-Europoid type is a trait of post-Mariupol‚Äô cultures, Sredniy Stog, as well as the Pit-grave culture of the Dnieper‚Äôs left bank, the Donets, and Don... During the period of the Timber-grave culture the population of the Ukraine was represented by the medium type between the dolichocephalous narrow-faced population of the Multi-roller Ware culture (Babino) and the more massive broad-faced population of the Timber-grave culture of the Volga region... The anthropological data confirm the existence of an impetus from the Volga region to the Ukraine in the formation of the Timber-grave culture. During the Belozerka stage the dolichocranial narrow-faced type became the prevalent one. A close affinity among the skulls of the Timber-grave, Belozerka, and Scythian cultures of the Pontic steppes, on the one hand, and of the same cultures of the forest-steppe region, on the other, has been shown... This proves the genetical continuity between the Iranian-speeking Scythian population and the previous Timber-grave culture population in the Ukraine... The heir of the Neolithic Dnieper-Donets and Sredniy Stog cultures was the Pit-grave culture. Its population possessed distinct Europoid features, was tall, with massive skulls... The tribes of the Abashevo culture appear in the forest-steppe zone, almost simultaneously with the Poltavka culture. The Abashevans are marked by dolichocephaly and narrow faces. This population had its roots in the Balanovo and Fatyanovo cultures on the Middle Volga, and in Central Europe... [T]he early Timber-grave culture (the Potapovka) population was the result of the mixing of different components. One type was massive, and its predecessor was the Pit-grave-Poltavka type. The second type was a dolichocephalous Europoid type genetically related to the Sintashta population... One more participant of the ethno-cultural processes in the steppes was that of the tribes of the Pokrovskiy type. They were dolichocephalous narrow-faced Europoids akin to the Abashevans and different from the Potapovkans... The majority of Timber-grave culture skulls are dolichocranic with middle-broad faces. They evidence the significant role of Pit-grave and Poltavka components in the Timber-grave culture population... One may assume a genetic connection between the populations of the Timber- grave culture of the Urals region and the Alakul‚Äô culture of the Urals and West Kazakhstan belonging to a dolichocephalous narrow-face type with the population of the Sintashta culture... [T]he western part of the Andronovo culture population belongs to the dolichocranic type akin to that of the Timber-grave culture. Language Mallory associates the Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture with Indo-European migrations. Fatyanovo migrations correspond to regions with hydronyms of a Baltic language dialect mapped by linguists as far as the Oka river and the upper Volga. Thus, the migrations of the Fatyanovo- Balanovo people might have established pre-Baltic populations in the upper Volga basin. The pre-Slavs probably developed among those peoples of the Middle-Dnieper culture who stayed behind. Genetics , pre-published at bioRxiv in July 2020, examined 24 individuals of the Fatyanovo culture. All 14 samples belonged to subclades of Y-haplogroup R1a-M417. Six samples could be further specified to haplogroup R1a2-Z93.. \\"[W]e turned to the Bronze Age Fatyanovo Culture individuals and determined that their maternal (subclades of mtDNA hg U5, U4, U2e, H, T, W, J, K, I and N1a) and paternal (chrY hg R1a-M417) lineages... were ones characteristic of CWC individuals elsewhere in Europe... Interestingly, in all individuals for which the chrY hg could be determined with more depth (n=6), it was R1a2-Z93... a lineage now spread in Central and South Asia, rather than the R1a1-Z283 lineage that is common in Europe... On the PCA, the Fatyanovo individuals (and the Estonian CWC individual) group together with many European Late Neolithic/Bronze Age (LNBA) and Steppe Middle/Late Bronze Age (MLBA) individuals on top of modern Northern and Eastern Europeans.. Fatyanovo individuals are most similar to LNBA Steppe ancestry populations from Central Europe, Scandinavia and the Eastern Baltic.\\" Haplogroup R1a2-Z93 is today prevalent in Central Asia and South Asia rather than in Europe. The 24 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to various subclades of maternal haplogroups U5, U4, U2e, H, T, W, J, K, I and N1a. Both the paternal and maternal lineages of the examined Fatyanovo individuals were characteristic of the Corded Ware culture. They were mostly of steppe ancestry with slight Early European Farmer (EEF) admixture.. \\"The Fatyanovo Culture people were the first farmers in the area and the arrival of the culture has been associated with migration... This is supported by our results as the Stone Age HG and the Bronze Age Fatyanovo individuals are genetically clearly distinguishable... [T]he Fatyanovo Culture individuals (similarly to other CWC people) have mostly Steppe ancestry, but also some EF ancestry which was not present in the area before and thus excludes the northward migration of Yamnaya Culture people with only Steppe ancestry as the source of Fatyanovo Culture population. The strongest connections for Fatyanovo Culture in archaeological material can be seen with the Middle Dnieper Culture... These findings suggest present-day Ukraine as the possible origin of the migration leading to the formation of the Fatyanovo Culture and of the Corded Ware cultures in general... [I]t has been suggested that the Fatyanovo Culture people admixed with the local Volosovo Culture HG after their arrival in European Russia. Our results do not support this as they do not reveal more HG ancestry in the Fatyanovo people compared to other CWC groups or any visible change in ancestry proportions during the period covered by our samples.\\" They were most closely related to Late Neolithic and Bronze Age populations of Central Europe, Scandinavia and the eastern Baltic, and also grouped together with modern Northern and Eastern Europeans. Around a third of the samples had blue eyes and/or blond hair, while the rest had brown eyes and black or brown hair.. \\"[A]round a third of the Fatyanovo individuals had blue eyes and/or blond hair...\\" The genetics of the people of the Fatyanovo culture was found to be substantially different from preceding Volosovo culture, with whom they do not appear to have mixed. Their EEF admixture has not been detected in the earlier Yamnaya culture, suggesting that the Fatyaovo people did not directly descend from the Yamnaya. The authors of the study suggested that the Fatyanovo culture emerged through a rapid migration towards the north-east from the Middle Dnieper culture of modern-day Ukraine and Belarus.

This family consists of bottom-dwelling marine sculpins shaped like tadpoles, with large heads and bodies that taper back into small, flat tails. The skin is loosely attached and movable, and the layer underneath it is gelatinous. The eyes are placed high on the head, focused forward closer to the tip of the snout. Members of the family generally have small, leaf-like pectoral fins and lack scales, although some species are covered with soft spines. This is important to the species as the depths in which they live are low pressure and they are ambush/opportunistic/foraging predators that do not expend energy unless they are forced to. The blobfish has a long, broad tongue and conical teeth that are largely recurved and are arranged in bands in irregular rows along the premaxillaries; canines are completely absent. Teeth are nonexistent on the palatines and vomer; which make up the hard palate. The blobfish also has a set of specialized pharyngeal teeth that are well developed and paired evenly along the upper and lower portions of the pharyngeal arch. These specialized teeth may aid in the breakdown of food due to the very strategic dependency on whatever food falls from above., McCulloch, Allan. 1914.

The adults live on the sea floor, between deep, The intense biological pressure to conserve energy within deep sea fish seems to be true across many species; most of them are long lived, have a slow rate of reproduction, growth, and aging. The reproduction strategy of Psychrolutidae is similar to that of other sculpins of the family Cottoidea. In this case the blobfish can live to be roughly 130 years old. Categorized as the predator of the deep sea they have no real predatorily issues; a big help to aid in their energy saving. Their name is derived from the Greek psychrolouteo, meaning \\"to have a cold bath\\". They tend to live in colder waters, although some range into warm-temperate seas. The blob sculpin, Psychrolutes phrictus, exhibits complex nesting behaviors complete with egg guarding. Reproductively the blobfish have been seen gathering in large numbers to lay their pinkish eggs in a single surrounding nesting area. The number of eggs laid within one nest can range from 9,000 to 108,000. Another observation of the parental care of the blobfish is that their eggs resemble being clean. It is believed that as the female blobfish hover around the nests they also clean them and remove any sand or dirt.

The original version of the character is depicted as the last survivor of his species in the 31st century, and is a founding member of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team from the Marvel Multiverse alternate reality known as Earth-691. Yondu in Earth-691 is depicted as a blue-skinned male with a large red fin protruding from the back of his head and his back; he is a spiritual warrior who can control his killing arrows via sound waves, most commonly by whistling. Yondu joined Vance Astro and other survivors of the Badoon attack on Earth's solar system in the 31st Century, who became known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. As part of the Guardians, Yondu traveled to present-day Earth and became an honorary member of the Avengers. The original Yondu never starred as a solo character in any Marvel Comic books, but was a core member of the team in the Guardians of the Galaxy comic that ran from 1990 to 1995. A second version of Yondu appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), where he is a space pirate leading one of the factions of \\"The Ravagers\\", portrayed by Michael Rooker. After the release of the first film, Marvel Comics introduced a comic book version of the character to the Earth-616 comic book continuity. The present day Yondu character has appeared in the Guardians of the Galaxy animated TV series and as a playable character in video games. Publication history The Earth-691 version of Yondu first appeared in Marvel Super-Heroes #18 (January 1969). According to Roy Thomas, all of the original Guardians of the Galaxy were created in a conference between Arnold Drake and Stan Lee, but it remains uncertain whether each individual character was created by Drake, Lee, or both. Yondu appeared along with the rest of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team in the 2014 series Guardians 3000. Writer Dan Abnett described him as \\"the instinct\\" of the team. The Earth-616 version of Yondu first appeared in Star-Lord #2 and was created by Sam Humphries and Javier Garron. Fictional character biography =Earth-691= Yondu Udonta is a member of the Zatoan tribe, primitive beings native to Centauri IV. He functions as a hunter. His homeworld was the first planet to be colonized by humans that was outside Earth's solar system. Yondu is born in the late 30th century. Yondu's people had fled from contact with overwhelming Earth colonizers who had begun arriving in 2940 A.D. In 3006 A.D., Vance Astro, an astronaut from Earth, lands on Yondu's planet with an antiquated propulsion ship. Vance encounters Yondu during the latter's trial of manhood. Yondu attacks him, but is repelled by Vance's powers. Vance keeps this secret as Yondu's action was illegal. Yondu works with Vance when the Badoon, an alien race, overtakes the planet later that year. All the other Centaurians are believed to have been slaughtered. Vance and Yondu escape in his ship to fetch help but the Badoon capture them easily. The duo are taken to Earth which, by 3007 A.D., has also been conquered. When questioned, Vance pretends to be unfriendly with Yondu. They later escape and team up with Charlie-27 of the Jupiter colony and Martinex of the Pluto colony, forming the Guardians of the Galaxy to fight the Badoon.Marvel Super-Heroes #18 For the next seven years, the four survivors attack the Badoon's outposts in the solar system.

Since his newfound people will not accept his bionic weapon-hand, Yondu allows the Guardians to use their advanced medical technology to restore his flesh-and-blood hand. During their farewells, Vance apologizes for what he had thought was unacceptable treatment of Yondu during their earlier adventurers.Guardians of the Galaxy Annual #2 =Earth-616= The Earth-616 version of Yondu has been identified by writer Sam Humphries as \\"the great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather of the Yondu in the original Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians 3000.\\"Richards, Dave (October 22, 2015). \\"Humphries & Garron Chronicle the Legendary Rise of 'Star-Lord'\\".

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities As a member of the marsupial alien race of the planet Centauri IV, Yondu possesses an intuitive mystical \\"sixth sense\\" perception that permits him limited empathic relationships with other lifeforms. The higher the lifeform, the more limited is his empathic potential. Additionally, Yondu possesses an intuitive rapport with nature, particularly with his own world, but also with any world that still possesses natural wildlife. With this rapport, he can sense incongruous elements (foreign bodies or substances) or focus on specific elements within the whole (such as the location of a given plant). He is also sensitive to mystical beings and forces and is able to detect their presence and activities without effort. By going into a trance, Yondu is able to replenish his own inner strength by communing with natural forces. Yondu is an above average physical specimen of his race. He has slightly more strength and endurance than the average human male. As a hunter, Yondu is an expert in the use of bow and arrow. His ability to whistle with a range of four octaves aids his archery (see Weapons, below). The native Centaurian language is a system of grunts, clicks, and whistles, but Yondu has managed to master the English language, although it is painful for him to speak for too long without resting his throat. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled hunter and tracker. He has extensive knowledge of the social and religious customs of the natives of Centauri IV. =Weapons= Yondu uses a single curve bow and a quiver of arrows composed of yaka, a special sound-sensitive metal found only on Centauri IV. A yaka arrow can actually change its trajectory in response to certain high-octave whistle- sounds some Centaurians can produce. Yondu is so skillful at controlling his arrows, he can cause an arrow to return to his hand or weave its way through a crowd of people without touching them. Yondu's arrows are in length and are very flexible. He carries about 20 of them at one time. In Secret Wars, Yondu utilizes his expertise in archery by shooting \\"drone-arrows\\" to give the Guardians an eye in the sky. Yondu's right hand is replaced for a time by a bionic device called a weapons concealment appendage, a metal cup replacing his right hand. Thus, he could no longer practice archery nor perform functions requiring him to grasp with his right hand. The device can release from within itself a number of weapons, including a mace, a hatchet, a scythe, a barbed spear, and others; when not in use the weapons are concealed within the appendage at a reduced size, until enlarged by Pym particles. Yondu's bionic weapon-hand is later replaced with a duplicate of his original hand.

In this continuity, armed with a self-propelled arrow that he can control through whistling, Yondu is the leader of a clan of Ravagers, and kidnapped Peter Quill, raising him to be a Ravager. Yondu initially chases after Quill after he takes an orb artifact for himself instead of turning it over to the Ravagers. After it is revealed that the orb holds the Power Stone, and Quill and Gamora are captured by Yondu, Yondu is persuaded to aid the Guardians in stopping Ronan from using the orb to destroy Xandar with the promise of claiming the orb for himself. However, after Yondu claims the orb from Quill and departs, he learns that Quill gave him a fake that holds a Troll doll to add to his collection of small figurines, much to his amusement. Yondu and his lieutenant, Kraglin, reveal in dialogue that it was Quill's father who hired Yondu to kidnap and deliver the young Peter Quill to him, but that they decided not to deliver the boy to him because Quill's father, according to Yondu, was a \\"jackass\\". * Rooker reprised the role in the 2017 film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It is revealed that Yondu and his Ravager clan were exiled from the greater Ravager community after kidnapping Peter and Ego's other children, which broke the Ravager Code. Yondu and his crew are tasked on Contraxia by Ayesha's representatives to track down and capture the Guardians. However, Yondu decides not to capture Quill and the others and instead wants the batteries that Rocket stole from the Sovereign, which infuriates most of the other Ravagers including Taserface who initiates a mutiny, and Yondu is incarcerated with Rocket Raccoon and Groot. He has his fin destroyed in the process by Nebula, which is revealed as the technology enabling him to control his arrow. Yondu subsequently uses a larger fin that more closely resembles his appearance from the comics‚Äîidentified as the prototype for the fin he wore in the first film- which is retrieved by Groot. With help from this last loyalist Kraglin, Yondu, Rocket, and Groot escape and destroy his ship, killing all the mutineers. Yondu then helps the Guardians defeat Ego, with Rocket and Groot proclaiming him to be part of the team thanks to his actions, and sacrifices his life to save Peter's when they exit the planet's atmosphere, Yondu using the last jetpack but giving Peter the last spacesuit. It is revealed the reason he kept Quill was because he realized Ego had slain all the other children he had sired and summoned back to him and Yondu wanted to protect Peter from that end, thinking of Peter as his son. During Yondu's funeral, Peter declares Yondu his true father. Informed about Yondu's last deeds by Rocket Raccoon, Stakar and the other Ravagers salute Yondu as a hero for his self-sacrifice. =Video games= * Yondu appears in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Chris Edgerly.

Fictional character biography Sharon Smith was a member of the original Hellions recruited by Emma Frost to be a competitive team to the New Mutants and a tool for the Hellfire Club. Her character was the antithesis of Wolfsbane who could transform into a wolf. She engaged in several battles with the New Mutants‚Äîmostly petty competition‚Äîbut occasionally got along with the students, sometimes having dances to socialize. Her personality was that of a free spirit. Catseye's youth and comparative lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence. She had a photographic memory and instinctively knew when she was being lied to. Under Frost's tutelage, Smith progressed from total illiteracy to upper grade school reading levels in less than a year.New Mutants #31 She still retained several feline qualities while in human form, having been forced to provide for herself since earliest infancy. Notably, she kept her tail in many instances. Upon her first meeting with Wolfsbane, rather than attack out of an animalistic nature, she smelled Rahne and said that as shapechangers the two of them shared a kindred spirit and that they should be friends ‚Äî this in spite of the obviously played feline/canine feuding roles.New Mutants #17 Emma Frost takes advantage of the New Mutants' emotional turmoil after an incident where a cosmic being called the Beyonder had actually killed them and then brought them back to life.

The battle, held in the New Warrior's penthouse, comes down to a game of numbers, and Catseye scored one for her team by viciously defeating Night Thrasher, easily tearing through his reinforced armor. Ultimately, the Hellions lost by attrition, though nobody defeated Catseye in turn.New Warriors #9-10 (March‚ÄìApril 1991) Soon after, Emma threw another party which the Hellions as well as the X-Men Gold team attended. It was there that Trevor Fitzroy‚Äîa member of the villainous group known as the Upstarts‚Äîcrashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group.

Heberto Juan Padilla (20 January 1932 - 25 September 2000) was a Cuban poet, and the center of the so-called \\"Padilla affair\\" when he was imprisoned for criticizing the government. He was born in Puerta de Golpe, Pinar del R√≠o, Cuba. His first book of poetry, Las rosas audaces (The Audacious Roses), was published in 1949. After his first marriage to Bertha Hernandez with whom he had three children, Giselle, Maria and Carlos Padilla, he married poet Belkis Cuza Mal√© in 1972. His son, Ernesto Padilla, was born in 1972.  Padilla's Imprisonment  Although Padilla initially supported the revolution led by Fidel Castro, by the late 1960s he began to criticize it openly and in 1971, he was imprisoned by the Castro regime. Padilla's criticism of the Castro Regime was prompted by the changing role of the writer in the new revolutionary society of Cuba, and the brewing hostilities between Cuban cultural bureaucrats and the Cuban writers. During the 1950s, writers in Cuba had shown strength and vigor in the production of cultural institutions and creative material, including the Casa de las Am√©ricas and the publication of Lunes de Revoluci√≥n. However, cultural bureaucrats had begun to be more critical towards art produced, and banned the movie P.M., a film about night life in Cuba. This perpetuated already existing distrust between the Popular Socialist Party, and Lunes de Revoluci√≥n, who had sponsored the television platform that P.M. was shown on. Following this crisis, the writers of Lunes de Revoluci√≥n, among other Cuban writers, were invited to a series of discussions at the National Library, where leaders of the PSP accused them of being divisive and not truly socialist. The heated nature of these debates demanded the intervention of Fidel Castro, himself, who then, in this speech, outlined the government's cultural policy: there will be tolerance towards all forms of artistic expression, as long as there was a basic support for the Revolution. Padilla began to get frustrated with the growing government interference in cultural affairs. In 1968, this underlying tension manifested in a debate published in the cultural magazine, El Caim√°n Barbudo, where Padilla wrote a scathing critique of Lisandro Otero's Pasi√≥n de Urbino, a novel that was considered for the Spanish Biblioteca Breve award, but was beat out by Tres Triste Tigres by Guillermo Cabrera Infante. In Padilla's article, he denounces Pasi√≥n de Urbino, as well as its bureaucratic author, Otero, who was the Vice President of the Cultural Council. Padilla proceeded to praise Tres Triste Tigres, calling it one of the most brilliant, ingenious and profoundly Cuban novels ever written. Therefore, Padilla not only attacked, Otero, a high-ranking cultural official but praised Cabrera Infante, who had publicly condemned the Revolution and the conditions of writers within Cuba, dangerously branding Padilla as an ally to traitor to the Revolution. Following this scandal, the editorial board of El Caim√°n Barbudo that published this debate was fired and Padilla had also lost his job working at the Granma, or one of the government sanctioned news outlets in Cuba. Padilla's frustration was only exacerbated when the Cuban Union of Writers and Artists, or the UNEAC, awarded the \\"Juli√°n de Casal\\" to Heberto Padilla's collection of critical poems, Fuera del juego in 1968, which would allow it to be published and distributed to the public. Before Fuera del juego was published, the UNEAC had heavily criticized the decision, and underwent a series of discussions about the counterrevolutionary nature of the book. The series of poems contained blatant revolutionary skepticism, especially in the poem titled Fuera del juego, where he outlines the difference between a good revolutionary and a bad revolutionary. Although the poem, as well as the book, presents a critical stance on the Revolution, it does so to prevent the Revolution from \\"supra-bureacracy or militarization\\". The decision, however, was upheld, and Fuera del juego was published with a political disclaimer, but the criticisms of Padilla's work did not halt here. A series of articles were posted in Verde Olivo, the magazine of the armed forces, under the name Leopaldo Avila, prompting a stricter outline of the government's cultural policy. The conditional tolerance of Cuban literature required more than just a basic support for the Revolution. Thus a declaration of principles was created and approved at the Congress of Writers and Artists in 1968 that further defined the role of the writer in Cuba, stating that the writer has to not only support the Revolution, but contribute to it through utilizing literature as a \\"weapon against weakness and problems which, directly or indirectly, could hinder this advance.\\" With the strengthening of the overall cultural policy of the Cuban government in an attempt to avoid the weakening of the Revolutionary ideology, vigilance towards Cuban writers had increased, punishing them for even slightly deviating from Castro's communist praxis. Thus on March 20, 1971, Heberto Padilla was arrested and jailed for his work, Fuera del juego. To illustrate the trivial nature of revolutionary vigilance, one of the charges brought against Fuera del juego was Padilla's conception of history, where he described time as a circle. This was seen as counterrevolutionary. In UNEAC's official point of view, they stated, \\"He has expressed his anti-historical attitude by means of exalting individualism in opposition to collective demands of a country in the midst of historical development and by also stating his idea of time as a reoccurring a repeating circle instead of an ascending line.\\" Padilla was released thirty-seven days after being imprisoned, but not before delivering a statement of self- criticism to a UNEAC meeting. In this statement he had confessed to the charges brought against him, describing himself to be what his adversaries accused him of being: a counterrevolutionary, subtle, insidious, and malignant. He had also accused other writers, including his own wife, and urged them to follow his lead of conforming to the Revolutionary society.  Controversy of Padilla's Imprisonment  After Padilla's statement of self- criticism, a number of prominent Latin American, North American, and European intellectuals, including Mario Vargas Llosa, Julio Cort√°zar, Susan Sontag, and Jean-Paul Sartre, spoke out against Padilla's incarceration, and the resulting controversy came to be known as \\"the Padilla affair.\\" Though Padilla was released from prison, he was still not allowed to leave the country until 1980.  Personal life  He lived in New York, Washington, D.C. and Madrid, before finally settling in Princeton, NJ. Padilla was a Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Farrar Straus & Giroux published several editions of his poetry, a novel, En mi jard√≠n pastan los h√©roes (translated as Heroes Are Grazing in My Garden), and a book of memoirs, La mala memoria (translated as Self-Portrait of the Other). He was the Elena Amos Distinguished Scholar in Latin American Studies at Columbus State University, Columbus GA, 1999‚Äì2000. He died on 25 September 2000 while teaching at Auburn University in Alabama.

Padillas poem, ‚ÄúIn Trying Times‚Äù is a tribute to the struggles that the Cuban people faced during the time of Castro‚Äôs leadership. This poem uses many metaphors to portray different rights that the citizens of Cuba had striped away from them. Two of these metaphors include ‚Äúturn his tongue over to them‚Äù and ‚Äútake a walk.‚Äù One of the metaphors that is important in this piece is ‚Äúturn your tongue over to them. (In Trying Times)‚Äù Colleen Sweeney states that ‚ÄúNone of those rights is a match for the right to speak out.‚Äù In other words the right to speak up and out is more important than any other right because it allows us to testify what is right and what is wrong. We take for granted the ability to speak out, not everyone has this luxury. We should use this liberty to better our country and do what is fair and just. Heberto Padilla used his right to speak and was accused with treason which led to his jail time and later his exile. However, he never stopped trying even though he had lost everything. Another metaphor that is used in ‚ÄúIn Trying Times‚Äù is ‚Äútake a walk.‚Äù Celestine Bohem says ‚Äú[Padilla‚Äôs] criticism of Fidel Castro's rule landed him first in jail and later in exile.‚Äù This elucidates to the fact that Padilla was held captive and forced out of his home for most of his life, despite the fact that he did nothing wrong. This is ironic because the government is ‚Äúbegging‚Äù him to ‚Äútake a walk‚Äù despite the fact that Padilla and the citizens of Cuba are being held hostage. Imagine being bottled up, forced to speak about things that are not true, and kicked out of your home. This is what Padilla had to deal with throughout his life. ‚ÄúIn Trying Times‚Äù helped show the people of Cuba that despite the fact that he was being tortured he never gave up. As one can see, Heberto Padillas' life was a very difficult one. However Padilla was able to use those challenges to write poetry that is still talked about today. ‚ÄúIn Trying Times‚Äù used metaphors to tell the citizens of Cuba and others what was going on and how he felt about the situation. We should use the abilities and rights that we have to better our community because, as shown, not everyone has that opportunity.

Area codes 518 and 838 are telephone area codes serving the northeasternmost part of the \\"upstate\\" part of New York in the United States. 518 was established as one of the original area codes during 1947. 838 was added as an overlay during 2017. It covers 24 counties and 1,200 ZIP Codes. There are 493 landline and 100 wireless exchanges served by 47 carriers. It is the largest area code in size in New York, extending from the eastern Mohawk Valley to the Vermont border, and from the Canada‚ÄìUS border to south of Albany. The bulk of the area code's population is in the Capital District (the vicinity of the cities Albany, Schenectady, and Troy). Other cities in the area code are Glens Falls, Plattsburgh, and Saratoga Springs. History 518 is the only one of New York's original five Numbering Plan Areas that still has its original boundaries. Despite the presence of the Capital District and the proliferation of pagers and cellphones (particularly in the Capital District and Glens Falls), it was one of the few remaining original area codes (not counting those serving an entire state) that had never been divided or overlaid. By the spring of 2016, however, 518 was on the verge of depletion, and it was projected that the region would need another area code by 2019 at the latest. By the autumn, however, it was anticipated that 518 would be depleted during the third quarter of 2017. An overlay area code, 838, was approved quickly, to be implemented during the autumn of 2017. From March 18 to August 19, 2017, telephone calls could be made using 7 digits or 10 digits (area code + 7 digit number). 10-digit dialing became mandatory on August 20, 2017, with recorded messages reminding callers if they dialed incorrectly. On September 19, 2017, area code 838 was officially added as an overlay to area code 518 making this the second overlay in the upstate region.Farrell, Michael P. \\"New 838 area code will be phased in starting this month\\" .

The character is usually depicted with abilities to control emotion in other people. Publication history Empath was created by Chris Claremont and Sal Buscema and first appeared in New Mutants #16-17 (June‚ÄìJuly 1984) as a member of Emma Frost's original Hellions. Fictional character biography =Hellions= Empath was born in Castile, Spain. He is a mutant in the Marvel universe who attended school at the Massachusetts Academy, where he was one of the original students of then-villain, the White Queen. Frost's students, who were known as the Hellions, were rivals of Charles Xavier's students, the New Mutants. Manuel fancied Frost so much that during the night, he attempted to read her mind but she noticed instantly, deciding to show him everything about her. Empath described her as cold as ice. De la Rocha was one of the few Hellions, along with James Proudstar, Amara Aquilla, and Angelica Jones to survive an attack by time-travelling villain Trevor Fitzroy (although Empath's former teammate, Tarot would eventually be resurrected). The White Queen once used Empath to manipulate Magneto into allowing the New Mutants to join the Hellions. This was made easier as the New Mutants had been deeply traumatized by a powerful energy being called the Beyonder. During the course of this plan, he met two of Xavier's allies, Tom Corsi and Sharon Friedlander. He took the opportunity to attack them mentally, changing a subtle attraction to full blown obsessive sexual desire between the two. They would show up several days later, severely traumatized.New Mutants Vol. 1 #38 During his tenure with the Hellions, de la Rocha met and fell in love with Amara Aquilla, the New Mutant known as Magma. Aquilla eventually left her team and became a member of the Hellions, so that she could be close to de la Rocha, and de la Rocha even accompanied her back to her home in Nova Roma. The romance ended, however, when Aquilla began to suspect that de la Rocha was using his abilities to control her emotions, which he in fact was. When the colony of Nova Roma was discovered to be a ruse by the witch Selene, Empath used his abilities for a time to convince Magma that this was a hoax. This set a bond of mistrust between the two that would never be broken. =X-Corporation= Later, Empath joined X-Corporation, where he became the Communications Director for the Corporation's Los Angeles chapter along with his former love Magma. However, after M-Day, Cyclops ordered the closure of the X-Corporation headquarters to better focus all available resources on protecting their members and allies. Empath was one of the few mutants to retain their powers in the wake of House of M. =M-Day= After M-Day, Emma Frost used Empath immediately to reel in Magma who, in her devastation over the death of her boyfriend because of the decimation, had wrecked a South American village. Empath stayed at the Xavier Institute along with some of the other 198, however his shared history with Magma makes her suspicious that he is still toying with her emotions. Later, when Johnny Dee uses his powers to control Magma and Leech and make them kill Mister M, Amara becomes aware that someone was controlling her, and, thinking it is Empath, blames him. =Manifest Destiny= Empath resurfaces in San Francisco leading a new group of regular humans calling themselves the Hellfire Cult who are conducting vicious attacks on mutants, despite him retaining his own mutant powers. However, he himself appears to be under the control of a mysterious woman called the Red Queen, with whom he shares an S&M; sexual relationship. In the next issue she asks him about Emma Frost and then telepathically makes herself appear as Emma Frost as she sexually dominates Empath. When the X-Men discover the Hellfire Cult's base, she flees leaving Empath behind.Uncanny X-Men #502 Empath makes a run for it, and his powers seem to be going out of control. While being chased by various X-Men, he takes them down until Pixie appears and beats him savagely. She then stabs him in the head with her soulknife, weakening his powers and blinding him.Uncanny X-Men #503 He is held in prison- like quarters in the X-Men's HQ, frustrated over his condition and angry against the X-Men. Despite this and the deeds he has committed against her friends and herself, Amara takes pity upon him; hers is the only company Empath accepts.New Mutants Vol. 3 #1 It is later revealed that Empath was meant to be a Trojan Horse, whose rejuvenated powers disabled many of the X-Men, while the Red Queen and her Sisterhood took a locket of Jean Grey's hair. Pixie then attacked him again with her soulknife, shattering his consciousness.Uncanny X-Men #510 =Necrosha= Empath was moved to the X-Men's new Utopia prison, made out of Asteroid M, alongside Sebastian Shaw and Donald Pierce. He was trapped in a psychic illusion where he is with Amara, before the illusion is shattered when Selene's minions appear on Utopia's shores.Necrosha one-shot =Dawn of X= Empath is later seen on Krakoa where he uses his powers to wreak havoc by manipulating his fellow Hellions into fighting each other, and also anyone who comes in his way, and as a result, he is assessed by the island's scientists and psychics. To their horror, they learned Empath is not a violent sociopath with an X-gene; rather, his X-gene transformed him into a violent sociopath. Because most people learn right or wrong by observing the reactions of others, swiftly realizing that negative behavior generates painful responses, when his X-gene activated at an unusually young age, it colored his natural development and psychological growth, so Empath had no way of learning these lessons. No matter what he did, no matter how much pain he caused, he only had to flex his mind and he would receive love and adulation. There were no consequences of abusing his powers, of taking advantage of others, and so he never had a way to learn right from wrong. Environmental cause and effect, the emotional data the mind requires to understand others, disappeared. As other mutants, whose powers are violent by nature, are also becoming a little out of control, the Quiet Council meet to discuss this matter, and the decision is to task Sinister with gathering a team to send into \\"therapeutic\\" missions where they are allowed to actually use their powers. The team's first mission is to destroy the now abandoned clone farm that Sinister left under the orphanage where Alex and Scott lived. Hellions (Vol. 2) #1 After the team enters the orphanage, Empath starts fooling around with Nanny's emotions which leads to her trying to 'nurse' Greycrow. Psylocke calls him out on it, but Greycrow has another answer to Manuel and shoots him straight in the head.Hellions (Vol. 2) #2 Powers and abilities Empath possesses the psionic ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others. He can affect large groups of individuals at a time and can exert varying levels of empathic control over them, ranging from subtle manipulations that others are generally unaware of, to a complete negation of emotion that reduces them to a zombie-like state in which he can command them with little effort. His power operates by means of Empath's own brainwaves overriding the parts of the brain that govern emotion in others. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Empath was held hostage by Mikhail Rasputin, who attached the young mutant to a computer system in order to amplify his empathic abilities to control the human population of Eurasia. This caused Empath incredible agony, and when his handler, Keeper Murdock (the Age of Apocalypse's version of Daredevil), accidentally touched him, Murdock realized the horrific pain the young man was in and ended his life.

He recorded much of his master's teachings. After Vital's death, his writings began to spread and led to a \\"powerful impact on various circles throughout the Jewish world.\\"Fine 2003, p. 2 Early life Born in Safed, as a young boy Hayyim Vital was educated by the scholar Rabbi Moshe Alshich. Rabbi Joseph Karo is said to have paid special attention to Vital's early talents and in 1557 requested that Alshich take special care in his education as he was destined to succeed his teacher in the world of Torah study. That same year, Vital first became acquainted with the kabbalist Isaac Luria, who would have a lasting influence on him. Vital apparently married at a young age. It was an unhappy marriage, and when he left his wife, the prophet Elijah appeared to him in a dream and led him to a beautiful garden, where he saw the pious of all ages, in the form of birds, flying through the garden and studying the Mishnah. In the center of the garden was God seated on a throne that was surrounded by the pious, resting on elaborate tapestries. Convinced by this vision that he was destined to become a kabbalist, Vital devoted the following two and a half years to the study of alchemy. Upon completing his studies, Elijah appeared to him again in a vision, and told him that he would succeed in his efforts and write a commentary on the Zohar. Study with Cordovero When Luria arrived in Safed, Rabbi Moses ben Jacob Cordovero had been the principal figure in the kabbalistic community for numerous years. \\"Cordovero was the teacher of what appears to have been a relatively loose knit circle of disciples. The most important were Elijah de Vidas, Abraham Galante, Moses Galante, Hayyim Vital, Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim, Elazar ben Moshe Azikri, Samuel Gallico, and an important kabbalist who studied with Cordovero for a short while in the 1560s, Mordechai Dato.\\"Fine 2003, p. 80-81 There's evidence to suggest that Isaac Luria also regarded Moses Cordovero as his teacher. Joseph Sambari (1640-1703), an important Egyptian chronicler, testified that Cordovero was 'the Ari's teacher for a very short time.'Sambari 1673, p. 64 Luria probably arrived in early 1570, and Cordovero died on June 27 that year (the 23d day of Tammuz). Bereft of their most prominent authority and teacher, the kabbalists looked for new guidance, and Isaac Luria helped fill the vacuum left by Cordovero's passing. Student of Isaac Luria In 1570 Vital became a student of Isaac Luria, the foremost kabbalist of the day. In a study of Lurianic mysticism, Lawrence Fine writes: > Vital provides us with the names of 38 individuals who according to him, > made up Luria's discipleship... According to him, the fellowship was divided > into four hierarchically ordered groups. The first and most important, was > composed of 11 men, listed in this order: Hayyim Vital, Jonathan Sagis, > Joseph Arzin, Isaac Kohen, Gedaliah ha-Levi, Samuel Uceda, Judah Mishan, > Abraham Gavriel, Shabbatai Menashe, Joseph ibn Tabul, and Elijah Falko (or > Falkon). It is largely accepted that within a year Hayyim Vital emerged as the leading student, so that when the Arizal died in 1572, at the age of 38, Vital succeeded him. Since the Arizal had left almost none of his teachings in writing, Vital began to write down everything he had learned from his master. Exile and return Hayyim Vital arrived in Egypt in 1577, but soon returned to Ottoman Syria, settling in the village of Ein Zeitim (near Safed), and later in Jerusalem. After that he went to live in Damascus, where he became the head of the Sicilian Jewish community In Damascus he began writing his first work of his own. The greater part of the book consists of an exposition on the conjuring of clouds and a discourse on the seven wandering stars (planets), the Seven Heavens, and their corresponding metals. Upon completing his book, Vital returned to Jerusalem, where his former teacher, Moshe Alshich, ordained him \\"in the 1590s.\\"Fine 2003, p. 52 After a time, however, Vital left Jerusalem for Safed, where he fell sick and was bedridden for an entire year. He also authored Shaar HaGilgulim, a kabbalistic work on reincarnation, which became one of the Shemonah She'arim (see below). Etz Hayyim During this illness Rabbi Yehoshua, his closest follower, who had accompanied Vital on nearly every journey, and managed to bribe Vital's younger brother, Rabbi Moshe, with 500 gold coins to lend him Vital's writings, which were kept locked in a box. Rabbi Moshe accordingly brought Yehoshua a large part of the manuscripts, and 100 copyists were immediately engaged: in just three days, they were able to reproduce more than 600 pages. Although according to some reports Vital, upon learning of this, claimed that the papers which has been copied were not his own writings, they were rapidly disseminated. The writings in question purported to contain the teachings of the Luria rather than Vital's independent work. The first printed edition was in eight volumes, known as the Shemonah She'arim, and this version is still used by some Kabbalists in the Sephardi world. The best known recension was published later under the title Etz Hayyim (\\"Tree of Life\\"), in which the topics were arranged in a more systematic order, and the parts on ritual (the Peri Etz Hayyim) were kept separate from the parts on the underlying theology.There now exists an edition of Vital's works in 15 volumes containing both recensions. In addition to a tribute to the Luria, the work contains the assertion that it is one of God's greatest pleasures to witness the promotion of the teaching of the Kabbalah, since this alone can assure the coming of the Jewish Messiah. However, Vital still held the teachings of his former teacher, kabbalist Moses Cordovero, in high esteem. He maintained that Cordovero often appeared to him in dreams. One of the most prominent of Vital's opponents was Menahem Lonzano, who publicly denounced him in his work Imrei Emet. Later life and death On 20 Elul 1590, Vital received rabbinical ordination from his teacher Moshe Alshich. Four years later, in 1594, he settled permanently in Damascus, where he lectured every evening on the kabbalah. In 1604 Vital's sight began to fail; in 1620 he died while preparing to return to Safed. He was 77.

The design, intended to be built in Chicago, included 528 stories, with a gross area of . Wright stated that there would be parking for 15,000 cars and 100 helicopters. If built, it would top the list of the tallest buildings in the world by far, being more than four times the height of the Empire State Building, and twice as tall as the world's current tallest building, the Burj Khalifa and about 730 meters taller than Jeddah Tower, both designed by Adrian Smith and which designs are said to have been inspired by that of The Illinois.Burj Dubai & The Illinois ComparisonDubai Debt: What the Burj Kahlifa‚Äîthe tallest building in the world‚Äîowes to Frank Lloyd Wright., By Witold Rybczynski, Slate.com, Jan 13, 2010 Technical feasibility Wright believed that it would have been technically possible to construct such a building even at the time it was proposed. At the time, the tallest skyscraper in the world was New York's Empire State Building, at less than a quarter the height suggested for the Illinois. It probably would have been possible to erect a self-supporting steel structure of the required height, but there are a number of problems that occur when a building is that tall. The material used to build tall towers at the time, steel, is quite flexible. This allows towers to sway substantially in the wind, causing discomfort for occupants of the higher floors. Though Wright acknowledged this problem in his original proposal, he believed the tripod design of this tower (similar to that of the CN Tower, which was not designed until a decade after Wright's death) combined with its tensioned steel frame and the integral character of its structural components would counteract any oscillation. This also could have been solved by placing a tuned mass damper somewhere within the tower as was done in the Citigroup Center and Taipei 101, although this design innovation was not well known until decades later. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw substantial increases in the load-bearing strength of concrete, making it possible to build entirely in this stiff material. Wright explained that there would be 76 elevators, each having five-floor-high tandem cabs, serving blocks of five floors simultaneously. The 76 elevators would be divided into five banks or groups, with each elevator group serving a hundred-floor segment of the building. Wright's floor plan of the 528th floor shows it would be served by only one elevator shaft. The elevators were to be \\"atomic powered\\", capable of mile-per-minute speeds, and running on ratchets instead of suspended by cables. But a realistic design would be powered by a \\"third rail\\" like subways. The elevator banks extend beyond the sloping exterior walls at various points, giving the building the appearance of an elongated pyramid with protruding parapets. He said these elevators would enable the building to be evacuated in one hour, in combination with escalators that would serve the five lowest floors. In his 1957 book, A Testament, Wright described the proposed structure with floor plans of the \\"base\\", 320th, and 528th (highest) floors. The floor plan for the 320th floor shows a single, open staircase, not separated from the surrounding office space in any way, not even with a door. The floor plan of the 528th floor shows that access is solely by a single elevator, with no staircase at all. Wright believed that because his building was fireproof, any fire precautions would be moot. Cultural references *Fang Island released a song called \\"The Illinois\\" on their 2010 self-titled album that was inspired by the design. *In 2014, Chicago-based Goose Island Brewery began bottling an IPA named The Illinois in honor of Wright's design, with label art featuring a hop cone design rendered to appear as if it were one of the architect's trademark stained glass windows.

The Greek name Hekatompylos means \\"one hundred gates\\" and the Persian term has the same meaning. The title was commonly used for cities which had more than the traditional four gates. It may be understood better as the \\"Many Gated\\". Most scholars locate it at Sahr -e Qumis, in the Qumis region in west Khurasan, Iran. Alexander the Great stopped here in the summer of 330 BCE and it became part of the Seleucid Empire after his death. The Parni tribe took the city around 237 BCE and made it one of the first capitals of their Parthian Empire. It was mentioned as the royal city of the Parthians by a number of classical writers including Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy, although the Parthians seemed to have used a number of cities as their \\"capital\\" at different periods. Qumis was destroyed by an earthquake in 856 AD, and it was probably abandoned afterwards. The site of this ancient city is now called ≈†ahr-e Qumis (), between Semnan and Damqan in the Semnan Province. In 2011 plans for an \\"International Project of Tourism & Recreational City\\" were published, using the name of Hecatompylos. The project envisions using an area of close to the city of Damghan, which would place the resort at about northeast of the historic site. Citations References * De Quincey, Thomas (1821).

The Chinmaya Mission was established in India in 1953 by devotees of the renowned Vedanta teacher Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati. Administered by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust in Mumbai, India, the mission was later headed by Swami Tejomayananda and is now headed by Swami Swaroopananda. There are over 313 mission centres all over India and abroad. North America had more than 30 centres.today it has over 300 centres across the world.. Times of India, December 25, 2001. It is currently administered by Central Chinmaya Mission Trust (CCMT) in Mumbai, India, headed by Swami Swaroopananda. The motto of Chinmaya Mission is \\"to give maximum happiness to maximum people for maximum time.\\" It does not seek to convert other religious practitioners. History =Foundation= Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati, the founder of Chinmaya Mission, taught spirituality as the art of living. Through jnana yoga (the Vedantic path of spiritual knowledge), he emphasized the balance of head and heart, pointing out selfless work, study, and meditation as the cornerstones of spiritual practice. Doubting the teachings of the sages in the Himalayas, Balakrishna Menon met Swami Sivananda (Divine Life Society), who initially guided him in spiritual studies and then placed him under the tutelage of Swami Tapovanam (Tapovan Maharaj), with whom he pursued spiritual studies for nine years. He eventually came to share this Vedantic knowledge with the masses, in the form of the dynamic teacher known as Swami Chinmayananda. Swamiji is a teacher of Srimad Bhagavad Gita. He is often credited with the renaissance of spirituality and cultural values in India, and with the spreading of Advaita Vedanta, as expounded by Adi Shankaracharya, throughout the world. =After Chinmayananda= After Chinmayananda attained mahasamadhi in 1993, his disciple Swami Tejomayananda (known as Guruji) became the global head of Chinmaya Mission. Under Guruji, projects such as the Chinmaya International Foundation and the Chinmaya International Residential School were taken up. In January 2017, Swami Tejomayananda assigned the headship of Chinmaya Mission Worldwide to sri Swami Swaroopananda. Activities The following activities are conducted at mission centers on a weekly basis: = Bala Vihar = Bala Vihar is a program in which children from age five to eighteen meet on a weekly basis to learn about Hindu culture, customs, and philosophy. Bala Vihar is a program that is conducted throughout the world, not just in India, from countries such as the United States, UK, and Australia.

The society is devoted to the promotion and advancement of knowledge of the universe through research and education, and its membership is open to people with a professional involvement in astronomy and related sciences. The main activities of the Society are its annual scientific meetings, the planning and realization of scientific projects, the support of the scientific activities of its members, and the dissemination of related information among members and other interested people.  History  Before World War II, there were few professional astronomers in Canada. There were two government-run, national observatories, the Dominion Observatory, which opened in 1905 in Ottawa, Ontario and the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, which opened in 1918 in Saanich, British Columbia. In addition, the University of Toronto's David Dunlap Observatory, which opened in 1935 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, housed the only significant university faculty and the only centre for graduate studies in astronomy in Canada. During this period, the most prominent astronomical organization in Canada was the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, which counted both amateurs and professional astronomer as members. Canadians also held leadership positions and attended meetings of the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Beginning with Ottawa in 1911, several Canadian cities hosted AAS meetings. Canada was also an early member of the International Astronomical Union, with activities coordinated through the Dominion Observatory. In the 1960s, University programmes in science expanded rapidly and astronomy groups and departments appeared across Canada. This influx of astronomers, along with the closure of the Dominion Observatory in 1970, created demand for a professional society of Canadian astronomers. CASCA was founded in May 1971 by a committee of the Canadian government's National Research Council and Helen Sawyer Hogg was elected as the first president. CASCA was incorporated in 1983 as a society of professional astronomers.  Publications  The quarterly newsletter of the Society, called Cassiopeia is published at equinoxes and solstices.

Publication history Roulette was created by Chris Claremont and Sal Buscema in New Mutants #16-17 (June‚ÄìJuly 1984) for the antithesis to the New Mutants: the Hellions. The character subsequently appears in The Uncanny X-Men #193 (May 1985), Firestar #2-4 (April‚ÄìJune 1986), The New Mutants #39 (May 1986), #43 (September 1986), #53-54 (July‚ÄìAugust 1987), #56 (October 1987), #62 (April 1988), The New Warriors #9-10 (March‚ÄìApril 1991), and died in The Uncanny X-Men #281 (October 1991). The character made a posthumous appearance in The New Warriors Annual #2 (1992). Roulette appeared as part of the \\"Hellions\\" entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #5. Fictional character biography Jennifer Stavros was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey. As a teenager, Jennifer was recruited into the Hellions and enrolled at Emma's Frost's Massachusetts Academy where she was covertly trained in combat as one of the Hellions, the teenage enforcement squad of the HellFire Club. One of the team's first missions was to confront the New Mutants, who were attacking the Massachusetts Academy in an attempt to retrieve their kidnapped schoolmate, X-man Kitty Pryde. The Hellions met with mixed success against the New Mutants in their first conflict. Roulette was able to neutralize New Mutants Sunspot and Wolfsbane in this initial meeting by making Sunspot's back muscles go into spasm and a bookshelf to crash on to Wolfsbane.New Mutants, volume 1 #16-17 (June, July 1984) Roulette begins a guarded flirtation with one of her teammates, Empath, with whom she shares an enthusiasm for making others suffer.Uncanny X-Men #193 (May 1985) As such, both she and Empath, along with Firestar, a recent addition to the Massachusetts Academy, follow their teammate James Proudstar (using his then codename Thunderbird) as he confronts the X-Men over this brother John's death. During this conflict, Roulette is able to use her probability altering powers to cause the X-Men's cloaking mechanisms to malfunction, and also to generate an electrical feedback loop in the Blackbird's portable Cerebro unit.Uncanny X-Men #193 (May, 1985) At a party thrown by the Hellfire Club, Roulette turned her charms on New Mutant Cypher. She surreptitiously used her luck altering powers to cause Cypher to win several hands of poker. However, after getting drunk, Cypher hits her in a paranoid fit.New Mutants #53 Roulette is present when the New Mutants briefly join the Massachusetts Academy following the events of Secrets Wars.New Mutants, volume 1 #39 (May 1986) She is likewise present when the Hellions confront the New Mutants as both teams attempt to capture a runaway mutate creature known as Bird-Brain. During this mission, she is able to use her good luck discs to save herself and teammate Catseye from a high altitude fall, causing their landings to occur on a cushioned canopyNew Mutants, volume 1 #56 (October 1987) Roulette was part of the force of Hellions that attacked the New Warriors over the fate of Firestar, a former member. At first, her powers were deflected back on her teammates but when the battles degenerated to one on one, she easily took down Speedball. Eventually the Hellions left, having lost due to the competition deal between the White Queen and Tai, the unofficial force behind the Warriors.New Warriors #9-10 (March‚ÄìApril 1991) Soon after, at another Hell Fire Club engagement (attended by both the Hellions and the X-Men Gold Team) Roulette, along with most of her teammates is killed, either by Sentinels or by Trevor Fitzroy in order to fuel his time traveling teleportation portals.off-panel in Uncanny X-Men #282 (1991) =Necrosha= Roulette appears in the Necrosha event in New Mutants (vol. 3), along with the other deceased Hellions, having been resurrected by Selene's magic and the transmode virus.New Mutants volume 3 #7-8 (2010) She again appears infected with the transmode virus in the \\"Fight the Future\\" arc of New Mutants (vol. 3).New Mutants volume 3 #48-49 (2012) Her interest in Cypher was apparently more than just indulgence of her love of mischief; during the Necrosha storyline, when Roulette - resurrected by Selene - is temporarily possessed by Karma, interrupting Selene's psychic control, she reflects over Cypher's prone form that she used to 'think (she) loved' him.

It is common in astronomy for objects to be given names, in accordance with accepted astronomical naming conventions. Most stars have not been given proper names, relying instead on alphanumeric designations in star catalogues. However, a few hundred had either long-standing traditional names (usually from the Arabic) or historic names from frequent usage. In addition, many stars have catalogue designations that contain the name of their compiler or discoverer. This includes Wolf, Ross, Bradley, Piazzi, Lacaille, Struve, Groombridge, Lalande, Krueger, Mayer, Weisse, Gould, Luyten and others. For example, Wolf 359 was discovered and catalogued by Max Wolf. Various private organizations claim to name stars in honor of people in exchange for a fee, but these names are used only within their own publications, and are not recognized by the scientific community.  Names approved by the IAU  The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is widely recognized by scientists and governments as the world authority for names of astronomical bodies, and lays down strict standards for this naming. In July 2014 the IAU launched a process for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host stars, the outcome of which was announced in December 2015. As a result, the IAU approved two star names after individuals: *Cervantes for the star Mu Arae honoring the writer Miguel de Cervantes *Copernicus for the star 55 Cancri A honoring the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which will catalog cultural and historical names for bright stars to help preserve astronomical world heritage, and maintain a catalog of IAU-approved unique proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 set out its terms of reference and naming guidelines. All approved names are included on the current List of IAU-approved Star Names, last updated on 1 June 2018. The WGSN rules generally discouraged the naming of stars after people, but confirmed the names Cervantes and Copernicus as well as four others: *Barnard's Star, the fourth-closest star to the solar system, named after the American astronomer E. E. Barnard who discovered it has the highest known proper motion of any star. *Cor Caroli (Latin for 'heart of Charles') for the star Alpha Canum Venaticorum, so named in honour of King Charles I of England by Sir Charles Scarborough, his physician.R.H. Allen, Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning.Robert Burnham, Jr. Burnham's Celestial Handbook, Volume 1, p. 359.Ian Ridpath: \\"Star Tales\\", Canes Venatici. See also Deborah J. Warner, The Sky Explored: Celestial Cartography 1500-1800. *Sualocin and Rotanev for components of Alpha and Beta Delphini, two stars which appeared in the Palermo star catalogue of 1814. They were eventually identified as the reversed spelling of Nicolaus Venator, a Latinised version of Nicol√≤ Cacciatore, assistant to the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi. It is not clear whether Piazzi intended to name the stars after his assistant, or if Cacciatore made the names up himself. In 2019, IAU held the NameExoWorlds campaign. Spain named the star HD 149143 as Rosal√≠adecastro after the writer Rosal√≠a de Castro.  Names not approved by the IAU  Apart from the few formally approved by the IAU, and leaving aside commercial attempts, stars named after individuals fall broadly into two groups. The first group are those named openly for an individual connected with them in some way. The second, somewhat more obscurely, are those named after an individual but without explicitly making this clear. =Openly named stars= There is a growing number of stars whose common names honour individuals. Many of these were highly significant in some way when discovered, usually through having some unusual characteristic. The best source to get these names is Sky Catalogue 2000.0, Volume 2 (Double Stars, Variable Stars, and Nonstellar Objects), in the chapter Glossary Of Selected Astronomical Names. *Abt's Star is ADS 8115 (HD 98088) in Crater.

(Note that Pandora's Star and Ratner's Star are the names of novels, not actual stars.) =Covertly named stars= Some stars were given names that were disguised names of individuals, which names subsequently appeared in star catalogues and thus into more general usage. The earliest noted example was Sualocin and Rotanev, which names have now been approved by the IAU WGSN (see above). More recently, during the Apollo program, it was common for astronauts to be trained in celestial navigation, and to use a list of naked-eye stars which to take bearings. As a practical joke, Gus Grissom gave names to three stars on this list, which were references to the three Apollo 1 crew: *Navi for the star Gamma Cassiopeiae and which is Ivan spelled backwards, the middle name of Virgil Ivan \\"Gus\\" Grissom. *Dnoces for the star Iota Ursae Majoris and which is Second spelled backwards, alluding to Edward Higgins White, II. *Regor for the star Gamma Velorum and which is Roger spelled backwards, the first name of Roger Bruce Chaffee. The names stuck, perhaps in memoriam for their deaths in the Apollo 1 fire, and were used through the rest of the program. Unknown to Grissom, these stars already had traditional names; however, those were not generally used, allowing the three new names to make their way into other records. Today, they are generally considered disused‚Äîsome sources listing them as \\"traditional\\". It is possible, though unlikely, that further traditional names are in fact hidden names such as these, not yet identified; etymologies for many star names are not currently known. = Commercial naming = Whilst many private companies will offer the \\"right\\" to name a star, for a fee, they have no legal standing to assign any star a name, and can offer no guarantee of the name being noted outside of their own publications. The IAU does not recognize this practice, and on its website describes it as \\"charlatanry\\".

It belonged to a family of extinct lemurs known as \\"sloth lemurs\\" (Palaeopropithecidae), and because of its extremely large size, it has been compared to the ground sloths that once roamed North and South America. It was most closely related to Palaeopropithecus, the second largest type of sloth lemur. Along with the other sloth lemurs, Archaeoindris was related to the living indri, sifakas, and woolly lemurs, as well as the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae). The genus, Archaeoindris, translates to \\"ancient indri-like lemur\\", even though it probably became extinct recently, around 350 BC. Archaeoindris was first described by Herbert F. Standing in 1909 based on subfossil fragmentary jaws, although Charles Lamberton later discovered a complete skull. Only six bones from the lower skeleton have been found, and excavations in the 1980s offered no leads for new finds. Its remains have been found at only one location: Ampasambazimba, a subfossil site in central Madagascar. Following its initial discovery, some subfossil remains of Megaladapis grandidieri (a type of extinct koala lemur) were mistakenly associated with Archaeoindris, while smaller leg bones from a juvenile and a massive adult leg bone were erroneously assumed to belong to two separate species. These errors were gradually corrected between the 1930s and 1980s. The skeleton of Archaeoindris was massive and robust, and shared many traits with that of Palaeopropithecus. The arms were longer than the legs, but no hand or foot bones have been found for comparison with the other sloth lemurs. Size estimates based on the limited remains have varied widely, ranging as high as , but the most thorough statistical investigation using regression analyses predicts a mass of . Misattributions and limited remains have resulted in varying opinions about the way Archaeoindris moved in its environment, ranging from tree-dwelling to ground-dwelling. Its skeleton suggests it was a deliberate climber that visited the ground to travel. The diet of Archaeoindris was mostly leaves, and its habitat‚Äîprior to human arrival‚Äîwas a mix of woodlands, bushlands, and savanna, rich in lemur diversity. Today, the region is dominated by grasslands and lemur diversity is very low in the nearest protected area, Ambohitantely Special Reserve. Although it was a rare lemur, it was still extant when humans first arrived on Madagascar, and it would have been vulnerable to hunting and habitat loss. Etymology The generic name Archaeoindris, meaning \\"ancient indri-like lemur\\", is derived from the Greek word ·ºÄœÅœáŒ±·øñŒøœÇ (archaios, or \\"ancient\\") and indris, a common variation of the generic name Indri. The species name, fontoynontii (sometimes spelled fontoynonti), was selected in honor of Antoine Maurice Fontoynont, the president of the Acad√©mie Malgache (Malagasy Academy) at the time. Fontoynont was reported to have been supervising the excavation when it was discovered. Evolutionary history Archaeoindris was a type of sloth lemur (family Palaeopropithecidae), a recently extinct family of giant lemurs (known as subfossil lemurs) native to Madagascar. Its ancestors were likely arboreal (tree-dwelling), and this giant sloth lemur has been compared to the extinct giant ground sloths of North and South America. Archaeoindris was most closely related to Palaeopropithecus, a genus containing the second largest of the sloth lemurs and specialized for suspensory behavior in its arboreal habitat. Traits of the postcranium (skeleton below the skull) indicate that Babakotia was the next most closely related sloth lemur to Archaeoindris and Palaeopropithecus, followed by Mesopropithecus, the smallest of the sloth lemurs. All four genera of sloth lemurs are known to be a sister taxon (close relatives) of family Indriidae, which includes the indri (Indri), sifakas (Propithecus), and woolly lemurs (Avahi). This relationship is supported by data from morphological, developmental, and molecular research. Another member of this clade (related group) is the family of monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae). Dental features, such as the morphology of their molar teeth and the modified number of teeth in their toothcomb (a specialized grooming structure found in lemuriforms), have long suggested a relationship. However, other anatomical and developmental traits suggested that monkey lemurs might be more closely related to family Lemuridae, which include five genera of lemur, including the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). Molecular analysis has shown strong support for the former, placing the monkey lemurs in a clade with the sloth lemurs and indriids. =Taxonomic classification= The family Palaeopropithecidae contained a large number of species compared to most other subfossil lemur families. It included four genera and seven species, all of which are now extinct. Among these was the genus Archaeoindris, one of only a few monotypic lemur taxa. Archaeoindris fontoynontii was first described by Herbert F. Standing in 1909 from two fragments of a maxilla (upper jaw) and a complete mandible (lower jaw). These type specimens‚ÄîAM-6239 (maxillae) and AM-6237 (mandible)‚Äîare stored in the collection at the University of Antananarivo. The mandible contains a complete set of upper teeth, the left maxillary fragment contains the last premolar (P4) and all three molars (M1‚ÄìM3), and the right maxillary fragment bears both premolars (P2 and P4) and the first molar (M1). At the time, Standing noted similarities with the dentition of Palaeopropithecus. Sixteen years after Standing's discovery, Charles Lamberton discovered the first and only complete cranium (skull) and associated mandible for Archaeoindris, both of which were well preserved. He published this find in 1934. Only six postcranial specimens of Archaeoindris have been found. Two of these belonged to an adult and include a damaged humerus (upper arm bone) and an almost complete femur (thigh bone). The other four come from an immature individual and include a damaged humerus, a damaged ulna (lower arm bone), and two femurs, both lacking the epiphyses (rounded end of the bone) on both ends. Archaeoindris is one of the least common of the subfossil lemurs, and the few known specimens were all found at Ampasambazimba in the Central Highlands. Excavations run by a multi- disciplinary Malagasy-American team at this fossil site between 1983 and 1984 yielded no new subfossil remains, and no other potential sites are known for this species. Historically, some remains from other subfossil lemurs have been mistakenly attributed to Archaeoindris, resulting in incorrect interpretations of its anatomy and behavior. In 1934, Lamberton missed earlier attribution errors and incorrectly labeled a tibia and two fibulae (lower leg bones) from a species of koala lemur (Megaladapis grandidieri) as belonging to Archaeoindris. Because of these misattributions and Lamberton's use of the immature bones, his reconstruction was inaccurate. In 1936, Alice Carleton corrected Lamberton by identifying the tibia and fibulae as belonging to a koala lemur. Carleton's corrections were later confirmed and other misattributions were corrected in the 1960s and 1970s by Alan Walker and William L. Jungers. In 1910, twenty-four years before Lamberton's monograph on Archaeoindris, Standing identified a massive right femur from Ampasambazimba as a new species, Lemuridotherium madagascariense. Although Standing recognized the strong similarities between Lemuridotherium and Archaeoindris, he placed them in separate genera due to what he perceived as a great size difference. Lamberton was also persuaded by the size difference, partly because he failed to recognize the smaller tibia and fibulae as belonging to the smaller Megaladapis grandidieri. Furthermore, Lamberton did not realize that the smaller femurs he assigned to Archaeoindris belonged to a juvenile. Although some later authors considered Lemuridotherium a synonym of Archaeoindris, it was not until 1988 that Martine Vuillaume-Randriamanantena provided a definitive proof. Vuillaume-Randriamanantena also established associations between the postcrania and crania of Archareoindris, summarized what is known about the postcranial skeleton, and documented the strong similarity with the genus Palaeopropithecus. Anatomy and physiology The skull of Archaeoindris was wide and short, with a pair of bony protrusions around the nasal openings. Though similar to Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris was significantly larger and more robust. Archaeoindris was one of the largest primates to ever evolve, and was the largest-known strepsirrhine primate, weighing an estimated . It was roughly the size of an adult male gorilla, which was first noted by Lamberton. Since its discovery, size estimates have varied from \\"larger than a human\\" to \\"possibly the largest primate ever\\". In a study by Jungers from 1990, the area of its molar teeth predicted a mass of , while the femoral head diameter predicted a mass of . In 1995, Laurie Godfrey estimated a mass of using the midshaft circumferences of the humerus and femur. Based on multiple regressions of the cortical area of the femur in 2008, Jungers and colleagues generated the current best estimate of with a possible range of . These estimates were considered to be more accurate since the harder cortical bone in the midshaft of the femur supported an animal's weight, and its thickness better correlated with the animal's mass than the midshaft diameter (which includes both hard cortex and spongy bone). The only fossil primate that was probably larger than Archaeoindris was Gigantopithecus blacki, a close relative of orangutans. Like all three species of Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris exhibited derived traits not seen in the two other less specialized genera of sloth lemur. These traits included deflated auditory bullae and paired protrusions of bone around the nasal opening consisting of part of the premaxilla and the nasal bones. Its skull was wider than that of Megaladapis, but shorter, measuring . Its face was shorter than that of Palaeopropithecus, with its eyes directed further forward. The neurocranium (braincase) was small and elevated relative to the face, unlike Palaeopropithecus. Postorbital constriction (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets) is pronounced. The skull also bore a low, broad sagittal crest (a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and robust but smaller nuchal crests (ridges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles attach). Unlike Palaeopropithecus the rims of the orbits (eye sockets) were not as thick. The area of the orbit was , comparable to that of gorillas. Based on the ratio of its orbit area to the size of its optic canal, Archaeoindris had low retinal summation, meaning its eyes were less sensitive to light (like living diurnal lemurs). Yet the ratio was not as low as in comparably sized apes, suggesting Archaeoindris had low visual acuity and lacked trichromatic color vision. Mandible and fragmentary maxillae of A. fontoynontii (1909) The jaw exhibited a long, robust mandibular symphysis (joining of the two halves of the lower jaw), which fused early during development. Its palate (bones on the roof of the mouth) was rectangular. Like other sloth lemurs, it likely experienced accelerated dental development, and had an adult dental formula of . Its teeth were also similar to those of Palaeopropithecus, both in morphology and proportions. The four lower incisors that would have made up the toothcomb were modified, being shorter and more robust, possibly for feeding purposes. The canines were short and stout, but sharp. Also, there was a diastema (gap) between the lower premolars (p2 and p4). Other dental similarities with Palaeopropithecus included small third upper and lower molars (M3 and m3), the first and second molars were narrow and long, and the enamel of its cheek teeth was crenulated (low and rounded), though not as wrinkled and slightly higher-crowned. Most bones of the postcranial skeleton, including the bones of the hands, feet, vertebral column, ribs, radius (lower arm bone), tibia, and fibula, have not been found for Archaeoindris. As with many cranial features, the postcranial bones that have been discovered are similar to that of Palaeopropithecus, but significantly larger and more robust. The head of the femur was large and lacked a fovea capitis femoris (a small depression in the head of the femur). The femur was short and extremely robust, had a very high collodiaphyseal angle (the angle of the neck and shaft of the bone), and the greater trochanter was small. In the adult, the humerus was significantly longer than the femur, while in the immature specimen, both the humerus and ulna were much longer than the femur, making the arms considerably longer than the legs, as also seen in Palaeopropithecus. The relative length of the arms to the legs was shorter in Archaeoindris, so although its intermembral index was over 100, it was lower than that of Palaeopropithecus. Behavior Archaeoindris is thought to have been a leaf-eater (folivorous), a view supported by wear patterns on its teeth. Its fused mandibular symphyses and the likelihood of accelerated dental development suggest that it began processing fibrous foods in the mouth with thorough chewing. Its diet may also have included some fruits and seeds. Like most of the other giant lemurs, Archaeoindris is thought to have been diurnal because of its relatively small orbits, which are comparable to those of gorillas. Both Standing and Lamberton assumed Archaeoindris to be a slow-moving tree-dweller like Megaladapis, primarily due to the misattributed bones. Lamberton also speculated that it would have resembled a ground sloth‚Äîa view later supported by Jungers in 1980 after several misattributions had been corrected and having considered its gorilla- like size. Jungers went on to propose that it would have spent most of its time on the ground (terrestrial). However, the functional morphology of its hip joint indicates a degree of mobility typically seen in more arboreal animals. Other traits shared with Palaeopropithecus, particularly seen in the femur, suggest that Archaeoindris spent considerable time in the trees for feeding and possibly nesting, although it also would have visited the ground to feed and travel. It is described as a deliberate, scansorial (climbing) browser, and it is unknown whether it was like Palaeopropithecus in performing hang-feeding since hand and foot bones are missing. Given its bulky size, this would be unexpected. Distribution and habitat Archaeoindris is known from only one subfossil site, Ampasambazimba, in central Madagascar, and all remains date to the Late Quaternary. The area today is dominated by grasslands, particularly of the grass genus Aristida. Prior to human arrival, the area around Ampasambazimba was not completely forested, but more of an open habitat, consisting of a mix of woodlands, bushlands, and savanna. Animal remains at this subfossil site have yielded about 20 species of lemur living in sympatry (sharing the same geographic area). In comparison, the nearby Ambohitantely Special Reserve today contains only four species, roughly 20% of the area's original lemur diversity. Extinction Despite being the most species-rich family among the giant lemurs, all four genera of sloth lemur, including Archaeoindris, have gone extinct. Radiocarbon dating of the stratigraphic level of some of the Archaeoindris remains were dated to 8000 BP, while two other specimens were dated to 2362‚Äì2149 BP (412‚Äì199 BCE) and 2711‚Äì2338 BP (761‚Äì388 BCE). From these dates, it is likely that Archaeoindris was still alive on the high plateau in 350 BCE when the first humans reached the west coast of Madagascar, despite being rare by that time. Consequently, it would have been especially vulnerable to hunting and habitat loss.

The origins of the interlocking-sinusoid design can be traced to as early as the Goguryeo or Silla period, e.g. in the decoration of a sword, dated to the 5th or 6th century, recovered from the grave of Michu of Silla,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Cultivation and Utilization of Asian, Sub-tropical, and Underutilized Horticultural Crops: Seoul, Korea, August 13‚Äì19, 2006 (2011), p. 48 or an artifact with the a Taegeuk pattern of similar age found in the Bogam-ri tombs of Baekje at Naju, South Jeolla Province in 2008.Íµ≠ÎÇ¥ ÊúÄÂè§ ÌÉúÍ∑πÎ¨¥Îä¨, 1400ÎÖÑ ÎßåÏóê ÌñáÎπõ Dong-A Science, Yoon wan-jun, 2009-06-04 In the compound of Gameunsa, a temple built in AD 628 during the reign of King Jinpyeong of Silla, a stone object, perhaps the foundation of a pagoda, is carved with the Taegeuk design.Í≤ΩÏ£ºÍ∞êÏùÄÏÇ¨ÏßÄ Encyclopedia of Korea In Gojoseon, that is the ancient kingdom of Joseon, the design was used to express the hope for harmony of yin and yang.An Illustrated Guide to Korean Culture - 233 traditional key words by The National Academy of the Korean Language Today the Taegeuk is commonly associated with Korean tradition and represents balance in the universe: the red half represents positive cosmic forces, and the blue half represents the opposing negative cosmic forces. It is used in Korean shamanism South Korean flag South Korean national flag, also known as the Taegeukgi (), has a blue and red taegeuk in the center. The Taegeuk symbol is most prominently displayed on South Korea's national flag, called the taegeukgi (along with four of the eight trigrams used in divination). Because of the Taegeuk's association with the national flag, it is often used as a patriotic symbol, as are the colors red, blue, and black. The ‚Äúgeon‚Äù trigram (‚ò∞) represents the heaven, spring, east, and justice. The ‚Äúgon‚Äù trigram (‚ò∑) symbolizes the earth, summer, west, and vitality, the ‚Äúgam‚Äù trigram (‚òµ) the moon, winter, north, and wisdom, and the ‚Äúri‚Äù trigram (‚ò≤) the sun, autumn, south, and fruition. The four trigrams supposedly move in an endless cycle from ‚Äúgeon‚Äù to ‚Äúri‚Äù to ‚Äúgon‚Äù to ‚Äúgam‚Äù and back to ‚Äúgeon‚Äù in their pursuit of perfection. The white background symbolizes the homogeneity, integrity and peace-loving nature of the Korean people. Traditionally, Koreans often wore white clothing, earning the nickname ‚Äúwhite- clothed people‚Äù and therefore the color white epitomizes the Korean people. Variants =Tricolored Taegeuk= Hand fan with a three-color Taegeuk design A popular variant in South Korea is the tricolor Taegeuk (samsaeguitaegeuk or samtaegeuk ), which adds a yellow lobe or \\"pa\\" ( ). The yellow is taken as representing humanity, in addition to the red and blue representing earth and heaven respectively. This version is related to the Tibetan & Korean Buddhist symbol of Gankyil. A rendition of the tricolored Taegeuk also appeared in the official logo of the 1988 Summer Olympics accompanied by the five Olympic rings.http://www.aldaver.com/Images/Os/lg1988sm.gif A similar symbol is used by the Miss Asia Pacific World Beauty Pageant, which was hosted in South Korea from its inception in 2011 until 2014, and most recently hosted in Australia in 2018. =Paralympics symbol= First Paralympic symbol (1988‚Äì1994) used five pa. The first designated Paralympic logo, created for the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, was based on the traditional pa ( ), the spiral or sinusoid components making up the Taegeuk symbol. In March 1992,Vom Rehabilitationssport zu den Paralympics (German), Sportmuseum Leipzig the Paralympic symbol was changed to a version utilizing only three pa. This was not fully adopted until after the 1994 Winter Paralympics in Lillehammer, Norway, since the Lillehammer Paralympic Organizing Committee had by then already started a marketing program based on the five-pa version. The three-pa version remained in place from the close of the Lillehammer Games through the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece.International Paralympic Committee - The IPC logo, motto and flag, CRWFlags.com Gallery File:Taegeuk in Naju Hyanggyo.jpgTaegeuk pattern painted on the gate of a house in Naju Image:Sam Taeguk.jpgThree-color Taegeuk on a buk (drum) Image:Samtaegeuk with Fu Hsi's 8 trigrams.svgThree-color Taegeuk encircled by pal gwae.

Ahmad al-Mansur was an important figure in both Europe and Africa in the sixteenth century; his powerful army and strategic location made him an important power player in the late Renaissance period. He has been described as \\"a man of profound Islamic learning, a lover of books, calligraphy and mathematics, as well as a connoisseur of mystical texts and a lover of scholarly discussions.\\" Early life Ahmad was the fifth son of Mohammed ash-Sheikh who was the first Saadi sultan of Morocco. His mother was the well-known Lalla Masuda. After the murder of their father, Mohammed in 1557 and the following struggle for power, the two brothers Ahmad al-Mansur and Abd al-Malik had to flee their elder brother Abdallah al-Ghalib (1557‚Äì1574), leave Morocco and stay abroad until 1576. The two brothers spent 17 years among the Ottomans between the Regency of Algiers and Constantinople, and benefited from Ottoman training and contacts with Ottoman culture. More generally, he \\"received an extensive education in Islamic religious and secular sciences, including theology, law, poetry, grammar, lexicography, exegesis, geometry, arithmetics and algebra, and astronomy.\\" Battle of Ksar el Kebir In 1578, Ahmad's brother, Sultan Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi, died in battle against the Portuguese army at Ksar-el-Kebir. Ahmad was named his brother's successor and began his reign amid newly won prestige and wealth from the ransom of Portuguese captives. Rule (1578‚Äì1603) In 1600 Ahmad al-Mansur sent his Secretary Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud (pictured) as ambassador of Morocco to the Court of Queen Elizabeth I of England to negotiate an alliance against Spain. Marrakech and El Badi Palace, by Adriaen Matham, 1640 Al-Mansur began his reign by leveraging his dominant position with the vanquished Portuguese during prisoner ransom talks, the collection of which filled the Moroccan royal coffers. Shortly after, he began construction on the great architectural symbol of this new birth of Moroccan power and relevance; the grand palace in Marrakesh called El Badi, or \\"the marvelous\\" (El Badi Palace). Eventually the coffers began to run dry due to the great expense of supporting the military, extensive spy services, the palace and other urban building projects, a royal lifestyle and a propaganda campaign aimed at building support for his controversial claim to the Caliphate. =Relations with Europe= Morocco's standing with the Christian states was still in flux. The Spaniards and the Portuguese were still popularly seen as the infidel, but al-Mansur knew that the only way his Sultanate would thrive was to continue to benefit from alliances with the Christian economies. To do that Morocco had to control sizable gold resources of its own. Accordingly, al-Mansur was drawn irresistibly to the trans-Saharan gold trade of the Songhai in hopes of solving Morocco's economic deficit with Europe. Ahmad al-Mansur developed friendly relations with England in view of an Anglo-Moroccan alliance. In 1600 he sent his Secretary Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud as ambassador to the Court of Queen Elizabeth I of England to negotiate an alliance against Spain. Ahmad al- Mansur also wrote about reconquering Al-Andalus for Islam back from the Christian Spanish. In a letter of 1 May 1601 he wrote that he also had ambitions to colonize the New World with Moroccans. He envisioned that Islam would prevail in the Americas and the Mahdi would be proclaimed from the two sides of the oceans. Ahmad al-Mansur had French physicians at his Court. Arnoult de Lisle was physician to the Sultan from 1588 to 1598. He was then succeeded by √âtienne Hubert d'Orl√©ans from 1598 to 1600. Both in turn returned to France to become professors of Arabic at the Coll√®ge de France, and continued with diplomatic endeavours. =Songhai campaign= West Africa after the Moroccan invasion The Songhai Empire was a western African state centered in eastern Mali. From the early 15th to the late 16th century, it was one of the largest African empires in history. On October 16, 1590, Ahmad took advantage of recent civil strife in the empire and dispatched an army of 4,000 men across the Sahara desert under the command of converted Spaniard Judar Pasha.. Though the Songhai met them at the Battle of Tondibi with a force of 40,000, they lacked the Moroccan's gunpowder weapons and quickly fled. Ahmad advanced, sacking the Songhai cities of Timbuktu and Djenn√©, as well as the capital Gao. Despite these initial successes, the logistics of controlling a territory across the Sahara soon grew too difficult, and the Saadians lost control of the cities not long after 1620. El Badi Palace, Marrakech. Built by Al-Mansur in 1578. Legacy Ahmad al-Mansur died of the plague in 1603 and was succeeded by Zidan Abu Maali, who was based in Marrakech, and by Abou Fares Abdallah, who was based in Fes who had only local power. He was buried in the mausoleum of the Saadian Tombs in Marrakech. Well-known writers at his court were Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, Abd al-Aziz al-Fishtali, Ahmad Ibn al- Qadi and Al-Masfiwi. Through astute diplomacy al-Mansur resisted the demands of the Ottoman sultan, to preserve Moroccan independence. By playing the Europeans and Ottomans against one another al-Mansur excelled in the art of balance of power diplomacy. Eventually he spent far more than he collected. He attempted to expand his holdings through conquest, and although initially successful in their military campaign against the Songhay Empire, the Moroccans found it increasingly difficult to maintain control over the conquered locals as time went on. Meanwhile, as the Moroccans continued to struggle in the Songhay, their power and prestige on the world stage declined significantly. Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur was one of the first authorities to take action on smoking in 1602, towards the end of his reign. The ruler of the Saadi dynasty used the religious tool of fatwas (Islamic legal pronouncements) to discourage the use of tobacco.

Bush's foreign policy advisory team assembled to brief him prior to the 2000 US presidential election. The Vulcans were led by Condoleezza Rice and included Richard Armitage, Robert Blackwill, Stephen Hadley, Richard Perle, Dov S. Zakheim, Robert Zoellick and Paul Wolfowitz, and Wolfowitz prot√©g√©, Scooter Libby. Other key campaign figures including Dick Cheney, George P. Shultz and Colin Powell were also closely associated with the group, but were never actually members. During the campaign, Bush sought to deflect questions about his own lack of foreign policy experience by pointing to this group of experienced advisers. After the election, all the members of the team received key positions within the new Bush administration. The name \\"The Vulcans\\" alludes to a huge statue of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and metalworking, in Rice's home town of Birmingham, Alabama. It may also allude to fictional, humanlike, alien beings who suppress their emotions in favor of cold rational logic in Star Trek. The most famous of those Vulcans is Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy. Origin Condoleezza Rice: Vulcan and former National Security Advisor (2001‚Äì2005) and US Secretary of State (2005‚Äì2009) During the summer of 1998, George W. Bush met with Condoleezza Rice at the behest of George H. W. Bush at the Bush estate in Kennebunkport, Maine. Rice had been director for Soviet and East European Affairs of the National Security Council under Brent Scowcroft during George H. W. Bush's administration and Scowcroft had been guiding her career ever since, ensuring she came to the attention of Bush Sr. \\"Eventually he was quite taken with her\\", Scowcroft recalled in an interview by James Mann for his book Rise of the Vulcans (2004). According to Coit D. Blacker, Rice and George W. Bush also \\"bonded at Kennebunkport\\" in August 1998.Mann, James. 2004. Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet. p. 250. The several days of discussions that followed resulted in Rice agreeing to take charge of foreign policy for George W. Bush's upcoming presidential campaign. Later that year, Paul Wolfowitz, a former prot√©g√© of George Shultz and Dick Cheney, was taken on as well. Wolfowitz had also served as foreign policy advisor to Bob Dole during the 1996 US presidential election. In early 1999, a team largely drawn from the middle echelons of the first Bush administration began to act as foreign policy advisors to George W. Bush:Mann, James. 2004.

Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet. p. 252. During 1999 and 2000, a second group was formed under the leadership of Donald Rumsfeld to deal specifically with the subject of missile defense. While distinct from the Vulcans, it did include Rice, Wolfowitz, Hadley and Perle alongside Shultz and various academics and scientists, including Martin Anderson of Stanford University and Lowell Wood of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Mann, James. 2004. Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet. p. 253. Campaign George W. Bush laid out his foreign policy plans on October 11, 2000, at the second Gore-Bush presidential debate against his Democratic rival Vice President Al Gore.Second Presidential Debate, October 11, 2000: transcript. > If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation, > but strong, they'll welcome us. Our nation stands alone right now in the > world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble, and yet > project strength in a way that promotes freedom. \\"The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops\\", Bush announced. \\"He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using troops as nation builders\\", he clarified, expressing particular concerns about the Clinton Administration's recent involvement in Somalia and Haiti, by telling Gore: > I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and > say this is the way it's got to be. We can help. And maybe it's just our > difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the > people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell > people what to do. I just don't think it's the role of the United States to > walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. \\"I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war\\", Bush went on to explain, \\"I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times. I don't want to be the world's policeman.\\" During the campaign, Bush promised to increase the defense budget, stating that \\"America's armed forces need better equipment, better training and better pay.\\" However, Bush did not promise as much of an increase as Gore, even going as far as to state \\"If this is a race to see who can spend the most money, I'm going to lose.\\" Analyst William D. Hartung of the World Policy Institute points out that Gore promised $100 billion over 10 years while Bush promised $50 billion over the same period. However, according to Hartung, \\"the $50 billion referred to specific projects\\", and \\"[i]t could not possibly have referred to their entire proposed increase\\". Bush, at the advice of Hadley, also proposed greater nuclear arms reductions than Gore. Hadley's plan proposed unilaterally reducing the number of proposed long-range nuclear missiles to around 1,500‚Äì2,000 from the then 6,500‚Äì7,500, but caveats to this included the abandonment of attempts to get the Senate to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the development of new low-yield bunker-busting mini-nukes for actual battle-field use. Hartung feared that these steps would \\"re-start the nuclear arms race\\" as the US arsenal was upgraded. At the advice of Rumsfeld's missile defense group, Bush committed himself to building a strong National Missile Defense (NMD). Stating that \\"[n]ow is not the time to defend outdated treaties but to defend the American people\\", he made it clear that he was willing to abandon the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to do this. A member of the group had told The Washington Post that \\"All of us to a greater or lesser extent were uncomfortable with the treaty, but Bush said 'My concern isn't the treaty. My concern is missile defense, and I don't want anything to stand in the way of it. Bush's plans for NMD went far beyond the limited options endorsed by the Clinton Administration. As Hartung points out, \\"Bush's advisers suggested that if elected, would not limit the system to land-based options, but would move full speed ahead to develop interceptors based at sea, lasers based on aircraft and perhaps lasers or rockets based in space as well.\\" Hartung estimated that this would cost a minimum of $100‚Äì200 billion, far in excess of Bush's promised defense budget increase. Legacy Paul Wolfowitz: Vulcan and Bush's Deputy Secretary of Defense Following the election of George W. Bush as President of the United States, the Vulcans all received key positions within the new administration. *Richard Armitage was appointed US Deputy Secretary of State under Colin Powell. *Robert Blackwill was appointed US Ambassador to India and later to the US National Security Council. *Stephen Hadley was appointed US Deputy National Security Advisor under Rice and later US National Security Advisor. *Scooter Libby became Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States. *Richard Perle was appointed chairman of the US Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee. *Condoleezza Rice was appointed US National Security Advisor and later US Secretary of State in Bush's Second Administration. *Paul Wolfowitz was appointed US Deputy Secretary of Defense under Donald Rumsfeld and later president of the World Bank in 2005. *Dov Zakheim was appointed Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). *Robert Zoellick was appointed US Trade Representative, US Deputy Secretary of State and nominated as World Bank president in 2007. On December 13, 2001, in accordance with his campaign promises on National Missile Defense, Bush gave Russia six months notice of the United States' withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This was the first time in recent history the United States had withdrawn from a major international arms treaty. However, the humble foreign policy outlined by Bush during his campaign was quickly dropped after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in favor of a more aggressive policy that has been dubbed the Bush Doctrine.

Early life Butler was born in McComb, Mississippi and attended McComb High School and originally committed to play at Mississippi State University but failed to qualify academically. He later enrolled at Laurinburg Institute, then transferred to Coastal Christian Academy prep school in Virginia Beach. Although he wanted to sign with the University of Tennessee in 2004, he decided to declare for the 2004 NBA draft, the first player that year to do so. Professional career Butler went undrafted in the 2004 NBA draft and signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was then cut training camp. Butler began the 2004‚Äì05 season with the Continental Basketball Association where over 40 games with the Great Lakes Storm he averaged 18.1 points , 10.7 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game. On February 27, 2005, Butler signed with the New York Knicks for the rest of the 2004‚Äì05 NBA season, scoring ten points over three games. He later was drafted in the 2005 AAPBL draft. However, the league folded soon thereafter. When Larry Brown was hired as the New York Knicks' head coach, it was unclear what sort of role Butler would have. After the preseason, Brown publicly commented on how happy he was with Butler, and considered him his fourth rookie (after Channing Frye, Nate Robinson, and David Lee). After a rocky start, Butler was soon praised as being the Knicks' best center, with Eddy Curry and Jerome James having disappointing starts to their Knicks careers. For the 2005‚Äì06 NBA season Butler played in 55 games averaging 13.5 minutes, 5.3 points (54.4% field goal accuracy) and 3.3 rebounds per game. He earned US$641,748 with the Knicks. In July 2006, Butler signed a three-year, US$7 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He was considered a long-term project. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said on October 26, 2006, \\"most of his playing time in the initial part of the season is going to be in practice, learning what a work ethic is day in and day out and what it takes to play at this level.\\" Butler never played with the Spurs during the 2007 NBA Playoffs, but the Spurs won the 2007 NBA Finals. On July 12, 2007, the Spurs traded Butler and the rights to Luis Scola to the Houston Rockets for Vasileios Spanoulis, a 2009 second- round draft pick and cash. He played on the Rockets' 2007 summer league team, but was waived in the 2007‚Äì08 NBA preseason (October 2007).

Life Paten√¥tre was born in Baye (Marne). Educated at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, he taught for some years in the Algiers lyc√©e before he joined the diplomatic service in 1871. He took service from 1873 to 1876 in the North of Persia. In 1880, he was minister plenipotentiary in Stockholm, Sweden. In September 1883 he was named French minister to China and could conduct his most important mission in 1884, when he was sent as to regularize the French dominion in the Vietnamese protectorate state of Annam. The Harmand Treaty of 25 August 1883 had not been ratified by the French parliament and had upset the Chinese government. Paten√¥tre left Marseille at the end of April 1884 with a modified version of the treaty drafted by the Quai d'Orsay for signature by the king of Annam.Billot 1886 p.165-166, 172. At the end of May, he moved to a military vessel near Cap Saint-Jacques, learnt about the end of the Sino-French war and the Tientsin Accord of 11 May and received additional instructions from Paris. He arrived in H·∫£i Ph√≤ng on 26 May and in Hu·∫ø on 30 May,Devillers (1998) p.271. and started discussions with Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T∆∞·ªùng, the Regent.After the brief reign of Hi·ªáp Ho√† (30 July 1883 - 18 November 1883), the new emperor Ki·∫øn Ph√∫c was only 15 years old.

He then proceeded to Shanghai where he arrived on 1 JulyMcAleavy 1968, p. 244; Billot 1886 p.194. to settle with China the difficulties which had arisen over the evacuation of the Chinese troops from Tongking. The negotiation failed, and the French admiral S√©bastien Lesp√®s resumed hostilities against China in August 1884. The next year Paten√¥tre signed with Li Hongzhang a treaty of peace at Tientsin, by which the French protectorate in Annam and Tongking was recognized, and both parties agreed to remain within their own borders in the future. After serving as minister plenipotentiary in Morocco (1888‚Äì1891), Paten√¥tre was sent to Washington, D.C., where he was raised to the rank of ambassador in 1893.

Abu-Mostafa, M.Magdon-Ismail, and H.-T. Lin (2012) Learning from Data, AMLBook Press. ) is a measure of how accurately an algorithm is able to predict outcome values for previously unseen data. Because learning algorithms are evaluated on finite samples, the evaluation of a learning algorithm may be sensitive to sampling error. As a result, measurements of prediction error on the current data may not provide much information about predictive ability on new data. Generalization error can be minimized by avoiding overfitting in the learning algorithm. The performance of a machine learning algorithm is measured by plots of the generalization error values through the learning process, which are called learning curves.  Definition  In a learning problem, the goal is to develop a function f(x) that predicts output values y based on some input data x. The generalization error or expected error, I[f_n] of a particular function f_n over all possible values of x and y is:Mohri, M., Rostamizadeh A., Talwakar A., (2018) Foundations of Machine learning, 2nd ed., Boston: MIT Press : I[f_n] = \\\\int_{X \\\\times Y} V(f_n(x),y) \\\\rho(x,y) dx dy, where V denotes a loss function and \\\\rho(x,y) is the unknown joint probability distribution for x and y. Without knowing the joint probability distribution, it is impossible to compute I[f]. Instead, we can compute the empirical error on sample data. Given n data points, the empirical error is: : I_S[f_n] = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n V(f_n(x_i),y_i) An algorithm is said to generalize if: : \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} I[f_n] - I_S[f_n] = 0 The generalization error I[f_n] cannot be computed for an unknown probability distribution. Instead, the aim of many problems in statistical learning theory is to bound or characterize the difference of the generalization error and the empirical error in probability: : P_G = P(I[f_n] - I_S[f_n] \\\\leq \\\\epsilon) \\\\geq 1 - \\\\delta_n That is, the goal is to characterize the probability 1 - \\\\delta_n that the generalization error is less than the empirical error plus some error bound \\\\epsilon (generally dependent on \\\\delta and n). For many types of algorithms, it has been shown that an algorithm has generalization bounds if it meets certain stability criteria. Specifically, if an algorithm is symmetric (the order of inputs does not affect the result), has bounded loss and meets two stability conditions, it will generalize. The first stability condition, leave-one-out cross-validation stability, says that to be stable, the prediction error for each data point when leave-one-out cross validation is used must converge to zero as n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. The second condition, expected-to-leave-one-out error stability (also known as hypothesis stability if operating in the L_1 norm) is met if the prediction on a left-out datapoint does not change when a single data point is removed from the training dataset. These conditions can be formalized as: =Leave-one-out cross-validation Stability= An algorithm L has CVloo stability if for each n, there exists a \\\\beta_{CV}^{(n)} and \\\\delta_{CV}^{(n)} such that: :\\\\forall i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,...,n\\\\\\\\}, \\\\mathbb{P}_S\\\\\\\\{V(f_{S^i},z_i)-V(f_S,z_i)\\\\leq\\\\beta_{CV}^{(n)}\\\\\\\\}\\\\geq1-\\\\delta_{CV}^{(n)} and \\\\beta_{CV}^{(n)} and \\\\delta_{CV}^{(n)} go to zero as n goes to infinity. =Expected-leave-one-out error Stability= An algorithm L has Eloo_{err} stability if for each n there exists a \\\\beta_{EL}^m and a \\\\delta_{EL}^m such that: :\\\\forall i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,...,n\\\\\\\\}, \\\\mathbb{P}_S\\\\\\\\{I[f_S]-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N V(f_{S^{i}},z_i)\\\\leq\\\\beta_{EL}^{(n)}\\\\\\\\}\\\\geq1-\\\\delta_{EL}^{(n)} with \\\\beta_{EL}^{(n)} and \\\\delta_{EL}^{(n)} going to zero for n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. For leave-one-out stability in the L_1 norm, this is the same as hypothesis stability: : \\\\mathbb{E}_{S,z}[V(f_S,z) - V(f_{S^i},z)] \\\\leq \\\\beta_H^{(n)} with \\\\beta_H^{(n)} going to zero as n goes to infinity. = Algorithms with proven stability = A number of algorithms have been proven to be stable and as a result have bounds on their generalization error. A list of these algorithms and the papers that proved stability is available here.  Relation to overfitting  File:RegressionOverfitting.pngthumbThis figure illustrates the relationship between overfitting and the generalization error I[fn] - IS[fn]. Data points were generated from the relationship y = x with white noise added to the y values. In the left column, a set of training points is shown in blue. A seventh order polynomial function was fit to the training data. In the right column, the function is tested on data sampled from the underlying joint probability distribution of x and y. In the top row, the function is fit on a sample dataset of 10 datapoints. In the bottom row, the function is fit on a sample dataset of 100 datapoints. As we can see, for small sample sizes and complex functions, the error on the training set is small but error on the underlying distribution of data is large and we have overfit the data. As a result, generalization error is large. As the number of sample points increases, the prediction error on training and test data converges and generalization error goes to 0. The concepts of generalization error and overfitting are closely related. Overfitting occurs when the learned function f_S becomes sensitive to the noise in the sample. As a result, the function will perform well on the training set but not perform well on other data from the joint probability distribution of x and y. Thus, the more overfitting occurs, the larger the generalization error. The amount of overfitting can be tested using cross-validation methods, that split the sample into simulated training samples and testing samples. The model is then trained on a training sample and evaluated on the testing sample. The testing sample is previously unseen by the algorithm and so represents a random sample from the joint probability distribution of x and y. This test sample allows us to approximate the expected error and as a result approximate a particular form of the generalization error. Many algorithms exist to prevent overfitting. The minimization algorithm can penalize more complex functions (known as Tikhonov regularization), or the hypothesis space can be constrained, either explicitly in the form of the functions or by adding constraints to the minimization function (Ivanov regularization). The approach to finding a function that does not overfit is at odds with the goal of finding a function that is sufficiently complex to capture the particular characteristics of the data. This is known as the bias‚Äìvariance tradeoff. Keeping a function simple to avoid overfitting may introduce a bias in the resulting predictions, while allowing it to be more complex leads to overfitting and a higher variance in the predictions. It is impossible to minimize both simultaneously. References Further reading * Bousquet, O., S. Boucheron and G. Lugosi. Introduction to Statistical Learning Theory.

It is situated approximately south of Bridlington and north of Hornsea on the B1242 road at its junction with the B1249 road. The civil parish is formed by the village of Skipsea and the hamlets of Skipsea Brough and Dringhoe. According to the 2011 UK census, Skipsea parish had a population of 693, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 633. From the mediaeval era until the 19th century Skipsea was part of Dickering Wapentake. Between 1894 and 1974 Skipsea was a part of the Bridlington Rural District, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Between 1974 and 1996 it was part of the Borough of North Wolds (later Borough of East Yorkshire), in the county of Humberside. Just to the west of the village, in Skipsea Brough, lies Skipsea Castle. Built in 1086, the motte-and-bailey style castle has since been destroyed; however impressive earthworks remain. The coast near Skipsea, just over to the east, is the fastest eroding coastline in northern Europe.  History  Motte of Skipsea Castle The first recorded appearance of the name Skipsea is in the 12th century and the name is of Scandinavian origin, but the actual town-site has been in use much longer. This is of no real surprise, as this part of the English coast was frequented by Viking invaders before the Norman Conquest. There is some evidence that the name Skipsea refers to its original Viking meaning of \\"Ship Lake\\", but the closest literal meaning of Skipsea is \\"a lake navigable by ships\\". This name refers to the village's original location on the edge of a lake, which was suitable for navigation and eel-fishing, that was slightly inland from the sea. This land has since been lost because of erosion, making Skipsea a seaside Village. There is evidence of habitation dating back to the Stone and Bronze Ages because of the 19th century archaeological discovery of platforms, presumably for huts. The borough of Skipsea Castle was first recorded between 1160 and 1175 and may have been founded by William le Gros, Count of Aumale, who died in 1179. By the end of the 11th century, both Skipsea Castle and a church had been built, which encouraged the growth of a small town. In the following 13th and 14th centuries, local markets and fairs were granted \\"variously for Skipsea town, Skipsea manor, and Skipsea Brough manor, presumably all the same and possibly by then meaning Skipsea village\\". The parish church of All Saints was designated a Grade I listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The village is also famous for being a possible site for nuclear testing in the 1950s, yet the scientists at Aldermaston relented after strong opposition by the local community. The Royal Observer Corps used Skipsea as a site for a Cold War observation post. The site was active from October 1959 until its decommissioning in September 1991. The site lay derelict until it was restored by an enthusiast in October 2008. Currently, the economy of Skipsea is based on agriculture and tourism.

He was the general secretary of the Samajwadi Party and was a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. On 6 January 2010, he resigned from all the posts of the Samajwadi Party and was later expelled from the party by its chief, Mulayam Singh Yadav, on 2 February 2010. In 2011, he was arrested and spent a brief period in jail for his alleged involvement in the cash-for-votes scandal. In 2016, he was elected to Rajya Sabha with support from Samajwadi Party even after facing a stiff opposition from a section of the party including the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav. He was also reinstated as one of the general secretaries of the party in October 2016. On August 1, 2020, at the age of 64, Singh died while battling kidney ailment in Singapore. Early life Amar Singh was born on 27 January 1956 at Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh to a Rajput family. He got his early education at his native place. Afterward his family moved to Kolkata where he completed his graduation from St. Xavier's College and had his law education from University College of Law, Kolkata. Amar Singh started his career as a liaison officer of K.K. Birla. K.K. Birla was the owner of Hindustan Times. Working with Birla he made inroads in journalist fraternity. Political career Singh's prominence in Delhi surged when the UPA government was reduced to a minority after the Communist Party of India withdrew their support over the proposed Nuclear Accord with the United States. His Samajwadi Party pledged support to the UPA government with the support of its 39 members. Singh along with his close associate Jaya Prada were expelled from the Samajwadi Party in February, 2010 for anti party activities. On 21 December 2010, Singh launched his official website and blog. Singh floated his own political party, Rashtriya Lok Manch, in 2011, and fielded candidates in 360 of the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh in the 2012 assembly polls. However his party did not win a single seat in these elections. He joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal party in March 2014, contested the general elections that year from Fatehpur Sikri, Uttar Pradesh in 2014 Indian general election and lost. He was admitted at a hospital in Dubai with kidney failure and was stated to be critical on 19 February 2013.

Later, Samajwadi Party expelled the six MPs for defying the party directive during the confidence motion voting. He also courted controversy by asking for a probe in the Jamia Nagar Batla house encounter case. First he gave ‚Çπ10 lakh cheque to the family of Mohan Chand Sharma, a police officer who died in the encounter, which bounced when checked for its validity.

Amar Singh has been chargesheeted for offering bribes to three parliament members of the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2008 under the Prevention of Corruption Act by the Delhi Police on 24 August 2011. Amar Singh has pleaded health grounds for not appearing before the courts where the chargesheet was being heard. However, distressed by adverse media reports, Singh has appeared before the courts to dispel allegations that he is running away from the process of law. After hearing his personal pleas, the Court has sent Singh to judicial custody till 19 September 2011, in Delhi's Tihar jail.

Berlin Sportpalast (; built 1910, demolished 1973) was a multi-purpose indoor arena located in the Sch√∂neberg section of Berlin, Germany. Depending on the type of event and seating configuration, the Sportpalast could hold up to 14,000 people and was for a time the biggest meeting hall in Berlin. The Sportpalast is most known for speeches and rallies that took place during the Third Reich, particularly Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels's 1943 \\"Total War\\" speech.  Early years  Max Schmeling at Sportpalast, 1928. Built at Potsdamer Stra√üe 172, principally as an indoor ice rink for ice hockey and skating events, the Sportpalast was a sensation at the time of its opening in November 1910, and was at the time the largest such enclosed skating facility in the world. In later years, the Sportpalast also hosted non-winter sporting events such as six-day bicycle races and professional boxing matches in which well-known German boxer Max Schmeling fought. The Sportpalast was also used as a meeting hall for a variety of events, including political rallies and the Bockbierfest (Bock beer festival) with Bavarian bands, dancing, and roasted meat. During the tumultuous years of the Weimar Republic in the '20s and early '30s, the Sportpalast was used for the mass meetings of the major German political parties; within its walls, speakers from the Social Democrats, Communists and National Socialists outlined their programs and strategies to capacity crowds.  Third Reich and World War II years  Goebbels' Total War speech, early 1943. The banner says \\"Total war - shortest war.\\" Even after the Nazi Party gained power in 1933 and outlawed the other German political parties, the Sportpalast continued to be a popular venue for party rallies and important speeches by party leaders, including Adolf Hitler and Goebbels. Because of the size and propaganda potential of the Sportpalast, Goebbels is said to have labeled the hall as Unsere gro√üe politische Trib√ºne -- \\"our big political grandstand\\". In 1937 it was the site of an Assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler by an unknown person in a SS uniform. The Sportpalast was the site of Hitler's Winterhilfe address of September 4, 1940, in which he announced a shift to bombing of British cities rather than only military targets, heralding the beginning of the London Blitz. But the most significant of many Nazi speeches and rallies at the Sportpalast was Goebbels's Total War speech on February 18, 1943 ‚Äì two weeks after the disastrous German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. In his fanatical appeal to \\"totaler Krieg\\" before a select Nazi audience, Goebbels sought to rally the German people to heightened support for the war, which had begun to turn against Germany and was producing ever-growing casualty lists.  Postwar years  At war's end in 1945, the Sportpalast was in badly damaged condition with its roof destroyed. The building did not reopen for public ice sports until 1951, but these events were not popular because the rink was open to the elements and thus too cold for spectators to enjoy. A new roof was constructed later, with the building reopening in 1953. Among the notables who performed at the Sportpalast in its postwar years was world-famous figure skater Sonja Henie. Historical marker, Berlin-Sch√∂neberg In the early 1950s, banker Heinz Henschel attempted to revive the Sportpalast, which he previously played in as a member of the Berliner Schlittschuhclub. With the division of the city between East and West in the Cold War, the Sportpalast was situated in West Berlin. Although it was no longer the city's preeminent meeting hall, the Sportpalast in the postwar years hosted varied sorts of events, including rock concerts. Artists such as Bill Haley, Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, The Beach Boys, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, The Nice, and The Mothers of Invention performed at the Sportpalast during the building's final decades. By the 1970s, the operation of the hall was no longer profitable; the Sportpalast closed in 1973 and was torn down and replaced by a high-rise apartment complex, dubbed the \\"Sozialpalast\\" (de) - \\"the social housing palace\\".

It is made mainly from cereal grains, sugar and honey, formed into large yellow crunchy balls. It has a sweet, slightly honey-like flavour. The taste has been described as similar to the US cereal Cap'n Crunch. History Golden Nuggets were introduced in the 1970s in the United Kingdom and the United States, manufactured by Nabisco. They were then withdrawn from the UK market in the late 1970s. However, they were brought back to the UK in 1999 with a ¬£1 million advertising campaign, perhaps in response to demand from people who had enjoyed them in the 1970s and now had their own children. Marketing The packaging features various cartoon characters (drawn by Gary Dunn): Klondike Pete (a gold prospector who mines Golden Nuggets), his mule Pardner, his enemies - two claim-jumpers named Plum Loco Louie and Boot Hill Bob (jointly \\"The Breakfast Bandits\\") - and a Golden Nuggets Bee.. The Klondike Pete character was also used in the 1970s to market the US version of the cereal, Klondike Pete's Crunchy Nuggets. The box also sometimes features puzzles suited to the 7‚Äì12-year-old range. The cereal is marketed with the slogan \\"They taste Yeee-Haa!\\" (Previously \\"They're honey- crunchin' good!\\"). In 2002, as part of Nestl√©'s Lilo & Stitch promotion, chocolate-flavoured nuggets were mixed in with boxes of Golden Nuggets (which, according to Pete in the ads during this time, was Stitch's work) In 2019, the Labour Party listed the cereal among its targets as deputy leader Tom Watson decried the use of cartoon characters to entice children to highly sugared foods.

This non-flammable synthetic material has applications in semiconductor production and medicine. It is also an extremely potent greenhouse gas. Manufacture Octafluoropropane can be produced either by electrochemical fluorination or by the Fowler process using cobalt fluoride. Applications In the electronics industry, octafluoropropane is mixed with oxygen and used as a plasma etching material for SiO2 layers in semiconductor applications, as oxides are selectively etched versus their metal substrates. In medicine, octafluoropropane may compose the gas cores of microbubble contrast agents used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Octafluoropropane microbubbles reflect sound waves well and are used to improve the ultrasound signal backscatter. It is used in eye surgery, such as pars plana vitrectomy procedures where a retina hole or tear is repaired. The gas provides a long- term tamponade, or plug, of a retinal hole or tear and allows re-attachment of the retina to occur over the several days following the procedure. Under the name R-218, octafluoropropane is used in other industries as a component of refrigeration mixtures. It has been featured in some plans for terraforming Mars. With a greenhouse gas effect 24,000 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2), octafluoropropane could dramatically reduce the time and resources it takes to terraform Mars.

The word \\"tabor\\" is simply an English variant of a Latin-derived word meaning \\"drum\\"‚Äîcf. , Harms Historical Percussion's Tabor page. It has been used in the military as a marching instrument, and has been used as accompaniment in parades and processions. Construction Valencian tabor player A tabor has a cylindrical wood shell, two skin heads tightened by rope tension, a leather strap, and an adjustable snare. The single snare can be made from gut, silk, or rough hemp.Goldenberg, Morris. Modern School for Snare Drum with a Guide for the Artist Percussionist. USA: Chappell and Co., 1955. Each tabor has a pitch range of about an octave: the larger the tabor, the lower the pitch. It is played by just one short conical stick, made from bone or ivory, which usually strikes the snare head. The tabor is suspended by a strap from the forearm, somewhere between the elbow and wrist. When played, the shell is virtually parallel with the ground. In Spain, a deep drum is used for a tabor by pipe and taborers, and in England a shallow tom tom is sometimes used, although medieval icons of pipe and tabor usually display a large shallow tabor similar in shape to a bodhr√°n. Usage The tabor is most widely known as accompaniment for the pipe and other small flutes, such as the flageolet, and most famously as the percussive element in the \\"pipe and tabor\\" one-man band configuration. The tabor is beaten on the snare side. Georges Bizet scored for the tabor drum in his L'Arlesienne Suite No. 2, and Aaron Copland calls for it in his Appalachian Spring and El Sal√≥n M√©xico. Darius Milhaud has been named one of the foremost composers of modern (mid-20th century) music for the tabor by Morris Goldenberg. His Suite Provancale calls for tabor played along with two other drums by a single player. In classical repertoire the tabor is usually played with two sticks, as many pieces call for speeds that are unwieldy for a single hand. In many cases composers' scores have been mistranslated with the erroneous call for tambour de basque or tambourine when the piece was originally intended for tabor. Parts written for tabor are usually very simple and feature straight eight notes or another easy repetitive pattern.  History  One-handed roll performed on a Tabor The tabor is classified as a membranophone and dates back to the Medieval period in Europe. Hand-written documents and engravings are some of the earliest recordings of this instrument. The size of these early tabors ranged approximately 11-12 inches in diameter and 4-10 inches in width/depth. These 13th century tabors were thus larger across their diameter, but the tabor continued to evolve with time and eventually some were almost even in diameter and width. The 16th century design of the tabor changed to the opposite proportions from the earlier models with the width being greater. Tabors were constructed of wood for the body of the drum with the stretched membrane made out of some type of skin. It was primarily used for the outdoors. The tabor is a precursor to the side drum. The common way of playing the tabor together with the pipe produced the effect of a single person band. It was often played for dancing, and was sometimes played as a small ensemble with the bagpipes. Since the tabor was used to accompany dancing, regular rhythmic beats were common for this instrument. The tabor was used to accompany Morris style folk dancing. Initial documents show that a type of horn was played with the tabor, which then later lead into the pipe and tabor duo. This combination flourished in musical performances between the 13th-16th century and was connected with nobility. The tabor together with the pipe had the ability to make complicated musical timing meters. The tabor was also played solo. By the 15th century the size of the tabor increased. Players used two sticks instead of the original single stick to hit on the membrane. The larger 2-sticked version was predominantly used in military contexts, while the smaller single-sticked tabor was retained for dance music.Beck, John H. Encyclopedia of Percussion. Routledge, 2013. Tabor use decreased by the mid-17th century. The tabor did continue to evolve throughout the 19th and into the 20th century. The tabor style is still used as the tambourin de Provence.

His current practice involves holding one exhibition in Australia every two years, and up to three overseas exhibitions each year. The use of chiaroscuro\\"What becomes apparent when you see Henson‚Äôs work in person is the importance of the almost pitch-black darkness that, in whatever formal context he has devised over the years, always cloaks his forlorn, defiantly unneedy subjects, giving their run-down urban environments the look of remote desert outposts. It‚Äôs a black that seems both to be caked on the surface of the photographs, like tar or centuries of soot, and to recede infinitely into the background. It looks as solid as lead, a physical threat to the teens it blankets, and at the same time it‚Äôs as if the blackness were exuded by their bodies, forming a kind of paranormal manifestation of some feeling too intense and guarded to register in any other fashion. In its own peculiar way Henson‚Äôs black is as unique an achievement as, say, Robert Ryman‚Äôs white.\\" Dennis Cooper (2002) The Photography of Bill Henson: Naked Youth, Artforum International, No. 6, p.94-97 is common throughout his works, through underexposure and adjustment in printing. His photographs' use of bokeh is intended to give them a painterly atmosphere. The work is often presented as diptychs, triptychs and in other groupings, and the exhibitions are specifically curated by Henson to reflect a sense of musicality.\\"As the new Biss recording of Mozart's K364 Sinfonia Concertante, the Andante movement only, repeats itself endlessly on my stereo, the sound of Richard Tognetti and the ACO orchestra at their absolute greatest washes over me like a tsunami, while my head is also spinning with the staggering beauty of a single gesture made by a woman riding the escalator at the Westfield Doncaster shopping centre, and with just how Tognetti's violin sounds like she looked.

Duality is a recurring theme of Henson's work, often in combination with adolescent subjects.\\"And this sexiness that is there and emphasised is crucial to the austere pessimism of these works. But to see it as the point of the photographs, arraigning Henson as a purveyor of kiddie porn to the elite, is, putting it charitably, to miss the point. It‚Äôs like reading him as a centrefold photographer for whom the background is just backdrop. Or thinking the clothed figure in Titian‚Äôs Allegory of Vice and Virtue represents the good girl. What Henson is actually giving us is a series of shattered paysages moralis√©s, where the innocent sexiness of the bodies is posed against a landscape they are not part of ‚Äì the majestic, insensible alps (alps that bring to mind the poignancy, which had never struckeme before of Robbe-Grillet‚Äôs statement about how Mt Blanc had not been waiting since the Permian Age to be a symbol for Shelley). Henson‚Äôs alps appear like a scroll rolled back, to reveal a deus sive natura it is sentimental to even describe as pitiless.

He does his own colour processing in his bedroom[...]. He has referred to a 'certain morbidity' in his work. Well, that is an element of life too. The young ballerinas seem to be under a spell, in thrall. At one and the same time he is tender artist and tyrant. The delicacy and control of colour in these shades will excite wonderment and pleasure, where a hint of coral light imbues the lobe of an ear, or minuscule catchlight alights with barest touch on the tip of eyelashes or edges the profiled iris of her eye. At times he teases with only a suggestion of vaporous form, but the presence breathes within the frame.

Rockbridge was laid down for the Maritime Commission (MCV hull 674) on 2 September 1944 by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company in Vancouver, Washington, launched on 28 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. C. J. Hearn, acquired by the Navy on loan-charter on 18 November 1944; and commissioned the same day, with Captain William W. Cone in command. Service history =1944-1947= The new attack transport arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 February 1945, sailed for Iwo Jima on the 20th, and operated off that island for two weeks. She returned to Seattle, Washington, on 28 May and on 6 June embarked Army troops for Okinawa. Rockbridge arrived at the Hagushi anchorage on 24 July to debark the men and discharge cargo. During the six days she spent off Okinawa, the ship was harassed by night air attacks, but suffered no damage because of the concealing smoke made by all the vessels in the harbor. Rockbridge was off Ulithi in mid-August when the Japanese surrender was announced. During September and October she made two voyages to Japan with occupation troops and then joined the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet to bring home servicemen eligible for discharge. Assigned to Joint Task Force 1 in the spring of 1946, she served as a floating hotel for the crews of target vessels , , and during that summer's atomic bomb tests on Bikini. Rockbridge was decommissioned on 8 March 1947 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. =1950-1968= After the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, she was ordered reactivated. She was recommissioned on 23 December 1950, and in May 1951 joined Amphibious Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. From 1951 to 1968, the transport participated in numerous amphibious training programs at Onslow Beach, North Carolina, Little Creek, Virginia; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Vieques, Puerto Rico. During her long service, she made eight Mediterranean cruises. Highlights included her participation in \\"Weldfast\\" a large-scale NATO operation in 1953, standby alert for possible evacuation of U.S. citizens from Egypt during the 1956 Suez Canal nationalization crisis, and aid to earthquake victims of Greece in 1953; and to flood victims in France in 1959. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962, Rockbridge carried reinforcements to Guantanamo Bay and returned to the United States for additional troops, which she held in combat readiness until December. In January 1964 Rockbridge, along with other ships from Phibron 8, was in Cristobal, Panama during the riots. She spent roughly 45 days tied up at the Coco Solo Naval Air Station. During July, 1966, the transport took part in the production of an amphibious training film, Boat Group Tactics, filmed in Hampton Roads, Virginia. Rockbridge also starred in The Proud and Profane and supported the filming of PT-109. A boat crew from Rockbridge was assigned to the film crew to operate the LCVP and Japanese landing craft used in the film. Rockbridge was again decommissioned on 29 November 1968, struck from the Navy List on 1 December 1968 and sold to Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland, on 27 May 1969 for scrapping. For her World War II service, Rockbridge received one battle star.

It is the last book Radcliffe published during her lifetime (although she would go on to write the novel Gaston de Blondeville, it was only published posthumously in 1826). The Italian has a dark, mysterious, and somber tone which fixates on the themes of love, devotion, and persecution during the time period of Holy Inquisition. The novel deals with issues prevalent at the time of the French Revolution, such as religion, aristocracy, and nationality. Radcliffe's renowned use of veiled imagery is considered to have reached its height of sophistication and complexity in The Italian; concealment and disguise are central motifs of the novel. In line with late 18th-century sensibility and its parallel fetishisation of the sublime and the sentimentally pastoral, the heightened emotional states of Radcliffe's characters are often reflected through the pathetic fallacy. The novel is noted for its extremely effective antagonist, Father Schedoni,Murray, E.B. \\"Ann Radcliffe\\". Twayne, 1972, p.135. who influenced the Byronic characters of Victorian literature. Characters *Vincentio di Vivaldi: Son of the Marchese and Marchesa of Naples; Ellena's suitor *Ellena Rosalba: Orphan niece of Signora Bianchi; Daughter of Sister Olivia; Vivaldi's lover *Father Schedoni/ Count di Marinella: Confessor to the Marchesa; uncle to Ellena *Marchesa di Vivaldi: Mother of Vivaldi; Conspirator with Schedoni *Marchese di Vivaldi: Father of Vivaldi *Paulo: Servant of Vivaldi *Signora Bianchi: Aunt of Ellena *Sister Olivia/ Countess di Bruno: Nun at San Stefano Convent, Mother of Ellena *Spalatro: Conspirator with Schedoni and the Marchesa *Nicola di Zampari: Accuser of Schedoni; Informer to Vivaldi *Less Significant Characters: Bonarmo, Lady Abbess of San Stefano, Inquisitors, Father Ansaldo, Beatrice, Jeronimo  Locations  *Naples: City where Vivaldi, his parents, Ellena, Schedoni, Paulo and Signora Bianchi reside *Villa Altieri: Residence of Ellena and Signora Bianchi *San Lorenzo: Church where Vivaldi first meets Ellena and Signora Bianchi *San Stefano: Convent to Sister Olivia; prison to Ellena *Santa Maria del Pianto/ Santa del Pianto: Convent and Monastery referenced to *Prison of the Inquisition Plot The plot starts in Naples, Italy in the 18th century, in the church of Santa Maria del Pianto, where an English traveller is speaking with an Italian friar. The Englishman notices a man of extraordinary appearance in a shadowy area of the church, who is an assassin, according to the friar. When the Englishman asks why this assassin is protected in the church, an Italian friend travelling with him directs his attention to a famous confessional in the church, which was the scene of a particularly startling confession. He offers to send him a narrative relating this former assassin's confession, and the problems that attended it, to his hotel, and the two retire from the church and go their separate ways. The Englishman reads the story in his hotel room as follows: It is 1758 in the church of San Lorenzo in Naples where Vincentio di Vivaldi sees the beautiful Ellena di Rosalba with her aunt, Signora Bianchi. Vivaldi is struck with her beauty, and intends to court her, with the hopes that they will end up married. When Vivaldi‚Äôs mother, the proud Marchesa, hears about his love for a poor orphan, she appeals to her ambitious and cunning confessor, Father Schedoni, to prevent the marriage, with a promise that she will help him obtain promotion in his order. As Vivaldi continues to visit Signora Bianchi at Villa Altieri, he is approached by a monk, who seems to be an apparition, threatening him to keep away from the villa and Ellena. After each encounter, Vivaldi tries in vain to capture the strange monk, with the help of his friend Bonarmo and his faithful servant Paulo. Vivaldi suspects that the monk is Father Schedoni, and is determined to know why his courtship of Ellena is discouraged. After being promised the hand of Ellena and appointed her guardian by Signora Bianchi before her sudden mysterious death, Vivaldi finds that Ellena has been kidnapped from the villa, and immediately deduces it is by the hand of the Marchesa and Schedoni. Leaving Naples secretly in pursuit of her abductors, Vivaldi and Paulo eventually find Ellena held at the remote convent of San Stefano, at the mercy of a cruel Lady Abbess, and Vivaldi infiltrates the convent disguised as a religious pilgrim to rescue her. In the convent, Ellena befriends a lovely but melancholy nun, Sister Olivia, who helps her escape from the convent into the care of Vivaldi. While riding towards Naples after the escape, Vivaldi presses Ellena for an immediate marriage, and she finally consents. But moments before they are to take their vows before a priest at a church, agents for the Inquisition, informed by Schedoni, interrupt and arrest Vivaldi on the false charge of abducting a nun from a convent. Vivaldi and Paulo are taken to the prisons of the Inquisition in Rome to be questioned and put to trial. They are confused about the circumstances behind their confinement, which their captors will not reveal. Ellena, however, is sent by order of Schedoni to a lone house on the seashore, inhabited only by the villain Spalatro, Schedoni's accomplice in previous crimes, to be murdered. Schedoni comes to the house to assassinate Ellena personally, but becomes convinced from a portrait on her person that she is his daughter. Schedoni has a change of heart, and decides to take Ellena personally back to Naples to hide her from the Marchesa. While on their journey, they once again encounter the dismissed Spalatro, who had followed them with designs of extorting money from Schedoni, but Spalatro is shot in a scuffle and left behind (and shortly after dies of fever). Schedoni and Ellena arrive in Naples, where Schedoni places Ellena in the convent of Santa Maria del Pianto until Vivaldi can be freed. Schedoni returns to the Marchesa, keeping secret his endorsement of the marriage of the Marchesa's son and his daughter, but distracts the Marchesa temporarily with information that Ellena comes from a noble lineage, so a marriage would at least be proper, if not lucrative. Meanwhile, in the prison of the Inquisition, the mysterious monk who had previously eluded Vivaldi, now known to be Nicola di Zampari, appears and narrates to him the guilty crimes of Father Schedoni before he became a monk, and convinces him to formally call Schedoni and Father Ansaldo, to whom Schedoni had previously disclosed his deeds in a confessional booth, to the trial as the accused and witness, respectively, in the crimes. Both are made to appear before the tribunal, where Schedoni is convicted from their testimony of murdering his brother, as well as marrying and later stabbing his brother's wife in a jealous rage, in his former life as the dissolute Count di Bruno, or Count di Marinella. Schedoni is sentenced to death, and before he is led away into confinement, tells Vivaldi his relationship to Ellena and her whereabouts. Vivaldi is also escorted back to his cell, with the knowledge that the charges against him will be dropped. Schedoni, on his deathbed, in the presence of the tribunal, further reveals that he had already fatally poisoned both himself and his betrayer Nicola with poison concealed in his vest. Schedoni also had notified the Marchese of Vivaldi's situation, who hurries to Rome to secure his son's release. Back at the convent, Ellena distinguishes a voice all too familiar, and sees her dearly loved Sister Olivia in the convent courtyard. While the two recount each other's experiences since they last parted, Ellena‚Äôs servant Beatrice comes to report the sudden death of the Marchesa from a long-dormant but natural illness (having Confessed, the Marchesa has also exacted a promise from her husband that he should sanction the marriage of Ellena and Vivaldi). Beatrice and Olivia recognize each other, and elate Ellena with the news that she is the daughter of Olivia and the Countess di Bruno, whom Schedoni had stabbed in jealous rage and left for dead, from which fact Ellena realises that she is actually not Schedoni‚Äôs daughter, but his niece. Since they are of the same lineage, Ellena is still from a noble family, which would allow her to marry Vivaldi with honour. Once it is revealed that Ellena is from an aristocratic family, it is determined that she has the ROYAL BLOOD that allows her to be worthy of marrying Vivaldi. The ending of the novel is a happy one; Vivaldi and Paulo are released from prison, Ellena is reunited with her mother, and Vivaldi and Ellena are joined in marriage, and all the villains have died. The Marchesa dies shortly before finding out that her son has been freed from prison. Father Schedoni, condemned to die, poisons himself and Nicola di Zampari, and calls a tribunal including the Marchese and Vivaldi to witness their final confessions at his deathbed. Imagery Ann Radcliffe uses the technique of scene imagery to evoke emotion in characters, and to describe landscapes and surroundings in extreme detail. The most notable imagery in the novel are from art pieces and the picturesque. The actual artists ‚Äúmentioned were seventeenth century Italian artists with those works Mrs. Radcliffe was probably familiar‚Äù,Swigart, Ford Harris. \\"A Study of the Imagery in the Gothic Romances of Ann Radcliffe\\". University of Pittsburgh, 1966, p.12. while the characters also turn into artists who paint portraits of other characters in their heads. Sculptures can be seen in the tribunal members of the Inquisition for their faces are unyielding and hard as stone, and even the flickering lamps cannot soften their facial expressions. Aside from imagery being described as physical art, Radcliffe includes images of personification, animals, religion, storms, magic, and enchantment. As noted by E.J. Clery, \\"Radcliffe's heroines are women of imagination. By their taste for scenery and aptitude for fancy they transform the plots of sentimental fiction into otherwordly romance: they are effectively the co-authors of their own stories.‚Äù‚ÄúAnn Radcliffe.‚Äù Women's Gothic: From Clara Reeve to Mary Shelley, by E. J. Clery, Liverpool University Press, 2004, pp. 51‚Äì84. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv5rf49t.7. Images in the novel make it possible to see one thing in the expressions of something else,[Swigart, Ford Harris. \\"A Study of the Imagery in the Gothic Romances of Ann Radcliffe\\". University of Pittsburgh, 1966, p.4.] reason as to which Radcliffe creates anxiety from descriptions of terror and the uncanny. ‚ÄúThe solemnity of the scene accorded with the temper of his mind, and he listened in deep attention for returning sounds, which broke upon his ear like distant thunder muttering imperfectly from the clouds.‚Äù (page 12 Oxford World Classics Edition) All of the imagery presented in The Italian pull the novel together by way of description, which sets the scene for the reader and the characters.  Female Gothic and Poetics in The Italian  Ann Radliffe's writing falls under the genre of the female gothic, which is distinguished by the use of the supernatural and the poetic language used in descriptions and events. For example, one such description in Chapter 5 reads, \\"Along this deep and shadowy perspective a river, which was seen descending among the cliffs of a mountain, rolled with impetuous force, fretting and foaming amidst the dark rocks in its descent, and then flowing in a limpid lapse to the brink of other precipices, whence again it fell with thundering strength to the abyss, throwing its misty clouds of spray high in the air, and seeming to claim the sole empire of this solitary wild.\\" As mentioned above, Radcliffe's love of nature finds its way into much of her writing and poetry. \\"...there are passages in all of her tales save the last (in which nature plays no part) and in her posthumously-published descriptive poetry which seem to indicate a genuine love of the out-of-doors and an eye for aspects of nature that were not often noticed in her time.\\" Her interspersed poetry throughout the novel is arguably used to draw attention to certain characters' personalities, morals, and emotional states. Reception The Italian was first announced in December 1796. At the time of the novel's release, Ann Ward Radcliffe was already a well-known and well-received Gothic writer. She had gained fame from several of her earlier works, most noticeably The Romance of the Forest in 1791 and The Mysteries of Udolpho in 1794. Her reputation was successful enough to allow her to be read by learned gentlemen as well as young men and women. Because the term 'gothic story‚Äô was not commonly used in this period of time, Radcliffe's contemporaries used the term ‚Äòromance‚Äô to describe her genre. This term was classified as writing about miraculous tales through the use of poetic prose. This poetic element was referred to in multiple reviews of Radcliffe's The Italian and is considered to be the defining characteristic of the author's many Gothic works. This unique characteristic of her writing set the author apart from other writers of the time and earned her a reputation through the appraisal she received from many well-respected literary voices of the time. In general praise for the author, Sir Walter Scott called her 'the first poetess of romance fiction‚Äô; while Nathan Drake wrote that she was, 'the Shakespeare of Romance writers'. He believed that her readers valued her unrivaled ability to create ‚Äì to realise visually ‚Äì an enchanted, storied, and landscaped past. In a time where writing novels for commercial consumption was one of the only means through which a female author could earn a respectable living, The Italian was a great financial success for Radcliffe. Because of her reputation and earlier success, the author earned ¬£800 from the original copyright of the novel, which was considered a very large sum for a female author and was unparalleled by many of Radcliffe's contemporaries. The Italian prompted a wide variety of both favourable and unfavorable reviews, making the overall reception of the novel very mixed. To some critics, it was the high point of Ann Radcliffe's short but productive career; to others, it represented a distinct decline in form from her earlier products. Most reviewers were united in believing that the monk Schedoni was the most successful character that Radcliffe had created in any of her novels. Characterized as a man governed by an amalgam of anger, hypocrisy and guilt, the monk was praised as standing apart from the traditional conventions of Gothic protagonists, and many readers approved of his strong personality. Not only was he considered one of the best characters, but one of the best villains; he had \\"great energy, with strong passions, and inordinate pride; sometimes softened by the feelings of humanity, but preserving the firmnesss of his mind in the most trying situations\\". However, many of these reviews found a fault in the extent of his wicked nature, and others asserted that Radcliffe's careful handling of his character and attempt to implement a touch of parental affection to soften him only served to make him seem less realistic. Reviews that were run in response to The Italian echo these tensions between approval and disappointment in what would be the final novel of Radcliffe's Gothic career. The writer of an 1827 review in the United States Review and Literary Gazette declares his belief that The Italian is Radcliffe's \\"greatest work,\\" paying particular reverence to the \\"masterly dialogues\\" in several key scenes, including the interview between Marchesa and Schedoni in the church of San Nicolo as well as the discussion between Schedoni and Spalatro, in which the later refuses to murder Ellena. The writer of a 1797 review in The Monthly Review praised Radcliffe's visual and descriptive language in the novel, citing \\"the part‚Ä¶which displays the greatest genius, and the most force of description, is the account of the scenes which passed in the long house on the shore of the Adriatic, between Schedoni, Ellena, and Spalatro: ‚Äì The horrible sublimity which characterizes the discovery made by the former that Ellena was his daughter, at the instant in which he was about to stab her, was perhaps unparalleled.‚Äù This style of 'painting the sublime‚Äô reflects the preference for allegorical or transcendent imagery over physical or realistic imagery in the Gothic literary and artistic period. Originating in the works of Edmund Burke's On the Sublime and Beautiful, which also parallels Radcliffe's preference in the use of terror over horror in her novels. Similarly, a later evaluation in the Edinburgh Review described the mastery of Ann Radcliffe's narrative description as allowing the reader to almost see, feel and experience the events on the Mediterranean alongside the characters. However, various negative reviews emerged and had issues when comparing The Italian to Radcliffe's earlier and more overwhelmingly successful pieces. Several articles commented on the difficulty the author had in maintaining her reputation after her early success. The writer of The English Review‚Äôs article on The Italian in December 1796 attempted to make a rational assessment of the disappointment that some people felt in reading the novel, saying that: ‚ÄúIt was impossible to raise curiosity and expectation to a higher pitch than she has done in her Mysteries of Udolpho; yet these mysteries she accounted for in a natural manner.‚Äù Having been frightened perfectly by Radcliffe before, this critique believed that readers were likely prepared for the twists of The Italian. There was also some unfavorable criticism of the scenes dealing with the Spanish Inquisition, which are sometimes considered too unrealistic or ridiculous to be believable to the audience. A review in The Critical Review from June 1798 stated that, \\"Among those parts of the romance which we disapprove, we may reckon the examination before the court of inquisition: it is so improbable, that we should rather have attributed it to one of Mrs. Radcliffe's numerous imitators.‚Äù Despite this, the review went on to say that there still remained several scenes that would successfully seize the imagination and interest the passions of readers. Following Radcliffe's retirement after this novel at the young age of thirty-two, and her death a few years later, public opinion of her overall works including The Italian swung to a more positive light. Upon her death in 1823, the political and social atmosphere in England had changed again and Radcliffe regained positive assessments of her importance in the history of Gothic writers. In her obituary in the New Monthly Magazine, she was described as \\"the able authoress of some of the best romances that ever appeared in the English language;\\" in the Literary Gazette she was, \\"the finest writer in this kind of fiction that ever existed;\\" and in the Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine she was noted to have produced romances that we able to be translated into 'every European tongue‚Äô to the 'honor of the country.‚Äô  Symbols  The Veil (Nun's Habit) - The veil, used by Ellena to aid her escape with Vivaldi after being captured, was given to her by Sister Olivia. This veil appears almost obsessively through the work, symbolizing modesty, and reassuring protection and concealment of purpose. * Modesty - In the scene where Vivaldi and Ellena meet in a church, Vivaldi falls in love with Ellena because of her beautiful voice and his desire to see her, as she is hidden behind the veil. This unveiling is through nature, not masculine desire as a breeze from the water caught the veil. This is an important scene in relevance to the veil as it shows how Ellena is not passive and does not need to be unveiled by Vivaldi. * Reassuring Protection and Concealment of Purpose - Since the veil is given to her by Sister Olivia (later found to be Ellena's mother) it protects her by disguising Ellena as she escapes from her prisons. The veil allows her a means of communicating safely with the other nuns and later Vivaldi. However, the veil is also what keeps her from her immediate marriage to Vivaldi. Relation to The Monk The Italian appears to have been written in response to Matthew Gregory Lewis' The Monk, which was released a year earlier in 1796. Lewis and Radcliffe both influenced the tradition of the Gothic novel, but did so in different ways. As an already established author, Radcliffe was a large influence in Lewis's writing career. Their notoriety and aesthetic contrasts led to the two often being compared ‚Äì even by the authors themselves. Even as recently as 2005, writers such as Vartan Messier compare their styles: \\"The contrast between the two writers is obvious in their approach to the Gothic, and more particularly, in the explicitness of content and in their use of certain Gothic conventions.\\"Messier, Vartan P. \\"The conservative, the transgressive, and the reactionary: Ann Radcliffe's The Italian as a response to Matthew Lewis' The Monk.\\" Atenea, vol. 25, no. 2, 2005, p. 37+. Literature Resource Center, https://link-gale- com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/apps/doc/A169717177/LitRC?u=maine_orono&sid;=LitRC&xid;=a2ec3b4d. Accessed 12 Dec. 2019. Radcliffe strove toward poetic realism and explained the supernatural as a product of natural causes, while Lewis exulted in pastiche and irony while choosing to leave the supernatural effects unexplained. Where Radcliffe would allude to the imagined horrors under the genre of terror-gothic, Lewis defined himself by disclosing the details of the gruesome scenes, earning him the title of horror-gothic novelist. Radcliffe, who considered herself to be a writer of the terror aspect of the Gothic genre, preferred to elicit feelings of sublimity and true emotional reactions with her shocking moments of writing. Unlike the characters in Lewis‚Äô novel, reviewers observed that Radcliffe illustrated that guilt and depravity can be constructed upon the desire for absolute power rather than mere sexuality, and their source is ultimately human rather than demonic. The direction in which Gothic literature was moving, from terror to horror, may have inhibited Radcliffe from continuing her career. A gender comparison can also be seen between The Italian and The Monk; Radcliffe indirectly depicts the desires that Lewis investigates explicitly.Moglen, Helene. \\"Trauma of Gender: A Feminist Theory of the English Novel.\\" Trauma of Gender: A Feminist Theory of the English Novel. 2001, p. 153.

Early years Radas≈Ça≈≠ Astro≈≠ski was born on 25 October 1887 in the town of Zapolle, Slutsk Uyezd, Minsk Governorate. He studied at the Slutsk gymnasium, but was expelled for participating in the Russian Revolution of 1905‚Äì1907. In 1908 he was accepted to the mathematical faculty of Saint Petersburg University. In 1911, he was arrested for taking part in revolutionary riots and was imprisoned at Saint Petersburg and Pskov. After his release in 1912, he re-entered the university and later transferred to the University of Tartu, from where he graduated with a degree in physics and mathematics. After University, Astro≈≠ski worked as a teacher in Czƒôstochowa, Poland and in Minsk. From 1915 to 1917 he taught at the Minsk Teaching Institute. After the February Revolution of 1917 he became the commissar of the Provisional Government in Slutsk paviet. In September of the same year he founded the Slutsk Belarusian Gymnasium and became its principal. Astro≈≠ski opposed the October Revolution of 1917. He was a delegate to the December 1917 First All-Belarusian Congress and published articles where he supported the idea of Belarusian independence. In 1918 Astro≈≠ski was Education Minister in the government of the Belarusian Democratic Republic under Prime Minister Raman Skirmunt. He also took part in the 1920 Slutsk defence action against the Red Army. Political activity in West Belarus In 1921, he moved into West Belarus in the Second Polish Republic. He served as principal of the Belarusian Gymnasium of Vilnia from 1924 to 1936. In the second half of the 1920s, he radically changed his political views. In 1924 he initiated the creation of a Polish-Belarusian Society that supported the Polish government. After the breakdown of the Society, Astro≈≠ski cooperated with the Belarusian Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) and with the Communist Party of West Belarus, and managed the illegal komsomol cell in his gymnasium. In 1925 and 1926 he was the vice-chairman of the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, the chairman of the Belarusian School Society, and the principal of the Belarusian Cooperation Bank in Wilno, used to transfer finances to the BPWU. In 1926, Astro≈≠ski joined the Communist Party of West Belarus and was arrested by the Polish police. However, during the trial against the Hramada he was found not guilty. From 1928, he once again changed his political orientation and started to call for cooperation with Polish officials. For that he was condemned by many leaders of the Western Belarusian national movement. In the mid-1930s he published various works in Belarusian calendar books and in the \\"Rodny Kraj\\" newspaper, under the pseudonym \\"Era\\". In 1936 he had to leave Wilno and moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫.

In 1956, he moved to the United States and lived in South River, New Jersey.

The doctor and his beautiful young niece, Gayle Clayton (Carlisle), and her fianc√©, soon discover that Elwyn still lives, and are in peril of their lives for this knowledge.

The novel depicts three months in the life of a 26-year-old former high school basketball player named Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom who is trapped in a loveless marriage and a boring sales job, and his attempts to escape the constraints of his life. It spawned several sequels, including Rabbit Redux, Rabbit is Rich and Rabbit at Rest, as well as a related 2001 novella, Rabbit Remembered. In these novels Updike takes a comical and retrospective look at the relentless questing life of Rabbit against the background of the major events of the latter half of the 20th century. Plot summary Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom, formerly a high school basketball star, is now 26, and has a job selling a kitchen gadget named MagiPeeler. He is married to Janice, who was a salesgirl at the store where he once worked, and who is now pregnant. They live in Mount Judge, a suburb of Brewer, Pennsylvania, and have a two-year-old son named Nelson. Harry finds middle-class family life unsatisfying, and, on the spur of the moment, he leaves his family and drives south in an attempt to \\"escape\\". After getting lost, he returns to his home town, but not wanting to return to his family, he instead visits his old basketball coach, Marty Tothero. That night, Harry has dinner with Tothero and two girls, one of whom, Ruth Leonard, is a part-time prostitute. Harry and Ruth begin a two-month affair and he soon moves into her apartment. Meanwhile, Janice moves back with her parents. The local Episcopal priest, Jack Eccles, tries to persuade Harry to reconcile with his wife. But Harry stays with Ruth until he learns she had a fling with his high school nemesis, Ronnie Harrison. Enraged, Harry coaxes Ruth into performing fellatio on him. The same night, Harry learns that Janice is in labor, and he leaves Ruth to visit his wife at the hospital. Reconciled with Janice, Harry moves back into their home where their daughter, Rebecca June, awaits them. Harry attends church one morning and, after walking the minister's wife Lucy home, interprets her invitation to come in for a coffee as a sexual advance. When he declines the invitation for coffee, stating that he has a wife, she angrily slams the door on him. Harry returns to his apartment, and, happy about the birth of his daughter, tries to reconcile with Janice. He encourages her to have a whiskey, then, misreading her mood, pressures her to have sex despite her postnatal condition. When she refuses and accuses him of treating her like a prostitute, Harry masturbates onto her and then leaves in an attempt to resume his relationship with Ruth. Finding her apartment empty, he spends the night at a hotel. The next morning, still distraught at Harry's treatment of her, Janice gets drunk and accidentally drowns Rebecca June in the bath tub. The other main characters in the book except Harry soon learn of the accident and gather at Janice's parents' home. Later in the day, unaware of what has happened, Harry calls Reverend Eccles to see how his return home would be received. Reverend Eccles shares the news of his daughter's death, and Harry returns home. Tothero later visits Harry and suggests that the thing he is looking for probably does not exist. At Rebecca June's funeral, Harry's internal and external conflicts result in a sudden proclamation of his innocence in the baby's death. He then runs from the graveyard, pursued by Jack Eccles, until he becomes lost. Harry returns to Ruth and learns that she is pregnant by him. Though Harry is relieved to discover she has not had an abortion, he is unwilling to divorce Janice. Harry abandons Ruth, still missing the feeling he has attempted to grasp during the course of the novel; his fate is uncertain as the novel concludes.

Updike said that when he looked around in 1959 he saw a number of scared dodgy men who could not make commitments, men who peaked in high school and existed in a downward spiral. Their idea of happiness was to be young. In 1959 America the Late Modernism period was coming to an end, and Updike inherited the cultural legacy of Modernism. With this legacy, that lacks spiritual vitality and potent erotic traditions, Rabbit has no vocabulary to give voice to his sexual and spiritual conundrums and feelings. In the novel the norms of Modernism are being replaced with those of a new era with a desiccated view of spirituality and a revaluation of eroticism, things previously held constant and in some cases repressed in traditional American thought.Fekete, D. J. (2007). John Updike's Rabbit, Run: A quest for a spiritual vocabulary in the vacuum left by modernism. Religious Studies and Theology, 26(1), 25. The title matches the popular World War II-era song \\"Run Rabbit Run\\".  Major themes  = Sex = Updike said, \\"About sex in general, by all means let's have it in fiction, as detailed as needs be, but real, real in its social and psychological connections. Let's take coitus out of the closet and off the altar and put it on the continuum of human behavior.\\" Rabbit has an animalistic obsession with sex rather than a romanticized vision. He uses superficial criteria to pick his partners. He is taken with Ruth because she \\"feels right\\" as long as she doesn't use a \\"flying saucer\\" (a diaphragm), and even compels her to fellate him during a particularly intense bout of physical desire. He seems to use intense sex to replace what is missing from his work and life at home. His sexual prowess also supplies him with the sense of identity that his basketball playing gave him.Brenner, G.. (1966). Rabbit, Run: John Updike's Criticism of the \\"Return to Nature\\". Twentieth Century Literature, 12(1), 3‚Äì14. http://doi.org/10.2307/440472 = Religion = For Updike, the particular etiology of Rabbit's sickness can be perceived as his distance from God, illustrated by his cavalier conversations with Eccles. The existing framework of religion and ethics should support his devotion to his marriage, job, and life, but he finds it utterly unsatisfactory.Crowe, D.. (2011). YOUNG MAN ANGSTROM: IDENTITY CRISIS AND THE WORK OF LOVE IN \\"RABBIT, RUN\\". Religion & Literature, 43(1), 81‚Äì100. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/23049355 Rabbit is clearly a sinner and in some ways he is aware of that, but he still quests for some kind of religious meaning in his life, ‚ÄúWell I don't know all this about theology, but I'll tell you. I do feel, I guess that somewhere behind all this... there's something that wants me to find it!‚ÄùUpdike, John. Rabbit, Run. New York: Knopf, 1960. 107. Print. = Identity = Rabbit faces a deep-seated psychological identity crisis throughout the book. This is due somewhat to his affectionless relationship with his mother, which has at the very least given him cause to imagine matricidal and suicidal acts.Crowe, D.. (2011). YOUNG MAN ANGSTROM: IDENTITY CRISIS AND THE WORK OF LOVE IN \\"RABBIT, RUN\\". Religion & Literature, 43(1), 83. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/23049355 Rabbit hungers for something more than what he has, for a return to the golden era of his youth, for the sexual comfort of his relationship with Janice, and for a worldview that fits his tumultuous emotions. = Vision of America = Rabbit, Run is set against the background of the America of the fifties. The Eisenhower era, apart from offering tremendous consumerist possibilities, urged Americans to renegotiate themselves to the postwar reality. The cultural atmosphere of the 1950s, charged by the politics of the Cold War, thus necessitated the phenomena of self-definition at all levels and in all areas of life. Alive to the mood of inner-directedness, Updike's Rabbit considers himself ‚Äúas a person in the process of becoming‚Äù.Purohit, A. K. (2008). Updike's rabbit, run. The Explicator, 66(4), 230. doi:10.3200/EXPL.66.4.229-233 This involves his rejection of certain traditional aspects of American life in search of a satisfactory place in the world that is never really found, as the book ends with his fate uncertain. = Transience = Rabbit is always running, searching and questing for meaning. But while at times he finds himself enthralled with people, like his relationship with Ruth, his conversations with Eccles, and his initial return to his family, in the end Rabbit is dissatisfied and takes flight. Transience appears to be implicit in the character. References to other works * Previously, Updike had written a short story entitled Ace In The Hole, and to a lesser extent a poem, Ex-Basketball Player, with similar themes to Rabbit Run.Interview with John Updike at Penguin Classics * In his senior year at Harvard, Updike submitted to his writing instructor \\"Flick,\\" an early version of \\"Ace in the Hole.\\" Updike later sent \\"Flick\\" to The New Yorker where it was rejected. * Updike said that he wrote Rabbit, Run in response to Jack Kerouac's On the Road, and tried to depict \\"what happens when a young American family man goes on the road ‚Äì the people left behind get hurt.\\" * The 2002 American drama film 8 Mile draws on Rabbit, Run. Its screenplay, by Scott Silver, opens with a quote from the novel: \\"If you have the guts to be yourself...other people'll pay your price.\\"Silver, Scott: 8 Mile, screenplay, 2002. The protagonist, played by the rapper Eminem, is nicknamed B-Rabbit. The soundtrack of the film features a song titled \\"Rabbit Run\\".  Reception  Rabbit, Run established Updike as one of the major American novelists of his generation. In the New York Times he was praised for his ‚Äúartful and supple‚Äù style in his ‚Äútender and discerning study of the desperate and the hungering in our midst.‚Äùhttps://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/updike-rabbitrun.pdf American novelist Joyce Carol Oates has written that Updike is ‚Äúa master, like Flaubert, of mesmerizing us with his narrative voice even as he might repel us with the vanities of human desire his scalpel exposes.‚Äù Updike himself said Rabbit, Run was the novel most people associate him with, even though other novels in the series won Pulitzer Prizes.Arts: A Conversation with John Updike  The New York Times - YouTube Literary significance The text of the novel went through several rewrites. Knopf originally required Updike to cut some \\"sexually explicit passages,\\" but he restored and rewrote the book for the 1963 Penguin edition and again for the 1995 Everyman's omnibus edition.John Updike, \\"Introduction\\" to Updike, Rabbit Angstrom: A Tetralogy (New York: Knopf, 1995), p. ix. Though it had been done earlier, as in William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying and Albert Camus' The Fall, Updike's novel is noted as being one of several well regarded, early uses of the present tense.

It was founded in 1925 by the first registered Filipino architect, Tom√°s Map√∫a, a graduate of Cornell University. After he died, the tradition was continued by his children, √ìscar M. Map√∫a Sr., a graduate in Civil Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Gloria M. Map√∫a-Lim. The university has been granted with the Level IV Accredited status to its Civil Engineering program by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA), which is one of the first engineering programs to be accorded such status.List of Institutions with PACUCOA Accredited Programs as Certified by FAAP as of May 2010 The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has also recently recognized Map√∫a's Mechanical Engineering (ME), Computer Engineering (CpE), Civil Engineering (CE), Environmental and Sanitary Engineering (EnSE), Chemical Engineering (CHE), Electrical Engineering (EE), Information Technology (IT) and Electronics Engineering (ECE) programs as Centers of Excellence for Engineering (COE), while Industrial Engineering (IE) and Computer Science (CS) programs as a Center of Development. Map√∫a University is also the first Philippine and Southeast Asian educational institution to have ABET certification. History =Early activities= The institute was founded on January 25, 1925, by Tom√°s B. Map√∫a, a graduate of Cornell University and the first registered Filipino architect and Civil Engr. Gonzalo T. Vales. At first, the institute only provided architecture and civil engineering programs. It is the first institution in the Philippines to offer a bachelor's degree in architecture. There were 80 students and a dozen faculty members at that time; classes were held in a rented commercial building in Carriedo Street near Feati University in Quiapo, Manila. In 1928, the Map√∫a Institute of Technology Pre-Engineering High School was established in Doroteo Jose Street (now present site of Amaia Skies Tower Avenida developed by Ayala Group) through Rizal Avenue Sta. Cruz Manila. Then in 1930, Map√∫a joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association as the Map√∫a Cardinals. =World War II and after-war development= During World War II, Map√∫a's Intramuros Campus was used as a garrison by the Japanese forces during the occupation of Manila, and all classes and organisations were suspended. The Institute would continue to suffer throughout the war as the effort of the Institute to continue the studies of the students were suspended and Senior students were forced to prematurely graduate. In 1945 the Institute suffered total destruction during the liberation. As a part of the rehabilitation program, the former De Luxe Fashion School in Doroteo Jos√© was Leased Lot property for 50 years (1948-1998) and housed the high school department in 1948. In 1951, the Don Tomas B. Map√∫a family acquired a piece of land from the La Corporaci√≥n Fransicana where the present Intramuros Campus stands. The campus opened at 1956 and the building construction was completed in 1963. All college programs under deanship of Engr. Gonzalo T. Vales were transferred from the Doroteo Jos√© campus to the Intramuros Campus in 1973. Tomas B. Map√∫a died on December 22, 1965 and his son √ìscar Sr. took over the presidency until his death in 1998. It was under T√≥mas B. Map√∫a, and later his son √ìscar Sr., that the institute gained prominence as an engineering school. During this period, the institute took the top 10 and even the top 20 slots in most licensure exams for architecture and engineering. It also achieved the highest passing rates in the board exams among other competing schools in architecture and engineering. =Yuchengco administration= Tom√°s B. Map√∫a's grandson, Oscar Map√∫a Jr., took over his duties until December 1999, when the Map√∫a family sold the institute to the Yuchengco Group of Companies (YGC) headed by Alfonso T. Yuchengco and appointed Reynaldo B. Vea as president. In 2002, the old RCBC Building in Sen. Gil Puyat Ave. in Makati City was purchased and converted into the Map√∫a Makati Campus, where the School of Information Technology was moved from the Intramuros Campus. A spin-off of the School of IT, the Map√∫a IT Center, as the Makati Campus is named, was established. The MITC offers 2-year diploma programs that eventually lead into an associate degree ladderized to the bachelor's degree (4-year) IT courses of Map√∫a. Starting 2002, Map√∫a, which originally was on a semestral system, adopted the quartem system. This academic system was intended to allow students to graduate faster (e.g. the original 5-year engineering programs could be taken in four years) and to focus on less, interrelated course subjects in an 11-week term. On the other hand, Map√∫a High School was closed down on 2005, since it was operated in the red. Along with the establishment of the Malayan High School of Science and Malayan Colleges Laguna, the Administration intends to encompass all its educational institutions under the name Malayan Colleges, to be later pushed through to university status as is under the Vision 2020 initiative with Map√∫a Institute of Technology as the College of Engineering. On May 18, 2017, Map√∫a Institute of Technology has been formally granted University Status, per Commission en banc Resolution No. 379-2017, dated May 9, 2017 at the CHED Auditorium in Diliman, Quezon City. On January 8, 2018, Yuchengco Group of Companies and Ayala Corporation, through a joint press statement, has announced the possible merger of their education arms, namely Ayala Education, Inc. and iPeople, Inc, with the iPeople, Inc. being the surviving entity. It has been stated that the potential merger will be finalized in the first quarter of 2018. This brings together AEI's APEC Schools, University of Nueva Caceres, National Teachers College, and iPeople's Malayan Education System, operating under the name Map√∫a University and its subsidiaries, Malayan Colleges Laguna (MCL) and Malayan Colleges Mindanao (MCM) a combined student population of over 60,000 . On May 2, 2019, the merger between AC Education and iPeople was completed, with the Yuchengco Group of Companies owning 51.3% of iPeople and Ayala Corporation with 33.5% share of the said company. Campus Intramuros =Intramuros Campus= The Map√∫a Intramuros Campus is located within the walls of Intramuros in Manila. Accessible from the campus are malls and recreational centers such as SM City Manila behind the Manila City Hall, Robinson's Place Ermita, Harrison Plaza in Vito Cruz, Rizal Park and the Baywalk along Roxas Boulevard. The Intramuros Campus holds the Architecture, Engineering, Multimedia and Visual Arts, and Social Science programs. The campus underwent through a lot of renovation in the past and is equipped for further studies in the fields of engineering.

It stands on where the Student Pavilion used to be. *The Southeast Building serves as an extension of the South Building that directly faces the East Building. It houses the security office, the bookstore, and the admission's office. Inside the Intramuros Campus Additional Facilities: * Gymnasium: The place where Physical Education activities are held, as well as game and concert events * St. Rita's Chapel: The chapel near the North entrance of the institute. It is where masses are regularly held and extends to the east side as the Guidance's office. There are reports that Map√∫a-Intramuros will start further expanding its infrastructure at the end of its 86th Foundation Week Celebration. This expansion mainly includes the Gymnasium Area and the Juan Map√∫a Memorial Hall. = Makati Campus = MITC Building, Makati Campus The Map√∫a Information Technology Center (MITC) is located in Makati City and occupies the former RCBC building at the corner of Gil Puyat Avenue and Nicanor Garcia Street. Accessible from the campus are malls and recreational centers such as the Ayala Center. Aside from the associate degrees held by the Map√∫a IT Center, the Makati Campus hosts the Senior High School, School of Information Technology and ETY School of Business & Management. The campus is equipped with appropriate equipment to support the Information Technology programs. The Makati Campus' library is equipped with electronic resources and offers the Library Plus service by default. The Makati Campus is a building with three floors: *Ground Floor **West Wing: Prayer Room, Computer Laboratories **East Wing: MITC Facilities *Second Floor **West Wing: Faculty Rooms, Student Lounge, Cisco Lecture and Laboratory Rooms **East Wing: MITC Computer Laboratories, Cardinal Hall *Third Floor **West Wing: Library, Skills Laboratory, Lecture Rooms **East Wing: Audio Visual Rooms, Biology and Chemistry Laboratories, Lecture Rooms, Canteen Student Life Innovations * Map√∫a was the first institute in the Philippines to feature a RFID or Radio Frequency ID card system which they call \\"CARDINAL Plus\\" which stands for CARD and Integrated Network Access Log-in Plus. It is a two-piece plastic PVC card with a microchip and antenna inserted in between. The CARDINAL Plus functions not only as an identification card but acts as a Library card as well. It also has the capability to store student logs, grades, guidance records, schedules, and more. As a security measure, all students flash their cards on top of the readers at the entrance. A person will be identified easily with his photo and information appearing on the monitor. It also serves as an ATM Card. Other schools adopted the RFID identification system later on. * Map√∫a has its own SIM card, the Map√∫a Cardinal SIM which is powered by Smart Communications. The Cardinal SIM contains all the usual features of a regular Smart SIM card with the addition of the Map√∫aTXT service, which allows students to receive important school announcements and check for the remaining matriculation charges on their mobile phones. *In 2016, ABET has also accredited Map√∫a's Biological Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering‚Äîhaving a total of 13, thus holding the most number of ABET- accredited programs in a single campus in the Philippines. * The Map√∫a Robotics Team is a pioneering organization that has been granted several major projects by the Philippine Navy, the Department of Science and Technology and the Philippine National Police intending to modernize the weapons and equipment used by the Philippine government. Projects, to name a few, include the following:The New Builder Vol. 41 No. 4 Page 2, \\"Mapua Robotics Team Calls for Investors\\" **Mechanical Anti-terrorist Concept or MAC (a bomb-defusal robot now used by the PNP-Makati City) **The Project Trident Strike (a remotely operated sentry gun mounted in naval gunships and perimeter defenses) **Project Phalanx, a compact version of the Trident Strike. **MAC-2 (an improved version of the first Mechanical Anti-Terrorist Concept), will be released by the Robotics Team by February 2010. **The Philippine Electric Vehicle (electric car designed for urban mass transportation sponsored by the DOST) **The Submersible Rover (a scouting equipment for the Philippine Navy) * The institute's Civil Engineering program has received Level 4 Accredited Status from the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation PACUCOA as of January 2009, the first engineering program that has been granted this status in the Philippines. * The institute, effective on first term of AY 2011-2012, is pioneering the program Technical Communication (TechComm) under the School of Languages, Humanities and Social Sciences; the Institute is the first to offer the program in the Philippines. Malayan controversy On February 10, 2005, as a part of Map√∫a's plans for elevating the institute to university status, the administration announced the renaming of the institute to Malayan University, inspired by the name of the insurance company owned by the Yuchengcos, the Malayan Insurance Company. But while waiting to become eligible for university status, the name \\"Malayan Colleges\\" will be used and the name \\"Map√∫a Institute of Technology\\" will be retained for the College of Engineering, Architecture and IT. This move was very unpopular with the students and the alumni. On February 14, 2005, the students protested outside the campus, clad in black shirts protesting against the decision of the administration and criticized them for not consulting the students before making such a decision. This event has been called as the \\"Black Valentine\\" protest. Despite the efforts of the students, faculty and alumni against the decision, the Board of Trustees and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED Philippines) have approved the name change and will be implemented in the near future.

The airport is a technical base and focus city for Air Greenland, the flag carrier airline of Greenland, linking the capital with several towns in western and south-western part of the country, including the airline hub at Kangerlussuaq Airport. With connections to Iceland, Nuuk Airport is also one of six international airports in Greenland but serves only destinations within Greenland and Iceland. International connections are made with flights to either Keflav√≠k International Airport in Iceland or Kangerlussuaq Airport. In the early 1960s, seaplanes of the newly established Air Greenland landed in Nuuk Port. In 1965, the airline invested in developing a more robust fleet based on the large Sikorsky S-61 helicopter, which continued to serve the town for the next four decades, even after the construction of an airport in Nuuk capable of serving the short takeoff and landing (STOL) de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft, which dominated at the airport since the 1970s. The airport was constructed to serve the largest town in Greenland, yet due to space constraints at the location in a mountainous area and problems with the weather, it is unable to service large airliners or flights reaching Denmark or other countries. In connection with events are chartered aircraft or VIP flights unable to reach Nuuk. A change to a small local aircraft (normally at Kangerlussuaq Airport) is always needed. A large expansion of the airport has been controversial due to the approach near the urbanized area of the outlying districts of Nuuk, although the issue continues to be a subject of internal debate in Greenland. A new international airport is slated for completion in 2023.https://politiken.dk/indland/art7331116/Nye-lufthavne-i-Gr%C3%B8nland- bliver-realitet-i-urolig-tid History =Seaplane era= In the early 1960s, after the establishment of Air Greenland on 7 November 1960 as Gr√∏nlandsfly, Nuuk was served exclusively by the PBY Catalina flying boat, with the aircraft using the waterways of the Nuuk Port as a landing site. In 1962 a PBY Catalina crashed near the port, killing 15 people on board. =Helicopter era= The Sikorsky S-61N helicopter connected Nuuk with smaller towns for more than four decades. The tragedy was one of the factors leading to the decision to invest in a helicopter fleet. The Sikorsky S-61N machines‚Äîstill in use in 2010‚Äîproved to be a more reliable mode of transport for the city, providing exclusive service for the Nuuk city for more than a decade‚Äîfrom the purchase date in 1965 until the late 1970s. Even in the later era of the fixed-wing, turboprop plane domination, the S-61N helicopters continued to link Nuuk with the smaller town of Paamiut, until the airport was built there in 2007, replacing the old heliport. =Regional airport network= Nuuk Airport was built in 1979, when the then newly formed home rule government decided to create a network of the STOL-capable domestic airports. The airport in the largest city in Greenland was a priority for the government, followed by Kulusuk Airport in Kulusuk in south-eastern Greenland, and Ilulissat Airport in Ilulissat, the largest town in the Disko Bay region of western Greenland. This constituted the first such wave of network expansion. =Network expansion= It was not until the 1990s that the network experienced another spurt of large-scale growth, when the airports in the remaining larger towns were built: Sisimiut Airport in Sisimiut and Maniitsoq Airport in Maniitsoq in central-western Greenland, Aasiaat Airport in the Disko Bay region, Upernavik Airport in Upernavik in northwestern Greenland, and Qaarsut Airport, an airport in Qaarsut, a settlement in the Uummannaq Fjord region; the airport serving both the village and the larger town of Uummannaq, located on the rocky Uummannaq Island. =2000-onwards= The terminal at Nuuk Airport. The first international flights from Nuuk Airport were to Iqaluit in Nunavut, Canada. This connection was closed 13 years later, and for years afterwards international flights to Greenland were limited to Kangerlussuaq Airport in central western Greenland, to the north of Nuuk, an airport inherited from the U.S. Air Force when the former Sondrestrom Air Base was handed over to the then home rule government on 30 September 1992. Two Dash-8 200Q aircraft at Nuuk Airport With the airport being limited to serving small planes, the possibilities for international connections remain limited. Reopening of the connection to Iqaluit Airport was considered by Air Greenland in late 2009, but was later postponed until at least 2011. In order to compete with Air Iceland, which operates services to Nuuk, Narsarsuaq, Ilulissat, and all airports on the eastern coast, Air Greenland announced opening of new connections with Iceland, linking Nuuk and Narsarsuaq with Keflav√≠k International Airport, later restricting it to Nuuk. Air Greenland's seasonal flights to Iqaluit in Canada finally resumed in summer 2012, but ended before summer 2015. \\"Amaalik\\" undergoes open-air maintenance at the airport The Bombardier Dash 8-Q200 turboprops, acquired in Spring 2010, are the newest planes in the Air Greenland fleet, and are based at the airport. Nuuk Airport is also home to the Beechcraft King Air B200 \\"Amaalik\\", used for air ambulance flights and occasional charters. The airport is also used for various charter flights, such as airlifts to the summit of the Sermitsiaq Mountain, a landmark of Nuuk, located on Sermitsiaq Island north of the airport. The airport is also used for shuttle flights for events like the 2010 Inuit Circumpolar Council general assembly in Nuuk. and for the 2016 Arctic Winter Games. In general the short runway is a problem for large events in Nuuk. Charter and extra flights from outside Greenland can not land in Nuuk (or any other city of Greenland), so Air Greenland need to shuttle passengers between Kangerlussuaq and Nuuk, using planes much smaller than the charter planes, often requiring a hotel night in Kangerlussuaq.Stor tilfredshed med indsatsen i forbindelse med Arctic Winter Games (17 March 2016, in Danish) =Runway expansion= Nuuk airport has one asphalt runway (05/23) above sea level. The airport terminal and apron are built on a levelled platform on an undulating slope under the Quassussuaq mountain, with the runway platform artificially elevated to compensate for the scarp immediately to the west. The runway platform bed is composed of broken rock and rubble, topped with gravel, and protected by a low, wooden fence. The landscape beyond the northern end of the runway. There is little room for expansion there, so most of the expansion is beyond the southern end. Undercarriage deployed during approach over Nuup Kangerlua. It is here between Sermitsiaq and the airport that the aircraft was seriously threatened by air vent turbulence, which would be hard to avoid for a large airliner, unlike the highly maneuverable Dash-7s. There is an ongoing extension project for the runway. After 2010 there are no aircraft that can be purchased, which have more than 30 seats and can use short runways like Nuuk. When the existing Dash-8 200 retire or more aircraft are needed, a longer runway is necessary. The northern end of the runway is less than from the shore of Nuup Kangerlua fjord. An expansion of the runway in that direction would require relocation of the connecting road, which climbs under the runway scarp. An often-discussed extension of the runway in the other direction would have brought the endpoint close to Qinngorput, the newest district of Nuuk, rapidly expanding in the late 2000s. Also an expansion should not obstruct ongoing traffic since there is no other runway or airport reachable by road. Suggestions were extend it from to , to , or (the longest possible) the latter which would allow direct flights to Denmark, but only with medium-size jet aircraft such as the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 instead of the large Airbus A330 used at present. As a result, more flights are needed. The extension issue has been a long-standing topic of ongoing controversy in Greenland. Rough weather in the region is cited as life-threatening to larger airplanes, given the additional difficulty of approach in a mountainous region. Another suggested alternative was to build a new airport on one of the islands of Angisunnguaq or Qeqertarssuaq, locations having less turbulence, and allowing runway needed for the large planes used today to Denmark. These are located a few kilometres south of Nuuk and would need a bridge or tunnel connection. Such a project could cost somewhere around 2‚Äì3 billion DKK.Placering af central atlantlufthavn (Danish) A decision has been made to extend the runway to . In 2016 the state-owned company Kalaallit Airports A/S was formed. It shall build or rebuild (extend) the airports in Nuuk, Ilulissat and Qaqortoq, and thereafter own them. Construction start was november 2019. The time plan, which has the aim to keep traffic going, is to build the southern extension until July 2021, use it for air activities and to build the rest of the new runway and finish the project in August 2023. =Greenland hub= Unlike Nuuk Airport, the airport in Kangerlussuaq can serve large airliners, and remains the airline hub of Air Greenland, the flag carrier of Greenland. But Kangerlussuaq has very few inhabitants and is mainly a place to change plane. A move to Nuuk would eliminate the plane change for many travellers, but would require a runway expansion to around . The airline is opposed to relocation of its hub, citing the costs of such a move and consistently favourable weather conditions at Kangerlussuaq, located deep inland, about from the edge of the Greenland ice sheet (). The airline argues that the infrastructure at Kangerlussuaq is good, and visibility is not hampered by the coastal fogs, storms, heavy snowfall, and frequent turbulence in particular. Another option mentioned is to have Keflavik, Iceland as the international hub, close Kangerlussuaq, and expand Nuuk Airport runway slightly, so small jet planes can use it. (Air Iceland has already built up a Greenland network from Reykjav√≠k, Iceland) These well-grounded arguments for preserving the status quo pose a problem for the Government of Greenland, which oversees the development of the airport network through Mittarfeqarfiit, the airport administration authority. More than a quarter of Greenland's population lives in Nuuk, with the majority of the important institutions in the country located in the city, and the need to change planes at Kangerlussuaq is costly and time-consuming for passengers, especially for groups using larger long-distance charter planes. The final destination of most travellers to Greenland is Nuuk, and for them it does not help that Kangerlussuaq has better weather. They could equally well wait for better Nuuk weather in Copenhagen or Iceland. Geography Runway scarp and fence The airport is located northeast of Nuuk Centrum. The former suburbs of Nuuk, such as Nuussuaq, Quassussuup Tungaa, and Qinngorput, incorporated into the town in the last decade, have brought the city closer to the airport. As of 2010 the airport is within walking distance of the nearest continuously inhabited area, its runway approximately from the University of Greenland campus. There is an alpine ski course only from the airport terminal. Airlines and destinations Air Greenland has its technical base at Nuuk Airport (hangars pictured). Facilities Nuuk Airport has a passenger terminal, and a cargo terminal of Air Greenland. It serves as the technical base for Air Greenland. The airport is equipped with the distance measuring equipment. =Terminal= Air Greenland check-in desk at the terminal There are three gates in the terminal, located in the same area as the check-in desks and the waiting hall, with unrestricted access. The luggage conveyor belt is installed in a separate section of the terminal. The airport is closed on Sundays. =Ground transport= Line 3 of Nuup Bussii connects the airport with Nuuk Centrum, passing through the Nuussuaq and Quassussuup Tungaa districts on the way. Buses depart from the airport every hour during rush hours Monday to Friday. Taxis operated by Nuna Taxa are also available. Limited-time parking for private cars is available outside the terminal. Accidents and incidents *In 1973 a Sikorsky S-61N helicopter operated by Gr√∏nlandsfly crashed in waters about south of Nuuk, due to possible main rotor failure. 15 people were killed, all on board, including passengers. *On 7 June 2008, a Eurocopter AS350 operated by Air Greenland crashed on the runway at Nuuk Airport. There were no injuries, but the helicopter was damaged beyond repair. *On 4 March 2011, an Air Iceland Dash 8's landing gear collapsed while landing on the runway. There were no injuries, but the aircraft suffered serious damage.

Skidby Windmill is surrounded by fertile agricultural land typical of the East Riding Part of the parish is to the east of the village and A164 beyond the Wolds, and north of Cottingham, extending as far as the Hull to Bridlington railway line at its easternmost extent, the land height drops to the east reaching a low of less than 10m near the railway line.Ordnance survey. 1:25000. 2006 The part of the parish east of the A164 includes a golf course 'Skidby Lakes Golf course' and associated leisure club,, Skidby Lakes Golf Club as well as a major (400/275 kV AC) electricity substation \\"Creyke Beck\\",, Creyke Beck electricity substationCreyke Beck is usually associated by address with Cottingham, not Skidby, being much closer and being accessible via Cottingham not Skidby The remainder of the low-lying area is agricultural. Most of the parish area is west of the A164, within the wolds: Hessle Golf Club is north of the Eppleworth to Raywell road (Westfield Road), There is a traveller's site at a former chalk quarry near Eppleworth;Sources: * *, Traveller site, former Chalk pit, Westfield Road. and a waste composting facility near the former Albion Mill on the route of the former Hull and Barnsley line,Sources: * *, Waste management site (composting) expanded to include an in-vessel composting facility in 2015, used to process organic waste from East Riding of Yorkshire Council and Hull City Council. The remainder of the area is in agricultural use. In the 2011 UK census, Skidby parish had a population of 1,284, a fall from the 2001 UK census figure of 1,369. =Skidby village= Skidby has a single main street, Main Street, running roughly east‚Äìwest: the eastern end leads to Cottingham, making a crossroads with the former Hessle to Beverley turnpike before a roundabout junction with the A164 road. At the western end of the village Little Weighton Road leads roughly towards Little Weighton; to the south is Riplingham Road, also leading westward, currently (2006) a farm track and footpath.Ordnance Survey. 1:10560. 1856 History St Michael's Church, Skidby The village's name is thought mean dwelling (-b√Ω) of a person called Sk√≠tr, (\\"Skyti's farm\\") the words are of Scandinavian origin.Sources: * * An alternative origin meaning 'firewood place' (from ski√∞ and by), an origin from the person's name ski√∞i has also been suggested. Other alternatives are 'dirty place', from the old English scite. The village name 'Skidby' is first recorded by Oswald, Archbishop of York in the 10th century, as Scyteby: the bishop Oscytel was recorded as having acquired it for ¬£20. In the Doomsday Book it is referred to as Schitebi ‚Äì at the time of the survey it was recorded together with 'Burtone' (near Bishop Burton): the land belonged to the manor of Beverley (in the hands of the church), with over 20 villains and 3 knights. The forms Skipbie, and Skitby were in use in the 16th century, in the 19th century 'Skitby' was a common form,Sources: * * as was the current form Skidby. The church of St Michael dates to 1777, with a tower built in 1827. The church was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1968. Weslyan and Baptist chapels were built in the early 1800s, and a school and teacher's house built in 1849. A cornmill, Skidby Mill was constructed in 1821, raised in the 1870s and listed in 1952. By the 1850s the village population had reached 306; in 1857 the ecclesiastical parish of Skidby became fully separated from Cottingham and received a resident clergyman. Around 1885 the Hull and Barnsley Railway was constructed (section closed 1960s), running north-east through the parish: no stations were constructed on the section near Skidby; at the point the railway crossed the Eppleworth valley a five arched brick viaduct was constructed, known locally as 'five arches', or as 'Eppleworth viaduct'., Eppleworth viaduct (demolished) North-west of the viaduct the line required a cutting, known as the Little Weighton Cutting. In 1972 of land north of the Eppleworth to Raywell road was acquired for the Hessle Golf Club, which was relocating due to the construction of the Humber Bridge; the nine-hole course was opened in 1975., Hessle Golf Club course A traveller's site was established on Westfield Road in a disused chalk pit in the 1980s.

They are classified as: family heirlooms, commercial heirlooms, mystery heirlooms, or created heirlooms. They usually have a shorter shelf life and less disease resistance than hybrids. They are grown for a variety of reasons: for food, historical interest, access to wider varieties, and by people who wish to save seeds from year to year, as well as for their taste.  Taste  Many heirloom tomatoes are sweeter and lack a genetic mutation that gives tomatoes a uniform red color at the cost of the fruit's taste. Varieties bearing this mutation, which have been favored by industry since the 1940s, feature fruits with lower levels of carotenoids and a decreased ability to make sugar within the fruit. Cultivars alt=Tomatoes of various sizes and colors, including Snow White Cherry Red Currant God Love Ida Gold Matt's Wild Cherry Black Cherry Garden Peach Black Krim Brandywine (red) Early Girl Variegated Brandywine Yellow Aunt Ruby's German Green Green Zebra Heirloom tomato cultivars can be found in a wide variety of colors, shapes, flavors and sizes. Some heirloom cultivars can be prone to cracking or lack of disease resistance. As with most garden plants, cultivars can be acclimated over several gardening seasons to thrive in a geographical location through careful selection and seed saving. Some of the most famous examples include Aunt Ruby's German Green, Bananna Legs, Big Rainbow, Black Krim, Brandywine, Cherokee Purple, Chocolate Cherry, Costoluto Genovese, Garden Peach, Gardener's Delight, Green Zebra, Hawaiian Pineapple, Hillbilly, Lollypop, Marglobe, Matt's Wild Cherry, Mortgage Lifter, Mr. Stripey, Neville Tomatoes, Paul Robeson, Pruden's Purple, Red Currant, San Marzano, Silvery Fir Tree, Three Sisters, and Yellow Pear. Seed collecting Heirloom seeds \\"breed true,\\" unlike the seeds of hybridized plants. Both sides of the DNA in an heirloom variety come from a common stable cultivar. Heirloom tomato varieties are \\"open pollinating\\", and cross-pollination is common without human intervention. Heirloom seeds can be easily collected and usually almost all seeds will continue to show the traits of the original seed because this family of tomatoes almost always self-pollinates. Dramatic cross- pollination may occur in the presence of pollinating insects during flowering. Collecting heirloom seed is as easy as picking ripe tomatoes, chopping or mashing into a jar till less than half-full, filling with water, shaking from time to time and allowing to decompose for 1‚Äì6 days until seeds sink to the bottom, then rinsing until the seeds are clean, and drying. This decomposition is beneficial because it discourages transmission of diseases to the seed, the drying promotes better germination, and because the seeds are easier to separate when they are clean.

It is one of two species of wild strawberry that were hybridized to create the modern domesticated strawberry (Fragaria √ó ananassa). Subspecies There are four recognized subspecies: :*Fragaria virginiana subsp. glauca (formerly known as F. ovalis) :*Fragaria virginiana subsp. grayana :*Fragaria virginiana subsp. platypetala :*Fragaria virginiana subsp. virginiana Cytology Fragaria virginiana var. platypetala usually has dense and spreading pubescence on flower and leaf stalks as illustrated by this individual. The fruit is a reddish, fleshy aggregate dotted with \\"seeds\\" (achenes) up to 1 cm. All strawberries have a base haploid count of 7 chromosomes. Fragaria virginiana is octoploid, having eight sets of these chromosomes for a total of 56. These eight genomes pair as four distinct sets, of two different types, with little or no pairing between sets. The genome composition of the octoploid strawberry species has generally been indicated as AAA'A'BBB'B'. The A-type genomes were likely contributed by diploid ancestors related to Fragaria vesca or similar species, while the B-type genomes seem to descend from a close relative of Fragaria iinumae. The exact process of hybridization and speciation which resulted in the octoploid species is still unknown, but it appears that the genome compositions of both Fragaria chiloensis and Fragaria virginiana (and by extension the cultivated octoploid strawberry as well) are identical. Description Fragaria virginiana can grow up to 4 inches tall. The plant typically bears numerous trifoliate leaves that are green on top, pale green on the lower surface. Each leaflet is about 3 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. The leaflet is oval shaped and has coarse teeth along the edge except near the bottom. This plant has a five-petaled white flower with numerous pistils, surrounded by yellow-anthered stamens. There are ten small green sepals under the petals. The seeds of this plant are developed from the pistils in the centre of the flower which will become dark-coloured fruit (achenes) on the strawberry.Wendy Deng and Charlie Marshall, Characteristic point, \\"Fragaria virginiana (Wild Strawberry) Rosaceae\\", Retrieved 28 March 2018. The fruit of the wild strawberry is smaller than that of the garden strawberry (Fragaria √ó ananassa). Botanically, the fruit is classified as an aggregate accessory fruit, but it is commonly called a berry. A study showed that F. virginiana can reproduce asexually and sexually.Wilk, J., A. T. Kramer and M. V. Ashley. 2009. High variation in clonal vs. sexual reproduction in populations of the wild strawberry, Fragaria virginiana Mill. (Rosaceae). Annals of Botany 114: 1413-1419. Taxonomy Fragaria virginiana Mill. is considered to be the valid name for this plant by a number of authorities (and was described by Philip Miller in 1768 in the eighth edition of The Gardeners Dictionary). According to the International Plant Names Index the name, Fragaria virginiana Duchesne, published by Antoine Nicolas Duchesne in 1766, is an invalid name. However, other authorities consider the valid name to be Fragaria virginiana Duchesne.

Though vastly outnumbered, the Moroccan forces under Judar Pasha defeated the Songhai Askia Ishaq II, guaranteeing the Empire's downfall. Background The Songhai had been the dominant force in Western Africa for more than a century, controlling the Western Sudan from the headwaters of the Senegal River to what is now Niger; however, a rivalry for succession after the 1583 death of Askia Daoud left the Empire in a weakened state. Meanwhile, to the north, the Saadi Dynasty of Morocco was at the height of its power. In 1578, Morocco successfully repelled an attempt by Portugal to conquer it at the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir, where its forces decimated a large Portuguese army. However, the expense of paying for the defenses used to hold off the Portuguese was a large strain on Morocco. The nation's coffers were depleted, and Morocco was on the verge of bankruptcy. In search of new resources for his kingdom, Sultan Ahmad I al-Mansur Saadi turned his attention to the Songhai Empire, where he erroneously believed the gold mines from which its wealth came, were located. Desert crossing Though many of his advisors warned that it was illegal to wage war against another Muslim nation, he swept their objections aside. In October 1590, he dispatched a force of 1,500 light cavalry and 2,500 infantry, many of whom were equipped with arquebuses. The command he entrusted to Judar Pasha, a Spanish eunuch who had been captured as a child. The army traveled with a transport train of 8,000 camels, 1,000 packhorses, 1,000 stablemen, and 600 laborers; they also transported eight English cannons. After a four-month journey, Judar reached Songhai territory with his forces largely intact. His forces captured, plundered, and razed the salt mines at Taghaza. The Moroccans then advanced on the Songhai capital of Gao. Battle On 13 March 1591, the armies met. From Taghaza, the Moroccan army marched towards Gao. The Songhai army awaited Judar's force near Tondibi, a cattle pasture just north of Gao. Though the Songhai had a powerful cavalry, they lacked the Moroccan's gunpowder weapons, which would turn the tide of the battle. The Songhai battle strategy was poorly thought out, as the plan to send a stampede of 1,000 cattle to break down the Moroccan lines and to cover their infantry (who lacked the technology of gunpowder weapons) failed, with the cattle charge being repelled by the noise of gunfire and the sound of cannons, which caused the cattle to stampede back towards Songhai lines. The Songhai infantry continued to pursue the Moroccan army as planned but they were slaughtered by Moroccan arquebuses. The Songhai army then sent their cavalry to charge at the Moroccan lines. After an initial cavalry skirmish, Judar maneuvered his arquebusiers into place and opened fire with both arquebuses and cannons. The remaining Songhai cavalry fled the field or were massacred by Moroccan gunfire. At last only the rearguard, a unit of brave and resolute men remained, facing the Moroccans who they fought in hand-to-hand combat until they were killed. Consequences Judar Pasha continued onto Gao and sacked the city, whose residents had already evacuated,UNESCO General History of Africa, Vol. V., pg. 303 but finding little in the way of riches soon moved on to the richer trading centers of Timbuktu and Djenn√©. The looting of the three cities marked the end of the Songhai Empire as an effective force in the region; however, Morocco proved likewise unable to assert a firm control over the area due to the vastness of the Songhai Empire and difficulties of communication and resupply across the Saharan trade routes, and a decade of sporadic fighting began. The area eventually splintered into dozens of smaller kingdoms, and the Songhai themselves established the Dendi Kingdom. There were also domestic troubles and when, in 1603, the sultan died (presumably by the plague which swept through Morocco at the time, or at the hands of one of his sons according to some) a war of succession broke out. Soon all that was left of his legacy was Marrakesh, local warlords, the Portuguese and the Spanish having taken over the rest.

Shadows, is an American singer and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist, songwriter, and a founding member of American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold. In 2017, Shadows was voted third in the list of Top 25 Greatest Modern Frontmen by Ultimate Guitar. Early life M. Shadows was born Matthew Charles Sanders on July 31, 1981 in Fountain Valley, California and raised in Huntington Beach, California. His interest in rock was from listening to bands like Guns N' Roses earlier in life after his father gave him his first cassette, and his interest in heavy metal music grew as he became older and began to play the guitar. He links his early musical experience with the piano as a major factor in developing his skills with the guitar and his voice. He attended Huntington Beach High School, where he played for a brief stint in a punk band named \\"Successful Failure\\". Following this, Shadows formed Avenged Sevenfold in 1999 along with middle school friends Zacky Vengeance, The Rev, and Matt Wendt. Stage name Shadows, like the other members of Avenged Sevenfold, uses a stage name. In an interview, Shadows says that he chose his stage name because he thought of himself as \\"the darker character in the group\\". The 'M' is in place of his first name, Matthew, which he did not want to be in his stage name because of the way it sounded. He also added that he and the band took stage names because many other successful musicians that they were influenced by had them (e.g. Slash of Guns N' Roses, Munky of Korn and the members of Slipknot). Shadows also mentioned in another interview their reasoning behind choosing stage names also came from their intention to \\"annoy\\" people. Vocal style Shadows performing at the 236x236px Shadows possesses a baritone voice. His vocal style has evolved significantly over the years. On the band's first full- length record, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, he featured harsh, metalcore- style growls with limited instances of clean vocals. The release of Waking the Fallen in 2003 demonstrated his progression towards melodic vocal lines, but still retained a strong screaming influence. However, the most significant change came with the release of the band's major label debut, City of Evil, in 2005, which featured minimal background screaming, stronger vocal melodies, and increased emphasis on harmonies and melodic hooks. Shadows turned to Ron Anderson, a vocal coach that had previously worked with Axl Rose and Chris Cornell. Shadows was specifically looking to add a more gritty, raspy tone to his voice and worked with Anderson for several months on this before City of Evil was recorded. This change resulted in newly established vocal contributions from each band member during live performances, and remained prevalent on every record the band has released since 2005. Rumors were spread that Shadows had lost his ability to scream due to throat surgery needed after Warped Tour 2003. However, producer Andrew Murdock put down these rumors by saying: \\"When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet‚Ä¶ Matt handed me the CD, and he said to me, 'This record's screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming and half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore‚Ä¶ the record after that is going to be all singing.'\\" During an interview with Stevie Rennie on October 28, 2014, Shadows mentioned that he on purpose had changed his voice to become less raspy and distorted while touring in 2014. The change was due to longer live shows lasting from one and a half to two hours in support of Hail to the King. Shadows went on to say that \\"you better be taking care of yourself or you're gonna be cancelling shows\\" and \\"I wanted to hit notes over the rasps\\". Other projects Shadows in August 2007 Shadows has made guest appearances on numerous albums by various artists. He is featured on the Steel Panther album Feel the Steel and sings a verse of \\"Turn out the Lights.\\" He also produced The Confession's 2007 album, Requiem, which, according to an interview, M. Shadows was one of the first steps which led to Avenged Sevenfold self-producing their 2007 self-titled album. Shadows also sings In \\"The River\\" by Good Charlotte on the album Good Morning Revival along with fellow band member Synyster Gates with his guitar solo. In 2012 Shadows and fellow Avenged Sevenfold member Synyster Gates made a brief cameo in the war game Call of Duty: Black Ops II in which they provided the voice over and motion capture of themselves. Also, in June 2013, Matt competed in the sold out 128-team Call of Duty bracket at MLG Anaheim, placing in the Top 48. The April 2013 release of the band Device's self-titled album featured his vocals throughout track 9, \\"Haze\\". Shadows also sang \\"Nothing to Say\\" in Slash's self-titled solo album, as well as \\"Go Alone\\" in Hell or Highwater's debut album. He was also featured on Fozzy's album Sin and Bones singing alongside Chris Jericho in the song \\"Sandpaper\\". Shadows has also been longtime friends with David Vonderhaar of Treyarch, the developers of the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, for which Avenged Sevenfold have created four original songs for. In July 2019, Shadows was added as a playable character in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4s \\"Blackout\\" battle royale mode.https://avengedsevenfold.com/news/m-shadows-playable-character-call-of- duty-black-ops-4-operation-apocalypse-z/ Personal life Shadows is of Irish and Italian descent and was raised Roman Catholic. His sister is WNBA player Amy Sanders, who is two years younger than he is. Shadows married Valary DiBenedetto on October 17, 2009. The couple have two sons, River who was born in 2012 and Cash, born in 2014. Shadows' bandmate Synyster Gates is married to DiBenedetto's twin sister Michelle DiBenedetto, which makes them brothers-in- law.https://www.pressreader.com/uk/metal-hammer-uk/20170801/281496456281720 In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Shadows published an op-ed piece for Revolver announcing his support for the Black Lives Matter movement. In it, he urged both the rock and metal communities to \\"reach out and show the compassion that I know is in us all to help raise up our fellow humans\\". He was especially motivated to write the piece due to the lack of African Americans in the Avenged Sevenfold fanbase.

It is a migratory species that breeds mainly on small islands in Bass Strait and Tasmania and migrates to the Northern Hemisphere for the boreal summer. Adult near Burrow on Bruny Island. The photograph was taken at night. Fledgling, Austins Ferry, Tasmania, Australia This shearwater appears to be related to the sooty and great shearwaters, which are also blunt-tailed, black-billed species, but its precise relationships are obscure (Austin, 1996; Austin et al., 2004). These are among the larger species of shearwater, which have been moved to a separate genus, Ardenna based on a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Penhallurick & Wink, 2004). Each parent feeds the single chick for 2‚Äì3 days and then leaves for up to three weeks in search of food. These foraging trips can cover a distance of 1,500 km (930 mi) and mean the chick may be left unattended for over a week. When the chicks fledge they weigh around 900 g (2 lb), and may be heavier than their parents. In Tasmania, and especially on the muttonbird islands of the Furneaux Group, the chicks are harvested at this time for food and oil. The largest population in the world (2.8 million pairs - about 12% of the species) seems to be located on Babel Island.

Each austral winter, the shearwaters migrate to the seas off the Aleutian Islands and Kamchatka. In the austral spring, they travel down the coast of California before crossing the Pacific back to Australia. Harvest The name \\"muttonbird\\" was first used by the early settlers on Norfolk Island, who each year harvested adult Providence petrels (Pterodroma solandri) for food. The petrels were similar to, but larger than the short-tailed shearwater. An officer in the Royal Marines called them \\"the flying sheep\\". Tasmanian Aborigines have harvested muttonbirds and their eggs for many generations, and a number of families continue this important cultural practice. The muttonbird is one of the few Australian native birds that is commercially harvested. During the muttonbird season, chicks are taken for their feathers, flesh, and oil. The industry was established by early European sealers and their Aboriginal families. The recreational harvesting of short-tailed shearwaters is limited to the open season that is declared each year. A muttonbird licence must be obtained. References *Austin, Jeremy J. (1996): Molecular Phylogenetics of Puffinus Shearwaters: Preliminary Evidence from Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene Sequences.

Born as Diego de Guevara in Cuevas del Almanzora (Crown of Castile), JudarWhile Judar is the common spelling, this is based on an assumed pronunciation by French translators of the Arabic texts Tarikh al-Sudan and Tarikh al-fattash which do not give the vowels. The name is pronounced Jawdar in the Tadhkirat an-Nisian and in the most recent English translation of the Tarikh al-Sudan by J. O. Hunwick (cited below). had been captured by Muslim slave-raiders as a young boy. His captors castrated him. As a young boy, he joined the service of Moroccan Sultan Ahmad I al-Mansur Saadi, who had many other eunuch officers. Judar was often described by reference to his blue eyes.  Battles  In 1590, Ahmad I made Judar a pasha and appointed him the head of an invasion force against the Songhai Empire of what is now Mali. In October of that year, Judar set out from Marrakesh with a force of 1,500 light cavalry and 2,500 arquebusiers and light infantry. Some of these men were Spaniards from Andalusia and some were \\"Renegats\\" (probably Christians from Southern Europe). He also carried eight English cannons in his supply train, and assembled eighty Christian bodyguards for his personal detail. After an arduous crossing of the Sahara desert, Judar razed the desert salt mines of Taghaza and advanced on the Songhai capital of Gao. Meanwhile, Songhai ruler Askia Ishaq II assembled a force of more than 40,000 men and moved north against the Moroccans; the two armies met at Tondibi in March 1591. Despite their far inferior numbers, the Moroccan gunpowder weapons easily carried the day, resulting in a rout of the Songhai troops. Judar sacked Gao and then moved on to the trading centers of Djenn√© and Timbuktu.John Coleman DeGraft- Johnson, African Glory: The Story of Vanished Negro Civilizations, Black Classic Press, London, 1954, , pp. 113-116 He reached Timbuktu in April 1591, carrying a letter from the Sultan al-Mansur demanding their cooperation.  Aftermath  According to Martin Meredith, \\"To quell resistance in Timbuktu, the Moroccans sent leading scholars to Marrakesh in chains. The wealth of Timbuktu, Gao, and Jenne was also stripped. Huge quantities of gold dust were shipped across the desert. When Judar Pasha returned to Morocco in 1599, his caravan included thirty camel-loads of gold valued by an English merchant at ¬£600,000.\\" Judar was demoted to governor because he advocated for making Timbuktu the new capital, rather than Gao, as Sultan al-Mansur's wished. Despite Judar's gains, sporadic battles continued with the Songhai army, leading to his replacement several years after his victory.  Death  Judar was executed in December 1606 on the orders of Mulay Abd Allah, son of Mullay al-Shaykh, in the course of struggles over the Moroccan throne. This was mainly set up by the Battle of Tondibi.

The community came into prominence during the 18th century when the heirs of Peshwa from the Bhat family of Balaji Vishwanath became the de facto rulers of the Maratha empire. Under the British Raj, they were the one of the Hindu communities in Maharashtra to flock to western education and they provided the bulk of social reformers, educationalists and nationalists of the late 19th century. Until the 18th century, the Chitpavans were held in low esteem by the Deshastha, the older established Brahmin community of Maharashtra region. The upper castes, that is, Marathi Brahmins, Prabhus (CKPs and Pathare Prabhus) and Saraswat Brahmins were only about 4% of the population in Maharashtra. A majority of this 4% were Brahmins. As per the 1901 census, about 5% of the Pune population was Brahmin and about 27% of them were Chitpawans.  Origin  The Chitpavan are also known as Konkanastha Brahmin. They have two common mythological stories of origin, of which the more contemporary story is based on the etymology of their name, meaning \\"pure of mind\\", while an older belief uses the alternate etymological meaning : \\"pure from the pyre\\" and is based on the tale of Parashurama in the Sahyadrikhanda of the Skanda Purana. The Parashurama mythological story of shipwrecked people is similar to the mythological story of the Bene Israel Jews of Raigad district. The history of Bene Israel, who also settled in Konkan, claims that the Chitpavans are also of Jewish origin. In addition, Indian scholar Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar has shown similarity between names of Chitpawans and the geographical sites in Palestine. A modern scholar on caste and sociology mentions another indication of them having non-Brahmin or non-Dvija origin by quoting a paper on the Veerasaivas debate and a successful argument made by Viroopaksha Pandita during Shastrartha. This was regarding Brahmin purity and was cited in Nanjundaradhya(1969). The Konkan region witnessed the immigration of groups, such as the Bene Israel, and Kudaldeshkars. Each of these settled in distinct parts of the region and there was little mingling between them. The Chitpavans were apparently the last major community to arrive there and consequently the area in which they settled, around Ratnagiri, was the least fertile and had few good ports for trading. The other groups generally took up trade as their primary occupation. In ancient times, the Chitpawans were employed as messengers and spies. Later, with the rise of the Chitpawan Peshwa in the 18th century they began migrating to Pune and found employment as military men, diplomats and clerks in the administration. A 1763-4 document shows that at least 67% of the clerks at the time were Chitpawans.  History  = Rise during the Maratha rule = Peshwa right Very little is known of the Chitpavans before 1707 A.D. Around this time, Balaji Vishwanth Bhat, a Chitpavan arrived from Ratnagiri to the Pune-Satara area. He was brought there on the basis of his reputation of being an efficient administrator. He quickly gained the attention of Chhatrapati Shahu. Balaji's work so pleased the Chhatrapati that he was appointed the Peshwa or Prime Minister in 1713. He ran a well-organized administration and, by the time of his death in 1720, he had laid the groundwork for the expansion of the Maratha Empire. Since this time until the fall of the Maratha Empire, the seat of the Peshwa would be held by the members of the Bhat family.Gokhale, B.G., 1985. The religious complex in eighteenth-century Poona. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 105(4), pp.719-724. With the ascension of Balaji Baji Rao and his family to the supreme authority of the Maratha Empire, Chitpavan immigrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune where the Peshwa offered all important offices to his fellow castemen. The Chitpavan kin were rewarded with tax relief and grants of land. Historians cite nepotismShejwalkar, T.S. (1947) The Surat Episode of 1759 Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, Vol. 8; page 182. and corruption as causes of the fall of the Maratha Empire in 1818. Richard Maxwell Eaton states that this rise of the Chitpavans is a classic example of social rank rising with political fortune. = Role in Indian politics = right After the fall of the Maratha Empire in 1818, the Chitpavans lost their political dominance to the British. The British would not subsidise the Chitpavans on the same scale that their caste-fellow, the Peshwas, had done in the past. Pay and power was now significantly reduced. Poorer Chitpavan students adapted and started learning English because of better opportunities in the British administration. Some of the prominent figures in the Hindu reform movements of the 19th and 20th centuries came from the Chitpavan Brahmin community. These included Dhondo Keshav Karve, Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Vinoba Bhave. Some of the strongest resistance to change came from the very same community. The vanguard and the old guard clashed many times. D. K. Karve was ostracised. Even Tilak offered penance for breaking caste or religious rules. One was for taking tea at Poona Christian mission in 1892 and the second was going to England in 1919. The Chitpavan community includes two major politicians in the Gandhian tradition: Gopal Krishna Gokhale, whom Gandhi acknowledged as a preceptor, and Vinoba Bhave, one of his outstanding disciples. Gandhi describes Bhave as the \\"jewel of his disciples\\", and recognised Gokhale as his political guru. However, strong opposition to Gandhi came from the Chitpavan community. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the founder of the Hindu nationalist political ideology Hindutva, was a Chitpavan Brahmin and several other Chitpavans were among the first to embrace it because they thought it was a logical extension of the legacy of the Peshwas and caste- fellow Tilak. These Chitpavans felt out of place with the Indian social reform movement of Phule and the mass politics of Gandhi. Large numbers of the community looked to Savarkar, the Hindu Mahasabha and finally the RSS. , drew their inspiration from fringe groups in this reactionary trend. =Anti- Brahmin violence in the 20th century after Gandhi's assassination= After Gandhi's assassination by Nathuram Godse, a Chitpawan, Brahmins in Maharashtra, became targets of violence, mostly by members from the Maratha caste. The motivating factor for the violence was not love for Gandhi on the part of the rioters but the denigration and humiliation that the Marathas were subjected to due to their caste status. In the Patwardhan princely states such as Sangli, the Marathas were joined by the Jains and the Lingayats in the attacks against the Brahmins. Here, specifically, advanced factories owned by the Chitpawans were destroyed. This event led to the hasty integration of the Patwardhan states into the Bombay Province by March 1948 - a move that was opposed by other Brahmins as they feared the Maratha predominance in the integrated province. During the early 20th century, the ruler of Kolhapur state, Shahu and Bal Gangadhar Tilak fell out with each other due to vedokta controversy. He was also instrumental in shaping anti-Brahmin attitude in the non-Brahmin communities during that period. This led to great violence against Brahmins in Kolhapur.  Military  The Chitpavans have considered themselves to be both warriors and priests. Their involvement in military affairs began with the rise of the Peshwas and their willingness to enter military and other services earned them high status and power in the Deccan.  Culture  In their original home of Konkan, their primary occupation was farming and some earned money by performing rituals among their own caste members. Anthropologist Donald Kurtz writes that the late 20th century opinions about the culture of the Chitpavans was that they were frugal to the point of appearing cheap, impassive, not trustworthy and also conspiratorial. According to Tilak, a Chitpawan himself, his community was known for cleanliness and being industrious but he suggested they should learn virtues such as benevolence and generosity from the Deshasthas. During the heyday of the Maratha Empire, the city of Pune became the financial metropolis of the empire with 150 big and petty moneylenders. Most of these were Chitpavan or Deshastha Brahmins. D.L.Sheth, the former director of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies in India (CSDS), lists Indian communities that were traditionally \\"urban and professional\\" (following professions like doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, etc.) immediately after Independence in 1947. This list included Chitpawans and CKPs(Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus) from Maharashtra; the South Indian Brahmins; the Nagar Brahmins from Gujarat; the Punjabi Khatris, Kashmiri Pandits and Kayasthas from northern India; the Probasi and the Bhadralok Bengalis; the Parsis and the upper crusts of Muslim and Christian communities. According to P.K.Verma, \\"Education was a common thread that bound together this pan Indian elite\\" and almost all the members of these communities could read and write English and were educated beyond school. = Language = Chitpavan Brahmins in Maharashtra speak Marathi as their language. The Marathi spoken by Chitpavans in Pune is the standard form of language used all over Maharashtra today. This form has many words derived from Sanskrit and retains the Sanskrit pronunciation of many, misconstrued by non-standard speakers as \\"nasalised pronunciation\\". = Social status = Earlier, the Deshastha Brahmins believed that they were the highest of all Brahmins and looked down upon the Chitpavans as parvenus (a relative newcomer to a socio-economic class), barely equal to the noblest of dvijas. The Deshastha Brahmins and the Karhadas treated the Peshwa's caste with contempt and refused to interdine with them. Even during the days of earlier Peshwa's they hesitated the admit the Chitpavans to social equality. Even the Peshwa was denied the rights to use the ghats reserved for Deshastha priests at Nashik on the Godavari river.Patil, U.R., 2010. Conflict, identity and narratives: the Brahman communities of western India from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries (Doctoral dissertation) After the appointment of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa, Konkanastha migrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune, where the Peshwa offered some important offices to the Konkanastha caste. The Konkanastha kin were rewarded with tax relief and grants of land. Historians point out nepotism and corruption during this time. The rise in prominence of the Chitpavans compared to the Deshastha Brahmins resulted in intense rivalry between the two communities. 19th century records also mention Gramanyas or village-level debates between the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus and the Chitpavans, Saraswat Brahmins and the Chitpavans, Pathare Prabhus and the Chitpavans and Shukla Yujurvedi Deshastha Brahmins and the Chitpavans. These were quite common in Maharashtra. Bal Gangadhar Tilak believed that the Deshasthas, Chitpawans and Karhades should get united. As early as 1881, he encouraged this by writing comprehensive discussions on the urgent need for these three Maharashtrian Brahmin sub- castes to give up caste exclusiveness by intermarrying and dining together. Starting in the 20th Century, the relations between the Deshastha Brahmins and the Chitpavan Brahmins have improved by the large-scale mixing of both communities on social, financial and educational fields, as well as with intermarriages. =Diet= Traditionally, Chitpavan Brahmins are vegetarian. Rice is their staple food. =Bodan= A.J.Agarkar describes Bodan as follows and adds that some kind of dancing is also involved:  Notable people  *Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath and his descendants, Bajirao I, Chimaji Appa, Balaji Bajirao, Raghunathrao, Sadashivrao Bhau, Madhavrao I, Narayanrao, Madhavrao II, and Bajirao II *Nana Fadnavis (1742 - 1800), regent to Madhavrao II *The Patwardhans - military leaders under the Peshwa and later rulers of various princely states *Balaji Pant Natu - spied for the British against the Peshwa era Maratha Empire and raised the Union Jack over Shaniwar Wada. *Lokhitwadi (Gopal Hari Deshmukh) (1823-1892)- social reformerKAVLEKAR, K., 1983.

Turn over the human corpses, the lyrics said, and one could only see Vietnamese faces. \\" He became one of South Vietnam's notable singer-songwriters, after his first hit, ∆Ø·ªõt mi (Tearing Lashes) in 1958. He was frequently under pressure from the government, which was displeased with the pacifist's lyrics of such songs as Ng·ªß ƒëi con (Lullaby, about a mother grieving for her soldier son). Before April 30, 1975, Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n went on the radio in Saigon to sing the song \\"Joining Hands/Circle of Unity\\" (\\"N·ªëi v√≤ng tay l·ªõn\\") about the dream of national reconciliation between the North and the South, which he had written in 1968. On the afternoon of April 30, following D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh's proclamation of surrender, Trinh went on the radio to say that the national dream had been realized and that liberation had been achieved. After the reunification in 1975, Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n was sentenced by the new communist government, to \\"retraining\\" in a labour camp after his family had fled to Canada. However, he was eventually honoured by the government and many officials sent their respects with floral tributes. His often melancholic songs about love and postwar reconciliation earned new acceptance and popularity in later years. Many of his songs have been re-licensed to Vietnamese music companies such as Th√∫y Nga and Lang Van and sung by other artists. There are two singers' names often associated with Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n. One is Kh√°nh Ly. The other one is H·ªìng Nhung. Kh√°nh Ly helped popularize Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n's music in the early years. They often performed together in South Vietnam University campuses. Later on in his life, H·ªìng Nhung (born 1970), many years his junior, replaced Kh√°nh Ly's place until his death, breathing new life into his songs. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered at his funeral in Ho Chi Minh City, for a spontaneous ad hoc funeral concert, making such a spectacle the largest in Vietnamese history, next to the funeral procession of Ho Chi Minh. On 28 February 2019, Google celebrated what would have been Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n's 80th birthday with a Google doodle.

He laments that the 1,000 years of Vietnam's subjugation to Chinese imperial rule, the 100 years of subjugation to French colonial rule, and the ongoing civil war, together have left a sad legacy of graveyards, parched fields and burning houses. He urges the children of Vietnam to remain true to their Vietnamese identity and overcome the dividing hatred, put an end to internecine fighting and the destruction of the country. In the song \\"Song about the Corpses of People\\" (\\"H√°t tr√™n nh·ªØng x√°c ng∆∞·ªùi\\"), written in the aftermath of the Hu·∫ø Massacre, Trinh sings about the corpses strewn around the city, in the river, on the roads, on the rooftops, even on the porches of the pagodas. The corpses, each one of which he regards as the body of a sibling, will nourish the farmland. =Love songs= Love is the single biggest recurring theme in Trinh's work. His love songs constitute the majority of the songs. Most of them are sad, conveying a sense of despondence and solitude as in \\"S∆∞∆°ng ƒë√™m\\", \\"∆Ø·ªõt mi\\". Songs are either about loss as in \\"Di·ªÉm x∆∞a\\", \\"Bi·ªÉn nh·ªõ\\", or nostalgia: \\"T√¨nh xa\\", \\"T√¨nh s·∫ßu\\", \\"T√¨nh nh·ªõ\\", \\"Em c√≤n nh·ªõ hay em ƒë√£ qu√™n\\", \\"Hoa v√†ng m·∫•y ƒë·ªô\\". Other songs, additionally carry philosophical messages from a man to his lover: \\"C·ªè x√≥t xa ƒë∆∞a\\", \\"G·ªçi t√™n b·ªën m√πa\\", \\"M∆∞a h·ªìng\\". The style is sly, simple, suitable to be rendered in Slow, Blues or Boston. The lyrics are overwhelmingly poetic, candid and yet deeply poignant, oftentimes hinting elements of symbolism and surrealism.

Its French name hautbois strawberry may be anglicised as hautboy strawberry. The plants are hardy and can survive in many weather conditions and are cultivated commercially on a small scale, particularly in Italy. The fruit are small and round; they are used in the gourmet community for their intense aroma and superb flavour, which has been compared to a mixture of regular strawberry, raspberry and pineapple. Popular cultivated varieties include 'Capron' and 'Profumata di Tortona'. Distribution Leaves Musk strawberries grow wild to a limited extent in the forests of Central Europe, north into Scandinavia, and east into Russia. The musk strawberry is found growing along the edges of forests and requires moist and sheltered sites since they do not tolerate temperature fluctuations. Polyploidy All strawberries have a base haploid count of 7 chromosomes. Fragaria moschata is hexaploid, having six pairs of these chromosomes for a total of 42 chromosomes. Cultivation Musk strawberry has long been in cultivation in parts of Europe. This species was the first strawberry of any sort with a cultivar name, which was Le Chapiron (1576). By 1591, the cultivar was called Chapiton, then later Capiton. In the early 17th century an illustration appeared in the Hortus Eystettensis as fraga fructu magno. It was mentioned by Quintinye, gardener to Louis XIV, as Capron in 1672. At the beginning of the 19th century musk strawberries were the most common garden strawberry in Germany.Wachsmuth, Brigitte: Von Monats-, Wald- und Moschuserdbeeren 20-28. In: Gartenpraxis 35 4/2009 Cultivation of musk strawberries is not very different from that of garden strawberry (Fragaria √ó ananassa) or alpine strawberry (Fragaria vesca); the plants thrive in nutrient-rich soils. However, neither female plants nor hermaphrodite plants are self-fertile; they require pollen transfer from a male or a different hermaphrodite clone (or cultivar) of the same species, which is usually achieved by insect pollinators. Cultivars: *'Capron royal', hermaphrodite *'Askungen' (Truedsson) hermaphrodite *'Marie Charlotte' (Hans) hermaphrodite *'Bauwens', female *Fragaria moschata 'Capron', female *'Profumata di Tortona', female *'Siegerland', female *'Cotta', male Notes External links *F. moschata information from Ibiblio's Plants for a Future database *Den Virtuella Floran Swedish site with good photos of F. moschata. *Berried Treasure Smithsonian article on F. moschata Category:Fragaria Category:Plants described in 1766 ","title":"Musk strawberry"},{"id":"2456542","text":"Jay Malone is a Canadian comedian from Kentville, Nova Scotia.  Early career  Malone began doing standup comedy in 1999 while studying at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. He entered a comedy competition at a local pool hall called the \\"Right Spot\\" on a dare and made it all the way to the semi-finals. The following summer, after doing shows around town with a short lived sketch/standup troupe in Fredericton, Malone made the move to Toronto to pursue comedy full-time. Within two years he was headlining across the country and appearing on television in both national and international commercials and comedic series. He made three straight appearances at the Halifax Comedy Festival (2003, 2004, 2005) and was featured on The Toronto Show (Toronto One) in 2003. In 2004 Malone was invited to the prestigious Just For Laughs Festival to perform in the national Homegrown Competition. He took first place in the contest and was immediately signed with a US management/agency team. Later that year he was flown to Los Angeles where he met with casting agents in Hollywood and would return in February/March the next year to audition for network sitcoms. In the fall of 2004 Malone shot his first nationally televised special, a one-hour episode of the standup series Comedy Now on CTV and The Comedy Network. The special was chosen by the network to be the 100th episode special and received nationwide critical acclaim. In 2005 Malone returned to the Just For Laughs Festival to shoot a gala for CBC Television. He is one of only two comedians to have won the Homegrown Competition and be invited back to perform a gala the very next year. Also in 2005, he was nominated in the \\"Best Male Standup Comic\\" category at the Canadian Comedy Awards. The CTV sketch comedy series Comedy Inc. commissioned Malone to write sketches for the show in 2005. In 2006, Malone was hired on staff by the show and was featured in a few sketches and went on to write for the show for three seasons. Later that same year he shot a pilot for CTV and the Comedy Network, called House Party, co-starring David Reale.  Move to Los Angeles  Malone made the official move to Los Angeles in August 2007 after obtaining his O-1 Visa. Shortly thereafter he began doing commercials and was cast in his first guest starring role on Boston Legal the following year. He followed that up in the summer of 2008 by being cast in the Pilot Worst Week for CBS and the pilot Man Of Your Dreams for NBC. In 2009 Malone guest starred opposite Chris O'Donnell on an episode of NCIS: Los Angeles as a tax evading video game company CEO. He also guest starred as corrupt police officer \\"Russell DiMarco\\" on an episode of Monk opposite Tony Shalhoub. In November 2009 Malone was awarded a Development Deal with FOX for his Animated Short: SANTA INTERVENTION, which was awarded first prize in the international animation competition \\"The FOX Holiday Challenge\\". He followed up that animation with an animated version of the Tiger Woods Apology which has received over 2 million views. Malone is currently developing another animated series which he will be pitching to networks this spring. In 2010 Malone guest starred in Dollhouse as Clyde Randolph opposite Eliza Dushku and Harry Lennix and starred in an independent comedy by film maker/comedian Mark Bennett titled The Zombie Hell House Massacre IV. He also shot his own 30 minute standup special for the Showtime comedy series \\"Laugh Out Loud\\" 2011 was a busy year for Malone as he continued to headline across the US and Canada and was cast in his first two feature films. He plays the Algebra teacher in the upcoming film \\"Struck By Lightning\\" with Chris Colfer, Christina Hendricks, and Alison Janney. He also played the fast talking, soulless Loan Manager in the upcoming independent feature film \\"Dumbells\\" directed by Christopher Livingston. He also wrote for the MTV movie awards, the 2011 NASCAR Awards, and the Pilot \\"Moral Dilemma\\" for BBC America. In December 2011 Malone was cast as the lead in the \\"Untitled Conaco Project\\" for TBS alongside David Neher, Elizabeth Ho, Julie Haggerty and Barry Bostwick, directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller (SNL, 30 Rock, Modern Family). In the show he plays Mark Danson,a family man who quits his day job and returns to the neighborhood where he grew up. There, he reunites with his quirky childhood best friend Roland who still lives with his parents. Malone also hosted \\"Shit Talk Daily\\" a weekly podcast with friend and fellow comedian Mark Bennett and wrote and starred in a semi-weekly video series called \\"Rapid Fire Tabloid News\\" with co-host Jay Hayden. In August 2012, he began filming in Vancouver a 13-part CityTV comedy series called Package Deal, co-starring with Harland Williams.

Most of the buildings in the area were built during the Victorian Era and consist of large terraced houses built for wealthy shipbuilders, but also smaller one-storey cottages in other areas for local shipyard workers (the shipyard industry has now long gone). The place-name 'Pallion' is first attested in 1328, where it appears as le Pavylion. This is a French name meaning 'the Pavilion'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.357.

Via the Kanawha and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River. Course The Elk is formed in the Allegheny Mountains in Pocahontas County by the confluence of two short streams, the Big Spring Fork and the Old Field Fork, which join near the community of Slatyfork. It flows above ground for several miles before it sinks into a network of caverns and flows underground for more than five miles. The old riverbed of solid rock, however, remains above ground in this section known as \\"The Dries.\\" It follows a generally westward course across the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau, through Randolph, Webster, Braxton, Clay, and Kanawha Counties, past the towns of Webster Springs, Sutton, Gassaway, Clay, Clendenin, and Elkview before joining the Kanawha River at Charleston. At Sutton, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concrete dam causes the Elk to form Sutton Lake. The Elk's largest tributaries are the Holly River and the Birch River, both of which join it in Braxton County. The upper portion of the river, above Sutton Lake, is a popular coldwater trout stream.

Description  Tatsia is a dance of skill, combining the hand and body in non-stop movement. The dancer holds a sieve in his hand with the four main fingers on the top of the inside perimeter of the sieve, while his thumb is on the top of the outside. Then an assistant of the dancer (usually a woman), or even the dancer himself, puts a glass of wine on the bottom of the inside perimeter of the sieve. The wine within the glass must not exceed the middle of the glass. Then the dancer performs a variety of moves with his hands holding the sieve, as he is dancing to the rhythm. The dancer can put in the sieve as many glasses of wine as he likes. In order to put more than three though a bigger sieve is required as well as a small piece of wood to put on the three base glasses. That small piece of wood is used as a surface on which the other glasses can be put on. In any case the glasses must not touch the top perimeter of the sieve. All of the moves must be performed with speed and grace or else the glass(es) may fall or the wine spilled. The dance was created by the men in Cyprus in a form of competition or as a means to impress a woman. Some of the moves are hard to be performed even by professionals. Tatsia requires the dancer to have stamina, full control of his hands and knowledge of the footwork of the dance.  Basic moves  *1. The 8 This move is performed in front of the dancer and above his head forming a huge 8. Explaining the move: Dancer starts the move with the palm of the main hand (main hand is the hand that holds the sieve) facing out of his body in front of him. He begins to twist his wrist inwards while his body is leaning over, in order to help the sieve pass under his armpit. As soon as the sieve has passed, the dancer stops twisting his wrist, extends his hand and at the same time raises it, forming a half circle with the sieve above his head. When the sieve passes over his head, the dancer begins to lower his main hand keeping it extended until he reaches the starting position. The other hand stays extended to the side. *2. The Reverse 8 This move is exactly the opposite of the 8. The main hand starts at the starting position described earlier. The dancer begins raising his extended main hand to his side creating a big circle. As the sieve reaches the top point of the circle (above the dancer's head) the dancer begins to lower his main hand to complete the circle. Once the circle is almost complete the dancer begins to folding his angle and twist his wrist inwards his body, continuing the circle movement. The sieve passes beneath his armpit and the dancer finishes the move at starting position. This move is significantly harder than the basic 8. *3. The Change In this move the dancer changes the sieve from the main hand to his other hand. The move is the 8 move but in the middle of the big circle (above the dancers head) the other hand comes next to the main hand and grabs the sieve. The main hand now releases the grip of the sieve and becomes the other hand. In addition the other hand now becomes the main. The move continuing from the top of the circle is the reverse 8. Any other move will cause the glass(es) to fall off the sieve. *4. The Reverse Change The reverse change can be performed only while the dancer is executing a reverse 8. At the end of the big circle, just before the dancer starts to fold his angle, the hand finishes the circle behind the dancers back. The dancer begins to spin around himself at the rotation of the sieve. Simultaneously he brings his other hand behind his back and grabs the sieve. the main hand releases it and becomes the other hand. The main hand now continues to do an 8 move from the point where the dancer raises and extends his arm. The move finishes at the starting position of the 8 move.  Combinations: expert moves  *1. Windmill In this move the main hand begins in starting position (as described above). The dancer then raises his main hand extended to a full circle beginning outside his body. As soon as the sieve is on 270 degrees the dancer folds his hand and the oleni with the wrist holding the sieve are the ones to complete the circle. As soon as the circle is complete the dancer immediately stops any other movement of his main hand. Then he just reverses the process to complete the move. *2. Basic rotation This is a combination of moves. The sequence is: Basic 8-Change-Reverse 8-Reverse Change-Basic 8. *3. Knee moves Any of the above moves can be performed while the dancer sits on his knee. This is making the moves much more difficult to be executed and some of them just impossible.

His pseudonyms include Octavo and Crincrin. He was the first full-time newspaper editorial cartoonist in Canada. Personal history and career Octave-Henri Julien was born in Quebec City on 14 May 1852 to Henri and Zo√© Julien and grew up in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood. His father worked as a turner for a mechanical press and his brothers √âmile and T√©lesphore also went on to work in printing. Early influences on Julien include caricatures by the sculptor Jean-Baptiste C√¥t√©, who lived nearby among the artisans of saint-Roche, and the country folk of nearby L'Ange-Gardien who inspired many of Julien's later drawings. After the elder Julien won work with the Queen's printer George-Paschal Desbarats the family frequently moved as the capital of the Province of Canada moved: Toronto in 1855‚Äì59, Quebec City in 1859‚Äì65, and Ottawa in 1866‚Äì68, where he attended the College of Ottawa. He thereafter moved to Montreal where he apprenticed as an engraver at Leggo and Company, a partnership between William Leggo and George-√âdouard Desbarats, where he met cartoonists such as Edward Jump who worked for Desbarats's illustrated magazines Canadian Illustrated News and . Julien cartooned in Desbarats's employ until 1888; during this time he contributed to numerous other publications as well, including Le Canard and Le Violon published by Hector Berthelot, sometimes under pseudonyms such as Crincrin (in Le Violon from 1878 to 1903) and Octavo. His work included caricatures of politicians and illustrated journalism. In 1874 he accompanied George Arthur French and the North-West Mounted Police on an expedition to the fork of the Bow and Belly Rivers in Alberta; his drawings of the Canadian West appeared in the Canadian Illustrated News and L'Opinion publique in 1874‚Äì75, including a report on combatting contraband alcohol sales in Fort Whoop-Up. Julien spent six months in New York in 1888; upon his return to Canada the same year he became artistic director at the Montreal Daily Star, which thus became the first Canadian newspaper to employ a full-time editorial cartoonist. Julien stayed with the paper for 22 years and built his reputation illustrating historical even and journalistic pieces, as well as drawing caricatures of members of Parliament in the House of Commons in Ottawa. He drew notice in 1897‚Äì1900 when he had published a number of caricatures of Wilfrid Laurier and his cabinet as blackface minstrels under the title \\"By-Town Coons\\". His best known work was of rural French Canadians which he started making about 1875 and continued for the rest of his life. From 1900 he took up painting, particularly commissions for scenes from French Canadian culture. His works appeared in exhibitions at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1899 and 1907 and at the Salon of the Art Association of Montreal in 1908. Le rem√®de futur √† la corruption √©lectorale, 19 August 1875 Julien drew with speed and accuracy and attracted note for his skill at capturing expressions and gestures. He illustrated the annual and his work appeared in other Canadian publications such as John Wilson Bengough's Grip, Desbarats's Dominion Illustrated, Favourite, Jester, Canard, and Grelot, as well as foreign publications such as the American Harper's Weekly, the British The Graphic, and the French Le Monde illustr√© and L'Illustration. Julien married Marie-Louise Legault dit Deslauriers (d. 1924) in Montreal on 17 October 1876; of the couple's eighteen children, seven daughters and one son survived into adulthood. Julien died in Montreal on 17 September 1908. of a sudden stroke of apoplexy on St. James Street across from the St. Lawrence Hall. He had just left the Montreal Star in apparent good health with his son. At the time he was developing sketches for a parade to celebrate Quebec's 300th anniversary. Legacy The sculptor Louis-Philippe H√©bert eulogized Julien as \\"the most original talent in this country\\". A posthumous collection of his cartoons appeared in the Album Henri Julien in 1916. The architect William Sutherland Maxwell toured an exhibition of 125 unpublished works by Julien in 1936. The show visited Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, and at the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec in Quebec City. The National Gallery of Canada organized a retrospective of Julien's work in 1938, a unique event for a cartoonist in Canada. A print by Henri Julien of the \\"Royal Military College of Canada Uniform of Cadets\\", which appeared in the Canadian Illustrated News is in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. Accession Number: 19850291-004. The gallery L'Art fran√ßais exhibited his works in 1968. The Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec holds the most important collection of Julien's work, including La Chasse-galerie, Julien's best-known painting, inspired by a French-Canadian legend about a flying canoe.

It had a 50cc two- stroke engine (1,75 kW), 1speed (228, 207, 215) or 2speed (210, 225, 134, 193) and reached 25-50 km/h (15-30 mph). They were produced in Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica and then in Kol√°rovo, Rajec and Veƒæk√Ω Meder. Originally the Babetta was conceived as lightweight moped to compete with the Solex moped which was popular during the 1960s. The first Babetta mopeds type 228 to see the light of day in 1970 featured very large 23-inch wheels, but these were soon swapped out in favour of smaller 16-inch wheels. The Babetta was notable for its electronic ignition -- the first time a transistorized contactless ignition had been used in a moped. Type 206 was a modified type 228 produced in the years 1971-1972, mainly for Germany. Engine power was reduced to 1 kW by Jikov carburetor and at the time no driver's license was required for this Babetta. A new model 207 was presented in 1972. The wheels were now 16 inches, otherwise it had the same parameters as type 228. In 1983 the original models were replaced by the new 210 model, which featured a new engine and the 215 model with two-speed transmission that earned a reputation for being unreliable. This model was produced until 1999. In the first half of the 1990s, sales and exports gradually began to decline. By cooperation with a moped production plant in Latvia, originated Babetta 134 Stella (1989-1999). The Latvian company later went bankrupt and Babetta produced all components for the Stella. The last sold model was Babetta 193 Sting, produced was in 1994-1999 only 100 of these pieces. In 1999, the production of all Babetta types were definitely discontinued. On the remains of company in Kol√°rovo was founded a new company Sting 2000 s.r.o., it have all production documentation and produces spare parts for Babetta mopeds.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995 as part of Villa Philmonte Historic District, which included two contributing buildings, two contributing structures, and two contributing sites. Those resources are the Villa Philmonte, an associated guesthouse, two courtyards, and a pool, pergola and pond. With Background The Villa was built in 1926 by oil magnate Waite Phillips who used it to oversee his cattle ranch in northeast New Mexico. Although it is popularly considered to built in a Mission and Spanish Colonial due to its location in the American Southwest and external similarities to adobe structures, the decor and actual construction of the house was actually intended to be representative of the Mediterranean style; the house is actually coated by layers of plaster over the years giving it an adobe-like appearance. Phillips named the house by combining the first half of his name with monte, the Spanish word for mountain. In addition to the Villa, Phillips built several other retreats on his ranch's property, including Fish Camp on the Agua Fria Creek and Hunting Lodge near Cimarroncito (now Philmont Scout Ranch camps). Phillips donated the Villa, along with of land and the Philtower office building in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the Boy Scouts in 1941, supplementing a 1938 gift of that had created the Philmont Rocky Mountain Scout camp, near Cimarron, New Mexico. The Boy Scouts of America has operated the property since that time and has opened the Villa to Scouts and visitors as a museum. Regularly scheduled tours are offered during the summer. Vines climb an exterior wall Furnishings The Villa is lavishly furnished, and retains many of Phillips‚Äô original furnishings and collections, including particularly notable displays of antiques and weapons. The building features a large courtyard with a fountain in the center, large columns, and numerous porticoes. The interior was decorated using an eclectic mix of European, American, and Southwestern furnishings. The grand piano in the entrance worth an estimated $200,000. A small window on the second floor that looks towards the ranch was added to the house by Phillips after construction was completed. He wanted the window added so he could view a large rock formation on a nearby mountain. The rock was subsequently named Window Rock. A display window on the stairs between the first and second floor shows a landscape of saguaro cacti and a wagon being pulled by horses. In fact, wagons on the Santa Fe Trail were pulled by oxen, and there are no saguaro cacti in New Mexico.

Often with six holes, the shepherd's pipe is a common pastoral image. Shepherds often piped both to soothe the sheep and to amuse themselves. Modern manufactured six-hole folk pipes are referred to as pennywhistle or tin whistle. The recorder is a form of pipe, often used as a rudimentary instructional musical instrument at schools, but so versatile that it is also used in orchestral music, but it has seven finger holes and a thumb hole. Tabor pipe The three-holed pipe is a form of the folk pipe which is usually played with one hand, while the other hand plays a tabor or other drone instrument, such as a bell or a psalterium (string-drum). A minstrel playing tabor and pipe In English this instrument is properly called simply a pipe, but is often referred to as a tabor pipe to distinguish it from other instruments. The tabor pipe has two finger holes and one thumb hole. In the English tradition, these three holes play the same notes as the bottom three holes of a tin whistle, or tone, tone, semitone. Other tabor pipes, such as the French galoubet, the Picco pipe, the Basque txistu and xirula, the Aragonese chiflo or the Andalusian gaita of Huelva and gaita rociera, are tuned differently. A much larger (typically 150 to 170 cm long), sophisticated 3-hole pipe played by a growing number of enthusiasts is the Slovak fujara, made of two connected parallel pipes of different lengths. This is not to be mistaken with the Polish single pipe (fujara, fujarka), which is a much smaller (up to 40 cm) old-fashioned instrument usually made of willow bark. The latter also exists in locally modified modern versions (also played, Krzeptowski playing on small pipe folk instrument (Polish: polska \\"fujara, fujarka\\" g√≥ralska), foto: Robert Rozowski\\" from Rozbicki.com also in Google Images , Retrieved 2009-12-12 for example, in Toronto at \\"The Pride of Poland\\", a 2005 concert featuring symphonic and Polish folk music).

The English pipe and tabor had waned in popularity, but had not died out before a revival by Morris dance musicians in the early 20th century. Traditionally made of cane, bone, ivory, or wood, today pipes are also available made of metal and of plastic. Flageolet A 19th-century flageolet The flageolet was developed from the tabor pipe, in France, and became an orchestral instrument. Its lower three holes were configured the same as a tabor pipe, with two on front and one on back. A second set of three holes was added above this. The mouthpiece had a unique configuration with a sponge inside. Used as orchestral instruments into the 19th Century, the flageolet was given keys, like in the orchestral flute. Reed pipe A reed pipe is an instrument which is similar in construction to the fipple flutes but instead of a whistle mouthpiece, has a (usually) double reed, like the oboe. Hornpipe Hornpipes are instruments with one or more pipes that have single reeds that terminate in a resonator made of horn.

His role in hundreds of other cases of infanticide is unclear. Gross was head of the Spiegelgrund children's psychiatric clinic for two years during World War II. Unquiet Grave for Nazi Child Victims, Guardian (World News), 4/28/2002 A significant element of the controversy surrounding Gross' activities is that after the children had been murdered, parts of their bodies, particularly their brains, were preserved and retained for future study for decades after the murders. It was only on 28 April 2002 that the preserved remains of these murdered children were finally buried. Youth and education Heinrich Gross was born in Vienna on 14 November 1915. His parents, Karl and Petronella Gross, were in the wool and knitwear business. His father died before Heinrich was born and his mother placed him in a Catholic boarding school for his early education. He graduated from a public high school in 1934 and received a medical degree in 1939 from the University of Vienna. In 1932 Gross became a member of the Hitler Youth and joined the Sturmabteilung in 1934. He remained a member throughout the period 1934 to 1938 when these organizations were outlawed in Austria. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Gross joined the Nazi Party.Lehmann (2001)Thomas (2006) Euthanasia program Euthanasia was commonly practiced long before the infamous Nazi concentration camps. The euthanasia program was introduced to the German people as an efficient manner to obtain a Master Race for the Nazi people and an economic relief to families. As Nazi popularity grew and the economy still struggling these options were widely accepted by the German people. Am Spiegelgrund was a youth care facility on the grounds of a mental institution. From the years of 1940 to 1945 it was used for mentally handicapped adults or children. During their stay they suffered numerous forms of torture and up to 800 people were murdered there. Gross began in pavilion 15 in November 1940. By 1942 he had killed more children than any other doctor in the hospital. He became the leading psychiatrist and began studying the neurology of mentally handicapped children. With the passing of Aktion T4 the killings increased and Gross began to harvest the brains of his victims for further study. In 1943 Gross was called for military service returning pretty regularly for research until his capture in 1945.  Post-war career  In the same year of his overturned manslaughter case, Gross was allowed to resume his research at Rose Hill. In 1955, he completed his training as a specialist in nervous and mental diseases and became the head prison doctor or physician in the former Hospital and nursing home Am Steinhof. In 1957 he became the Chief court psychiatrist for men's mental institutions. There he worked with the justice system in insanity cases and was the main decision maker in all sterilization cases as well. He got promoted to the management of the \\"Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for the study of the abnormalities of the nervous system\\" created specially for him in 1968. Gross worked as a reviewer and for years was considered the most busy court expert in Austria. In 1975 the Republic of Austria awarded him the medal f√ºr Wissenschaft und Kunst 1, of which he was stripped of in 2003.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1425820/Nazi- doctor-stripped-of-his-award-for-science.html In 1975 it was realized that he had been involved in illegal killings during the Nazi occupation of Austria. Gross was stripped of many awards but continued serving as a court expert until he came under investigation in 1997 for nine counts of murder.

Programs are available in the United States Army, the United States Navy, and the United States Air Force. Created under authority of the Uniformed Services Health Professions Revitalization Act of 1972, the HPSP is the primary source of trained healthcare professionals entering the United States Armed Forces.The other sources are the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and direct commissions. Subject to eligibility for a commission (such as US citizenship, physical and academic qualifications, etc.), scholarship \\"selectees\\" are commissioned as second lieutenants in the US Army Reserve or the US Air Force Reserve, or ensigns in the US Navy Reserve. The selectees are then placed on inactive reserve status during their medical training. Prospective students compete for scholarships that cover some or all of the medical school years. The Air Force offers one- to four- year scholarships, the Army offers one- to four-year scholarships and the Navy offers three to four year scholarships. While on scholarship, the financial expenses of tuition, certain academic fees, a monthly stipend, mandatory books and equipment, and a laptop rental are paid by the student's sponsoring service. As inactive reserve officers, the students are required to serve 45 days of active duty for training (ADT) each fiscal year. While on active duty, they receive the same rights, privileges, and pay, and are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as any other active-duty officer. For the first two years of training, this duty is sometimes spent attending an officer basic course/school (Army, Navy, Air Force) or executing \\"School Orders\\" (participating in clinical training) at the student's university. For the 3rd and 4th years, the student will often carry out elective clinical rotations at a military hospital. Time spent in HPSP may count towards the 20 years required for a reserve retirement if the member participates in the selected reserve after separating from active duty, and is credited back on a one-for- one selected reserve / HPSP year basis. No HPSP time (active duty or not) counts towards an active duty 20-year retirement. Upon graduation, the students are promoted to the rank of captain in the Army and Air Force, or lieutenant in the Navy, and medical school graduates may be placed on active duty if matched for residency in a military or civilian hospital, while clinical psychology doctoral students have a similar arrangement for their one-year internship. In general, Army and Air Force medical residents are allowed to complete their residencies before proceeding to their first assignments, while Navy personnel complete an internship and then serve as a general medical officer (GMO), with the option of completing a residency following their GMO tour. Student must apply to military residencies and must accept these positions if they are offered. While wages for military residents are higher than for civilian, a military residency requires the student to fulfill further service obligations, which are paid back concurrently with the obligation from medical school. The incurred service obligation is generally one-for-one for every service-paid year of schooling, with a minimum of two years for physicians and three years for other specialties. Additional time required for certain postgraduate programs, such as lengthy residencies, can result in longer service obligations. Fulfillment of the obligation begins only after postgraduate training is completed. For Navy officers, time spent as a GMO is credited towards the service obligation. However, physicians that serve time as a GMO or flight surgeon prior to residency (after internship) will incur additional commitment of one-for-one if they complete subsequent residency training. This usually results in a longer service commitment than if they entered residency directly (example: 4 year medical commitment - 3 year GMO tour + 4-year residency = 7 year total commitment versus only 4 years if residency was entered directly). It is important to note that longer initial commitments have a significant negative financial impact; medical officers may take certain multi-year bonuses (which may equal up to 40% of total pay) which will run consecutive with initial residency and certain other commitments, resulting in substantial lost income if residency commitment payback is delayed due to GMO/flight medicine tour or sponsored fellowship/residency. HPSP opportunities are not offered by the United States Marine Corps, since it receives its medical services from the U.S. Navy.

Description Five to eleven soft, hairy white flowers are borne on a green, soft-hairy stalk that usually lifts them above the leaves. The light-green leaves are trifoliate (in threes) with toothed margins. The plant spreads mostly by means of runners (stolons), but the seeds are viable and establish new populations. Taxonomy Vilmorin-Andrieux (1885) makes a distinction between wild or wood strawberries (Fragaria vesca) and alpine strawberries (Fragaria alpina), a distinction which is not made by most seed companies or nurseries, which usually sell Fragaria vesca as \\"alpine strawberry\\". Under wild or wood strawberry, Vilmorin says: Under alpine strawberry, Vilmorin says: =Subspecies= *Fragaria vesca ssp. americana (Porter) Staudt *Fragaria vesca ssp. bracteata (Heller) Staudt *Fragaria vesca ssp. vesca L. *Fragaria vesca ssp. semperflorens L. Ecology Wild strawberry collected in the forest in the Middle Urals Fragaria vesca, fruiting plant Wild strawberry in Estonia, Pakri Peninsula. Typical habitat is along trails and roadsides, embankments, hillsides, stone- and gravel-laid paths and roads, meadows, young woodlands, sparse forest, woodland edges, and clearings. Often plants can be found where they do not get sufficient light to form fruit. In the southern part of its range, it can only grow in shady areas; further north it tolerates more sun. It is tolerant of a variety of moisture levels (except very wet or dry conditions). It can survive mild fires and/or establish itself after fires. Although F. vesca primarily propagates via runners, viable seeds are also found in soil seed banks and seem to germinate when the soil is disturbed (away from existing populations of F. vesca). Its leaves serve as significant food source for a variety of ungulates, such as mule deer and elk, and the fruit are eaten by a variety of mammals and birds that also help to distribute the seeds in their droppings. It is a larval host to the two-banded checkered skipper.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. Genomics The wild strawberry is used as an indicator plant for diseases that affect the garden strawberry. It is also used as a genetic model plant for garden strawberry and the family Rosaceae in general, due to its: *very small genome size *short reproductive cycle (14‚Äì15 weeks in climate-controlled greenhouses) *ease of propagation. The genome of Fragaria vesca was sequenced in 2010. All strawberry (Fragaria) species have a base haploid count of seven chromosomes; Fragaria vesca is diploid, having two pairs of these chromosomes for a total of 14. Flower close-up Leaf close-up Fruit close-up History, cultivation and uses Evidence from archaeological excavations suggests that Fragaria vesca has been consumed by humans since the Stone Age. Woodland strawberry fruit is strongly flavored, and is still collected and grown for domestic use and on a small scale commercially for the use of gourmets and as an ingredient for commercial jam, sauces, liqueurs, cosmetics and alternative medicine. In Turkey, hundreds of tons of wild fruit are harvested annually, mainly for export. The Ottoman strawberry (also known as the Arnavutk√∂y variety) was once cultivated in large quantities in the Arnavutk√∂y neighbourhood of Istanbul. It is also grown extensively near the town of Karadeniz Ereƒüli in Zonguldak province, Turkey. A festival to celebrate the Ottoman strawberry is held at Karadeniz Ereƒüli in June each year. Most of the cultivated varieties have a long flowering period (and have been considered by botanists as belonging to Fragaria vesca var. vesca ssp. semperflorens). They are usually called alpine strawberries. They either form runners or multiple crowns in a cluster, fruit over a very long period with larger fruit than the common wood strawberry, and are usually propagated by seeds or division of the plants. The type in cultivation is usually everbearing and produces few runners. Plants tend to lose vigour after a few years due to their abundant fruiting and flowering with final decline caused by viral diseases. Large-fruiting forms are known since the 18th century and were called \\"Fressant\\" in France. Some cultivars have fruit that are white or yellow when fully ripe, instead of the normal red. Cultivars that form stolons are often used as groundcover, while cultivars that do not may be used as border plants. Some cultivars are bred for their ornamental value. Hybrids, Fragaria √ó vescana, have been created from crosses between woodland strawberry and garden strawberry. Hybrids between the woodland strawberry and the European species Fragaria viridis were in cultivation until around 1850, but are now lost. Alpine strawberry has an undeserved reputation among home gardeners as hard to grow from seed, often with rumors of long and sporadic germination times, cold pre-chilling requirements, etc. In reality, with proper handling of the very small seeds (which can easily be washed away with rough watering), 80% germination rates at 1‚Äì2 weeks are easily achievable. Alpine strawberries are sometimes included as edging plants in herbaceous borders. =Garden varieties currently in cultivation= ;Seed-propagated: * R√ºgen, the first modern cultivar, i.e., runnerless, everbearing and large fruited ‚Äî originating from Castle Putbus in Germany, first offered 1920 by the strawberry grower Emil Spangenberg from Morsleben. * Alexandria, first offered 1964 by George W.

He is also the protagonist of The Rugrats Movie (1998) and Rugrats Go Wild (2003), and a major character in Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (2000), as well as other various Rugrats-related media. In Rugrats, Tommy is a one-year- old baby and the leader of the show's other infant characters. He is inquisitive, wants to explore everything, and often breaks out of his crib and gets himself into unusual situations. Writer Steve Viksten said his adventurous personality was partially modeled after the actor John Wayne. All Grown Up! depicts an adolescent version of Tommy, who is now 11 years old. Rugrats co-creators Paul Germain and Arlene Klasky have both claimed to have created the Tommy Pickles character, with both saying he was based upon their real-life sons. The character's first name comes from Germain's son, and he was drawn to resemble the baby son of Klasky and her then-husband, fellow Rugrats co-creator G√°bor Csup√≥. The character was voiced by E. G. Daily, who based her performance on a child character she had been developing since she her youth. Daily voiced Tommy for the entire 13-year run of the Rugrats series, as well as the films, and returned to voice the older version of the character in All Grown Up! Tommy Pickles has been very well received by reviewers and fans, and as the central character on the network's top-rated program, he was considered pivotal in Nickelodeon's rise in the 1990s. Character history =Family= Tommy was born Thomas Malcolm Pickles, the eldest son of Stuart \\"Stu\\" Pickles, a self-taught inventor specializing in children's toys, and Didila \\"Didi\\" Pickles (nee Kropotkin), a schoolteacher. Though Stu works from home, out of the family's basement, Tommy and his younger brother, Dylan \\"Dil\\" Pickles, are primarily cared for by Didi, who devotes much of her free time reading books on the latest in child development, hoping to raise her sons to be as emotionally and physically healthy as possible. As Stu is a Christian and Didi is Jewish, the family celebrates religious holidays affiliated with both Christianity and Judaism, such as Easter, Passover, Christmas, and Hanukkah. His paternal grandparents are Louis Kalhern \\"Lou\\" Pickles, and the late Beatrix \\"Trixie\\" Pickles, and his maternal grandparents are Boris Kropotkin and Minka Kropotkin. He has a paternal uncle, Andrew \\"Drew\\" Pickles, by whom he has a cousin, Angelica Pickles, and a maternal uncle, Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Kropotkin, who is rarely seen or mentioned. =Description= In the original Rugrats series, Tommy is almost always depicted as speaking in a soft voice and wearing only a baby blue shirt and diaper, though he wore a red shirt and overalls in the aired television pilot \\"Tommy's First Birthday\\" He is one year old at the beginning of the series, and has only a few strands of hair, the color of which indeterminable. He is white and through his mother, Didi, Tommy is of European Jewish heritage, her parents born and raised in Russia and later immigrating to the United States. At his age, he can only be understood by other babies and younger children, such as his cousin Angelica and his neighbor Susie, who are both three years old, and isn't able to communicate with his newborn brother, Dil, which frustrates him at times. Though the youngest of the babies, Tommy is brave and adventurous and it comes natural for him to serve as their leader, and, in stark contrast to Angelica, who frequently serves as an antagonist, he has a strong sense of justice and is unafraid to stand up for what he believes is right. Tommy is highly inquisitive, wants to explore everything, and regularly breaks out of his crib. He often uses a plastic toy screwdriver as a tool for escaping his crib and getting into places. Because of his goodhearted nature, he is sometimes easily manipulated or lied to. He is closest to Chuckie, as Phil and Lil, being twins, spend most of their time with one another and a strong familial bond. His catchphrase is \\"A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.\\" The series All Grown Up! depicts Tommy and the other Rugrats children as adolescents. Tommy, now 11 years old, bears resemblance to both his mother and father, with palatinate hair similar to Stu and a button nose similar to Didi. A nod to his childhood, Tommy still carries his toy screwdriver with him as part of his keychain. He has become less of a leader to his friends and more of an equal and while he still has a strong sense of right and wrong, he is sometimes hesitant to do the right thing for fear of being rejected or teased by peers, as is typical for an adolescent. He has remained best friends with Chuckie throughout the years, still encouraging him to step outside of his very small comfort zone, and somewhat critical of Dil, whose abnormal tendencies sometime embarrass or confuse him. He shows a strong interest in filmmaking. In the first season, Tommy wears a white shirt with yellow sleeves, but from the second season onward, Tommy and the other characters expanded their wardrobe and began wearing many different outfits. =Rugrats= As the main protagonist of Rugrats, Tommy Pickles appears in the majority of episodes across the show's 13-year run, with many of the storylines centering around him and his family, and with the Pickles household often serving as the primary setting. The original unaired pilot for the series, \\"Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing\\", revolved around Tommy breaking out of his crib to travel to the bathroom and investigate the \\"great white thing,\\" which is actually a toilet. The first aired episode of Rugrats was \\"Tommy's First Birthday\\", which was broadcast on Nickelodeon on August 11, 1991. It centered around Tommy first birthday and his birthday party, during which he and the other children believe that eating dog food will turn them into dogs. Some of the first season episodes featured such plotlines as Tommy journeying into a neighbor's house to retrieve a lost ball, Tommy making a mess at a fancy restaurant at his dad's work function, Tommy getting lost at the school where his mother teaches, and Tommy wandering around the stadium during a baseball game, in which he ultimately ends up playing. In the episode \\"Weening Tommy\\", his mother transition Tommy away from using a baby bottle, which he resists. Other episodes involved Tommy trying to escape from the doctor's office to avoid a shot, Tommy becoming fearful after Angelica tells him his parents will give him away at a family reunion, and Tommy developing a fear of getting sucked down the bathtub drain. One of the most notable episodes was \\"A Rugrats Passover\\", in which Tommy's Grandpa Boris tells the children the Jewish story of the Exodus on Passover. This leads the children to imagining themselves as part of the story, with Tommy playing the part of Moses. Tommy Pickles has been featured in several other Rugrats-related works outside of the main series. He is the protagonist of The Rugrats Movie (1998), the story of which is centered around the birth of Tommy's brother, Dil. Throughout the film, Tommy struggles with the sudden change in his family's dynamic and with accepting Dil, who, being a newborn, does not understand the concept of sharing, cooperating, or being nice as Tommy does, which Tommy finds to be incredibly difficult to deal with. Ultimately, Tommy comes to accept Dil at the end of the film. Tommy Pickles is also featured in Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (2000), which is set in Paris and focuses primarily on the wedding of Chuckie's father, as well as Tommy's father Stu being summoned to the amusement part Reptarland to fix a malfunctioning Reptar robot. Tommy appeared as the protagonist once again in the film Rugrats Go Wild (2003), a crossover of Rugrats and the Nickelodeon animated series The Wild Thornberrys, in which Tommy and his family and friends become shipwrecked on a deserted island, where they meet the Thornberry family. Tommy made additional appearances in the straight-to-DVD films Rugrats Tales from the Crib, which were released between 2005 and 2006. In July 2018, it was announced that Tommy would appear in newly-planned Rugrats television series and a live-action film featuring characters rendered with computer-generated imagery. However, those plans were shelved in November 2019 and no updates have been provided since. =All Grown Up!= In addition to Rugrats and its related films and media, Tommy Pickles was the protagonist of All Grown Up!, which depicts him and the children from the original series as adolescents. The concept for the series derived from \\"All Growed Up\\", a Special episode of Rugrats that aired on July 21, 2001, to celebrate the series' 10th anniversary, which portrayed the original characters 10 years into the future. Tommy remains the ringleader of his group of friends, though he has now developed a strong interest in filmmaking and makes movies with a camcorder, partially inspired by his encounter with Nigel Thornberry in Rugrats Go Wild. A few episodes have been made around this fact; \\"Truth or Consequences\\" revealed he made his first film at the age of 37 months, then making a negative film about his friends. The main storyline of \\"Brother, Can You Spare The Time?\\" opened with him mentioning recently winning a young filmmaker's award; and one storyline in the episode \\"Bad Aptitude\\" was about Tommy's sudden early retirement from filmmaking after making a flop and receiving an unfavorable (for his filmmaking aspirations) result on his career aptitude exam. However, he has not been seen with his camcorder since \\"The Big Score\\", when he was filming Lil at the soccer field. In the episode \\"River Rats\\", Tommy was shown to be afraid of water, stemming from an experience during a fishing outing with his grandpa. Up until early Season 2, Tommy was also either shown or mentioned as being part of the school soccer team, even trying to teach Dil how to play in the episode \\"Fools Rush In\\". Tommy had his first kiss with Olivia in the episode \\"Fear of Falling\\". He also develops a romantic relationship with a character named Rachel, who he meets in the episode \\"Rachel, Rachel\\" after they met each other at Hebrew school. It is also implied in the episode \\"TP + KF\\" that Tommy and Kimi Finster may have feelings for each other. All Grown Up! featured Tommy Pickles' final appearance, in the episode \\"Golden Boy.\\" Conception Tommy Pickles was one of several characters inspired by the real-life children of the writers and creators of Rugrats at the time the show was conceived. Accounts have differed as to who originally created Tommy Pickles. Rugrats co-creators Paul Germain and Arlene Klasky have both claimed to have created the character, with both saying he was based upon their real- life sons. Both, however, say the character was named after Germain's son, Tommy Germain, who was one year old when Rugrats was created. Tommy Pickles was temporarily named \\"Ollie\\" during the show's creation phase before being renamed Tommy. The last name \\"Pickles\\" was a name that Germain said \\"just occurred to me\\". According to Klasky, Tommy Pickles was first illustrated by G√°bor Csup√≥, Rugrats co-creator and Klasky's husband at the time. The character and was drawn to look Brandon Csup√≥, the young son of Klasky and Csup√≥, who Klasky described as \\"pigeon-toed, skinny legs, big head, no hair\\". Csup√≥ has described Tommy as \\"a spoof on all little balding babies\\". After Tommy was first conceived and illustrated, Klasky said the Tommy Pickles character was further developed by Germain in his capacity as the story editor, along with his writing staff. Writer Steve Viksten portrayed Tommy as more adventurous than the other characters, and partially modeled the character after the actor John Wayne. Viksten wrote the line: \\"A baby‚Äôs gotta do what a baby's gotta do\\", which became synonymous with the character. As the series progressed, Klasky inserted more elements of her personal life into Tommy's character, such as being part of an interfaith family and being of Russian Jewish descent. Tommy Pickles has been used in various Rugrats episodes to highlight and explore irrational childhood fears, such an episode in which he avoids using the bathtub for fear that he will be sucked down the drain. Portrayal Tommy Pickles was voiced by actress E. G. Daily. The voice Daily conceived for Tommy was one of a child character she had been developing since she her youth, and regularly performed to amuse her friends throughout her life. She described as \\"just a little boy character that kind of lives in me [that] wasn't derived from anything in particular.\\" Immediately upon first seeing claymation of Tommy Pickles, she felt that voice was the correct fit for the character, describing it as \\"the first voice that came out of me\\" and \\"the right kind of voice for that look\\". Daily said of the character: Cheryl Case had also auditioned for the part of Tommy Pickles and did not get it, but later became the voice actress for the character Angelica Pickles. Rugrats was one of the first voice-over auditions in which Daily participated. She almost did not attend because she was having carpet fitted in her apartment and didn't want to leave the workers alone, but her agent encouraged her to go. She replaced a different actress used in the pilot episode, and re-dubbed the first few episodes her own performance. Daily was pregnant and went into labor during the recording of one of her Rugrats episodes. She was having contractions between takes of dialogue, and delivered the baby not long afterward. Daily voiced Tommy for the entire 13-year run of the Rugrats television show, and returned to portray the character in the Rugrats films and the All Grown Up! series. Daily said it was initially a challenge adjusting to an older voice for Tommy in the first episodes of All Grown Up!, particularly when the voice cast was \\"just coming in and trying to define everybody and how they‚Äôve grown\\". Reception The character of Tommy Pickles has been well received. He is included on a Ranker.com list of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. Jane Holahan of the Lancaster New Era wrote \\"All kids in America love Tommy\\". Karen Hershenson of Contra Costa Times wrote in a 1998 article that \\"more than 23 million viewers tune in each week to watch Tommy\\". The San Jose Mercury News wrote in 1998 that \\"Tommy Pickles is a bigger star than George Clooney.\\" Doug MccCausland of Alternative Nation called Tommy Pickles an \\"iconic character\\". The Plain Dealer critic Joanna Connors described Tommy as \\"breakout hero\\" of the Rugrats series. Associated Press writer John Rogers praised the character's fearlessness and longevity, and wrote during the show's 10 year anniversary: \\"Ten years ago, a bald- headed, bug-eyed baby wearing an ill-fitting diaper squirted milk onto a TV screen ‚Äì and a new hero was born.\\" The Herald News declared Tommy Pickles the best character on the series. The London Free Press described the character as \\"brave and caring\\". The Detroit News writer positively reviewed all the Rugrats baby characters but gave particular praise to Tommy writing: \\"Ya gotta love 'em, especially leader Tommy Pickles\\". Patti Thorn of Rocky Mountain News praised Tommy, describing him as the show's most \\"level-headed\\" character, who deals with childhood issues and fears \\"with heart and humor\\". Melanie McFarland of The Seattle Times wrote: \\"Kids love watching the adventures of Tommy Pickles and friends because they're funny and imaginative; parents love it because the stories ring true.\\" Los Angeles Times writer Paul Brownfield said Tommy and the other Rugrats protagonists have such longevity that they \\"will be adorning kids' T-shirts and lunch boxes for generations to come\\". Jan Susina, Professor of English at Illinois State University, described Tommy Pickles as \\"the leader and voice or reason among the babies\\", describing him as \\"a cartoon version of J. D. Salinger's wise child, in diapers\\". The Arizona Daily Star writer Phil Villarreal compared Tommy Pickles character to comic strip character Charlie Brown. Dennis King of Tulsa World praised E. G. Daily's vocal performance as Tommy, calling her a standout in a \\"stellar voice cast\\". In an otherwise negative review of The Rugrats Movie, Bob Hicks of The Oregonian singled out Tommy Pickles as one of the movie's strengths. He described him as an \\"appealing character\\" and \\"a kid who is sweet, brave, practical and morally engaged\\". A Tampa Bay Times article by Babita Persaud noted that child viewers of Rugrats particularly admired Tommy's courage. In a lukewarm review for \\"All Growed Up\\", the episode that later inspired the series All Grown Up!, Kimberly Click of Boston Herald noted that while most of the other characters are basically the same as their original incarnations in Rugrats, Tommy Pickles is \\"the only one that has matured\\". Fort Worth Star- Telegram writer Amanda Rogers noted that Tommy maintained aspects of his original goofy personality in All Grown Up! When Carlotta Harrell ran for State School Superintendent of Georgia in 2006, The Atlanta Journal- Constitution asked her what television character she identified with the most, and she replied Tommy Pickles because \\"he is respected by his peers because of his leadership abilities and judgment when making decisions\\". Tommy and the other babies of Rugrats have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the only characters from a Nickelodeon series to hold that honor. The star was added on June 28, 2001, and costumed characters of Tommy Pickles and other Rugrats babies were present for the ceremony. Not all reviews of Tommy Pickles were entirely positive. Sarasota Herald-Tribune writer Philip Booth called the character \\"likable\\" but suggested he may not be a good role model for children. Kayla Cobb of Decider.com, who was critical of the Rugrats series, said she believed the show was too redundant because every episode revolved around Tommy deciding to \\"go on some huge adventure based on some flimsy premise\\", which inevitably led to problematic situations. In a mixed review of The Rugrats Movie, Daily Herald writer Dann Gire wrote that Tommy \\"looks like a fetal form of Mr. Magoo\\". In a review of \\"All Growed Up\\", Houston Chronicle writer Lana Berkowitz said the Tommy Pickles character worked better as a baby than an adolescent, writing: \\"Although Tommy Pickles could be an interesting match for Dougs Patti Mayonnaise in another dimension, it's a relief when the kids zap back to babyhood at the end of this fantasy. Daring Tommy plays better in baggy diapers.\\"  Merchandise  Mattel has released a doll of Tommy Pickles that can sing.

It is formed near the community of Alum Creek by the confluence of the Big and Little Coal Rivers, and flows generally northward through western Kanawha County, past the community of Upper Falls and into the Kanawha River at St. Albans. History Originally named Walhondecepe by the Delaware Indians, the three rivers that make up the Coal River Watershed, Big, Little and Coal River were renamed in the 18th century by explorer John Peter Salling for the coal deposits found along its banks. Since humans first arrived in the region the three rivers that make up the Coal River Watershed have served as a vital transportation link to the Kanawha River. The Indians used the rivers as favorite hunting and fishing sites. Early settlers in the region discovered that outcrops of (Cannel) Coal along the Big Coal River could be utilized as an excellent source of heat and light. The abundant timber reserves found in the region also could be transported to the Kanawha Valley during floods and sold to the growing Kanawha Valley. The availability of large seams of Cannel Coal, which could be used to produce a very desirable coal oil, brought investors to the region in the mid-19th century. The coal could be utilized to produce a coal oil which was in high demand in the urban areas of the US. The oil was used to replace whale oil for lighting. Cannel Coal oil burned bright and produced very little smoke. The utilization of the rivers for navigation was enhanced in the mid 1851 by the construction of a 34-mile lock and dam system designed by William Rosecrans. The Coal River Navigation Company was formed and invested approximately $208,000 to complete the system. The lock and dam system was repeatedly washed out by floods but continued to be rebuilt by investors. The system operated successfully from 1855 through 1861. In 1860 over 850,000 bushels of coal were shipped. The outbreak of the Civil War stopped operations of the system but in 1867 a new company was formed and the lock and dams returned to service until 1881. Altogether the lock and dams operated for 16 years. The system is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as is a series of Log booms built after the locks on the dams were washed away as the Coal River Locks, Dams, and Log Booms Archeological District. The log booms helped to channel cut timber into Sawmill locations along the Coal River near St. Albans, WV. The Coal River from St. Albans to Upper Falls remains a federal government of the United States-designated navigable waterway. Beginning around 1800, flax mills and gristmills were built and operated along the river, yielding fiber for the production of textiles in addition to staples such as flour and cornmeal. After failed attempts by others, the Coal River and Western Railway Company established scheduled rail service along the river at the dawn of the 20th century. This finally provided a reliable source of transportation for the coal and timber industries, sparking an economic boom in the region. Environmental concerns Environmental concerns are based on underground and surface mining operations in the Coal River watershed. Coal slurry impoundments are a byproduct of coal mining and preparation and contain toxic waste including heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury. A repeat of the nearby Buffalo Creek disaster is a concern. Local volunteer watershed groups are working to restore the river and improve fish habitat and recreational opportunities. Also, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection is implementing a program to restore the Little Coal River. A series of river structures are being built to move accumulated silt in order to improve fish habitat. Marshall University was hired to conduct a comprehensive river water quality study. Big Coal River The Big Coal River rises in Raleigh County as two streams, the Clear Fork and the Marsh Fork, which join near Whitesville. The river then flows generally northwest through Boone County, past the towns of Sylvester, Seth and Racine. Little Coal River The Little Coal River also rises as two streams, the Spruce Fork in Logan County and the Pond Fork in Boone County. They meet at Madison in Boone County and the river then flows generally northward, past the towns of Danville and Julian. Tour de Coal The Tour de Coal, a \\"paddling event\\" for canoes and kayaks normally held in June, is an 11-mile trip from Upper Falls to St. Albans. Paddlers negotiate the Lower Falls, a one-mile rapid along the route. About 200 people participated in 2009.

Like some children of her age, she is a spoiled brat, and she‚Äôs also the cousin of Tommy and Dil Pickles, and serves as the main antagonist of the series, but she's portrayed as an anti-heroine in the films who would side with the babies near the end against the respective main villains. In 2002, TV Guide ranked her 7th in their list of \\"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\\". In Rugrats In the Rugrats media, Angelica has yellow hair tied up in pigtails with purple bows. She wears a purple sleeveless dress, a red and black long-sleeved blouse with flared cuffs, blue and green spotted tights, red ankle-length socks and purple shoes. She wore diapers over her tights for the entire first season, then panties underneath during the rest of the series. Angelica can best be described as the spoiled, sadistic, vain, sarcastic, devious, selfish and antagonistic cousin of Tommy Pickles. She is known for her frequently manipulating the babies for her own gain, bullies them, and calls them \\"dumb babies\\". When Susie Carmichael was introduced, she was soon favored among the babies, causing Angelica to become jealous and start a rivalry with her. Susie always tried to convince the babies that almost everything that came out of Angelica's mouth was a lie, and Angelica would, in turn, strive to convince them otherwise. Angelica's parents, Drew and Charlotte, are hardly ever around because of their jobs, so her aunt and uncle, Didi and Stu, often babysit her. Her parents rarely punish or discipline her, so it's usually up to her aunt and uncle to do so. One of the few times that Angelica was ever visibly punished/disciplined by her parents is in the episode \\"Runaway Angelica\\", father yells at and punished her for disobeying her father's orders of not going into her father's home office. Most other times, her parents just scold her instead of threatening her with punishment for her bad behavior. Angelica is an only child, as a result, she has become very spoiled, and her parents pander to her every need and tend to give her anything she wants. In the episode \\"The Baby Vanishes\\" when her father did a magazine test to see how spoiled she was he scored 49 and a half, with only 10 or less being acceptable. Being spoiled could come from her parents' vast wealth, which is used to buy her toys and very expensive birthday parties. She whines, cries, and throws tantrums to get what she wants, and her parents, particularly her father, often give in. Until Susie Carmichael came along, Angelica was unique among the regular children in that she could properly talk to grown-ups, and as such, she acted nicely towards the adults, and was notoriously mean to the other babies, especially by lying and distorting their view of the world. When Susie was introduced, Angelica soon became a rival to her and often competed with her. Almost every time Susie was in an episode, Angelica was also in it, as well. Although, despite this, Susie's introduction episode did not feature Angelica. Angelica, Susie, and Chuckie are the only Rugrats who didn't appear in the Rugrats pilot episode. Angelica dreams of being a singer, but every time she sings, it comes out horrible. This became a running gag in the series, even in All Grown Up. Despite this, no one tells her that her singing is horrible, which causes her to believe she is talented at it, despite everyone's annoyance. Later, she becomes jealous when everyone prefers to hear Susie sing instead. Angelica is three years old throughout the series (despite celebrating her birthday in a couple of episodes). Despite acting mean to the babies most of the time, it is revealed in the 1994 season finale \\"Moving Away\\" that she was the reason Tommy, Chuckie, Phil and Lil befriended each other and, even more, that Angelica considered the other babies her best friends. Also in \\"Aunt Miriam\\" it is shown that Angelica takes a lot after her great aunt Miriam, as she and Lou have the same relationship she has with Tommy. This indicates that it is possible that, like Miriam, Angelica may be jealous of Tommy for being more loved and popular among his friends and family. In addition because her parents spoil her rotten, she is still denied a lot of attention and may be jealous that Tommy's parents give him more attention then her own. In addition to that, while she also craves her parents' attention its visibly seen that her Aunt Didi, Uncle Stu, and grandfather spend more time with her than her own parents; it is possible that she has a better relationship with them and seems to care deeply for them because they give her more attention. One possible example could be in \\"The Baby Vanishes\\", when she believes she's invisible she becomes greatly upset when her Auntie Didi ignores her. Thus believing she's lost her ability to be seen by one of the few people who gives her attention. And in addition in \\"The Santa Experience\\", she actually believes her grandfather's story about getting coal and tries her best to undo the damage she's done to the twins, Phil and Lil. Angelica's the one kid that's had the most romantic love interests. In \\"Angelica's In Love\\" Angelica develops her first crush on a boy named Dean and tries even being nice to gain his affection. Although she does in the end, their romance is quickly over when Dean's mother comes to take him home. But Angelica finds a new love interest in her new neighbor Jean-Claude, who apparently returns the affections. She also developed a crush on Timmy McNulty, however he's more interested in games than her. Much to her own personal annoyance. Her first word and favorite food is cookies, and she refuses to eat most healthy foods (especially broccoli). After every spoiled conduction, she gets a sudden consequence. She is unable to blow her nose at age 3, as seen in the episode \\"All's Well that Pretends Well\\", and she makes a mess when she eats. Angelica's spoiled behavior is reflected on by her own parents. Charlotte, in a way, is spoiled as through means of her work, and tries to teach Angelica to be strong, dominating and not take \\"no\\" for an answer, in her own words \\"in a male dominated society.\\" However, because of this, she unintentionally distorts Angelica's ideas on how to be with others. In addition to that, it's hinted that Drew use to bully Stu and would tend to get Stu blamed. In Rugrats, Charlotte was Angelica's role model in some ways. Charlotte's the CEO of a major corporation throughout the series' run, and in a realistic dream sequence, she said that the only thing she liked better than corporate domination was corporate domination with her daughter. Drew is a little more responsible and reasonable with his daughter. He is often the one who worries about Angelica becoming too spoiled, but when he discusses this with Charlotte, she usually disagrees. Angelica's, as well as her parents', address is 53 Briar Cliff Lane (stated in Rugrats episode \\"Stu Gets a Job.\\" Stu mentions the address when he is calling to have Drew's car towed). Angelica has a pet cat named Fluffy. Also, since the beginning of the series, Angelica was often seen with a doll named Cynthia, which she considered her most prized possession and favorite toy. It is revealed in \\"The Seven Voyages of Cynthia\\" that Cynthia was given to her as a birthday gift. Losing Cynthia horrifies her, such as in \\"The Tricycle Thief\\" when she fought to keep her innocence to Susie so that she wouldn't let Cynthia go up in Chuckie's balloon, and told Tommy and Chuckie in \\"The Seven Voyages of Cynthia\\" that she would harm anyone who took the doll. When the series started, she, Tommy and Chuckie were their respective parents' only children. However, by the end of the series, Angelica is the only character to remain an only child‚Äîby then, Tommy had Dil as his younger brother and Chuckie had gained a stepsister named Kimi through his dad's second marriage to Kira (Kimi's mom and Chuckie's stepmom). Angelica usually expresses her thankfulness on being an only child, but there have been a few episodes where she expresses the desire to have brother or sister (most notably in \\"The Stork\\" and \\"Sister Act\\"). Angelica came 7th in TV Guide's 50 greatest cartoon characters, above Bart and Lisa Simpson and Mickey Mouse, and she was the only Rugrats character to appear on the list. =Development= Arlene Klasky did not like the cruelty in Angelica in the earlier seasons and often had disputes with the writers about it. By the time the new seasons appeared around 1996, Klasky had a more positive reception to the softened Angelica.Swartz, Mimi. \\"You Dumb Babies!\\" The New Yorker. November 30, 1998. Retrieved on February 24, 2014. In All Grown Up! In All Grown Up!, Angelica is depicted similarly to her original toddler portrayal in Rugrats, but has developed more maturity in her tastes and interests average for a girl her age, and got less sadistic and more sarcastic. Angelica is still spoiled by her parents, but to a lesser degree and in an altered fashion from the previous series. In fact, it is seen in multiple episodes that her parents attempt to try and teach Angelica more responsibility (for example, mentoring a young person or making her own money for concert merchandise). She still habitually dominates her younger cousins and acquaintances, and maintains her materialistic and selfish personality. Angelica also continues to envy Susie Carmichael (her best friend/occasional rival) for her amazing singing voice and various other talents, although she is shown to be much nicer than in the original series. Some episodes have shown that she has incredible talents of her own as well, such as being a champion debater and a well-known advice columnist. In one episode, she even upstaged Susie and her brothers in domestic house chores, which she hated at first, but grew to like and be good at. Angelica's goals and priorities throughout the episodes have also matured to fit her age, and she strives to acquire a position amongst popular cliques at her school (a goal she succeeded at, but which earned her a \\"frenemy\\") or impress boys, albeit still aided by the geeky, redheaded Harold (whom she and Susie had met when they were in preschool in the original series). She began dating a boy named Jeremy in Season 2, but shortly after she left him for another character named Ty.

The group follow the teachings of Ethiopian scholar Abdullah al-Harari. Due to the group‚Äôs origins and activity in Lebanon, the Ahbash have been described as the \\"activist expression of Lebanese Sufism\\". History The Association of Islamic Charitable Projects was founded in the 1930s by Ahmad al-Ajuz, According to Gary Gambill, the AICP arrived in Lebanon in the 1950s, where he says \\"they blended Sunni and Shi'a theology with Sufi spiritualism into a doctrinal eclecticism that preached nonviolence and political quietism\\". The AICP remained without a leader until the 1980s when Abdullah al-Harari became the nominal head of the organization. and was taken over by Al-Ahbash in 1983. Al-Ahbash was founded in the suburb of Bourj Abu Haidar, in West Beirut, as a small philanthropic and spiritualist movement among the Sunni lower classes. From there they spread throughout Lebanon to Tripoli, Akkar and Iqlim Al- Kharrub in the Chouf, where they founded educational and religious institutions. Beginning in the 1990s, Ahbash propelled from a minority group to the largest Sunni religious organization in Lebanon, mainly due to Syrian government backing‚Äîhaving close links to Syrian intelligence. The Syrians supported and promoted the Ahbash in order to limit the influence of radical and fundamentalist Sunni movements in Lebanon. Their growth was also aided by the forcible seizure and control of many prominent mosques in West Beirut in the early 1980s, despite the protests of Dar al-Fatwa (the official body for Lebanon's Sunni Muslims). At the end of the 1990s there were close to 250,000 Ahbash members worldwide, according to a high-ranking Ahbash activist. While the Ahbash still owe their original growth to the Syrians, politically, they are in an undeclared alliance with Mustaqbal, perhaps for reasons of current political expediency.https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/157969/CMEC_6_abdellatif_lebanon_final.pdf Several public figures became Ahbash members when it emerged in France beginning in 1991, such as rapper Kery James or Abd Samad Moussaoui. In 1995, members of a Salafi jihadi group called \\"Osbat al-Ansar\\" killed the leader of Al-Ahbash, Sheikh Nizar Halabi, who was reportedly being groomed by the Syrians to become Lebanon's Grand Mufti. His murder led to a heavy-handed Syrian response‚Äîconcluding with the gruesome public execution of his assassins in 1997. It has been compared to the Turkish G√ºlen movement. Religious beliefs Al-Ahbash beliefs are an interpretation of Islam combining elements of Sunni Islam and Sufism. Their religious ideology is very much in line with the traditional Sunni doctrines, although the groups sometimes unrestrained use of takfir has brought them under dissension by the wider Islamic community. Al-Ahbash follows the Shafi school and Ash'ari theology, their Sufi aspect is derived from the Rifa'i brotherhood. The group rejects Islamist figures such as Ibn Taymiyyah, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Sayyid Qutb. It advocates Islamic pluralism, and opposition to political activism (its slogan is \\"the resounding voice of moderation\\"). It also promotes its beliefs internationally through a major internet presence and regional offices, notably in the United States.  Doctrinal aspects  =Syncreticism= Shaykh Habashi's syncretic teachings draw upon a conflation of different branches of Islamic theology, and thereby elude unambiguous classification. In an address to his followers, Shaykh Habashi stated that \\"[w]e are Ash'aris and Shafi'is. The Ash'ariyya is the basis of our belief, and the Shfi'iyya is our daily code.\\" According to Thomas Pierret, Ahbash's ideology \\"can be termed \\"neo-tradionalist\\", in that it aims to preserve the Islamic heritage of the Ottoman era \\\\- which they consider themselves to be the inheritors.\\" Shaykh Habashi in his books and lectures blends elements of Sunni and Shi'a theological doctrines with Sufi spiritualism by supporting the legitimacy of Imam Ali and his descendants while condemning Mu'awiyya, the caliph and governor of Damascus, and his son Yazid as \\"seditious\\" thus adopting Shi'ite tradition whereas setting apart from all other Sunni jurists. Although not explicitly stated, Sufism plays also an important role in al-Ahbash's doctrine as demonstrated by the practice of several Sufi traditions such as the pilgrimage to holy men's tombs (Ziyarat), mystical dancing sessions, use of musical bands in religious ceremonies\\"A Sufi Response to Political Islamism\\" by R. Hrair Dekmejian & A. Nizar Hamzeh, p.225. and the support of three Sufi Tariqas. The contention that it is a primarily Sufi movement, however, has been disputed. =Moderation= Mustafa Kabla and Haggai Erlich identify \\"moderation\\" (wasatiyyah) as the key word in al-Ahbash's \\"necessary science of religion\\" and instance the group's twelve-goal platform whose second item calls for \\"[p]reaching moderation [...] and good behavior as ways of implementing religious principles, while combating extremism and zeal.\\". This position is also reflected in the groups's decided opposition to the Salafist movement and Islamist thinkers, namely Sayyid Qutb, Muhammed ibn 'Abd-al- Wahhab, and Ibn Taymiyyah. =Rejection of anthropomorphism= One further critical cleavage is al-Ahbash's strict rejection of any form of anthropomorphism of God which they accuse Wahhabis of. Consequently, Shaykh Habashi holds that \\"it does not befit God to speak like that, and his word is not a voice or letters\\"Cited in Kabla and Erlich 2006: 531 and that therefore, the Qur'an contains the word of God but could be written only after \\"Gabriel listened to His word, understood it, and passed it on to the prophets and the angels.\\" This is a highly controversial point of view within Islam which is not fully compatible with the consensus of Sunnis, and Wahhabis accuse Ahbash of doubt regarding the origin of the Qur'an. Another famous example regards the interpretations of the Qur'anic sentence describing God seated on his throne after creating the world. According to Wahhabi texts, this means that he literally sat on his throne; however, according to Shaykh Habashi, copying the Mu'tazila school of thought, it meant that he took control of the world. =Separation of religion and state= The arguably most important split, however, is the question of the relation between religion, politics, and the state. Departing from most Islamic writings on this topic, al-Ahbash advocates a separation of religion and state and thereby rejects the idea of an Islamic state. Al-Fakhani, an AICP representative said \\"Most of our states are Islamic and Muslims wish the presence of an Islamic state, but the regional and international conditions do not allow it.\\" Consequently, the group repeatedly emphasized the need for Muslim-Christian co-existence and tolerance towards other religious groups in Lebanon. =Takfir= The tolerant stance in Al- Ahbash's public rhetoric is doubted by some Muslim groups, orthodox Sunni in particular. They accuse the group of an excessive use of Takfir ‚Äì the act of declaring another Muslim an unbeliever ‚Äì and thereby of the provocation of inner-Islamic tensions. Al-Ahbash has mainly used takfir against Wahhabi and Salafi leaders. According to Tariq Ramadan, Al-Ahbash \\"adherents carry on a permanent double discourse: to Western questioners, they claim to support the emancipation of women and laicism to oppose the \\"fundamentalists\\" (all the issues they know are sensitive and useful for getting them recognized). However, within Muslim communities, they carry on an extremely intransigent and closed discourse, usually treating most of the principal Muslim ulama as kuffar *by which they mean \\"unbeliever,' \\"impious people\\"). They base their teachings on interpretations recognized as deviant by all other schools of thought and all other scholars of note (for example, their singular understanding of the meaning of the name of God, or their assertion that the Qur'anic Text was interpreted by the angel Gabriel, or the practice of praying to the dead). Their approach on very specific points of doctrine (such as those we have referred to) is hostile and usually violent.\\"  Political positions  As a political party, when al-Ahbash ran for the 1992 Lebanese parliamentary elections, this constituency enabled its candidate, Adnan Trabulsi, to win a seat in a Beirut district after the Ahbash and Hezbollah concluded an undeclared alliance in Beirut that assured the election of their respective candidates. However, Trabulsi lost in the subsequent 1996 elections.Hamzeh and Demekjian 1996: 225; el Khazen 2003: 620, Table 2 In 2018, Trabulsi was again elected to serve on the Lebanese Parliament. The Ahbash are also allied to the other major Shia party, the Amal Movement. Controversy The group are seen as being controversial within Islam for its anti-Salafi religious stance, as their Sufi and other beliefs are seen as heretical. As a result, they are commonly described by Wahhabis as combining \\"Sufi polytheism, shirk, with Shi'i covert anti-Sunna tactics\\". (Refers to Al- Ahbash's own monthly magazine, Manar Al-Huda 93 (December 2000): 36-42 and their other sources and web-sites.) They are also viewed by other Muslims groups as being favoured by the governments of the United States, Europe, Ethiopia, and Australia, who \\"do indeed welcome the Ahbash activities among their Muslim citizens.\\" They have been described as a sect by various commentators, while others see them as a valid religious movement. The AICP claims to run its Islamic schools in affiliation with Al-Azhar, a claim which has been denied by Al-Azhar. (Excerpts from the letter from Arabic to English regarding AICP or Al-Ahbash: \\"There is no single form of recognition/accreditation and cooperation between Al-Azhar University and them. All papers, in which what is otherwise claimed (by this organization) do not correspond to the truth. We reject all attempts to abuse the prestigious name of Al-Azhar University by this organizations..\\") (Excerpt: \\"These announcements are embedded in the following literature and media: Professor Dr. Ahmad Omar Hashim\`s letter, Al-Azhar University President, to Muslim World League\`s Secretary-General in August 24, 2001.\\") (Excerpt: \\"Conference participants, who included Ahmed El- Tayeb, rector of Cairo's Al-Azhar Islamic University, adopted a fatwa stipulating that the sole true adherents of traditional Islam are those who abide by Kalam scholastic theology, belong to one of the four madhhabs (legal schools)......It identifies the Salafi strain of Sunni Islam professed in Saudi Arabia as a \\"dangerous and erroneous contemporary sect,\\" along with the extremist group Islamic State, Hizb ut- Tahrir, and the Habashis.\\") =Australia= In 2011, the Australian National Imams Council accused the Muslim Community Radio Incorporated as being associated with Al-Ahbash, which they described as a fringe cult organisation and violent, and made public announcement for government officials not to renew its broadcasting license. However, the Australian Communications and Media Authority granted a 5-year license in 2011, which drew criticism from Islamic groups. In 2006, the Imam of Lakemba Mosque in Sydney, Taj El-Din Hilaly, threatened to back out of the Howard Government's, Muslim Community Reference Group because of the inclusion of Dr. Mustapha Kara-Ali, who was affiliated with Al-Ahbash. =Egypt= In 2003, Ali Gomaa, the former Grand Mufti of Egypt, issued a fatwa describing the Ahbash as \\"deviant\\" that sought to \\"corrupt the Muslim creed and incite sedition amongst the Muslim Ummah. Moreover, they are paid agents to the enemies of Islam.\\" In 2007, Egypt also arrested 22 men for seeking to spread the Ahbash faith in the country.\\"Egypt arrests 22 men for corrupting Islam\\"- Reuters, 13 December 2007. (\\"The source said they belong to the al-Ahbash sect ‚Äì which has a significant following in Lebanon and strong historical ties to Syria ‚Äì and which is considered unorthodox by many Islamic clerics including the ones at Al-Azhar.\\") =Ethiopia= In 2012, Muslim protesters in Addis Ababa accused the Ethiopian government of Meles Zenawi of promoting Al-Ahbash among the Muslim population of the country. =Germany= In 2008, several Berlin based Muslim organizations were not granted municipal permits to build mosques, however, Al-Ahbash (AICP) was granted a permit stipulating that proposed building of the mosque's architectural structure keeping the 19th century structural of the neighboring houses. =Jordan= During the 1990s fighting broke out between the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Ahbash in what became known as the \\"war of the mosques\\". The fighting was started due to the brotherhood believing that Jordan's Ministry of Religious Endowments were giving precedence to Al- Ahbash members being allowed to teach in mosques from which they themselves were banned. =Lebanon= Due to its strong historical links with the Syrian government of the al-Assad family, the Ahbash have often been in conflict with the Lebanese supporters of the anti-Syrian Hariri family and in 2005 at least two of its members were initially implicated‚Äîjailed and later released‚Äîin the Assassination of Rafic Hariri. The Ahbash also strongly opposed and demonstrated against the Cedar Revolution that was triggered by Hariri's assassination.Barry Rubin, Guide to Islamist Movements, pp.322-323.David Gardner, I.B. Tauris, Last chance: the Middle East in the balance, 15 June 2009, the University of Michigan, pp. 135, 140. Ahbash reportedly remains neutral in the Syrian Civil War, despite pressure from both sides. In 2010, Ahbash and Hezbollah members were involved in a street battle which was perceived to be over parking issues. Both groups later met to form a joint compensation fund for the victims of the conflict. However, despite this instance of violence, the Ahbash have \\"normal\\" and \\"friendly\\" relations with Hezbollah. The Ahbash have also engaged in bloody clashes in Sidon and Tripoli, in the 1990s, against the rival Sunni Al-Jama'ah Al-Islamiyah. = North America = The Al-Ahbash pray using the South-east direction in Canada and the United States versus majority of the Muslims who pray towards Qiblah using the North-east direction in their mosques. =Saudi Arabia= Former grand mufti of Saudi Arabia Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz declared Ahbash a \\"deviant faction\\". =Ukraine= Roman Silantiev states that the mufti of Ukraine, Ahmad Tamim, a Lebanese citizen, has been accused of belonging to the \\"sinister sect\\" of Ahbash by his opponents, however, his opponents find it difficult to define the heresy of Ahbash. Ahmad Tamim's opponent mufti Said Ismaigilov allegedly has links to groups affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.

The original Nut Tree  =History= The original Nut Tree opened in 1921 on the Lincoln Highway (old U.S. Route 40). It was created by Helen and Ed \\"Bunny\\" Power as a small roadside fruit stand, and built near the site of Helen's childhood home ('Harbison House' dating from 1907), which she and her husband purchased from her parents not long after their 1920 marriage. The black walnut tree after which the Nut Tree was named grew from a black walnut that pioneer Sallie Fox had picked up along a trail in Arizona before arriving in Vacaville in 1859. The Nut Tree grew as US 40 became Interstate 80. At its peak, it contained a restaurant, an outdoor eatery, a bakery, a gift shop, a toy shop, the Nut Tree Railroad that gave rides from the toy shop to the airport, and the Nut Tree Airport, which is now owned and operated by Solano County. It was a welcome rest stop on the road between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area. Throughout the year, kids enjoyed giant frosted honey cookies (personalized on request), the numerous \\"Hobby Horses\\" rocking horses and riding the train. It welcomed several celebrities, including Ronald Reagan when he became California governor in 1967, Richard Nixon, Danny Kaye, Shirley Temple Black, Chuck Yeager, Peter Marino, and Bing Crosby, among others. On March 4, 1983, Nut Tree catered a luncheon hosted by (California) Governor George Deukmejian for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at the State capitol. Beginning in 1980, Nut Tree was home to a month-long October harvest event called 'Pumpkin Patch'. Pumpkin Patch attractions included a great scarecrow contest, a giant pumpkin display and weigh-in, and pumpkin carving contests. =Role in California cuisine= The Nut Tree Restaurant was an early pioneer of California cuisine, with fresh fruits and vegetables featured in the recipes. By 1978, it was identified as \\"the region's most characteristic and influential restaurant.\\" It also featured small loaves of wheat and rye bread, cooked fresh each day on the premises. A notable feature of the restaurant was its large indoor aviary, which had glass walls extending from floor to ceiling. Nut Tree knives and cutting boards, as well as books on aviation, were sold in the gift shop. A recipe book called Nut Tree Remembered - The Cookbook was printed by the Vacaville Museum in 1997. It contains 40 recipes, and more than 100 photos and graphics from the restaurant and retail stores that closed in 1996. As of September, 2015, they still accept phone orders for the remaining copies. = Design = Don Birrell served as the design director for the Nut Tree from 1953 until his retirement in 1990. Ed Power hired Charles Eames to design the Nut Tree's furniture. A 1957 trip to Denmark gave Ed Power and Don Birell the idea of designing the Nut Tree's patio area to resemble the Tivoli Gardens with special lighting and kiosks. =Coffee Tree= The Coffee Tree was a coffee shop and restaurant that was a subsidiary of the Nut Tree. The Coffee Tree opened in 1965 across Interstate 80 from the Nut Tree restaurant. The Coffee Tree building was designed by architects Dreyfuss and Blackford in 1965. The Coffee Tree building with its distinctive curved roof line was featured in the October 1966 issue of Architectural Record and received an AIA Central Valley Merit Award in 1967. The interior of the Coffee Tree was largely designed by Don Birrell, the design director of the Nut Tree, along with the Coffee Tree's logo and menu designs. The Coffee Tree displayed artwork from artists such as Ruth Dicker, whose work was sometimes featured in the Coffee Tree menus as well. The Coffee Tree was known for several of its signature items, such as a large elongated hamburger known as the \\"Buddy Burger\\" and an \\"Ice Cream Clown\\" (a scoop of ice cream with an ice cream cone for hat and a candy clown face). The gift shop sold Nut Tree frosted gingerbread cookies featuring designs by Don Birrell. It also sold glass jars of colored sugar crystals in an assortment of colors. When the Nut Tree restaurant closed in 1996, many employees of the Nut Tree restaurant migrated to the Coffee Tree. The Coffee Tree building was demolished in 2005. =Financial issues and closure= The Nut Tree ceased operations in 1996 due to financial issues brought about by a family feud that was taken to court. The main Nut Tree buildings were demolished in Fall 2003. The Coffee Tree restaurant across the I-80 freeway, another part of the original Nut Tree holdings, was demolished in late 2005. The old original Harbison house was donated to the Vacaville Museum in 1998 and is being restored in a new location 1000 feet from the original site. Redevelopment and Reopening Nut Tree reopened in 2006 as a mixed-use development of Snell and Co. It contains Nut Tree Family Park (children's amusement park), Nut Tree Bocce Grove (bocce ball venue), Nut Tree Village (restaurants and stores) and Nut Tree Complex (retail, hotel, offices, residences). Retailers operating at opening were Best Buy, Sport Chalet and BevMo!. The restored Harbison House (which the Nut Tree had open for public tours during its final years of operation) is a major centerpiece of the development. It opened in October 2009. Between the time that the Nut Tree closed and its building was demolished, the Northern California Renaissance Fair was held on its grounds for several years running. The Nut Tree Family Park closed on January 14, 2009 due to the lack of attendance. On August 22, 2009, the grand opening celebration was held for the reopening of the Nut Tree, under the new ownership of Westrust. The new Nut Tree adopted some of the original attractions, such as the Nut Tree Railroad and other historical elements of the original Nut Tree, along with new elements such as a carousel.

Askia Mohammad Benkan, also Askiya Muhammad Bonkana, was the 3rd ruler of the Songhai Empire from 1531 to 1537. Mohammad Benkan assumed power after Askiya Musa (son of Askia Mohammad I) was assassinated. Musa was assassinated in the village of Mansura on Wed 12 April 1531, and on that same day, Mohammad Benkan became Askia: > Shocked by Musa's ruthless actions to eliminate rivals, his brothers > conspired together and killed him. It was during this chaos that Benkan, the > Kurmina-fari (also Kan-fari, both meaning military captain of Kurmina with > the Kurmina-fari being the highest-ranking captain in the empire) and son of > Umar Komadiakha (brother of Askia Mohammad), seized control of the throne > despite opposition from Alu (one of the sons of Askia Mohammad) and took the > position of Askia. To secure his position Benkan then banished Askia Mohammad, his paternal uncle to the island of Kangaba, in the River Niger to the west of Gao. Musa who had previously dethroned Askia Mohammad (his father), had allowed him continued residence in Gao. Benkan appointed his brother Uthman ibn Amar to the position as Kurmina-fari. The Tarikh al-Sudan contains this description of his court: > Askiya Muhammad Bonkana furbished the court splendidly, enlarging it, > adorning it, and embellishing it with more courtiers than ever before. He > supplied sumptuous garments, invented different types of musical instruments > (versions of the trumpet-like fotorifo, and deep sounding gabtanda drum), > and sponsored many male and female singers. He gave out abundant largesse > and benefactions. During his reign divine favours were bestowed, doors were > opened, and blessings poured forth. Benkan tried to reverse his uncle's policy of relying on the towns, preferring instead to gather support from the peasants. However, after a series of military failures, most notably suffering a terrible defeat at the hands of Muhammadu Kanta, the Sarkin of Kebbi. Muhammad Benkan was himself deposed in 1537, and was succeeded by Askiya Isma'il son of Askiya al-hajj Muhammad. Muhammad Bonkana went blind before he died in around 1559. Kanta was once the Leka-fari and a Barde, one of the great captains of Askia Mohammed. However, Kanta had revolted against Askia and with his followers moved into the territory of the Kebbawa taking control and establishing the independent state of Kebbi. Notes References *. *.

Distribution As the name indicates, it was centered on the middle reach of the Dnieper River and is contemporaneous with the latter phase and then a successor to the Indo-European Yamnaya culture, as well as to the latter phase of the Tripolye culture. Geographically, the Middle Dnieper culture is directly behind the area occupied by the Globular Amphora culture (south and east), and while commencing a little later and lasting a little longer, it is otherwise contemporaneous with it. The Fatyanovo‚ÄìBalanovo culture is, in turn, considered an eastern extension of the Middle Dnieper culture. Characteristics More than 200 sites are attested to, mostly as barrow inhumations under tumuli; some of these burials are secondary depositions into Yamnaya-era kurgans. Grave goods included pottery and stone battle-axes. There is some evidence of cremation in the northerly area. Settlements seem difficult to define; the economy was much like that of the Yamnaya and Corded Ware cultures, semi-to-fully-nomadic pastoralism.J. P. Mallory, \\"Middle Dnieper Culture\\", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997. Ethnicity Within the context of the Kurgan hypothesis of Marija Gimbutas, this culture is a major center for migrations (or invasions, if one prefers) from the Yamnaya culture and its immediate successors into Northern and Central Europe. It has been argued that the area where the Middle Dnieper culture is situated would have provided a better migration route for steppe tribes along the Pripyat tributary of the Dnieper and perhaps provided the cultural bridge between Yamnaya and Corded Ware cultures. This area has also been a classic invasion route as seen historically with the armies of the Mongol Golden Horde (moving east to west from the steppes) and Napoleon Bonaparte (moving west to east from Europe).Rifkin, M. 2007. A Spatial Analysis of Neolithic Cultures throughout Eastern, Central, and Northern Europe in Relation to Proto-Germanic. Journal of Indo-European Studies. 35 (1 & 2): 53‚Äì81 On the other hand, the Middle-Dnieper culture has been viewed as a contact zone between Yamnaya steppe tribes and occupants of the forest steppe zone possibly signaling communications between pre-Indo-Iranian speakers and pre-Balto-Slavs as interpreted by an exchange of material goods evident in the archaeological record sans migration.Telegin, D. 2005.

A Yankee who migrated from New England, he was a successful Republican businessman turned politician. As a businessman turned politician, Pingree was elected mayor in 1889 after a colorful campaign in which Pingree revealed his tolerance by making a circuit of saloons. Pingree added to the old stock Yankee Republican base by making large inroads into the German and Canadian elements. He was reelected in 1891, 1893 and 1895. Warning repeatedly against the dangers of monopolistic corporations, he launched nationally visible crusades against Detroit's streetcar, gas, electric, and telephone companies. He successfully forced rate reductions that won him widespread popularity. He won public approval for a citizen-owned electric light plant and became a national spokesman for municipal ownership and public regulation of utilities and street railways. When the nationwide Panic of 1893 caused a severe depression, Pingree gained support by opening empty lots to garden farming launching Pingree's \\"Potato Patch Plan,\\" initially financed by Pingree, who sold his prize horse to pay for the farming tools and seeds. Pingree was a Republican, whose policies competed for support of the Populist Party voters and labor union members. He supported the gold standard in 1896, and worked to carry Michigan for William McKinley over silverite William Jennings Bryan in the intensely competitive 1896 U.S. presidential election. Pingree was on the ballot too, and was elected governor of Michigan. As governor, he succeeded in forcing passage of the nation's first major statewide reappraisal of railroad and corporate property, with intent on implementing taxes. That led to a rational basis for railroad regulation and other trust busting ideas launched by the Republican Party.Melvin G. Holli, Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics (1969) A survey of scholars in 1999 ranked Pingree as the fourth-best mayor in all of American history. Early life in Maine and Massachusetts Pingree was born in Denmark, Maine, to Jasper Pingree and Adeline (Bryant) Pingree and attended the common schools in Maine. At the age of fourteen, he moved to Saco, Maine, where he worked at a cotton factory. Two years later, he moved to Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and worked several years as a cutter in a shoe factory. Civil War In 1862, Pingree enlisted in the Union Army to serve in the Civil War with the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery Regiment (Company F). He fought on the front line during General Pope‚Äôs Northern Virginia Campaign and the Second Battle of Bull Run. The regiment he fought with was then ordered to defend Washington, D.C. until May 15, 1864, and then was sent to the front again. He fought with the Second Brigade of Tyler‚Äôs Division, Second Corps, which participated in battles at Fredericksburg Road (May 18), Harris Farm (May 19), and Spotsylvania Court House (May 19‚Äì21). His regiment was then assigned to the Second Corps, Third Division, in the Army of the Potomac and fought at North Anna (May 24‚Äì25) where he and some other men were captured by a detachment of John S. Mosby‚Äôs command. Pingree was confined in Confederate prisons at Gordonsville and Lynchburg, Virginia, and at Salisbury, North Carolina. He was then taken to Andersonville prison and, while General Sherman was on his march to the sea, he was taken to Millen, Georgia, where he later escaped by pretending to be someone else during a roll call for a prisoner exchange in November 1864. Pingree rejoined his regiment, fought in many more battles, and was present at Appomattox Court House when Robert E. Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865. A few months later, on August 15, his regiment was mustered out. Business in Michigan Pingree was a cobbler by trade and, following the war, moved to Detroit and briefly worked for H. P. Baldwin's shoe company. In 1866, Pingree and his accountant, Charles H. Smith, purchased Baldwin's shoe-making machinery and formed the Pingree and Smith company. In 1883, Smith retired from the firm and J. B. Howarth and Pingree's son Joe joined the partnership. By 1886, it was a $1 million company with 700 employees turning out a half-million shoes and boots a year. It was the second biggest shoe manufacturer in the U.S. In March 1887, a fire destroyed the entire plant, yet they were able to recover.Bill Loomis, \\"Hazen Pingree: Quite possibly Detroit's finest mayor\\" (2013) In 1872, Pingree married Frances A. Gilbert of Mount Clemens, Michigan. They had three children ‚Äì Joe, Hazel, and Gertrude, who died in 1894 of tuberculosis at age 19. Mayor of Detroit Pingree had never been active in politics. As a citizen reformer he was elected mayor of Detroit in 1889 on a platform of exposing and ending corruption in city paving contracts, sewer contracts, and the school board. He soon turned to fighting privately owned utility monopolies. He challenged the electric and gas monopolies through municipally owned competitors. His largest struggle, however, was with Tom L. Johnson, president of the Detroit City Railway, over lowering streetcar fares to three cents. Pingree again attempted to create a competing municipally owned company, but was barred from creating a railway by the Michigan Constitution.Holli, 1970 When the company sought a thirty-year contract with the city, Pingree opposed it, leading a major shareholder, James McMillan, to express vehement disapproval.Detroit News online (retrieved 24 January 2018) During the severe nationwide depression of 1893, Pingree expanded the public welfare programs, initiated public works for the unemployed, built new schools, parks, and public baths. He gained national recognition through his \\"potato patch plan\\", which allowed poor people to use of vacant city land for growing food. He was also an advocate of economist Henry George's single tax. Governor of Michigan Hazen S. Pingree 1900 In 1896 Pingree was nominated as the GOP candidate for Governor of Michigan. He campaigned on a platform of pluralism, inviting the Germans and other ethnics to join a grand coalition that would bring prosperity to everyone, unlike the false prosperity promised by the silverites. He carried the state both for himself and Republican presidential candidate William McKinley. After taking office on January 1, 1897, he intended to also fill the last year of his term as mayor of Detroit, which would have lasted until elections in November 1897. However, his right to hold the two offices simultaneously was contested, and after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled against him, Pingree resigned as mayor. During his four years in office, Pingree promoted the regulation of railroad rates, equal taxation, and municipal ownership of public utilities. He also supported the direct election of U.S. senators; an eight-hour workday; an income tax; primary elections; the power of \\"referendum,\\" the abolition of child labor, and compulsory arbitration of labor disputes. Opposition from Democrats and business-oriented Republicans blocked most of his proposals. Pingree expressed the Progressive fear of corporate power, saying, \\"I do not condemn corporations and rich men,\\" he said, \\"but I would keep them within their proper spheres. It is not safe to entrust the government of the country to the influence of Wall Street.\\"Russel B. Nye, Midwestern Progressive Politics: A Historical Study of Its Origins and Development, 1870-1950 (1951) p 205 Death Pingree did not run for reelection in 1900. In 1901, Pingree arrived in London, England, while returning from an African safari with his son. He was stricken with peritonitis and was unable to return to the U.S. King Edward VII, Pingree‚Äôs famous look alike, even sent his own physicians to London's Grand Hotel to assist in Pingree's recovery. Pingree was interred at the Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan, and later reinterred at the Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit. There is a statue of Pingree standing in the Grand Circus Park in Detroit, commemorating him as \\"The Idol of the People.\\" The sculpture was made by Austrian sculptor Rudolph Schwarz. There is also a bronze bust of him on the thirteenth floor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Building in Detroit.

This cross cannot take place naturally. Fragaria √ó ananassa has eight sets of chromosomes whereas Fragaria vesca has only two sets. Repeated attempts to cross these resulted in sterile offspring. Researchers treated tissue from a Fragaria vesca plant with colchicine to create a mutant plant with four sets of chromosomes. This mutant was then crossed with a Fragaria √ó ananassa plant, and vigorous fertile offspring were obtained. The offspring were found to be decaploid, (having ten sets of chromosomes). Fragaria √ó vescana is not yet commercially important, but remains under development.

The stage name Stza is a tribute to the Wu-Tang Clan, in which the members would take their stage names from the Supreme Alphabet of the Five Percent Nation, such as GZA (God ZigZagZig Allah) and RZA (Ruler ZigZagZig Allah) - Stza's name would therefore be Self Truth ZigZagZig Allah. Early life Stza was raised in New York by his mother, who he classified as an \\"over-protective Jewish mom\\". He rarely saw his biological father, and his stepfather committed suicide. As a teenager, he dropped out of high school, ran away from home and began riding freight trains. Since the age of 16, Stza has been arrested several times, mainly for shoplifting. Music career In 1990, Stza and a friend of his, Alec Baillie, formed No Commercial Value, which later evolved into Choking Victim and then again into Left√∂ver Crack. Although many members of these bands have come and gone, Stza remained a constant figure, writing the vast majority of the lyrics and music and becoming the bands' self- appointed spokesperson. Stza is also associated with the band Morning Glory through Left√∂ver Crack member, Ezra Kire. In 2005, he collaborated with Mischief Brew on a song for their first album, Smash The Windows. In 2005, he played solo (doing acoustic shows) and in a new band, Crack Rock Steady Seven, featuring members of The Infested in Europe. 2006 saw him in Mexico City forming another regional Crack Rocksteady Seven, the CRS7mx featuring members of Ni√±o Zombi. In the fall of 2006 he returned to the United States and toured with Left√∂ver Crack, their tour with Citizen Fish was dubbed Cracktoberfest 2006. Most recently Stza has been involved in the creation of another punk/ska band, this time with members of Casa de Chihuahua, The Slackers, and The Degenerics (Nico do Gaillo, Ara Babajian and Frank Piegaro respectively) called \\"Star Fucking Hipsters\\". Star Fucking Hipsters' debut album was released September 30, 2008 on the Fat Wreck Chords label. Their second album, \\"Never Rest In Peace\\", was released on October 20, 2009 on the Alternative Tentacles label. Their new album, titled \\"From the Dumpster to the Grave\\" was released on October 11, 2011 on Fat Wreck Chords during a record release show at Europa in Brooklyn, New York. Personal life Stza, along with other members of Left√∂ver Crack, has at times resided at 155 Avenue C, better known as C-Squat. He is a vegetarian. He is also engaged to Whitney Flynn from Days N Daze.

In June 2016, Simcox was convicted of child sexual abuse and is serving a 19.5 year sentence. Minuteman Civil Defense Corps In October 2002, Simcox issued a public call to arms, inviting readers of his newspaper, the Tombstone Tumbleweed, to join a \\"Citizens Border Patrol Militia\\" whose function, Simcox said, would be to \\"shame the government into doing its job\\" of controlling the United States's border with Mexico. He founded Civil Homeland Defense, a group which patrolled the border, and within the next two and a half years sought to assist the United States Border Patrol. Simcox's practice of reporting illegal immigrants attempting to enter the country has been controversial, and questions concerning its legality have been raised. When Civil Homeland Defense was first formed, Simcox's opponents claimed that it is illegal for a normal citizen who is in no way affiliated with law enforcement to detain people in the United States. Simcox claimed at that time that these detentions were justified under a \\"citizen's arrest\\" policy.Max Blumenthal, \\"Vigilante injustice\\" , Salon, May 22, 2005. Accessed January 13, 2008. Since the inception of the MCDC, however, their \\"Standard Operating Procedure\\" (SOP) states that \\"Minutemen Observe, Report, Record, and Direct Border Patrol or other appropriate emergency or law enforcement agencies to suspected Illegal Aliens or Illegal Activities.\\"\\"Standard Operating Procedure for Minuteman Civil Defense Corps\\", retrieved January 13, 2008. In December 2004, Simcox teamed with James Gilchrist to organize the Minuteman Project, which brought nationwide attention to the southern border. Some have accused the Minuteman members of being vigilantes, but supporters claim that there has never been a case of a member of The Minuteman Project physically harming anyone. However, the former Border Operations Manager of The Minuteman Project, Shawna Forde, was convicted of double murder after leaving it to form a splinter group. The other organization Simcox headed, the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, was co-founded by J. T. Ready, a neo-Nazi who killed four before taking his own life. The group was dissolved in 2010, with its leader citing concerns of being held responsible should members fail to follow the proper \\"rules of engagement\\" on the border.http://www.sonorannews.com/archives/2010/100331/ftpgMinuteman.html Simcox was interviewed for the 2005 independent documentary Wetback: The Undocumented Documentary. Simcox also appeared in a 2006 documentary by Joseph Matthew and Dan DeVivo called \\"Crossing Arizona,\\" and a 2007 documentary by Chris Burgard called \\"Border\\". He has been featured as a guest on The Political Cesspool. On April 21, 2006, Simcox sent a message to President George W. Bush asking him to send National Guard troops to guard the border or the \\"Minutemen\\" would begin construction of a wall along the border, built on private property. Simcox has stated he does not receive a salary from Minutemen, and earns income via honoraria and fees received for speaking engagements. He claims to have sold his life story for a film that will soon go into production. During the period between his departure from the Minutemen and his arrest in 2013, Simcox worked for iMemories in Scottsdale, Arizona. Senate campaign Simcox announced he was stepping down from MCDC to challenge in the 2010 Republican primary the renomination of U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona. Former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth officially launched his bid on February 15, 2010, in Phoenix. His announcement led Simcox to drop his campaign and endorse Hayworth, saying that he wanted to present a \\"united conservative front\\". On his campaign website Simcox announced that he stepped down because \\"This race had quickly become bigger than what our family could manage\\" and \\"When JD Hayworth entered the race he was financially unable to continue.\\" Personal life Simcox was formerly a kindergarten teacher at the Wildwood School in Los Angeles, California, where he taught for thirteen years.

Child molestation conviction On June 19, 2013, Simcox was arrested by the Phoenix Police Department on multiple counts related to child molestation and sexual conduct with a minor. The arrest took place in Phoenix, Arizona and involved three girls under the age of 10 years, one of which was his own daughter.

Sometimes described as New Zealand thrushes, the piopios had only a coincidental, passing resemblance to the thrush family. Taxonomy and systematics Piopios were a long-standing taxonomic mystery. Until 2011, the IOC regarded their monotypic family Turnagridae as incertae sedis (of uncertain placement). The genus Turnagra was then placed in the family Oriolidae after it was determined that the piopios were closely related to the figbirds. They have been said to have more in common with the bowerbird family of Australia, but they differ in terms of nest construction, egg marking, and voice. A relationship has also been suggested with the whistlers (Pachycephalidae). The piopios were formerly considered to be a single species until split into separate North and South Island species in 2012. The specific names of both species were based on mistakes; Turnagra capensis was so named because Anders Sparrman mixed up his specimens and thought the bird had been collected in South Africa (capensis referring to the Cape of Good Hope). The North Island's Turnagra tanagra was so named because it was thought to be related to the tanagers of the Americas. The vernacular name is derived from the MƒÅori name, piopio-kata. =Extinct species= The genus Turnagra contains two extinct species: * ‚Ä†North Island piopio (Turnagra tanagra) * ‚Ä†South Island piopio (Turnagra capensis) Behaviour and ecology Little is known about their biology. They frequented the undergrowth and forest floor. Their nests were well constructed cups placed in trees a few metres from the ground, in which two to four eggs were laid. Walter Buller described their calls as being among the most beautiful of any New Zealand bird. They were also able to mimic the calls of other birds. They were omnivorous, with records of them hawking for insects over a river, as well as eating spiders, fruit and oats. Status Extensive deforestation throughout the country (particularly in the lowlands) and the introduction of mammalian predators, particularly rats, to North Island and South Island in the 19th century during the period of European settlement are believed to have caused the extinctions of both species. The last verified North Island piopio was shot in 1902, although poorly documented sightings were reported as late as the 1970s. The South Island piopio was last recorded in 1905.

Plot Diverging from the storyline of the comics, the series set Flash, Dale Arden and Dr. Zarkov in the year 3203. As agents of the Galactic Bureau of Investigation, the team travels the galaxy in their ship the Sky Flash, battling cosmic villains under the order of Commander Paul Richards. The series proved popular with American audiences and critical response, though sparse, was positive. Flash Gordon has garnered little modern critical attention. What little there is generally dismisses the series, although there has been some critical thought devoted to its presentation of Cold War and capitalist themes. Cast * Steve Holland as Flash Gordon * Irene Champlin as Dale Arden * Joseph Nash as Hans Zarkov Production =Development= Universal Studios had held the production rights to Flash Gordon but allowed them to lapse. Former Universal executives Edward Gruskin and Matty Fox struck a deal with Flash Gordon owners King Features Syndicate to produce the first 26 episodes of the series.Dixon, p. 97 The series was produced by Gruskin and Wenzel L√ºdecke.Dixon, p. 324 Writers for Flash Gordon included Gruskin, Bruce Geller and Earl Markham. Episodes were directed by Wallace Worsley, Jr. and Gunther von Fritsch. Composers Kurt Heuser and Roger Roger provided much of the original music. =Filming= Shooting began in May 1953, with an abandoned beer hall in Spandau serving as the principal shooting location.Dixon, p. 98 Among the cast and crew, only the lead actors and director Worsley spoke English. Worsley would recall the production difficulties this caused: > \\"No matter what galaxy we explored, everyone spoke with a German accent. The > use of German actors who could not speak English required us to use a lot of > close-ups. I would stand behind the camera, correctly positioned for the > actor's look, and read his or her line; the actor would then repeat the > line, mimicking my pronunciation and emphasis.\\"Worsley, p. 69; quoted in > Dixon, p. 98 The series was budgeted at USD $15,000 per episode on a three-day-per-episode shooting schedule. Citing salary disputes, Worsley withdrew from the project after completing the first 26 episodes. Production was moved to Marseille under the direction of Gunther von Fritsch for the 13 final episodes. At that time, producer Luedecke was replaced by American producer Edward Gruskin. =Locations= The series was filmed in West Berlin and Marseille as a West German, French and American co-production by Intercontinental Television Films and Telediffusion. =Broadcast= The series aired in syndication throughout most of the U.S. but also aired on the east coast on the DuMont Television Network.Cook, et al. p. 46 Episodes Critical response and themes Variety noted that the series was from a technical standpoint \\"up to the demands of the script and the average viewer probably won't notice the differences in quality between this and home-grown produce\\".quoted in Dixon, p. 98 Flash Gordon was immediately popular in the United States and continued to run in syndication into the early 1960s.Dixon, p. 100 Modern critical reaction to the series has been light but largely negative. The production values are frequently derided, with the series described as \\"bargain- basement\\".Bassoir, pg. 25 The televised series suffered in comparison to the earlier film serials with the television incarnation labeled \\"vastly inferior,\\" lacking \\"good concepts and scripts\\" and \\"most of all, [lacking] Buster Crabbe, who was Flash Gordon\\".Harmon, et al., p. 45 One positive comment notes Champlin's portrayal of Dale Arden, who was transformed from the typical damsel in distress of the serials into a trained scientist and a \\"quick thinker who often saved [Flash and Zarkov] from perishing\\".Terrace, p. 46 Film theorist Wheeler Winston Dixon, far from decrying the series for its production values, finds that \\"the copious [use of] stock footage and the numerous exterior sequences shot in the ruins of the bombed-out metropolis give Flash Gordon a distinctly ravaged look\\".Dixon, pp. 98‚Äì9 He writes that its international origins give the series \\"an interesting new cultural dimension, even a perceptible air of a split cultural identity\\". Dixon quotes German cultural historian Mark Baker, who writes of a particular scene from the episode The Brain Machine as emblematic of this cultural split. The scene uses stock footage of a June 17, 1953 demonstration by East Berlin workers against the East German government. Soviet tanks opened fire on both demonstrators and bystanders, thus confirming East Germany's status as a Soviet puppet state in the minds of West Germans. American viewers, Baker speculates, were probably unaware of the iconic power in West Germany of the images of fleeing East Berlinners, which were used to illustrate a panic on Neptune.Dixon, p. 99 Dixon, noting the similarities between the ideals espoused by \\"space operas\\" like Flash Gordon, Captain Video and Rocky Jones, Space Ranger and American Cold War values, argues that such series were designed to instill those values into their young viewers.Dixon, pp. 93‚Äì4 Flash Gordon, he writes, along with its fellow space operas, \\"have a common, unifying theme: peace in the universe can be achieved only by dangerous efforts and the unilateral dominance of the Western powers.\\" This echoes the earlier critique of Soviet writer G. Avarin, who in the Soviet film journal Art of the Cinema had accused Gordon and other space-faring characters of being \\"the vanguard of a new and greater 'American imperialism'\\". The \\"ravaged look\\" of the series, Dixon writes, \\"underscores the real-world stage on which the action of the space operas played\\". Preservation status Physical copies of two episodes, \\"Escape into Time\\" (October 8, 1954) and \\"The Witch of Neptune\\" (March 4, 1955), are held in the J. Fred MacDonald collection at the Library of Congress. A total of fourteen episodes are currently available in the public domain, both on various DVD releases and on websites such as the Internet Archive: Episodes 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 36, and 39.

The school had an estimated enrollment of approximately 2,300 students during the 2008‚Äì2009 school year, but was downsized with the opening of the new Lakeshore High School, which was opened with the 2009‚Äì2010 school year. 2009 enrollment for Fontainebleau is estimated to be about 1,650.http://fontainebleauhigh.stpsb.org/newsletter0909.pdf Fontainebleau's mascot is the Bulldog; the school's motto is Optimus Optimorum, a Latin saying meaning \\"The best of the best\\". Its school colors are red and black. The opening of Fontainebleau High School sparked controversy in much of the western and central areas of St. Tammany Parish. With a new attendance zone being so extensively large, the high school started out serving neighborhoods in Abita Springs, Mandeville, and even Covington and Lacombe, causing an aggressive amount of tension and violence in the early weeks of the opening of the school. Academics Fontainebleau High School is known for its academic excellence. It is recognized as being among the top public high schools in the state and was featured in the \\"America's Best High Schools\\" article in an issue of Business Week.http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/01/0115_best_schools/20.htm The school continually scores above local, state, and national averages on standardized tests.

In 2003, the marching band attended its first marching festival. During the 2005 season the Crimson Band was invited to the Louisiana Showcase of Marching Bands, the largest in the state despite missing a month of rehearsals due to Hurricane Katrina. In the Fall of 2006, the band placed 3rd overall at the Louisiana Showcase and 5th overall in the Fall of 2007. In 2008, the band was named the Reserve Grand Champion at the Louisiana Showcase of Marching Bands. In 2009, the band placed 3rd overall with their show, Carpe Noctum. In 2010, the band once again was named Reserve Grand Champion at Louisiana Showcase with the show City of Scandal: Love and the Mob. In 2011, October 29, the Fontainebleau Crimson Band once again won Reserve Grand Champion at the Louisiana Showcase of Marching Bands, falling short of Lafayette High School by only 2¬Ω points.

Topology 25 (1), 85‚Äì110. which he formulated together with Daniel Quillen, and which has since found applications in index theory and topological quantum field theory. He was appointed a full professor in 2006. He was appointed Director of the Institute for Geometry and its Applications in 2009. In 2011, he was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. In 2013, he was appointed the (Sir Thomas) Elder Professor of Mathematics at the University of Adelaide, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of South Australia. In 2017, he was awarded an ARC Australian Laureate Fellowship. Biography Mathai received a BA at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He then proceeded to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was awarded a doctorate under the supervision of Daniel Quillen, a Fields Medallist. Mathai's work is in the area of geometric analysis. His research interests are in L^2 analysis, index theory and noncommutative geometry. He currently works on mathematical problems that have their roots in physics, for example, topological field theories, fractional quantum Hall effect, and D-branes in the presence of B-fields. The main focus of his research is on the application of noncommutative geometry and index theory to mathematical physics, with particular emphasis on string theory. His current work on index theory is ongoing joint work with Richard Melrose and Isadore Singer, on the fractional analytic index and on the index theorem for projective families of elliptic operators. His current work on string theory is ongoing joint work with Peter Bouwknegt, Jarah Evslin, Keith Hannabuss and Jonathan Rosenberg, on T-duality in the presence of background flux.Bouwknegt, Peter, Evslin, Jarah and Mathai, Varghese. (2004) \\"T-duality: Topology Change from H-flux\\". Communications in Mathematical Physics 249 (2), 383‚Äì415. The Mathai‚ÄìQuillen formalism appeared in Topology shortly after Mathai completed his Ph.D. Using the superconnection formalism of Quillen, they obtained a refinement of the Riemann‚ÄìRoch formula, which links together the Thom classes in K-theory and cohomology, as an equality on the level of differential forms. This has an interpretation in physics as the computation of the classical and quantum (super) partition functions for the fermionic analogue of a harmonic oscillator with source term. In particular, they obtained a nice Gaussian shape representative of the Thom class in cohomology, which has a peak along the zero section. Its universal representative is obtained using the machinery of equivariant differential forms. Mathai was awarded the Australian Mathematical Society Medal in 2000. From August 2000 to August 2001, he was also a Clay Mathematics Institute Research Fellow and Visiting Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From March to June 2006, he was a senior research fellow at the Erwin Schr√∂dinger Institute in Vienna. Selected publications * * Bouwknegt, Peter, Evslin, Jarah and Mathai, Varghese.

Marine Park consists of recreational park areas and the Salt Marsh Nature Center, where myrtle warblers, grasshopper sparrows, cottontail rabbits, ring-necked pheasants, horseshoe crabs, and oyster toadfish can be found. History Marine Park's Salt Marsh Nature Center The area was a hunting and fishing ground for Native Americans from the nearby village of Keshawchqueren. Pits for cooking and preparing food dating from 800 to 1400 AD were uncovered in Marine Park, along with deer and turtle bones, oyster shells, and sturgeon scales. In the 17th century, the Dutch began to settle in the area, which had similarities to the marshland and coastal plains of the Netherlands. The land proved to be fairly good farmland and there was an abundance of clams, oysters, and game from the region as well. In the early 20th century, as industrialization swept the nation, developers made plans to turn Jamaica Bay into a port and prepared to dredge Rockaway Inlet to allow large ships into the proposed harbor. Speculators anticipated a real estate boom and bought land along the Jamaica Bay waterfront. However, donors including Alfred Tredway White and Frederic Pratt turned the land over to the city, with the requirement that it become parkland. Development was slow, but with new land purchases, the park grew to by 1937. That same year, the Board of Aldermen named the site \\"Brooklyn Marine Park\\". Tree lines in the park The salt and fresh water mixture of the nature preserve and trail on the park land has had its own history. In the 18th century, George Washington made a stop for several days on the land nearby. There was a gristmill on the water at the time; in 1938, the mill burned down to the water level, leaving only the low tide wood pilings across the water that can be seen to this day. In the mid-20th century, the area was abused by trash and abandoned cars. At one point, it became a landfill, and trash piled to in certain areas. After a massive cleanup effort in the 1990s, the area was restored to its former glory, with exception of a few rusty car parts riddling the area and teens littering and causing arson to the dry tall Phragmites from time to time. The park gained its land mass as a dump, leading to so many rats in the area that local children hunted them with bows and arrows in the 1960s. One neighborhood boy was bitten by a rat in his sleep. Carmine Carro Community Center Recreational facilities were built in the decades to follow, including the Pratt-White athletic field (1939) that was dedicated to the two fathers of Marine Park. A golf course opened in 1963, and the John V. Lindsay Model Airport was dedicated in 1971. The golf course was designed by renowned course architect Robert Trent Jones and hosts several pro-am golf tournaments, including the Brooklyn Open and the Jamaica Open NY Golf Tournament. New ballfields were opened in 1979 and named for baseball-loving NYPD Officer Rocco Torre in 1997. Nature trails established along Gerritsen Creek in 1984-85 invite parkgoers to observe a wealth of flora and fauna. Ongoing improvements at the end of the 20th century include the reconstruction of basketball, tennis, and bocce courts; of baseball fields; and of Lenape Playground at Avenue U. A new nature center opened in 2000, and the Carmine Carro Community Center opened in 2013.  Facilities  The park's playground, several sports fields, and 0.83 mile-long running path were all built on the ancient Keshawchqueren burial ground. Part of the park, including the fields north of Avenue U, were built atop Gerritsen Creek. Marine Park also contains a golf course, which occupies the park's eastern half. The golf course opened in 1963 and contains a driving range.  Geographical features  Marine Park contains most of the remaining length of Gerritsen Creek. The head of the creek is located adjacent to the Salt Marsh Nature Center. The creek's headwaters originally were located eight avenues north of its current source at Avenue U, but the northern part of the creek was buried in a storm sewer in 1920. The creek has been described as one of the \\"fingers\\" that formed the original shoreline of Jamaica Bay. Mau Mau Island, also called White Island, is an artificial island within the park, located between two branches of Gerritsen Creek. Created possibly by 1934, it was made out of garbage. It was supposed to be included within an expansion of the golf course, which was never built; a temporary bridge was the only object erected from this plan, and only the footers from this bridge remain. The eastern part of Marine Park, to the east of Mau Mau Island, was originally part of an island called Riches Meadows. The island was bounded by two creeks, Mill Creek and Deep Creek, which then led to Mill Basin, located across Flatbush Avenue to the northeast. Community center The Carmine Carro Community Center, named for Carmine Carro, a local activist and park advocate who served as president for the Marine Park Civic Association, opened in March 2013. The building's ‚Äúgreen‚Äù elements include solar panels, a geothermal heating and cooling system, and a green roof. Because of these energy-saving features, the Parks Department is seeking LEED Silver certification for the building.

Those individuals were targeted to be euthanized by the state, usually through the compulsion or deception of their caretakers. The term included people with serious medical problems and those considered grossly inferior according to the racial policy of Nazi Germany. This concept formed an important component of the ideology of Nazism and eventually helped lead to the Holocaust.http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust- history.org/lifton/LiftonT021.shtml The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide] by Dr. Robert Jay Lifton (holocaust-history.org) It is similar to but more restrictive than the concept of \\"Untermensch\\", subhumans, as not all \\"subhumans\\" were considered unworthy of life (Slavs, for instance, were deemed useful for slave labor). The euthanasia program was officially adopted in 1939 and came through the personal decision of Adolf Hitler. It grew in extent and scope from Aktion T4 ending officially in 1941 when public protests stopped the program, through the Action 14f13 against concentration camp inmates. The euthanasia of certain cultural and religious groups and those with physical and mental disabilities continued more discreetly until the end of World War II. The methods used initially at German hospitals such as lethal injections and bottled gas poisoning were expanded to form the basis for the creation of extermination camps where the gas chambers were built from scratch to conduct the extermination of the Jews, Romani, communists, anarchists, and political dissidents.The Gypsies of Eastern Europe, David Crowe, John Kolsti, Ian Hancock, Routledge, 22 Jul 2016, pg31Henry Friedlander (1995), History The expression first appeared in print via the title of a 1920 book, Die Freigabe der Vernichtung Lebensunwerten Lebens (Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life) by two professors, the jurist Karl Binding (retired from the University of Leipzig) and psychiatrist Alfred Hoche from the University of Freiburg.Cover of Die Freigabe der Vernichtung Lebensunwerten Lebens (Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life) at German wikipedia. According to Hoche, some living people who were brain damaged, intellectually disabled, autistic (though not recognized as such at the time), and psychiatrically ill were \\"mentally dead\\", \\"human ballast\\" and \\"empty shells of human beings\\". Hoche believed that killing such people was useful. Some people were simply considered disposable.Dr S D Stein, \\"Life Unworthy of Life\\" and other Medical Killing Programmes. UWE Faculty of Humanities, Languages, and Social Science ‚Äì via Internet Archive. Later the killing was extended to people considered 'racially impure' or 'racially inferior' according to Nazi thinking. The concept culminated in Nazi extermination camps, instituted to systematically kill those who were unworthy to live according to Nazi ideologists. It also justified various human experimentation and eugenics programs, as well as Nazi racial policies. Development of the concept This poster (from around 1938) reads: \\"60,000 Reichsmark is what this person suffering from a hereditary defect costs the People's community during his lifetime. Fellow citizen, that is your money too. Read '[A] New People', the monthly magazine of the Bureau for Race Politics of the NSDAP.\\" According to the author of Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, the policy went through a number of iterations and modifications: See also * Nazi concentration camp badges * Holocaust victims * Department of Film (Nazi Germany) * Glossary of Nazi Germany: Useless eaters * Nazi eugenics * Nazism and race * Sagamihara stabbings * Social cleansing References External links * \\"Life Unworthy of Life\\" and other Medical Killing Programmes by Dr. Stuart D.

However, the JLA are able to escape all the dangers on the worlds and return to Earth using a dimensional traveler one of Despero's henchmen possesses after the Flash defeats him. Despero has found the rebel and plans to use the energy-absorbing weapon they hoped to use to disable his weapons to conquer Earth, but Snapper Carr uses it to weaken the villain after pretending he has been hypnotized, though the 'blue glow' protected him.

Despero is also empowered by the \\"Flame of Py'tar\\", a mystical source of power that grants him massive superhuman strength, durability, speed, reflexes and the ability to alter his biomass (from human-sized to massive, even reintegrating himself molecule by molecule). However his power varies based on the psionic energy he wields; for example, through the complete flame of Py'tar he once had the ability to manipulate reality to a degree, creating monsters and demons out of an earthen city. Otherwise without it, he has still repeatedly been shown to be more powerful than Kryptonians, Amazons, Hourman and even Captain Marvel. Other versions =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In the comics, Despero is only shown for a brief period of time. He crashes into Earth, going through an office building which kills several people. Sinestro chases after him, exclaiming that he will not allow Despero to harm anyone. Despero responds in anger, telling him that ‚ÄòIt was that damn corps of yours‚Äô that brought him down. Sinestro uses his powers and places Despero's hands on his neck, feigning a struggle. Sinestro snaps Despero's neck using his yellow ring in front of Hal Jordan and Jon Stewart, saying he had no choice. Despero is not mentioned or seen again in the comics. In other media =Television= Animation * Despero appears in the Justice League episode \\"Hearts and Minds\\" voiced by Keith David. In this incarnation, Despero is a native of the harsh desert planet of Kalanor. Born with a third eye, he was an outcast. In his travels through the desert, he stumbled upon the Flame of Py'tar, which gave him the ability to control the minds of others and project powerful energy blasts that could overpower Green Lanterns. He built up an army of followers empowered by the Py'tar, defeated several members of the Green Lantern Corps, and threatened to spread his fanatical crusade across the galaxy. It is eventually discovered that the Flame of Py'tar is actually the dormant life-force of Kalanor. Martian Manhunter allows it to speak through his body, thereby exposing Despero as a fraud while releasing the Py'tar. The Py'tar then spread its power across Kalanor, seeding it with lush vegetation. Despero's followers traveling the universe are transformed into trees that fall to the nearby planets. While Despero himself is dragged underground never to be seen again, his last words are, \\"Oh Py'tar, now I see... paradise!\\". * Despero appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Eyes of Despero!\\" voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. This version has eyes on the palms of his hands in addition to the third eye on his head. He plans to overthrow and destroy the Green Lantern Corps by hypnotizing its members into becoming his army. When he succeeds in corrupting a large number of Lanterns, Hal Jordan apparently sacrifices them and himself. Despero alters his plan, corrupting Mogo so as to use his vast power to brainwash entire worlds in an instant. Batman, summoned by Hal's ring, as well as Green Lanterns Guy Gardner, Sinestro, and G'nort, band together to free Mogo and defeat Despero. Once Mogo is freed, he shoots a rock which knocks out Despero. In \\"Duel of the Double Crossers!\\", Batman makes the Outsiders fight Despero in Metropolis in a simulation. * Despero appears in the Young Justice: Invasion episode \\"Cornered\\". This version is a gladiator who arrives on Earth to prove himself as the greatest warrior in 93 Star Systems. He does not fly or talk and lets his majordomo L-Ron speak for him. Despero traps the Hall of Justice in a forcefield, puts Zatanna in a trance in order to stick to hand-to-hand combat, and attacks Captain Marvel and Superboy. When Captain Marvel is regressed back to Billy Batson, Despero puts him in a trance and defeats Superboy. When Despero attempts to take Superboy's head, Bumblebee stalls him, but ends up in a trance. In the nick of time, Mal Duncan appears in Guardian's costume and keeps Despero busy while Superboy and Miss Martian come up with a plan to stop him. Miss Martian awakens Zatanna and redirects Despero's powers against him, allowing Superboy to knock him out. Captain Atom later mentions that Despero is in the custody of the Reach. In \\"The Hunt\\", Despero was seen with Mongul and The Team in the Warworld's stasis cells. Live-action An alien that recalls Despero appears in the background of one of the DEO monitors in the pilot episode of the Supergirl series, likely referring to Despero. =Film= Despero appears in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies.

He was with The Economist for seven years before joining WIRED magazine in 2001, where he was the editor-in-chief until 2012. He is known for his 2004 article entitled The Long Tail; which he later expanded into the 2006 book, The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More. He is the cofounder and current CEO of 3D Robotics, a drone manufacturing company. Life and work =Early life= Anderson was born in London. His family moved to the United States, when he was five. He enrolled for a degree program in physics from George Washington University and went on to study quantum mechanics and science journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. He later did research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. =Career= He began his career with a six-year period as editor at the two scientific journals, Nature and Science. He then joined The Economist in 1994, where he remained for seven years, during which time he was stationed in London, Hong Kong and New York City in various positions, ranging from Technology Editor to US Business Editor. He took over as editor of WIRED in 2001. Chris Anderson speaking in Boalt Hall at UC Berkeley. His 2004 article The Long Tail in WIRED was expanded into a book in 2006, titled, The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More. It appeared on The New York Times Nonfiction Best Sellers list. The book argues that products in low demand or that have a low sales volume can collectively build a better market share than its rivals, or exceed the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, provided the store or distribution channel is large enough. The book earned Anderson the 2007 Gerald Loeb Award for Business Book. His next book, entitled Free: The Future of a Radical Price (2009) examines the advantages of a strategy where products and services are initially given to customers for free, and how businesses can profit more in the long run. Anderson was accused of plagiarizing content from English wikipedia for his book. Anderson responded that he had disagreements with the criticism, and reasoned that the mention of citations were avoided due to the changing nature of content in English wikipedia. However, the whole episode led him to integrate footnotes into the text, and the digital editions of Free were corrected with the revision. Free debuted as #12 on The New York Times Best Seller List. It was also available as a free download for a limited time, and an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 digital copies were downloaded in the first two weeks. The unabridged audiobook remains free. Anderson's third book, Makers: The New Industrial Revolution (2012), was based on his 2010 article, \\"Atoms Are the New Bits\\". The book describes how entrepreneurs are using open source design, and 3D printing as a platform for driving resurgence of American manufacturing. The ideas he portrayed; such as crowdsourcing of ideas, utilization of available lower-cost design and manufacturing tools, and reviewing options to outsource capital-intensive manufacturing were highlighted in the February 2012 Harvard Business Review article, \\"From Do It Yourself to Do It Together\\". Anderson was featured and interviewed on The Amp Hour radio show in episode #105 ‚Äì An Interview with Chris Anderson ‚Äì Deambulatory Daedal Drones, where he discusses his career, books, and the hardware and drone industry. =Ventures= In 2007, Anderson founded GeekDad, a do-it-yourself blog that later became part of Wired.com. He was the editor until the role was handed over to Ken Denmead, and he now serves as editor emeritus of GeekDad. The same year, Anderson founded Booktour.com, a free online service that connected authors on tour with audiences. In September 2011, Booktour.com folded. In October 2007, Anderson, who has been described as an \\"aerial-reconnaissance enthusiast,\\" flew a remote-controlled aircraft allegedly equipped with a camera over Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, causing security concerns when the aircraft crashed into a tree. The enthusiasm turned inspiration for co- founding 3D Robotics, a 2009 robotics manufacturing spin-off of the DIYdrones.comDIYdrones.com online community. 3D Robotics produces the Ardupilot series of autopilots, which are based on the Arduino platform. In May 2007, Anderson was featured as one of the top 100 thinkers in Time Magazine's annual list for 2007. Personal life Anderson currently lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife and five children. He met his wife while working at the scientific journal, Nature. He has dual U.S.-U.K. citizenship.

One of the cast was Irish-born American actor James O'Hara, Maureen O'Hara's brother. Plot Joanna Dane (Maureen O'Hara) is sent to Tangiers to get information on, and close down, an international smuggling ring. Dane is adept at jiu jitsu, firearms, and wisecracks that she uses on anyone who tangles with her. Her beauty, attractive outfits and skill with playing cards get her a position as a croupier at a smuggler's hangout called Frisco's, run by the hard blonde Frisco (Binnie Barnes). Joanna also is pursued by smuggler Van Logan (MacDonald Carey), who she uses by having him take her to Ali Baba's, a parfumerie run by the suspicious Mustapha (Ferdy Mayne). During her work at Frisco's, Joanna is pestered by Danny Boy (James Lilburn), Logan's Irish assistant, who ignores her insults and warnings to let her alone. When the embarrassed Danny Boy threatens Joanna, she grabs him and throws him to the floor. Augie (Harry Lane) ‚Äì another target of Joanna's surveillance‚Äîbeats Danny Boy's head with his cane, knocking him unconscious. Logan fights with Augie, revealing he carries a sword cane by tossing the blade at Logan. Joanna accompanies Logan, Danny Boy and his crew on their boat the Banshee to smuggle goods into Spain where they are hijacked by a boat led by Augie. The Banshee manages to escape but without their cargo. Logan is arrested by the Civil Guard but manages to escape with Augie unsuccessfully attempting to assassinate Joanna. Joanna tracks down the smuggling ring, shooting Logan and discovering the real head of the smuggling ring, who she has the Civil Guard eliminate.

Keetman was responsible for most of the actual teaching that was done in the early stages of the movement, perhaps most prominently as the teacher for the radio and television broadcasts that popularized the Schulwerk throughout Germany in the 1950s. As a young woman, Keetman was unsure of herself and of her calling in life.Gray, Esther. ‚ÄúGlimpses at Genius: Keetman the Person, the Composer, the Teacher.‚Äù Orff Echo, Vol. 37 (2005): 9-10. doi: MAH0001448655. In her twenties, however, she came under the ideals and music instruction of Dorothee G√ºnther and Carl Orff at the G√ºntherschule in Munich, Germany.O‚ÄôHenir, Martha and Carol Erion. ‚ÄúKeetman Centenary.‚Äù Orff Echo, Vol. 37 (2005): 1. doi: MAH0001448654. This event helped Keetman to truly find herself, and she flourished in this environment. She began to teach at the G√ºntherschule after being a pupil for many years; however, the school was destroyed by a bombing in Munich when Keetman was in her early 40s. At that point, she and Carl Orff began the development of the Orff Schulwerk approach, for which she is best known today. Life =Early years= Gunild Keetman was born in Germany in 1904 to parents who seriously cultivated music and made sure it was an integral part of their daughter‚Äôs life.Keetman, Gunild. Discovering Keetman: rhythmic exercises and pieces for xylophone. New York: Schott, 1998. Her parents also expected her to get a full education, which included study at the university level. Despite the turbulent times of World War I and the unfortunate restraints placed upon women, she went to the University of Bonn in 1923. She then transferred to the University of Berlin the following year, but that did not work out well either. After struggling for a few years, she finally made what would become a pivotal decision in her life: she enrolled in the G√ºntherschule in Munich in 1926.Pruett, David B. ‚ÄúOrff Before Orff: The G√ºntherschule (1924-1945).‚Äù Journal of Historical Research in Music Education, Vol. 24, No. 2 (2003): 178-196. doi: 40215266. Carl Orff and Dorothee G√ºnther opened this school in 1924 in Munich to protest the German version of Victorianism then rampant.Shamrock, Mary. ‚ÄúOrff-Schulwerk: An Integrated Foundation.‚Äù Music Educators Journal, Vol. 83, No. 6 (1997): 41-44. The G√ºntherschule employed modern dance to provoke a protest, combining rejection, discovery, and idealism. It was here that Keetman finally found where she belonged and what she wanted to do with her life. She became fully invested in the school. In fact, she would spend the next 18 years of her life learning, and then eventually teaching at the school. =Teaching= In 1945, when Keetman was 41, the G√ºntherschule was destroyed in an Allied air raid. Keetman and the other members of the school were lost. For years, this establishment had been all they had known, and it was now gone. Keetman stated, ‚ÄúWe had our recorders with us; we could not do anything but make music together. In that moment, we played out our entire misery and sadness. I believe that when we finally stopped playing, we had played ourselves a little courage.‚Äù7\\\\. Sitzman, Ann. ‚ÄúThrough Technical Mastery and Composition, Keetman Re-Imagined the Recorder.‚Äù Orff Echo, Vol. 37 (2005): 18-20. doi: MAH0001448656.

After successfully broadcasting over radio, television, and records, the approach was becoming a success.Hughes, Patricia W. ‚ÄúThe Evolution of Orff Schulwerk in North America (1955-1969).‚Äù The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education, Vol. 14, No. 2 (1993): 73-91. doi: 40214811.

Germany: Schott‚Äôs Sohne, 1960. It was also during this decade that Keetman turned her focus to training teachers at the Orff Schulwerk headquarters in Salzburg.

Keetman strongly believe that play is essential to learning, and therefore gave students the opportunity to create anew within the wide boundary of her compositions. She also wrote works for the recorder, as this is another key instrument in the Orff Schulwerk approach. It was one of her most beloved instruments to play personally, and she did so throughout her years at the G√ºntherschule. She later applied what she learned there to compose works for Orff Schulwerk.

The film featured performances by Richard Hell, Talking Heads, Television, Patti Smith and Wayne County. Rolling Stone named it number 6 on its list of 25 Greatest Punk Rock Movies of All Time. He is also associated with the birth of No Wave Cinema due to films such as The Foreigner (1978), featuring Eric Mitchell, Debbie Harry, Anya Phillips; and Subway Riders (1981), Subway Riders :: River Lights Pictures starring Susan Tyrrell, Robbie Coltrane and Cookie Mueller.Curley, Mallory. A Cookie Mueller Encyclopedia, Randy Press, 2010. During this time he was also the director of the Public-access television cable TV show TV Party hosted by Glenn O'Brien and Chris Stein. He is part of the Remodernist film movement, which he described as the next development of Postmodernist and the transformation of existing cultural features, but \\"using the technology and the sensibility of contemporary rather than nostalgia\\".Bremer, Erin (April 2008). \\"New York Observers\\" , City Magazine, pp. 42‚Äì43. Retrieved 2010-02-01. Also on amospoe.com . \\"My idea of my work's importance is to see how it moves the culture to where I'd like to see it,\\" Poe said in a 1981 interview. In 2008, he wrote the screenplay for the 2008 Amy Redford film The Guitar. The New York Times reported in 2020 that Poe had lost all ownership of several of his groundbreaking films, including The Blank Generation, to Ivan Kral in a 2012 lawsuit over profits from licensing fees for showings of the film. Thereafter, Kral billed himself as the director of the film, demoting Poe to co-editor; Kral also acquired ownership, for $10 each, of Poe's films Unmade Beds, The Foreigner, Subway Riders, and Empire II. In late 2019, shortly before Kral's death, at a screening of The Blank Generation, it was revealed that Kral, or his wife, Cindy Hudson, had changed the ending of the film, switching out the original ending (depicting Patti Smith Group guitarist Lenny Kaye), for a brief biopic about Kral, followed with the credit \\"directed by Cindy Hudson.\\" Although the theater screening the film had, apparently unknowingly, marketed it as the iconic 1976 work, it was a considerably different film, and Poe's name was excised entirely.

Taxonomy and systematics The South Island piopio was originally described in the genus Tanagra (a synonym for Tangara) and subsequently classified by some authorities in the genus Turdus. For a long time the South Island piopio was considered conspecific with the North Island piopio that dwelt in New Zealand's North Island as the piopio, but later they were recognised as two distinct species due to pronounced differences in external appearance and osteology (Olson et al., 1983). Based on their smaller size, the description of the Stephens Island piopio was sometimes thought to be based on juvenile birds, but is now considered to be valid (Medway, 2004b). The assumption of a well-flying bird evolving into a distinct subspecies on the small (2.6 km2) island close (3.2 km) to the mainland seems hard to believe, but Stephens Island must have held a population of many hundred birds in 1894 (Medway, 2004a), and the piopio was apparently a reluctant flyer, not usually being found on offshore islands. =Subspecies= Two subspecies are recognized: * ‚Ä†T. c. capensis - (Sparrman, 1787): Formerly found in the South Island (of New Zealand) * Stephens Island piopio (‚Ä†T. c. minor) - Fleming, JH, 1915: Formerly found on Stephens Island (New Zealand) Description This medium-sized bird was mostly olive-brown in colouration, with rufous wings and tail, and a speckled breast. The Stephens Island piopio was much smaller than the nominate race. The South Island piopio was considered to be one of the best song birds native to New Zealand. Behaviour and ecology Photo of a T. c. capensis nest South Island piopios were omnivorous, and relatively unafraid of humans, as they have been recorded as taking scraps of food from campers. Lice of the genus Brueelia were found on the South Island piopio (Palma, 1999). Status The South Island piopio was once considered common in undergrowth forests of New Zealand's South Island, until 1863 when the population began to decline. The piopio continued to decline rapidly throughout the 1880s, mainly due to predation by cats and rats introduced to the island by humans, and some habitat destruction. By 1888 the bird was said to be the rarest in all of New Zealand, and by 1905 it was considered virtually extinct. The last confirmed specimen was shot at Oharu in 1902, although alleged sightings continued. For example, unconfirmed South Island piopio records exist from near Patea in 1923, between Gisborne and Wairoa on 7 May 1947, in Nelson district, January 1948 (all in Allison et al., 1949), and on 17 December 1947, at Lake Hauroko (Dunckley & Todd, 1949). The last supposed sighting was in 1963. =Stephens Island subspecies= The Stephens Island population became extinct, apparently in 1897, due to predation by feral cats which had multiplied to number in the hundreds by that time (see also Lyall's wren for a detailed chronology). The last specimen was taken on January 7, 1897, and there were none left by the end of 1898 (Medway, 2004a). Only 12 specimens of the Stephens Island bird exist today: * Staatliches Museum Dresden 16657, 16658, 16659, 16660, 16661; five spirit specimens purchased from Walter Buller's collection, received in 1899, * Natural History Museum, London 1903.12.10.2.; a female skin purchased from W.

The neural gas is a simple algorithm for finding optimal data representations based on feature vectors. The algorithm was coined \\"neural gas\\" because of the dynamics of the feature vectors during the adaptation process, which distribute themselves like a gas within the data space. It is applied where data compression or vector quantization is an issue, for example speech recognition, image processing or pattern recognition. As a robustly converging alternative to the k-means clustering it is also used for cluster analysis. Algorithm Given a probability distribution P(x) of data vectors x and a finite number of feature vectors w_i, i = 1,\\\\cdots,N. With each time step t, a data vector x randomly chosen from P(x) is presented. Subsequently, the distance order of the feature vectors to the given data vector x is determined. Let i_0 denote the index of the closest feature vector, i_1 the index of the second closest feature vector, and i_{N-1} the index of the feature vector most distant to x. Then each feature vector is adapted according to w_{i_k}^{t+1} = w_{i_k}^{t} + \\\\varepsilon\\\\cdot e^{-k/\\\\lambda}\\\\cdot (x-w_{i_k}^{t}), k = 0, \\\\cdots, N-1 with \\\\varepsilon as the adaptation step size and \\\\lambda as the so-called neighborhood range. \\\\varepsilon and \\\\lambda are reduced with increasing t. After sufficiently many adaptation steps the feature vectors cover the data space with minimum representation error.http://wwwold.ini.rub.de/VDM/research/gsn/JavaPaper/img187.gif The adaptation step of the neural gas can be interpreted as gradient descent on a cost function. By adapting not only the closest feature vector but all of them with a step size decreasing with increasing distance order, compared to (online) k-means clustering a much more robust convergence of the algorithm can be achieved. The neural gas model does not delete a node and also does not create new nodes. Variants A number of variants of the neural gas algorithm exists in the literature so as to mitigate some of its shortcomings. More notable is perhaps Bernd Fritzke's growing neural gas, but also one should mention further elaborations such as the Growing When Required network and also the incremental growing neural gas.. A performance-oriented approach that avoids the risk of overfitting is the Plastic Neural gas model . = Growing neural gas = Fritzke describes the growing neural gas (GNG) as an incremental network model that learns topological relations by using a \\"Hebb- like learning rule\\", only, unlike the neural gas, it has no parameters that change over time and it is capable of continuous learning, i.e. learning on data streams. GNG has been widely used in several domains, demonstrating its capabilities for clustering data incrementally. The GNG is initialized with two randomly positioned nodes which are initially connected with a zero age edge and whose errors are set to 0. Since the in the GNG input data is presented sequentially one by one, the following steps are followed at each iteration: * It is calculated the errors (distances) between the two closest nodes to the current input data. * The error of the winner node (only the closest one) is respectively accumulated. * The winner node and its topological neighbors (connected by an edge) are moving towards the current input by different fractions of their respective errors. * The age of all edges connected to the winner node are incremented. * If the winner node and the second-winner are connected by an edge, such an edge is set to 0. If case there are created, an edge is created between them. * If there are edges with an age larger than a threshold, they are removed. Nodes without connections are eliminated. * If the current iteration is an integer multiple of a predefined frequency-creation threshold, a new node is inserted between the node with the largest error (among all) and its topological neighbor presenting the highest error. The link between the former and the latter nodes is eliminated (their errors are decreased by a given factor) and the new node is connected to both of them. The error of the new node is initialized as the updated error of the node which had the largest error (among all). * The accumulated error of all nodes is decreased by a given factor. * If the stopping criterion is not met, the algorithm takes a following input. The criterion might be a given number of epochs, i.e., a pre-set number of times where all data is presented, or the reach of a maximum number of nodes. = Incremental growing neural gas = Another neural gas variant inspired in the GNG algorithm is the incremental growing neural gas (IGNG). The authors propose the main advantage of this algorithm to be \\"learning new data (plasticity) without degrading the previously trained network and forgetting the old input data (stability).\\" = Growing when required = Having a network with a growing set of nodes, like the one implemented by the GNG algorithm was seen as a great advantage, however some limitation on the learning was seen by the introduction of the parameter Œª, in which the network would only be able to grow when iterations were a multiple of this parameter. The proposal to mitigate this problem was a new algorithm, the Growing When Required network (GWR), which would have the network grow more quickly, by adding nodes as quickly as possible whenever the network identified that the existing nodes would not describe the input well enough. = Plastic neural gas = The ability to only grow a network may quickly introduce overfitting; on the other hand, removing nodes on the basis of age only, as in the GNG model, does not ensure that the removed nodes are actually useless, because removal depends on a model parameter that should be carefully tuned to the \\"memory length\\" of the stream of input data. The \\"Plastic Neural Gas\\" model solves this problem by making decisions to add or remove nodes using an unsupervised version of cross-validation, which controls an equivalent notion of \\"generalization ability\\" for the unsupervised setting.  Implementations  To find the ranking i_0, i_1, \\\\ldots, i_{N-1} of the feature vectors, the neural gas algorithm involves sorting, which is a procedure that does not lend itself easily to parallelization or implementation in analog hardware. However, implementations in both parallel software and analog hardware were actually designed. References Further reading * T. Martinetz, S. Berkovich, and K.

It generally incorporates fast rhythms, melodic and often distorted guitar riffs, and vocal styles tending towards shouting and screaming. Nevertheless, the genre has been very diverse, with different bands showcasing very different styles. Many pioneering melodic hardcore bands (such as Bad Religion and Descendents), have proven influential across the spectrum of punk rock, as well as rock music more generally. The term \\"melodic punk\\" is often used to describe both melodic hardcore and skate punk bands. Characteristics Melodic hardcore is broadly defined, however generally incorporates fast rhythms, melodic and often distorted guitar riffs, and vocal styles tending towards shouting and screaming. Many notable bands, such as Dag Nasty and Lifetime use minor interval chords on guitar, such as minor ninth and seventh chords, as well as fifth or ninth harmonies on vocals. Many groups also drop tune their instruments. Tempos commonly range from 180 to 210 beats per minute, with very few bands ranging outside of a 4/4 time signature. Many modern melodic hardcore bands are incorporating elements of melodic hardcore and emo, relying more heavily upon melody than their hardcore punk predecessors. There are also bands take influence from post-hardcore and melodic metalcore. As modern melodic hardcore diverges into one more metalcore leaning track as well as one more emotive track, terms such as \\"melodic emotive hardcore\\" and \\"melodic metallic hardcore\\" have been suggested to distinguish modern melodic hardcore bands with different sounds that still fall into the same genre. Bands such as the Ghost Inside, Blood Youth, Climates, and Hundredth, have been described as both metalcore and melodic hardcore while While She Sleeps is also considered as merging melodic hardcore elements with metalcore. Casey, La Dispute and Being as an Ocean, who are active in the modern melodic hardcore scene, incorporate elements of post- rock/post-black metal and/or spoken word into their music. History Descendents were a key influence on both melodic hardcore and pop punk in the 1980s. = Original development (1980s‚Äì1990s) = The earliest melodic hardcore emerged from the Californian hardcore punk scene by the early 1980s. This includes Descendents, who formed in 1978. Their earliest work was simple, pop-influenced punk rock, but they went on to mix this melodic approach with hardcore, inspiring both melodic hardcore and pop punk groups.\\"Descendents were the model for all 'melodic' HC that followed.\\" Blush, Steven and Petros, George; American Hardcore: A Tribal History; Los Angeles: Feral House: Distributed by Publishers Group West, 2001. . Part Two. \\"LA: How Could Hell Be Any Worse?\\" p. 79. Bad Religion, who formed in Los Angeles in 1979, played in a somewhat similar vein, but their approach was more \\"angry\\" and politically charged.Peter Jandreus, The Encyclopedia of Swedish Punk 1977‚Äì1987, Stockholm: Premium Publishing, 2008, p. 11. They recorded their debut album, How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, in 1981. The Faith's 1983 EP Subject to Change is thought of as one of the first melodic hardcore records, as significant as the music of Bad Religion or the Descendents. On the release, the band added and moved away from the more straightforward hardcore punk of their earlier work towards a more complex, textured, and melodic sound, accompanied by introspective lyrics; the release is notable for its influence on post-hardcore. Dag Nasty are a key melodic hardcore band that formed during the mid-1980s as part of the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene, with Brian Baker (ex-Minor Threat) on guitar. In 1988, the band All formed, featuring three members of the now disbanded Descendents. The band made music in a broadly similar vein to the Descendents, and were initially fronted by Dave Smalley of Dag Nasty.American Hardcore, p. 80. Gorilla Biscuits came out of the late 1980s New York hardcore scene, and played a melodic form of the hardcore subgenre known as youth crew. Youth crew itself takes a lot of influence from 7 Seconds, who ventured into melodic hardcore on albums such as The Crew. Turning Point, a New Jersey hardcore band, also emerged from the youth crew movement, but their later material moved towards melodic hardcore, with more complex music and introspective lyrics. In 1994, H2O formed, mixing melodic elements of Washington D.C. with New York & California hardcore punk. Lifetime was a notable emo group whose sound drew heavily on pop punk and melodic hardcore. Along with other melodic hardcore groups, they had much influence on subsequent pop punk, including bands such as Fall Out Boy and Saves the Day. When Lifetime broke up, some of their members formed Kid Dynamite. During the 1990s, the \\"Epi-Fat\\" sound (a variant of skate punk named after the labels that housed its key bands, Epitaph Records and Fat Wreck Chords) was popular, and key bands such as NOFX, Pennywise and Strung Out bordered on melodic hardcore influenced by the likes of Descendents and Bad Religion. Rise Against, formed in 1999, achieved widespread success by 2004. = Modern melodic hardcore (2000s‚Äìpresent) = Blood Youth are a modern melodic hardcore band formed in 2014. Rise Against, formed in 1999, achieved widespread commercial success with the release of their major label debut Siren Song of the Counter Culture in 2004, along with bands such as Strike Anywhere, Consumed, Ignite, Belvedere and A Wilhelm Scream, who continued the traditional style of melodic hardcore. Whereas, in the early to mid-2000s, the genre was transformed through the work of newly formed bands including Killing the Dream, Modern Life Is War, The Hope Conspiracy, Sinking Ships, Have Heart, Verse, The Carrier, Ruiner, This Is Hell, as well as the Canadian band Comeback Kid, many of which are housed by key hardcore labels Bridge 9 Records and Deathwish Inc. Thereafter by about 2009, \\"the likes of Defeater, Touch√© Amor√©, the Ghost Inside, Counterparts, Being as an Ocean, Stick to Your Guns, Vanna, and many more became the new faces of melodic, emotional hardcore\\", creating an overlap with post-hardcore and metalcore in current melodic hardcore. Many bands have crossed over into or out of the genre, Beartooth's sophomore album Aggressive marked a departure from their conventional hardcore punk sound into a style more reminiscent of melodic hardcore, Hundredth began as a band fusing metalcore and melodic hardcore, however eventually evolved into playing shoegaze on their fourth album Rare, traditional melodic hardcore band Strung Out began playing a heavily metal-influenced style on their eighth album Transmission.Alpha.Delta, California's AFI drifted from the genre to play a more commercially accessible sound on 2003's Sing The Sorrow; including a two-year stint, in which they played horror punk, on Black Sails, Black Sails in the Sunset, All Hallow's and The Art of Drowning and The White Noise began as an electronicore band on their first two records Set the Sun and Desolate, before beginning to play melodic metallic hardcore.

The name of the label came from their 1969 album On the Threshold of a Dream. The band formed this label to allow for artistically packaged gatefold covers for their LP releases, and for releasing band members' solo efforts. Threshold was distributed by Decca Records in the UK and by London Records in the United States. The first band to be signed up on this label were Westcountry rockers Asgard in 1972 who released two singles from their album, In the Realm of Asgard. Genesis, encouraged by Mike Pinder, also considered signing with the label in 1970. According to Tony Banks, they recorded a version of \\"Looking For Someone\\", a song which later appeared on their sophomore album Trespass but shelved it due to a mistake in performance toward the end with no time to redo it; he insists \\"I can't put out something that has a brown note on it and that's one of the reasons we didn't go with Threshold in the end.\\" Bassist John Lodge produced the band Trapeze for the Threshold label. The rock sextet Providence also recorded for Threshold. After 1976 the Moody Blues went back to having their albums manufactured by Decca Records (and later PolyGram and Universal Records), but the Threshold company and logo were maintained over the years as a means of selling their records through their own record shop in Cobham, Surrey. There was also a Threshold record shop in Swindon, UK in the late 1970s. The Moody Blues' subsequent albums, up to and including 1999's Strange Times, were branded 'in association with Threshold Records'.

Based heavily on Ptolemy's Almagest, and drawing additional ideas from Islamic astronomy, it was one of the most influential works of pre-Copernican astronomy in Europe. Reception Sacrobosco's De sphaera mundi was the most successful of several competing thirteenth-century textbooks on this topic. It was used in universities for hundreds of years and the manuscript copied many times before the invention of the printing press; hundreds of manuscript copies have survived. The first printed edition appeared in 1472 in Ferrara, and at least 84 editions were printed in the next two hundred years. The work was frequently supplemented with commentaries on the original text. The number of copies and commentaries reflects its importance as a university text.Olaf Pedersen, \\"In Quest of Sacrobosco\\", Journal for the History of Astronomy, 16 (1985): 175-221. Pedersen identifies 35 printings in Venice, another 35 in Paris, and more in 14 other cities throughout Europe. Content The 'sphere of the world' is not the earth but the heavens, and Sacrobosco quotes Theodosius saying it is a solid body. It is divided into nine parts: the \\"first moved\\" (primum mobile), the sphere of the fixed stars (the firmament), and the seven planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury and the moon. There is a 'right' sphere and an oblique sphere: the right sphere is only observed by those at the equator (if there are such people), everyone else sees the oblique sphere. There are two movements: one of the heavens from east to west on its axis through the Arctic and Antarctic poles, the other of the inferior spheres at 23¬∞ in the opposite direction on their own axes. The world, or universe, is divided into two parts: the elementary and the ethereal. The elementary consists of four parts: the earth, about which is water, then air, then fire, reaching up to the moon. Above this is the ethereal which is immutable and called the 'fifth essence' by the philosophers. All are mobile except heavy earth which is the center of the world. =The universe as a machine= Sacrobosco spoke of the universe as the machina mundi, the machine of the world, suggesting that the reported eclipse of the Sun at the crucifixion of Jesus was a disturbance of the order of that machine. This concept is similar to the clockwork universe analogy that became very popular centuries later, during the Enlightenment. =Spherical Earth= Picture from a 1550 edition of De sphaera Though principally about the universe, De sphaera 1230 A.D. contains a clear description of the Earth as a sphere which agrees with widespread opinion in Europe during the higher Middle Ages, in contrast to statements of some 19th- and 20th-century historians that medieval scholars thought the Earth was flat. As evidence for the Earth being a sphere, in Chapter One he cites the observation that stars rise and set sooner for those in the east (\\"Orientals\\"), and lunar eclipses happen earlier; that stars near the North Pole are visible to those further north and those in the south can see different ones; that at sea one can see further by climbing up the mast; and that water seeks its natural shape which is round, as a drop.

It was the last release to feature original bassist Will Heggie.  Background  Peppermint Pig marked the only time that the Cocteau Twins used an outside producer for one of their recordings, with production handled by Alan Rankine of the Associates. The band was dissatisfied with the results. Robin Guthrie described the EP as \\"shit\\" in a 1983 interview with Sounds, claiming it was \\"a bad mixture‚Äîbad song, bad producer, bad band\\". Elizabeth Fraser simply described the material as \\"all we had at the time\\".

The North Island piopio is now considered to be extinct. Taxonomy and systematics For many years, the North Island piopio was considered to be conspecific with the South Island piopio, but the two are now regarded as two separate species due to their pronounced differences in external appearance and osteology (Olson et al., 1983). An alternate name for the North Island piopio is the North Island thrush. Status The North Island piopio was endemic to the North Island of New Zealand and was described by Walter Buller as being common in 1873, although only a few specimens were ever collected, and it declined rapidly after that time (Buller, 1888). The last specimens were collected in 1900, or more probably in 1885/1886 (Medway, 1968), and by the 1960s only around 27 specimens remained in museums worldwide.see page 189 Medway, David G. (1968): Records of the Huia, North Island Thrush and North Island Kokako from the diaries of Joseph Robert Annabell (1857‚Äì1924) Notornis 15(3): 177‚Äì192. Occasional sight records of people claiming to have seen the bird (e.g. Sopp, 1957) persisted until 1970 (Bell & Singleton, 1974; Olsen 1993), but the North Island piopio is now considered extinct. Its last stronghold appears to have been the area that later became the Whanganui National Park, possibly extending north-east to the Hauhungaroa Range west of Lake Taupo. The introduction of foreign predatory mammals such as cats and rats to New Zealand's North Island is mostly to blame for the North Island piopio's extinction, with habitat loss and predation by mustelids also being significant from the 1880s onward.

It is partly government owned and offers telephone, internet and wireless services. BTC is an acronym for the Bahamas Telecommunications Company and offers telephone, internet and wireless services. In New Providence and Grand Bahama, it operates a GSM based EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE network. Dual-class shares are 49% economic shares/49% voting shares of BTC are owned by the Government of the Bahamas, with 49% economic shares/51% voting shares owned by Cable & Wireless Communications and 2% economic shares in a national trust. History =1892- Late 1990s = In 1892, a telegraph cable was laid between Jupiter, Florida and the western district of New Providence, coming ashore in Goodman‚Äôs Bay, Bahamas. The area then became known as ‚ÄúCable Beach.‚Äù On October 5, 1906, the first telephone system was introduced with 150 subscribers in Nassau. Bimini got wireless telegraphy in 1920 and Grand Bahama opened its first Telegraph Station in West End in 1925. On December 16, 1933, the first telephone service to the United States from the Bahamas was introduced. After World War II, the Telecommunications Department, of The Bahamas began to make steady progress in its development. Frequency shifters, the first in the Caribbean, were installed in 1946. An automatic time of day announcer was installed in Nassau in 1951, the very first outside of the continental US. Nine years later, in 1960, a Forward Tropospheric Scatter was installed between Delaporte and Florida City, the second of its kind in this hemisphere, the first being in Cuba. In 1966, the Government of The Bahamas, by an Act of Parliament, incorporated the Telecommunications Department as the Bahamas Telecommunications Corporation, a quasi-governmental corporation, known as Batelco. In 1967, the formerly expatriate-run Batelco got its first all- Bahamian Executive team, under the direction of R.E. Knowles, the first Bahamian General Manager. In 1971, direct distance dialing was introduced for Batelco operators and in 1972, under new General Manager Aubrey E. Curling, a $7 million submarine cable was installed from West Palm Beach to Eight Mile Rock through a joint venture agreement between AT & T and Batelco. Robert Bartlett took the reins of the Corporation on October 15, 1979, when he became General Manager. Under Mr. Bartlett‚Äôs administration, Batelco moved from its rented location in the Chase Building on Thompson Boulevard to its own offices on John F. Kennedy Drive, where the company‚Äôs headquarters is currently located. In 1986 the Corporation joined the Caribbean Association of National Telecommunications Organizations (CANTO) and hosted its annual meeting and trade show, as well as acquiring the assets of The Grand Bahama Telephone Company. It was also in the late eighties that Cellular Telephone Service was inaugurated in The Bahamas. In 1990, Robert Bartlett retired and Barrett Russell succeeded him as General Manager. In February 1992, fibre optics became a part of the Batelco system, enabling system upgrades throughout the archipelago, including Inagua where service was introduced in March of that year. Sir Albert Miller took over as Executive Chairman of Batelco in 1995. The following year, on April 10, 1996, an agreement was signed for the engineering and installation of the Bahamas II Submarine Cable and, on August 26, Batelco entered the internet market with the introduction of Batelnet. The 1990s ended with the introduction of CLASS to residential customers, bringing them caller id, automatic recall and a number of other features. The end of the millennium also saw significant upgrades to its fiber optic system, including a 26 million dollar cable between Vero Beach, Florida and Eight Mile Rock owned by a consortium with Batelco and AT&T; as the Terminal parties. = From BATELCO to BTC = The new millennium also marked a change from the name Batelco. On September 4, 2002, the company transitioned to the acronym BTC. In the mid-2000s, the GSM (Global System for Mobile) telephone system was introduced and replaced TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access ). During this time, the submarine BDSNI cable was introduced, connecting 14 islands of The Bahamas. In 2006, the BHi or Bahamas Haiti International marked the first time BTC partnered with another nation. Using the BDSNI cable, BTC links Port-au- Prince, Haiti with Matthew Town, Inagua providing the neighbouring nation with Vibe, I-Connect, GSM, WiFi and other products and services . In 2007 BTC partnered with Cisco Networks to build a new Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) backbone. This new network allowed BTC to provide new internet-protocol (IP) services to their customers. In late 2007, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health, BTC tested a pilot program that allowed medical experts in New Providence to read the vital signs of a patient located at a Ministry of Health clinic in Coopers Town, Abaco. During 2007 the Six Sigma program was created to reduce the response time to both fault resolution and the installation of services. The Universal Customer Service Representative (CSR), was designed to allow a CSR to work across different technologies, products and services, serving as a ‚Äúone-stop shop‚Äù for BTC customers. In 2008, a new online directory, bahamasypages. com was also introduced. =Privatization= On April 6, 2011, the Government of The Bahamas and Cable & Wireless Communications signed a document, privatizing The Bahamas Telecommunications Company - BTC and transferred 51% of the public corporation to the London- based company for a purchase price of $210 million. New payment methods including online minute-loading were introduced. A single number call centre was launched. The elimination of long distance charges between islands for calls originating from cell phones was introduced and a half million dollar expansion transformed what had been an administrative complex into the largest CWC store in the Caribbean. BTC also began a multimillion-dollar network overhaul to shift its data traffic from 2.5G speed to 4G, enabling the introduction of a host of high-speed phones and devices on the market. In 2014, after a change in government, a 2% share of the company - and controlling interest in BTC - was transferred from CWC back to Government.

The engine burns the Russian equivalent of RP-1 fuel and LOX oxidizer in four combustion chambers, all supplied by one single-shaft, single-turbine turbopump rated at in a staged combustion cycle. By comparison, the Rocketdyne F-1 engine (five of which were used on each Saturn V) is the world's most powerful single- combustion chamber rocket engine.  Shared turbopump  Several Soviet and Russian rocket engines use the approach of clustering small combustion chambers around a single turbine and pump. During the early 1950s, many Soviet engine designers, including Valentin P. Glushko, faced problems of combustion instability while designing bigger thrust chambers. At that time, they solved the problem by using a cluster of smaller thrust chambers.  Variants  =RD-170= The RD-170 engine featured four combustion chambers and was developed for use on the Energia launch vehicle ‚Äì both the engine and the launch vehicle were in production only for a short time. =RD-171= RD-171 model Building on the technology from the Energia launch vehicle the Zenit (rocket family) was developed, which uses a RD-170 variant, the RD-171. While the RD-170 had nozzles which swiveled on one axis only, the RD-171 swivels on two axes. RD-171 was intended to be used on Zenit rocket. Models called the RD-172 and RD-173 were proposed, upgrades that would provide additional thrust, and the RD-173 proposal was finalized as the RD-171M upgrade in 2006. =RD-171MV= A modification of RD-171M being developed for the Irtysh rocket. Unlike RD-171M it's completely made from Russian components and features a new control system. First test sample was manufactured in early 2019 =Dual-chamber derivative= The RD-180 uses only two combustion chambers instead of the four of the RD-170. The RD-180 used on the Atlas V replaced the three engines used on early Atlas rockets with a single engine and achieved significant payload and performance gains. This engine had also been chosen to be the main propulsion system for the first stage of the now cancelled Russian Rus-M rocket. =Single-chamber derivative= The RD-191 is a single-chamber version used in the Russian Angara rocket. Variants of RD-191 include RD-151 in South Korean Naro-1 rocket, RD-181 in American Orbital ATK Antares rocket, and the proposed RD-193 for the Soyuz-2-1v project. =Proposed variants= On 28 July 2011, NPO Energomash summarised the results of the work on Rus-M rocket engine and considered the possibility of construction several new variants of RD-170 family engines.

It has over 30 miles (50 km) of interconnecting trails that traverse gorges, ravines, pastures, and woodlands. Although about 3.2 million acres (1300 km¬≤) of the State of New York is in the State Forest Preserve, Wildlife Management Areas, and Forests, there are few large areas of public land in the Finger Lakes Region. The Finger Lakes National Forest is the only National Forest in New York, and the only public land that has had an explicit philosophy of multiple use. Early history The area around the Finger Lakes National Forest was originally inhabited by the Iroquois Indians. Information of their use of the area within the current forest boundary is sketchy at best. It is thought that at least some hunting activity occurred. This area was a forested hunting territory for the Iroquois people 250 years ago. Just 100 years ago, it was nearly treeless, the result of logging, farming, and grazing practices by Euro-American settlers. Today it is a mix of second growth woodland, pasture and lots which are in a transition from pasture-to-woodland. The cellar holes, stone walls, artifacts, and other material evidence of the former residents of this area are an unwritten reminder and historical record of their lives. They are protected by Federal Law. There are a number of archaeological sites on lands managed by the Finger Lakes National Forest, most from the post- Revolutionary period. Prior to the European rediscovery of eastern North America, Native Americans lived in this part of New York for more than 10,000 years. The Iroquois are the last in a series of Indian cultures to have lived here, and two of the six Iroquois Nations' homelands border the Forest. The lakes around which much Indian life took place now bear their names: Cayuga and Seneca. The lack of reliable water sources and lime-rich soils (good for corn agriculture) precluded development of large year-round Iroquois villages within the Forest's present-day boundaries, but the original forest cover of pines and hardwoods (such as hickory, elm, beech, chestnut, oak, and maple) would have made this a good hunting and nut-gathering territory for these people. American Revolution Because of the Iroquois alliance with the British during the American Revolution, George Washington assigned Generals Sullivan and Clinton to mount a campaign against them. The Sullivan Campaign of 1779 was major military undertaking which destroyed more than 40 villages and laid to waste hundreds of acres of cultivated fields and a large portion of the stored food and materials the Iroquois and British were dependent upon. A secondary, non-military result of the neutralization of the Six Nations Iroquois in this region was that it created \\"new\\" lands to allot to Colonial soldiers after the war in partial payment or reward for their service. The land was divided up into \\"military lots\\", the one mile (1.6 km) square (2.6 km¬≤) units that are still the basis for the road (and much of the trail) system present on the Finger Lakes National Forest today. In 1790, the area was divided into 600 acre (2.4 km¬≤) military lots and distributed among Revolutionary War veterans as payment for their services. These early settlers cleared the land for production of hay and small grains such as buckwheat. As New York City grew, a strong market for these products developed, encouraging more intensive agriculture. The farmers prospered until the mid-19th century, when a series of unfortunate events occurred - the popularity of motorized transportation in urban centers (reducing the number of horses to be fed), gradual depletion of the soil resource, and competition from the midwest. Federal purchase of the land Map of the Finger Lakes National Forest Between 1890 and the Great Depression, over 1 million acres (4000 km¬≤) of farmland was abandoned in south central New York State. In the 1930s it was recognized that farmers in many parts of the country could no longer make a living from their exhausted land. Environmental damage was occurring as they cultivated the land more and more intensively to make ends meet. Several pieces of legislation were passed, including the Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933, and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 to address these problems. One result was the formation of a government agency, the Resettlement Administration, to carry out the new laws. This agency directed the relocation of farmers to better land or different jobs, and the purchase of marginal farmland by the Federal government. Between 1938 and 1941, over 100 farms were purchased in the area now in the National Forest. Because this was done on a willing-seller, willing-buyer basis, the resulting Federal ownership resembled a patchwork quilt. This was especially true in the Seneca County end of the Forest, where soils were more productive, and some families elected to stay. This ownership pattern still exists today. The newly acquired Federal land, named the Hector Land Use Area (LUA), was initially managed by the Soil Conservation Service. The emphasis was on stabilization of the soil by planting conifers, and development of a grazing program. Previously cultivated fields were converted to improved pastures to demonstrate how less intensive agriculture could still make productive use of the land. In 1943, the Hector Cooperative Grazing Association was formed. This organization was issued a long term lease to manage grazing on the (LUA). They coordinated use of the pastures by as many as 120 individual livestock owners within a 100-mile (160 km) radius of the (LUA). In 1996, the property associated with the former Camp Fossenvue was added to the forest. On that property is the Queen's Castle, a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Creation of the national forest Entrance sign for Blueberry Patch Campground in the Finger Lakes National Forest By the 1950s, many of the original objectives of the Hector (LUA) had been met. Farmers had been resettled, the eroding soil stabilized, and alternative agriculture uses demonstrated. At the same time, the public was becoming interested in the concept of multiple uses of public land. Management and appropriate ownership of the Hector LUA was reevaluated. The decision was made in 1954 to transfer administrative responsibilities to the U.S. Forest Service, which already had a fairly long history of multiple use management. Initially this was carried out by the Regional Office in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. When this region was later consolidated within the Forest Service's Northeast Region, Hector became an administrative unit of the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont. In 1982, the Federal land management agencies were directed to identify isolated parcels of federal land that could be sold without significantly affecting the resource base or public service. The intent was to dispose of lands that were inefficient to manage, and to generate revenue. The Hector Land Use Area was one parcel studied for possible disposal under this \\"Assets Management\\" program. When public meetings were held to evaluate this idea, there was strong local support for continued federal ownership. Local and regional citizens had come to depend on Hector for wood products, forage, recreation, and other benefits. Because of this public support, Congress enacted legislation to make it a permanent part of the National Forest System. The Hector Ranger District, Green Mountain National Forest, had been created. Local citizens asked the Forest Service to change the name to Hector Ranger District, Finger Lakes National Forest, so it would be less confusing to visitors, and promote local pride about the area. This change was made in October 1985. Today The national forest is a public use resource in both Seneca County and Schuyler County, lying between Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake. The Finger Lakes National Forest is an administrative unit of the Green Mountain National Forest. Both are managed by the Forest Service from offices in Rutland, Vermont. The Forest has continued the management mix of pasture, forest, recreation and wildlife and includes the preservation of historic and archaeological sites. It is the second-smallest National Forest in the United States, larger than only the Tuskegee National Forest in Alabama.

It enrolls approximately 500 students. The academy is co-educational and is run independently within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington. History Archmere Academy was founded in 1932 by the Norbertine religious order, initially as an all-boys school. It began on the former estate of U.S. industrialist John J. Raskob, who lived there with his wife Helena and their 12 children until 1931. Raskob was the campaign manager for New York Governor Al Smith during his presidential campaign in 1928 and the home was used for many meetings, including those of the Democratic National Committee. John J. Raskob, owner of the former estate on which Archmere Academy now sits The estate was purchased by Bernard Pennings in 1932. He was the Abbot of the Norbertine Order and is attributed as the founder of St. Norbert College, a private Catholic liberal arts college located in De Pere, Wisconsin. The estate was purchased for $300,000 in the spring of 1932 and officially dedicated in the fall of 1932. The first year of operation, Archmere Academy had an enrollment of 22 students, 16 freshmen and 6 sophomores. In 1933 and 1934, enrollment grew to 50 students and 72 students respectively. Archmere Academy began slowly expanding during the mid to late 1930s due to enrollment increases. Minor expansions were made to accommodate boarding students. In 1939 it built its first gymnasium and by 1940 it had converted the manor on the property into a science center. The school made a transition in the mid-1940s by where it became strictly a four-year college preparatory institution. It phased out both 7th and 8th grades during the 1946-47 and 1947-48 school years. It continued as a day school and boarding school for boys while its enrollment continued to increase. In 1957, Archmere Academy celebrated its 25th anniversary with the groundbreaking for St. Norbert Hall, the school's main academic building, which was completed in 1959. Going into the 1960s, it continued to expand to accommodate the increase in enrollment, which had reached 394 students by the end of that decade. The Justin E. Diny Science Center was opened in 1973 with classrooms for physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental science. The old science center was turned into a center for the arts which held classes for the school's chorus, band, theater, and studio arts program. St. Norbert Hall, the center of academic life at Archmere The 1970s brought about two major changes for Archmere Academy. It moved away from being a boarding school and became a day school exclusively. In 1975 it also announced the decision to become a co-ed institution, enrolling 50 women into the school. It was near the end of the 1970s that the academy established a Board of Trustees, the first meeting of which took place in 1980. The Board has been credited with expanding the curriculum and extracurricular activities at the academy as well as further expanding to accommodate the new programs. One expansion included a renovation of St. Norbert Hall which included an addition to the current building. Additional expansion in the early 1980s included a new auditorium that seated 750 people, as well as a new library constructed on campus. In April 2001, an internal dispute among the Norbertines relating to the establishment of Claymont Priory separate from Daylesford Abbey spilled over into the administration of Archmere Academy. Interventions from alumni calmed the turmoil and resulted in the Academy taking control of the former Raskob residence, known as \\"the Patio.\\"Margot Patterson (May 11, 2001). \\"Turmoil follows school firings - Archmere Academy\\". National Catholic Reporter 2003 marked the beginning of the academy's \\"Building on Mission & Heritage\\" campaign that included goals to complete the Justin E. Diny Science Center expansion, the construction of a Student Life Center, and renovations to the athletic field. The school broke tradition with the implementation of a non- Norbertine headmaster when Dr. Michael Marinelli, a 1976 graduate of Archmere Academy, took over at the beginning of 2010. Towards the end of the 2015-16 academic school year, Archmere began massive renovations on Saint Norbert's Hall. This reconstruction made changes to the library and every room in the building. =Architecture= Archmere Academy was built between 1916 and 1918 and was once the country estate of John J. Raskob and his wife. Raskob was a financier, the developer of the Empire State Building, and a previous chairman for the Democratic National Committee. The name \\"Archmere\\" was given to the estate because of the natural arch of the trees formed over the Delaware River vista. The original building that Raskob constructed, also known as the Patio, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. In 2009, the Delaware Public Archives dedicated Archmere Academy with a historical marker. Academics Archmere students are required to take courses in a variety of areas, including eight semesters of English, seven semesters of religion, and six semesters of mathematics, foreign language, history, and the sciences. Choices for elective classes include art, yearbook (which meets during class time), band, chorus, and computer courses. Archmere offers a large number of AP courses, including Spanish, French, Statistics, Calculus (both AB and BC), Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Environmental Science, Art Portfolio in 2-D and 3-D, Computer Science, English, Composition, US History, European History, and World History. It has been ranked high for overall student SAT scores, ranking 2nd in the state of Delaware for the 2011-12 school year. =Music program= The music program at Archmere Academy is an elective program that focuses on performance practices from the Renaissance to the 20th century including jazz and Broadway. Instruction is provided mostly through rehearsal experience although there is a course on music theory for advanced students as well as a songwriting course. Performing groups include the Jazz Ensemble, Concert Choir, Stage Band, and Mastersingers. The Mastersingers was founded in 1988 and consists of 30 students selected by audition at the beginning of the school year. In addition to performing at school liturgies and community concerts, they compete nationally and internationally. The academy also has a partnership that allows student musicians to study with the Serafin String Quartet. Athletics Archmere competes in the Diamond State Conference for interscholastic sports such as football, field hockey, basketball, ice hockey, soccer, swimming, diving, lacrosse, volleyball, golf, tennis, cheerleading, baseball, softball, cross country, track and field, and wrestling. Archmere's campus features two artificial turf fields (utilized by football, M/W soccer, M/W lacrosse, and field hockey), a baseball field (upgraded with dugouts), a softball field (upgraded with dugouts), six tennis courts, and a running track. In recent years, Archmere has brought home multiple DIAA championships, such as volleyball and rugby. The 2014 girls volleyball team brought home the trophy following a victory over Charter. In the following year, Archmere volleyball once again went to the finals, however this time losing to Delaware Military Academy. The rugby team at Archmere has brought home 3 consecutive Delaware state titles in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The rugby team would win again in 2019, capturing the Mark Dombroski Cup and the Subaru 7's Regional Championship. The Boys Soccer team would win the school's first state title in soccer and the first DIAA State Title for Archmere since 2014. They would go on to defeat Wilmington Friends 1-0, ending their season 17-1.

His invention of the 3-ring release safety device has enhanced skydiving safety. He founded the companies United Parachute Technologies and Complete Parachute Solutions, which had 150 employees as of 2015. Work Bill Booth began skydiving in 1965, and in 1972 started a skydiving equipment company based in a Miami garage. In the late 1970s, Booth made two skydiving inventions. First he invented and patented the Hand Deploy Pilot Chute System. Later, he invented the 3-ring release system. The company's first harness/container system was the Wonderhog in 1974. This was followed by the Wonderhog Sprint and in 1980 by the Vector. The U.S. Skydiving Team wore the first Vectors at the 1981 World Meet. The Vector II followed six years later. In 1983, Booth received the Parachute Equipment Industry Association Achievement Award. The Federation Aeronautic International awarded him the 1984 Gold Medal for outstanding achievement in parachute safety design. Inventions Booth's invention of the 3-ring release safety device enhanced skydiving safety. The device allows the rapid release of the skydiver's main parachute in the event of a malfunction. Currently, all sport skydiving equipment and some military systems employ the design.The 3 Ring: What It Is, And How It Works He also invented the pull-out and throw-out pilot chute.http://patents.justia.com/patent/4039164 A pilot chute is a small parachute used to extract and deploy a main parachute. The throw-out approach replaces the spring-loaded pilot chute which was released by a rip-cord. The throw-out system allows the skydiver to deploy his or her pilot chute directly into the air stream. Other inventions include the Skyhook RSLhttp://patents.justia.com/patent/7118073http://patents.justia.com/patent/20040155153 safety device and the \\"Sigma System\\" for tandem drogue release. Booth founded The Relative Workshop, a sport skydiving equipment manufacturer that introduced the WonderHog harness/container system. The WonderHog was so named because of the 'piggy-back' design with the reserve container located above the main container on the back of the skydiver instead of the belly-mounted reserve seen on earlier systems. The Relative Workshop has changed its name and is now called United Parachute Technologies. Booth was also instrumental in obtaining FAA recognition of the tandem jump as a means of teaching skydiving. From 1984 to 2001, tandem skydiving was possible in the US only as an \\"volunteer experimental test jumper\\" under exemptions to FAA rules, due to the \\"one person, two parachutes\\" definition of parachuting. United Parachute Technologies sells the Vector 3 and Vector 3 Micron Harness/Container system. The latest versions incorporate innovations like magnetic riser covers, a spectra ripcord and the Skyhook RSL system. 'Booth's rule #2', which states that \\"The safer skydiving gear becomes, the more chances skydivers will take, in order to keep the fatality rate constant\\" is often attributed to him. See Risk compensation.

The main focus of Apress is to produce books for software developers, IT professionals and programmers. Its original name was Author's Press shortened to APress, then Apress. In 2003, Apress purchased much of the intellectual property of the designer-oriented publisher friends of ED. Topics covered relate largely to programming issues, on both proprietary and open source platforms. Hardware hacking is also a theme, and Apress has published some books aimed for mainstream consumer electronics users. In addition, Apress crosses over the IT line and publishes business books. Apress uses computer industry leaders to produce in partnership the best technical books in their chosen specialist computer fields. Apress also reviews all books before publishing to ensure they are technically correct like a software company does prior to releasing new software. Many of their published books have source codes attached to them so that readers can learn the skills associated with said work. Apress authors include Andrew Troelsen, Adam Freeman, Ed Yourdon, Matt MacDonald, Andy Budd, Rob Harrop, Dave Mark, Robert Ciesla, Michael A. Banks, Keir Thomas, Malcolm Harkins, Jacob Lamm, Scott Donaldson, Peter Seibel, Bob Walsh, Rory Lewis, and Joel Spolsky. Their print books are distributed worldwide by Springer Science + Business Media, and they are also sold as eBooks and distributed online through the subscription services such as SpringerLink, Books 24X7 and Safari Online. In 2007 Apress was fully acquired by Springer. Prior to this Springer owned a minority stake, and in 2009 Apress' offices in Berkeley, California closed and the business moved to Springer's headquarters in New York. In 2012 Apress announced their new ApressOpen line of books, providing ebooks free through all of their ebook, electronic subscription and sponsor's channels. Springer merged with Nature Publishing Group and other related companies to form Springer Nature in 2015.  Collaborations  As well as collaborating with computer authors. Apress has also collaborated with software companies. Alongside collaborations with large organisations Apress has also sought out collaborations with individuals who have produced work that they feel are worthy of publishing. One such collaboration was with the inventor of the iPhone application sketch, they brought the publishing rights to the book \\"Little more than a month after releasing the iPhone Application Sketch Book its creator, Dean Kaplan, has already sold the publishing rights to Apress Publishing House for an undisclosed amount.\\" this shows that Apress is looking for not only the kudos of working with big companies but also developing other ideas they think that their readers would be interested in.  ApressOpen  In order to release Apress publications to a wider audience they have created ApressOpen where they currently have 25 completely free books to download. In order to achieve this they are using Springerlink which allows \\"over 122,000,000 unique visitors per year as well as on Apress.com, Intel.com, and all major eBook and database platforms.\\" Notable books * Big Data Analytics with Spark * Pro C# 5.0 and the .NET 4.5 Framework * Beginning iOS6 Development * Pro ASP.NET MVC4 * Pro JQuery * iPhone and iPad Apps For Absolute Beginners * Pro Android * Mostly Codeless Game Development * Traders at Work * Inventors at Work * Power Plays * Managing Humans * Beginning ASP.NET 4.5 in C# * Beginning Node.js * Fixing and Flipping Real Estate * Practical Common Lisp * Managing Risk and Information Security * Game Development with Ren'Py * Startup: An Insiders Guide to Launching and Running a Business * SQL Server Query Performance Tuning Distilled * Numerical Methods using MATLAB Books in series * Beginning Python * Gimp * Learn Objective-C on the Mac * Beginning iOS Development * Coders at Work * Beginning Android Games * Android Tablets Made Simple References External links * Category:Book publishing companies based in New York (state) Category:Computer book publishing companies Category:Springer Science+Business Media imprints ","title":"Apress"},{"id":"2457202","text":"LTG Arthur E.

The criteria for inclusion in this list are: * 1‚Äì3 places winners at major international tournaments; * for team sports, winning in preliminary competitions of finals at major international tournaments, or playing for several seasons for clubs of major national leagues; or * holders of past and current world records. Boldface denotes a current competitor. To be included in the list, one does not necessarily have to practice Judaism. Some members of the list may practice other religions or no religion at all, but are of Jewish ancestry. The topic of Jewish participation in sports is discussed extensively in academic and popular literature. Scholars believe that sports have been a historical avenue for Jewish people to overcome obstacles toward their participation in secular society (especially before the mid-20th century in Europe and the United States).See, e.g.: Encyclopedia of Jewish people in Sports by Bernard Postal, Jesse Silver, Roy Silver (1965); Great Jews in Sports by Robert Slater (2003), ; Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe by Michael Brenner, Gideon Reuveni (2006), ; Jewish, Sports, and the Rites of Citizenship ed.

History The AP was registered as a political party in August 2005, when political parties were allowed to operate for the first time following widespread protests for democracy. Adhaalath has been active in the political arena and has been instrumental in all the recent government changes. Along with Jumhooree Party, Adhaalath has played a pivotal role in the elections, the balance of power shifting to the side to which Adhaalath Party supported during the second round of both the recent presidential elections. The party's first president was Sheikh Hussain Rasheed Ahmed. After the tenure of Sheikh Hussain Rasheed Ahmed, Sheikh Imran Abdullah became the second president of Adhaalath Party. Dr. Mauroof Hussain, a noted E.N.T specialist trained in India has been the vice president of the party since the beginning. Since May 2015, after the Adhaalath Party together with the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party organised a rally calling for ending government corruption and judicial reform, the current president of the party Sheikh Imran Abdullah has been incarcerated without trial by the government of president Yameen Abdul Qayyoom after Abdullah gave a speech in support of former president Mohamed Nasheed. On 16 February 2016, Sheikh Imran was sentenced to 12 years in prison, convicting him on a terrorism charge for the speech he gave at the opposition protest held on May 1st 2015 which the government said to have created fear and mistrust among the locals, which led to multiple injuries to police officers, locals and their properties.

The joint British-Australian Blue Streak program to develop Intercontinental ballistic missiles ended in the late 1960s. Around the same time the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) was established to develop a European satellite launch vehicle. Woomera, Australia, was chosen as the launch site for the test vehicles. Australia was granted status as the only non-European member of ELDO (one of the precursors to the European Space Agency) in return for providing the launch facilities. A series of successful launches was conducted from 1964 to 1970 with the aim of reaching orbit and eventually orbiting an operational satellite. The final launch attempt of ELDO's Europa 1 launch vehicle took place at Woomera on 12 June 1970 however the satellite failed to reach orbit. No successful satellite launch was ever achieved by the ELDO and European satellite launch activities then shifted to the French site at Kourou, in French Guiana, which is now home to Ariane launchers. Since then Australian space-related activities have been virtually nonexistent. The goal of the ASRI is to re-establish Australia as a significant player in the global space industry. Sounding Rockets The Small Sounding Rocket Program (SSRP), initiated in the mid-1990s, provides Australian educational institutions with a low cost payload launch service. The service has expanded to include to individuals, companies, foreign universities and non-commercial organisations seeking assistance to launch their own vehicles. Launches are conducted twice a year from Woomera, South Australia. Two types of rockets are used: *Sighter, a solid fuel rocket capable of launching a 3 kg payload to an altitude of 5.9 km at speeds over Mach 1, and *Zuni, a solid fuel rocket capable of launching a heavier payload to an altitude of approximately 7 km, and reaching speeds of Mach 2.5. Launch vehicle development The aim of the AUSROC program is to develop a micro-satellite launch vehicle capable of being scaled up for use in heavier launch vehicles. =AUSROC I= The AUSROC I program commenced in 1988 with a group of undergraduate students in Mechanical Engineering at Monash University, who designed and built AUSROC I. It was successfully launched on 9 February 1989. The flight lasted one minute, reaching 3 km in altitude and 161 m/s. AUSROC I was a liquid-fueled rocket based on a modified Pacific Rocket Society design.Australian Space Research Institute, AUSROC 1 =AUSROC II= AUSROC II was a larger pressure fed kerosene-oxygen bipropellant rocket that was developed in the 1990s. It was designed to reach an altitude of 10 km. The first attempt at launching an AUSROC II suffered a spectacular failure on the launch pad in 1992. The subsequent rocket, named AUSROC II-2 was successfully launched in 1995 from Woomera, although it did not reach its target apogee due to pressurisation problems with the LOX tank. =AUSROC 2.5= AUSROC 2.5 was designed to provide an intermediate step between the AUSROC II and III programs. It uses the same size engine as the AUSROC III but with simpler and easier to implement cooling methods. The primary objective was to deliver a 10 kg payload to an altitude of 20 km and recover the rocket intact. AUSROC 2.5 was the principal subject of current developments efforts. It was projected to launch in late 2007. Prior to that, a key milestone was the ground testing of the propulsion subsystem. The project is currently seeking volunteers to assist with manufacturing, integration and testing. =AUSROC III= AUSROC III was designed to launch a payload of 150 kg to an altitude of 500 km. It was a sounding rocket that will incorporate active guidance for \\"live\\" steering, and a steerable parachute recovery system. =AUSROC IV= AUSROC IV was the final stage of the AUSROC program and consisted of five AUSROC IIIs, four for the first stage and one for the second stage. It was intended to place a small satellite (up to 35 kg) into a Low Earth Orbit. =AUSROC Nano= AUSROC Nano is a three-stage, liquid-liquid-solid orbital launch vehicle, designed to launch a payload of 10 kg into low Earth orbit at an altitude of 300 km. It was designed to incorporate a rapid setup and launch capability that would provide the payload with the option of polar or equatorial orbit profiles. Zuni rockets The Australian Government has donated its Zuni rockets to the ASRI for use for student experiments which are launched from the Woomera launching range. Every year, a few Zunis are launched there. ASRI has also designed and constructed custom nosecones and payload recovery mechanisms for the Zuni.Australian Space Research Institute, Zuni Launch Vehicle With a payload of 20 kg, the Zuni has an approximate range of 5.9 km, which it attains in about 40 seconds, experiencing 55 g and 491 m/s (Mach 1.4) during the flight.  Satellites  The discontinued Australis Microsatellite program aimed to develop a low-cost, autonomous satellite that could be used for a variety of applications such as low Earth orbit communications, remote sensing and small scale science experiments. JAESAT (Joint Australian Engineering Satellite) is a collaboration between ASRI, the Cooperative Research Centre for Satellite Systems, the Queensland University of Technology and Ukrainian Youth Aerospace Association, Suzirya, that began in 1997. The project was put on hold in 2000 when CRCSS withdrew funds due to cost and schedule over-runs with a joint American-Australian venture, FedSat. Hypersonics The Centre for Hypersonics at the University of Queensland (UQ) performs extensive research into developing the science behind scramjet propulsion. The hypersonics project, currently on hold is a joint effort between ASRI and UQ to develop a free-flight scramjet engine.

(The pilot, \\"Serenity\\", was not shown until nine other episodes had been aired.) According to the DVD commentary, Whedon and Tim Minear had only two days to write the script. The crew of Serenity take on a hovertrain robbery commissioned by a sinister crime lord. The cargo they are after, however, is worth more than they know.  Synopsis  Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds, Zoe and Jayne Cobb are in a bar. When Lund celebrates the sixth anniversary of Unification Day with a toast, former Browncoat rebel Mal picks a fight. Zoe immediately steps up to help him out, but Jayne holds back at first (\\"Hey, I didn't fight in no war. Best of luck, though\\"), but eventually joins the melee. Greatly outnumbered, Mal radios his pilot, Wash, for help. Serenity arrives just in time and rescues the hapless crew (their foes do not realize the freighter is unarmed). In the ship's infirmary, Dr. Simon Tam is tending to his mentally disturbed teenage sister River. One of the other passengers, \\"Shepherd\\" (preacher) Book, tells Mal that Simon is very brave for giving up his life as a wealthy doctor to go on the run to protect his sister. On a \\"skyplex\\" (an orbiting space city), Mal, Zoe, and Jayne meet with crime lord Adelei Niska and his hulking lieutenant Crow. To show that he is not to be trifled with, Niska shows them a bloody corpse hanging by its feet: the last person who failed him. Niska has a job for Mal and his crew: steal two crates from a train as it travels from Hancock to Paradiso and deliver it to Crow. Mal shows no interest in knowing what is in the crates. When Mal and Zoe board the train, they discover that an entire squad of Alliance troops is also aboard, though not specifically guarding the cargo. After the pair break into the locked train car and secure the crates, Jayne is lowered on a winch while Serenity maintains station over the speeding train. While they attach the cargo to the winch, a curious Fed trips a smoke trap Zoe set up at the car door. In the resulting chaos, a wounded Jayne is hoisted back to the ship along with the crates, Mal knocks out the Fed before he can see what is happening, and Mal and Zoe take advantage of another smoke bomb to reenter the passenger car without anyone the wiser. Wash parks Serenity in a canyon, not at the rendezvous point. Jayne tells the crew that they should finish the job. Wash refuses to abandon his wife and Mal. Shepherd Book, who knows a lot about crime lords for a shepherd, says, \\"If Niska finds out [Mal] is being held, and may speak as to who hired him ‚Äî I think we're better off being a little late.\\" Meanwhile, in Paradiso, Mal and Zoe are aghast to find that they stole medicine desperately needed in the poor mining town, whose residents all suffer from \\"Bowden's malady\\", a degenerative disease. The local sheriff is suspicious of Mal's cover story. Inara appears and uses her considerable status as a Companion. She claims that Mal is her runaway \\"indentured man\\" who persuaded Zoe to leave her husband. The impressed sheriff lets her take the \\"runaways\\" back into her own custody. Back on the ship, Mal announces to the crew that they will deliver the medicine to the townspeople. However, Crow and his henchmen find them, and a violent fight ensues, which the Serenity crew wins. After the villains are secured, Mal and Zoe drive the cargo back to near the town, intending to drop off the crates and notify the sheriff once they are well away, but they run into the sheriff. Realizing what they have done, he lets them go. Outside Serenity, Mal offers Niska's money to a trussed-up Crow, but Crow threatens to hunt Mal down. Mal casually kicks Crow into Serenity's running engine intake, killing him. Mal finds the next henchman more cooperative. Back on an Alliance cruiser, two mysterious men in suits and wearing blue gloves inquire about a girl and show the captain a photo of River Tam.  Notes  Since this second episode was actually the first to be aired, writers Joss Whedon and Tim Minear had to introduce the characters to the new audience, even though many elements of these introductions were covered in the actual pilot, \\"Serenity\\". Quite a bit of the dialogue alludes to information provided in the pilot. The ominous \\"Hands of Blue\\", two men who are pursuing River, first appear in this episode. As noted by Tim Minear in the DVD commentary, Book's knowledge of underworld dealings (particularly his theory of Niska's reaction to an incarcerated Mal and Zoe) alludes to his cryptic past.

She was born St√©phanie Caroline Anne Syms and known as \\"Pamela\\". Her origins are uncertain. She was described as an adopted daughter of F√©licit√© de Genlis; it is usually assumed that she was an unacknowledged daughter of Madame de Genlis and Louis Philip II, Duke of Orl√©ans. However, there is a tradition in Fogo, Newfoundland, that she was the illegitimate daughter of an English naval officer, was taken to England and ended up in the Genlis household. During the French Revolution, the Genlis family fled to England. By then an attractive young woman, Pamela became engaged to Richard Sheridan, but the engagement was quickly ended. She instead married Lord Edward FitzGerald at Tournai on 27 December 1792. They settled at his home in Kildare and had three children: Edward Fox (1794‚Äì1863); Pamela, afterwards wife of General Sir Guy Campbell; Lucy Louisa, who married Captain Lyon, RN. As the country seethed with rebellion, FitzGerald was hunted by the government and forced into hiding. He was betrayed a few days before the date set for the planned rising he was to lead and was wounded resisting arrest on 19 May 1798. Although his wound was to the shoulder and relatively minor it was left untreated and he died of his wounds on 5 June. As a traitor to the British crown, his estates were confiscated, and Pamela was compelled to leave the country to avoid possible charges of treason. Pamela fled to Hamburg, where in 1800 she married Joseph Pitcairn, the American consul to Hamburg. Although she had been greatly beloved and esteemed by the whole FitzGerald family, her intimacy with them ceased after her second marriage. She remained to the last passionately devoted to the memory of her first husband and died in November 1831 in Paris, where a portrait of her hangs in the Louvre. During the Franco-Prussian War, her gravestone was damaged, so in 1880 her remains were brought back to England and were buried in the churchyard of St. Nicholas, Thames Ditton, Surrey, with her elder daughter, Pamela (Lady Guy Campbell).The Old Limerick Journal. French edition. See \\"J.P. Leonard\\". Retrieved 24 May 2014. The damaged gravestone can still be seen in the graveyard of St Nicholas.

Taxonomy When he first described the species in 1829, naturalist William John Swainson assigned it to the genus Setophaga ‚Äî the same genus as that of the American redstart ‚Äî where it remained for nearly a century and a half, though one naturalist placed it in the Old World flycatcher genus Muscicapa during that time. By the mid 1960s, researchers recommended that it be moved to its current genus, Myioborus, based on various similarities with the other whitestarts. The painted whitestart is the sister taxon to all the other species in the genus Myioborus. There are two subspecies, which differ only slightly in appearance: *M. p. pictus is found from Arizona and New Mexico in the southern United States to Oaxaca and Veracruz in Mexico. Birds in the northern part of the range tend to migrate to the southern parts of the subspecies' range for the winter. *M. p. guatemalae, which is found from Chiapas in southern Mexico to northern Nicaragua, has little or no white edging on the tertials and less white on the fourth rectrix of the tail. It is non-migratory. Description The painted whitestart is the largest of the whitestarts. Measurements: * Length: 5.1-5.9 in (13-15 cm) * Weight: 0.3-0.4 oz (8-11 g) * Wingspan: 8.3 in (21 cm) The sexes are the same in plumage, though males average slightly larger than females. The adult is mostly black, with a bright red lower breast and belly, large white wing patches, white outer tail feathers and white crescents below its eyes. The bill and legs are blackish. The juvenile painted whitestart lacks the red belly and glossy black plumage of the adult. It is brownish-gray overall, with a paler belly and undertail coverts, and a pale cream or buff tinge to its wing patches. =Voice= Painted whitestarts are unusual amongst birds, and especially amongst warblers in that the female painted redstart is capable of singing just as well as a male, and during spring courtship a pair will often bond by singing together. Distribution and habitat Painted whitestarts are common in open oak woodlands and canyons at heights between in Central America and Mexico, ranging as far north as the Madrean sky islands and Mogollon Rim in Arizona and New Mexico and Big Bend National Park in Texas. During the summer and winter, these birds may venture as far south as Nicaragua. In 2010, a painted redstart was found further north in California than had ever been recorded, in Auburn, CA, east of Sacramento. In 2013, one was observed in Berkeley, CA.http://www.berkeleyside.com/2013/11/18/painted-redstart-visits- berkeley-a-first-for-alameda-county/ Breeding Their nesting is done on the ground, and they create their nests so that they will be hidden among rocks, roots, or tufts of grass on steeply sloping ground. Their nests are large and shallow, constructed of strips of bark, plant fibers, leaves, and grass. The female will lay 3 or 4 white to cream-colored eggs that are speckled with fine brown and reddish spots. Incubation lasts about 14 days, but other nesting details are largely unknown. The young painted whitestart has a deep yellow- orange mouth lining.

A. Stargardt, Marburg, Germany, 1984), Tafel 75 Conan assumed the title of Duke of Brittany in the spring of 990 following his attack on Nantes and the subsequent death of Count Alan. As Duke, his rule succeeded the Regency that governed Brittany during the life of Drogo and the fractured rule of Brittany after Drogo's death by his illegitimate brothers Ho√´l and Guerech, and the latter's son Alan. The fractured rule over Brittany resulted in a short vacancy in the title Duke of Brittany.

The band's hits include \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"Kyrie\\". Since the early 1980s, he has also been a background singer for many artists and bands, and a solo artist since 1996.Interview on Inside MusiCast, January 5, 2009 He wrote songs for popular artists such as Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Dionne Warwick, and Josh Groban, among others. Early life Page was born on May 16, 1953 in Keokuk, Iowa. His parents, Robert and Joyce Page, were both professional musicians. Robert was a singer and choral director while his wife was an accomplished organist, pianist, and singer. In the mid-1950s, the family of seven (Page has a sister and three brothers, who are all musicians) moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where his parents worked as music directors at a local Methodist church. His mother knew Richard had a special interest in the family \\"business\\" when he came home from Sunday school to announce that he was the only baritone in the four-year-old class. The Pages lived in Montgomery from 1955 to 1962. In the late 1960s, the family moved to Phoenix, Arizona where his mother worked as the Assistant Director of the Phoenix Boys Choir for many years while his father was a musical director at a Phoenix church. Page attended Central High School, performing in school musicals such as Oliver! \\"It was a great experience, I was a horrible student, I had to beg the vice- principal to graduate me,‚Äù Page said in 2015. ‚ÄúHe did because he knew my interests were in music, I had sort of excelled in that area.‚Äù Page cited that his musical influences at this stage included The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Career On the day he graduated in 1971, Page moved to Hollywood. In Los Angeles, Page and Steve George, a friend from Phoenix, ‚Äúknocked around the LA music scene, eventually working with topflight acts like REO Speedwagon, Andy Gibb, Al Jarreau, and Kenny Loggins.‚Äù Page turned down the offer to be the lead singer for the bands Chicago and Toto. The position that he turned down with Chicago was accepted by Jason Scheff. His first major band, Pages, was formed with his childhood friend, Steve George, after he moved to Los Angeles from San Diego in the late 1970s. After producing three \\"Pages\\" albums, Page and George formed Mr. Mister along with Steve Farris and Pat Mastelotto. Page was on vocals/bass, George handled keyboards, Farris played guitar, and Mastelotto was on drums. The band's first album was I Wear The Face (1984). Page has said that in this album the band was \\"just getting together and figuring out\\" how they wanted to sound. Page (middle) performing with Ringo Starr and Todd Rundgren in 2013 As frontman for Mr. Mister, Page scored two consecutive Hot 100 No. 1's with the singles \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"Kyrie\\", both of which Page composed in collaboration with his cousin, John Lang. Both songs were released in 1985 and appeared on Mr. Mister's breakthrough second album, Welcome to the Real World, which also came out in 1985 and reached No. 1 on the albums charts. The group was nominated for several Grammy Awards, including Best Pop Band in 1986. Mr. Mister's third album, Go On‚Ä¶ was released in 1987. In an interview, Page said that they \\"tried many new and different sounds and ideas\\" and that it included some of the band's best songwriting. Before breaking up on September 25, 1990, the group recorded a fourth Mr. Mister album, Pull, in 1989. It was not released until 2010. Page has described \\"Pull\\" (2010) as the group's \\"most experimental album.\\" Many of Page's songs for Mr. Mister, and many of his solo numbers, were co-written with Steve George and John Lang..\\" Subsequently, he was a member of Third Matinee with Patrick Leonard, before he released his first solo album Shelter Me in 1996. It featured the singles \\"The Best Thing\\" and \\"My Oxygen\\", a remake of Nik Kershaw's hit. In 1997, he turned down an offer from Leonard to record a second Third Matinee album. Following Shelter me, Page worked as a songwriter and session player. His songwriting clients include Kenny Loggins, Madonna (Golden Globes and Grammy nominated song, \\"I'll Remember\\" from With Honors), Josh Groban, C√©line Dion, Chaka Khan, Donna Summer, Dionne Warwick, The Pointer Sisters, Meat Loaf, Patti LaBelle, Hall & Oates, BB Mak, Bill Champlin, Al Jarreau, Leona Lewis and many others. He was the lead vocalist on a tune written by Donald Fagen called \\"Green Flower Street\\", which appeared on the 2000 album entitled \\"Birdland\\" by Masanori Sasaji and the L.A. Allstars.Discogs Page performed his own material in December 2008 for the first time since Shelter Me. The song entitled \\"I Always Cry at Christmas\\" was co-written with Walter Afanasieff. In 2010 Page released two of his own song collections, Peculiar Life, which he recorded, noting that writing for others was not as satisfying as writing a song for himself, especially when it entailed compromises. In the same year, he also released the album 5 Songs for Christmas. These were followed by Solo Acoustic (2011) and Songs from the Sketchbook (2012). Based on a recommendation by his friend, songwriter Richard Marx, Ringo Starr approached Page to join his 11th All-Starr Band and, in the summer of 2010, they embarked on a 32-date U.S. tour and, then in 2011, they embarked on a 40-date Europe tour. Page also toured with Ringo's 12th All- Starr Band in the summer of 2012, 2013, and 2017. On its first tour, Ringo Starr‚Äôs All-Starr Band also included keyboardists Edgar Winter and Gary Wright, guitarists Rick Derringer and Wally Palmar, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. Personal life Richard lives with his wife Linda in Malibu in southern California. They have 4 children.

Fulgens and Lucrece (c.1497), whose heroine must choose between two suitors, is the earliest known secular English play. The other play of Medwall is titled Nature. He stayed at the court of Cardinal Morton, Chancellor in the time of Henry VII. Life Born in 1462, he was educated at Eton College from 1475, at age 13, and was admitted to King's College, Cambridge in 1480. He left King's in 1483. Under Henry VII he acted as a notary, and acquired a civil law degree. With a living at Balinghem in English Calais, he is assumed to have worked for John Morton at Lambeth Palace. Updated version. He vanishes from the record after 1501. Works Fulgens and Lucrece is based on a Latin work by Buonaccorso da Montemagno. The other work of Medwall's that is extant is Nature.Nature: a goodly interlude of Nature pylyd by mayster Henry Medwall, chapleyn to the ryght reverend father in god Johan Morton, somtyme cardynall and archebyshop of Canterbury, b. l. folio, 36 leaves. It is without date, place, or printer's name, but was printed by William Rastell. Nature was produced before Morton in Henry VII's reign; John Bale states that it was translated into Latin. Another interlude that has been ascribed to Medwall, Of the Finding of Truth, carried away by Ignorance and Hypocrisy, was said to have introduced a fool, an innovation which commended it to Henry VIII when it was produced before him at Richmond, Christmas 1516; the king, however, left early. This is now thought to be a fabrication, perhaps by John Payne Collier.

Produced by David Crosby, the album was recorded in 1967 at Sunset Sound and released in March 1968 by record label Reprise. Production The album was recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California during the later part of 1967. David Crosby was assigned as producer as part of the deal with Reprise Records. Crosby wanted Mitchell to sound pure and natural, so he asked her to sing into the studio grand piano, and set up extra microphones to capture her voice reverberating off the strings; unfortunately the set-up captured too much ambient noise, resulting in excessive tape hiss, which could only be removed post-production at the cost of the high sounds in the audio range, which gives the album a flat feel. Mitchell had written songs that were hits for other artists (e.g., \\"Both Sides Now\\" and \\"Chelsea Morning\\" by Judy Collins and Dave Van Ronk, \\"Eastern Rain\\" by Fairport Convention, \\"Urge for Going\\" and \\"The Circle Game\\" by Tom Rush), but none of those songs were recorded for her debut.

Though the process and motivations for codification are similar in different common law and civil law systems, their usage is different. In a civil law country, a code of law typically exhaustively covers the complete system of law, such as civil law or criminal law. By contrast, in a common law country with legislative practices in the English tradition, modify the existing common law only to the extent of its express or implicit provision, but otherwise leaves the common law intact. A code entirely replaces the common law in a particular area, leaving the common law inoperative unless and until the code is repealed. In a third case of slightly different usage, in the United States and other common law countries that have adopted similar legislative practices, a code of law is a standing body of statute law on a particular area, which is added to, subtracted from, or otherwise modified by individual legislative enactments.  History  The legal code was a common feature of the legal systems of the ancient Middle East. The Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100-2050 BC), then the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BC), are among the earliest and best preserved legal codes, originating in the Fertile Crescent. In the Roman empire, a number of codifications were developed, such as the Twelve Tables of Roman law (first compiled in 450 BC) and the Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian, also known as the Justinian Code (429 - 534 AD). However, these law codes did not exhaustively describe the Roman legal system. The Twelve Tables were limited in scope, and most legal doctrines were developed by the pontifices, who \\"interpreted\\" the tables to deal with situations far beyond what is contained therein. The Justinian Code collected together existing legal material at the time. In ancient China, the first comprehensive criminal code was the Tang Code, created in 624 AD in the Tang Dynasty. This, and subsequent imperial codes, formed the basis for the penal system of both China and other East Asian states under its cultural influence. The last and best preserved imperial code is the Great Qing Legal Code, created in 1644 upon the founding of the Qing Dynasty. This code was the exclusive and exhaustive statement of Chinese law between 1644 and 1912. Though it was in form a criminal code, large parts of the code dealt with civil law matters and the settlement of civil disputes. The Code ceased its operation upon the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, but significant provisions remained in operation in Hong Kong until well into the 1970s due to a peculiar interaction between it and the British common law system. In Europe, Roman law, especially the Corpus Juris Civilis, became the basis of the legal systems of many countries. Roman law was either adopted by legislation (becoming positive law), or through processing by jurists. The accepted Roman law is usually then codified and forms part of the central Code. The codification movement gathered pace after the rise of nation-states after the Treaty of Westphalia. Prominent national civil codes include the Napoleonic Code (code civil) of 1804, the German civil code (B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch) of 1900 and the Swiss codes. The European codifications of the 1800s influenced the codification of Catholic canon lawDr. Edward N. Peters, CanonLaw.info, accessed 7-15-2014 resulting in the 1917 Code of Canon Law which was replaced by the 1983 Code of Canon Law and whose Eastern counterpart is the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. Meanwhile, African civilizations developed their own legal traditions, sometimes codifying them through consistent oral tradition, as illustrated e.g. by the Kouroukan Fouga, a charter proclaimed by the Mali Empire in 1222-1236, enumerating regulations in both constitutional and civil matters, and transmitted to this day by griots under oath. The Continental civil law tradition spread around the world along with European cultural and military dominance in recent centuries. During the Meiji Restoration, Japan adopted a new Civil Code (1898), based primarily on the French civil code and influenced by the German code. After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 in China, the new Republic of China government abandoned the imperial code tradition and instead adopted a new civil code strongly influenced by the German B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch, and also influenced by the Japanese code. This new tradition has been largely maintained in the legal system of the People's Republic of China since 1949. Meanwhile, codifications also became more common in common law systems. For example, a criminal code is found in a number of common law jurisdictions in Australia and the Americas, and continues to be debated in England. In the Americas, the influence of Continental legal codes has manifest itself in two ways. In civil law jurisdictions, legal codes in the Continental tradition are common. In common law jurisdictions, however, there has been a strong trend towards codification. The result of such codification, however, is not always a legal code as found in civil law jurisdictions. For example, the California Civil Code largely codifies common law doctrine and is very different in form and content from all other civil codes.  Civil code  A civil code typically forms the core of civil law systems. The legal Code typically covers exhaustively the entire system of private law. Civil codes are always also found in common especially in the United States of America. However, such civil codes are often collections of common law rules and a variety of ad hoc statutes; that is, they do not aspire to complete logical coherence.  Criminal code  A criminal code or penal code is a common feature in many legal systems. Codification of the criminal law allows the criminal law to be more accessible and more democratically made and amended.

Referencing Solondz's previous Welcome to the Dollhouse, it was nominated for the Golden Lion award at the 61st Venice International Film Festival. The protagonist, a 13-year-old girl named Aviva, is played by eight different actors of different ages, races, and genders during the course of the film, which features an array of secondary characters. The names of the characters Aviva, Bob, and Otto are all palindromes. Plot The film opens with a funeral for Dawn Wiener (the protagonist from Solondz's Welcome to the Dollhouse), who went to college, gained a lot of weight, and committed suicide at age 20 after she became pregnant. Her older brother Mark (Matthew Faber, reprising his role) reads the eulogy while Dawn's tearful parents (Angela Pietropinto and Bill Buell, also reprising their roles) sit in the audience. Dawn's younger sister whom she was estranged from, Missy, does not attend the funeral. One of the attendees is Aviva, Dawn's cousin. A few years later, Aviva desires to have a child. She has sex with Judah (Robert Agri), a family friend, and becomes pregnant. Aviva's parents are horrified and demand that she get an abortion. While the abortion is technically successful, it is implied via a fractured, emotional conversation with the doctor (Stephen Singer) that Aviva can no longer have children. Not fully conscious, Aviva is unaware of this, and her parents, already fragile, lead her to believe all is well when she awakens, afraid to upset Aviva. Aviva runs away from home. She befriends a trucker (Stephen Adly Guirgis) and has sex with him; however, the trucker abandons her at a motel. She is eventually found by the Sunshine Family, a Christian fundamentalist foster home that cares for disordered orphans and runaways. She tells them her name is Henrietta -- the name she picked for the baby she was persuaded to abort. While at the Sunshine Family home, she discovers a dark side to the foster father; he assassinates abortion providers. His next target is the doctor who performed Aviva's abortion. The hitman whom the foster father uses is the same trucker Aviva previously befriended and had sex with. Convinced she is in love with the truck driver, Aviva flees the Sunshine Family to join him on his assignment. The murder does not go as planned as, in addition to the doctor himself, the trucker (whose name is revealed to be Bob) ends up accidentally shooting the doctor's young daughter when she steps in front of the first shot. The police find Bob and Aviva both in a motel room, and a guilt-ridden Bob commits suicide by cop. The film then skips ahead several months later to Aviva back home with her parents, planning her next birthday party. During the party, she talks to her cousin, Mark, who has recently been arrested and accused of molesting his sister Missy's baby (although he denies having done it and its loosely implied that Missy might have made it up for attention.). Mark tells Aviva that there is no such thing as free will; people are what they were genetically ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù to be, and can never truly change. The film skips ahead to Aviva's meeting Judah, who now calls himself Otto, and they have sex again. Afterward, Aviva happily exclaims that she has a feeling that, this time, she is going to be a mother. Casting Palindromes is most notable for having eight different actors of different ages, races, and genders play a 13-year- old girl named Aviva. Although Solondz's film premiered in official competition at the Venice Film Festival in 2004, it received little other laudatory notice and remains his most polarizing with critics.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/palindromes/reviews/?type=top_criticshttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362004/awards?ref_=tt_awd With regard to Solondz's employment of multiple performers to play a single character, film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his positive review, \\"If the movie is a moral labyrinth, it is paradoxically straightforward and powerful in the moment; each individual story has an authenticity and impact of its own. Consider the pathos brought to Aviva by the actress Sharon Wilkins, who is a plus-size adult black woman playing a little girl, and who creates perhaps the most convincing little girl of them all. Or Jennifer Jason Leigh, three times as old as Aviva but barely seeming her age. These individual segments are so effective that at the end of each one we know how we feel, and why. It's just that the next segment invalidates our conclusions.\\" Contrarily, New York Times film critic A. O. Scott concluded in his negative review, \\"[...] Aviva's appearance changes -- from black to white, from fat to thin, from brunette to redhead, and at one point, to Jennifer Jason Leigh. The effect of this switching is to keep you off balance and at a remove from the story. That is not such a bad thing, because you will want to be as far away as possible.\\" Cast * Matthew Faber as Mark Wiener * Angela Pietropinto as Mrs. Wiener * Bill Buell as Harvey Wiener * Ellen Barkin as Joyce Victor * Richard Masur as Steve Victor * Hillary Bailey Smith as Robin Wallace * Danton Stone as Bruce Wallace * Robert Agri as First Judah * John Gemberling as Second Judah * Stephen Singer as Dr. Fleisher * Stephen Adly Guirgis as Joe/Earl/Bob * Debra Monk as Mama Sunshine * Walter Bobbie as Bo Sunshine * Tyler Maynard as Jiminy * David Castro as Carlito * Richard Riehle as Dr. Dan * Maggie Moore as Voice of Christian narrator *Sydney Matuszak Ell =Actors playing Aviva= * Emani Sledge (segment 'Dawn') * Valerie Shusterov (segment 'Judah') * Hannah Freiman (segment 'Henry') * Rachel Corr (segment 'Henrietta') * Will Denton (segment 'Huckleberry') * Sharon Wilkins (segment 'Mama Sunshine') * Shayna Levine (segment 'Bob') * Jennifer Jason Leigh (segment 'Mark') Reception Palindromes currently holds a 43% rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 120 reviews with an average rating of 5.31/10.

Early life Born at Worcester, Massachusetts, he left school at the age of 16, and after gaining experience in various book shops, founded the Western Book and Stationery Company at Denver Colorado. He sold books to the western states making use of the United States Postal Service. Rights to and purchase of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica He moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1893 to join the firm of James Clark, publishers of cheap editions. He marketed their reprint of the Century Dictionary using mail order and credit by installment terms, to great success. He visited England in 1897 and saw that the 9th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica could be marketed in the same way. He also noted that The Times suffered flagging sales, and hit on the idea of using the latter to market the former ‚Äî to their mutual benefit. He secured the reprint rights to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and The Times reissued it. Within three months 10,000 sets were sold and within five years the total had reached 50,000. Hooper bought the copyright, and set about the production of eleven additional volumes to make the 10th edition, which was published by The Times in 1902-3. The Times appointed Hooper as advertising manager, and in 1905 he set up the Times Book Club, managed by Janet Hogarth. After the purchase of The Times by Lord Northcliffe, Hooper left the company in 1908. He set about the production of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition which was published 1910-11. This was published in two blocks of volumes instead of the volumes appearing serially over a number of years. Hooper established the Britannica Year-Book, the first volume being published in 1913. He produced the Handy Volume edition (1915‚Äì1916) specifically for mail-order. This was a photographic reprint of the 11th edition, and was often sold with an accompanying book case. Sale of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Hooper sold the copyright to Sears Roebuck in 1920 but oversaw the publication in 1922 of the 12th edition - three volumes covering the events of World War I with a reprint of the eleventh edition.

He is the drummer for the rock band Fall Out Boy. Prior to Fall Out Boy, Hurley played in several hardcore punk bands. He joined Fall Out Boy as the full-time drummer in 2003 and was in the band's lineup until its hiatus in 2009. Following that, he formed the heavy metal supergroup The Damned Things with Fall Out Boy guitarist Joe Trohman; the group went on hiatus after its debut album, Ironiclast (2010), due to band members focusing on their original bands' new album cycles. Hurley moved on to hardcore punk band Enabler which released a debut album and toured in 2012. Fall Out Boy regrouped and announced a new album and tour on February 4, 2013. The band's fifth studio album, Save Rock and Roll, was released April 16, 2013, with the punk EP PAX AM Days announced on September 30 and was released on October 15 the same year. The band's sixth studio album American Beauty/American Psycho was released on January 16, 2015 and debuted at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200. Early life Hurley was born in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. He was brought up by his mother, who worked as a nurse; his father died when he was five. In middle school, his first instrument was the saxophone but in high school he switched to drums after his sister bought him the albums Ride the Lightning and Van Halen. Hurley attended Menomonee Falls High School and played percussion in bands, citing Dave Lombardo as his biggest influence when growing up and Metallica as his favourite band. Eventually, he simultaneously became interested in death metal and crossover thrash, and shortly afterward hardcore punk and metalcore bands such as Earth Crisis. After high school, he attended University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, double-majoring in anthropology and history, while he played with three bands.Olson, Drew (May 17, 2007). \\"Milwaukee native Hurley keeps the beat for Fall Out Boy\\", OnMilwaukee.com. Retrieved on 2007-05-19. Personal life and views Hurley is the only member of Fall Out Boy to remain straight edge. He has been vegan since he was 16. Hurley identifies himself as an anarcho-primitivist, explaining that this means he believes that humans are supposed to live the way they lived prior to 10,000 years ago. When asked about this in the February 2007 issue of Alternative Press, he said that his career contradicted his beliefs, but at the same time, he had to make a living. Hurley is a CrossFit athlete. Musical career Hurley played in heavy metal and hardcore punk bands including Racetraitor, Killtheslavemaster, Project Rocket, xFor Death or Gloryx, The Kill Pill, and Arma Angelus. In 1999, he was a guest drummer on Vegan Reich's \\"Jihad\\" EP. Hurley joined Fall Out Boy in 2003 after the band's debut mini-LP Fall Out Boy's Evening Out With Your Girlfriend and recorded Take This to Your Grave (2003). Hurley had been friends with bassist Pete Wentz since he was 16, and he first filled in on a touring position as drummer for Fall Out Boy before joining the band as full-time drummer. Fall Out Boy is the fourth band Hurley has been in with Wentz. With Fall Out Boy, Hurley has achieved major commercial success and toured the world. Hurley has a record label, Fuck City, which has released music by Misery Signals, Peregrine (led by anarcho-primitivist writer Kevin Tucker), and Auryn. During Fall Out Boy's hiatus from 2009‚Äì2013, Hurley was the drummer for the heavy metal band The Damned Things, which featured members of Anthrax, Fall Out Boy and Every Time I Die and released debut album Ironiclast. He has also played in the Milwaukee hardcore band Enabler. It released a full album entitled All Hail The Void in Summer 2012. Hurley is also part of other rock bands. In late 2012, Hurley began playing drums in Milwaukee-based straight edge hardcore band, FocusedXMinds. It was rumored that the return of Fall Out Boy would end his time with the band, but Hurley confirmed on Twitter on March 12 that \\"I am in it for life.\\" On February 4, 2013, Fall Out Boy unexpectedly announced their return, along with an album and single with which all four members, including Hurley, contributed. April 12 of the same year, the band released a new album entitled, Save Rock and Roll, featuring the lead single \\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up),\\" and dates for a new tour. The band played their first show in over three years on the night of February 4 in Chicago. 'Save Rock and Roll' peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 154,000 copies in its first week, becoming the band's 4th consecutive top 10 album. With Fall Out Boy, Hurley toured heavily throughout 2013 and 2014 on the album, selling out arenas worldwide with bands Paramore on the Monumentour. In October 2013, they released a new EP, PAX AM Days which they recorded in a two-day session with producer Ryan Adams. Sixth studio album American Beauty/American Psycho was released to become the band's third Billboard 200 No. 1 album, debuting with 192,000 first week sales and 218,000 equivalent album units. The album was preceded by the triple Platinum top 10 single Centuries. Uma Thurman was released to mainstream radio on April 14, 2014 and peaked at 22 on the 'Billboard' Top 100, and were certified as Platinum in August 2015. In 2016 Hurley started a vegan straight edge hardcore band called SECT composed of Chris Colohan (Cursed, Burning Love, Left for Dead and The Swarm) on vocals, James Chang (Catharsis, Undying) and Scott Crouse (Earth Crisis, Path of Resistance) on guitar, and Steve Hart (Day Of Suffering) on bass. They have released two albums so far. In April 2017, Fall Out Boy released Young and Menace, the lead single for the seventh studio album. The band's seventh album Mania was officially released January 19, 2018 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making it the band's third consecutive and fourth chart-topping debut overall. In 2018 Fall Out Boy headlined Wrigley Field in the band's hometown of Chicago, marking a milestone in their career as their first headline show at a stadium.

Designed in the art deco style by David Evelyn Nye in 1936, the cinema opened to the public in 1938. After 50 years of service, the cinema closed in 1988 and became derelict. The building was listed Grade II by English Heritage, and following a campaign to save the Rex by a local entrepreneur, the cinema re- opened to the public in 2004. Today, the cinema is a fully operational independent cinema, screening films 362 days of the year. The programme ranges from vintage classic films to modern blockbusters which often attract large box office queues. History Prior to the development of the Rex Cinema, Egerton House, an Elizabethan mansion had stood on the site for approximately 350 years. Built during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the house was latterly noted for its literary association with J. M. Barrie, author of Peter Pan, through its brief occupancy by the Llewelyn Davies family. Egerton House was demolished in 1937 to make way for the Rex Cinema. In the 1930s, a cinema was already in operation in Berkhamsted High Street, the Court Cinema on the corner of Water Lane. It was acquired around 1930 by the Shipman & King cinema circuit, who also planned to open a second cinema in the town. Originally they intended to build on a site at the eastern end of town on the corner of Swing Gate Lane, but in 1936 S&K; acquired Egerton House, a site closer to the centre of town which had spacious grounds for a cinema and car park. Egerton House was demolished and the Rex Cinema was erected in its place. The cinema was opened on 9 May 1938 by Viscountess Davidson, and the first screening was the film Heidi, starring Shirley Temple. In the 1970s, business waned and the Rex was no longer commercially successful. In January 1973 it was taken over by the Star Group, who renamed the cinema Studio 1. Films were shown Sunday to Wednesday, and Thursday-Sunday the building was given over to the more commercially lucrative pastime of bingo, like so many cinemas in this period. The dining room was filled with fruit machines. In 1976 the cinema changed hands once more and was taken over by the gambling company Zetters, who made major alterations to the building by dividing the auditorium into three sections. The last film to be screened on the big screen before this change was Rollerball on 7 April 1976. The circle was divided into two small studio screens, Studio 1 and Studio 2 (accessed via the front foyer stairs), while the stalls were converted to use as a full-time bingo hall (accessed through the old caf√© area). The studios opened on 11 April with Swinging Wives and Sex in the Office in Studio 1 and The Bruce Lee Story and Somebody's Stolen our Russian Spy in Studio 2. =Closure= Exterior of the Rex (2011) Zetters' lease expired in 1988 and the Rex was sold to a property developer who planned to demolish the building to make way for new offices and flats. After a final screening of The Witches of Eastwick and Teen Wolf Too, the cinema closed its doors on 28 February 1988. Efforts by campaigners resulted in the Rex being spot-listed by English Heritage. A planning inspector for the Department of the Environment reported that Nye's building contributed to the \\"diverse nature\\" of Berkhamsted High Street and that the quality and quantity of the surviving interior features merited preservation, and redevelopment plans were quashed. The building's listed status protected it from demolition and severely limited any redevelopment schemes. Various proposals were put forward for the site, including: a plan to convert the Rex auditorium into an atrium for an office building (1992); a proposal for an office complex with twin lecture theatres in the divided circle with a restored restaurant area (1993), and a plan to convert the building into a health spa (1997); these all failed to meet the strict criteria for a listed building. A fire in 1994 damaged the stage area. By this time the building had become very run down and the owners, Estates and General Property Company, attempted to have the building de-listed to enable demolition. In 1996, they attempted to dispose of the property and offered it to local entrepreneur James Hannaway for ¬£450,000. Hannaway hoped to restore and re-open the cinema, but was unable to raise the money, and the Rex was bought by Nicholas King Homes. A local campaign group, Friends of the Rex, was formed in 1997 with the aim of saving the Rex from demolition and acquiring it for use as a film centre, with film critic Barry Norman as their honorary president. The campaign was supported by the Twentieth Century Society, Joan Bakewell, and actors Hugh Grant, Hayley Mills and Ian Richardson. Campaigners formed the Rex Film and Arts Centre Trust to put forward a number of commercial proposals for a leisure complex including cinema screens, a swimming pool and a pub. The dilapidated state of the Rex was discussed in the House of Commons; Tom Clarke of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to offer government subsidy for restoring the Rex, and the local MP Richard Page took the view that the Rex was now an eyesore and should be de-listed and demolished to make way for sheltered housing. =Redevelopment and re-opening= The original entrance foyer, now The Gatsby bar and restaurant The proposal from property developer Nicholas King Homes, which envisaged building an apartment block around the cinema (replacing the neighbouring shop fronts) and converting the Rex foyer into a bar and restaurant, was successful, and conversion of the site began in 2000. In 2001, Hannaway won the contract to restore the cinema interior; with a team of volunteer workers, he pulled down the partition walls and restored the auditorium to single-screen function. The project applied unsuccessfully for National Lottery funding and instead raised funds by selling membership and asking supporters to sponsor a seat. Actor Bill Nighy was among the first to contribute to the effort. The dilapidated interior was restored to its 1930s glory and leased to Hannaway for use once more as a cinema. The cinema re- opened to the public in December 2004 with a screening of The Third Man, a film of particular significance as it was made during the heyday of the original Rex and the screenplay was by Berkhamsted writer Graham Greene. The re-opening of the Rex doors to the public was acclaimed by critics; the Daily Telegraph remarked in 2006 that the luxurious facilities of the Rex and notable lack of popcorn were \\"the cinematic equivalent of turning left on a long-haul flight\\" (a reference to flying first class), and suggested that the guest appearance by Dame Judi Dench had been overlooked by local media only because of the major Buncefield fire which occurred that day. After the success of the Rex restoration, Hannaway went on to a second cinema project. After a public campaign and fundraising scheme, he led a project to restore a derelict Art Deco cinema in nearby St Albans, which re-opened in November 2014 as the Odyssey Cinema, St Albans. Architecture The protruding projection room the 1938 dining room Blue plaque commemorating the architect Nye The Rex was designed in a striking Art Deco style by architect David Evelyn Nye. When the cinema was opened, the main entrance to the Rex was on the corner of the High Street, with a curved concrete canopy and tall vertical windows illuminating the double-height entrance foyer. Within the foyer, a large Art Deco chandelier hung from a decorated ceiling above a curved island ticket booth. In those days, cinemagoers would access the auditorium either via steps up to the stalls or via the two staircases which swept up to a central door to the circle seats. The auditorium was placed at 90¬∞ to the foyer, extending across the site parallel to the main road. To maximise the space, the projection booth was built into an exterior balcony protruding form the building above Three Close Lane, supported by large concrete brackets. It was accessed by an external iron staircase to reduce the fire risk of bringing flammable nitrate film reels into the theatre. A joke shared among local residents was that the architect had forgotten to add a projection room and that this box was added later. As space was at a premium in the circle, a caf√© and dining room was located on the ground floor behind the stalls and the foyer, with the result that the circle had more seats than the stalls. The interior design of the Rex included a variety of ornate features; the designer is not known but it is assumed to be the work of Mollo and Egan who collaborated with Nye on other cinema interiors. The Rex interior featured stylised floral stucco friezes around the dining room, a striking decorated foyer ceiling rose, and the nautical flavour set by Nye's dining room porthole windows was continued with the addition of scallop shell-shaped light fittings and stucco waves in the auditorium. The main screen itself was surrounded by an ornate proscenium, with Art Deco floral designs obscuring the ventilation grilles. Since the cinema's dereliction and later re-opening, some of the original features have been lost; the chandelier and the ticket booth were removed after the 1976 Zetter takeover. The auditorium was divided in 1976 into two circle studio screens, while the stalls were used as a bingo hall. However, despite these alterations, most of the original fabric and decoration survived the years of decline, enough to merit spot-listing by English Heritage in 1988, and in 1990 the Department of the Environment recommended that the Rex be preserved. Following the 2004 redevelopment, the refurbished Rex is smaller, having 350 seats compared to the original capacity of 1100 (due to the larger leg-room and provision of swivel chairs and cocktail tables). The refurbishment was sympathetic to the cinema's Art Deco heritage, notably with the installation of a new chandelier and new period style mirrors. The work also brought about a major change to the building by separating the entire ground floor from the main cinema operation and converting it into a bar and restaurant. The decorated entrance foyer and dining room are now home to The Gatsby bar and restaurant, named in homage to the 1949 film The Great Gatsby whose poster hangs above the bar, in front of the former cinema entrance at the top of the (now disused) staircase. Cinema audiences now gain access to the cinema, via a staircase and side entrance, to a more modest entrance foyer and box office which are located in an area underneath the stalls on the first floor. The ground floor stalls, accessed via stairs in the auditorium, are now laid out with lounge chairs and tables. A plaque inside the cinema, unveiled on 14 February 1979 by actress Jane Asher, commemorates the site's association with J.M. Barrie and Peter Pan.

Legislation effective in 1997 states that a Norwegian city/town (same word in Norwegian) must have at least 5,000 inhabitants, but Honningsv√•g was declared a city in 1996, thus exempt from this legislation, so it is also one of the smallest cities in Norway. The town has a population (2017) of 2,484 which gives the town a population density of . Honningsv√•g is situated at a bay on the southeastern side of the large island of Mager√∏ya, while the famous North Cape and its visitor center is on the northern side of the island. Honningsv√•g is a port of call for cruise ships, especially in the summer months. The ice-free ocean (southwestern part of the Barents Sea) provides rich fisheries and tourism is also important to the town. Even at 71¬∞N, many private gardens in Honningsv√•g have trees, although rarely more than tall. The famous dog Bamse came from Honningsv√•g. Transportation Honningsv√•g is one of the main stops of the Hurtigruten coastal ships on their lengthy route along the Norwegian coast between Kirkenes in the north and Bergen in the south. The northbound ships to Kirkenes dock in the port from 11:15 to 14:45, generating heavy tourist activity in the city. The southbound ships to Bergen make a short stop around 05:30. Honningsv√•g Airport, Valan, located north of the town, provides flights mainly to Troms√∏, with connecting flights to Oslo. History Winter sky in Honningsv√•g The area was first settled in prehistory, as early as 10,300 years ago. The sea was probably the main food source. =City status= Honningsv√•g was declared a town in 1996 by the municipal council of Nordkapp. National legislation was passed in 1997 that states that a Norwegian city must have at least 5,000 inhabitants, but since Honningsv√•g was declared a city in 1996, it was exempt from this legislation. This makes it one of the smallest cities in Norway. =Name= The Old Norse form of the name was probably Hornungsv√°gr. The first element is then the genitive case of the (hypothetical) name of a mountain, Hornungr, which has since fallen into disuse. Hornungr could have been an older name of mount Storefjell (literally \\"big mountain\\"), a tall and hornlike peak near Honningsv√•g, which would imply that the name was derived from the word horn.

The Games likely began in 1612 and ran (through a period of discontinuations and revivals) until they were fully discontinued in 1852. However, they were revived in 1963 and still continue as of 2020. http://www.visitgloucester.co.uk/whats-on/robert-dovers-cotswold-olimpick- games-p163083, Robert Dover's Cotswold Olimpick Games The Olimpick Games were started by a local lawyer, Robert Dover, with the approval of King James I. Dover's motivation in organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm, but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together; the Games were attended by all classes of society, including royalty on one occasion. Events included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes, and abundant food was supplied for everyone who attended. A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what is now known as Dover's Hill, complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events. The Games took place on the Thursday and Friday of the week of Whitsun, normally between mid-May and mid- June. Many 17th-century Puritans disapproved of such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as Whitsun. By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, bringing the Games to an end. Revived after the Restoration, the Games gradually degenerated into a drunk and disorderly country festival according to their critics. The Games ended again in 1852, when the common land on which they had been staged was partitioned between local landowners and farmers and subsequently enclosed. Since 1966 the Games have been held each year on the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday. Events have included the tug of war, gymkhana, shin-kicking, dwile flonking, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, and morris dancing. The British Olympic Association has recognised the Cotswold Olimpick Games as \\"the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings\\". Origins The first Olimpick Games were likely held in 1612, organised by lawyer Robert Dover, although different sources give dates from 1601 until 1612. Little is known about Dover. He was probably born between 1575 and 1582 in Norfolk, one of four children born to John Dover, and may have been admitted to Queens' College at Cambridge in 1583, leaving early to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy. Dover was admitted to Gray's Inn on 27 February 1636, and was probably called to the bar in 1611, the same year he likely moved to Saintbury, near Chipping Campden, with his wife and children. It is unclear whether Dover began the Games from scratch, or took over from an existing event, perhaps a church ale. The Games had the approval of King James, who in his book of advice to his son, Basilikon Doron (1599), had written that to promote good feeling among the common people towards their king, \\"certain days in the year would be appointed, for delighting the people with public spectacles of all honest games, and exercise of arms\\". Although there was at that time in England a growing admiration for the ancient Greeks, Dover may have been motivated by military rather than cultural considerations. His biographer, Christopher Whitfield, claimed that Dover combined ancient countryside practices with \\"classical mythology and Renaissance culture, whilst linking them with the throne and the King's Protestant Church\\". Dover believed that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the kingdom. He may also have believed that the Games would bring rich and poor together, increasing social harmony, an ideal that might explain why the event captured the public imagination; the poetry of the period eulogises the Games as \\"an occasion of social harmony and communal joy\\". Endymion Porter, a member of the court of King James, had an estate in the village of Aston-sub-Edge, close to Dover's home. Dover acted as Porter's legal agent between 1622 and 1640, and through him James sent some of his own clothes to Dover, \\"purposely to grace him and consequently the solemnity [of the Games]\\". James may also have granted Dover a coat of arms, with the motto \\"Do Ever Good\\", as claimed by Dover's grandson, a claim that was rejected by the heraldic authorities in 1682. The Annalia Dubrensia (Annals of Dover), a collection of poems praising Dover and his achievements in promoting and managing the Games, was published in 1636. The contributors included well-known poets such as Michael Drayton, Ben Jonson, Thomas Randolph, and Thomas Heywood. They saw the Games as revitalising traditional English social life, and they countered opposition from the critics of such events, who complained of \\"drunken behaviour and sexual licence\\", by stressing the \\"peaceful and well-behaved\\" nature of the occasion, and even praising the Games as \\"a gesture of loyalty to the king\\". The Games had acquired their title of \\"Olimpicks\\" by the time the Annalia Dubrensia was published, a name approved of by Dover. It secularised the proceedings, while adding an air a gentrification to the sports by linking them with the Olympics of ancient Greece. Having been brought up in a Catholic family, Dover might well have been keen not to draw attention to religion, particularly if the Games had taken over from an earlier church ale. Proceedings The Games took place in a natural amphitheatre on what is known today as Dover's Hill, then called Kingcombe Plain, above the town of Chipping Campden, in Gloucestershire. They were held on the Thursday and Friday of Whit-Week, or the week of Whitsun, which normally fell between mid-May and mid-June. Dover presided over the Games on horseback, dressed ceremonially in a coat, hat, feather and ruff, donated by King James. Horses and men were decorated with Dover's favours, yellow ribbons pinned to a hat or worn around the arm, leg, or neck. Tents were erected for the gentry, who came from the surrounding counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire, and food was supplied in abundance. The poet Nicholas Wallington wrote that: The Cotswold Olympicks, 2007 opening, Dover's Hill A temporary wooden building was constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were summoned to the hillside by the sound of a hunting horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events. The contests were refereed by officials called sticklers, from which the phrase \\"a stickler for the rules\\" is derived. Sticklers were so-named because they carried sticks, with which to safely separate two fighting swordsmen. No scores or times are recorded for any of the events. Portable watches of the time were \\"rare, costly, and relatively unreliable devices\\", but perhaps just as importantly \\"nobody in Dover's time was much interested in sports record- keeping or record-breaking\\". Visitors from all strata of society attended, from agricultural labourers to the nobility, some of whom travelled up to to attend the Games. Prince Rupert attended in 1636. =Other diversions= A harper dressed as the Greek poet Homer entertained the crowds, enhancing the classical Olympic theme. There was also a maze, known as a Troy Town, constructed from piled up turf with walls about high, through which villagers would dance. Various games were played for small stakes in booths and tents, including chess, Irisha game similar to backgammonand card games such as cent, a game like piquet. King James approved of card games \\"when you have no other thing ado ... and are weary of reading ... and when it is foul and stormy weather\\", but he considered chess to be \\"too obsessive a game\\". The Games ended with a grand firework display, centred on the castle. Controversy In the 17th century many Puritans believed that the slightest action might lead to sin, and even to Hell if it was not repented. They frowned on festivities such as the Games as being of pagan origin, promoting immorality and drunkenness, and disapproved of any celebration on a church holiday such as Whitsun. A Puritan revolt over a 1627 \\"Bringing in the May\\" festival at Mount Wollaston in present-day Massachusetts resulted in the expulsion of its organiser from the colony. King James, on the other hand, viewed Puritanism as a challenge to the authority of the monarch. The fine clothes donated by the King, which Dover wore when he presided over the Games, were not just a fashion statement, but also a political one. The feather in Dover's hat was a \\"flag of defiance to virtue\\" in Puritan eyes, and even the starch probably used in the washing of his ruff was evil, according to the Puritan writer Philip Stubbes. He described starch as \\"[a] certain kind of liquid matter ... wherein the Devil hath learned them [non-Puritans] to wash and die their ruffs\\". James was succeeded by King Charles I in 1625. The new king reluctantly consented to an Act of Parliament \\"for punishing divers abuses on the Lord's Day, called Sunday\\". The Act restricted the activities that were allowed to take place on a Sunday, and prohibited any meetings of people outside their own parishes on Sunday. Many Puritan landowners went even further, forbidding their workers to attend any church ales, culminating in two Somerset circuit judges ruling in 1632 that \\"all public ales be henceforth utterly suppressed\\". The following year Charles reversed the judges' ruling of 1632. He produced a new version of James's Book of Sports, which he ordered to be read in every church. In it he wrote: The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 brought the Games to an end. First revival, 1660‚Äì1850 The Games were revived at some uncertain date after the Restoration of 1660. Dover had died in 1652, and bereft of his influence, the Games became \\"just another drunken country festival\\", according to an account written by the poet William Somervile in 1740. By then the Games, known as Dover's Meeting, were well established and once again quite popular, and included events such as backsword fighting. It is unclear whether the contestants fought with metal or wooden swords, but there is no doubt that very real danger was involved. During a fight at the beginning of the 19th century, one of the contestants was so badly injured that he died soon afterwards. The wrestling competitions had become shin-kicking contests, with competitors wearing heavily nailed boots, sometimes with pointed tips. The poet and writer Richard Graves described the Games in his picaresque novel The Spiritual Quixote (1773) as a \\"heathenish assembly\\". Somervile's account of the 1740 Games describes a general riot in which \\"chairs, and forms, and battered bowls are hurled/With fell intent; like bombs the bottles fly\\". Graves dramatised the enthusiasm for the women's race for a Holland shift displayed on a pole: \\"six young women began to exhibit themselves before the whole assembly, in a dress hardly reconcilable to the rules of decency\\". By 1845 the Games were being organised by a local publican, William Drury, who paid ¬£5 for the right to do so. He hired out space for stalls and booths, and presumably sold alcohol at the event. The rector of Weston-sub-Edge, the parish in which Dover's Hill is located, Reverend Geoffrey Drinkwater Bourne, claimed that up to 30,000 people were attending the Games by then, and that the hillside was full of drunk and disorderly individuals. Bourne also claimed that: Such accounts may have been exaggerated however, as there are few reports of police being called to the Games, and no court records of prosecutions for drunkenness or fighting. The staging of the Games depended on the existence of a suitably large area of common land, but by the mid-19th century much of England's common land was being partitioned up and fenced off. Consent for the enclosure of the parish of Weston-sub-Edge was given in 1850, signalling the end of the Games in 1852. The parish's were divided among local farmers and landowners; Reverend Bourne, who a few years earlier had complained so vociferously about the Games, received . Shakespearean connection Some historians have suggested that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain whether or not it was written by Shakespeare. The first Shakespearean scholars to make a connection between Dover and Shakespeare were Samuel Johnson, George Steevens, Thomas Warton, and Edmond Malone; historian Jean Wilson has commented that it required \\"quite imaginative leaps such as a hill referred to by Bolingbroke [King Henry IV of England] being the hill on which the games were held\\". More recently, the historian and secretary of the Robert Dover's Games Society, Francis Burns, has suggested that the wrestling scene in As You Like It \\"reflects the wrestling at the Games\\". Although Shakespeare may have been acquainted with Robert Dover, there is no evidence that he ever attended the Games.

The Games were revived for the 1951 Festival of Britain, but did not return to being a regular event until the Robert Dover's Games Society was founded in 1965. Except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of foot- and-mouth disease has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966, on the evening of the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday, and attract thousands of visitors.

After dusk a bonfire is lit, followed by a torchlight procession to the square in Chipping Campden, where the entertainment continues well into the night. The British Olympic Association, in its successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, recognised Dover's Games as \\"the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings\\". Writing in 1972, the athletics coach and sports journalist Ron Pickering said: The 2019 Games agenda included events such as a children's half mile Junior Circuit, a Championship of the Hill race for adults and a Tug O‚ÄôWar competition. The organizers also planned fireworks, a torchlit procession, marching bands and cannons firing.https://www.soglos.com/sport-outdoor/27873/Robert-Dovers- Cotswold-Olimpick-Games, Robert Dover's Cotswold Olimpick Games The web site for the 2020 Games bills itself as \\"the home of the Shin Kicking World Championships.\\"https://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/, Cotswold Olimpick Games See also *Wenlock Olympian Games References = Notes = =Citations= =Bibliography=  * * Further reading * * External links *Old shin sport alive and kicking\\" at BBC News *Videos Of Shin Kicking 2006 *Chambers' Book of Days May 31 *The Times Online: \\"A Very English Olympics\\" Category:17th-century establishments in England Category:17th century in sports Category:Athletic culture based on Greek antiquity Category:Cotswolds Category:English traditions Category:History of Gloucestershire Category:Multi-sport events in the United Kingdom Category:Recurring sporting events established before 1750 Category:1612 establishments in England ","title":"Cotswold Olimpick Games"},{"id":"2457346","text":"Horry is the surname of: *Elias Horry, intendant (mayor) of Charleston, South Carolina, United States, from 1815 to 1817 *Peter Horry (1743 or 1747-1815), American Revolutionary War militia leader and Horry County namesake *Robert Horry (born 1970), American basketball player *Thomas Stanley Horry (1898-?), English First World War flying ace *William Frederick Horry (1843-1872), English murderer ","title":"Horry"},{"id":"2457351","text":"Clouds is the second studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, released on May 1, 1969, by Reprise Records. After releasing her debut album to considerable exposure, Mitchell recorded the album at A&M; Studios in Hollywood. She produced most of the album and painted a self-portrait for its cover artwork. (The red flower is a prairie lily, the provincial flower of Saskatchewan.) Clouds has subtle, unconventional harmonies and songs about lovers, among other themes. Clouds charted at number 22 in Canada and number 31 in the United States. It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of 500,000 copies in the US. Clouds was generally well received by music critics.  Background  After moving to New York City and signing to Reprise Records in 1967, Mitchell recorded her 1968 debut album Song to a Seagull with producer David Crosby. The album was a mostly acoustic set of songs, some of which were subsequently covered by more successful singers. Consequently, Mitchell received more outside exposure and began to earn a strong cult following. Production Mitchell recorded Clouds at A&M; Studios in Hollywood and played acoustic guitar and keyboards; she was joined by Stephen Stills on guitar. She produced all of the album's songs, except \\"Tin Angel\\", which was produced by Paul A. Rothchild. She also painted the album's cover artwork‚Äîa self-portrait. Two songs, \\"Chelsea Morning\\" and \\"Both Sides, Now\\", had already been recorded by other singers by the time Mitchell started work on the album.Joni Mitchell, Biography: 1968‚Äì1970 Emerging Popular Artist , JoniMitchell.com. Mitchell wrote \\"Both Sides, Now\\" after reading Saul Bellow's 1959 novel Henderson the Rain King on a plane and drawing on a point in the novel where the protagonist is looking at clouds from a plane. The coincidence inspired the song's lyric about looking at clouds from both sides as a metaphor for life's ambiguities and mysteries, as she explained in a 1967 interview, \\"I dreamed down at the clouds, and thought that when I was a kid I had dreamed up at them, and having dreamed at the clouds from both sides as no generation of men has done, one should be able to accept his death very easily.\\" Clouds mostly features Mitchell's vocals and acoustic backing. Songs on the album feature unconventional, subtle harmonies, particularly \\"Songs to Aging Children Come\\", which employs chromatic harmonies.\\"Harmonic Palette in Early Joni Mitchell\\", p.173.

It peaked at number 22 on the RPM albums chart in Canada. In the United States, the album charted at number 31 on the Billboard 200. It won a Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance for 1969. In a contemporary review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that \\"without David Crosby's production ... Joni's voice sounds malnourished, which it is.\\" He observed three \\"excellent\\" songs‚Äî\\"Roses Blue\\", \\"Both Sides, Now\\", and \\"Chelsea Morning\\"‚Äîbut critiqued that the latter two \\"have been done better elsewhere\\", particularly Gloria Loring's cover of \\"Chelsea Morning\\". Clouds was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on August 28, 2001, having shipped 500,000 copies in the United States. In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor David Cleary called Clouds an \\"essential release\\" and \\"a stark stunner, a great leap forward for Joni Mitchell\\", commenting that her vocals \\"are more forthright and assured than on her debut and exhibit a remarkable level of subtle expressiveness.\\" Although she found Mitchell \\"a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment\\", Pitchfork Media's Jessica Hopper nonetheless viewed the album as a \\"landmark\\" for Mitchell and an \\"introduction to [her] real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit.\\" Rolling Stone observed an \\"older-and-wiser tone\\" and \\"much-improved second album\\" after Mitchell's 1968 debut. The magazine ranked the song \\"Both Sides, Now\\" number 171 on their list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. Clouds is considered a contemplative album by Rolling Stone.

A horse collar is a part of a horse harness that is used to distribute the load around a horse's neck and shoulders when pulling a wagon or plough. The collar often supports and pads a pair of curved metal or wooden pieces, called hames, to which the traces of the harness are attached. The collar allows the horse to use its full strength when pulling, essentially enabling the animal to push forward with its hindquarters into the collar. If wearing a yoke or a breastcollar, the horse had to pull with its less-powerful shoulders. The collar had another advantage over the yoke as it reduced pressure on the horse's windpipe. From the time of the invention of the horse collar, horses became more valuable for plowing and pulling. When the horse was harnessed in the collar, the horse could apply 50% more power to a task in a given time period than could an ox, due to the horse's greater speed.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 312. Additionally, horses generally have greater endurance than oxen, and thus can work more hours each day. The importance and value of horses as a resource for improving agricultural production increased accordingly. The horse collar was very important to the development of many areas of the world. Wherever oxen were used and could be replaced with horses, the use of horses boosted economies, and reduced reliance on subsistence farming. This allowed people more free time to take on specialized activities, and consequently to the development of early industry, education, and the arts in the rise of market-based towns.  Design  A horse collar is oval rather than circular and it is by design not very flexible. It is a padded appliance that conforms well to the shape of the horse's body. It is constructed so that at all points of contact with the body of the horse it avoids the air passage. By protecting the airway of the horse it became possible for the animal to use its full force to pull a load.  History  = Predecessors to the horse collar =  Earliest predecessors  Long before the horse collar harness, there was the less efficient throat-girth harness. This, it was claimed, could be found in many ancient civilizations, according to early 20th century French cavalry officer Lefebvre des No√´ttes.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 304. This type of collar was supposedly used in ancient Chaldea, both Sumeria and Assyria (1400‚Äì800 BC), ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom (1570‚Äì1070 BC), Shang Dynasty China (1600‚Äì1050 BC), Minoan Crete (2700‚Äì1450 BC), Classical Greece (550‚Äì323 BC), and ancient Rome (510 BC‚Äì476 AD).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 305‚Äì308. With this \\"ancient harness\\", ploughs and carts were pulled using harnesses that had flat straps across the neck and chest of the animal, with the load attached at the top of the collar, above the neck, in a manner similar to a yoke. These straps pressed against the horse's sterno-cephalicus muscle and trachea which restricted its breathing and reducing the pulling power of the horse. Thus, the harder a horse pulled, the more strongly it choked off its own breathing. Because of these supposed physical constraints, oxen were used in preference to horses for heavy work, as they do not have this problem due to anatomical differences and could be yoked to their loads. In 1972, Spruytte published Ancient Harness Systems which argued that there were at least three ancient traction systems shown in art, none of which choked the horses. The shoulder traction (ancient Egyptian) and breast traction (Greek and Roman) artwork had been mis-seen and mis-drawn as a composite that matched neither. This he sought to demonstrate by building reproduction chariots and harness, and running them with suitable teams. These had to be borrowed ponies as horses were too large for the surviving Egyptian chariot he used as a model. Breastcollar harness The breast-collar harness, used in China from the ancient to medieval era, c. 147 The throat-girth design was not improved until the Chinese breast-strap or \\"breastcollar\\" harness developed during the Warring States (481‚Äì221 BC) era in China.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 28. The Chinese breast harness became known throughout Central Asia by the 7th century,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 311‚Äì315. and was introduced to Europe by the 8th century. Its first depiction in artwork was on lacquer-ware boxes from the ancient State of Chu.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 310. This type of harness put pressure upon the sternum, where the line of traction is directly linked with the skeletal system of the horse, allowing for nearly full exertion.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 305. It was in universal use by the time of the Chinese Han Dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì 220 AD), depicted in artwork of hundreds of different carvings, stone reliefs, and stamped bricks showing it featured on horses pulling chariots.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 308‚Äì312. This type of breast-strap harness became known in Central Asia and elsewhere with the Avars, Magyars, Bohemians, Poles, and Russians during the 7th to 10th centuries.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 311. After Central Asia, the first breast-strap harness was spread to Europe by the 8th century (in depicted artwork), and became more widespread by the following 9th century (for example, depicted in a tapestry of the Oseberg ship burial).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 316. The problem with a breastcollar harness was that the actual shafts of the cart, chariot, or other vehicle are attached to a surcingle around the barrel of the horse. The breastplate primarily kept the surcingle from slipping back, not as the primary pushing object. This results in the horse literally pulling the load, a less efficient use of the animal.Riddle, p. 162 The modern breastcollar has traces which transfer the pull directly from the breastcollar, but a horse collar still is more effective for pulling heavy loads. = China = Earliest depiction of a horse collar, c. 477-499, Northern Wei Zhang Yichao's victory procession, showing horse collars for carriage pulling, c. 851 After the breastcollar harness, the next and final evolutionary stage was the collar harness. The collar allows a horse to use its full strength when pulling, essentially allowing the horse to push forward with its hindquarters into the collar. The fully developed collar harness was developed in Southern and Northern Dynasties China during the 5th century AD. The first questionable depiction of it in art appears on painted moulded- bricks in the Three Kingdoms (220‚Äì265 AD) era tomb of Bao Sanniang at Zhaohua, Sichuan province, China.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 324‚Äì325. These paintings display an amply padded horse collar with no sign of a yoke.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 325. However, the earliest legitimate depiction of it in art is on a Dunhuang cave mural (cave 257) from the Chinese Northern Wei Dynasty, the painting dated to 477‚Äì499 AD.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 322. In this painting the arching cross bar is clear, but the artist failed to clearly show the cushioned collar behind it, without which the whole design would have been rendered useless. The same basic design is seen in other painted Chinese frescoes, one from 520‚Äì524 AD (with shafts projecting beyond the horses chest for sternal traction), and another circa 600 AD (Sui Dynasty).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 323. This Sui Dynasty depiction (in cave 302) is of particular interest, since its depiction of the horse collar is not only more accurate (the same seen even in north and northwest China today), but it is used for a camel, not a horse.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, Plate CCXXINeedham, Volume 4, Part 2, 326. The Chinese had used camels often from the 2nd century BC onwards during the Han Dynasty, and there was even a Camel Corps serving the military on the frontier of the Tarim Basin. However, the adapted horse collar for camels would not have been common until the 6th century. In cave 156, there is a panorama painting of the Tang Dynasty Chinese general and provincial governor Zhang Yichao riding triumphantly after the recapture and conquest of the Dunhuang region from the Tibetan Empire in 834 AD.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 319‚Äì320. According to evidence provided by Dr. Chang Shuhong, the date of the painting is precisely 851 AD, yet Needham points out that there is universal consensus amongst historians that it was painted anytime between roughly 840 to 860 AD.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 320. This latter painting accurately depicts the horse collar, with a well-padded collar coming low on the chest and rising behind the cross-bar.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 321. = Europe = Earliest European depiction of a horse collar, c. 800 AD The horse collar eventually spread to Europe c. 920 AD, and became universal by the 12th century.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 317. The Scandinavians were among the first to utilize a horse collar that did not constrain the breathing passages of the horses.Chamberlain, p. 109. Prior to this development, oxen still remained the primary choice of animal for farm labor, as all the previous harnesses and collars could only be worn by them without physical penalty. Additionally, the yoke used to harness oxen were made exclusive to each individual animal. However it was sometimes difficult to cultivate the land; based upon soil condition, it may have taken up to sixteen oxen to effectively use a single heavy plow.Riddle, p. 159 This made it difficult for farmers who lacked the capital to sustain such large numbers. When the horse was harnessed with a horse collar, the horse could apply 50% more power to a task than an ox due to its greater speed.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 312. Horses generally also have greater endurance and can work more hours in a day. The centuries-long association that the Europeans had with the use of horses allowed an easier transition from oxen-based harnesses to the horse collar.Braudel, p. 345. = Impact of the horse collar = The creation of the horse collar removed the previous physical restrictions the old harness had on the animal, and allowed the horse to be able to exert its full strength in plowing. Originally, the structure of the old harness forced the horse to literally pull its workload, the horse collar‚Äôs development instead allowed the horse to push its workload, increasing the efficiency of its labor output. Following the introduction of the horse collar to Europe and its use being clearly evident by 1000 AD,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 327. the use of horses for ploughing became more widespread. Horses work roughly 50 percent faster than oxen. With the collar, combined with the horseshoe, the heavy plow, and other developments in the agricultural system, the efficiency of the European peasant farmer in producing food increased, allowing further societal development in Europe.Wigelsworth, p. 10. The surplus in food allowed labor specialization as farmers could change their occupation and focus on other skills, such as the purchase and selling of goods, resulting in the emergence of a merchant class within European society. The horse collar was one of the factors in the ending of the feudal system and transition from the Middle Ages.Bolich, p. 55.  Weight pulling studies  Horses in highly decorative harness with horse collars. The French cavalry officer Lefebvre des No√´ttes experimented with the ancient throat-and-girth harness in comparison the later trace breast-harness and then finally the matured form of the medieval collar harness. In his experiment of 1910, he found that two horses (aided by effective traction) using the throat-and-girth harness were limited to pulling about 1100 lbs. ( ton). However, a single horse with a more efficient collar harness could draw a weight of about tons. However, the findings of Lefebvre des No√´ttes were not without challenges, notably the argument that there was an early partial horse collar, a dorsal yoke system, dating to ancient Rome, and that Lefebvre's designs did not accurately reflect those actually used, but rather created an inaccurate design that was less efficient than any actual ancient harnesses used.Weller, J. A. \\"Roman Traction Systems\\" While Lefebvre's experiments clearly demonstrated that the throat and girth design he used rode up on horses and cut off their air, images from ancient art and partial yokes found by archaeologists suggested that with proper placement and the addition of a stiff partial yoke, the breastcollar remained on the chest, and wind was not in fact cut off while pulling.Weller, J. A. \\"Roman Traction Systems ‚Äì The Dorsal Yoke\\"Weller, J. A. \\"A History of Collar Harnessing in Source-Pictures\\" Further studies conducted in 1977 by Spruytte and Littauer, followed up by Georges Raepsaet, with more accurately reconstructed ancient designs suggested that horses with ancient harness designs could pull nearly as much as with the more modern horse collar.Weller, J. A. \\"Roman Traction Systems ‚Äì Load Limits\\" The primary benefit to the use of the modern horse collar, it is argued, was that it allowed a lower point of attachment and in so doing increased the usability of horses for ploughing.Weller, J.

The remainder of the Pledge, which does not appear in the photograph, is \\"... so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation\\". The Singapore National Pledge is an oath of allegiance to the flag of Singapore and the Republic of Singapore. It is commonly recited by Singaporeans in unison at public events, especially in schools, in the Singapore Armed Forces and during the National Day Parade. In October 1965, William Cheng, Principal Assistant Secretary of Administration of the Ministry of Education, mooted the idea of a pledge to inculcate national consciousness and patriotism in schools. The idea gained the support of then Minister for Education, Ong Pang Boon, who gave the task of drafting the pledge to Philip Liau, Advisor on Textbooks and Syllabuses, and George Thomson, Director of the Political Study Centre. Ong sent the two drafts to S. Rajaratnam, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, for his comments. After that, the draft underwent another round of revisions by Ministry officials as well as then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew before submission to the Cabinet for final approval. From August 1966 onwards, students began reciting the National Pledge before the start of each school day. As not many schools then had open areas for morning assemblies, the Pledge was initially recited mainly in classrooms. Since then, the National Pledge has been recited during National Day occasions, the National Day Parade and school assemblies. The original English text was also translated into Chinese, Malay and Tamil. According to S. Rajaratnam, the Pledge emerged against the backdrop of a vital struggle to forge a sense of nationhood and build ‚Äúa Singapore we are proud of‚Äù. He believed that language, race and religion were potentially divisive factors and used the Pledge to emphasise that these differences could be overcome if Singaporeans were united in their commitment to the country.  The Pledge  The National Pledge is: ;English version ‚ÄúWe, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion, to build a democratic society based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.\\" An earlier version was suggested by Minister of Culture (later Deputy Prime Minister) S. Rajaratnam in a letter to Ong Pang Boon, the Minister for Education in a letter dated 18 February 1966. It reads: ‚ÄúWe, as citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves to forget differences of race, language or religion and become one united people; to build a democratic society where justice and equality will prevail and where we will seek happiness and progress by helping one another.‚Äùhttp://theindependent.sg/k-shanmugam- shares-old-letter-between-s-rajaratnam-and-ong-pang-boon-with-origins-of- singapore-pledge/ ;Malay version Kami, warga negara Singapura, sebagai rakyat yang bersatu padu, tidak kira apa bangsa, bahasa, atau agama, berikrar untuk membina suatu masyarakat yang demokratik, berdasarkan kepada keadilan dan persamaan untuk mencapai kebahagian, kemakmuran dan kemajuan bagi negara kami. ;Chinese version { !

It forms the head of the East Rongbuk Glacier. When climbers attempt to climb Everest via the North ridge (Tibet), the first camp on the mountain itself (traditional Camp IV, modern Camp I) is established on the North Col. From this point at approximately above sea level, climbers ascend the North Ridge to reach a series of progressively higher camps along the North Face of Everest. Climbers make their final push to the summit from Camp VI at 8,230 metres (27,001 ft) altitude. The North Col was first climbed by George Mallory, Edward Oliver Wheeler, and Guy Bullock on 23 September 1921, during the British reconnaissance expedition. This was the first time a Westerner had set foot on Mount Everest. Although long credited to Mallory, discovery of the North Col was in fact made by Wheeler about a week before Mallory confirmed its existence while searching for possible routes to the summit of Mount Everest. All subsequent expeditions in the 1920s and 1930s attempted to reach the summit of Everest by using the North Col. Before 1950, most Everest expeditions went from Tibet and via the North Col, but most now go from Nepal via the South Col. In 1951, two mountaineers on the 1952 British Cho Oyu expedition, Edmund Hillary and George Lowe, crossed the Nup La Col, and \\"like a couple of naughty schoolboys\\" went deep into Chinese territory, down to Rongbuk and round to the old prewar Camp III beneath the North Col.George Lowe and Huw Lewis-Jones, The Conquest of Everest: Original Photographs from the Legendary First Ascent (London: Thames and Hudson, 2013) (pages 23,212) 250px Overview This map is inverted; south is up and north is down.

It is used for various purposes, including upholstery, brushes, the bows of musical instruments, a hard-wearing fabric called haircloth, and for horsehair plaster, a wallcovering material formerly used in the construction industry and now found only in older buildings. Horsehair can be very stiff or very fine and flexible; mane hair is generally softer and shorter than tail hair. The texture of horsehair can be influenced by the breed and management of the horse, including natural conditions such as diet or climate. Processing may also affect quality and feel. Horsehair is a protein fiber that absorbs water slowly, but can be dyed or colored effectively using traditional dyes suitable for protein fibers. It can be felted, but not easily. Fr√∂berg, Kerstin. \\"Horsehair as a Textile.\\" 1998. Accessed December 8, 2010. Uses Mane hair is shorter and softer than tail hair. Horsehair fabrics are woven with wefts of tail hair from live horses and cotton or silk warps. Horsehair fabrics are sought for their lustre, durability and care properties and mainly used for upholstery and interiors.Horsehair fabrics woven by John Boyd Textiles Horsehair is used for the crafts of horsehair hitching, horsehair braiding, pottery, and in making jewelry items such as bracelets, necklaces, earrings and barrettes. http://Horsehair-Jewelry&id;=226245 It is used to make some wall and fine arts paintbrushes. Painting is one of the areas where horsehair is still widely used today. The horsehair is processed, cut to size and fitted to paint brushes that are used for anything from painting walls to painting pictures to be hung in galleries. Horsehair is desirable for paint brushes because of its smooth lay and ability to hold a large amount of paint acting as a reservoir and allowing the painter to stop less frequently.Martha Stewart Living Oct2008, Issue 179, p51-52 Horsehair is used for violin and other stringed instrument bows. Another use in the art community comes from pottery and basket weaving where the hair is used for distinct accents and styling.Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies , Vol. 31, No. 1, Objects of Desire: Victorian Art at the Art Institute of Chicago pp. 68-88+94-96 The use of horsehair for fishing has a wide range of applications. The most widely applied use for horsehair is in the fishing line. The hair is spun together and made into very long lines.Johnson, Victor R.

Hair for bows comes from tails of horses in cold climates, and is sorted by size. It comes primarily from stallions and costs $150‚Äì$400 per pound because of the sorting needed to extract long hairs. Mongolia produces 900 tons of horsehair per year. History Louis Bonaparte wearing a dragoon helmet with mane There has been some speculation as to the first use of horsehair. Many sources indicate the Spaniards in the 8th century were the first to use horsehair as a textile.Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition 7/1/2010, p1-2 However, the first documented use was from the 9th century in Switzerland where the Swiss used it for the plans of St. Gall Abbey. The plans, a blueprint for a monastic compound in medieval times, are a national preserved treasure to the Swiss that were said to have been woven with horsehair.Birmingham, David.

Print It was commonly used in the 19th century as upholstery stuffing (such as for fabric sofasChesterfield Sofas ‚Äì A History Lesson - January 2010) and as covering fabric for furniture. It was almost always the fiber used to make shaving brushes. It was also common in hats and women's undergarments. It was used in the hair to create the \\"Gibson Girl\\" look, and in the 18th century it was used in wigs. Until the 20th century, it was commonly used to make fine arts paintbrushes, along with sable, fox, wolf, goat, and lamb hair. Calligraphy brushes are made from rabbit, fox, or horse hair, among others. For thousands of years, fishing lines were made of plaited horsehair. Other applications In modern times, mane and tail horsehair samples with root tissue attached are commonly used for DNA analysis of equine specimens.

It is more commonly known to the university's students as Kul√™ (). It is known for its radical, national democratic, often anti-administration views, and gives critical views on the policies of the UP administration and the Philippine government. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the Collegian has suspended its print operations, and has fully migrated to its online and other digital platforms. History First known as the College Folio (1910) and Varsity News (1917). As the College Folio, it was one of the first undergraduate journals in the Philippines. The Philippine Collegian was officially established in 1922. Since then, it has become a symbol for academic freedom, critical thinking, and journalistic integrity and excellence. In 1935, the Collegian published Teodoro Agoncillo's review of Ricardo Pascual's book Dr. Jose Rizal beyond the Grave, despite threats of excommunication from the Catholic Church. And in 1951, editor in chief (EIC) Elmer Ordo√±ez exposed the government's intervention in UP affairs, particularly in the aftermath of UP President Bienvenido Gonzalez's resignation. That period also saw the accommodation of the Filipino language in its content. During the post-war years, the Collegian became increasingly progressive in tackling university-based issues, particularly on ‚Äúsecretarianism‚Äù and favoritism in the administration. Despite the widespread conservatism, which equated nationalist sentiments with ‚Äúcommunist threats,‚Äù the Collegian continued publishing articles from socialism to the Hukbalahap movement. During the Japanese Occupation, the Collegian was largely silent, since many of the university's units were shut down. In 1946, the Collegian resumed publishing, maintaining an anti- colonialist perspective. The 1950s brought to fore issues of academic freedom in the University, heightening the clash of beliefs between the Collegian, the University administration, and the national government. Then EIC Homobono Adaza, for example, was expelled for an editorial criticizing the UP administration. Articles on the emergent revolutionary movement gained ground in the 1960s, complementing the rise of the student movement against the dictatorship of then President Ferdinand Marcos. During Martial Law, the Collegian defied the media blackout by going underground. The publication formed the radical press together with the other student publications such as the Ang Malaya of the Philippine College of Commerce, now Polytechnic University of the Philippines and Pandayan of Ateneo de Manila University and the publications of various national democratic groups. By the time Martial Law as declared in 1972, the Collegian's nationalist orientation was already established. The publication continued to operate underground, exposing realities that were vastly different from what was presented by government- controlled media. Subsequently, several Collegian staff, including Enrique Voltaire Garcia and Antonio Tagamolila, faced imprisonment and death. While the regular Collegian headed by EIC Oscar Yabes in 1973 headlined UP President Salvador P. Lopez's campus beautification project and weekly UAAP updates, the Rebel Collegian decried the 20-percent tuition hike and the dissolution of student institutions like the Office of Student Regent and the UP Student Council. The Rebel Collegian issues brought to the fore the students' demand for lower tuition and dorm rates, among others, while \\"taking up the oppressed masses cause in exposing the corruption, servility, and violence of our semi- colonial and semi-feudal society.\\" Meanwhile, the regular Collegian of then EIC Oscar Yabes served as a diversionary propaganda tool with its emphasis on counter-revolutionary literary pieces, with nary a critique of the atrocities under the US-Marcos regime. Yabes would also later come under fire due to his alleged malversation of the newspaper's funds. The paper remained vigilant even after the collapse of the Marcos regime. In the 1989 editorial ‚ÄúEDSA and UP--Three Years After,‚Äù EIC Ruben Carranza, Jr. noted that ‚Äúsocial injustice and foreign domination‚Äù remained entrenched in Philippine society. In the euphoria following the end of People Power, this viewpoint was decidedly unpopular. The conflicts experienced by the Collegian, however, were not entirely external. Power struggles and challenges in editorship roused many controversies in the past. For instance, the Rebel Collegian came into existence in 1996 after the epic battle between Voltaire Veneracion and Richard Gappi, rivals for the EIC post that year. The UP community saw two contending Collegians--Gappi's Rebel Collegian and the regular Collegian under Veneracion. The articles in the Rebel Collegian in 1996 bore no byline, although it was an open secret that Gappi led the publication's operations. The newsprint became an arena of the opposing camps from the ideological rift that characterized the Left movement then. On the one hand, Veneracion and the editor before him, Ibarra Gutierrez, espoused social democratic politics, Gappi and most of his colleagues from former EIC Michael John Ac-Ac's staff embraced national democracy. Unfailingly and unapologetically, the Rebel Collegian of the nineties expressed stances that may be deemed \\"hardline\\" and carried on the nationalist struggle, which the then regular Collegian abdicated. The ‚Äò90s spurred additional internal disputes as staffers and editors fought to assert competing philosophies. For instance, EIC Herbert Docena's pluralism, which sought to accommodate all ideologies without making a stand, was pitched against advocacy journalism, which entailed the formulation of a clear stance on the issues. At the height of the campaign against the 300 percent tuition hike, then UP President Emerlinda Roman insisted on a public bidding for the Collegian's printing press, based on a flimsy interpretation of Republic Act 9184 or the Government Procurement Act, and thus withheld funds for four months‚Äîthe publication's longest hiatus yet since World War II. This crisis compelled then EIC Karl Castro's staff to unleash Rebel Kul√™, to continue to rally the students against Roman's skewed policies. Unlike the prior Rebel Collegians, Castro's was the first to wage mutiny against the UP administration aboveground and from within the institution whose authority it seeks to subvert. Since the ouster of Marcos during the EDSA Revolution, the Collegian has regularly undergone changes in format, withstood controversies regarding the selection of its editors, and remained a critical voice as part of the alternative media.

Wyeth Chandler (February 21, 1930 ‚Äì November 11, 2004) served as mayor of Memphis, Tennessee from 1972 to 1982. He was the adopted son of former Memphis mayor and U.S. Representative Walter Chandler. Chandler succeeded the controversial Henry Loeb, who battled local sanitation workers during a strike that brought Martin Luther King, Jr. to Memphis in April 1968. This violence- ridden episode in the city's history resulted in King's death by assassin James Earl Ray on April 4. Chandler spent much of his tenure dealing with the economic and social fallout from the strike and the killing, as the incidents gave the city a bad name among business and charitable interests for some years. Chandler was mayor at the time of Elvis Presley's death in 1977, and during the police and firemen's strike the following year. Some Memphians criticized his administration as too \\"status quo\\", but he was undeniably popular, winning three consecutive elections. After resigning from office to accept a judgeship appointment from the Governor of Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, Chandler was succeeded by two interim mayors: first by J.O. Patterson, Jr. (the first-ever African-American to serve in the office), then by Wallace Madewell. The next regularly elected mayor was Richard Hackett, who served from 1983 to 1991.

He started his career with West Ham United and has also played for Grays Athletic, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Coventry City. He has played eleven times in his international career for Wales. Club career =West Ham United= Eastwood began his career as a West Ham United Academy player after turning down a scholarship offer at Southend where he had been a promising youth player. At West Ham, Eastwood played in the same youth team as Jermain Defoe, Anton Ferdinand, and Glen Johnson but was not considered good enough by then-manager Glenn Roeder and was released by the Hammers in May 2003. After being released, he considered quitting football altogether and worked briefly as a car salesman. =Grays Athletic= Eastwood joined Conference South side Grays Athletic in August 2003 He scored 37 league and cup goals in his first season, winning the Grays' Golden Boot and prompting attention from a number of professional clubs including Northampton Town, Swindon Town and Charlton Athletic as well as Southend United. =Southend United= Eastwood joined Southend United in October 2004, initially on loan. He made his debut for the club in spectacular style, scoring the opener after 7.7 seconds, an English league record for a debut, and going on to score two more to record his first of three hat-tricks for the club as Southend beat top of the table Swansea City 4‚Äì2. Eastwood joined Southend on a permanent basis in November 2004 for an undisclosed fee in a three-year deal from Grays. He finished the 2004‚Äì05 season with 24 goals from 42 appearances in all competitions and scored the opening goal in his club's 2‚Äì0 win over Lincoln City in the League Two Play- off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in May 2005 that resulted in promotion for Southend United. Eastwood scored Southend United's 5,000th League goal on 2 January 2006 when he smashed home the late winner against Blackpool at Bloomfield Road as the Shrimpers went to the top of League One. He scored twice at Swansea City on 29 April 2006 to earn Southend United a 2‚Äì2 draw, a result which sealed promotion to the Football League Championship. By the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, Eastwood was joint 18th in Southend's all-time leading goalscorers list with 49 goals, 45 of which were in the league, two in the FA Cup and two in the Football League Trophy. He was also joint top scorer with Billy Sharp in League One in 2005‚Äì06 with 23 goals. The following season, Eastwood scored his 50th goal for the club in the Championship opener game against Stoke City. It would prove to be a difficult season for the striker and despite scoring 11 goal in the Championship, Eastwood was unable to prevent relegation back to League One, however the highlight of the Shrimpers season came when Eastwood scored the only goal, a spectacular 30-yard free kick in front of the away fans in the North Stand, during the Football League Cup fourth round win against Manchester United on 7 November 2006 to put the holders out of the competition. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= Eastwood signed a four-year deal with Wolves in July 2007 after completing a ¬£1.5m move from Southend. The striker started the 2007‚Äì08 season impressively, scoring his first goal for Wolves on his full debut in the League Cup first round win over Bradford City, and finishing the month with 4 goals to his name. This prolific start earned him the Championship Player of the Month Award for August. However, his goals dried up in the following months and he was often on the substitutes' bench or left out of the squad completely, with Andy Keogh, Jay Bothroyd, Kevin Kyle and Sylvan Ebanks-Blake now ahead of him in the pecking order. He was close to a move away from Molineux to Coventry City in March 2008, but this collapsed at the last minute. He remained popular with many Wolves fans, who believed he had not been given a fair run of games, which caused a split between the fans towards the end of the season. He finished the campaign with just 3 goals in 10 league starts (35 appearances in total), prompting him to leave the club, with manager Mick McCarthy explaining, \\"It's nothing personal, but it hasn't worked out how either of us would have liked. He hasn't fitted into my team but he wants to play and will do well elsewhere. We wish him luck.\\" =Coventry City= In July 2008, he joined fellow Championship club Coventry City in a four-year deal for a reported ¬£1.2million fee. Eastwood made his Coventry City debut against Norwich City on 9 August 2008, Coventry won the game 2‚Äì0. Eastwood scored his first goal for the Sky Blues a week later against Barnsley in a 2‚Äì1 win for Coventry. Goals against Blackpool, Ipswich Town and Watford followed but it was to be another frustrating season in front of goal for the striker who towards the latter stage of the campaign was used in a left midfield role. On 31 October 2009 he scored a hat-trick against Peterborough where the game finished 3‚Äì2. He was the first player to score a hat-trick at the Ricoh Arena. Eastwood was released by Coventry City when his contract ran out at the end of the 2011/2012 season. =Return to Southend= Great Wakering Rovers in 2013. On 22 March 2012, Eastwood returned on loan to his former club Southend United until the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. He made his second Southend debut on 24 March 2012 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Ground. He scored his first Southend United goal since his return in his second appearance in Southend 4‚Äì0 win against Cheltenham Town on 30 March 2012. At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season Eastwood underwent surgery on a troublesome knee problem. On 12 July 2012, Eastwood signed a two-year contract to stay at Southend, following his release from relegated Coventry City. On 22 September 2012, Eastwood scored his first goal since his permanent return to Southend when he headed in from close range to score the winner in a 2‚Äì1 triumph over Exeter City. Eastwood returned for the start of pre-season training ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season, looking thinner and sharper and started the season in his best form since 2005 after scoring 4 goals in consecutive games and claimed he was feeling as confident now as he was in his first spell with the club. Manager Phil Brown, claimed Eastwood was in the form of his career. Eastwood spent much of the 2013-2014 season as a squad player, playing in 30 League games, 19 as substitute. On 23 May 2014, Southend announced that Eastwood's contract was not to be renewed bringing an end to an association with Southend that brought 77 goals over two spells. The club in a statement said that Eastwood was a 'Southend legend'. International career As his paternal grandmother was born in Wales, Eastwood is eligible to play for Wales. He was selected for the squad for the international friendly against New Zealand in May 2007 and the crucial Euro 2008 qualifier against Czech Republic in June, however an existing back injury did not heal as quickly as hoped and Eastwood was forced to withdraw from the squad. He was selected for the squad to play Bulgaria and went on to score his debut international goal in the first half of their 1‚Äì0 victory on 22 August 2007. John Toshack, the Wales manager, said, \\"It was a really special goal [...] Now we have got a player up front who knows his business. We have been aware of his goalscoring exploits and have worked hard to make sure he became a Wales international.\\" Despite being out of favour at Wolves during the 2007‚Äì08 season, Eastwood continued to be selected for the Welsh national team and scored both goals in a 2‚Äì0 win over Luxembourg in March 2008. He has scored four goals in ten international appearances. His final appearance for Wales came in February 2011 in Wales' Nations Cup match with Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Personal life Eastwood was born to a Romanichal family in Epsom, Surrey and was often seen exercising his horse on the A127 road in Essex on the morning of a match day when playing for Southend United. He appealed to the British Government in August 2006 to keep his home on a travellers' site in Basildon after Basildon Council refused planning permission. Eastwood and his family were told in November 2006 that the decision of Basildon Council would not be upheld by the Government and he was free to stay there for at least the next five years. Eastwood was fined by magistrates in July 2009, after he had been caught fly-tipping rubbish which included an electricity bill and bank statements containing his name. Eastwood's son, also named Freddy, currently plays in Southend United's youth academy.

Recorded in the months before his death, it would be Mingus's final musical project; the album is wholly dedicated to him. Mingus was released on June 13, 1979. The album is quite experimental, featuring minimalist jazz, over-plucked, buzzing acoustic guitars, and even wolves howling through \\"The Wolf That Lives in Lindsey\\". All of the lyrics are by Mitchell, while the music for four of the songs was composed by Mingus, three being new tunes, a fourth being his tribute to saxophonist Lester Young from his 1959 classic Mingus Ah Um, \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\", for which Mitchell wrote a set of lyrics. As with the release preceding, Don Juan's Reckless Daughter, Mitchell hired personnel from jazz fusion group Weather Report, notably bassist Jaco Pastorius to play on the sessions. Mingus would also mark the first reunion of saxophonist Wayne Shorter and pianist Herbie Hancock in the studio since recording together on Shorter's seminal Native Dancer album, featuring Milton Nascimento, released in September 1974. The album is spliced with excerpts, which are labelled \\"(Rap)\\", from recordings provided by Sue Graham Mingus, including a scat singing interplay between Joni and Mingus, and Charles and Sue arguing over his age at a birthday party. In \\"Funeral\\", Mingus and others discuss how long he'll live and what his funeral will be like. He refers to the Vedanta Society and asserts that he's going to live longer than Duke Ellington, who died in 1974, aged 75, by saying, \\"I'm going to cut Duke!\\". \\"God Must Be a Boogie Man\\"‚Äîhaving taken shape two days after his death‚Äîwas the only song Mingus was unable to hear. Mitchell suggests in the liner notes that Mingus would have found it hilarious. The song was re-recorded with orchestral accompaniment on Joni's 2002 album \\"Travelogue\\". The artwork features several paintings by Mitchell of Mingus. It peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. Track listing Personnel Sources: =Musicians= Prior to recording the album, Mitchell had several \\"experimental sessions\\" with New York musicians who had worked with Mingus.

He was one of the most important persons of the Estonian national awakening in the second half of the 19th century. Political activity Between 1860 and 1880, the Governorate of Livonia was led by a moderate nobility-dominated government. Jakobson became the leader of the radical wing, advocating widespread reforms in Livonia. He was responsible for the economic-political program of the Estonian national movement. Jakobson urged Estonians to demand equal political rights with the region's Germans and an end to privileged position of the Baltic-German nobility. In 1878, Jakobson established the Estonian newspaper Sakala. The paper quickly became a vital promoter of the cultural awakening. He also had a central role in the establishment of the Society of Estonian Literati, which was an influential Estonian association in the second half of the 19th century. Legacy =Museum= The Carl Robert Jakobson Museum in Kurgja In 1948, the Museum of Carl Robert Jakobson was established by Jakobson's oldest daughter, Linda, in their family estate in Kurgja.

History King's Mill was built in 1879 for Friend Martin at a cost of ¬£2,500 by Messrs Grist and Steele, the Horsham millwrights. Machinery from a windmill at Coldwaltham is believed to have been incorporated in the mill. Martin operated the mill and the village shop until he died in 1884. The Mill failed to sell so his wife hired Robert Miller as Miller on her behalf. In 1895 it was sold to Richard Vincent who hired Ernest Powell to be the Miller. The writer Hilaire Belloc bought the mill and the surrounding land in 1906. Powell continued to be Miller while the mill worked commercially until 1926, latterly by a steam engine. It was bought in 1906 by Hilaire Belloc, who owned it until his death in 1953. King's Mill was restored by E Hole and Sons, the Burgess Hill millwrights, as a memorial to Belloc soon after his death and was re-opened to visitors for the first time in 1958. West Sussex County Council had the responsibility for the upkeep of the mill, which remained in the ownership of the Belloc family. A local committee the Friends of Shipley Windmill opened the mill to visitors until 1986. Major repairs to the mill were required and County Council agreed with the owners to form a charitable trust to manage the mill. The Shipley Windmill Charitable Trust was formed in 1987 and took over responsibility for the maintenance. Further restoration work was carried out by Hole's between 1987 and 1990, when the mill re-opened, although with only two sweeps at that time. The second pair of sweeps was fitted in 1991. A new pair of sweeps and a new stock were fitted in November 2004. On 7 April 2009, it was announced that the mill was to close to the public as the lease owned by Shipley Mill Charitable Trust only had three years to run and they had been notified that the lease would not be renewed when it expired. The mill opened for the 2009 season on 5 April and held its last open day on 19 July. Description King's Mill is a four-storey smock mill on a two-storey brick base. It has four Patent Sails carried on a cast- iron windshaft. The octagonal conical cap is winded by a fantail. The Brake Wheel is wood, driving a cast-iron Wallower on an oak Upright Shaft. This carries a cast-iron Great Spur Wheel which drives three pairs of overdrift millstones. The mill is Grade II* listed.

He was a 5th-century BC contemporary of Gautama Buddha and Jain Tirthankara Lord Mahavira. His system of government appears to have been a committee which elected a ceremonial king to act upon the committee's advice. His daughter Trishala was married to Siddhartha and gave birth to the 24th Tirthankara Mahavira, another daughter Chellana married Bimbisara. Chetaka had 10 sons Dhandutt, Dhanprabh, Upendra, Sudutt, Sidutt, Sukumbojh, Akampan, Patangak, Prabhanjan, Prabhas.  Jain tradition  According to Jain text UttarapurƒÅ·πáa, Chetaka was the king of Vaishali and was a famous and complaisant king. He is mentioned as a staunch follower of Jainism. According to the text, Chetaka had ten sons and seven daughters. His sister Priyakarini (also known as Trishala) was married to Siddartha. His daughter Chellana married Shrenik (also known as Bimbisara). Death of King Chetak: When King Kaunik aka Ajatshatru attacked Vaishali King Chetak being righteous fought against him, his maternal grandson. King Chetak being a true Jain Shravak used to shoot only one kowtow which was divine n would kill the commander of Kaunik every day for 10 days. Ajatshatru prayed to Gods to have a solution to this. Dev's granted him a way to deflect the arrow killing power. When king Chetak saw that his di Ind arrow became useless he climbed a mountain to commit suicide but was protected by Dharnendra Indra and he preached and counselled him. Then he took King Chetak to Devaloka and upon seeing his last time; avowed him to Santhara and thereupon king Chetak the only Shravak to die in Devaloka and born there as Deva.

The older term, shire is historically equivalent to county. By the Middle Ages, county had become established as the unit of local government, at least in England.Bryne, T., Local Government in Britain, (1994) By the early 17th century, all of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland had been separated into counties. In Scotland shire was the only term used until after the Act of Union 1707. Since the early 19th century, counties have been adapted to meet new administrative and political requirements, and the word county (often with a qualifier) has been used in different senses for different purposes. In some areas of England and Wales, counties still perform the functions of modern local government. In other parts of the United Kingdom, especially within large metropolitan areas, they have been replaced with alternative unitary authorities, which are considered 'county level' authorities.Jones, B. et al., Politics UK, (2004) Today, these have largely replaced the historic county corporate entities granted self-governance with county government powers. Today, in addition to local government counties, every part of the United Kingdom lies within the historic counties which have formed geographic and cultural units since the Middle Ages.\\"United Kingdom\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Accessed 9 June 2014. England England is divided into 48 ceremonial counties, which are also known as geographic counties. Many of these counties have their basis in the 39 historic counties whose origins lie in antiquity, although some were established as recently as 1974. Outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly, England is also divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. These correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government and may consist of a single district or be divided into several. As of April 2009, 27 such counties are divided into districts and have a county council. Most ceremonial counties correspond to a metropolitan or non-metropolitan county of the same name, but often with reduced boundaries. The current arrangement is the result of incremental reform; from 1974 to 1996 the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties corresponded directly with the ceremonial counties. From 1889 to 1974 areas with county councils were known as administrative counties and ceremonial counties were defined separately. Scotland Scottish counties in 1975 In Scotland, there are 33 local government counties, created under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. They were abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, in favour of regions and districts and islands council areas. The regions and districts were themselves abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994,OPSI - Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 in favour of unitary Scottish council areas. (The islands areas had been created as unitary council areas, and their boundaries were unaffected.) The 1889 legislation created county councils, turned each civil county (with one exception) into a contiguous area and adjusted boundaries where civil parishes straddled county boundaries, or had fragments in more than one county. The counties of Ross and Cromarty were merged to form Ross and Cromarty.Boundaries of Counties and Parishes in Scotland, Hay Shennan, 1892 One region and various districts, created in 1975, had areas similar to those of earlier counties, and various council areas, created in 1996, are also similar. Two of the three islands areas‚ÄîOrkney and Shetland‚Äîhave boundaries identical to those of earlier counties. Scotland has also registration counties, which are in current use. The areas of Scotland that are appointed a Lord-Lieutenant are called lieutenancy areas. Wales Historic counties of Wales The thirteen historic counties of Wales were fixed by statute in 1535 (although counties such as Pembrokeshire date from 1138). The Administrative Counties of Wales created in 1889 were based on these. In 1974 a new system was created using vastly different entities. These were abolished in 1996 and since then Wales has been entirely divided into a system of unitary authorities (also known as principal areas). Eleven of the 22 unitary authorities are legally \\"counties\\", and eleven are county boroughs, although informally all are referred to as \\"counties\\". The areas of Wales that are appointed a Lord-Lieutenant are the preserved counties of Wales; which are combinations of principal areas chosen to approximate the counties constituted in 1974. Northern Ireland Counties of Northern Ireland There are six counties in Northern Ireland. In order of landmass these are; Tyrone, Antrim, Down, Londonderry, Fermanagh and Armagh. The six historic counties of Northern Ireland are no longer in use for administrative purposes. Combined with the boroughs of Belfast and Derry, the counties do serve for organisational purposes within government, and often with private businesses and sporting clubs. The counties of Northern Ireland are all within the historic province of Ulster, which includes an additional three other counties in the Republic of Ireland: Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.

It is the second oldest paper in the city after El Universal, printing its first issue on March 18, 1917. History Exc√©lsior was founded by Rafael Alducin and first published in Mexico City on March 18, 1917. In 1924, Alducin died at the age of 35, and his family led the newspaper into difficult times. Ultimately, it was reconstituted as a worker-owned cooperative in 1932, with one-time accountant Gilberto Figueroa named general manager. His ability to manage finances and broker compromise within the newspaper contributed to a successful 30-year reign, in which the newspaper would become politically and economically stable. Beginning in 1968, the newspaper's editorial stance was of a relatively liberal bent, under the editorship of Julio Scherer Garc√≠a. After Scherer left the newspaper in 1976, the editorial stance became more overtly supportive of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the Mexican establishment in general, in a move spurred when President Luis Echeverr√≠a secretly incited a group of workers to take over the cooperative and install new leadership. The \\"Exc√©lsior coup\\" instituted the new leadership that would be at the head of Exc√©lsior until 2001. The outgoing editorial staff went on to found new publications, like Proceso, Vuelta and Unom√°suno. In 2001, Regino D√≠az Redondo, who had led the paper since 1976, was ousted, leaving in his wake a disorganized cooperative and an indebted newspaper. The end of the PRI's hold on Mexican politics brought with it a falling out of favor for the publication. In January 2006, the newspaper was sold to Grupo Imagen, the owners of radio and TV interests in Mexico City, headed by Olegario V√°zquez Ra√±a. The cooperative voted 591‚Äì7 to authorize the sale of Exc√©lsior. The sale led to the dissolution of the cooperative and the relaunch of the newspaper on March 18, 2006. Its main writers also contribute to Imagen radio and Cadena Tres; Exc√©lsior TV, a cable news channel also available over the air in Mexico City, launched in September 2013.

Franchises exist on the Las Vegas Strip and on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California. It is also a popular brand of tequila. All were founded by rock musician Sammy Hagar. Cantina Hagar performing at the Cabo Wabo Hagar, already a successful rock musician, first visited the Mexican town of Cabo San Lucas in the early 1980s, before joining Van Halen in July 1985 after the departure of their founding singer, David Lee Roth. Seeking a place for himself and his friends to relax and play music, he and his long time friend, Marco Monroy, partnered up and opened a large bar, restaurant, and performance space. Launched in April 1990, the cantina was initially a financial failure, leading Hagar to buy out his bandmates. Under new management, the bar became popular with both locals and tourists as the town quickly grew into a major resort. In 2004, after plans fell through to open in Las Vegas, Hagar opened a second location in the basement of the historic Harvey's casino on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. However, that location has since closed. A third location was opened in Fresno, California in 2008, but had its license pulled by Hagar at the beginning of 2009. Cabo Wabo Las Vegas opened in The Miracle Mile shopping center at Planet Hollywood in November 2009. The club typically attracts an older adult clientele with its mostly rock music selection. Hagar claims he coined the name after watching a man walk unsteadily along a local beach after a heavy night's partying. Using the town's nickname, Cabo (which means \\"cape\\" in Spanish), and shortening \\"wobble\\" to \\"wabo\\" he said of the man that he was doing the \\"Cabo wabo.\\" Hagar later used the phrase in his lyrics and title for the Van Halen song. In 1990 he hired Noel Vestri, an innovator in computer graphic designs (including work on Vans Tennis Shoes) to design a logo for the brand, which is still used today. Tequila Patrons drinking in a portion of the cantina In the late 1990s, Hagar began selling his patrons a house brand of hand-made tequila he commissioned from a family-owned distillery in the state of Jalisco. In 1999, a wine importer from Napa Valley began to import the tequila into the United States. An instant success, sales rose from 37,000 cases the first year to 140,000 cases in 2006, making it the second-best selling premium tequila in the United States. Several of the Cabo Wabo offerings have performed quite well at international spirit ratings competitions. The a√±ejo offering received three silver, one gold and one double gold medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2008 and 2012. Its reposado tequila received a score of 92 from the 2008 Beverage Testing Institute. The blanco tequila received a gold medal at the 2020 New York International Spirits Competition. In May 2007 it was announced that Hagar would sell an 80% interest in Cabo Wabo Tequila to Gruppo Campari, the world's sixth-largest spirits company, for $80 million. Skyy Spirits of San Francisco, a vodka producer and subsidiary of Gruppo Campari, planned to market Cabo Wabo globally, with continued participation by Hagar. Gerry Ruvo, president and chief executive of Skyy Spirits, said, \\"Sammy has done a fantastic job building the brand, so we are going to obviously spend time with him and work with him to continue our efforts to take the brand to an even larger level, both here in the US and, more important, globally.\\" Ruvo said Great Britain, Spain, Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan, Germany and Italy are considered key expansion markets for tequila.

First conceptualised in 1987 by the late Lee Kuan Yew, the Barrage started construction on 22 March 2005, and was officially opened on 31 October 2008 as Singapore's fifteenth reservoir. It provides water storage, flood control and recreation. It won a Superior Achievement Award from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers in 2009. Purpose The S$3 billion project turns Marina Bay and Kallang Basin into a new downtown freshwater Marina Reservoir. It provides water supply, flood control and a new lifestyle attraction. By keeping out seawater, the barrage forms Singapore's 15th reservoir and first reservoir in the city. Marina Reservoir, together with the future Punggol and Serangoon reservoirs, will increase Singapore's water catchment areas by one- sixth of Singapore's total land area. Marina Barrage also acts as a tidal barrier to keep seawater out, helping to alleviate flooding in low-lying areas of the city such as Chinatown, Jalan Besar and Geylang. When it rains heavily during low-tide, the barrage's crest gates will be lowered to release excess water from the coastal reservoir into the sea. If heavy rain falls during high-tide, the crest gates remain closed and giant drainage pumps (made by Nijhuis Pumps, Winterswijk in the Netherlands) are activated to pump excess water out to sea. As the water in the Marina Basin is unaffected by the tides, the water level will be kept constant, making it ideal for all kinds of recreational activities such as boating, windsurfing, kayaking and dragonboating. Impact The building of the Marina Barrage required the relocation of Clifford Pier from Collyer Quay to Marina South (see Marina South Pier). It has proved to be a tourist attraction. Marina Barrage is open for viewing 24/7. The information counter is open from 9.00am to 9.00pm daily. Tours for a maximum capacity of 80 people to the Visitor Centre can be arranged prior to arrival. From 2012 onward, it played host to annual public youth community and cosplay event EOY Cosplay Festival. Awards The Marina Barrage was conferred the Superior Achievement Award - the highest honour of the competition for the best project entry - at the AAEE Annual Awards Luncheon held in Washington, DC, USA on 6 May 2009. The Marina Barrage beat 33 other entries to take home the top prize in this year's competition organised by the American Academy of Environmental Engineers (AAEE), becoming the second project outside of USA to win the award, in the last decade.

The other most plentiful birds in the bay include: The sooty tern, bridled tern, white ibis, glossy ibis, little blue heron, cocoi heron, bare-throated tiger heron, black-crowned night heron, blue footed booby, brown booby, magnificent frigatebird, great egret, and snowy egret. The seabirds also are an indicator of the health of the fish, which rely on the nutrient-rich debris of the mangroves to survive.Angehr, George R. \\"Seabird and Colonial Wading Bird Nesting in the Gulf of Panama.\\" Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology 30.3 (2007): 335-57. JSTOR. Web. 09 Feb. 2016. Mangroves have also been used by local communities for centuries for their charcoal, long-lasting fuel wood, poles, bark, and are still an important part of the local communities to this day. Since the seafood and nutrients are abundant in the waters of the bay, it has been proved an advantageous place to live for thousands of years, dating back to the late Preceramic Period, around 6000 BC. A recent discovery of dolphin remains in a Preceramic hunter-gatherer encampment on the Pearl Islands suggests that the ancient inhabitants of the islands did not only hunt small fish, but larger ones such as dolphins and sharks. The nutrient-rich water draws a significant amount of fish and sea animals to the Panama Bay, giving the ancient hunter-gatherers a wide variety to choose from. Evidence was found that these inhabitants lived mainly off of fish and turtles in the bay, but dolphins and sharks were also exploited for their meat, bones, and oil. One major problem that researchers found was that it is unclear whether the primitive hunter-gatherers systematically hunted the dolphins, or merely herded them towards the islands until they became beached. Nonetheless, this is still an important discovery as it is the first Preceramic site identified in the Pearl Islands, as well as the first evidence in Central America that the early inhabitants exploited dolphins for food.  Environmental concerns  There has been concern recently relating to the environmental health of the Panama Bay, as industry has grown significantly in the Panama City area in recent years, specifically the oil industry. Petroleum is both a major import and export of Panama City, and as such, the concern for oil spills and how they would affect the bay is significant. Another great concern is the destruction and utilization of the mangroves in the bay. Both the wildlife in the bay and the human population rely on the mangroves for survival.D‚ÄôCroz L. 1993. Status and uses of mangroves in the Republic of Panam√°. L.D. Lacerda, editor. Conservation and sustainable utilization of Mangrove Forests in Latin America and Africa Regions. Part 1; Volume 2. The mangroves in the bay are also not only threatened by siltation by excessive erosion, dam construction, and pesticides from the local farms, but also by the utilization of these mangroves for industrial farming.  Laws and regulations  The creation of the Panama Canal in 1914 was a major breakthrough in terms of international transport, as it formed Panama and the surrounding area as a new international hub of trade and transport. However, although it brought business to the area, the new boom in transport in the area took a major toll on the environment. As the Panamanian economy has grown over the years, so have the laws and policies relating to it, specifically marine policy. Marine resources in and around the Panama Bay are key to many major industries such as farming and fishing, and over 80% of the surrounding population directly rely on them to survive. Although the laws that have been put into place over the years made major changes to the infrastructure and government, there are still major gaps in the enforcement and structure of these laws.Spalding, Ana K., Daniel O. Suman, and Maria Eugenia Mellado. \\"Navigating the Evolution of Marine Policy in Panama: Current Policies and Community Responses in the Pearl Islands and Bocas Del Toro Archipelagos of Panama.\\" Marine Policy 62 (2015): 161‚Äì168. Web. 9 Feb. 2016 Many of the laws put into place did not have conservation of the environment in mind, and mainly focused on business. Water treatment is a major problem in the Panama Bay, as much of the once pure water is now polluted with sewage and chemical waste. Sewage treatment is poor in a large portion of Panama, and due to the lack of proper waste management plants, raw sewage from sewage tanks is often dumped into the bay with little to no treatment. Panama City and the surrounding areas draw clean drinking water from the Panama Canal watershed, but the recent boom in urbanization and pollution threatens the quality of the drinking water. The Panamanian Government as well as non-governmental organizations are working towards conservation of the watershed, but the loose laws towards industry and waste management make this hard to achieve.  Conservation efforts  In 2009, The Panama Bay was declared a \\"Wetland of International Importance\\" by the Ramsar Convention, an international convention for the protection of wetlands of international importance. However, this status was temporarily suspended in 2012 by the Panamanian Government to protect Industry and farming. This sparked controversy amongst environmentalists, and in 2013 the bay regained protected status under the Panamanian Supreme court, with the help and support of the Panama Audubon Society. In February 2015, the Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela signed into law the ban of construction in the 210,000 acre area of the Bay of Panama, and declared the bay a \\"wetlands complex as a protected wildlife refuge area\\". This action was controversial within the Panamanian Government as the previous president, Ricardo Martinelli, was criticized by environmentalists for his neglect of the destruction of the mangroves in the Panama Bay. This law was put into place mainly to conserve the mangrove forests and stop erosion, as well as to protect the habitats of the migratory shorebirds.

The local pronunciation is \\"Khardong La\\" or \\"Khardzong La\\" but, as with most names in Ladakh, the romanised spelling varies. The pass on the Ladakh Range is north of Leh and is the gateway to the Shyok and Nubra valleys. The Siachen Glacier lies part way up the latter valley. Built in 1976, it was opened to public motor vehicles in 1988. Maintained by the Border Roads Organisation, the pass is strategically important to India as it is used to carry supplies to the Siachen Glacier. The elevation of Khardung La is .DGPS Document supplied by the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia Local summit signs and dozens of stores selling shirts in Leh incorrectly claim that its elevation is in the vicinity of and that it is the world's highest motorable pass. Two air warriors of India Air Force Wg Cdr Gajanand Yadava and WO AK Tiwari undertook heighest skydive landing at this pass on 8 Oct 20 and made a new record. History Khardong La is historically important as it lies on the major caravan route from Leh to Kashgar in Central Asia. About 10,000 horses and camels used to take the route annually, and a small population of Bactrian camels can still be seen at Hunder, in the area north of the pass. In the early 1950s, William O. Douglas described \\"the trail, after crossing the Indus, divides, one fork going south along the river's edge to Spitok, Khalatse and Khargil, the other turning north to Leh, the Khardong Pass (...), and Yarkand, an ancient trading center of Sinkiang.\\" He continues, \\"Leh is on a historic caravan route that leads not only to Yarkand in Sinkiang but to Lhasa in Tibet. (...) the stream of trade. Wool, silver, felts, tea, candy, skins, velvets, silk, gold, carpets, musk, coral, borax, jade cups, salt came down from the north. Cotton goods, shawls, brocades, opium, indigo, plumes, shoes, pearls, ginger, cloves, pepper, honey, tobacco, sugar cane, barley rice, wheat, corn came up from the south.\\" During World War II there was an attempt to transfer war material to China through this route.. Location A memorial at Khardung La Khardung La office and shop Khardung La is 39 km by road from Leh. Earlier, the first 24 km, as far as the South Pullu check point, were paved. From there to the North Pullu checkpoint about 15 km beyond the pass the roadway was primarily loose rock, dirt, and occasional rivulets of snow melt. Now, all the way is properly paved. The road approaching the Nubra Valley is very well maintained (except in a few places where washouts or falling rock occur). Hired vehicles (two and four-wheel-drive), heavy trucks, and motorcycles regularly travel into the Nubra Valley, though special permits are required to be arranged for travellers. The elevation measure from hundreds of GPS surveys matches SRTM data, ASTER GDEM data, and Russian topographic mapping. It is broadly consistent with numerous GPS reports. Access The nearest sizable town is Leh. Leh is connected by road from Manali and Srinagar, and daily flights are operated from Delhi. From Leh, a daily bus service to Nubra Valley passes over Khardung La which may also be reached by a hired car with an experienced driver or by motorcycle. The two bases on either side of Khardung La are North Pullu and South Pullu. An Inner Line Permit (ILP), which can be acquired at the District Commissioner‚Äôs office in Leh, is required for tourists (not needed for Ladakh citizens). People are required to check in en route and must provide photocopies of the permits to be deposited at each checkpoint. Altitude sickness is a serious health concern for people not acclimatised to high altitudes. Prophylactic altitude-sickness medication such as acetazolamide may be necessary for some as there are no emergency medical facilities to treat altitude sickness along the route. The road is closed from approximately October to May due to snow and is often subject to long delays due to traffic congestion on narrow one-lane sections, washouts, landslides and road accidents. Climate Khardung La has an arctic tundra climate (ET) with short, cool summers and long, very cold winters.

It is monotypic, the only member of the genus Limnothlypis. Swainson's warbler was named after William Swainson, an English ornithologist. Description \\"Sheepshead\\" sanctuary - Texas (flash photo ) Swainson's warblers are a small and rather nondescript songbird, though are fairly large for a New World warbler. Adults grow to in length and in weight. The wingspan averages .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . They are a plain olive-brown above and pale yellow-white below. They have a whitish eyebrow stripe that runs above their eye, and the top of their head is a rusty brown. Unlike most other New World warblers that are mostly dimorphic, there is no difference in appearance between a male or female Swainson's warbler. Distribution and habitat Swainson's warblers are uncommon, mostly found in flooded swamplands and canebrakes of the south- eastern United States. More rarely, they will also occur in rhododendron thickets in the southern Appalachian Mountains. They are a migratory species, with part of the population migrating southeastwards to the Greater Antilles (where it overwinters in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica for example) and the other southwestwards to the Yucat√°n Peninsula region in winter. Behavior =Breeding= This species begins breeding at about 10 months of age.Graves in Winker et al.' 2000 Pairs form, and stake out and defend a territory for nesting. Nests are fairly large and bulky, constructed from moss, grass, and small leaves situated above ground in a tangle of tall reeds or vines. The female will lay between three and five eggs. The eggs are white and sometimes, but rarely, speckled with brown. Incubation is done by the female only and lasts for about 14 days, after which the eggs will hatch. The young leave the nest about 12 days later. It is not known how long pairs stay together, although once a pair-bond has been established they do not usually mate with other birds at least in the current nesting season. These birds live to as old as eight years. Taxonomy No subspecies are recognized. There appears to be some divergence between populations from Arkansas and others of the coastal plains. This does fit a pattern one would expect from genetic drift, but there seem to be no geographical or ecological barriers restricting gene flow. Even during the last ice age, when average temperatures, precipitation and sea levels were lower, there seems to have been ample contiguous habitat. Clearly, some factor restricting gene flow is at work, but it is not presently known what it is. It is possible that the subpopulations conform to the different wintering areas.Winker et al. 2000 In some migrant birds it is known that the initial direction of the migration is set by fairly simple hereditary mechanisms. Offspring of pairs comprising birds of different subpopulations will, in such species, attempt to migrate into an intermediate direction. Such a course would lead a Swainson's warbler deep into the Caribbean where there are no wintering or even stopover points, and the bird would almost certainly perish. More research such as analyzing bird banding data is needed to determine whether this mechanism applies in Swainson's warbler. References *Winker, K., Graves, G. R. & Braun, M. J.

It uses a modified version of the Western 52-playing card deck; four cards with the same face value (typically 2's or 8's) are removed, leaving 48 cards. The game is sometimes called Fish or Canadian Fish, after the similar Go Fish, or Recollection.  Rules  The players are divided into two teams seated in alternating order. The 48 cards are dealt out to the players. Conceptually the 48 cards are divided into 8 half-suits, such as \\"low spades\\" or \\"high hearts\\"; see the Variations section below for specifics. The objective is to win more half-suits than the other team. Play proceeds with a player requesting a card from a player on the other team. Players may only request cards in half-suits that they already partly have, and players may not request cards that they already have. For example, to ask someone for the 3 of hearts, the player must have at least one card in low hearts and must not have the 3 of hearts itself. If the second player has the card requested, they transfer the card to the first player, who gets another turn. If the second player does not have the card requested, the turn goes to the second player. When a player has collected all the cards in a half-suit by themselves, they can lay it down face-up and win it for their team. If a half- suit is scattered among the player's own team members, a player can declare a set on their turn by announcing correctly who has what card in the half-suit, by saying something like: :Low spades, I have the 4 and 8, Mary has the 3, and Joseph has the 5, 6, and 7. If the player was not entirely correct in saying who had what card, but the entire half-suit was owned by their own team, then the half-suit is forfeit and neither side can win it. If the player was incorrect and one or more of the cards were owned by the other team, then the half-suit is awarded to the other team. Play continues until all half-suits have been accounted for. The team with more half-suits wins. Strategy Since players can only ask for cards they do not possess, using the questions asked to others in the game, a player can deduce the card or set of cards a player has. The best strategy for a player is to emit as much information as possible to his team-mates while simultaneously emitting as little information as possible to one's opponents. Thus good strategy consists not only of asking for some cards that one needs, but not prematurely divulging the existence of all the half-suits that one has. Players need both strategy and memory skills to win the game. Another common strategy adopted is the stalemate-breaker. If the members of a team come to the conclusion that all the cards in a set are all held by their own team and they can correctly attribute them, they don't declare the set immediately. This set is kept as a stalemate-breaker. If at a later point in the game a player in the team is at the verge of finishing a set (i.e., he knows which opponent has which card) but is unable to do so because he does not get a turn, the stalemate-breaker is used. One of his team-members can declare the stalemate-breaker set when he gets the turn and pass the turn to him. Variations Several variations exist, based on how cards are grouped into half-suits: * The 2s can be eliminated from the deck, using 3-8 as low and 9-A as high. * The 7s can be eliminated, using A-6 as low and 8-K as high. * The 8s can be eliminated, using 2-7 as low and 9-A as high. This variant is common in India. * The game can be played with 54 cards by adding the 2 jokers. The two jokers plus the four cards that are normally removed would form their own half-suit. Thus having nine half-suits makes it impossible for the two teams to tie; unless one of the sets is lost as a null set (depending on house rules; see below). The final amount would only consist of 8 sets. * One variant uses sets of four cards with matching numbers rather than lows and highs of suits. This would result in 13 sets each having the same face value. In addition, several house rules may be enforced, depending on the players: * Players may be required to declare a set as soon as they possess all the cards for that set. * Players may be required to announce when they have one card remaining, or announce and retire if they have no cards remaining. * Incorrect declarations may result either in the half-suit being forfeit, or in the half-suit awarded by default to the other team. This rule is sometimes enforced to penalize random guesses from players. * In some house rules the high set scores twice as many points as the low set. * A variant played by some advanced players is to allow people to ask for cards they already possess, in order to confuse opponents. This variant is not very common among most players, because it can make the game very complicated and confusing. * When a set is declared, the team gets to choose who gets to ask next. It is used to transfer the chance to a teammate, if needed.

It is named after a former heath in the East End of London. The northern boundary is formed by the Regent's Canal and the area includes Vyner Street, best known for its street art and galleries. The area is served by Cambridge Heath railway station, operated by London Overground. Toponymy The earliest written use of the name was by a scribe in the era of great orthographic variety, as Camprichthesheth, in 1275; other manifold variations soon followed.Mills, A., Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names, (2000) It could be unconnected with Cambridge instead from an Old English plant (such as comfrey) or unusual-form man's name. The area was once marshland and forest which, as Bishopswood, lingered in the east until the 16th century.Bethnal Green: Settlement and Building to 1836, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 91-95 accessed: 6 December 2007. History Cambridge Heath in 1983 The Bethnal Green gasworks in Cambridge Heath, named after the then-Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green were built in 1866 and 1889 by designer, John Clark. Prior to the 1960s the sites were used to manufacture and store town gas made from coal. Following the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea in the 1960s, the gas holders continued to be used to store natural gas. The Wilkinson Gallery opened on Cambridge Heath Road in 1998 before moving to Vyner Street in 2007. The gallery became known as one of the first in London to have exhibitions by major female artists such as Joan Jonas, Dara Birnbaum and Laurie Simmons. However the Wilkinson Gallery closed in 2017. Vyner Street in 2016. By around 2005, Vyner Street had become a hub of the East London art scene. Between 2005 and 2008, the EEL established the Vyner Street Festival with the local Victory Pub as a family festival with local bands, artists and market traders, this has a different theme every year, with the Red Arrows performing flyover in 2008. By 2012, however, many artists had moved out due to the effects of the Great Recession as well as the 2012 Olympics. A documentary film was released in the same year titled Vyner Street: this was a short observational piece about two different worlds living inconspicuously and side-by-side in the same place.

Cambridge Heath and Bethnal Green proper were unequal halves of the same manor, and in the 19th century both formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. This was incorporated into the newly created London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965. It is north and west of Bethnal Green, east of Haggerston, south-west of Hackney and west of Victoria Park.Vision of Britain - Bethnal Green MB boundaries It is largely part of the wider Regents Canal Conservation Area, established in 2008, the streetside buildings seem neglected but form part of the industrial heritage and character of Vyner Street and also Wadeson Street, which contains a row of three-storey Victorian workshops mostly converted to residential use.

Its capital was Sana'a until 1948, then Taiz. From 1962 to 1970, it maintained control over portions of Yemen (frequently most) until its final defeat in the North Yemen Civil War. Yemen was admitted to the United Nations on 30 September 1947.  History  =Background= Zaidi religious leaders expelled forces of the Ottoman Empire from what is now northern Yemen by the middle of the 17th century but, within a century, the unity of Yemen was fractured due to the difficulty of governing Yemen's mountainous terrain. In 1849, the Ottoman Empire occupied the coastal Tihamah region to put pressure on the Zaiddiyah imam to sign a treaty recognizing Ottoman suzerainty and allowing for a small Ottoman force to be stationed in Sana'a. However, the Ottomans were slow to gain control over Yemen and never managed to eliminate all resistance from local Zaydis. In 1913, shortly before World War I, the Ottoman Empire was forced to cede some power formally to highland Zaydis. =Independence= On 30 October 1918, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Imam Yahya Muhammad of the al- Qasimi dynasty declared northern Yemen an independent sovereign state. In 1926, Yahya proclaimed the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, becoming both a temporal king as well as a (Zaydi) spiritual leader, and won international recognition for his new state, such as with the Kingdom of Italy, entering into the Italo-Yemeni Treaty in 1926. =Consolidation= In the 1920s, Yahya had expanded his power to the north into Tihamah and 'Asir, but he collided with the rising influence of the Saudi king of Nejd and Hejaz, Abdul Aziz ibn Sa'ud. In the early 1930s, Saudi forces retook much of these gains before withdrawing from some of the area, including the southern Tihamah city of Al Hudaydah. The present-day boundary with Saudi Arabia was established by the 20 May 1934 Treaty of Taif, following the Saudi-Yemeni War in 1934. Yahya's non- recognition of his kingdom's southern boundary with the British Aden Protectorate (later the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen) that had been negotiated by his Ottoman predecessors resulted in occasional clashes with the British. In 1932, the governments of Yemen and the Kingdom of Iraq signed a treaty which led to the training of Yemeni Army officers in Iraq. Later, several of them would play a key role in the 1962 coup d'√©tat in North Yemen.Robert D. Burrowes: Historical Dictionary of Yemen, Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press 2000, p. 190. The Kingdom of Yemen became a founding member of the Arab League in 1945 and joined the United Nations on 30 September 1947. It committed a small expeditionary force to the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.Morris, Benny (2008), 1948: The First Arab-Israeli War, Yale University Press, p.205, New Haven, . =Instability and decline= Imam Yahya was assassinated in an unsuccessful coup d'√©tat in 1948 but was eventually succeeded by a firm heir - Yahya's son, Imam Ahmad bin Yahya, who regained power several months later. His reign was marked by growing development, openness and renewed friction with the United Kingdom over the British presence in the south that stood in the way of his aspirations for the creation of Greater Yemen. He was slightly more forward-thinking than his father and was more open to foreign contacts. Nonetheless, his regime, like his father's, was autocratic and semi-medieval in character; even the most mundane measures required his personal approval. In March 1955, a coup by a group of officers and two of Ahmad's brothers briefly deposed the king but was quickly suppressed. Ahmad faced growing pressures, supported by the Arab nationalism objectives of President of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser and, in April 1956, he signed a mutual defense pact with Egypt. In 1958, Yemen joined the United Arab Republic (a federation of Egypt and Syria) in a confederation known as the United Arab States, but this confederation was dissolved soon after Syria withdrew from the United Arab Republic and the United Arab States in September 1961. Relations between Egypt and Yemen subsequently deteriorated. Imam Ahmad died in September 1962 and was succeeded by his son, the Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr, whose reign was brief. Egyptian-trained military officers inspired by Nasser and led by the commander of the royal guard, Abdullah as-Sallal, deposed him the same year of his coronation, took control of Sana'a, and created the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). This fighting sparked the North Yemen Civil War and created a new front in the Arab Cold War, in which Egypt assisted the YAR with troops and supplies to combat forces loyal to the imamate, while the monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Jordan supported Badr's royalist forces opposing the newly formed republic. Conflict continued periodically until 1967 when Egyptian troops were withdrawn. By 1968, following a final royalist siege of Sana'a, most of the opposing leaders reached a reconciliation, and Saudi Arabia recognized the republic in 1970.

In English, the wordt nusach means formulate, wording. Textual nusach is distinct from musical nusach, which refers to the musical style or tradition of a community, particularly the chant used for recitative prayers such as the Amidah. Meanings Nusach primarily means \\"text\\" or \\"version\\", the correct wording of a religious text or liturgy. Thus, the nusach tefillah is the text of the prayers, either generally or in a particular community. In common use, nusach has come to signify the entire liturgical tradition of the community, including the musical rendition. It is one example of minhag, which includes traditions on Jewish customs of all types. Varieties =Nusach Ashkenaz= Nusach Ashkenaz is the style of service conducted by Ashkenazi Jews, originating from central and eastern Europe. It is the shortest lengthwise (except for the \\"Baladi\\" Yemenite Nusach). It may be subdivided into the German, or western, branch (\\"Minhag Ashkenaz\\"), used in western and central Europe, and the Polish/Lithuanian branch (\\"Minhag Polin\\"), used in eastern Europe, the United States and among Ashkenazim, particularly those who identify as \\"Lithuanian\\", in Israel. The form used in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth (except Canada, which follows the American style), known as \\"Minhag Anglia\\", is technically a subform of \\"Minhag Polin\\" but has many similarities to the German rite. See Singer's Siddur. =Nusach Sefard= Nusach Sefard is the style of service used by some Jews of central and eastern European origins, especially Hasidim, who adopted some Sephardic customs emulating the practice of the Ari's circle of kabbalists, most of whom lived in the Land of Israel. Textually speaking it is based on the Sephardic rite, but in melody and feel it is overwhelmingly Ashkenazi. =Nusach Ari= Nusach Ari is a variant of Nusach Sefard, used by Chabad Hasidim. =Sephardi and Mizrachi nuschaot= There is not one generally recognized uniform nusach for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews. Instead, Sephardim and Mizrahim follow several slightly different but closely related nuschaot. The nearest approach to a standard text is found in the siddurim printed in Livorno from the 1840s until the early 20th century. These (and later versions printed in Vienna) were widely used throughout the Sephardic and Mizrahi world. Another popular variant was the text known as Nusach ha-Hida, named after Chaim Yosef David Azulai. Both these versions were particularly influential in Greece, Iran, Turkey and North Africa. However, most communities also had unwritten customs which they would observe, rather than following the printed siddurim exactly: it is easy, from the printed materials, to get the impression that usage in the Ottoman Empire around 1900 was more uniform than it really was. Other variants include: *the customs of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, based on an older form of the Castilian rite, with some influence from the customs both of Italian Jews and of Northern Morocco. This version is distinguished by the near-absence of Kabbalistic elements. *Nusah Adot Hamizrah, originating among Iraqi Jews but now popular in many other communities. These are based on the opinions of Yosef Hayyim and have a strong Kabbalistic flavour. *Minhag Aram Soba, as used by Syrian Musta'arabi Jews in earlier centuries (the current Syrian rite is closely based on the Livorno prints). *the Moroccan rite, also related to the text of the Livorno prints but with a strong local flavour. This subdivides into the customs of the Spanish-speaking northern strip and the Arabic-speaking interior of the country. *formerly, there were variants from different parts of Spain and Portugal, perpetuated in particular synagogues in Thessaloniki and elsewhere, e.g. the Lisbon and Catalan rites, and some North African rites appear to reflect Catalan as well as Castilian influence. Under the influence of the former Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, a common nusach appears to be emerging among Israeli Sephardim, based largely on the Nusach Edot Hamizrach but omitting some of the Kabbalistic additions. =Nosach Teman= A \\"Temani\\" nosach was the standard among the Jews of Yemen. This is divided into the Baladi (purely Yemenite) and Shami (adopted from Sephardic siddurim)Note that Rabbi Shalom ben Aharon Ha- Kohen Iraqi would go to a different synagogue each Shabbath with printed Sefardic siddurim, requesting that they pray in the Sephardic rite and forcing it upon them if necessary (Rabbi Yosef Kapach, Passover Aggadta [Hebrew], p. 11). versions. Both rites are recited using the unique Yemenite pronunciation of Hebrew, which Yemenite Jews, and some scholars, regard as the most authentic, and most closely related to the Hebrew of Ancient Israel. The Baladi rite is very close to that codified by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah. One form of it is used by the Dor Daim, who attempt to safeguard the older Baladi tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance. This version used by dardaim was originally used by all Yemenite Jews near the time of Maimonides. =Nussach Eretz Yisrael= In the period of the Geonim, Jews in Israel followed the Nussach Eretz Yisrael which is based upon the Talmud Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud), while the Jewish diaspora followed the customs of Babylonian Jewry.Ha-Chilukim Bein Anshei Ha-Mizrach Uvne Eretz Yisrael, edition Margaliot, Jerusalem, 1928, \\"The differences between the people in the east and the people of Eretz Yisrael\\", from the early Geonic period; Nusach Eretz Yisrael. The modern Nusach Eretz Yisrael is a recent attempt by Rabbi David Bar-Hayim at reconstructing the ancient Nussach Eretz Yisrael, based on the Jerusalem Talmud and documents discovered in the Cairo Geniza and other sources. The reconstruction is published in the form of a siddur (\\"prayer book\\"), and used by Rabbi Bar-Hayim's Jerusalem followers in public prayers held in Machon Shilo's synagogue.Nusa·∏• Ere·π£ Yisrael :: Tefillat Min·∏•ah, Birkat HaMazon, and Tefillat HaDerekh =Other nuschaot= In addition, there are other nuschaot. *Nussach HaGR\\"A was a very brief version of Nussach Ashkenaz written by the Vilna Gaon, removing some passages which he believed had were not in the original prayer text, correcting some grammatical errors (according to him), and some additional small changes. *The Minhag Italiani and Minhag Ben√® Rom√¨ are used by some Italian Jews. *Closely related to these was the \\"Romaniote\\" riteSiddur Tefillot ha-Shanah le-minhag kehillot Romania, Venice 1523. from Greece where have lived an ancient, pre-Diaspora Jewish community. The surviving Romaniote synagogues are in Ioannina, Chalkis, Athens, Tel Aviv and New York, these now use a Sephardic rite but with romaniote variations, romaniote piyyutim, combined with own melodies and customs and their special form of Byzantine-Jewish Cantillation.Ross, M.

(The customs of Corfu are a blend between Romaniote, Apulian and Sephardic rites.)Connerty, Mary C. Judeo-Greek: The Language, The Culture. Jay Street Publishing, 2003. *There was once a French nusach, closely related to the Ashkenazi, which is now used only in certain towns in Northern Italy (see Appam). *Distinct PersianShelomo Tal, Nosa·∏• ha-Tefillah shel Yehude Paras. and Proven√ßalSeder ha-Tamid, Avignon 1776. nuschaot also existed before being gradually replaced by the Edot Hamizrach and Spanish and Portuguese nuschaot respectively. * The Urfalim Jews of south eastern Anatolia follow their own prayer rite, which differs from the Syrian, Kurdish and Iraqi Jewish rites. It is said among some mystics that an as-yet undisclosed nusach will be revealed after the coming of the Mashiach, the Jewish Messiah. Others say that the differences in nusach are derived from differences between the twelve tribes of Israel, and that in Messianic times each tribe will have its proper nusach. The concept of one nusach for each of the 12 tribes was formulated by R' Isaac Luria; at the time there were exactly 12 Jewish communities in Luria's city of Safed, and each community's nusach was meant to stand in place of that of one of the tribes. Joseph Davis, The Reception of the \\"Shul·∏•an 'Arukh\\" and the Formation of Ashkenazic Jewish Identity, AJS Review: Vol. 26, No. 2 (Nov., 2002), pp. 251-276 (26 pages), pages 254-256.

It is credited with exposing, early on, the dangers of Nazism to the American public.  Life  Kathrine Kressmann moved to San Francisco after graduating from the University of Oregon in 1924 and worked as an advertising copywriter. In 1928, Kressmann married Elliott Taylor, who owned an advertising agency. Ten years later, the couple moved to New York, where Story magazine published Address Unknown. The editor Whit Burnett and Elliot deemed the story \\"too strong to appear under the name of a woman,\\" and published the work under the name Kressmann Taylor, dropping her first name. She used this name professionally for the rest of her life. Reader's Digest soon reprinted the novel, and Simon & Schuster published it as a book in 1939, selling 50,000 copies. Foreign publications followed quickly, including a Dutch translation, later confiscated by Nazis, and a German one, published in Moscow. The book was banned in Germany. An indictment of Nazism was also the theme of Taylor's next book, Until That Day, published in 1942. In 1944, Columbia Pictures turned Address Unknown into a movie. The film director and production designer was William C. Menzies (Gone with the Wind), and Paul Lukas starred as Martin. The screenplay, written by Herbert Dalmas, was credited also to Kressmann Taylor. In Russian, there was another screenplay by David Greener, but it was never filmed. From 1947, Taylor taught humanities, journalism and creative writing at Gettysburg College, in Pennsylvania, and, when Elliot Taylor died in 1953, lived as a widow. Retiring in 1966, she moved to Florence, Italy and wrote Diary of Florence in Flood, inspired by the great flood of the Arno river in November of that year. In 1967, Taylor married the American sculptor John Rood. Thereafter, they lived half a year in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and half in Val de Pesa, near Florence. Taylor continued this style of living after her second husband's death in 1974. In 1995, when Taylor was 91, Story Press reissued Address Unknown to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camps. The story was subsequently translated into 20 languages, with the French version selling 600,000 copies. The book finally appeared in Germany in 2001, and was reissued in Britain in 2002. In Israel, the Hebrew edition was a best-seller and was adapted for the stage. There has already been over 100 performances of the stage show, and it was filmed for TV and broadcast on the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day, January 27. Rediscovered after Address Unknown's reissue, Taylor spent a happy final year signing copies and giving interviews until her death at age 93.  Works  = Address Unknown (1938)= Martin, a gentile, returns with his family to Germany, exhilarated by the advances in the old country since the humiliation of the Great War. His business partner, Max, a Jew, remains in the States to keep the business going. The story is told entirely in letters between them, from 1932 to 1934. Martin writes about the \\"wonderful\\" Third Reich and a man named \\"Hitler.\\" At first Max is covetous: \\"How I envy you! ... You go to a democratic Germany, a land with a deep culture and the beginnings of a fine political freedom.\\" Max soon however has misgivings about his friend's new enthusiasms, having heard from eyewitnesses who had gotten out of Berlin that Jews were being beaten and their businesses boycotted. Martin responds, telling Max that, while they may be good friends, everybody knows that Jews have been the universal scapegoats, and \\"a few must suffer for the millions to be saved.\\" \\"This Jew trouble is only an incident,\\" Martin writes. \\"Something bigger is happening.\\" Nonetheless, he asks Max to stop writing to him. If a letter were intercepted, he (Martin) would lose his official position and he and his family would be endangered. Max continues to write regardless when his own sister, Griselle, an actress in Berlin, goes missing. He becomes frantic to learn her fate. Martin responds on bank stationery (less likely to be inspected) and tells Max his sister is dead. He admits that he turned Griselle away when she came to him, her brother's dearest friend, for sanctuary ‚Äì she had foolishly defied the Nazis and was being pursued by SA thugs. (It is revealed earlier in the book that Martin and Griselle had had an affair before the events of the book take place.) After a gap of about a month, Max starts writing to Martin at home, carrying only what looks like business and remarks about the weather, but writing as though they have a hidden encoded meaning, with strange references to exact dimensions of pictures and so on. The letters refer to \\"our grandmother\\" and imply that Martin is also Jewish. The letters from Munich to San Francisco get shorter and more panicky, begging Max to stop: \\"My God, Max, do you know what you do? ... These letters you have sent ... are not delivered, but they bring me in and ... demand I give them the code ... I beg you, Max, no more, no more! Stop while I can be saved.\\" Max however continues, \\"Prepare these for distribution by March 24th: Rubens 12 by 77, blue; Giotto 1 by 317, green and white; Poussin 20 by 90, red and white.\\" The letter is returned to Max, stamped: Adressat unbekannt. Addressee Unknown. (The title of the book is actually a mistranslation of Adressat unbekannt: The correct translation of \\"Adressat\\" is \\"addressee,\\" not \\"address\\"; which is much more in keeping with the plot of the story.) The book's afterword, lovingly written by Taylor's son, reveals that the idea for the story came from a small news article: American students in Germany wrote home with the truth about the Nazi atrocities, a truth most Americans, including Charles Lindbergh, would not accept. Fraternity brothers thought it would be funny to send them letters making fun of Hitler, and the visiting students wrote back, \\"Stop it. We‚Äôre in danger. These people don‚Äôt fool around. You could murder [someone] by writing letters to him.\\" Thus emerged the idea of \\"letter as weapon\\" or \\"murder by mail.\\" Address Unknown was performed as a stage play in France, 2001, in Israel from 2002 (where it still runs) and at the Promenade Theater in New York in 2004. It has also been performed in Germany, Italy, Turkey, Argentina, South Africa and in various other US cities. Address Unknown (Cimzett Ismeretlen) premiered on the stage of Spinoza Haz in Budapest, Hungary on September 6, 2008 and was performed in the Tron Theatre Glasgow as part of the Mayfesto season from 15 to 22 May 2010. It was performed at the Koninklijke Schouwburg in the Hague in the Netherlands in May 2011. In 2013 it was brought to the Soho Theatre in London.Dominic Cavendish (4 July 2013) \\"Address Unknown, Soho Theatre, review\\", The Telegraph. Retrieved 5 February 2017. An adaptation for BBC Radio 4 was broadcast in June 2008 as an Afternoon Play. It starred Henry Goodman as Max and Patrick Malahide as Martin and was adapted and directed by Tim Dee. = Until That Day (1942) = The novel recounts the story of Karl Hoffmann, a young German Christian and son of a Lutheran pastor. Hoffman starts his theology studies in Berlin in the late 1920s. Germany is still in a depression following its defeat in World War I, and this situation is the soil from which Nazism's influence grows. Hitler comes to power and starts persecutions against the Church, which refuses to preach the Nazi doctrine. Karl's father resists the authorities, and this resistance becomes the cause of his death. Karl, in his turn, continues his father's struggle and takes a stand against the Nazi takeover of the Church. He decides to become a pastor himself, but his ordination is denied. His life becomes endangered, and he escapes to the United States. The novel is also based on the life of a real person, Leopold Bernhard. Kathrine Taylor met him through the mediation of the FBI, which had investigated the young German after his defection to the United States.

The method makes the documented analysis so precise that it is possible to implement the analysis model directly by translation to the target architecture, rather than by elaborating model changes through a series of more platform-specific models. In the new millennium the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method has migrated to the UML notation, becoming Executable UML.  Overview  History of object-oriented methods and notations since the late 1980s The Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method is one of a number of software development methodologies which arrived in the late 1980s. Most familiar were Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) by Grady Booch, Object Modeling Technique (OMT) by James Rumbaugh, Object-Oriented Software Engineering by Ivar Jacobson and Object- Oriented Analysis (OOA) by Shlaer and Mellor.Andreas Zendler (1997) Advanced Concepts, Life Cycle Models and Tools for Objeckt-Oriented Software Development. p. 122Martin Fowler (2004) A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language. p. 7 These methods had adopted a new object-oriented paradigm to overcome the established weaknesses in the existing structured analysis and structured design (SASD) methods of the 1960s and 1970s.Robert J. M√ºller (1999) Database Design for Smarties: Using Uml for Data Modeling. p. 106. M√ºller adds here: Much of the work in OO modeling had its roots in data modeling, the fit with database design was fairly good. Of these well-known problems, Shlaer and Mellor chose to address: * The complexity of designs generated through the use of structured analysis and structured design (SASD) methods. * The problem of maintaining analysis and design documentation over time. Before publication of their second book in 1991 Shlaer and Mellor had stopped naming their method \\"Object-Oriented Systems Analysis\\" in favor of just \\"Object-Oriented Analysis\\". The method started focusing on the concept of Recursive Design (RD), which enabled the automated translation aspect of the method. What makes Shlaer‚ÄìMellor unique among the object-oriented methods is: * the degree to which object-oriented semantic decomposition is taken, * the precision of the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor Notation used to express the analysis, and * the defined behavior of that analysis model at run-time. The general solution taken by the object-oriented analysis and design methods to these particular problems with structured analysis and design, was to switch from functional decomposition to semantic decomposition.Hassan Gomaa (2011) Software Modeling and Design: UML, Use Cases, Patterns, and Software Architectures. p. 10. Gomaa explains here: Shlaer and Mellor (1988, 1992), and Coad and Yourdon (1991, 1992). The emphasis in these methods was on modeling the problem domain, information hiding, and inheritance... For example, one can describe the control of a passenger train as: : load passengers, close doors, start train, stop train, open doors, unload passengers. Then a design becomes focused on the behavior of doors, brakes, and passengers, and how those objects (doors, brakes, etc.) are related and behave within the passenger train domain. Other objects, that provide services used by the passenger train domain, are modeled in other domains connected to the passenger train domain.  Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method topics  = Translation v. elaboration = The goal of the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method is to make the documented analysis so precise that it is possible to implement the analysis model directly by translation rather than by elaboration. In Shlaer‚ÄìMellor terminology this is called recursive design. In current (2011) terminology, we would say the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method uses a form of model-driven architecture (MDA) normally associated with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). By taking this translative approach, the implementation is always generated (either manually, or more typically, automatically) directly from the analysis. This is not to say that there is no design in Shlaer‚ÄìMellor, rather that there is considered to be a virtual machine that can execute any Shlaer‚ÄìMellor analysis model for any particular hardware/software platform combination. This is similar in concept to the virtual machines at the heart of the Java programming language and the Ada programming language, but existing at analysis level rather than at programming level. Once designed and implemented, such a virtual machine is re-usable across a range of applications. Shlaer‚ÄìMellor virtual machines are available commercially from a number of tool vendors, notably Abstract Solutions, Mentor Graphics and Pathfinder Solutions. = Semantic decomposition = Shlaer‚ÄìMellor proposes a semantic decomposition in multiple (problem) domains.Martin Reddy (2011) API Design for C++. p.126. Reddy states: The Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method first partitions a system horizontally to create generic ‚Äúdomains‚Äù and then partitions these vertically by applying a separate analysis to each domain... One of the benefits of this divide-and-conquer approach is that domains tend to form reusable concepts that van be applied to other design problems. * The split between analysis and design models: The analysis domain expresses precisely what the system must do, the design domain is a model of how the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor virtual machine operates for a particular hardware and software platform. These models are disjoint, the only connection being the notation used to express the models. * Decomposition within the analysis domain where system requirements are modelled, and grouped, around specific, disjoint, subject matters. To return to the earlier passenger train example, individual semantic models may be created based on door actuators, motor controls, and braking systems. Each grouping is considered, and modelled, independently. The only defined relationship between the groupings are dependencies e.g. a passenger train application may depend on both door actuation and motor control. Braking systems may depend upon motor control. Domain models of door actuators, motor controls, and braking systems would typically be considered as generic re-usable service domains whereas the passenger train controller domain is likely to be a very product-specific application domain. A particular system is composed of domains and the defined bridges between the domains. A bridge is described in the terms of the assumptions held by the domain acting as a client bridged to a domain acting as a server.Sally Shlaer, Stephen Mellor (1991) Object Lifecycles: Modeling the World in States, p.142. = Precise action language = One of the requirement for automated code generation is to precisely model the actions within the finite-state machines used to express dynamic behaviour of Shlaer‚ÄìMellor objects. Shlaer‚ÄìMellor is unique amongst object-oriented analysis methods in expressing such sequential behavior graphically as Action Data Flow Diagrams (ADFDs). In practice the tools that supported Shlaer‚ÄìMellor, provided a precise action language. The action languages superseded the ADFD approach, so all actions are written in textual form. = Test and simulation = The translative approach of the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method lends itself to automated test and simulation environmentsMarcel Toussaint (1996) Ada in Europe: Second International Eurospace-Ada-Europe Symposium, Frankfurt, Germany, October 2‚Äì6, 1995, Volume 2. p.172 confirms: ... analysis and design using Object-Oriented (OO) techniques (in this case Shlaer‚ÄìMellor) and a Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool giving the possibility for automatic code generation and more reuse in subsequent simulators. (by switching the target platform during code generation), and this may partly explain the popularity of Shlaer‚ÄìMellor and other MDA-based methods when developing embedded systems, where testing on target systems e.g. mobile phones or engine management systems, is particularly difficult. What makes such testing useful and productive is the concept of the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor virtual machine. As with most OOA/OOD methods, Shlaer‚ÄìMellor is an event- driven, message-passing environment. Onto this generic view, the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor virtual machine mandates a prioritised event mechanism built around State Models, which allows for concurrent execution of actions in different state machines. Since any implementation of Shlaer‚ÄìMellor requires this model to be fully supported, testing under simulation can be a very close model of testing on target platform. Whilst functionality heavily dependent upon timing constraints may be difficult to test, the majority of system behaviour is highly predictable due to the prioritized execution model.  Criticisms  There has never been a universally agreed textual language to express actions within the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor community. Tool vendors have defined their own copyrighted and controlled action languages. Graham (1994) described Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method as early example of object-oriented analysis, that could not really be regarded as object-oriented. According to Graham the method lacks \\"notion of inheritance. As described in their book it was little more than an object-based extension of data modelling.\\"Ian Graham (1994) Object- oriented methods. p.229 In line with comment Capretz (1996) argues that the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method \\"fails to account for the vast majority of object- oriented ideas and an ordinary graphical notation is prescribed\\", which is primarily taken \\"from entity‚Äìrelationship diagrams and data flow diagrams found in other structured methods\\".Luiz Fernando Capretz (1996) Object- Oriented Software: Design. p.77 Capretz describes OOSA as \\"analysis methodology with associated graphical notation, which is based on a variation of the Entity-Relationship Model combined with Structured Systems Analysis. The notation can be applied to describe objects, attributes and relationships, were a relationship indicates a link between objects.\\".

After the original organisation was liquidated in 2010, Redholt Limited changed its name to the National Computing Centre Limited (NCC Ltd) and acquired the assets of the original NCC through a pre-pack administration arrangement. This new for- profit company, formed in 2010, initially offered some of the same the services as the original NCC but in 2012 became a shell company as it had to file for protection from its creditors and make most of its staff redundant. Formation and early years The National Computing Centre was founded on 10 June 1966 by the Labour government, as an autonomous not-for-profit organisation, in order to be the \\"voice of the computer user\\", encourage the growth of computer usage in the UK and ensure that the necessary education and training was made available. NCC was one of the visible outcomes from Harold Wilson's \\"White Heat of Technology\\" speech and the formation of a Ministry of Technology, the others being the computer company International Computers Limited (ICL) and chip maker INMOS (both now defunct). Initially, most income came directly from government grants, but with the growth of NCC's commercial operations\\"...the NCC survived initially thanks to Filetab, a ground-breaking piece of interoperable report generating software it developed for mainframes...\\", ComputerWeekly.com this ceased in 1989. During the 1970s and 1980s NCC had a joint venture with Blackwell Publishing (NCC Blackwell) which was a significant publisher of academic computing books. Between 1989 and 1996 NCC operated with five main divisions ‚Äì education, consulting, escrow, membership services, and system engineering deriving income from membership fees and its commercial activities. A valued component was the Computer Validation Service, which ran Validation testing for Fortran77(A Certificate for Prospero Fortran was attached but not accepted by wikipedia) and Pascal. These validation tests were issued in accordance with a reciprocal agreement with General Services Administration in the United States. NCC Education In 1996, the National Computing Centre sold its overseas education business, NCC Education, to stave off a financial crisis that occurred when the company breached its borrowing limits. MBO, NCC Services Ltd and NCC Group plc In 1999, it sold its commercial divisions (turnover of less than ¬£10 million), which provided escrow, consultancy, system engineering services to its existing management team supported by ECI ventures for ¬£5 million. This new company was named NCC Services Limited and later became NCC Group Limited of which the National Computing Centre held a 20% share. John Perkins became the new Managing Director of National Computing Centre, which remained a not-for- profit membership organisation. The NCC Services Ltd management team of Managing Director Chris Pearse and directors John Morris, Peter Bird, and Chris Sadler was strengthened in March 2000 by the appointment of Rob Cotton as Finance Director and who also took over control of the Escrow division in May of that year, with Morris leaving at that time. Following a substantial fall off of revenues as Y2K came and passed, and due to the failure of the company before this date to invest in its general consultancy, security, system engineering and escrow business during the Y2K period, the group began to make monthly losses before the benefits of the changes to the escrow business instigated by Rob Cotton were felt and the company returned to profitability. Renamed NCC Group, in May 2000, and with escrow now the cornerstone of the group, Rob Cotton led a secondary management buy-out in 2003 valuing NCC Group at ¬£30 million and supported by Barclays Private Equity. At this point, the National Computing Centre sold its shares in NCC Group as did Pearse, Bird and Sadler who left the business. The NCC Group subsequently floated on the AIM stock market in 2004 for ¬£55 million and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007 with a market capitalisation of nearly ¬£390 million as of June 2014. Failure NCC received substantial proceeds from the sale of NCC Group Limited (circa ¬£11 million between 2000 and 2003 plus dividends) and from the multi-million sale of its Manchester city centre buildings (Armstrong House and Oxford House, now the home of NCC Group plc) to Bruntwood Group. Following the retirement of Perkins, Michael Gough was appointed as CEO in 2000 and NCC pursued a new strategy of rapidly developing and expanding its membership services by acquisition. In 2002 NCC adopted a policy of vigorous support for open-source software. Over the six years from 2000, and particularly after the second sale of its shares in NCC Group in 2003, acquisitions accelerated until all of the company's funds had been used to acquire a number of related companies, membership organisations, publications, publishing rights and to fund joint ventures. The acquisitions included: Management Consultancy News; Conspectus; CIO Connect; The Construction Industry Computing Association; Certus; The Evaluation Centre; Institute of IT Training; The Impact Programme; and PMP. Publishing rights acquired included the Naked Leader and joint ventures included: the NCC/Ashridge Business School MBA; NCC/AQA Applied ICT; and ProfIT. Funds were also spent on a major refurbishment of offices in Manchester, developing a quickly redundant hosting centre and leasing opulent offices in London, all of which was entirely inappropriate for an organisation of this size. Additionally, funds were spent attempting to develop new products and services including The Open Source Academy, The Evaluation Centre and NCC Midas Web Hosting all of which proved commercially unsuccessful. There was also an expensive re-branding exercise in which NCC re-branded as Principia, a brand that was quickly dropped and the NCC brand resumed, a move that seemed to echo a similarly named and equally disastrous re-branding of the UK Royal Mail to Consignia. The strategy initiated and implemented by Michael Gough totally failed and the National Computing Centre diminished rapidly in size and turnover. With the many millions received now spent, NCC continued to make unsustainable losses but there was no change in strategic direction. By 2007 to stem the losses NCC was forced to rapidly close or dispose of many of the acquisitions at a vast loss to the organisation as well as to close a number of only recently established operations. Michael Gough left the business in February 2008. In March 2008, Steve Markwell was appointed as Chief Executive but there was no improvement in the company's fortunes or significant change in strategic direction. The only significant asset remaining, Filetab, was transferred in 2009 to a new company called NCC Filetab whose Managing Director was also Managing Director of NCC. With losses and the size of the pension fund deficit increasing, the company was unable to meet its obligations and was placed into administration by its management. Administration, liquidation and pre-pack In February 2010, NCC went into administration and ultimately liquidation. The few remaining assets and intellectual property rights were transferred in a \\"pre-pack\\" administration arrangement to Redholt Ltd a new private company, thus distancing the new company from the NCC creditors, which included a substantial pension fund liability resulting in the insolvency of the pension fund later that year. Redholt Ltd was owned by a group of six shareholders, including former managers and two Directors of the insolvent National Computing Centre. Redholt Ltd, was renamed as The National Computing Centre Limited (NCC Ltd) in Feb 2011. In 2011 NCC Ltd extended its portfolio of services to include IT consulting, mainly as a virtual organisation through the use of independent associate consultants. The 'new' NCC Ltd was not a mutual not-for-profit organisation, but retained some of the member organisations of the liquidated company and initially it delivered some of the same products and services. By the end of 2011, the 'new' NCC Ltd once again faced financial difficulties and in 2012 it sought voluntary arrangements with its creditors to step away from its debts. The company had run up substantial losses, had not paid suppliers and had not filed accounts. Nearly all staff were laid off and the business having already left its iconic building in 2010 it finally left Manchester. The company was formally recorded at Companies House as being insolvent and in a voluntary arrangement as of 2 March 2012. The insolvency practitioner dealing with the companies affairs was Wilkins Kennedy of London. It would appear that from this point NCC Ltd was no longer recognised by any trade body, association or any part of government as the \\"voice of the computer user\\" and offered no substantial services to its client base and became a shell company. In July 2013 the registered address was changed to an accommodation address in London and between then and July 2017 the operational address was at times listed as Aston Abbotts in Buckinghamshire, Bournemouth and Welwyn Garden City. In July 2017 NCC Ltd changed its name to IT Accreditations Limited and the ncc.co.uk domain name and company name became the property of NCC Group plc, so ending 50 years of an organisation trading as The National Computing Centre.

The first tablet is only preserved in fragments (KBo XXI 10, KUB XL 13, and minor fragments), the second tablet survives in three copies, and can be restituted almost completely. The oldest copy (KUB XL 13) is fragmentary, but two younger copies (KUB XL 16, KBo VI 34) are well preserved. The text is in Old Hittite, with some scribal errors of the later copyists, and prescribes the oath to be taken by military commanders. More precisely, it describes a series of symbolic actions intended to represent the afflictions that should befall the oath-takers should they break their word. On one occasion, for example, women's clothing, a spindle and an arrow is brought before those swearing their allegiance. The arrow is broken, and they are told that should they break their oath, their weapons should likewise be broken, and they should be made women and given women's tasks. Then, a blind and deaf woman is brought before them, and they are told that if they break their word, they will be made blind and deaf women like this one. Then, a figurine of a person suffering from ascites is brought before them, and they are told that should they break their word, their bellies should swell with water, and the deities of the oath should eat their offspring (seed) within their bellies. The deities of the oath repeatedly invoked with the Akkado-Sumerian spelling NI≈† DINGIR (representing Hittite lengai-) are identified with the goddess of treaties Ishara and the moon god Kaskuh. To these similes, those swearing agree, saying \\"so be it\\". Oath-taking as conditional self-cursing in the event of oath-breaking is typical of other early Indo-European cultures. There is another, younger text (CTH 428) with similar content, termed the 'second military oath'. It is more fragmentary, and its main difference is that the oath-takers are promised well-being in case they keep their word, as well as being threatened by extinction should they break it. In comparison to the older oath, the younger text shows that the Hittite pantheon was increasingly influenced by Hurrian gods.

She first appeared in Ebla and was incorporated into the Hurrian pantheon, from which she found her way to the Hittite pantheon. In Hurrian and Semitic traditions, I≈°·∏´ara is a love goddess, often identified with Ishtar. Her cult was of considerable importance in Ebla from the mid 3rd millennium, and by the end of the 3rd millennium, she had temples in Nippur, Sippar, Kish, Harbidum, Larsa, and Urum. Ishara is the Hittite word for \\"treaty, binding promise\\", also personified as a goddess of the oath. Etymology The etymology of Ishara is unknown. The goddess appears from as early as the mid 3rd millennium as one of the chief goddesses of Ebla, and her name appears as an element in theophoric names in Mesopotamia in the later 3rd millennium (Akkad period). Variants of the name appear as A≈°·∏´ara (in a treaty of Naram-Sin of Akkad with Hita of Elam) and U≈°·∏´ara (in Ugarite texts). In Ebla, there were various logographic spellings involving the sign AMA \\"mother\\". In Alalah, her name was written with the Akkadogram I≈†TAR plus a phonetic complement -ra, as I≈†TAR-ra. Origin Ishara is a pre-Hurrian and perhaps pre-Semitic deity, later incorporated into the Hurrian pantheon. From the Hurrian pantheon, Ishara entered the Hittite pantheon and had her main shrine in Kizzuwatna. Worship \\"Ishara first appears in the pre-Sargonic texts from Ebla and then as a goddess of love in Old Akkadian potency-incantations (Biggs). During the Ur III period she had a temple in Drehem and from the Old Babylonian time onwards, there were sanctuaries in Sippar, Larsa, and Harbidum. In Mari she seems to have been very popular and many women were called after her, but she is well attested in personal names in Babylonia generally up to the late Kassite period. Her main epithet was belet rame, lady of love, which was also applied to Ishtar. In the Epic of Gilgamesh (Tablet II, col. v.28) it says: 'For Ishara the bed is made' and in Atra-hasis (I 301-304) she is called upon to bless the couple on the honeymoon.\\" =Hurrian pantheon= Ishara was also worshipped within the Hurrian pantheon. She was associated with the underworld. Her astrological embodiment is the constellation Scorpio and she is called the mother of the Sebitti (the Seven Stars) (Seux, 343). Ishara was well known in Syria from the third millennium B.C. She became a great goddess of the Hurrian population. She was worshipped with Teshub and Simegi at Alakh, and also at Ugarit, Emar and Chagar Bazar. While she was considered to belong to the entourage of Ishtar, she was invoked to heal the sick (Lebrun).\\"Ishara/Eshara\\". Gwendolyn Leick. A Dictionary of Ancient Eastern Mythology. London. Routledge. 1991, pp. 94-95 =Hittite goddess= As a goddess, Ishara could inflict severe bodily penalties on oathbreakers, in particular ascites (see Hittite military oath). In this context, she came to be seen as a \\"goddess of medicine\\" whose pity was invoked in case of illness. There was even a verb, ' \\"to be afflicted by the illness of Ishara\\".

It was fought by forces from both the United States and the Philippines against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater. Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle. Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's founding, and Manila became one of the most devastated capital cities during the entire war, alongside Berlin and Warsaw. The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942‚Äì1945). The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. It is the last of the many battles fought within Manila's history. Background On 9 January 1945, the Sixth U.S. Army under Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger waded ashore at Lingayen Gulf and began a rapid drive south in the Battle of Luzon. On 12 Jan., MacArthur ordered Krueger to advance rapidly to Manila. The 37th Infantry Division, under the command of Major Gen. Robert S. Beightler, headed south. After landing at San Fabian on 27 Jan., the 1st Cavalry Division, under the command of Major Gen. Vernon D. Mudge, was ordered by MacArthur on 31 Jan., to \\"Get to Manila! Free the internees at Santo Tomas. Take Malacanang Palace and the Legislative Building.\\". On 31 January, the Eighth United States Army of Lt. Gen. Robert L. Eichelberger, including the 187th and 188th Glider Infantry Regiments of Col. Robert H. Soule, and components of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division under Maj. Gen. Joseph Swing, landed unopposed at Nasugbu in southern Luzon and began moving north toward Manila. Meanwhile, the 11th A/B Division's 511th Regimental Combat Team, commanded by Col. Orin D. \\"Hard Rock\\" Haugen, parachuted onto Tagaytay Ridge on 4 February.Col. Orin D. \\"Hard Rock\\" HaugenHistory of the 511th Airborne Regiment On 10 Feb., the 11th Airborne Division came under the command of the Sixth Army, and seized Fort William McKinley on 17 Feb. Swing was joined by the Hunters ROTC Filipino guerrillas, under the command of Lt. Col. Emmanuel V. de Ocampo, and by 5 Feb., they were on the outskirts of Manila. =Japanese defense= As the Americans converged on Manila from different directions, they found that most of the Imperial Japanese Army troops defending the city had been withdrawn to Baguio, on the orders of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, commander in chief of Japanese Army forces in the Philippines. Yamashita planned to engage Filipino and U.S. forces in northern Luzon in a co-ordinated campaign, with the aim of buying time for the build-up of defences against the pending Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands. He had three main groups under his command: 80,000 men of the Shimbu Group in the mountains east of Manila, 30,000 of the Kembu Group in the hills north of Manila, and 152,000 in the Shobu Group in northeastern Luzon.Connaughton, R., Pimlott, J., and Anderson, D., 1995, The Battle for Manila, London: Bloomsbury Publishing, General Yamashita did not declare Manila an open city, although General Douglas MacArthur had done so before its capture in 1941. Yamashita had not intended to defend Manila; he did not think that he could feed the city's one million residents and defend a large area with vast tracts of flammable wooden buildings. Yamashita did order the commander of Shimbu Group, Gen. Shizuo Yokoyama, to destroy all bridges and other vital installations and then evacuate the city as soon as any large American forces made their appearance. However, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi, commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 31st Naval Special Base Force, was determined to fight a last-ditch battle in Manila, and, though nominally part of the Shimbu Army Group, repeatedly ignored Army orders to withdraw from the city. The naval staff in Japan agreed to Iwabuchi's scheme, eroding a frustrated Yamashita's attempts at confronting the Americans with a concerted, unified defense.Sandler, Stanley ‚Äì World War II in the Pacific: An Encyclopedia, p.469; Taylor & Francis, 2001; , 9780815318835 Iwabuchi had 12,500 men under his command, designated the Manila Naval Defence Force, augmented by 4,500 army personnel under Col. Katsuzo Noguchi and Capt. Saburo Abe. They built defensive positions in the city, including Intramuros, cut down the palm trees on Dewey Blvd. to form a runway, and set up barricades across major streets. Iwabuchi formed the Northern Force under Noguchi, and the Southern Force under Capt. Takusue Furuse. Iwabuchi had been in command of the battleship when she was sunk by a US Navy task force off Guadalcanal in 1942, a blot on his honor which may have inspired his determination to fight to the death. Before the battle began, he issued an address to his men: > We are very glad and grateful for the opportunity of being able to serve our > country in this epic battle. Now, with what strength remains, we will > daringly engage the enemy. Banzai to the Emperor! We are determined to fight > to the last man.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia: Iwabuchi Sanji Battle =Santo Tomas internees liberated= Citizens of Manila run for safety from suburbs burned by Japanese soldiers, 10 February 1945 Map of the capture of Manila On 3 February, elements of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division under Maj. Gen. Verne D. Mudge pushed into the northern outskirts of Manila and seized a vital bridge across the Tullahan River, which separated them from the city proper, and quickly captured Malacanang Palace. A squadron of Brig. Gen. William C. Chase's 8th Cavalry, the first unit to arrive in the city, began a drive toward the sprawling campus of the University of Santo Tomas, which had been turned into the Santo Tomas Internment Camp for civilians and the US Army and Navy nurses sometimes known as the \\"Angels of Bataan\\". Since 4 January 1942, a total of thirty-seven months, the university's main building had been used to hold civilians. Out of 4,255 prisoners, 466 died in captivity, three were killed while attempting to escape on 15 February 1942, and one made a successful breakout in early January 1945. Capt. Manuel Colayco, a USAFFE guerrilla officer, became an allied casualty of the city's liberation, after he and his companion, Lt. Diosdado Guytingco, guided the American First Cavalry to the front gate of Santo Tomas. Struck by Japanese bullets, Colayco died seven days later in Legarda Elementary School, which became a field hospital. At 9 PM, five tanks of the 44th Tank Battalion, headed by \\"Battlin' Basic\\", headed into the compound. The Japanese, commanded by Lt. Col. Toshio Hayashi, gathered the remaining internees together in the Education Building as hostages, and exchanged pot shots with the Americans and Filipinos. The next day, 5 February, they negotiated with the Americans to allow them to rejoin Japanese troops to the south of the city, carrying only individual arms. The Japanese were unaware the area they requested, was the now American-occupied Malaca√±an Palace, and soon afterwards were fired upon and several were killed, including Hayashi. On 4 February, the 37th Infantry Division freed more than 1,000 prisoners of war, mostly former defenders of Bataan and Corregidor, held at Bilibid Prison, which had been abandoned by the Japanese. =Encirclement and massacres= Early on 6 February, General MacArthur announced that \\"Manila had fallen\\"; in fact, the battle for Manila had barely begun. Almost at once the 1st Cavalry Division in the north and the 11th Airborne Division in the south reported stiffening Japanese resistance to further advances into the city. General Oscar Griswold continued to push elements of the XIV Corps south from Santo Tomas University toward the Pasig River. Late on the afternoon on 4 February, he ordered the 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry Regiment, to seize Quezon Bridge, the only crossing over the Pasig that the Japanese had not destroyed. As the squadron approached the bridge, Japanese heavy machine guns opened fire from a formidable roadblock thrown up across Quezon Boulevard, forcing the cavalry to stop its advance and withdraw until nightfall. As the Americans and Filipinos pulled back, the Japanese blew up the bridge. On 5 February, the 37th Infantry Division began to move into Manila, and Griswold divided the northern section of the city into two sectors, with the 37th responsible for advancing to the south, and the 1st Cavalry Division responsible for an envelopment to the east. The Americans secured the northern bank of the Pasig River by 6 February, and had captured the city's water supply at the Novaliches Dam, Balara Water Filters, and the San Juan Reservoir. On 7 February, Gen. Beightler ordered the 148th Regiment to cross the Pasig River and clear Paco and Pandacan. The bitterest fighting for Manila ‚Äì which proved costliest to the 129th Regiment ‚Äì was in capturing the steam-driven power plant on Provisor Island, where the Japanese held out until 11 February. By the afternoon of 8 February, 37th Division units had cleared most of the Japanese from their sector, but the residential districts were damaged extensively. The Japanese added to the destruction by demolishing buildings and military installations as they withdrew. Japanese resistance in Tondo and Malabon continued until 9 February. Trying to protect the city and its civilians, MacArthur had stringently restricted U.S. artillery and air support. Yet, by 9 February, American shelling had set fire to a number of districts. \\"If the city were to be secured without the destruction of the 37th and the 1st Cavalry Divisions, no further effort could be made to save buildings, everything holding up progress would be pounded.\\" Iwabuchi's sailors, marines, and Army reinforcements, having initially had some success resisting American infantrymen armed with flamethrowers, grenades and bazookas, soon faced direct fire from tanks, tank destroyers, and howitzers, which blasted holes in one building after another, often killing both Japanese and civilians trapped inside, without differentiation.Echevarria de Gonzalez, Purita. Manila ‚Äì A Memoir of Love and Loss, Hale & Iremonger, 2000. . Subjected to incessant pounding and facing certain death or capture, the beleaguered Japanese troops took out their anger and frustration on the civilians caught in the crossfire, committing multiple acts of severe brutality, which later would be known as the Manila Massacre. Violent mutilations, rapes, and massacres of the populace accompanied the battle for control of the city. Massacres occurred in schools, hospitals and convents, including San Juan de Dios Hospital, Santa Rosa College, Santo Domingo Church, Manila Cathedral, Paco Church, St. Paul's Convent, and St. Vincent de Paul Church. Rizal Baseball Stadium, Manila, 16 February 1945 By 12 February Iwabuchi's artillery and heavy mortars had been destroyed, and with no plan for withdrawal or regrouping, \\"each man had his meager supply of rations, barely sufficient arms and ammunition, and a building in which his life would end...\\" The 1st Cavalry Division reached Manila Bay on 12 February, but it was not until 18 February that they took Rizal Stadium, which the Japanese had turned into an ammunition dump, and Fort San Antonio Abad. On 17 February, the 148th Regiment took the Philippine General Hospital, freeing 7,000 civilians, the University of the Philippines Padre Faura campus, and Assumption College San Lorenzo's original Herran-Dakota campus. Iwabuchi was ordered by Gen. Shizuo Yokoyama, commander of the Shimbu Group, to break out of Manila on the night of 17‚Äì18 February, in coordination with counter-attacks on Novaliches Dam and Grace Park. The breakout failed and Iwabuchi's remaining 6,000 men were trapped in Manila. The destruction of Manila, a quarter of a million civilian casualties, and the subsequent execution of General Yamashita for war crimes after the war was the result. 1,010 Americans, 16,665 Japanese and 100,000 to 240,000 civilians were killed.http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/82850-americans-destroyed- manila-1945 There was no animosity amongst the liberated Filipinos, claiming, \\"We were with the Americans! We were safe! We were liberated!\\" By 20 February, the New Police Station, St. Vincent de Paul Church, San Pablo Church, the Manila Club, City Hall and the General Post Office were in American hands. The Japanese retreated into Intramuros on the night of 19 February, and the Manila Hotel was liberated on 22 Feb., but MacArthur found his penthouse in ashes. Only Intramuros, plus the Legislative, Finance, and Agricultural Buildings, remained in Japanese hands. =Intramuros devastated= U.S. troops fighting in the Walled City, Manila, 27 February 1945 The assault on Intramuros started at 07:30 on 23 February, with a 140 gun artillery barrage, followed by the 148th attacking through breaches made in the walls between the Quezon and Parian Gates, and the 129th crossing the Pasig River, then attacking near the location of the Government Mint. The fighting for Intramuros continued until 26 February. Fewer than 3,000 civilians escaped the assault, mostly women and children who were released on the afternoon of 23 February.Robert Ross Smith, Triumph in the Philippines, United States Army in World War II, Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army, 1961, p.299 Colonel Noguchi's soldiers and sailors killed 1,000 men and women, while the other hostages died during the American shelling.Raphael Steinberg, Return to the Philippines, Time-Life, p.143; ^ Robert Ross Smith, Triumph in the Philippines, p.294, 299. Manila Cathedral after the war Iwabuchi and his officers committed seppuku (ritual suicide) at dawn on 26 February. The 5th Cavalry Regiment took the Agricultural Building by 1 March, and the 148th Regiment took the Legislative Building on 28 Feb. and the Finance Building by 3 March. Army Historian Robert R. Smith wrote: \\"Griswold and Beightler were not willing to attempt the assault with infantry alone. Not expressly enjoined from employing artillery, they now planned a massive artillery preparation that would last from 17 to 23 February and would include indirect fire at ranges up to 8,000 yards as well as direct, point- blank fire from ranges as short as 250 yards. They would employ all available corps and division artillery, from 240mm howitzers down. (...) Just how civilian lives could be saved by this type of preparation, as opposed to aerial bombardment, is unknown. The net result would be the same: Intramuros would be practically razed.\\"Robert Ross Smith, Triumph in the Philippines, United States Army in World War II, Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army, 1961, p.294 \\"That the artillery had almost razed the ancient Walled City could not be helped. To the XIV Corps and the 37th Division at this state of the battle for Manila, American lives were understandably far more valuable than historic landmarks. The destruction stemmed from the American decision to save lives in a battle against Japanese troops who had decided to sacrifice their lives as dearly as possible.\\"Robert Ross Smith, Triumph in the Philippines, United States Army in World War II, Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army, 1961 Before the fighting ended, MacArthur summoned a provisional assembly of prominent Filipinos to Malaca√±an Palace and in their presence declared the Commonwealth of the Philippines to be permanently reestablished. \\"My country kept the faith,\\" he told the gathered assembly. \\"Your capital city, cruelly punished though it be, has regained its rightful place‚Äîcitadel of democracy in the East.\\" Aftermath 250px Damage The Manila Post Office sustained fire damage in 1945. 250px 250px Like many other buildings in Manila, the Legislative Building was not spared from heavy shelling and bombing. For the rest of the month the Americans and Filipino guerrillas mopped up resistance throughout the city. With Intramuros secured on 4 March, Manila was officially liberated, albeit completely destroyed with large areas levelled by American bombing. The battle left 1,010 U.S. soldiers dead and 5,565 wounded. An estimated 100,000 to 240,000 Filipinos civilians were killed, both deliberately by the Japanese in the Manila massacre and from artillery and aerial bombardment by U.S. and Japanese forces. 16,665 Japanese dead were counted within Intramuros alone.http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/82850-americans-destroyed- manila-1945 =Destruction of the city= The battle for Manila was the first and fiercest urban fighting in the entire Pacific War. Few battles in the closing months of World War II exceeded the destruction and the brutality of the massacres and savagery of the fighting in Manila. In Manila's business district only two buildings were not damaged and those two were looted of their plumbing. A steel flagpole still stands today at the entrance to the old U.S. Embassy building in Ermita, pockmarked by numerous bullet and shrapnel hits, a testament to the intense, bitter fighting for the walled city. In this category, Manila is second to Stalingrad as being the city with the fiercest urban fighting during the war.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/247396/battle-of- manila-remembered/story/ Filipinos lost an irreplaceable cultural and historical treasure in the resulting carnage and devastation of Manila, remembered today as a national tragedy. Countless government buildings, universities and colleges, convents, monasteries and churches, and their accompanying treasures dating to the founding of the city, were ruined. The cultural patrimony (including art, literature, and especially architecture) of the Orient's first truly international melting pot ‚Äì the confluence of Spanish, American and Asian cultures ‚Äì was eviscerated. Manila, once touted as the \\"Pearl of the Orient\\" and famed as a living monument to the meeting of Asian and European cultures, was virtually wiped out. Most of the buildings damaged during the war were demolished after the Liberation, as part of rebuilding Manila, replacing European style architecture from the Spanish and early American era with modern American style architecture. Only a few old buildings remain intact. Commemoration Battle of Manila (1945) Historical Marker, Malaca√±ang Palace On 18 February 1995, the Memorare-Manila 1945 Foundation dedicated a memorial called the Shrine of Freedom to honor the memory of the over 100,000 civilians killed in the battle. It is also known as the Memorare Manila Monument and is located at Plaza de Santa Isabel in Intramuros. The inscription for the memorial was penned by National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin and reads: \\"This memorial is dedicated to all those innocent victims of war, many of whom went nameless and unknown to a common grave, or even never knew a grave at all, their bodies having been consumed by fire or crushed to dust beneath the rubble of ruins.\\" \\"Let this monument be the gravestone for each and every one of the over 100,000 men, women, children and infants killed in Manila during its battle of liberation, 3 February ‚Äì 3 March 1945.

Licensed to Irvine, California, United States, the station serves the Orange County area. The station is currently owned by Regents of the University of California. KUCI's studios are located by the Science Library and the Arts Computation Engineering Facility and remains the only independent radio station in Orange County. Background Originally a student-run pirate radio station in 1968 only reaching a few miles from the UCI campus, KUCI broadcast taped music from a dormitory on campus. The tapes were made by Richard Privette, and the broadcast equipment was assembled by an engineering student named Craig Will. Shortly after, there was a nightly live music and talk show called Unreal Radio, with Lee Sailer and Zack Zenor, from Sailer's dormitory room. KUCI became legal after it was forced to officially register with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) following a crack-down on illegal radio broadcasts in 1969. The legalization of the station was undertaken by Craig Will. 1969 was the first year that KUCI received funding from the Associated Students of UCI (ASUCI), which filed an application to register the station with the Federal Communications Commission. Will, unable to continue the process due to a wound from radiation testing and under the burden of his schoolwork, handed the project to Earl Arbuckle, who continued the work. On October 16, 1969, the FCC granted KUCI Program Test Authority to broadcast on 89.9 MHz. The studio at the time was inside a small closet in the Physical Science Building. Evening-only broadcasts featured records from the disc jockey's own collection. The first song ever played on KUCI was \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" by the Archies. In the spring of 1971, construction began on the third floor of UCI's Gateway Commons for studio and office space. By the fall of 1971, KUCI moved for the first time. At this time, the station's music library consisted of 400 records. In January 1975, KUCI's management decided to establish a 24-hour schedule. In 1981, KCRW, a station sharing the same frequency as KUCI, received permission from the FCC to relocate their antenna and boost their power. KUCI's signal was dampened to a few hundred yards. KUCI quickly applied for a new frequency, but the government lost the paperwork. After protests and petitions by staff, students, and community members, KUCI received permission to change their frequency to 88.9 fm, where it continues to broadcast. It shares this frequency with another low-power college station, KXLU, which broadcasts from Loyola Marymount University in West Los Angeles, California. Almost ten years later and after the filing of many applications, KUCI acquired the right to raise the power from 25 watts mono. On April 23, 1993, KUCI became a 200-watt stereo station and played \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" again to celebrate the event. In 1993, UC Irvine's management was ready to tear down Gateway Common's walls for earthquake retrofitting. In the summer of 1994, KUCI moved its entire operations to the temporary building called Humanities Annex, home to the Center for Gender Education. KUCI has benefited from its proximity to the Los Angeles music scene, with notable performances and visits from many up-and-coming artists such as X, Red Hot Chili Peppers, No Doubt, Social Distortion, Jack Johnson, and the Dead Milkmen. KUCI airs an extensive schedule of the UC Irvine Anteaters, including all of the men's basketball games and most of the women's basketball and baseball games.

In 1840, he introduced a beer that combined the crispness of lager with the paler hues of the English ale; this new style of beer became known as the Viennese style and was called Schwechater Lagerbier.Graham Lees, ‚ÄúAll About Beer,‚Äù excerpted in Beer Barons Beer Styles .

After several years of hand-to-mouth living, including a long stint as a waiter in a local beer hall, in 1780, Dreher leased a small brewery in Ober-Lanzendorf; in 1782, he leased another brewery, and acquired some fields.Dreher Family history, Accessed 30 July 2009 ] . In 1796, he purchased, for 19,000 Thalers, a brewery in Klein Schwechat, outside of Vienna, with and the Herberghaus (hostel). Dreher married (i) Maria Anna Huber, daughter of a surveyor, who had learned something of the brewing trade. The couple had no children, and when she died in 1803, he married (ii) Katherine Widter, 1786‚Äì1864, a miller's daughter from Speichm√ºhle near Petersdorf. They had four children: Clara, 1806‚Äì1885, who married Franz Aich (1803‚Äì1870), also from a well known family of brewers in Tyrnau; a daughter who died circa 1808; another daughter; and Anton Dreher (the elder), born 1810, married (i), Anna Wigrill (1816‚Äì1841), the daughter of a shipmaster and land owner from Krems and, after the death of his first wife, (ii) Ann Hersfeld, 1824‚Äì1884, daughter of an administrator for the family of Thurn-Taxis, in Regensburg. From the second marriage, his son and heir, Anton (1849‚Äì1921) was born. Anton Dreher (the younger) married Katherina, daughter of the master brewer Meichl of Simmering, to whom he had been apprenticed. They had 3 sons, Anton Eugen, Jen≈ë, and Theodore. Theodore was a racing and auto enthusiast, and died in 1914. Anton Eugen, the oldest son, inherited the Austrian concern in 1923, upon his father's death, but he himself died in 1925; his own son, Anton, had died in World War I, and his grandson, Oscar, died at the age of 10 years the following year. Anton Dreher also had an illegitimate son, the writer and editor Anton Breitner (March 18, 1858, in Vienna - May 30, 1928, in Mattsee). Jen≈ë Dreher, the youngest son of Anton Dreher, inherited the family's Hungarian concerns. Jen≈ë's daughter, Elizabeth died at the age of 17 from tuberculosis; Lilly Haggenmacher mourned for her daughter until her own death.  Education and career  When Franz Anton Dreher (the younger) died of marasmus in 1820, his ten-year-old son was too young to manage the brewing business. Dreher was apprenticed to the brewer Meichel, in Simmering and later undertook a study tour, a journeyman's tour, through Germany, where he studied at the Sedlmayr brewery in Munich, England, where he studied at Barclay and Perkins in London, and Scotland.Article \\"Dreher, Anton\\" in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayrischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 5 (1877), ab Seite 391.Wikisourc. Anton Dreher On April 1 1836, he started renting his mother's brewery and started to make pale malt using the English malting process he had learned about a few years before which he used to brew top-fermented \\"Kaiserbier\\". Using bottom-fermenting yeast he had received from his friend Gabriel Sedlmayr's Spaten brewery, he started brewing bottom- fermented beer during the winter, but lacking any cellars on his own, the beer had to be matured in the pub cellars. During the summer, he had to go back to brewing top-fermented beers. On May 27, 1839, he was able to buy the brewery outright from his mother for 24,000 Gulden. In 1841, instead of entrusting the correct storage and maturation of his beer to pub owners, he instead stored the beer under cold conditions by himself, using the cellars of the pub \\"zur Kohlkreunze\\" in Vienna's suburb F√ºnfhaus, his own house's cellars and a cellar that he rented from his a neighbor. In 1842 and 1843, he started building extensive cellars next to his brewery. This allowed him to drastically expand his brewing business, eventually culminating in the purchase of two breweries in Michelob and K≈ëb√°nya to better serve the Bohemian and Hungarian markets. He owned acres of land throughout Austria and Bohemia, and grew his own hops (at his brewing estate in Michelob) and barley, which allowed him to protect the business from the volatility of the hop and grain market at least to a certain extent. When he died suddenly on December 26, 1863, his fortune was estimated at 8 to 10 million Gulden.  Development of pale lager  Starting in 1836, Anton Dreher took over the brewery and developed the bottom-fermented beer ‚Äî Schwechater Lagerbier ‚Äî which he presented in 1840/1841. It was a new style of beer, methodically bottom fermented to produce a brew that was coppery reddish-brown in color. It required steady, cool temperature for maturation and storage, and this requirement gives the beer its name: lager (in German, Lager means storehouse or warehouse). Originally, he called the beer M√§rzen, or March beer. Although situated in Austria, Anton Dreher strictly kept to Bavarian brewing methods in his brewery and therefore only brewed beer in the winter months between October and April when natural temperatures allowed cool fermentation and the collection of ice for the lagering cellar. In this tradition, M√§rzen was the last beer brewed in a brewing season, sometimes to a greater strength. In 1858, Dreher's Lager won the gold medal for excellence at the Beer Exhibit in Vienna. On 26 November 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph I honoured Anton Dreher's work by visiting his brewery. At the International Exhibition in London 1862, Dreher presented four types of beer for which he received a bronze medal. In recognition of this success, Anton Dreher was made a Knight of the Imperial Austrian Order of Franz Joseph by the Emperor. The Danube river provided the water needed for unlimited beer and malt making. The attention turned to K≈ëb√°nya because of a beer made by Peter Schmidt, a brewer master from Pest who studied in Munich. Schmidt stored beer in his rock cellar in K≈ëb√°nya. The water in the wells, made by deep drilling technology, is perfectly suited for beer making; the cellars of Schmidt's brewery provided the steady cool temperature needed for maturation and storage. It was the ideal warehouse, or, in German Lager, for storing the beer. The surge of the K≈ëb√°nya beer production attracted Dreher's attention, in part because Schmidt's beer was competition for him. He visited Pest-Buda on several occasions between 1856 and 1860; by 1862 he was able to buy the K≈ëb√°nya Brewery Company. He purchased further plots of land and prepared for expansion, but died suddenly in 1863, leaving his 14-year-old son to implement the plans.  The brewery under the son's leadership  After his father's death in 1863, Anton Dreher continued the work on the brewing process. He started to export this beer first to the Netherlands, then to Triest (now Trieste), where it was known as Birra Dreher, and then to Germany.History, p. 3. In 1871, known as the winter without ice, Dreher constructed a cooling machine to process the beer. He continued to develop the brewery, the mechanization, and the fields, and by 1897 the brewery was producing 739.639 Hectoliters of beer, which was more than double the amount produced under his father in the company's most productive year. By 1900, Schwechat Brewery was the largest brewery in Europe The following year, the brewery produced 1.25 million Hectoliters, making it the most productive brewery in the world. By 1913, the brewery in Schwechat was united with brewery in Simmering, and the brewery in another suburb of Vienna, St. Marx, and known as The United Breweries of Schwechat, Simmering, and St. Marx: Dreher, Mautner, Meichle Incorporated.History of Schwechat Beer Production declined shrank during World War I, when over half of its employees were needed for military service. The Brewery facility in Schwechat was converted to a hospital, and the other breweries produced Kriegsbier (war beer), for distribution to the troops. = Awards = In 1867, Dreher's Kleinschwechater brewery presented its beers at the 1867 International Exposition in Paris. It built a restaurant in the park of the Expo's Austrian section which included two ice cellars to store the beer under optimal conditions. Using custom-built ice wagons that ensured a constant temperature of 4¬∞C, the brewery could transport 54 hectolitres of beer from Klein-Schwechat to Paris, a journey that took 5 days. The brewery was awarded a gold medal for the beers presented. In 1873, Anton Dreher Jr. was awarded an Honorary Diploma for his beers presented at the Vienna World's Fair. In 1878, he again won gold in Paris, 1879, again in Sydney, 1878, in Melbourne, and 1882, in Trieste.History. On 30 October 1873, Anton Dreher Jr. was made a Knight of the Imperial Austrian Order of Franz Joseph. In 1897, Dreher was promoted to a Knight Commander of the Imperial Austrian Order of Franz Joseph. In 1902, he became a member of the Austrian House of Lords and was made a Knight Second Class of the Order of the Iron Crown.Anton Dreher Jr., ca. 1900 = Brauhaus Dreher = The Dreher Brewery and Tavern played an important role in the Social Democrat movement of Vienna following World War I, also known as Red Vienna. In the middle of the 19th century, Anton Dreher senior had purchased two small, adjacent restaurants and combined them into one Gasthaus with a big garden. Drehers Etablissement opened on 25 December 1859 and was an immediate hit as a hot Beer Hall. It had not only the garden and the tavern, but also a restaurant and a dance hall. Between 1918 and 1933, it became the unofficial meeting place of Landstrasser Social Democrats of Vienna.Red Vienna, WebLexicon of Viennese Social Democracy Online, Accessed 30 July 2009, here The Dreher Etablissement', opened 1859.  Expansion to Hungary  Among his three sons, Anton Dreher Jr. entrusted Jen≈ë with the management of the K≈ëb√°nya brewery, which became a corporation in 1907 under the name \\"Dreher Antal K≈ëb√°nyai Serf≈ëzd√©je,\\" and was a market leader until World War I. The Dreher family business became a corporation in 1905 and the Hungarian company became independent of the mother company in 1907. Jen≈ë Dreher continued to buy shares of his competitors, Haggenmacher K≈ëb√°nya and Budafoki Rt., Barber and Klusemann Brewery and the First Hungarian Brewery Corporation (founded in 1867). When Anton Dreher died in 1921, his oldest son, Anton Eugen (b. 1871) took over the brewery business, but he died in 1925. The 12-year-old Oskar died in 1926, and with him the line of brewers. The Dreher Combine, which was merged from these two companies in 1923, also bought up the Royal Brewery Corporation of Kanizsa in 1928. As the result of the grand scale expansion, Dreher-Haggenmacher First Hungarian Brewery Corporation was launched in 1933, and acquired 70 percent of the market.Jen≈ë Dreher at the Horse races. He was a rider before he took over his father's business in Hungary. The two other K≈ëb√°nya Breweries - Polg√°r and the Municipal Brewery ‚Äì were left with only a quarter stake of the market. Dreher beer was exported to North and South America, western Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, where ever Germans, Austrians and Hungarians migrated, and became a worldwide brand name. After the death of his elder brother and his great nephew, Jen≈ë Dreher sold off the Austrian portion of the family business.  The Brewery after the Drehers  After the deaths of the Drehers, the Austrian side of the business was transformed into a consortium; the family Mautner-Markhof, which had been associated with the Drehers since the development of the crystallized malt, assumed direction of the consortium. In 1945, the main brewery was destroyed in World War II, and for the first time in over a century, no beer was produced by the company; eight months later, the brewery reopened, and production began again. Twenty years later, it joined with the Austrian Brewery, AG, and the Steirer brewery AG, to create the Brewery Union of Austria, AG. On the Hungarian side, the Dreher family fortune and business was nationalized by the new communist state; the Drehers left Hungary. In 1992, K≈ëb√°nyai S√∂rgy√°r was converted into a shareholding company; in 1993, it became a member of the South African Breweries (SAB). In 1997, the company acquired rights to the name Dreher, and became Dreher S√∂rgy√°rak Ltd (Dreher Breweries). The brewery exists today, and still produces Lager. In 2002, the South African Breweries merged with the Miller Brewing Company to create the SABMiller group, which is the second largest brewing company of the world, with brewing interests or distribution agreements in over 60 countries across six continents. SABMiller PLC is listed in the London stock exchange and the Johannesburg stock exchange, and its international brand portfolio includes such historical brands as Pilsner Urquell, Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft, and Castle Lager. In 2017, Dreher Breweries were sold by SABMiller PLC to Asahi Breweries.

Seismite formed by liquefaction of sediments during a Late Ordovician earthquake (northern Kentucky, USA). Paleoseismology looks at geologic sediments and rocks, for signs of ancient earthquakes. It is used to supplement seismic monitoring, for the calculation of seismic hazard. Paleoseismology is usually restricted to geologic regimes that have undergone continuous sediment creation for the last few thousand years, such as swamps, lakes, river beds and shorelines. In this typical example, a trench is dug in an active sedimentation regime. Evidence of thrust faulting can be seen in the walls of the trench. It becomes a matter of deducting the relative age of each fault, by cross-cutting patterns. The faults can be dated in absolute terms, if there is dateable carbon, or human artifacts. Many notable discoveries have been made using the techniques of paleoseismology. For example, there is a common misconception that having many smaller earthquakes can somehow 'relieve' a major fault such as the San Andreas Fault, and reduce the chance of a major earthquake. It is now known (using paleoseismology) that nearly all the movement of the fault takes place with extremely large earthquakes. All of these seismic events (with a moment magnitude of over 8), leave some sort of trace in the sedimentation record. Another famous example involves the megathrust earthquakes of the Pacific Northwest. It was thought for some time that there was low seismic hazard in the region because relatively few modern earthquakes have been recorded. It was thought that the Cascadia subduction zone was merely sliding in a benign manner. All of these comforting notions were shattered by paleoseismology studies showing evidence of extremely large earthquakes (the most recent being in 1700), along with historical tsunami records. In effect, the subduction zone under British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and far northern California, is perfectly normal, being extremely hazardous in the long term, with the capability of generating coastal tsunamis of several hundred feet in height at the coast. These are caused by the interface between the subducted sea floor stressing the overlaying coastal soils in compression. Periodically a slip will occur which causes the coastal portion to reduce in elevation and thrust toward the west, leading to tsunamis in the central and eastern north Pacific Ocean (with several hours of warning) and a reflux of water toward the coastal shore, with little time for residents to escape.

When the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) Government took power from Kenya African National Union (KANU) in 2003, Dr Murungaru was named Minister of Internal Security. He was later transferred to the Ministry of Transport in a cabinet reshuffle, following revelations of the Anglo Leasing Scandal. When President Mwai Kibaki reconstituted the cabinet following a humiliating defeat in the November 21, 2005 constitutional Referendum, he was dropped from the cabinet. He was a close ally of Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. Anglo Leasing Scandal Recently, Dr Murungaru has been embroiled in a conflict with the British Government following cancellation of his Visa to enter the United Kingdom, due to allegations of corruption in the Anglo-Leasing scandal. He has taken the British Government to court challenging the cancellation of his visa. He has hired prominent Kenyan lawyer Paul Muite and a group of British lawyers, Mr Rabinder Singh, a Queen's Counsel of Matrix Chambers, London, Mr Richard Stein, a senior partner in Leigh, Day and Company and Ms Tessa Hetherington, a junior counsel of Matrix to represent him. On November 23, 2005, President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya dissolved his cabinet following a humiliating defeat on a referendum on the proposed constitution of Kenya. The president and his key allies, including Murungaru were campaigning for a Yes vote on the constitution, which they lost, forcing the president to reconstitute his cabinet. =Fallout= On January 22, 2006, John Githongo named Murungaru as one of three top politicians (along with Kiraitu Murungi, former Justice Minister and present Energy Minister, and Finance Minister David Mwiraria) as being involved in a financial scam involving up to $600M Controversy re \\"scam\\" . On February 1, 2006, Finance Minister David Mwiraria announced that he was stepping down as a minister and a member of cabinet to pave way for investigation. The news were received with joy by many Kenyans, though some saw him as a scapegoat who has been sacrificed to protect a president whose support has been waning. On January 16, 2006, President Kibaki allowed anti- corruption chief Aaron Ringera to request Murungaru to declare and account for his wealth. Murungaru has since moved to court to prevent the Kenya Anti- Corruption Commission from investigating, saying fulfilling the commission's request would amount to self-incrimination. Vice President Moody Awori announced on February 2, 2006 that he would not step down despite being adversely mentioned in the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He has insisted that he is innocent, and that nothing short of due process will make him resign his post. He has criticized by many people for defending those involved in the scandal before Parliament. Court battles On February 17, 2006, the Kenya Anti- Corruption Commission (KACC) arraigned Dr. Murungaru in a Nairobi court charging him with failing to declare and account for his wealth. The Commission believed that Dr. Murungaru had become too rich too quickly and was keen to investigate the source of his wealth, especially in relation to the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He denied refusing to declare his wealth, and was released on a bond of KES 200,000. On December 1, 2006, the Kenyan High Court determined that KACC's notice to Murungaru was not carried out according to the laid down law which subsequently led to the High Court quashing KACC's case against Murungaru. The court did not however stop KACC from investigating Murungaru or anyone else for corruption but insisted that any orders issued by the Commission be done so in a legal manner. A society in Kenya under the banner of the Name and Shame Corruption Network (NASCON) held a demonstration in the streets of Nairobi to push for the resignation of more senior people in President Mwai Kibaki's administration. Key among them is civil service boss Francis Muthaura and Vice President Moody Awori. In what was considered an upset, Murungaru was defeated by a comparatively obscure candidate in the Party of National Unity's primary elections for its parliamentary candidates in November 2007.\\"Upset in Kenyan primaries\\" , Sapa (News24), November 18, 2007.

Due to protracted development, the project was not completed until after the war, and was cancelled after flight testing, when the advent of jet aircraft was imminent. Design and development The CA-15 after crash landing at RAAF Point Cook As the CAC Boomerang became more and more obsolete against the Mitsubishi A6M Zero by 1942, Sir Lawrence Wackett proposed designing a new high performance fighter from scratch with Fred David as the head of an in-house CAC design team. During 1943, following the success of CAC and chief designer Fred David, in rapidly designing and mass-producing the small Boomerang fighter for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), CAC began design work on a fully fledged interceptor and bomber escort. In June 1943 the Royal Australian Air Force approved the design concept proposal and issued design specification 2/43 for work to commence Although the CA-15 bore a superficial resemblance to the North American P-51 Mustang,Air Enthusiast October 1972, p. 179. the CAC design was not based directly on the American aircraft and had quite different performance objectives and dimensions. For instance, David had been impressed by assessments of captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190sRoss 1995, p. 321. and intended using a radial engine rather than the inline engines used in fighters like the Mustang. In fact, development of the CA-15 was slowed by a recommendation from CAC head Lawrence Wackett, that the company build Mustangs under licence, rather than bear the cost of developing a unique design. By the later stages of its development, it was believed that the CA-15 would have capabilities enabling it to replace the P-51. At first, the CAC designers planned to use the 2,300 hp (1,715 kW) radial Pratt & Whitney R-2800, with a turbocharger. However, that engine became unavailable, causing further delays in development, and it was decided to fit an in-line Rolls-Royce Griffon Mk 61 (2,035 hp/1,517 kW). Engines for a prototype were leased from Rolls-Royce. It was intended that any production engines would have a three-stage supercharger. Operational history The CA-15, piloted by Flt Lt J.A.L. Archer, over Melbourne, photographed from the rear turret of an Avro Lincoln bomber Development was further slowed by the end of the war, with the prototype flying for the first time on 4 March 1946, and was flown by CAC test pilot Jim Schofield, who also flew the first Australian built P-51. The prototype was assigned RAAF serial number A62-1001. According to aviation historian Darren Crick, it achieved a calibrated level flight speed of 448 mph (721 km/h) at 26,400 ft (8,046 m). Test flights came to an abrupt ending when Flt Lt J. A. L. Archer suffered a hydraulic failure (later found to be a leaking ground test gauge) on approach to Point Cook on 10 December 1946, which left him no choice but to orbit and burn off fuel. The main gear was only halfway down and unable to be retracted or lowered any further but the tail wheel was down and locked. On landing, the tail wheel struck the airstrip first causing the aircraft to porpoise and finally, the airscoop dug in. The aircraft settled back on the fuselage and skidded to a stop, heavily damaged.Crick 2003 After repairs at CAC, the aircraft was returned to ARDU in 1948. Archer reportedly achieved a speed of 502.2 mph (803 km/h) over Melbourne, after levelling out of a dive of 4,000 ft (1,200 m), on 25 May 1948. By this time, however, it was clear that jet aircraft had far greater potential and no further examples of the CA-15 were built. The prototype was scrapped in 1950, and the engines were returned to Rolls-Royce.

It is a sluggish and heavy warbler with a short tail, preferring to spend most of its time on or near the ground, except when singing. Description Adult Kentucky warblers are mostly an olive-green in color on their back and nape, and a brilliant yellow below from their throat to their belly. They have a small tinge of black on their crown, and a large black mask with a yellow pattern that runs from the beak and encircles the eyes, resembling a pair of spectacles. Female Kentucky warblers have slightly less black on the sides of their head, and immature birds may have almost no black at all. Measurements: * Length: 5.1 in (13 cm) * Weight: 0.5-0.5 oz (13-14 g) * Wingspan: 7.9-8.7 in (20-22 cm) Range The Kentucky warbler is a scarce bird with a large range, frequenting moist deciduous forests. It is migratory, spending summer in the central and eastern United States, often ranging as far north as Wisconsin to Pennsylvania. Come fall and winter the Kentucky warbler will migrate back to the Yucat√°n Peninsula and the many islands of the Caribbean, flying non-stop across the Gulf of Mexico. In 2007, the Kentucky warbler was seen as far west as Farmington, New Mexico. Nesting Kentucky warblers nest on the ground hidden at the base of a shrub or in a patch of weeds in an area of ample vegetation. The female will lay between 3 and 6 eggs, which are white or cream-colored and speckled with brown. Incubation is done by the female only, and lasts for about 12 days. The young Kentucky warblers usually leave the nest about 10 days after hatching.

It occupies the lower levels of a series of office blocks and hotels, comprising several parts: Marco Polo Hotels, Ocean Terminal, Ocean Centre, the Gateway and the Pacific Club Kowloon. The complex is located along the west side of Canton Road, stretching from Star House and the Star Ferry Pier in the south to China Hong Kong City in the north. It is the largest shopping center in the West Kowloon District of Hong Kong and one of the Hong Kong shopping malls. It is a property of jiulongcang group. The mall covers an area of 2 million square feet, including about 50 restaurants, 2 large cinemas, 3 hotels and about 700 retail stores. The office building of Haigang city covers an area of 4.4 million square feet. The rest covers an area of 6million square feet, including three high-level hotels, 500 room service housing, a private club and more than 2000 parking spaces. The harbour city is a building group of four parts, which are the sea building, Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel, Ocean Center and Hong Kong Weiwei building. The port city is developed by jiucang and is rebuilt by stages. The earliest part of the sea building was completed in 1966, with cruise terminals attached. The entire complex took shape in the 1980s. Harbour city is a large building complex in Hong Kong, from Tianxing wharf, Tsim Sha Tsui to the South and to Zhonggang city in the north. As it is the largest shopping center in Hong Kong, it has become one of the tourist attractions. Every Saturday and Sunday, [1] will have more than 150 thousand people to enter the shopping mall, including local residents, foreign tourists and free agents in mainland China. On average, more than 60000 people work in the office building. The mall has a small venue for performance and exhibition, and the mall also hosts \\"music in the city\\", which is a Saturday and Sunday invitation to band or music in the mall. The harbor city will have a strong festival atmosphere in the square layout on Christmas and Lunar New Year festivals, and the layout will be focused on the entrance of Tianxing wharf near Tsimshatsui. The five flagpoles in front of the south entrance of the port city are the hot spots of the public gathering and folk activities. At present, the flags of the five flags are jiulongcang, Haigang City, jiucang Telecom, Hong Kong cable television and sky star small ship. The highest of the flagpoles is jiulongcang group, and the other four are its subsidiaries. History The centre is built on the site of the Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown, one of colonial Hong Kong's original commercial wharfage and dockside warehousing complexes. Harbour City is still owned by The Wharf (Holdings) Limited (), or Wharf () in short, a company founded in 1886 in Hong Kong. As its name suggests, the company's original business was in running wharfage and dockside warehousing, and it was originally known as The Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company, Limited and founded by Sir Paul Chater. The company adopted its current name in 1986. The current major holder of the company is Wheelock & Co., which was formed in 1886 to operate the godown but has since grown to be a major commercial force in Hong Kong. Features The mall features many branded boutiques, such as Cerruti 1881, Gieves & Hawkes, Kent & Curwen, D'Urban, MCM (Mode Creation Munich), Louis Vuitton, Salvatore Ferragamo, Shiatzy Chen, Prada, Yves Saint Laurent, Polo Ralph Lauren, Versace, Burberry, and Hugo Boss. The mall also has two cinemas at both ends, the Grand Ocean and the Grand Gateway; both are operated by Golden Harvest. It is home to the largest Toys \\"R\\" Us location in Hong Kong, and there is a large Lane Crawford in the Ocean Terminal portion of the mall. The outlet includes a new look and new features compared to its other stores by the group. The 3rd floor of Ocean Terminal was converted in the early 2000s into LCX, a collection of retailers targeted at younger demographics. c!ty'super, is located in Harbour City.

These birds are sluggish and heavy warblers, preferring to spend most of their time on, or near the ground, except when singing. Bruce Horsfall The MacGillivray's warbler was named by John James Audubon in honor of Scottish ornithologist William MacGillivray, although the proper credit to its discovery goes to John Kirk Townsend. The specific name was given in honor of William Fraser Tolmie. Adult MacGillivray's warblers are an olive-green color on their upperparts and dull yellow below. Males have black heads and breasts, while females and immature birds have drab light gray heads; both males and females have broken white eye-rings. The song is a series of repeated two-note phrases, gradually increasing in volume, ending with two single notes: jeeter jeeter jeeter JEETER JEETER jeet jeet. MacGillivray's warblers are very similar to their eastern counterpart, the mourning warbler, the primary difference between the two species being the mourning warbler's lack of an eye-ring. Measurements: * Length: 3.9-5.9 in (10-15 cm) * Weight: 0.3-0.5 oz (9-13 g) * Wingspan: 7.5 in (19 cm) MacGillivray's warblers are migratory and spend their summers in temperate forests in the western United States, and in boreal forests of west Canada.

The company's central offices are located in Sapporo. Company History * Royce' was first established in July 1983, with a total capital of ¬•10.0 million. Royce's first head office building was located in Hokkaid≈ç, about 500 miles north of Tokyo. By November of that year, Royce' began to produce their first chocolates. * The company's first two years saw rather slow growth as it integrated into the Japanese economy. It was not until the 1990s that Royce' would become a significant player in the Asian candy industry. In September 1985, Royce's capital had increased to ¬•30.5 million. * In September 1989, Royce' was finally able to add a chocolate molding line, allowing the company to further compete with other market brands. * The first Royce' shop was established in May 1993. It was named the \\"Higashi Naebo Main Shop\\". This shop, like others to come, would sell Royce' chocolates, as well as company and area-related souvenirs. Royce' cookie production also began in 1993. * 1994 and 1995 saw major store expansion for Royce' in Japan. Outlets were established in Hiragishi, Asabu and Kotoni. * A delivery center was established in 1996, as well as the \\"Nama\\" chocolate brand. The delivery center was served by a fleet of semi-trucks that took Royce's products to clients. * March 1997 was a relatively important year for Royce', as the company opened a sales shop in downtown Sapporo, thereby establishing its first contact with the city where they are currently headquartered. The Royce' sales shop was established inside a Mitsukoshi department store. * In June of the same year, with the Sapporo public already familiar with the Royce' brand, the company moved their headquarters to Sapporo, in the Higashi-ku district. The Truffle chocolate brand was later established, and a new distribution center was inaugurated in November. Royce' began selling its chocolates in Hokkaid≈ç area airports, including Chitose Airport. * By June 1998, Royce' had established an internet web page, using a computer system named LAN. The next month, the company announced that its capital had risen to slightly more than twice the amount from the previous announcement, or to ¬•61 million. Another store was opened, this time in a shopping center. * A new manufacturing facility was inaugurated by Royce', in July 1999, at Futomi. Another store opened, this one located at the Sapporo Odori. Just one month before, Royce' had inaugurated a store at their Sapporo factory, naming it the \\"Sapporo Factory Shopping Center\\". * In September of that same year, the company moved its headquarters for the third time, but stayed within Sapporo. * In December 2000, Royce' launched an online store. By that year, the company had begun an advertisement campaign on All Nippon Airways' inflight magazine. * Three more Sapporo stores were inaugurated in July 2001, each located inside well known Japanese department stores. * Yet another store inside a Sapporo department store, the Robinson Department Store Sapporo branch, was opened in April 2002. By then, Royce' also began to sell bakery products. * Another shop is opened in Busan, feb. 2012 Diversification in other business In 2005, Royce' branched out into other businesses, such as selling other types of foods and drinking water, food and beverage processing machines, liquor sales (importing and exporting), coffee brands, restaurant management, arts and craft sales, and insurance sales.

It operates at near-ambient temperatures and differs significantly from cryogenic distillation techniques of gas separation. Specific adsorbent materials (e.g., zeolites, activated carbon, molecular sieves, etc.) are used as a trap, preferentially adsorbing the target gas species at high pressure. The process then swings to low pressure to desorb the adsorbed material. Process thumblink=Animation of pressure swing adsorption, (1) and (2) showing alternating adsorption and desorption { !I compressed air input rowspan=\\"3\\" width=\\"3em\\" !A adsorption - !O oxygen output !D desorption - !E exhaust } Pressure swing adsorption processes utilize the fact that under high pressure, gases tend to be attracted to solid surfaces, or \\"adsorbed\\". The higher the pressure, the more gas is adsorbed. When the pressure is reduced, the gas is released, or desorbed. PSA processes can be used to separate gases in a mixture because different gases tend to be attracted to different solid surfaces more or less strongly. If a gas mixture such as air is passed under pressure through a vessel containing an adsorbent bed of zeolite that attracts nitrogen more strongly than oxygen, part or all of the nitrogen will stay in the bed, and the gas exiting the vessel will be richer in oxygen than the mixture entering. When the bed reaches the end of its capacity to adsorb nitrogen, it can be regenerated by reducing the pressure, thus releasing the adsorbed nitrogen. It is then ready for another cycle of producing oxygen- enriched air. This is the process used in medical oxygen concentrators used by emphysema patients and others requiring oxygen-enriched air for breathing. Using two adsorbent vessels allows near-continuous production of the target gas. It also permits so-called pressure equalisation, where the gas leaving the vessel being depressurised is used to partially pressurise the second vessel. This results in significant energy savings, and is common industrial practice. Adsorbents Aside from their ability to discriminate between different gases, adsorbents for PSA systems are usually very porous materials chosen because of their large specific surface areas. Typical adsorbents are activated carbon, silica gel, alumina, resin and zeolite. Though the gas adsorbed on these surfaces may consist of a layer only one or at most a few molecules thick, surface areas of several hundred square meters per gram enable the adsorption of a significant portion of the adsorbent's weight in gas. In addition to their selectivity for different gases, zeolites and some types of activated carbon called carbon molecular sieves may utilize their molecular sieve characteristics to exclude some gas molecules from their structure based on the size of the molecules, thereby restricting the ability of the larger molecules to be adsorbed. Applications Gas separator membrane skid used in landfill gas utilization process Aside from its use to supply medical oxygen, or as a substitute for bulk cryogenic or compressed- cylinder storage, which is the primary oxygen source for any hospital, PSA has numerous other uses. One of the primary applications of PSA is in the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the final step in the large-scale commercial synthesis of hydrogen (H2) for use in oil refineries and in the production of ammonia (NH3). Refineries often use PSA technology in the removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from hydrogen feed and recycle streams of hydrotreating and hydrocracking units. Another application of PSA is the separation of carbon dioxide from biogas to increase the methane (CH4) ratio. Through PSA the biogas can be upgraded to a quality similar to natural gas. This includes a process in landfill gas utilization to upgrade landfill gas to utility-grade high purity methane gas to be sold as natural gas. PSA is also used in:- * Hypoxic air fire prevention systems to produce air with a low oxygen content. * On purpose propylene plants via propane dehydrogenation. They consist of a selective medium for the preferred adsorption of methane and ethane over hydrogen. * Industrial nitrogen generator units which employ the PSA technique produce high purity nitrogen gas (up to 99.9995%) from a supply of compressed air. But such PSA are more fitted to supply intermediate ranges of purity and flows. Capacities of such units are given in Nm¬≥/h, normal cubic meters per hour, one Nm¬≥/h being equivalent to 1000 liters per hour under any of several standard conditions of temperature, pressure, and humidity. ** for nitrogen : from 100 Nm¬≥/h at 99.9% purity, to 9000 Nm¬≥/h at 97% purity ; ** for oxygen : up to 1500 Nm¬≥/h with a purity between 88% and 93%. Research is currently underway for PSA to capture CO2 in large quantities from coal-fired power plants prior to geosequestration, in order to reduce greenhouse gas production from these plants.http://www.co2crc.com.au PSA has also been discussed as a future alternative to the non-regenerable sorbent technology used in space suit Primary Life Support Systems, in order to save weight and extend the operating time of the suit. Variations of PSA technology =Double Stage PSA= (DS-PSA, sometimes referred to as Dual Step PSA). With this variation of PSA developed for use in Laboratory Nitrogen Generators generation of nitrogen gas is divided into two steps: in the first step, the compressed air is forced to pass through a carbon molecular sieve to produce nitrogen at a purity of approximately 98%; in the second step this nitrogen is forced to pass into a second carbon molecular sieve and the nitrogen gas reaches a final purity up to 99.999%. The purge gas from the second step is recycled and partially used as feed gas in the first step. In addition, the purge process is supported by active evacuation for better performance in the next cycle. The goals of both of these changes is to improve efficiency over a conventional PSA process. The DS-PSA is also applied to up levels oxygen concentration in this case a zeolite aluminum silica based adsorb Nitrogen in the first stage focusing Oxygen 95%, and in the second stage the molecular sieve carbon-based adsorbs the residual nitrogen in a reverse cycle, concentrating to 99% oxygen. =Rapid PSA= Rapid pressure swing adsorption or RPSA is frequently used in portable oxygen concentrators. It allows a significant reduction in the size of the adsorbent bed when high purity is not essential and feed gas can be discarded. It works by quickly cycling the pressure while alternately venting opposite ends of the column at the same rate. This means that unadsorbed gases progress along the column much faster and are vented at the distal end, while adsorbed gases do not get the chance to progress and are vented at the proximal end. =Vacuum swing adsorption= Vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) segregates certain gases from a gaseous mixture at near ambient pressure; the process then swings to a vacuum to regenerate the adsorbent material. VSA differs from other PSA techniques because it operates at near-ambient temperatures and pressures. VSA typically draws the gas through the separation process with a vacuum. For oxygen and nitrogen VSA systems, the vacuum is typically generated by a blower. Hybrid Vacuum Pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) systems also exist. VPSA systems apply pressurized gas to the separation process and also apply a vacuum to the purge gas. VPSA systems, like one of the portable oxygen concentrators, are among the most efficient systems, measured on customary industry indices, such as recovery (product gas out/product gas in), productivity (product gas out/mass of sieve material). Generally, higher recovery leads to a smaller compressor, blower, or other compressed gas or vacuum source and lower power consumption. Higher productivity leads to smaller sieve beds. The consumer will most likely consider indices which have a more directly measurable difference in the overall system, like the amount of product gas divided by the system weight and size, the system initial and maintenance costs, the system power consumption or other operational costs, and reliability.

She played Nurse Tania Livingston in The Young Doctors and Sandra \\"Pixie\\" Mason in Prisoner. Early career Before acting, McBurney started a successful career as a model employed by June Dally- Watkins. One of her first acting roles was in late 1969, in a supporting role in Peter Weir's short movie Michael, one of three short movies released under the title Three to Go. It followed by small parts in ABC TV-plays and guest roles in other TV series. Her first leading role was in 1972 as Ella Belairs in ABC's adaption of The Cousin from Fiji, based on a novel by Norman Lindsay. Another early and memorable role was as Aldith in Seven Little Australians. Television soap operas In late 1973, McBurney was cast in the role of key new character Marilyn McDonald in Number 96 but before any of her scenes had gone to air and with about 30 scenes in the can she had to withdraw from the role due to illness. This left her replacement, Frances Hargreaves, to reshoot all of McBurney's scenes. McBurney then went into the ongoing role of plain- Jane secretary Jane Fowler in The Box in late 1975, and later played the brief role of Jodi in Number 96. Subsequently, she became immensely popular playing the part of nurse Tania Livingston in The Young Doctors. She played the role from 1977 until the series ended in 1982. She followed this with another popular character, that of breezy romantic Sandra \\"Pixie\\" Mason in Prisoner. She played Pixie on a recurring basis from 1983‚Äì85. In later years she appeared in a few episodes of Always Greener. McBurney was also famous for her voice-over work and also starring in commercials, in particular a very cheeky, controversial ad from the 1980s for Palmolive Gold, in which she features in a bed with fellow The Young Doctors actor Peter Bensley. McBurney leaves a cake of soap under his pillow, which led to the famous jingle and saying \\"Don't wait to be told\\".

In air force terminology the aiming point (or A.P.) refers to holding the intersection of the cross hairs on a bombsight when fixed at a specific target. An indirect fire aiming point provides a point of angular reference to aim a gun in the required horizontal direction ‚Äì azimuth. Until the 1980s aiming points were essential for indirect fire artillery. They are also used by mortars and machine guns firing indirectly. An essential requirement of an aiming point is that it be at a sufficient distance from the gun using it. The reason for this is that, while firing, guns, particularly towed guns, move back a short distance ‚Äì perhaps a foot, as their spades embed and may move more in soft ground. When they traverse their barrels their sights also move because they are not at the point of pivot. All this means that if the aiming point is too close then the angle to the aiming point changes. This aims the guns off-target, possibly up to several hundred meters. For gun-laying purposes a distance of a few kilometers from gun to aiming point is sufficient. An aiming point would be a sharply defined and easily distinguished feature, such the edge of an obvious building. However, this presents problems in featureless areas, in bad visibility or at night and putting lights on distant aiming points is seldom practical. Therefore, methods of simulating a distant aiming point are required. History The earliest form of aiming point was a pair of aiming posts for each gun, almost in line with one another when viewed through the gun's sight, and placed about 50 meters from the gun. There were at least two ways of using these, but the simplest is to aim the sight midway between them. Before the First World War the French introduced the collimateur. During that war the British introduced their first parallescope, which was a horizontal mirror placed a few feet from the gun; the layer aimed his sight at its reflection. In the 1950s the parallescope was replaced by the prism parallescope that was more robust and easily positioned. In the 1970s the US introduced a modern version of the French device and called it a collimator. In the same period infra-red beacons had some very limited use. In some special circumstances, such as when only one round or salvo was going to be fired (e.g. by nuclear artillery or a multiple rocket launcher), a director or aiming circle about 100 meters away could be used as an aiming point. Related matters Originally, when indirect fire was introduced, an aiming point (AP) was used as a quick means of orienting the guns by ordering an angle to the AP for all guns to use. Other aiming points were used for aiming while firing, initially called ‚Äòsupplementary aiming points‚Äô were given the name ‚ÄòGun Aiming Points‚Äô (GAP). Many armies required that each gun recorded several GAPs, some mounted recording plates on their guns where the GAP angles were written, and some had regulations giving the priority order for the use of different types of GAP. In the 1980s the US Multi-Launch Rocket System entered US service, this did not use GAPs because it had a gyroscopic orientation system and did not need external reference points or orientation. During the 1990s similar systems were adopted by M109 Paladin, AS90 and Panzerhaubitze 2000, and subsequently they were adopted for towed guns, notably UK‚Äôs 105mm L118 Light Guns.

He is the winner among others of 8 Compasso d‚ÄôOro and prestigious architecture awards including the Medaglia d‚ÄôOro conferred on him by the President of the Italian Republic.Driven To Write, Dec 17, 2014 http://driventowrite.com/2014/12/17/designer-mario- bellini/ Like many other Italian architects, his activities range from architecture and urban planning to product and furniture design.  Design His career as a product and furniture designer began in 1963, and from 1963 to 1991 he was chief design consultant for Olivetti. For many years he designed furnishing products and systems for B&B; Italia and Cassina, TV sets for Brionvega, and hi-fi systems, headphones and electric organs for Yamaha. For five years he worked as an automobile design consultant with Renault. In 1972 he was commissioned to design and build the prototype of the Kar-a-Sutra mobile environment for the exhibition ‚ÄúItaly: the New Domestic Landscape‚Äù at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He has also designed for Fiat and Lancia (notably the interior of the 1980 Lancia Trevi), lamps for Artemide, Erco and Flos, and office furniture for Vitra. Other firms for whom he has designed and/or continues to design products include (in Italy) Acerbis, Bras, Driade, Candy, Castilia, Flou, Kartell, Marcatr√®, Meritalia, Natuzzi and Poltrona Frau; (in Belgium) Ideal Standard; (in Germany) Lamy and Rosenthal; (in Japan) Fuji and Zojirushi; and (in the USA) Heller. His early international success grew rapidly during the first two decades, especially in the design sector, and reached its peak in 1987 with a personal retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art of New York. At the time the museum already included 25 of his works in its Permanent Collection, including a remarkable set of Olivetti machines as well as the furniture for B&B; and Cassina - such as the famous \\"Cab\\" chair - and the innovative office chairs designed for Vitra. MBA's headquarters of 1,500 square metres in Milan were designed by Mario Bellini himself in the early 1990s, and today an average of 30 to 35 architects. In 1999, MBA obtained ISO 9001 quality certification. Architecture Since the ‚Äò80s, he has been increasingly successful in the field of architecture in Europe, Japan, the United States, Australia and the Arab Emirates.

This redundancy is a safety measure in case one of the steering mechanisms that control the ship's rudder fails. A helmsman or helm is a person who steers a ship, sailboat, submarine, other type of maritime vessel, or spacecraft. The rank and seniority of the helmsman may vary: on small vessels such as fishing vessels and yachts, the functions of the helmsman are combined with that of the skipper; on larger vessels, there is a separate officer of the watch who is responsible for the safe navigation of the ship and gives orders to the helmsman, who physically steers the ship in accordance with those orders. In the merchant navy, the person at the helm is usually an able seaman, particularly during ship arrivals, departures, and while maneuvering in restricted waters or other conditions requiring precise steering. An ordinary seaman is commonly restricted to steering in open waters. Moreover, military ships may have a seaman or quartermaster at the helm. A professional helmsman maintains a steady course, properly executes all rudder orders, and communicates to the officer on the bridge using navigational terms relating to ship's heading and steering. A helmsman relies upon visual references, a magnetic and gyrocompass, and a rudder angle indicator to steer a steady course. The mate or other officer on the bridge directs the helmsman aboard merchant or navy ships. Clear and exact communication between the helmsman and officer on the bridge is essential to safe navigation and ship handling. Subsequently, a set of standard steering commands, responses by the helmsman, and acknowledgment by the conning officer are widely recognized in the maritime industry. The helmsman repeats any verbal commands to demonstrate that the command is heard and understood. The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) requires that a helmsman be able to understand and respond to helm orders in English. The proliferation of autopilot systems and the increased computerization of operations on a ship's bridge lessen the need for helmsmen standing watch in open waters. Helm commands Helm orders or commands fall into two categories: rudder commands and heading commands. A rudder command dictates changing the angle of the rudder, which is a single-event action. Whereas steering a heading is a comparatively long event and will require ongoing or continuous rudder adjustments. The following are helm orders used in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard: Rudder *Midships (Bring rudder angle to 0 degrees) *Check your swing (Counter steer to stop the movement or swing of the ship's bow) *Hard rudder (Used infrequently, such as emergencies, when maximum rudder is required) *Left or right standard rudder (~20 degrees. Varies per ship) *Shift your rudder (Steer the same number of degrees but opposite rudder angle) Heading *Steady as she goes (Steer as needed to continue current heading) *Steady on a course (Steer as needed to bring ship on desired course) Acquired skills Navy sailors at the helm of an aircraft carrier in December 2001. Steering a ship effectively requires skills gained through training and experience. An expert helmsman has a keen sense of how a particular ship will respond to the helm or how different sea conditions impact steering. For instance, experience teaches a helmsman the ability to correct the rudder in advance of a ship substantially falling off course. This requires the capacity to anticipate the delay between when the helm is applied and when the ship responds to the rudder. Similarly, a skilled helmsman will avoid overcompensating for a ship's movement caused by local conditions, such as wind, swells, currents, or rough seas. =Ship simulators= A ship bridge simulator with 3-D graphics creates scenarios with realistic sights and sounds to train mariners in ship handling. Computer-based ship simulators provide a training environment for learning skills to steer a ship. Training can be programmed to replicate a variety of ship sizes and environmental conditions. Scenarios depicted in 3-D graphics range from making course corrections in open waters to maneuvering in port, rivers, or other shallow waters. Cost compared to a real vessel is low. Mariners learn responses to dangerous situations, such as steering failure, in the safety of a virtual environment. Land-based ship simulators may feature a full-scale replica of a steering stand with a ship's wheel. Such simulators incorporate magnetic and gyro compasses (or repeaters) for steering. Moreover, a rudder angle indicator that responds appropriately to the helm is part of the configuration. However technology also allows for a multitude of smaller workstations in a classroom setting. Administrators network student workstations so that the instructor can launch individual scenarios at each station. Computer models are used to accurately simulate conditions such as wind, seas, and currents. Moreover, shallow-water effects or other hydrodynamic forces, such as ships passing close to each other, can also be depicted. A computer application records training sessions, complete with voice commands issued by the instructor which are received by the students via a headset. =On the job training= Underway replenishment during which an oil tanker refuels ships at sea demands that the helmsman steer an extremely precise course. On-the-job training at sea is critical to a helmsman developing ability to \\"sense\\" or anticipate how a ship will respond in different conditions. The experienced helmsman uses measured responses to sea conditions, even when encountering heavy weather that may cause a ship to pitch and roll as it pounds its way through oncoming waves. Subsequently, the helmsman learns to relax and take into account the vessel's natural rhythm in order to avoid oversteering whatever the maritime environment. Consequently, more accurate steering is attained with less rudder. Applying the minimal rudder required to steer a course reduces drag of the ship, thereby favorably impacting the ship's speed and operating costs. One of the helmsman's most important duties is steering a ship in a harbor or seaport when reduced speeds slow a ship's response to the rudder. For it is during ship arrivals and departures, when most ship collisions or groundings occur. Clear communication, then, between the officer of the bridge and the helmsman is essential for safe operations. The officer or harbor pilot relies upon the helmsman to flawlessly execute steering commands to avoid a variety of hazards, including man-made obstacles, land formations, grounding in shallow waters, and the threat of collision with other vessels. In addition, powerful sea tides and river currents encountered in seaports heighten navigation dangers, as a ship's ability to stop is severely limited. Relieving the helm Helmsmen of merchant and military ships that are underway stand watch at the helm for a set period of time before being relieved by another watchstander. The person being relieved will complete any course change or other critical maneuver that is in progress before handing over the helm. Merchant Vessels Helmsman on the bridge of a container ship on river trip. The helmsman steers to instruction of the pilot, under the captain's control. The helmsman handing over the helm will inform the relief helmsman of any rudder commands in place and pertinent conditions. \\"Steering 180. We have oncoming traffic two points on the starboard\\" for example. In addition, the current helmsman should inform the relief if there are any peculiarities affecting steerage. Similarly, the helmsman will also point out if he or she is steering on a landmark, range, or navigational light. The relief helmsman is obligated to repeat the course being steered or other rudder command in order to demonstrate an understanding of the situation at the helm. On merchant ships, it is taught at the various maritime academies that the proper way to relieve the helm is for the helmsman being relieved to call out loudly the ship's course per gyro, course per standard magnetic compass, steering mode, rudder angle, and the pump the vessel is steering off of. The relief helmsman will then take the helm and repeat all the information to ensure that he/she knows what to steer while on watch. An example of this would be: Helmsman: \\"Helm is being relieved... steering two-four-eight per gyro, checking two-four-five per standard. Helm is in hand, rudder amidships, steering off the port pump.\\" Relief: \\"Helm has been relieved... steering two-four-eight per gyro, checking two-four-five per standard. Helm is in hand, rudder amidships, steering off the port pump.\\" The officer on watch will usually reply with \\"very well.\\" See also *Coxswain *Seafarer's professions and ranks *Tiller orders, e.g. \\"Starboard helm\\" was used to turn to left Notes References *\\"Is it a bug, or is it a feature?

Despite the name, they are not true lice (which are insects), but rather are related to the skeleton shrimp, most species of which are found in shallower waters. Whale lice are external parasites, found in skin lesions, genital folds, nostrils and eyes of marine mammals of the order Cetacea. These include not only whales but also dolphins and porpoises. Appearance The body of a whale louse is distinctly flat and considerably reduced at the rear. Its legs, especially the back three pairs of legs, have developed into claw-like protuberances with which it clings to its host. Its length ranges from depending on the species. Life cycle Most species of whale lice are associated with a single species of whale. They remain with their host throughout their development and do not experience a free-swimming phase. Although the relationship between a specific species of whale louse and a specific species of whale is more pronounced with baleen whales than with toothed whales, almost every species of whale has a louse species that is unique to it. With the sperm whale, the parasitic relationship is sex- specific. The whale louse Cyamus catodontis lives exclusively on the skin of the male, while Neocyamus physeteris is found only on females and calves. Cited in: Whale lice attach themselves to the host body in places that protect them from water currents, so they can be found in natural body openings and in wounds; with baleen whales they are found primarily on the head and in the ventral pleats. Around 7,500 whale lice live on a single whale. With some species of whale lice, whale barnacle infestations play an important role. On the right whale, the parasites live mainly on callosities (raised callus-like patches of skin on the whales' heads). The clusters of white lice contrast with the dark skin of the whale, and help researchers identify individual whales because of the lice clusters' unique shapes. The lice predominantly eat algae that settle on the host's body. They usually feed off the flaking skin of the host and frequent wounds or open areas. They cause minor skin damage, but this does not lead to significant illness. The development of the whale louse is closely connected with the life pattern of whales. The distribution of various lice species reflects migratory patterns.

Above: a manuscript page in Sanskrit, Devanagari script. The Prashnopanishad (, ) is an ancient Sanskrit text, embedded inside Atharva Veda, ascribed to Pippalada sakha of Vedic scholars. It is a Mukhya (primary) Upanishad, and is listed as number 4 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads of Hinduism. The Prashna Upanishad contains six Prashna (questions), and each is a chapter with a discussion of answers.Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 378-390 The chapters end with the phrase, prasnaprativakanam, which literally means, \\"thus ends the answer to the question\\". In some manuscripts discovered in India, the Upanishad is divided into three Adhyayas (chapters) with a total of six Kandikas (‡§ï‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ, short sections).Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 119-141 The first three questions are profound metaphysical questions but, states Eduard Roer, do not contain any defined, philosophical answers, are mostly embellished mythology and symbolism. The fourth section, in contrast, contains substantial philosophy. The last two sections discuss the symbol Om and Moksha concept. Roer as well as Weber suggest that the last two Prashnas may be spurious, later age insertion into the original Upanishad.Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 138 with footnote 1 Prashna Upanishad is notable for its structure and sociological insights into the education process in ancient India.Charles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), Archive of Prashna Upanishad, pages 46-51, 115-118 The Upanishad is also known as the Prashnopanishad (, ). In some historic Indian literature and commentaries, it is also called Shat Prasna Upanishad. Etymology Prashna (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§®) literally means, in modern usage, \\"question, query, inquiry\\".prazna Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon In ancient and medieval era Indian texts, the word had two additional context-dependent meanings: \\"task, lesson\\" and \\"short section or paragraph\\", with former common in Vedic recitations. In Prashna Upanishad, all these contextual roots are relevant. The text consists of questions with lessons, and the sections of the Upanishad are also called prashna. Chronology The Prashna Upanishad was probably composed in the second half of 1st millennium BCE, likely after other Atharva Veda texts such as the Mundaka Upanishad, but the precise chronology of Prasna Upanishad is unclear and contested.Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 1 The Mundaka Upanishad, for example, writes Patrick Olivelle,P Olivelle, 'Contributions to the Semantic History of Samnyasa' (Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 101, No. 3, 1981, pp. 265-274) is rather later era ancient Upanishad and is, in all probability, post-Buddhist. The chronology of Prasna Upanishad, and other ancient India texts, is difficult to resolve because all opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies.Patrick Olivelle (1996), The Early Upanishads: Annotated Text & Translation, Oxford University Press, , Introduction Chapter Olivelle states Prashna Upanishad \\"cannot be much older than the beginning of the common era\\".P Olivelle (1998), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, , page 13 Mahony suggests an earlier date, placing Prashna along with Maitri and Mandukya Upanishads, as texts that probably emerged about early fourth century BCE.WK Mahony (1987), Upanishads, in Jones, Lindsay, MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religion (2005), MacMillan, , page 9483 Phillips dates Prashna Upanishad as having been composed after Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Isha, Taittiriya and Aitareya, Kena Katha and Mundaka, but before Mandukya, Svetasvatara and Maitri Upanishads. RanadeRD Ranade, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy, Chapter 1, pages 13-18 posits a view similar to Phillips, with slightly different ordering, placing Prashna chronological composition in the fifth group of ancient Upanishads but after Svetasvatara Upanishad. Structure The Prashna Upanishad consists of six questions and their answers. Except the first and the last Prashna, all other sections ask multiple questions. The pupils credited with the six questions are respectively Kabandhin Katyayana, Bhargava Vaidarbhi, Kausalya Asvalayana, Sauryayanin Gargya, Saibya Satyakama and Sukesan Bharadvaja. Sage Pippalada is credited with giving the answers. The questions are not randomly arranged, but have an embedded structure. They begin with macrocosmic questions and then proceed to increasing details of microcosmic, thus covering both universals and particulars. Contents =Ethics before education in ancient schools= The opening verses of Prashna Upanishad describe students who arrive at a school seeking knowledge about Brahman (Ultimte Reality, Universal Soul).The Prasnopanishad with Sri Shankara's Commentary SS Sastri (Translator), pages 103-105 They ask sage Pippalada to explain this knowledge. He does not start providing answers for their education, but demands that they live with him ethically first, as follows, This preface is significant, states Johnston, as it reflects the Vedic era belief that a student's nature and mind must first show a commitment, aspiration and moral purity before knowledge is shared.CP Bhatta (2009), Holistic Personality Development through Education: Ancient Indian Cultural Experiences, Journal of Human Values, Vol. 15, No. 1, pages 49-59 Secondly, the method of first question by the student and then answer is significant, according to Johnston, as it reflects an interactive style where the student has worked out the question for himself before he is provided an answer, in contrast to a lecture style where the teacher provides the questions and answers regardless of whether the student understands either.MR Murty, Indian Philosophy: An Introduction, Broadview Press, Queens University, , pages 39-40Ronald Vale (2013), The value of asking questions, Mol. Biol. Cell, Vol. 24, No. 6, pages 680-682 The three ethical precepts emphasized in this verse of Prashna Upanishad are Tapas (austerity, perseverance, fervour), Brahmacharya (chastity, self-discipline) and Sraddha (faith, purity, calmness of mind).For meaning of the Sanskrit words in Upanishads, see also: zraddha Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon The second interesting part of the answer is the implicit admission by the teacher with \\"if we know\\", that he may not know the answer, and thus acknowledging a sense of skepticism and humility into the process of learning.RK Mishra (2000), Before the Beginning and After the End, , Chapter 2 =How did life begin? - First Prashna= A year later, sage Pippalada is asked the first question, \\"whence are living beings created?\\" Verse 1.4 of Prashna Upanishad states the sage's answer, that Prajapati did Tapas (heat, meditative penance, austerity) and created two principles: Riya (matter, feminine) and Prana (spirit, masculine), thinking that \\"these together will couple to produce for me creatures in many ways\\".Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Verse 1.4, Oxford University Press, page 272 The sun is the spirit, matter is the moon, asserts Prashna Upanishad. Sun ascends the highest, alone in splendor, warms us, is the spirit of all creatures. He is Aditya, illuminates everything, states the first Prashna, and has two paths - the northern and the southern.Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 378-379 Those who desire offspring follow the guidance of sun's southern path, while those who seek the Self (Soul) take the northern path, one of knowledge, brahmacharya, tapas and sraddha.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Verse 1.4, Oxford University Press, verses 6, 9, 10 on pages 272-273 The first chapter of Prashna Upanishad includes a number of symbolic mythological assertions. For example, it states that sun is ultimately the giver of rain and races in sky in the \\"chariot with seven wheels and six spokes\\". This symbolism is also found in more ancient Vedic literature, and the seven wheels are: half years, seasons, months, half months, days, nights and muhurtas (‡§Æ‡•Å‡§π‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§, a Vedic era division of time equaling 48 minutes and one muhurta was asserted to be 1/30th of a day).Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Verse 1.4, Oxford University Press, verses 6, 9, 10 on page 273 The six spoke symbolism refers to the Vedic practice of describing sun as having six seasons, in contrast to five seasons for earth.Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 380-381 The first section ends with verses 1.15 and 1.16 asserting that ethical living is necessary to realize the Atman-Brahman: Satya (truthfulness), Brahmacharya (chastity, celibacy if unmarried, fidelity if married), Tapas (austerity, meditation, perseverance), no Anrta (‡§Ö‡§®‡•É‡§§, falsehood, lying, deception, cheating)anRta Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne University, Germany no Jihma (‡§ú‡§ø‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ, moral crookedness, ethical obliqueness with an intent to not do the right thing),jihma Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne University, Germany and no Maya (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ, dissimulation, delusion, guile).Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Verse 1.15 and 1.16, Oxford University Press, pages 273-274The Prasnopanishad with Sri Shankara's Commentary SS Sastri (Translator), verses 15 and 16 at pages 115-116 =What is a living being? - Second Prashna= The second Prashna starts with three questions, \\"how many Deva (gods, deities, powers) uphold a living being? how many manifest their power thus? and who is the best?\\".Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Second Question Verse 2.1, Oxford University Press, page 274Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 127 The question is significant because it explicitly expresses gods to be residing in each living being and in nature, to support life. This is widely interpreted by scholars,Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 381The Prasnopanishad with Sri Shankara's Commentary SS Sastri (Translator), pages 118-119 given the context of answer that follows, to reflect the extant belief that deities express themselves in human beings and creatures through sensory organs and capabilities. The second significant aspect of the question is its structural construct, wherein the teacher is called Bhagavan, reflecting the Vedic culture of veneration and respect for teachers.Prashna Upanishad 2.1 Wikisource, Quote: \\"‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§®‡•ç ‡§ï‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ö‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§ï‡§§‡§∞ ‡§è‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡§∂‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§ï‡§É ‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡§∞‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§† ‡§á‡§§‡§ø\\" The Upanishad thus suggests multiple contextual meanings of the word Bhagavan. Such use of the term Bhagavan for teacher is repeated elsewhere, such as in the opening lines and verse 4.1 of the Prashna Upanishad, as well as in other Upanishads such as in verse 1.1.3 of the Mundaka Upanishad.R Prasad (2011), Know the Upanishads, , page 90 Sage Pippalada opens the answers to the three questions by listing five gross elements, five senses and five organs of action as expression of deities. In verses 2.3 and 2.4, the Prashna Upanishad states that Prana (breath, spirit) is the most essential and powerful of all, because without it all other deities cannot survive in a creature, they exist only when Prana is present. The deities manifest their power because of and in honor of Prana. The spirit manifests itself in nature as well as life, as Agni (fire), as sun, as air, as space, as wind, as that which has form and as that which does not have form.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Second Question Verse 2.1, Oxford University Press, pages 274-275The Prasnopanishad with Sri Shankara's Commentary SS Sastri (Translator), pages 118-125 =What is the nature of man, and how is it so? - Third Prashna= The third Prashna of the Upanishad asks six questions: (1) Whence is life born? (2) when born, how does it come into the body? (3) when it has entered the body, how does it abide? (4) how does it go out of the body? (5) how does life interface its relation with nature and senses? (6) how does life interface with Self?Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Third Question, Oxford University Press, page 276Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 383 Sage Pippalada states that these questions are difficult, and given the student's past curiosities about Brahman, he explains it as follows,Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad - Third Prasna Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 130 Life enters the body, states the Prashna Upanishad, by the act of mind. It governs the body by delegating work to other organs, sage Pippalada continues in verse 3.4, each specialized to do its own work independent of the other powers, just like a king commands his ministers to govern functions in the villages in his kingdom. The Upanishad then enumerates a theory of human body that is found in older Vedic literature, such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad hymn II.1.19.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Second Question Verse 2.1, Oxford University Press, pages 276-278 with footnotes It asserts, for example, that human body has a heart as the principal organ of soul, from where arise 101 major arteries, each major artery divides into a hundred times, which in turn subdivide into 72,000 smaller arteries, giving a total of 727,210,201 small and large arteries, and that these arteries diffuse air throughout the body. It is this life-breath which interfaces Self to all organs and life in human body, states the Upanishad.Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 383-385 The third Prashna uses symbolic phrases, relying on more ancient texts. It states, in verse 3.5 for example, that \\"seven lights\\" depend on air circulated by arteries in order to function, which is a phrase which means \\"two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and mouth\\". Its answers to metaphysical questions are physiological, rather than philosophical. =What establishes man? - Fourth Prashna= The first three Prashnas of the Upanishad focus on cause and effect of the transient, empirical, manifested world, remarks Eduard Roer. The fourth through sixth Prasna of the Upanishad focus on the nature of soul, that which is unchanging and independent of cause, of proof, and is self-evident.Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad - Fourth Prasna Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 133 with footnote 1 The fourth Prashna lists five questions: (1) What sleeps in man? (2) What is awake therein (when he sleeps)? (3) Which Deva (god, deity, organ) in man is it that sees the dreams? (4) What is it in man that experiences happiness? (5) On what is all this founded?Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Fourth Question, Oxford University Press, pages 278-279Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 385-386 The Prashna Upanishad begins the answer with a simile to state the background of extant theory, before offering its own explanation. Like rays of the sun that withdraw into the disc as it sets and that disperse ever more as it rises, all gods (sensory organs) inside man withdraw and become one in the highest Deva named Manas (mind) when he sleeps. Other people say, asserts the Upanishad, gods that reside inside man, other than the deity of mind, cease from work in this state of sleep, and in this state, the essence of a person, his soul sleeps. The Fourth Prashna of the Upanishad, thereafter presents \\"five fire\\" theory,Garhapatya fire, Dakshinagni fire, Ahavanniya fire, Sabhyagni fire and Avasatyagni fire; see pages 133-134 with footnotes in Roer, Prashna Upanishad - Fourth Prasna Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal pointing out that Prana (breath, life-force) does not sleep, that the mind sacrifices food stored in the body with air provided by breath in order to serve the mind. Dream, states the Prashna Upanishad, is a form of enjoyment for the mind, where it reconfigures and experiences again, in new ways, what it has seen before, either recently or in past, either this life or another birth, whether true or untrue (Shaccha-Ashaccha, ‡§∏‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§∏‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö), whether heard or unheard, whether pleasant or unpleasant. In dream, mind beholds all.Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad - Fourth Prasna Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 133-135The Prasnopanishad with Sri Shankara's Commentary SS Sastri (Translator), pages 135-147 There is a deep sleep state, states the Upanishad, where impressions end and the mind too sleeps without impressions, and this is the complete state of mind relaxation, of body happiness. It is then when everything in a person retires into Atman- Brahman, including the matter and elements of matter, water and elements of water, light and elements of light, eye and what is visible, ear and what is audible, smell and the objects of smell, taste and objects of taste, touch and objects of touch, speech and objects of speech, sexuality and objects of its enjoyment, feet and what is moveable, hands and what is seizable, mind and the objects of mind, thought and objects of thought, reason and objects of reason, self-consciousness and objects of self-consciousness, insight and objects of illumination, life-force and object of life-force.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Fourth Question, Oxford University Press, pages 280-281 After setting the foundation of its dream theory and deep-sleep theory, the Prashna Upanishad defines Atman as Purusha (Cosmic Self, Consciousness, Soil of all beings, Universal principle),Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 387 The Prashna Upanishad answers that happiness and bliss in man is this established calm state of knowing and dwelling in the Atman, the spiritual state of truth, beauty and goodness.Charles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), Archive of Prashna Upanishad, page 116, Theosophy Quarterly =What is meditation, and why meditate? - Fifth Prashna= The Prashna Upanishad opens the fifth section with the question: if a human being sincerely meditated on the symbol \\"Om\\" (Aum) until his death, what would he obtain by it?Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Fifth Question, Oxford University Press, pages 281-283 The section then asserts that one meditates to know \\"soul, self\\" (Atman-Brahman), then metaphorically presents the different levels of meditation, the levels of knowledge gained, and the consequent effect on the person of such meditation in this and after life. The Upanishad asserts that there are three levels of Soul knowledge, the lowest level being partial from meditating on the first letter of Aum, that is A.Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 387-389 This leads to a quick rebirth, but with ethical strengths and consequently greatness.Charles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), Archive of Prashna Upanishad, pages 117-118, Theosophy Quarterly The intermediate level of self-knowledge is akin to meditating on two letters of Aum, that is A and U. The intermediate level of self-knowledge leads the man to gain ethical behavior and the world of Manas (moon, mind), he first enjoys the heavenly life and thereafter is reborn to the world of man. The person who meditates on all aspects of self, that is all three syllables A, U and M, reaches full self-knowledge, is liberated from all suffering, sin and fears, reaches the world of Brahman. Such a man \\"beholds the soul as universal, pervading in all creatures, and eternal\\".Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 137-139 The Prashna Upanishad symbolically likens the three states of knowledge to sets of three: being awake, dream-sleep and deep-sleep; three pronunciations - tara, mandra and madhyama. (true but high tone, unclear but pleasant-base tone, perfect middle- tone that is pleasant and true, respectively). =What is immortal in man? - Sixth Prashna= The sixth Prashna in the Upanishad opens with a story of a prince visiting one of the student and asking, \\"where is the person with sixteen parts?\\" The student confesses he does not know, with the ethical precept, \\"answering with untruth, when one does not know the answer, is wrong\\".Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Sixth Question, Oxford University Press, pages 283-284 The student asks sage Pippalada the same question. The sage answers, states the Upanishad, that he and every human being has sixteen parts.Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 388-390 with footnotes This answer is significant because more ancient texts of the Vedic era, such as the Samhitas, refer to Prajapati, the Lord of Creation, as Sodasin (Sanskrit: ‡§∑‡•ã‡§°‡§∂‡§ø‡§®‡•ç) - which literally means, the one with sixteen parts.SoDazin Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon Man, implies the sixth Prashna of the Upanishad, is created in Prajapati's image and innately lord of creation. The section states, soul is immortal. Self- knowledge, the knowledge of Brahman, is the highest knowledge, state the closing verses of the Prashna Upanishad.Eduard Roer, Prashna Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 140-141 Reception Several Indian scholars reviewed and published their commentaries (bhasya) on Prashna Upanishad, including Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya. Both of them link the teachings in Prashna Upanishad to those in Mundaka Upanishad, another Upanishad that is embedded inside the Atharva Veda.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Prasna Upanishad, Oxford University Press, pages xlii-xliii The theosophist Johnston has compared quotes from Prashna Upanishad with those in Gospel of Matthew, in his examples of how there are parallels and similarities in Hindu and Christian theology.C Johnston, The Kingdom of Heaven and the Upanishads, The Open Court, Vol. XIX, No. 12, pages 705-716 I.B. Horner quotes from Prashna Upanishad examples of how the teachings in Hindu Upanishads and early Buddhist Dhamma texts are similar.IB Horner, Early Buddhist Dhamma, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 11, No. 1/2 (1948), pages 115-123 Halder includes Prasna Upanishad among the numerous ancient texts of India that is loaded with symbolism.AK Haldar (1950), Symbolism in Indian Art and Religion, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism Vol. 9, No. 2, pages 124-127 Mlecko highlights Prashna Upanishad, among other Vedic literature, in his review of education system and the revered role of teachers (Guru) in Vedic era of Hinduism.Joel D.

Ganesh Vidyalankar Category:Upanishads Category:Hindu texts ","title":"Prashna Upanishad"},{"id":"2457905","text":"William Frank Szymczyk (; born February 13, 1943) is an American music producer and technical engineer best known for working with rock and blues musicians, most notably the Eagles in the 1970s. He produced many top albums and singles of the 1970s, though he retired from the music business by 1990. He re-emerged in the late 2000s, taking on select projects including the 2007 Eagles album Long Road Out of Eden and the 2008 eponymous debut of Brian Vander Ark. Unlike many music producers, Szymczyk has no background as a musician. He was originally a sonar operator for the U.S. Navy and took some audio production classes as part of his Navy training. Besides his work with the Eagles, he has produced hit songs and albums for such diverse artists as B.B. King, Joe Walsh, The James Gang, and Elvin Bishop. Early life Bill Szymczyk was born in Muskegon, Michigan on February 13, 1943. His mother worked as a nurse, and his father held several jobs, including factory worker and maintenance at a school. Growing up, his first introduction to music and electronics was when he built his own crystal radio from a kit. Using his radio, he became a fan of blues and R&B; while listening to a station out of Nashville, Tennessee. He joined the United States Navy in 1960, where he worked as a sonar technician. It was in the Navy that he took his first course in radio and television production. Upon leaving the service in 1964, and without much of an idea of what to do for a post-military career, he enrolled at New York University's Media Arts School. Professional career Szymczyk began working at a firm which produced demo recordings for Screen Gems Records and worked extensively with Brill Building songwriters such as Carole King and Gerry Goffin. He also worked as an assistant to music producers and songwriters Quincy Jones and Jerry Ragovoy, eventually working his way up to chief engineer at Ragavoy's Hit Factory recording studio in New York City. His first work as the primary producer on an album came for a Harvey Brooks solo record. He dropped out of NYU to work full-time in the music industry. He left the Hit Factory and took a job at ABC Records, taking a large pay cut in exchange for the opportunity to move from engineer to producer. He successfully lobbied ABC to let him work with B. B. King, whose own record label was a subsidiary of ABC and who was a long time idol of Szymczyk's. After Szymczyk convinced King that he could improve his sound to make him more appealing to a wider audience, King himself agreed to let Szymczyk produce for him. Among the albums he produced for King are the 1969 live album Live & Well, King's first ever top-100 album. He produced his follow-up studio album Completely Well, which featured \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\", the biggest hit of King's career and his signature song. He would continue to produce blues albums throughout the early 1970s for the likes of King and Albert Collins. Szymczyk was moved several times while working for ABC Records; first to Los Angeles when ABC acquired Dunhill Records and Szymczyk took over production for the West Coast operations, and later to Denver when he decided to form his own label, Tumbleweed Records. He worked for a while as a disc jockey at radio station KFML, and continued to produce albums in New York and Los Angeles, such as the J. Geils Band's 1971 album The Morning After, recorded at the Los Angeles Record Plant. He did extensive work at the Colorado studio Caribou Ranch. After producing the James Gang's first three albums, he followed singer-guitarist Joe Walsh when he left the band, first as a solo artist with the Szymczyk-produced albums Barnstorm (the first recorded at the Caribou Ranch studio) and The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get and later with the Eagles. His most prolific collaborations have been with Walsh; the two have made over 15 albums together in many settings. Walsh himself moved to Boulder, Colorado in 1971 in order to work with Szymczyk and the location would inspire one of Walsh's biggest solo hits, 1973's \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\". Besides work with Walsh in his band The James Gang and as a solo artist, he also brought Walsh in to work on several albums he was doing with other musicians, using him as a session player for the B. B. King album Indianola Mississippi Seeds and the Michael Stanley album Friends and Legends. It was at Szymczyk's suggestion that the Eagles bring in Walsh to give them a \\"rock\\" edge; Walsh has remained a core member of the band to this day. Bill Szymczyk (left) and Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound 2014 His long relationship with the Eagles began with their 1974 album On the Border, an album he took over from London-based producer Glyn Johns. He would be the sole producer for the next three Eagles studio albums, including 1976's Hotel California, the first to feature Joe Walsh. Szymczyk was instrumental in giving the Eagles a more \\"rock sound\\" and helping them to move away from their country rock roots. Among the other acts he worked with extensively through the 1970s include Michael Stanley and the J. Geils Band. While working with The Outlaws, he coined the term \\"Guitar Army\\" to describe the band's sound; the name continues as a nickname for the band. He worked in the studio for the Edgar Winter Group's biggest hit, the Rick Derringer-produced \\"Frankenstein\\", and later produced Derringer's best known solo album All American Boy and its hit single, \\"Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo\\". At the start of the 1980s he was a highly sought-after producer, and worked on such albums as Bob Seger's 1980 album Against the Wind and The Who's 1981 release Face Dances. During this time period, Szymczyk produced such hit singles as Elvin Bishop's \\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\\", The Who's \\"You Better You Bet\\", The Eagles' \\"Hotel California\\", and Bob Seger's \\"Against the Wind\\". His workload tailed off in the mid-1980s, due mostly to his own financial success. He officially retired from the music industry in 1990, but re-emerged in 2005, producing Dishwalla's self-titled fourth album. He returned to work with the Eagles on the 2007 album Long Road Out of Eden, and followed that with the 2008 solo debut of ex-Verve Pipe singer Brian Vander Ark. He now lives in Little Switzerland, North Carolina with his wife Lisi. The couple have two sons, Michael and Daniel, and have become involved in their local community, having raised money for a local shelter for victims of domestic violence, among other charity work. He still works as a producer, but is more selective about projects he works on. Production style Szymczyk's has frequently been noted as the sort of producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: \\"I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth. I just listen and try to figure out if I have anything I can bring to a song.\\" For his work with the Eagles, he has been cited for his innovative mixing of drums, laboriously working to get the right microphones and placements for just the right sound. Rather than recording harmony vocals individually, and mixing them together later, as was common, Szymczyk preferred to capture the Eagles singing in ensemble, often spending many hours to record each phrase \\"just right\\". For the Elvin Bishop hit, \\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love,\\" it was Szymczyk who suggested the inclusion of the song on Bishop's Struttin' My Stuff album, feeling the blues-oriented album lacked a pop single. The song would go on to become Bishop's biggest hit. Such a pattern was repeated throughout his career. The Eagles brought him in to refine and improve their \\"rock\\" sound, and all of their biggest selling albums and songs were Szymczyk- produced. Martin Turner of Wishbone Ash has called him \\"my all time favourite producer\\". While the two did not always get along during recording, usually over Turner's bass-playing style, Turner does credit Szymczyk with giving the band a more commercial sound on one of their most successful albums, 1974's There's the Rub.

History  The party was founded at the end of the presidency of Jules Wijdenbosch (1996-2000). Due to disagreements between Wijdenbosch and fellow National Democratic Party leader Desi Bouterse, the NDP withdrew its support for Wijdenbosch's government and decided to contest 2000 elections separately. The Party for National Unity and Solidarity, which held five ministries as part of the ruling coalition, decided to follow the NDP. However, three of its ministers (including Soewarto Moestadja) decided to support Wijdenbosch; they broke from the party and founded Democrats of the 21st Century (D21). The new party did not win any seats in the 2000 election. Five years later, D21 joined the A1-Combination, a coalition that also included Democratic Alternative '91, the Political Wing of the FAL and Meeting Point 2000. This coalition won three seats in total, with none from D21. D21 left the coalition in 2008. D21 formally merged with the Pertjajah Luhur on 16 March 2010.

Launched in 1751, she was used as a survey ship from 1764 and made two circumnavigations of the world under the successive commands of John Byron and Samuel Wallis. She was the first ship to circumnavigate the world twice. She remained in service until she was paid off in September 1776, and she was broken up in early 1777. Construction Built to the 1745 Establishment, Dolphin was originally ordered from the private yard of Earlsman Sparrow in Rotherhithe (under contract dated 7 October 1747). Following Sparrow's bankruptcy in 1748, the order was moved to Woolwich Dockyard. In order to reduce the likely incidence of shipworm, Dolphins hull was copper-sheathed ahead of her first voyage of circumnavigation in 1764.Beaglehole 1966, p.195  Early service  Not long after her commissioning, the hostilities of the Seven Years' War had escalated and spread to Europe, and in May 1756 Britain declared war on France of the Ancien R√©gime. Dolphin was pressed into service throughout the conflict, and was present at the Battle of Minorca in 1756 when a fleet under Admiral John Byng failed to relieve Port Mahon, Britain's main base in the Western Mediterranean (as a result of which Byng was later court- martialled and shot).  First circumnavigation  With Britain's successful conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1763, her attentions turned towards consolidating her gains and continuing to expand her trade and influence at the expense of the other competing European powers. The Pacific Ocean was beginning to be opened up by exploratory European vessels, and interest had developed in this route as an alternate to reach the East Indies. This interest was compounded by theories put forward which suggested that a large, hitherto-unknown continental landmass (Terra Australis Incognita) must exist at southern latitudes to \\"counterbalance\\" the northern hemisphere's landmasses. No longer in a state of war, the Admiralty had more funds, ships and men at her disposal to devote to exploratory ventures. Accordingly, an expedition was soon formed with instructions to investigate and establish a South Atlantic base from which Britain could keep an eye on voyages bound for the Pacific. Another purpose was to generally explore for unknown lands which could then be claimed and exploited by the Crown, and to reach the Far East if necessary. Dolphin was selected as lead vessel for this voyage, and she was to be accompanied by the sloop . Her captain was Commodore John Byron, a 42-year- old veteran of the sea, and younger brother to the profligate William Byron, 5th Baron Byron. Between June 1764 and May 1766 Dolphin completed the circumnavigation of the globe. This was the first such circumnavigation of less than two years. During this voyage, in 1765, Byron took possession of the Falkland Islands on behalf of Britain on the grounds of prior discovery, and in so doing was nearly the cause of a war between Great Britain and Spain, both countries having armed fleets ready to contest the sovereignty of the barren islands. Later Byron visited islands of Tuamotus, Tokelau and Nikunau in the Gilbert Islands, putting them on European maps for the first time (in European circles, Nikunau went by the name \\"Byron Island\\" for over 100 years); and visited Tinian in the Northern Marianas Islands. Second circumnavigation Memorial to Samuel Wallis and the crew in Truro Cathedral Dolphin circumnavigated the world for a second time, under the command of Samuel Wallis. Her master's mate, John Gore, was among a number of the crew from Byron's circumnavigation who crewed with Wallis. The master on this voyage, George Robertson, subsequently wrote a book The discovery of Tahiti; a journal of the second voyage of H.M.S. Dolphin round the world under the command of Captain Wallis, R.N., in the years 1766, 1767, and 1768, written by her master.Alibris Dolphin sailed in 1766 in the company of HMS Swallow, under the command of Philip Carteret, who had served on Byron's circumnavigation. Dolphin dropped anchor at the peninsula of Tahiti Iti (\\"small Tahiti\\", aka Taiarapu) on 17 June 1767 but quickly left to find a better anchorage. Wallis chose Matavai Bay on 23 June. Although the Spanish had visited the Marquesas Islands in 1595, some 170 years earlier, Wallis officially took possession of Otaheiti, which he named \\"King George III Island\\". (About a year later, French navigator Louis-Antoine de Bougainville landed at Hitiaa on the opposite side of Tahiti and unaware of Wallis's earlier visit, claimed it for the King of France.) Early on a large canoe approached Dolphin and at a signal its occupants launched a storm of stones at the British, who replied with grapeshot. Dolphin's gunnery cut the canoe in two, killing most of its occupants. Wallis then sent his carpenters ashore to cut the eighty-some canoes there in half. Eventually, friendly relations were established between the British sailors and the locals. The relationships became particularly friendly when the sailors discovered that the women were eager to exchange sex for iron. This trade became so extensive that the loss of nails started to threaten Dolphin's physical integrity.Couper (2009), pp. 64‚Äì65, 69.

R-kioski comprises R-kioski in Finland, R-kiosk in Estonia and Lietuvos Spauda in Lithuania. There are 560 R-kioski shops across Finland . They sell a range of products, such as books, magazines, tobacco, ready meals, snacks, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider, excluding wine and spirits. R-kioski shops also provide services such as the various \\"Veikkaus\\" games, prepaid mobile phone top-up vouchers, and fishing licences, as well as the sale of public transport tickets. Selected shops are also able to sell national rail and bus transport tickets. R-kioski is known as \\"√Ñrr√§\\" (the name of the letter R in Finnish) in common language. The company slogan is \\"Nopeaa ja mukavaa on asiointi\\" (It's swift and convenient to shop). The first R-kiosk in Estonia opened in 1993, and there are 107 shops in Estonia. Reitan Convenience posted a turnover of 1.63 billion Euros in 2017. Reitan Convenience invested 18 million Euros in R-kioski in 2013 and 2014 together. The money was invested to broaden the product selection as well as to lower the price of food to par with other retail chains competing in the same market such as Alepa and Siwa. History An R-kioski on Bulevardi in Helsinki in 2006. An interior of R-kioski in Jyv√§skyl√§. The company dates back to 1910. The business was originally conceived by several major Finnish publishing houses as a newsagent for railway stations (\\"Rautakirja\\" was itself shortened from \\"Rautatiekirjakauppa\\" which translates to \\"railway bookshop\\"). It was later extended to other venues and products. The name R-kioski was adopted in 1958. On 5 March 2012, it was announced that the Reitan Group bought R-kioski from Sanoma for roughly 130 million Euros. The group had been working on the purchase for a decade, but previous negotiations had stranded as R-kioski had demanded a merger where they owned 51 percent. The purchase brought the Reitan Group to 2,500 kiosk outlets, making it the second-largest kiosk group in Europe. The company operated also in Romania, but sold operations to R-kioski Romania CEO Dan Vasile in 2011. The name R-kioski was to be abandoned in Romania after a grace period following the corporate acquisition.

Farber on Film: The Complete Film Writings of Manny Farber. New York: Library of America, 2009. Xv-Xxxviii. Farber's painting, which was often influenced by his favorite filmmakers, is held in equally high regard; he was dubbed the greatest still life painter of his generation by The New York Times. Later in life, Farber focused more on art and teaching. He often worked in close collaboration with his wife, Patricia Patterson, also an artist. Life and career Manny Farber was born in Douglas, Arizona, the youngest of three brothers. His two older siblings, David and Leslie H. Farber, both became psychiatrists. Farber attended UC Berkeley, Stanford University and the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design. In the 1930s, Farber worked as a painter and carpenter, first in San Francisco and then in Washington DC. During this time, he attempted to join the Communist Party, though later in his life Farber was often critical of post- New Deal liberal politics. His journalistic career began as an art critic, and in 1942 he moved to New York City and took a post as a film critic for The New Republic. This was followed by stints at Time (1949), The Nation (1949‚Äì54), New Leader (1958‚Äì59), Cavalier (1966) and Artforum (1967‚Äì71). He has also contributed to Commentary, Film Culture, Film Comment, and City Magazine. He contributed art criticism to The New Republic and The Nation during the 1940s through 1950s. Farber left New York City to teach at the University of California, San Diego in 1970. Reportedly, Farber traded his Manhattan loft to artist Don Lewallen in exchange for Lewallen's teaching position at UCSD after the two met at a party. Once in San Diego, he focused on painting and teaching, and retired from criticism altogether in 1977. Originally an art professor only, Farber was approached about teaching a film class because of his background as a critic. He taught several courses, including \\"History of Film\\" and \\"Films in Social Context,\\" which became famous for his unusual teaching style: he usually showed films only in disconnected pieces, sometimes running them backwards or adding in slides and sketches on the blackboard to illustrate his ideas. His exams had a reputation for being demanding and complicated, and occasionally required students to draw storyboards of scenes from memory. Farber retired from teaching in 1987, at age 70. Towards the end of his life, he found it difficult to paint, and instead focused on collages and drawings; his final exhibition of new work occurred just a month before his death. He died at his home in Leucadia, near Encinitas, California, on August 18, 2008. Style Farber's writing is well known for its distinctive prose style, which he personally described as \\"a struggle to remain faithful to the transitory, multisuggestive complication of a movie image.\\" He cited the sportswriters of his era as an influence, and frequently used sports metaphors, especially ones related to baseball, in his writings on art and cinema. Farber frequently championed genre filmmakers like Howard Hawks, Anthony Mann and Raoul Walsh; however, despite his fondness for B-films, Farber was often critical of film noir. =\\"White Elephant Art vs. Termite Art\\"= One of Farber's best-known essays is \\"White Elephant Art vs. Termite Art\\", which originally appeared in 1962 in Film Culture. In it, he writes on the virtues of \\"termite art\\" and the excesses of \\"white elephant art\\" and champions the B film and under-appreciated auteurs, which he felt were able, termite-like, to burrow into a topic. Bloated, pretentious, white elephant art lacks the economy of expression found in the greatest works of termite art, according to Farber. \\"Termite-tapeworm-fungus-moss art,\\" Farber contends, \\"goes always forward eating its own boundaries, and, like as not, leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager, industrious, unkempt activity.\\"Farber, Manny (1998).

Typically gnotobiotic organisms are germ-free or gnotophoric (having only one contaminant). Gnotobiotic animals A gnotobiotic animal is an animal in which only certain known strains of bacteria and other microorganisms are present. Technically, the term also includes germ-free animals, as the status of their microbial communities is also known. However, the term gnotobiotic is often incorrectly contrasted with germ-free. Gnotobiotic animals (also \\"gnotobiotes\\" or \\"gnotobionts\\") are born in aseptic conditions, which may include removal from the mother by Caesarean section and immediate transfer of the newborn to an isolator where all incoming air, food and water is sterilized. Such animals are normally reared in a sterile or microbially- controlled laboratory environment, and they are only exposed to those microorganisms that the researchers wish to have present in the animal. These gnotobiotes are used to study the symbiotic relationships between an animal and one or more of the microorganisms that may inhabit its body. This technique is important for microbiologists because it allows them to study only a select few symbiotic interactions at a time (see Scientific control), whereas animals that develop under normal conditions may quickly acquire a microbiota that includes hundreds or thousands of unique organisms. Animals reared in a gnotobiotic colony often have poorly developed immune systems, lower cardiac output, thin intestinal walls and high susceptibility to infectious pathogens. Such animals may also be used in animal production, especially in the rearing of pigs. After the Caesarean birth, these animals are introduced to their natural microflora in a stepwise fashion. This avoids undesired infections and leads to faster growth.

Doctors wear lab coats. The coat protects their street clothes and also serves as a simple uniform. The garment is made from white or light-colored cotton, linen, or cotton polyester blend, allowing it to be washed at high temperature and making it easy to see if it is clean. Similar coats are a symbol of learning in Argentina and Uruguay, where they are worn by both students and teachers in state schools. In Tunisia and Mozambique, teachers wear white coats to protect their street clothes from chalk. Like the word \\"suit\\", the phrase \\"white coat\\" is sometimes used as a synecdoche to denote the wearer, such as a scientist working in a high-tech company.  Medicine  A student's alt= White coats are sometimes seen as the distinctive dress of both physicians and surgeons, who have worn them for over 100 years.Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, \\"Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress\\", Fashion Theory, (2015), pp.1-23. doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 In the nineteenth century, respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the quackery and mysticism of nineteenth-century medicine. To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach of modern medicine, physicians began to represent themselves as scientists, donning the most recognizable symbol of the scientist, the white laboratory coat. Recently, white coat ceremonies have become popular amongst those starting medical school. The modern white coat was introduced to medicine in the late 1800s as a symbol of cleanliness. = Patient perceptions = A study conducted in the United Kingdom found that the majority of patients prefer their doctors to wear white coats, but the majority of doctors prefer other clothing, such as scrubs. The study found that psychiatrists were among the least likely to wear white coats and when they are worn, they are typically worn over the scrubs. Some medical doctors view the coats as hot and uncomfortable, and many feel that they spread infection. = White coat hypertension = Some patients who have their blood pressure measured in a clinical setting have higher readings than they do when measured in a home setting. This is apparently a result of patients feeling more relaxed when they are at home. The phenomenon is sometimes called \\"white coat hypertension,\\" in reference to the traditional white coats worn in a clinical setting, though the coats themselves may have nothing to do with the elevated readings. = Psychiatry = The term is also used as verbal shorthand for psychiatric orderlies or other personnel and may be used, in a usually jocular manner, to imply someone's lunacy or paranoia. = White versus black = A tie-dyed lab coat Until the mid-1920s, students who were examining cadavers would wear black lab coats to show respect for the dead. Black lab coats were used in early biomedical and microbiology laboratories. The \\"whiteness\\" and \\"pureness\\" concepts that were established in medicine pervaded that environment at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries and physicians changed the black for the white coat.Hochberg, M., S. History of medicine The doctor‚Äôs white coat‚Äîan historical perspective. American Medical Association Journal of Ethics April 2007, Volume 9, Number 4: 310-314.History of medicine = White coat ceremony = A white coat ceremony is a relatively new ritual that marks one's entrance into medical school and, more recently, into a number of health-related schools and professions. It originated at University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine in 1989 and involves a formal \\"robing\\" or \\"cloaking\\" in white lab coats. = Controversy = Studies have shown that doctor's coats worn in hospitals can harbor contagions including MRSA. In 2007, the UK National Health Service started banning long-sleeved coats. In 2009, the American Medical Association investigated banning coats with long sleeves to protect patients, but did not institute a ban. A study published in 2011 investigating the effectiveness of the NHS ban showed no statistical difference in contamination levels over an 8-hour period between residents wearing long-sleeved coats and those wearing short-sleeved scrubs. In an effort to reduce the contamination of healthcare uniforms, ASTM International is developing standards to specifically address liquid penetration resistance, liquid repellency, bacterial decontamination, and antimicrobial properties of such uniforms.  In laboratory work  When used in the laboratory, lab coats protect against accidental spills, e.g., acids. In this case, they usually have long sleeves and are made of absorbent material, such as cotton, so that the user can be protected from the chemical. Some lab coats have buttons or elastic at the end of the sleeves, to secure them around the wrist so that they do not hang into containers of chemicals. Short-sleeved lab coats also exist where protection from substances such as acid is not necessary, and are favoured by certain scientists, such as microbiologists, avoiding the problem of hanging sleeves altogether, combined with the ease of washing the forearms (an important consideration in microbiology). = Howie coats = Viral & Human Genomics Laboratory (Facultad de Medicina UASLP) team members using Howie lab coats. For added safety, a variant of the lab coat called a \\"Howie\\" style lab coat is often adopted. It is called such after a 1978 report commissioned by the UK Department of Health and Social Security to codify standard clinical laboratory practices, chaired by J. W. Howie. Among the codified standards was protective clothing; the type of wrap-around full coverage lab coat that had been in use in the UK for over a hundred years was nicknamed the \\"Howie-Style\\" coat to indicate its compliance with the provisions of this report. It has the buttons on the left flank, elasticated wrists and a mandarin collar, and is quite similar to a chef's uniform. It is designed to minimize pathogen contact with street clothes.  Use as a school uniform  The ubiquitous white uniform of Argentine school children is a national symbol of learning. White coats which resemble lab coats are worn by students and teachers of most public primary schools as a daily uniform in countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, Bolivia and Morocco, and in private schools in Colombia. It also was formerly worn during past decades in Paraguay and Chile.

He also appears in the prequel, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.Leland Palmer (character) on IMDb Leland (played by Ray Wise) is an attorney, with his primary client being local businessman Ben Horne. He is well-known and respected in the town of Twin Peaks. Together with his wife Sarah and his daughter Laura, his family seems to be perfect. When Laura is murdered, however, Leland's psychological foundations begin to crumble, and it is gradually revealed that extreme dysfunction, including incest, lies beneath the Palmer family's idyllic surface. Appearances =Twin Peaks= In the pilot episode of the series, Leland is called into the morgue to identify Laura's body. The grief pushes him over the edge; he throws himself into the grave at Laura's funeral and has to be dragged out, and for the next few weeks he manically asks people - even complete strangers - to dance with him as Laura had, all while sobbing hysterically. When Jacques Renault is arrested as a suspect in Laura's murder, Leland murders him by suffocating him with a pillow. After killing Jacques, Leland's hair turns white overnight. Leland is arrested, but released on a personal recognizance bond pending trial due to personal assurances made by Sheriff Harry S. Truman that he does not pose any danger to the community. Leland's behavior at times appears abnormal - manically happy at times, exhibited by singing the 1940s popular nonsense song \\"Mairzy Doats\\", before crashing into grief. The arrival of his niece-in-law Madeline \\"Maddy\\" Ferguson, who looks almost exactly like Laura (both roles are played by Sheryl Lee), is of great help to him in learning how to deal with his daughter's death. It is eventually revealed that, as a boy, Leland met a strange neighbor who turned out to be a demonic entity named BOB, who would possess him throughout his life. It is also implied that BOB molested him as a child. It is difficult to tell when and if Leland is truly in control of himself and when he is being possessed by BOB. It is implied that Leland killed Jacques Renault on his own - not under BOB's control - and that Leland is lost from that point: he is no longer able to stop BOB and is completely taken over, physically manifested by the change of hair color and a dramatic change in behavior. Finally, BOB takes control of Leland and murders Maddy. The changes in Leland from this point help Special Agent Dale Cooper to finally identify him as BOB's \\"host\\". Leland is eventually exposed as the murderer of both his daughter and his niece Maddy and is arrested by Cooper and Truman. He later dies in custody following a bizarre interrogation on the night of his arrest. BOB takes control of Leland and forces him to run headfirst into the metal door of an interrogation room. At the moment of his death, Leland remembers the crimes he committed under BOB's control, and cries out in agony. After Cooper recites the last rites from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Leland sees a vision of his daughter Laura and dies. Later on, Cooper explains to the widowed Sarah that he believes the vision was of Laura forgiving Leland and welcoming him into the afterlife. In the final episode of the series, Cooper encounters a grinning doppelg√§nger of Leland in the Black Lodge, who says \\"I did not kill anybody.\\" =Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me= The prequel film Fire Walk With Me, which depicts the last week of Laura's life, reveals that Bob had begun raping her when she was 12 years old while possessing Leland. The abuse drives Laura into a life of drug addiction and promiscuity, and she begins working as a call girl. She often turns tricks together with Theresa Banks - whom Leland frequently visits while away on business. He arranges a \\"party\\" with Banks and two other girls, only to find out that the two girls are Laura and her friend Ronette Pulaski. He pays Banks and leaves, but comes back later that night and beats her to death. A year later, he sees Laura having group sex with Pulaski, Renault and Leo Johnson; enraged, BOB uses Leland to attack, beat and rape both girls, before killing Laura, even as Leland begs BOB not to make him do it. He wraps Laura's body in plastic and dumps it in a river. He then appears in the Black Lodge, where he meets The Man From Another Place and MIKE, BOB's former partner in murder. =Series relaunch= When Twin Peaks was revived in 2017, Ray Wise confirmed that he would appear in the new series, once again portraying Leland Palmer. In the second episode of the renewed series, Leland appears in the Black Lodge imploring Cooper to \\"find Laura\\". In Part 18, he also repeats his instructions to Cooper when he returns to the Black Lodge. Due to time alterations following Part 17, it is said that Leland committed suicide on February 24, 1990, one year after his daughters disappearance (she was never confirmed to have been murdered in the changed timeline).

Naval engineers are in charge of the management and upkeep of ship-board machinery. Traditionally this included engines, motors, pumps and other mechanical devices, but modern engineers are now responsible for both mechanical systems and high-tech electronics such radar and sonar systems and nuclear-power plants.  Ranking  When the corps was first created, there were three ranks for engineers: First, second, and third. Over the years this ranking system has changed several times: * 1835 - First, second and third engineer. * 1847 - Inspector of machinery, chief engineer; first, second and third engineer. * 1886 - Chief inspector and inspector of machinery (r.adm and captain), fleet engineer (cdr), and staff engineer (senior lieutenant). * 1904 - Standard executive rank titles with an \\"engineer\\" prefix. * 1956 - \\"Engineer\\" prefix and rank branch distinction cloth removed finally making engineers indistinguishable from seaman officers.  Fields of expertise  After graduating from university and receiving a basic training, naval engineer officers specialize in a particular field. * Marine engineer officer (MEO) - deals with the fuel, air, water, electrical, and propulsion systems including nuclear reactors for those appointed to submarines. * Air engineer officer (AEO) - maintenance and upgrading of engines and electrical systems in aircraft. * Weapon engineer officer (WEO) - ensures that weapon systems are working properly.  Students  In 1888 engineer studentships were created. Today, there are several different student-scholarship programs available including the University Cadetship Entry, a competitive program in which students enlist and train at Britannia Royal Naval College before going to university.

The suburb is home to several of Peshawar's educational and health institutions. Hayatabad is named after Hayat Sherpao- a Pakistani Pashtun politician assassinated in 1975 by Afghan Communist militant group in a bomb blast in Peshawar.  Geography  Hayatabad was developed as a residential area near Peshawar in the late 1970s. Primarily residential, it also contains an Industrial Estate. Hayatabad was developed as an upscale suburb The government has divided Hayatabad into seven numbered phases. Each phase is subdivided into lettered sectors, A-H. The suburb can be accessed via three routes from Jamrud Road and one from the Ring Road. A fifth route was also constructed, but was sealed for security reasons arising from War on Terror, due to its boundary with the tribal area.

They worked in partnership as printers to the University of Glasgow. Biography Andrew Foulis was the son of a local Glasgow barber and maltman, named Andrew Faulls (or Faulds). Andrew Foulis, intended for the church, received the better education than Robert Foulis, who was intending to take up his father's trade as a barber. However, Robert still sat in on classes at the University of Glasgow and received an unofficial education and a formal mentor from Francis Hutcheson. Both Andrew and Robert had changed their surname from Faulls to Foulis in the 1730s. Robert shared a passion with Andrew Foulis for knowledge and found the way for them to contribute to academia beyond a professorship; also, the professor Francis Hutcheson was the first person to encourage Robert to take up an interest in Book selling and printing. Robert had initially started the press, however Andrew Foulis had joined in on the venture to form a partnership after spending 1738 and 1739 in England and France together. In Paris, Andrew and Robert had found some extraordinary books that they had purchased, imported back to England and then sold them for a profit; hence the beginning of their lucrative and prestigious partnership. Andrew and Robert's enterprise would continue for the next 30 years. Andrew Foulis had studied at the University of Glasgow with a focus in Humanity (Latin). Foulis would later teach Latin, Greek, and French in Glasgow. In 1738, Andrew and Robert Foulis were traveling; when they arrived in Paris, they were introduced to well known expatriate Scottish writer Chevalier Andrew Ramsay (Ramsay is known for his tutoring of Prince James Francis Edward Stuart's two sons in Rome including Prince Charles Edward Stuart). The acquaintance to Ramsay had led the Foulis brothers to the most fine and exclusive Parisian libraries, of which a good number of the contents had become the Foulis brothers' initial success that had launched their book dealing business. In 1741, Foulis' brother Robert had established the bookshop at Glasgow; this was a full ten years prior to John Smith opening his first shop in the city. The brothers didn't take too long to start publishing their own books. Within the first year, all the printing for the Foulis publishing had to be outsourced to other printers, but by their second year they had acquired their own printing press and were able to handle all of the publishing needs in house. Shortly thereafter, the Foulis brothers' printing and book shop became the University of Glasgow's Printer. Their publications were achieving high repute for being of great quality printing and publishing in mainly the classical and literary works. Their unique printing style had found an identity with Alexander Wilson's type faces. Wilson had helped the Foulis Press' publication reach the beauty and sophistication that was so highly reported by their customers, the more notable type face that Wilson supplied the Foulis brothers was Scotch Roman. In 1748, Wilson had been made the University of Glasgow's Type founder and moved his foundry there until it was shutdown in 1834. Andrew and Robert Foulis had dominated the book trade in Glasgow during this period. Their more notable achievements were those of their internationally renowned editions of Homer's classics \\"The Iliad\\" and \\"The Odyssey\\" from 1756 to 1758. The brothers were extolled over their famous prints and editions; they were even complimented with being referred to as \\"the Elzevirs of Britain\\". The Elzevirs were a Dutch family that had a printing press and published as well as sold books during the 17th and 18th centuries. The brothers had also published more practical and less extravagant editions of the classics and works from contemporary writers, including their mentor Francis Hutcheson. According to Richard B. Sher and Andrew Hooks the brothers had a goal and vision that they hoped their publishing would fulfill; \\"to translate into print culture the values of the classical, aesthetic, moralistic, Hutchesonian Enlightenment in Glasgow.\\" Andrew Foulis and his brother Robert were not just publishers of academia's works‚Äîas it was concerned in Glasgow‚Äîbut also enthusiasts of them. James Boswell had recorded that the famous contemporary literary figure Samuel Johnson had visited Glasgow and was humbly taken in as an honored and famous guest by the Foulis brothers. Boswell stated that Johnson was rather upset with his two hosts‚ÄîAndrew and Robert Foulis‚Äîby them simply arguing with Johnson and answering back. The vast majority of the Foulis Press' books were intended for scholars but some of their books had also been made to print specifically for collectors whom wanted select books. Andrew and Robert Foulis continued with bringing an eclectic range of edition to the classics. The Foulis Presses continued to import rare editions of the classics and purchase manuscripts with promising upside from mainland Europe and in turn sold them to the local scholars and collectors. They printed editions of books from the very expensive fine paper prints to the very novel and practical, even miniature editions. The Foulis Print editions of the classic books were sought after for being well edited, simple and of practical size.Robert and Andrew Foulis, the Foulis Press, and Their Legacy; George Fairfull Smith; University of Glasgow Library Special Collections; April 2001 Their publications were famous both for beauty and accuracy; the 554 works they printed included editions of Horace, Homer, Milton, and Thomas Gray. Although the prestige of their typography waned, it nonetheless represented high achievement in a style of the time. Their typefaces, the most enduring of which is Scotch Roman, were designed by Alexander Wilson. He is buried with Robert in the Ramshorn Cemetery on Ingram Street. Due to a widening of Ingram Street the graves now lie beneath the pavement but are still marked, using their initials in the paving.

She was created by the series creators Mark Frost and David Lynch and portrayed by M√§dchen Amick. She is a main character in the original series, and has a supporting role in the prequel films Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) and Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces (2014). Shelly returns in the 2017 revival series. In the original series, Shelly dropped out of high school to marry the trucker Leo Johnson, who began to abuse her after their marriage. Shelly works as a waitress at the Double R Diner and has an affair with Bobby Briggs. In Twin Peaks: The Return, it is revealed that Shelly married Bobby and still works at the Double R Diner. Her main storyline focuses on her trying to save their troubled daughter, Becky Burnett, from her own marriage to an abusive drug addict. Appearances =In television= Shelly is a waitress who dropped out of high school to marry the trucker Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re), who she had fallen for after he gave her attention. Once they got married, however, she realized Leo just \\"wanted a maid he didn't have to pay for\\", and that he became abusive whenever he didn't get his way. Shelly has been having an affair with Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), Laura's boyfriend. Leo finds out, and attempts to kill Shelly by tying her up inside the Packard Saw Mill and setting it on fire. However, Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie), another intended victim of the fire, frees Shelly and helps her escape. During the second season, Leo is in a catatonic state after being shot by Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey). Shelly quits her job at the Double R Diner to care for Leo at home, where she and Bobby live together. When Leo awakens from his catatonia and tries to kill Shelly, Bobby comes and fights with Leo. Shelly stabs Leo in the leg, and Leo wanders off into the woods. Shelly later asks Norma for her old job at the Double R Diner, which Norma gives back to her. Shelly later receives fragments of poetry from former FBI agent Windom Earle (Kenneth Welsh). Shelly later enters the Miss Twin Peaks contest. Bobby later proposes to her, but she says no because she is still married to Leo. Leo is shot and murdered shortly after the events of the original series and autopsied by special agent Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) on April 1, 1989; the cause had been five gunshots assumed by Rosenfield to have been fired by Earle, though tarantula bites had been present as well. Shelly and Bobby marry almost exactly one year later. Shelly returned in the 2017 Twin Peaks series with M√§dchen Amick reprising her role. Shelly and Bobby divorced at some point prior to the revival, and they have an adult daughter, Becky (Amanda Seyfried). Shelly first appears in the second episode, drinking with friends at the Roadhouse, where she expresses concern for Becky, who is married to Steven Burnett (Caleb Landry Jones), an unemployed, abusive drug addict. She later has a nostalgic moment with James Hurley (James Marshall). In the fifth episode, Shelly is shown still working at the Double R Diner. Becky comes in and begs her for money, and Shelly reluctantly gives her all of the money that she has. Her boss Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton), who has been described as a 'surrogate mother' figure for Shelly, has been observing the situation, comforts Shelly and tells her that she needs to help her daughter while she still can. In the eleventh episode, while working at the Double R Diner, Shelly receives a phone call from a distressed Becky and runs out of the diner to go help her. When she arrives at Becky's trailer, her daughter snatches her keys and begins to drive off in her car. Shelly jumps onto the windshield until Becky flings her off. The owner of the trailer park, Carl Rodd (Harry Dean Stanton), gives her a ride to the Double R Diner as she calls Bobby to explain the situation. She and Bobby meet with Becky at the diner and make arrangements to protect her from Steven. As she hugs Becky she sees her new boyfriend Red (Balthazar Getty) - a drug dealer - outside the diner and kisses him. In the thirteenth episode, Shelly is working at the Double R Diner when Becky calls her expressing concern for Steven, as she hasn't seen him in two days. Shelly asks if she can call her later because she is working, and insists that Becky come to the diner so she can make her cherry pie. =In film= Shelly appears in the prequel films Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) and Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces, the latter just consisting of unused footage from Fire Walk With Me. In Fire Walk With Me, Shelly is first seen working at the Double R Diner, when Norma asks her to assist Laura Palmer with the Meals on Wheels deliveries. When a distraught Laura tells Shelly that she cannot do the deliveries, Shelly is left to make the deliveries on her own. Later, Leo is shown verbally and physically abusing her, and forces her to wash the kitchen floor. When Bobby calls Leo, Shelly overhears the conversation and discovers that he owes him $5,000. =In literature= Shelly is referenced in the cookbook Damn Fine Cherry Pie: And Other Recipes from TV's Twin Peaks by Lindsey Bowden. Shelly is referenced in Jennifer Lynch's novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer. Told from the perspective of Laura Palmer, she wrote that she assumed that Shelly and Bobby were having an affair and discusses sleeping with Shelly's husband, Leo Johnson. Development While the character's name is spelled Shelly in the script, some tie-in products of the time spell it Shelley, including the soundtrack album and the novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer. =Casting= M√§dchen Amick originally auditioned for the role of Donna Hayward, which ultimately went to Lara Flynn Boyle. However, the creators of the show were so impressed by her that they created the role of Shelly specifically for her. Reception In Pervert in the Pulpit: Morality in the Works of David Lynch, Jeff Johnson states that Shelly is one of the \\"salvageable characters\\" saying \\"Shelly, for instance, after so much abuse from Leo, gains a sense of self-confidence and a better self-image, giving up her scamming with Bobby and even entering the Miss Twin Peaks competition.\\" Rolling Stone praised the distinctiveness of the character, stating that \\"Shelly Johnson was further away from the show's center than almost any of them. But that's kind of the point. Yes, she extricated herself from the high-school hell that consumed Laura by dropping out and getting married to brooding, drug-running trucker Leo Johnson. But that didn't save her from drudgery, boredom, betrayal, and abuse. It just moved the venue and raised the stakes.\\" References External links * Shelly Johnson Twin Peaks card * Shelly Johnson at Twin Peaks (wiki) Category:Twin Peaks characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1990 Category:Teenage characters in film Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Shelly Johnson (Twin Peaks)"},{"id":"2458092","text":"Roy Luke Dias (born 18 October 1952) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played Tests and ODIs for Sri Lanka. An elegant and stylish right-handed batsman he played 20 Test matches and became the first Sri Lankan to hit 1,000 Test runs.http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283173.html He played representative cricket for Sri Lanka from 1979 to 1987 and became the first Sri Lankan test cricketer of any of the three distinct Sri Lankan Tamil groups (Jaffna, eastern and Negombo) in the island. International career With his 214 runs in the 1979 ICC Trophy he was an integral part of Sri Lanka's tournament victory, as he played four matches with a batting average of 71.33, scoring 214 runs. The victory meant Sri Lanka qualified for the 1979 cricket World Cup, and, surprisingly, Sri Lanka won one match in that tournament as well. Dias made a patient 50 as Sri Lanka made their way to 238 for 5, before bowling India out for a meagre 191. Sri Lanka was promoted to Test status three years later, and Dias was picked for the first Test. He had a difficult start, being dismissed for a duck by Bob Willis as Sri Lanka fell to 11 for 2, but battled better in the second innings against England's spinners Derek Underwood and John Emburey. He made 77, but when he departed and the third wicket fell, Sri Lanka fell apart from 140 for 3 to 175 all out, and England chased 171 to win with relative ease. Indeed, Sri Lanka's first Test matches were promising, but in the end it often ran away from them at crucial moments. An example of this would be Dias' third Test, which was the second Test of three in Pakistan. Batting first, Sidath Wettimuny and Dias added 217 for the second wicket, then a Sri Lankan record partnership for any wicket. That enabled Sri Lanka to be on top, leading by 184 on first innings, but they could not bowl out Pakistan and had to settle for a draw. Sri Lanka went on to lose the series 0‚Äì2, despite Dias recording a career best 109 in the Third Test. Dias continued to make big scores, enjoying a personally good tour of India in September 1982, where he made his only two ODI centuries, with scores of 39, 102 and 121 in the three-match series. However, India won the series 3‚Äì0 after relatively convincing victories. Sri Lanka also played a Test match, and Dias made two fifties as he and Duleep Mendis cooperated to draw the match. At the 1983 Cricket World Cup, Sri Lanka only won one match, and Dias contributed with his only fifty of the series. Pairing up with 80 for the third wicket with Brendon Kuruppu, Dias anchored the chase to 182, ending with 64 not out as Sri Lanka won by three wickets. Sri Lanka continually improved, at least in Test cricket, but Dias' career went the other way. He made few big scores in Tests, but he made quite a few fifties in losing causes in ODIs. Then, in September 1985, India came to tour ‚Äì a tour which was Sri Lanka's biggest success to date. In the first Test, Dias made 4 and 0, yet Sri Lanka dominated thanks to centuries from Ranjan Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga ‚Äì India, however, survived out the five days and the match ended in a draw. However, in the second Test, Dias came in with the score 109 for 2 and made a stroke-filled 95 to lift Sri Lanka to 385. Then, India were bowled out for 244, and trailing by 141, but Dias scored a quick unbeaten 60 as Sri Lanka declared on 206 for 3, setting India 348 in a day. Despite 78 from Kapil Dev, India were bowled out by 198, and Sri Lanka recorded their first Test victory. Dias then recorded his third and last Test century in the third Test, as Dias survived for five hours with Duleep Mendis to save a draw and a series victory. After this, Dias' career took a turn for the worse. He only passed 50 in Tests once again ‚Äì in a drawn Test with India were 1096 runs were scored for the fall of only 17 wickets ‚Äì and poor form saw him being dropped from the ODI side after the first match in the 1987 cricket World Cup, where he scored 1. He returned for the last match of the 1987 cricket World Cup, the team having played and lost four matches without him, and while his teammates failed to pass 40 he recorded 80 in his last international innings. However, the target of 219 was all too small, and Sri Lanka ended up without a single victory in that World Cup. Coaching career Roy Dias has served as a coach for the Sri Lanka national cricket team and more recently for the Nepal national cricket team. The coaching of Dias has been instrumental in the success of the Nepali cricket team in different associate cricket tournaments. Dias also Coached plate winning Sri Lanka U19 team in the 2018 U19 Cricket World Cup. Dias also worked as the coach of Malaysia national cricket team 2012.

It is also known as the Himalayan blue bear, Himalayan snow bear, Tibetan brown bear, or the horse bear. In Tibetan, it is known as Dom gyamuk. 1917 photo of two Tibetan bear cubs One of the rarest subspecies of bear in the world, the blue bear is rarely sighted in the wild. The blue bear is known in the West only through a small number of fur and bone samples. It was first classified in 1854. Taxonomic history The Gobi bear is sometimes classified as being of the same subspecies as the Tibetan blue bear; this is based on morphological similarities, and the belief that the desert-dwelling Gobi bear represents a relict population of the blue bear. However, the Gobi bear is sometimes classified as its own subspecies, and closely resembles other Asian brown bears. Range and habitat It is possible that the occasional specimen might be observed traveling through high mountain peaks during times of reduced food supply, or in search of a mate. However, the limited information available about the habits and range of the blue bear makes such speculation difficult to confirm. Conservation status Mrs. Yvette Borup Andrews (wife of Roy Chapman Andrews) feeding Tibetan Bear cub in 1917 The exact conservation status of the blue bear is unknown, due to limited information. However, in the United States trading blue bear specimens or products is restricted by the Endangered Species Act. It is also listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a protected species. It is threatened by the use of bear bile in traditional Chinese medicine and habitat encroachment. Cultural references The blue bear is notable for having been suggested as one possible inspiration for the yeti. A 1960 expedition to search for evidence of the yeti, led by Sir Edmund Hillary, returned with two scraps of fur that had been identified by locals as 'yeti fur' that were later scientifically identified as being portions of the pelt of a blue bear.\\"Gen√®ve: 15 000 francs pour une peau de y√©ti\\" D√©tail du lot n¬∞ 872\\" References External links * Category:Carnivorans of Asia Category:Mammals of Tibet ","title":"Tibetan blue bear"},{"id":"2458106","text":"G«îw√©n or Ku-wen (Âè§Êñá \\"ancient writing\\") may refer to: * one of the two additional forms included in the Shuowen Jiezi, an ancient Chinese dictionary * Chinese characters, ancient forms ** Chinese bronze inscriptions ** Oracle bone script ** Seal script * Old Texts, versions of Chinese classics held to have been transcribed from recovered manuscripts * Classical Chinese, the language of the classic literature of ancient China ** Classical Chinese grammar * Classical Prose Movement of the Tang and Song dynasties in China * Guwen Guanzhi, an anthology of essays written in literary Chinese ","title":"Guwen"},{"id":"2458114","text":"Night of the Living Drag Queens is the second full-length release by North Carolina punk band the Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13.

It was intended to be a darker entry in the Mega Man X series. Mega Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western-designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X's new design. It was intended to be the first of a trilogy of games, where players controlled its protagonist X in the first two games and then as Zero for the third. The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier Mega Man X titles. It had a lifespan of about six months in 2010 before it was ultimately cancelled due to internal disagreements around the same time as Inafune departed from Capcom and other Mega Man titles were cancelled. Its design, which critics described as \\"gritty\\" and \\"dark\\", produced polarized opinions from fans, critics, and Capcom staff alike. MTV.com's Clint Mize criticized the art style, potential gameplay problems, and the risk associated with competing with first-person shooter games such as Call of Duty, Halo, and Battlefield. Despite the mixed opinion among fans, a fan-led Facebook group and Change.org petition were created called \\"Operation Maverick Hunter\\", which was intended to convince Capcom to revive the project. Granov expressed disappointment with its cancellation. Concept and development Keiji Inafune was responsible for initiating the collaboration between Capcom and Armature Studio on Maverick Hunter. Maverick Hunter was in development by Armature Studio and was to be published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series. The collaboration was established by Keiji Inafune, who had previously worked on the Mega Man series as an artist and producer. He had since rose in the ranks at Capcom to become a producer. The goal was to attract a new audience to the Mega Man series. Its development would have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd. The redesign for the Mega Man character was to be done by Adi Granov (the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name). An initial concept design showed X with a red glowing 'X' on his face. Unlike other Mega Man X titles, Maverick Hunter was a first-person shooter. The genre was chosen in response to the rising interest in first-person shooter games in the west. The gameplay would have adhered to core Mega Man X concepts; the ability to take and utilize the powers of enemies, his dash, and his X-Buster were all to be redesigned. His weapon designs were made to be more realistic than earlier Mega Man X titles. Instead of his arm transforming into a cannon, his armor transforms to create a gun. Additionally, his charged attack would launch a missile instead of launching a larger energy blast. Melee attacks would cause the game to switch to a third-person perspective for the attack. X's ability to steal abilities from others would have been expanded to allow the combination of abilities and the use of temporary weapons, such as bombs or tank turrets, from fallen enemies. The stolen abilities could also be used to exploit weaknesses in certain enemies. Platform elements such as his wall jump from the Mega Man X games would have been \\"re-imagined in new ways.\\" The game was also planned to have branching paths and upgrades to find throughout. Maverick Hunter was going to build upon the mythology and feature characters from the original Mega Man X titles. Capcom Japan was responsible for the design of key story points and twists while the overall plot would be handled by Armature Studio. A source familiar with the game stated that the game would \\"be like taking an 8-bit game that doesn't have a very deep story to it, and then building around it and keeping some of the key pieces intact.\\" Both Mega Man X and Zero would be featured alongside a new human sidekick who is a \\"Bruce Willis-like police officer.\\" The inclusion of the human sidekick was part of the game's \\"man versus machine contrast.\\" It was to be the first of a trilogy of games; players would control X in the first two games while they would switch to Zero in the third game, who must destroy X (who had become \\"incredibly powerful and infinitely intelligent over the course of two games\\"). =Cancellation= It was ultimately cancelled before it was revealed to the public as one of several recent cancellations in the Mega Man series (including Mega Man Legends 3, Mega Man Universe, and Mega Man Online). Its lifespan lasted for about six months in 2010, and was prototyped and playable. Despite positive internal reception, Capcom deemed it a \\"significant gamble\\" and cancelled it. Its cancellation coincided with Inafune's departure from Capcom. The playable version of the game was intended to be a proof of concept more so than a real game. Capcom senior vice president Christian Svensson noted that the game was the subject of \\"very polarized opinions internally.\\" Granov expressed disappointment over the cancellation and stated that he was \\"very happy\\" with his design work. Inafune collaborated again with Armature on the 2016 game ReCore. Reception The response from critics and fans alike has been mixed. Despite the mixed fan reaction, a fan-led Facebook group and Change.org petition intended to revive the project was created called \\"Operation Maverick Hunter\\". Michael McWhertor and Wes Fenlon felt that - with the information available - the game seemed like a \\"formula for success.\\" They compared the direction to that of Metroid Prime by developer Retro Studios (which Armature Studio spun off from). Thomas Whitehead was also positive about it; he stated that it could have been a \\"bold, exciting new direction for the franchise.\\" Joystiq's JC Fletcher noted that while Mega Man X didn't need a \\"gritty\\" reboot, it is a better alternative than to have no Mega Man games. Tony Ponce compared the redesign of X to that of Bomberman in Bomberman: Act Zero. He also stated that it was a Mega Man X game \\"in the very loosest sense.\\" He felt that the cancellation was for the best and that a \\"cold, gritty first-person shooter\\" was not the ideal direction for the series. He compared it to Metroid Primes design by noting that the art style did not change much while X's redesign was \\"virtually unrecognizable.\\" He later commented that an early concept design by Adi Granov was \\"not that bad\\" if it had no relation to the Mega Man X series. Chris Carter felt that while he didn't think the series needed a \\"gritty reboot\\", he would have enjoyed it if it was good. Clint Mize wrote an article for MTV.com's gaming section detailing why Maverick Hunter was a terrible idea. He felt that it could have turned off \\"core fans\\" of the Mega Man X series and that X required a \\"solid core title to reintroduce the character\\" rather than a \\"dark reimagining\\". He added that the decision to make it a first-person shooter made it feel like it was the product of an \\"out of touch executive\\". He also criticized it due to the risk involved in competing with big FPS games such as Call of Duty, Halo, and Battlefield. He noted that the perspective introduces other problems, such as reduced emphasis on platform segments. Its art design and gameplay have been compared to the video game Vanquish.

A studio set up for home recording is called a project studio or home studio. Home recording is practiced by indie bands, singer-songwriters, hobbyists, podcasters, documentarians, and even top-name acts. The cost of professional audio equipment has been dropping steadily in recent years, and information about recording techniques has become increasingly available due to the internet. These trends have resulted in a dramatic increase in the popularity of home recording and a shift in the recording industry toward recording in the home studio. Studio equipment Until the late 1970s, music could be recorded either on low-quality tape recorders or on large, expensive reel-to-reel tape machines. Due to their high price and specialized nature, reel-to-reel machines were only practical for professional studios and wealthy artists. In 1979, Tascam invented the Portastudio, a small four-track machine aimed at the consumer market. With this new product, small multitrack tape recorders became widely available, and grew in popularity throughout the 1980s. In the 1990s, analog tape machines were supplanted by digital recorders and computer-based digital audio workstations (DAWs). These new devices were designed to convert audio tracks into digital files, and record the files onto magnetic tape (such as ADAT), hard disk, compact disc, or flash ROM. The way the room sounds or reverberates can change dramatically the way music is mixed, written, and recorded. Untreated rooms have an uneven frequency response, which means that any mixing decisions being made are being based on a sound that is ‚Äòcoloured,‚Äô because sound mixers can not accurately hear what is being played. Acoustic panels and bass traps can improve the sound in the room.  Impact on professional recording studios  Professional recording studios have been heavily impacted by the growth of home studio technology over the last two decades. The advancements in such technology along with the moderate to low budgets of up- and-coming and even established artists have put many commercial studios out of business. Many professional engineers have moved from these commercial studios into their own homes to be able to work with their clients at a more accessible cost. Artists have also set up their home studios to self-record and produce their own material and not have to deal with high budgets and expensive studio time. Lack of album sales in recent years and major record labels cutting their budgets to fund their artists and producers to record in these high end studios have done a significant amount of damage as well. Some of music's iconic studios have been forced to shut their doors for good due to these circumstances. The list of these studios include The Hit Factory, which was located in New York City and home to albums such as Born in the U.S.A by Bruce Springsteen and Graceland by Paul Simon, and Sony Music Studios, which was also located in New York City and where Nirvana recorded their MTV Unplugged session. Another studio that was forced to close was Olympic Studios in London where works by Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones were recorded. Even though these commercial studios are able to produce a quality recording for the artists that record in them, many of the recording software used in home studios can emulate what the consoles and tape recorders are able to do. As mentioned in the Los Angeles Times, according to NAMM, the trade group for music retailers and manufacturers: \\"The total computer music market went from just under $140 million in sales in 1999 to almost a half- billion dollars in 2008\\". So while album sales have significantly dropped in the past decade, which has forced recording studios to cut costs, the sales of computer software and technology related to music have significantly increased as well. Maureen Droney, senior director of the Recording Academy's Producers & Engineers Wing, spoke to the Los Angeles Times and reflected on what the recording studios have come to be in today's music industry with the following statement: \\"In some ways we've come full circle ... We've gone back to being small and entrepreneurial. People still look to commercial studios when they have something to offer that they can't do at home. But, as it is, the recording studio business started with people starting small, funky studios, oftentimes in bedrooms and garages.\\" See also * Lo-fi music **Bedroom pop **Chillwave **Hypnagogic pop References Category:Sound recording ","title":"Home recording"},{"id":"2458123","text":"Cocibolca may refer to: * Cocibolca, the Nahuatl name of Lake Nicaragua * Cocibolca, the proper name of star HD 4208 ","title":"Cocibolca"},{"id":"2458124","text":"The Lemon technique is a method used by meteorologists using weather radar to determine the relative strength of thunderstorm cells in a vertically sheared environment.

These features include: Vertical cross-section through a supercell exhibiting a BWER. * Updraft tilt - The tilted updraft (vertical orientation) of the main updraft is an indication of the strength of the updraft, with nearly vertical tilts indicating stronger updrafts. * Echo overhang - In intense thunderstorms, an area of very strong reflectivity atop the weak echo region and on the low- level inflow inside side of the storm. * Weak echo region (WER) - An area of markedly lower reflectivity, resulting from an increase in updraft strength. * Bounded weak echo region (BWER) - Another area of markedly lower reflectivity, now bounded by an area of high reflectivity. This is observed as a \\"hole\\" in reflectivity, and is caused by an updraft powerful enough to prevent ice and liquid from reaching the ground. This powerful updraft is often an indication of, or is facilitated by, a mesocyclone. A mesocyclone is not strictly necessary for BWER development. Storm rotation can be reliably detected by the Doppler velocities of a weather radar.

It was founded as The Midland Daily Telegraph in 1891 by William Isaac Iliffe, and was Coventry's first daily newspaper. Sold for half a penny, it was a four-page broadsheet newspaper. It changed its name to the Coventry Evening Telegraph on 17 November 1941, and then the Coventry Telegraph on 2 October 2006 (which reflected its switch to morning publication). The newspaper became a part of the then Mirror Group (prior to its merger with Trinity to become Trinity Mirror), in 1997. In April 2015, the publication had a paid daily circulation of just over 18,000 copies.http://www.abc.org.uk/Certificates/47761500.pdf Trinity Mirror is now known as Reach plc. Historical copies of the Coventry Telegraph, dating back to 1914, are available to search and view in digitised form at the British Newspaper Archive.Digitised copies of the Coventry Telegraph History The only day the newspaper was unable to publish was 15 November 1940, owing to the blitz raid on the city. From 1946 until the end of April 2004, a separate sports publication, The Pink, was printed every Saturday evening. It provided coverage of sport from the Midlands, as well as national and international sport. The fortunes of Coventry City F.C. played a prominent role in The Pink'. With the 1998-99 football season, The Pink became the first regional evening newspaper to provide same day reports from all FA Premiership matches. In 2016, Coventry Telegraph launched a new weekly podcast, centred around goings on at Coventry City F.C., titled 'The Pink'. The headquarters for a significant period of the paper's history was at 157 Corporation Street, Coventry, CV1 1FP. The foundation stone was laid by the then proprietor, Lord Iliffe G.B.E, on 21 November 1957. In the 1970s, the Evening Telegraph had a regular consumer page called Watchdog, which was edited by Ken Burgess. Subsequently, the BBC used the same name for what became its long-running Watchdog series. In 1985, the local independent radio station (then known as Mercia Sound) and the Telegraph formed the Snowball Appeal, a charitable organisation whose aim is to raise money to help sick and needy children in Coventry and Warwickshire. After 96 years of ownership by the Illife Family, American Ralph Ingersoll II bought the controlling interest of the Iliffe family's newspapers. However, in 1991, the managing director, Chris Oakley, led a management buy-out creating Midland Independent Newspapers. In 1997, Midland Independent Newspapers was sold for ¬£297 million to Mirror Group. In 1999, Mirror Group merged with the regional newspaper group Trinity. From 2 October 2006, the publication changed from an evening paper to a morning paper. To reflect this change, the newspaper's name changed to Coventry Telegraph. The switch to a morning paper saw a change in emphasis with the printed edition concentrating on exclusive and community news, leaving breaking news to its website. In the summer of 2012, the paper moved its headquarters to Thomas Yeoman House at Coventry Canal Basin, in Leicester Row. The decision by the proprietors was a consequence of the changing patterns of work at the paper (and the industry in general). With the number of staff reduced and no longer needing the space for the discontinued printing presses, it was decided that a smaller, more modern headquarters was now necessary. In May 2017 the Corporation Street site was opened to the public so they could view it almost as it had been left when it closed. When the exhibition ends in July 2018 Complex Developments Ltd hope to turn the buildings into a 100-bed hotel. In the summer of 2014, the newspaper began a social media campaign entitled #bringCityhome, which helped ensure Coventry City F.C.'s return to the city following their exile at Sixfields in Northampton. The campaign drew praise from national media and figures within the football world. It was shortlisted at the Press Gazette British Journalism Awards 2014 in the Campaign of the Year category and Simon Gilbert, who spearheaded the campaign, was nominated for Sports Journalist of the Year.

They consist of a cricket pitch (natural or artificial) enclosed by netting on either side, behind, and optionally above. The bowling end is left open. Nets stop the cricket ball travelling across the field when the batsman plays a shot. They save practice time and eliminate the need for fielders or a wicket-keeper. They allow more people to train at once, particularly when they have several lanes. They allow solitary batting practice when used with a bowling machine.  Use  Nets are fundamental to cricket practice and are used at every level of the game. Professional cricket clubs are likely to have over 10 lanes of nets, and be able to practice both indoors and outdoors. Nets are also very prevalent in educational establishments, as they allow safe and efficient training with a high volume of pupils when there are significant time constraints. Keen cricketers may have nets in their gardens. Nets helps safe practice. By containing most aerial cricket balls, they reduce the potential for injury of bystanders. However, the nets need an opening for the bowler, so it is still common for balls to leave the nets, and shouts of heads up are commonly heard.  Types  Indoor and outdoor cricket nets differ significantly. = Indoor = Indoor cricket nets Indoor nets are often suspended on a track (runner) fixed to the ceiling of the sports hall or gymnasium no. The nets can drop 4-8 metres to the ground, and be over 20 metres long. Indoors nets are commonly multi-lane, with two- or four-lane nets being particularly common. Indoor nets tend to be white. They have separate 3-metre-high canvas screens that enclose the area immediately surrounding the batsman, for two reasons. First, the netting near the batsman has by far the highest work rate, and canvas is significantly more durable than mesh netting, so screens improves the nets' lifespan. Second, the batsman is less likely to be distracted. Indoor nets can be suspended on runners, providing a curtain system where they can be pulled in and out of use. This allows the sports facility to be flexible in its use. = Outdoor = Outdoor nets are the most common form of practice nets. They take many forms, with some being homemade whilst others are professional manufactured and installed. The design and construction of outdoor nets tends to be based around two factors: the frequency and age of those who will use them, and the available space. In schools and cricket clubs where use will be high, construction will be tailored to that. The nets may also need safeguards against misuse or vandalism. Therefore, the frame is often constructed out of heavy-duty galvanised steel tube with an overall diameter ranging from 34 to 50 mm. The tube is then joined by key-clamp brackets. This system requires permanent concrete ground sockets, but the actual frame of the cage can still be dismantled and removed. Outdoor nets can be fitted with wheels to be completely mobile. There are variations in the design of outdoor nets such as use of pulley system where the netting is mounted on a cable that spans posts located at either end. Garden nets are frequently home-made, often to a professional design with locally sourced components. This saves money, and cricket nets have a simple design and purpose, so are not difficult to make. Nets should be no less than 9 ft wide, with 12 ft being optimum. If the nets are under 24 ft long, they should be at least 9 ft high; if under 36 ft long, at least 100 ft high; and 12 ft high if longer than that. This prevents balls ending up on the roof of the nets when bowled. The length is less critical, but the longer the safer.  Netting  Netting is the most important component. The netting twine is usually made of a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, which is hardwearing and relatively cheap. Before about 1995, nets were often made from nylon, but this became too expensive. Nets are often black, green or white. The mesh gap is usually 50 mm and the twine will commonly have a diameter of 1.8 to 3.0 mm. Netting may be knotless or knotted: knotted is considered superior. The breaking strength of knotted netting is higher for the same diameter twine. Good twine will be UV stabilized and rot proof. For home-made nets, netting is the only specialist supply. Netting is seamed at its edges to prevent fraying. The seam is usually a 6 mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce wear. Also, partial canvas skirts of 0.5 m can be added to the bottom to prevent damage from wild animals. In other sports The baseball equivalent is the batting cage, though fundamentally different, as that provides complete ball containment, whereas cricket nets do not.

The most important prey was the wild reindeer. The earliest definite finds of arrow and bow date to this culture, though these weapons might have been invented earlier. The Ahrensburgian was preceded by the Hamburg and Federmesser cultures and superseded by the Maglemosian and Swiderian cultures. Ahrensburgian finds were made in southern and western Scandinavia, the North German plain and western Poland. The Ahrensburgian area also included vast stretches of land now at the bottom of the North and Baltic Sea, since during the Younger Dryas the coastline took a much more northern course than today. The culture is named after a tunnel valley near the village of Ahrensburg, northeast of Hamburg in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, where Ahrensburg find layers were excavated in Meiendorf, Stellmoor and Borneck. While these as well as the majority of other find sites date to the Young Dryas, the Ahrensburgian find layer in Alt Duvenstedt has been dated to the very late Aller√∏d, thus possibly representing an early stage of Ahrensburgian which might have corresponded to the Bromme culture in the north. Artefacts with tanged points are found associated with both the Bromme and the Ahrensburg cultures. Origin An Ahrensburg arrowhead. Ahrensburg culture belongs to a Late Paleolithic and early Mesolithic (or Epipaleolithic) cultural complex that started with the glacial recession and the subsequent disintegration of Late Palaeolithic cultures between 15,000 and 10,000 BCE. The extinction of mammoth and other megafauna provided for an incentive to exploit other forms of subsistence that included maritime resources. Northward migrations coincided with the warm B√∏lling and Aller√∏d events, but much of northern Eurasia remained inhabited during the Younger Dryas. During the holocene climatic optimum, the increased biomass led to a marked intensification in foraging by all groups, the development of inter-group contacts, and ultimately, the initiation of agriculture. The different technolithic complexes are chronologically associated with the climatic chronozones. The re-colonisation of Northern Germany is connected to the onset of the late Glacial Interstadial between Weichsel and the Dryas I glaciation, at the beginning of the Meiendorf Interstadial around 12,700 BCE. Palynological results demonstrate a close connection between the prominent temperature rise at the beginning of the Interstadial and the expansion of the hunter-gatherers into the northern Lowlands. The existence of a primary ‚Äúpioneer phase‚Äù in the re-colonisation is contradicted by proof of e.g. an early Central European Magdalenian in Poland. Today it is commonly accepted that the Hamburgian, featured by \\"Shouldered Point\\" lithics, is a techno- complex closely related to the Creswellian and rooted in the Magdalenian. Within the Hamburgian techno-complex, a younger dating is found for the Havelte phase, sometimes interpreted as a northwestern phenomenon, perhaps oriented towards the former coastline. The Hamburgian culture existed during the warm B√∏lling period, the brief Dryas II glaciation (lasting 300 years) and in the early warmer Aller√∏d period. However, the distribution of the Hamburgian east of the Oder River has been confirmed and Hamburgian culture can also be distinguished in Lithuania. Finds in Jutland indicates the expansion of early Hamburgian hunters and gatherers reached further north than previously expected. The Hamburgian sites with shouldered point lithics reach as far north as the Pomeranian ice margin. The younger Havelte phase has been proven for the area beyond the Pomeranian ice margin and on the Danish Isles after c. 12,300 BCE. The \\"Backed Point\\" lithics of Federmesser culture are usually dated in the Aller√∏d Interstadial. Early Federmesser finds follows shortly or are contemporary to Havelte. The culture lasted approximately 1200 years from 11,900 to 10,700 BCE., and is located in Northern Germany and Poland to south Lithuania. Fish-hooks were discovered in Aller√∏d layers and emphasize the importance of fishing in the Late Palaeolithic. A certain survival of late Upper Palaeolithic traditions similar to contemporary Azilian (France, Spain) becomes apparent, such as the amber elk from Weitsche that can be considered as a link to the Mesolithic, amber animal sculptures. Bromme culture sites are found in the entire southern and southeastern Baltic, and are dated to the second half of Aller√∏d and the early cold Dryas III period. The \\"classical\\" Brommian complex is typified by simple and fast, but uneconomical, flint processing using unipolar (single-platform) cores. A new development noticed in Lithuania introduced both massive and smaller \\"tanged Points\\". In Bromme culture this technology is proposed to be an innovation derived from tanged Havelte groups. As such, derivation of Bromme culture and even migration of its representatives from the territories of Denmark and northern Germany have been proposed,Egidijus ≈†ataviƒçius, The Final Palaeolithic Cultures in Lithuania Archaeologia Lituana vol. 6 (2005) although other sources hold early Bromme not to be very well defined in (late Aller√∏d) Northern Germany,Thomas Terberger, From the First Humans to the Mesolithic Hunters in the Northern German Lowlands, Current Results and Trends, in: Across the western Baltic, edited by: Keld M√∏ller Hansen & Kristoffer Buck Pedersen, Sydsj√¶llands Museums Publikationer Vol. 1 (2006), where it groups with Federmesser. Ahrensburg culture is normally associated with the Younger Dryas glacialization and the Pre-boreal period. The traditional view of the Ahrensburg culture being a direct inheritor of the Bromme culture in the late Dryas period is contradicted by new information that the Ahrensburgian techno- complex probably already started before the Younger Dryas, strengthening proposals to a direct derivation from the Havelte stage of the Hamburg culture.Egidijus ≈†ataviƒçius, Brommian (Lyngby) Finds in Lithuania (2006) Some recent finds, such as the Hintersee 24 site in southern Landkreis Vorpommern- Greifswald, would contribute to the argument of an early Ahrensburgian in northern Germany. Alternatively, flint artefacts of Bromme tanged-point groups is considered to prelude the techno-complex of the Ahrensburg culture and would point to the provenience of Ahrensburg from Bromme culture. As such, the Grensk culture in Bromme territory at the source of the Dnieper River was proposed to be the direct originator of Ahrensburgian culture.Otte M. The northwestern European plain around 18,000 BP. in Soffer O, Gamble C (eds) The world at 18,000 BP London: Unwin Hyman, 1990, Vol 1, pp. 54‚Äì68. However, the exact typological chronology of this culture is still unclear. Though associated with the Bromme complex, Grensk culture has its roots more defined in the local Mammoth Hunters' culture. Another possibility derives from the observation that on a regional scale, the Hamburgian culture is succeeded geographically as well as chronologically by the Federmesser culture, or Arch- Backed Piece Complex. The existence of a genuine Federmesser occupation in southern Scandinavia is highly controversial, and there is wide, though not unanimous, agreement that some Federmesser types constitute an integral part of the early Brommean artefact inventory. Still, Federmesser types are also often found in close association with Hamburgian assemblages (e.g. at Slotseng and S√∏lbjerg) and tentative, dating from northern Germany shows some degree of contemporaneity between the late Hamburgian Havelte sites and the Federmesser ones. Therefore, in southern Scandinavia the Federmesser may represent a brief transitory phase between the Hamburgian and the Brommean.Eriksen, B.V. Reconsidering the geochronological framework of Lateglacial hunter-gatherer colonization of southern Scandinavia. In: B.V. Eriksen & B. Bratlund (eds.): Recent studies in the Final Palaeolithic of the European plain. Proceedings of a U.I.S.P.P. Symposium. Stockholm, 14‚Äì17. October 1999. Jutland Archaeological Society Publications Vol. 39. H√∏jbjerg, pp. 25‚Äì41. This corresponds with the notion that \\"tanged point cultures\\" such as \\"Brommian\\" or \\"Bromme-Lyngby\\" appear to be based on the Magdalenian, during the Aller√∏d and were closely associated with reindeer hunting. Stellmoor Stellmoor was a seasonal settlement inhabited primarily during October, and bones from 650 reindeer have been found there. The hunting tool was bow and arrow. From Stellmoor there are also well-preserved arrow shafts of pine intended for the culture's characteristic skaftunge arrowheads of flint. A number of intact reindeer skeletons, with arrowheads in the chest, has been found, and they were probably sacrifices to higher powers. At the settlements, archaeologists have found circles of stone, which probably were the foundations of hide teepees. Scandinavia, Hensbacka group The earliest reliable traces of habitation in the northern territories of Norway and western Sweden date to the transition period from the Younger Dryas to the Preboreal. More favourable living conditions, and past experience gained through seasonal rounds, prompted increased maritime resource exploitation in the northern territories. The Hensbacka group on the west coast of Sweden exemplifies the cultural fragmentation process that took place within the Continental Ahrensburgian. Instead of new immigrations at the beginning of the Mesolithic, the discovery of deposited bones and new dating indicate that there was no (significant) break in settlement continuity. New knowledge provides aspects for a further autochthonous development, with a rapid climatic change stimulating a swift cultural change.

Background and education Cusack-Smith was the eldest son of Sir Michael Smith,1st Baronet, Master of the Rolls in Ireland from 1801 to 1806, and his first wife Maryanne Cusack, daughter of James Cusack of Ballyronan, County Wicklow. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. Legal and judicial career Cusack-Smith was called to the Irish Bar in 1788 and made Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1800. He was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer in 1801 at the remarkably early age of 35. The appointment caused some adverse comment, both because of his youth and because he was already displaying signs of eccentricity.Ball, F. Elrington \\" The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 \\" John Murray, London, 1926 In April 1805 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was an eccentric judge who offended Daniel O'Connell. O'Connell raised a motion, carried by MPs on 13 February 1834, to appoint a select committee to enquire into the conduct of Lord Smith in respect of his neglect of duty as a judge, and the introduction of political topics in his charges to grand juries. On the count of neglect, Cusack-Smith had been accused of rarely beginning his court sessions until after noon, occasionally running them until late into the night. The accusation of introducing political topics stemmed from statements made from the bench to grand juries condemning partisan agitation practices, which were themselves perceived as inflammatory due to their one-sided nature, although in fairness he was far from being the only judge to behave in this manner. On 21 February there was an important debate on the matter, and the resolution to appoint the committee was rescinded by a majority of six. Cusack-Smith was a lifelong supporter of Catholic Emancipation (his mother was a Roman Catholic), but moved from early rejection of the Act of Union to supporting it. Despite this reversal, his conscientious conduct as a judge was well thought of to the extent that he was even congratulated by voices among the Repealers movement on his escape from parliamentary inquiry. Cusack-Smith represented Lanesborough in the Irish House of Commons from 1794 to 1798. Subsequently he sat for Donegal Borough until the Act of Union in 1801. Family William Cusack-Smith added his mother's surname to his own upon her death. William Cusack-Smith married Hester Fleetwood Berry (29 Jan 1762 ‚Äì 4 Jun 1832), daughter of Thomas Berry of Eglish Castle, County Offaly. They had four children: Sir Michael Cusack-Smith, 3rd Baronet (1793‚Äì1859), Thomas Cusack-Smith, and daughters Frances Mary Anne and Mary Anne Angelina. Thomas Cusack-Smith followed in his grandfather's footsteps to become Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Like his father, Thomas was a notable eccentric.

At this time, reindeer was the most important prey, but the Bromme people also hunted moose, wolverine and beaver. The landscape was a combination of taiga and tundra. The culture is named after a settlement at Bromme on western Zealand, and it is known from several settlements in Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein. In Sweden, it is known from the country's earliest known settlement at Segebro, near Malm√∂. It is characterized by sturdy lithic flakes that were used for all tools, primarily awls ('), scrapers and tanged points. No stone axes have been found.

He was relatively unknown in political circles upon his appointment as prime minister in November 2004. He is affiliated with the Abgaal subclan of Mogadishu's Hawiye clan, one of Somalia's four most powerful clan 'families'. He narrowly survived a suicide attack on his home that left at least seven people dead on June 3, 2007. Biography Ali Mohamed Gedi was born in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1952. He is from the Abgaal sub-clan of the Hawiye. Gedi was raised by his paternal grandmother and later by his stepmother. Gedi's father was an officer in the military and in 1978 joined the Somali National Security Service (NSS) under the reign of Siad Barre at the rank of Colonel. Gedi studied at Jamal Abdul Nasser High School in Mogadishu, graduating in 1972. He completed military training and national service, and taught in the early 1970s. At university, Gedi excelled in his studies, and went on to the University of Pisa. He graduated in 1978, and was subsequently employed by the Somali National University (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine) as an assistant lecturer. From 1980 to 1983, he studied at the University of Pisa for postgraduate studies and obtained a Doctorate Degree in Veterinary Pathology and Surgery. He then returned to teaching in 1983 as a lecturer and headed the department until 1990.  Political reconciliation  He attended political reconciliation conferences in Mogadishu (1994 - 1996), in Cairo, Egypt (1997), in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (early 1998), in Nairobi, Kenya (late 1998), in Beledweyne, Hiiran - Somalia (1999). (Ali Mohamed Gedi, share with Abdirahman Gutale). Transitional Federal Government (TFG) =Government in exile= As head of the TFG, Gedi promised to form an inclusive government, and to strive for reconciliation among Mogadishu's warlords. After a failed assassination attempt, Gedi fled to Nairobi, Kenya. On July 2005, he moved to Jowhar, one of two towns (the other being Baidoa) being used as a temporary joint Somali capital. =Government in Baidoa= In March 2006, fighting broke out between the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (ARPCT) warlords and the Islamic Court Union (ICU) over the control of Mogadishu, which intensified in May. The conflict became known as the Second Battle of Mogadishu. The Prime Minister demanded the warlords, four of whom were members of the TFG government, to cease fighting the ICU, but this command was universally ignored and so Ghedi dismissed them from Parliament. These included National Security Minister Mohamed Afrah Qanyare, Commerce Minister Musa Sudi Yalahow, Militia Rehabilitation Minister Issa Botan Alin and Religious Affairs Minister Omar Muhamoud Finnish. =Return to Mogadishu= During December 2006, the ICU and affiliated Islamist militias suffered crucial defeats by the TFG and Ethiopian armies, who on December 29 entered Mogadishu relatively unopposed. Although Ghedi was jubilantly welcomed to the city, his Ethiopian allies faced angry crowds who pelted Ethiopian troops with rocks.\\"Mixed signals in Mogadishu\\" The New York Times, 29 December 2006. On January 1, 2007, he announced \\"The warlord era in Mogadishu is now over.\\"Somali prime minister orders complete disarmament Associated Press Ghedi's first actions included declaring martial law for three months, calling for the disarmament of the militias, and the appointment of new judges.

These programs are most frequently offered by colleges and universities that also teach standard full-time courses on campus. There are numerous Master's degree programs in a wide range of content areas; one of the most popular limited residency degree programs is the Master of Fine Arts in creative writing. The first such program was developed by Evalyn Bates and launched in 1963 at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. There are low-residency MFA programs in creative writing, visual arts, photography, and painting. Other graduate programs that can earn a student a degree include Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Business Administration, and Master of Accounting. A few schools offer limited residency undergraduate options: Goddard College, Prescott College, Lesley University, New Hampshire Institute of Art, and Union Institute & University.  Structure  Programs vary, but an intensive, low-residency model requires students to come to campus every six months for 1-2 weeks, during which time students engage in a variety of activities and lectures during the day, and create detailed study plans. During the non-residency semester periods, students study independently, sending in \\"packets\\" to their faculty mentors every month or so. The content of the packets varies with each individual, but focuses on research, writing, and reflection related to each student's individualized study plan. A few schools, such as Western State Colorado University, actually conduct live online classes via Skype each week during the non-residency periods as well as having instructors reading students' work and provide written feedback weekly.

At the time, an overland journey across the US was an arduous undertaking and could last many weeks. The Accessory Transit Company instead took passengers by steamer from New York to San Juan del Norte on the Caribbean or Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua. From there, they travelled up the Rio San Juan to Lake Nicaragua, crossing the lake to the town of Rivas. A stagecoach then crossed the narrow isthmus to San Juan del Sur, where another steamer travelled to San Francisco. The ATC provided the cheapest route to California from the east coast, and was soon carrying 2,000 passengers a month at a fare of $300 each, later reduced to $150. The wealth generated by the route attracted efforts to take it over, and in 1854 the US Navy bombarded San Juan del Norte in response to demands from the town authorities that the company vacate their premises immediately. In 1855, the filibuster William Walker installed himself as President of Nicaragua, taking over the ATC's assets in the country in the process; he was ousted in 1857 by forces backed by Vanderbilt. Having regained control of the ATC, Vanderbilt approached the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and the United States Mail Steamship Company , which operated routes across Panama, and offered to stop running the Nicaragua route in return for a $40,000 monthly stipend. The companies accepted this offer, and a year later increased the stipend to $56,000 when Vanderbilt threatened to reopen the Transit line, but the ATC did not run again. Vanderbilt's original contract with the Nicaraguan government allowing him to operate the ATC also gave him exclusive rights to construct a Nicaragua Canal until 1861. In the event, political instabilities in Nicaragua as well as its frequent volcanic eruptions conspired to make Panama a more attractive location for a trans-Central American canal.

The highway follows a southeast-northwest trajectory, running from U.S. Route 6 (US 6) in New Bedford just north of Buzzards Bay northwest to an intersection with Route 12 in Winchendon, a few miles south of the border with New Hampshire.\\"Massachusetts Atlas and Gazetteer.\\" Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. First Edition, 1998. The southern 19 miles (30 km) of Route 140 between New Bedford and Taunton is a freeway known as the Alfred M. Bessette Memorial Highway, or more commonly, the Taunton-New Bedford Expressway. Route description =New Bedford to Taunton= Route 140 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 6 (Kempton Street) and Brownell Avenue in Downtown New Bedford. This intersection is signed as exit 1 when traveling southbound on Route 140. About a mile north, Route 140 comes to its first interchange, a cloverleaf with Interstate 195, which connects Providence to Cape Cod. Route 140 then curves slightly to the right to avoid New Bedford Regional Airport, which is accessible from Hathaway Road (exit 3). Route 140 eventually leaves New Bedford and enters East Freetown, providing an exit that drops off near the center of the village. Route 140 then runs parallel to Long Pond before curving slightly west. The freeway section of Route 140 ends a few miles north at exit 12, which is for Route 24. Meanwhile, Route 140 runs along County Street towards downtown Taunton. Route 140 runs partially concurrent with Route 79 Truck in order to bypass certain sections of Route 79 proper. The two designations are concurrent from exit 10 (Route 79) to exit 12 (Route 24). At exit 12, Route 79 Truck leaves Route 140 for Route 24, where the truck route meets its parent at exit 9. =Taunton to Wrentham= From the final interchange with Route 24 in Taunton, Route 140 extends northwest towards Taunton Center, having a 0.3 mi (0.45 km) concurrency with US 44, just east of Taunton Center. As the two proceed to Taunton Green, a rotary begins with Route 140, US 44, and Route 138. Route 140 splits off from the rotary, passing the Bristol County Courthouse and heading northwest from the Green along Court Street. Route 140 brings its way through the northwest portion of Taunton, into Norton, past Wheaton College, and sharing a brief junction with MA-123. As Route 140 crosses the border from Norton to Mansfield, it passes by the Xfinity Center before reaching a junction with Interstate 495. Route 140 shares a brief stretch of highway interchange with I-495, as the route then splits off and heads north through Mansfield Center, intersecting MA-106. Route 140 crosses into Foxboro, bearing an interchange with Interstate 95, and further north a junction with US-1 North, with the US-1 South exit being another mile up the road in Wrentham. Route 140 loops through Wrentham Center, sharing a junction with Route 1A, and past King Philip Regional High School, into Franklin. Upton =Franklin to Upton= Route 140 enters Franklin from Wrentham, passing through Franklin Center, consisting of Dean College and Franklin/Dean College Station of the Franklin Commuter Rail line. Route 140 bypasses Franklin High School, and enters its second interchange with I-495 and also the second junction of the Franklin Commuter Rail line, at Forge Park/495 station, the final stop on the line. At this point, Route 140 extends west and heads into Bellingham. Route 140 spends a brief time in Bellingham, sharing a brief concurrence with Route 126, which extends north to I-495, and south into Woonsocket, Rhode Island. As Route 140 exits Bellingham, the road sharply turns north into the eastern edges of Mendon and Hopedale for a total of nearly three miles. Route 140 then enters Milford in a northwest trajectory, staying parallel to the Milford/Hopedale border for the routes duration in Milford. Route 140 enters a junction at Milford Regional Medical Center with Route 16, which leads westbound into Mendon and Hopedale Center, and eastbound to Route 85 and Route 109, both with terminations at Route 16. Route 140 enters a final small portion of Hopedale, then proceeds into the eastern part of Upton, passing through Upton Center and bypassing both Blackstone Valley Regional Technical High School and Nipmuc Regional High School. =Grafton to West Boylston= Route 140 enters Grafton through the southeast, proceeding north and sharply turning west into Grafton Center and the town common. Route 140 bears right, northward, down a mile long hill that ends at a traffic light that begins a 1.5-mile concurrency with Route 122. Routes 140 and 122 proceed north through North Grafton, passing under the Mass Pike. Immediately after crossing under the Mass Pike, Route 122 splits off to west towards Millbury and Worcester, while Route 140 begins a concurrency with the western terminus of Route 30, and heads towards Shrewsbury. The concurrency with Route 30 is a quarter-mile long, as Route 30 splits east towards Grafton Station of the Framingham/Worcester Line MBTA Commuter Rail line, Tufts Animal Hospital, and the town of Westboro. As Route 140 enters Shrewsbury it briefly becomes an undivided, high-speed wide-median route, where it meets with U.S. 20 at an overpass. Two miles later, Route 140 meets Route 9 at an underpass. Route 9 West serves as the main road into Worcester from Shrewsbury and Northboro, while eastbound heads in the direction of Westboro and towards I-495. Route 140 extends north into Shrewsbury Center, and shares an interchange with Interstate 290 at the northern edge of town. Just north of the interchange, Route 140 enters Boylston, where it meets Route 70. After Route 70, the Wachusett Reservoir is seen, and Route 140 continues northwest into West Boylston, where in the center of town begins a brief concurrency with Route 12. The two extend north for one mile, as Route 12 splits north in the direction of Sterling and Clinton, following the western terminus of Route 110, and Route 140 extends northwest into the western portion of Sterling. =Sterling to Winchendon= As Route 140 enters Sterling, there is an interchange with Interstate 190 which serves as the main source of transportation between Worcester to the south and Fitchburg to the north. Route 140 travels northwest to an intersection with Route 62 right before entering Princeton, home to Wachusett Mountain. Route 140 then joins a concurrency with Route 31 for a mile and a half, before crossing into Westminster and next to Wachusett Lake. Route 140 then meets Routes 2 and 2A at an overpass. Routes 2 and 2A run parallel with each other between Greenfield and Boston. Route 140 joins Route 2 Westbound for one exit, leaving the highway at Exit 24B. Route 140 shortly extends into Gardner. Route 140 meets with Route 101, before extending six and a half miles into Winchendon where Route 140 ends at an intersection with Route 12. Route 12 extends northwest towards Fitzwilliam and U.S. 202, which extends south to Templeton and north to Rindge, while Route 12 moves south to Ashburnham. History =Previous designation= The section of modern Route 140 from West Boylston to Gardner was numbered Route 64 when it was first commissioned by 1933. By 1939, the entirety of the route was redesignated as Route 140, effectively extending existing Route 140 northwest, which had previously ended in Grafton.Neilbert.com Home: MA 140 In 1947, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works announced plans for a \\"Relocated Route 140\\", one of the first steps as part of its statewide expressway program. Between 1955‚Äì1970 the current route was widened and straightened, while the section south of Taunton, which runs to New Bedford, was built as an expressway. The New Bedford Expressway was to serve as a spur from the Fall River Expressway, connecting to points in the Boston metropolitan area. The creation of this spur was considered a key component of revitalizing the old port city of New Bedford.http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/MA-140/ Prior to the building of the freeway section, County Street (the section of road beginning at the Taunton River, and also known as County Road) brought the road southward through East Taunton, Berkley, Lakeville and East Freetown. The road, which runs parallel to the freeway and crosses it in Lakeville, merged with Route 18 in East Freetown, just north of the New Bedford city limits. The old alignment begins in front of the Silver City Galleria in Taunton. =Highway improvements= A section of Route 140 in Franklin was widened from two to four lanes wide. The $22 million project began in 2003 and was completed in 2007. In Fall 2013, the ramp from Route 140 to I-495 south at exit 11 in Mansfield was completed. This ramp removed the need for traffic exiting the Xfinity Center in Mansfield to use a significant two-lane portion of Route 140.

The fraternity became incorporated under his auspices. Biography He was born on May 17, 1885, in Lexington, Kentucky. He initially attended Tuskegee Institute studying architectural drawing. In 1907 he graduated from Cornell University with a degree in architecture and he later became the State of New York‚Äôs first registered black architect, with offices on Broadway in New York City. Tandy's most famous commission was probably Villa Lewaro, the $250,000 mansion of Harlem millionairess Madam C. J. Walker, in Irvington on Hudson, New York. Among his other extant work are the Ivey Delph Apartments, and St. Philip's Episcopal Church at 204 West 134th Street in Harlem, through his architectural firm of Tandy & Foster. The Ivey Delph Apartments, designed in 1948, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Tandy also holds the distinction of being the first African American to pass the military commissioning examination and was commissioned First Lieutenant in the 15th Infantry of the New York State National Guard. Vertner W. Tandy died of pneumonia on November 7, 1949, aged 64, in Manhattan, New York City.

It was designed by Josef Goƒç√°r. It is currently in use as the Czech Museum of Cubism and includes the Grand Caf√© Orient restaurant on the first floor.[Grand Caf√© Orient] October 2012 Afar magazine page 117 The House of the Black Mother (U ƒåern√© Matky Bo≈æ√≠), sometimes referred to as Black Mother of the Lord, was designed and built between 1911 and 1912 on the corner of Celetn√° Street and Ovocn√Ω trh. Josef Goƒç√°r built the house as the first example of cubist architecture in Prague, and it remains probably the most celebrated. Even without historical details of the baroque building surrounding it, the House of the Black Madonna maintains the atmosphere of the neighborhood. The house was given its name by the stone sculpture that originally adorned one of the two Baroque buildings on the same lot. After many years altered use in the interwar period and under communist rule, the house was closed in January 2002 and re-opened after extensive restoration in November 2003. History Barrock building (belonging to Knights of Granov) demolished in 1911 Goƒç√°r designed the house in mid-1911 at the age of 31 for the wholesale merchant Franti≈°ek Josef Herbst. Herbst chose Goƒç√°r to build his department store in the Old Town along the old coronation route because of the architect‚Äôs earlier success with a similar shop in Jaromƒõ≈ô, built in 1909-1911. Because of its prominent location in the heart of the city, Goƒç√°r‚Äôs building was subject to strict harmonization rules requiring that the department store not conflict with its historical setting. The building thus uses the language of baroque architecture in a Cubist form, thus exemplifying the ‚Äòcontextualization‚Äô of Cubist architecture. Goƒç√°r‚Äôs first plans were not well received by the historical buildings authority in Bohemia. Subsequent designs incorporated more Cubist features into the building. The Prague City Council eventually approved the plans on August 4, 1911. Goƒç√°r‚Äôs early modernist orientation (as can be seen in the original plans for the building), gave way to new Cubist designs in the finished building. The angular bay windows, iconic capitals between windows, and cubist balcony railing took their place in the designs. Like many of Goƒç√°r‚Äôs houses, the House of the Black Madonna was built with a reinforced- concrete skeleton inspired by the Chicago School (architecture). Cubist interiors have proven a challenge to architects. The use of a reinforced- concrete skeleton allowed for large interior spaces without ceiling support that were better suited to Cubist aesthetics. The Grand Caf√© Orient, which encompassed the entire first floor without supporting pillars, was a revolutionary feat of engineering. Figure of the Black Madonna In some literature, Goƒç√°ris described as ‚Äòdecorativist‚Äô because he was primarily concerned with creating a Cubist fa√ßade instead of a Cubist building. It is thus ironic that his design for the Grand Caf√© Orient is the only surviving Cubist interior in the world. As for the fa√ßade, multiple changes in design and the requirements of harmonization forced certain compromises in the Cubist elements. The fa√ßade breaks with Cubist and modern traditions on the third storey, and incorporates 'foreign' elements in order to reconcile the building with its surroundings. For example, the roof resembles baroque double roofs, and the third storey also features flat windows and pilasters with Classical fluting between them. The House at the Black Madonna was originally designed to house a department store. Herbst‚Äôs store occupied the ground and second floor of the building. Grand Caf√© Orient was established on the first floor. Above that were apartments. Minor changes were made to this arrangement in 1914. In the mid-1920s the caf√© and store on the second floor were converted into bank offices. The department store was closed in 1922. Further alterations to the architectural integrity were made in 1941, when functionalist architect V. Kubik refashioned the wooden frames on the ground floor windows with steel. During the communist period, the building was subdivided internally into more office space and then designated the state exhibition agency. The Grand Caf√© Orient restaurant on the first floor In 1994, the building was made a center for Czech art and culture. After heavy renovation works between 2002 and 2003, the building was made home to the Museum of Czech Cubism. The fourth and fifth floors are dedicated to a permanent exhibition of Cubist art curated by the Czech Museum of Fine Arts. The exhibition focuses on Czech artists in the period from 1911 to 1919, when Cubism was in its heyday in both the visual arts and in architecture. In March 2005, the Grand Caf√© Orient was re-opened after extensive renovation works. Although only a few original plans had survived, black-and-white photographs documenting the caf√©'s interior d√©cor and atmosphere from 1912 were used during renovation. Replicas of caf√© furniture and brass chandeliers were constructed to revive the caf√© and showcase the many forms of Cubism present in the Czech republic.

It is characterized by shouldered points and zinken tools, which were used as chisels when working with antler. In later periods tanged Havelte-type points appear, sometimes described as most of all a northwestern phenomenon. Notwithstanding the spread over a large geographical area in which a homogeneous development is not to be expected, the definition of the Hamburgian as a technological complex of its own has not recently been questioned. The culture spread from northern France to southern Scandinavia in the north and to Poland in the east. In Britain a related culture is called Creswellian. A Hamburg culture shouldered point In the early 1980s, the first find from the culture in Scandinavia was excavated at Jels in S√∏nderjylland. Recently, new finds have been discovered at, for example, Finja in northern Sk√•ne. The latest findings (2005) have shown that these people travelled far north along the Norwegian coast dryshod during the summer, since the sea level was lower than today. In northern Germany, camps with layers of detritus have been found. In the layers, there is a great deal of horn and bone, and it appears that the reindeer was an important prey. The distribution of the finds in the settlements show that the settlements were small and only inhabited by a small group of people. At a few settlements, archaeologists have discovered circles of stones, interpreted as weights for a teepee covering.

A division of the blue and white wares into three \\"families\\" or broad groups has been proposed by Barbara Harrisson: \\"conservative\\", \\"persistent\\" and \\"versatile\\", in chronological order.Str√∂ber, 11, 19; Miksic, 85 This classification was further refined by Monique Crick in 2010 into three types of decoration: \\"Sketchy\\", \\"Composed\\", and \\"Full \\"rim-to-rim\\"\\".Str√∂ber, 19‚Äì21 The \\"Sketchy decoration\\" group uses \\"a vigorous, brushed style, painted freehand and spontaneously\\" by a single artisan.Str√∂ber, 19 The later groups often use drawing in dark concentrated blue to create the design, which is then overpainted with a lighter wash, in the same style that is often used with black and turquoise in the polychome enamels. Some of these pieces have visible pin pricks indicating where a stencil was fixed, presumably allowing rapid painting of the wash. The outline would have needed to dry before the wash was applied, suggesting that a number of artisans were involved in different stages of production requiring different levels of skill.Str√∂ber, 20, 25‚Äì26 The polychrome enamel wares may not have begun until the start of the 17th century, but then increased rapidly, forming about half of the Swatow pieces from the Binh Thuan wreck, which perhaps sank in 1608.Str√∂ber, 22 The dishes were given a white slip coating, and fired at the high temperature necessary for porcelain, which would have burnt the coloured enamels. They were then painted before a short second firing at about 800¬∞ C.Str√∂ber, 22 Common palettes are red, green and (rather less) yellow,Str√∂ber, 23 and turquoise, red, green and black. The black, mainly used for line-drawing, was actually made from the cobalt used for underglaze blue, in impure and concentrated form.Str√∂ber, 25 A relatively rare type is decorated in both underglaze blue and white and overglaze enamels. These pieces were expensive to produce and seem to have been made for the Japanese market.Str√∂ber, 27 An example can be seen in the wall of dishes illustrated (D5). Markets =Asia= Dish in the freehand \\"Sketchy decoration\\" style Almost no examples of Swatow ware have been excavated in China itself, other than at the actual kiln sites, and it seems the wares were, like some other types, entirely made to export. The main markets were the islands of South-East Asia, especially modern Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, together with Japan.Str√∂ber, 35 Other traditional markets for Chinese ceramics such as Korea and Vietnam seem not to be involved; they had already developed more traditional Chinese tastes favouring finely shaped monochrome wares or more delicately decorated styles. The dishes were used for display, and for dining; even royalty sat with guests on mats on the floor, eating communally from several large dishes, as early European visitors reported.Str√∂ber, 37‚Äì38 In Japan fragments have been found at prestigious castle and temple sites,Str√∂ber, 48 and it seems that the rather crude vigour of the decoration appealed to the very sophisticated aesthetic sense of some Japanese tea-masters, leaders of taste at the time. The smaller bowls and jars were more easily utilized in the Japanese tea ceremony and other contexts, and some Japanese pieces imitated Swatow shapes and decoration.Str√∂ber, 32, 48‚Äì52 A wreck off the south coast of Vietnam at Binh Thuan carried a cargo whose surviving elements were Swatow ware and cast iron woks; its excavation was published in 2004. The porcelain was about half blue-and-white and half with overglaze enamels, the latter having suffered from the extended immersion in the sea. It may well be the ship recorded as lost at sea in 1608, which the Dutch East India Company (VOC) had arranged to carry a cargo, mainly of Chinese silk, to their station at Johore in modern Malaysia, perhaps intending to trade the ceramics for spices around the Spice Islands. There were thousands of \\"medium-sized dishes\\", as well as some blue and white ones up to 42 cm across, and smaller dishes and jars. There were many designs, repeated in batches,Miksic, 44 much as in modern ceramic output, but with the designs varying from the free and presumably rapid execution.Grove =European= Detail of wall of dishes: at lower right Mount Penglai, at lower left both under- and overglaze decoration.Str√∂ber, 29, 27 European markets were probably much less significant, and the Kraak ware of the same period was probably always sent in greater quantity there. This has many similarities but was all in underglaze blue and white. The Portuguese had traded at Yuegang until expelled in 1548, but were allowed to return from 1567, and in 1577 were allowed to establish a station at Macao. The Santos Palace in Lisbon has a room decorated between 1664 and 1687 with a spectacular angled ceiling covered with Chinese blue and white porcelain dishes; three of these have been identified as Swatow ware.Str√∂ber, 41; The Porcelain Room in Santos Palace (now the French Embassy in Portugal) The Spanish, who were settled at Manila in the Philippines, carried goods including Chinese luxuries between there and New World ports such as Acapulco in the Manila galleon trade. Swatow ware has been recovered from several Spanish sites and wrecks, including Sebasti√£o Rodrigues Soromenho's San Agustin, wrecked in 1595 at Drakes Bay, just north of San Francisco.Str√∂ber, 42, 53‚Äì55 The Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602, traded with Indonesia, a major market for the wares. They were not allowed to trade directly with China, and contented themselves with capturing any Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese vessels they could, and probably arranging deliveries to their bases by Chinese ships. From 1624 they had a base on Formosa (modern Taiwan).Str√∂ber, 43‚Äì45 The rather similar export Kraak porcelain was adapted to suit European tastes, which Swatow ware never seems to have been. Later Swatow wares may have been exported directly to Europe by the Dutch.Miksic, 85 These European trades have left fragments of Swatow ware at various land sites and wrecks around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.Str√∂ber, 46, 53‚Äì55 Collections The pieces have remained appreciated in their original markets, especially in Indonesia and Japan, where there are several good collections.Str√∂ber, 50 They were generally not collected by the Chinese and most Western and Chinese museums with good collections of ceramics have sparse holdings.Str√∂ber, 4, 9‚Äì10 The Dutch Princessehof Ceramics Museum has an exceptional collection of some 170 pieces,Str√∂ber, 4 with \\"the most representative range of the type\\",Grove; see gallery though in terms of shapes it concentrates on the large dishes.Str√∂ber, 15 This was originally assembled in Indonesia by a Dutch colonial administrator in the 19th century.

A control city is a city, locality, or other location posted on a series of traffic signs along a particular stretch of road indicating destinations on that route. Together with route numbers and cardinal directions, these focal points aid the motorist navigating along a highway system. Such cities appear on signs at junctions to indicate where the intersecting road goes and where the road ahead goes. They are also typically used on distance signs. Different countries have different practices as far as focal points on directional signs are concerned, and the term control city is not used globally. Where a sign contains a number of destinations for a particular direction, not all of those destinations may be considered a control city. In most countries, control cities are perceived to be the destinations on signs that aid longer-distance traffic, as opposed to local traffic. Accordingly, local destinations on a sign, which only appear incidentally, would in a number of countries not be considered control cities.An example would be Germany, where the Richtlinie f√ºr die wegweisende Beschilderung auf Autobahnen distinguishes between Fernziele and Nahziele. While a control city may not appear on the signs of every single junction, the control city would at least appear on major junctions. Description Mostly towns and cities are used as control cities. Other than major towns in a country or region, towns close to major intersections or the end of a particular route are often selected as control city. However, all sorts of other potential destinations can be selected as control city, such as states and regions, frequently visited objects, and names of prominent intersecting roads. Narrow-passes carrying a lot of traffic often also take the role of control city. Examples would be major bridges (the Golden Gate Bridge is a control city within San Francisco), tunnels (e.g. the Holland Tunnel in New York City), or mountain passes (e.g. the Gotthard Pass featuring prominently on signs in Switzerland). In border areas, the border itself regularly features as a control city, e.g. the U.S.-Mexico border for Interstate 5 southbound. The control city is typically on or close to the route for which it serves as the primary focal point. In exceptional situations, towns along prominent intersecting roads could serve as such, notably when the vast majority of traffic would turn off to that intersecting road. Equally, towns beyond a route's terminus could serve as control city. Particularly when a route merges into another route, a major town along that other route could serve as control city. In the United States, for instance, Interstate 40 uses Los Angeles as a control city for motorists west of Flagstaff, even though I-40 does not reach Los Angeles, and neither does Interstate 15, which is at its western terminus. And suppose the U.S. state of New Mexico were to use the next major city as a control city on its interstates instead of using smaller cities/minor towns, Interstate 25 would use El Paso as a control city southbound from Albuquerque; while I-25 doesn't reach El Paso, it transitions onto I-10 which does go to that city. While the vast majority of control cities are sizeable towns, minor towns or even unincorporated localities may feature as control city. This is particularly the case if they are located close to junctions of major roads or near the terminus of a road. Major roads in Poland, for instance, feature many signs that refer to small villages close to the border, since that border marks the route's terminus. Signs in Australia's Northern Territory generally will not refer beyond the state border, with the last control city on the Stuart Highway being SA Border and the same applying on routes heading to Queensland and South Australia. On the other hand, there are also instances where larger cities have not been selected as control city because of the proximity of a bigger city downstream on the road. A common principle identified in signposting is the principle of continuity. Once a particular destination has featured on a sign, it should feature on all signs that contain forward destinations for that direction. Sometimes particular towns are used on a one- off basis at major intersections, but they would then not be considered the control city for that particular road.  Europe  Unlike in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, roads in Continental Europe are not signed with directional banners (east, west, north, and south). The motorist accordingly needs to rely on the combination of the control city and the route number as navigation tools. Possibly as a result of this, control cities (whatever they are called) tend to feature rather prominently on the route signs of European countries when compared to signage in North America. Routes tend to feature more signs that contain information for the route forward and those signs often contain a larger number of focal points. In this context, and bearing in mind that in Europe every country has its own style of signposting, the term control city is not always in use, but most countries use concepts that have a similar role to that of a control city in North America. Some, but not all, countries like Poland and Switzerland label border crossings and foreign cities as control cities with a European abbreviation symbol (D for Germany, NL for the Netherlands, UA for the Ukraine etc.). The border crossing control city in Poland would have priority over other towns along the way even if the signposted border village/town is smaller than many towns along the way. A2 autostrada of Konin, Pozna≈Ñ, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the German- Polish border crossing of ≈öwiecko. = Belgium = In Belgium, the route network very much centers around the towns of Antwerp, Brussels, and Li√®ge. On roads leading to these towns, the relevant town typically features as the primary focal point of the route and as the most distant focal point on the distance signs placed after each intersection. On other roads, provincial capitals play a comparable role as control city, while larger towns outside Belgium feature on routes leading out of Belgium. =France= Following the A1 leads to Lille and Calais, and the A2 leads to Belgium- the E19 directly to Brussels and via other routes to Li√®ge. All French localities have been divided into five categories for signposting purposes, mostly based on their size (though smaller towns with a strategic position in the road network could be promoted while larger suburban towns could be relegated one category). Towns in categories 3, 4, and 5 feature as the focal points on forward signs and distance signs of motorways. On non-motorways, these towns are signposted against a green background whereas other towns are signposted with black letters against a white background. The towns in category 5 are the biggest towns of France, which are also the pivotal points in the French motorway network. Signs on, and leading to, French motorways generally refer to some three or four towns on that motorway. In other words, there are no stand-out towns that could be referred to as the French equivalent of a control city. The towns signposted have been picked from the three categories signposted along motorways, with towns in category 5 signposted from the biggest distance out (typically, on any motorway that leads to a town in category 5, the first category 5 town ahead is signposted). =Germany= In the German guidelines for directional signage on motorways, the concept of the Hauptfernziel (translating as main distant focal point) has a role that is comparable to that of a control city in North America. This control city appears on roads leading to a motorway and at on-ramps. The Hauptfernziel is also the most distant point that features on distance signs, which are placed after each exit. Directional signage along motorways tends to also refer to towns other than the Hauptfernziel. These could be local focal points (known as Nahziele), but also smaller towns downstream. Under German guidelines, a town close to a road's terminus should serve as Hauptfernziel, except that towns close to major functions could also take that role. The major towns of Germany typically double as Hauptfernziel on this basis, notwithstanding the fact that motorways often pass by rather than terminate there. A prominent town that does not feature as Hauptfernziel on a major route would be D√ºsseldorf, which despite being a regional capital sits squeezed between the major junctions at Oberhausen and Cologne and has no major motorway junction itself. On the longer motorways of Germany, the distance between Hauptfernziele is usually some , though less in densely populated areas. Distance signs on motorways also often feature the Hauptfernziel of one or more intersecting motorways. These are separated from towns along the route proper with a horizontal line. = Ireland = In the Republic of Ireland, directional banners are used on the M50. =Italy= Road signs in Italy normally feature one focal point used per direction of a longer stretch of road. This could be considered the control city of that road. Often, this is the town close to the route's terminus, but it could also be a town close to a major intersection or an otherwise major town. Milan, for instance, has this role along the A4 between Turin and Trieste. On longer non-motorways, a provincial capital often takes the role of control city despite not being close to the route's terminus or a major intersection. Intersecting routes also feature as control city. This often occurs on beltways and spur routes. In addition to signs showing a route's single control city, Italian routes generally also feature ancillary signs that feature other towns in a particular direction. Unlike the control city, these other towns are not necessarily to be found on subsequent signs along the route signposted. These towns feature on the directional signage for information purposes only. = Netherlands = In the Netherlands, the guidelines for signposting feature a distinction between regular control cities (called hoofddoel) and network cities (called netwerkdoel). The class, a group of ten cities in each part of the country where major roads intersect, is being signposted in addition to regular control cities. The references to network control cities serve to guide long-distance traffic through the country, unlike the reference to the first regular control city which is seldom more than away. Network control cities can also be towns on an intersecting road. Since 2010, efforts are being made to create even more prominent references to the towns of Amsterdam and Rotterdam; the former drawing many tourists and the latter drawing many professional drivers to its port. On roads not leading to a network control city, the route's terminus is often signposted in addition to the control city. =Scandinavia= The E45 and E39 split at N√∏rresundby in Denmark. The overheads show the destinations and on the bottom, the distance to the nearest exit on the two freeways (). Each of the Scandinavian countries has its own style of signposting, but their styles reveal similarities. Signs on roads in the countries typically feature one town that takes the role of the control city of that particular road. As distances in Scandinavia are longer and the area is sparsely populated, this can be a town that is several hundred kilometers away. Other than local destinations, signs in Scandinavia do not commonly feature other cities in addition to this major town. On less important roads, the town featuring as control city is often the route's terminus. On the main axes of Scandinavia, notably the main North-South routes E4 and E6, larger towns along the routes have been chosen to also appear as control city. =United Kingdom= A696. In the United Kingdom, the term control city is not commonly used. Rather, motorists are referred to a primary destination. Primary destinations are typically towns located close to strategic intersections. In London and other large cities, boroughs and major intersections are also in use as primary destinations, with the financial centre itself being signposted as The City. One particular intersection outside London that made it to primary destination is Scotch Corner, the split between two routes from the South into Scotland. On signs in the United Kingdom, cardinal directions are not used, but one specific aspect of UK signage is the use of regions as a focal point along roads. These regions, which may appear a cardinal direction (e.g. the North, as appears on the A1), serve to direct long-distance traffic. Primary destinations, on the other hand, are typically relatively nearby. As directional signs typically only contain the first one or two primary destinations, traffic needs to rely on the regional focal points to see the general bearing of the route. Primary destinations that are not on the designated road are shown in brackets as in the image below: Sign in Cheshire showing the distances to the primary destinations of the M6 motorway, Warrington and Chester. None of these destinations are located on the A537 road so they are written in brackets.  North America  = Canada = Toronto signed as the control city on A20 in Montreal. Canada lacks a coherently signed national highway system‚Äîeven for the Trans-Canada Highway routes‚Äîand there is no mutual agreement for designating control cities across provincial boundaries. Control cities are particularly necessary for highways that do not follow strict linear directions. Ontario's Queen Elizabeth Way, for example, wraps around the western end of Lake Ontario, with segments proceeding both east and west at different points. Compass directions are not used and the control cities of Toronto and (for the opposite direction) Hamilton/Niagara/Fort Erie are the only bearings provided. Each of the 400-series highways uses control cities, but the common Ontario practice is to use smaller, closer urban centres as alternatives to out-of-province cities. For example, on Highway 401, Cornwall displaces Montreal as eastbound control city for most of the St. Lawrence valley. Windsor, London, Toronto, Kingston, Cornwall, and (briefly) Montreal are control cities while larger cities such as Oshawa and Mississauga are omitted due to their proximity to Toronto. The pattern of control city signage is sometimes inconsistent in Ontario. For example; while Barrie and Newmarket are signed as control cities for Highways 400 and 404 respectively, on exit signage along Highway 401, London and Kingston are not shown as control cities on signage along these highways as they approach Highway 401. Along Highway 400, the control cities of Toronto, Barrie, Parry Sound, and Sudbury are consistently signed along its southern section, but Barrie and Parry Sound are omitted in its northern section: eg; northbound, the control city changes to Sudbury even before the highway reaches Parry Sound, while Toronto is signed in two different sections southbound. The Minist√®re des Transports du Qu√©bec typically uses large urban centres as control cities, even if they are far away and/or outside the province. For example, signs in Montreal, Quebec, indicate control cities as far as Toronto and Ottawa on major Autoroutes 20 and 40 respectively. New York City and Vermont are used as control cities for Autoroutes 15 and 35 respectively. This may cause confusion to motorists unfamiliar with this convention, as the control cities change at the continuations of these autoroutes into the adjoining jurisdictions. The New Brunswick Department of Transportation tends to use cities within the province as control cities. The Trans-Canada Highway uses Edmundston, Fredericton, Moncton, and Sackville as control cities from north to south. Bordering provinces are used sparingly, and only after they are the only remaining destination on the highway. Route 95, the link between the Trans-Canada Highway and Interstate 95, uses only Houlton, Maine as a control city to the west. = United States = North of Baltimore, Maryland, New York City is used instead of closer Philadelphia or Wilmington. These signs in Petersburg, Virginia on Interstate 95 near the start of Interstate 85 aid long-distance travelers, by listing the cities of Durham, North Carolina, Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Miami, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia. U.S. Route 50 in Ocean City, Maryland is an unusual case, giving the distance to the very distant western terminus in Sacramento, California. The control cities on the Interstate Highway network are selected by the states and contained in the \\"List of Control Cities for Use in Guide Signs on Interstate Highways,\\" published and available from American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Control cities on other U.S. roads are often selected on the basis of general principles, as opposed to specific lists of towns. U.S. federal lists are in practice not always followed. This may be the result of towns having gained importance since the list was last updated or in order to have local (intrastate) interests prevail over towns elsewhere. On the other hand, there are also instances where intrastate control cities have been left out so that long- distance focal points could be added. There are also instances where the name of another state has prevailed over the official control city, e.g. the signs in Boston heading to the state of Maine (\\"All Maine Points\\" appears twice on northbound I-95 just south of Portsmouth, NH.). On the U.S. federal list, control cities have often been selected by virtue of being located close to an intersection of two US-interstates. This has resulted in a number of very minor localities having control city status. Some examples: *Interstate 8 heading eastbound in California from its starting point in San Diego signs El Centro and Yuma as control cities until the Arizona state line. This may be due to the fact that there are no cities in California or Arizona with a population of more than 200,000 that are along the freeway besides the aforementioned San Diego. On the contrary, however, its Arizona route only signs Phoenix and Tucson heading east, while San Diego is the only control city signed heading west. Phoenix lies significantly north of Interstate 8, but may be signed to aid travelers from San Diego to Arizona‚Äôs capital and largest city. It is omitted after Exit 115 heading eastbound, from where only Tucson is signed until the freeway defaults onto eastbound Interstate 10 (which eventually reaches that city). *Interstate 10 heading eastbound from its starting point to the California‚ÄìArizona state line uses the following towns as control cities: San Bernardino, Indio, and Blythe. Besides Exit 145 in Indio, there is no mention of Phoenix as a control city during this stretch of freeway despite it being the next city after San Bernardino with a population over 200,000. On the contrary, Los Angeles is used as the westbound lanes‚Äô control city as far as the eastern city limits of Phoenix until the state line. *Interstate 10 heading eastbound in El Paso uses Van Horn, Texas, a small city west of the western terminus of I-20; the junction of I-10 and US 90 is also near Van Horn. Both Van Horn and San Antonio are used, due to the latter being the next major city along the route. *Interstate 10 in Louisiana uses Lake Charles and Lafayette as control cities in both directions. In Texas, Baton Rouge was previously listed as the eastbound control city beginning in Beaumont to the Texas-Louisiana state line. Recently updated signs now list Lake Charles as the eastbound control city starting in Beaumont at the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. *From New Orleans to the Louisiana-Mississippi state line, I-10 eastbound signs list the smaller communities of Slidell, Louisiana and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi as control cities, rather than Gulfport, one of the two largest cities (with Biloxi) along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. *Interstate 49 in Louisiana uses Opelousas, a small city, as a control city northbound from Interstate 10 in Lafayette to the junction of I-49 and US 190, and southbound from Louisiana Highway 1 in Alexandria to US 190. US 190 is heavily traveled between Opelousas and Baton Rouge, even with the presence of I-10, probably the reason why Opelousas is listed as a control city. *Interstate 55 heading northbound out of LaPlace, Louisiana uses Hammond, where it crosses Interstate 12. I-12 east from its origin in Baton Rouge to I-55 uses Hammond as the control city, as does I-12 west from its ending at the I-10/Interstate 59 junction in Slidell to I-55. Hammond's use is likely due to its location of Southeastern Louisiana University, the state's third largest public university. **On Interstate 55 south in Mississippi, all signs south of Jackson list New Orleans as the control city. *Interstate 40 in Arizona uses Flagstaff eastbound from the California state line to the junction of I-40 and Interstate 17, and westbound from the New Mexico state line to I-17. This is because Flagstaff is I-17's northern terminus; I-17 north from Phoenix uses Flagstaff for the same reason as well. Flagstaff is also the gateway to the Grand Canyon National Park. *As Interstate 69 is not complete as of 2019, the northbound approaches south of Indianapolis do not have any control city, both north and south of Bloomington. Instead they simply read \\"I-69 North\\". They do, however, use Evansville as the control city on the southbound approaches. **Likewise in Kentucky, I-69 uses Henderson as a control city due to the fact of the highway currently dead-ending there until at least 2021. *Interstate 70 in Missouri often uses several intermediate towns between the large cities at opposite ends of the state along the highway, Kansas City and St. Louis. Columbia is most commonly listed due to its central location within the state and the presence of the state's flagship university, the University of Missouri. **In the St. Louis area, Indianapolis is not listed as a control city on eastbound I-70 until the highway crosses into Illinois. Also, Louisville is not listed as a control city on Interstate 64 eastbound until entering Illinois. St. Louis is the control city on I-64 westbound beginning in Louisville, and I-70 westbound beginning in Indianapolis. **In the Kansas City area, Topeka is not listed as a control city on westbound I-70 in Kansas City, Missouri until the highway enters the Downtown Loop. Conversely, St. Louis is listed as the control city on eastbound I-70 beginning with the junction at Interstate 435 in Kansas City, Kansas. *I-55 in Missouri also uses intermediate cities as control cities, notably Cape Girardeau, the largest city along the route between St. Louis and Memphis. Most I-55 northbound signs in Tennessee and Arkansas list St. Louis as the control city. *Limon, Colorado, (estimated population 1,930 in 2017) is listed as a control city along Interstate 70 in Colorado eastbound starting in Denver, and westbound starting at the Colorado-Kansas state line. For a brief time, Limon was also used as a control city for 253 miles of Interstate 70 in Kansas westbound from Salina to the state line. The control cities are now Hays from mile markers 253 to 161, and Denver from mile marker 161 to the state line. *Interstate 75 in Michigan uses the Mackinac Bridge as a control point between Sault Ste. Marie and Saginaw. *Interstate 76, Interstate 70, and PA Route 66 all use New Stanton, Pennsylvania as a control city, due to the fact that it is at PA 66's terminus as well as the beginning of the I-70/76 Concurrency. Additionally, Breezewood is used as a control city between the Interstate 76 and Interstate 70 heading to Washington, DC. However, I-70 contains a freeway gap in downtown Breezewood. *Interstate 94 in Michigan uses Marshall, Michigan as a control city between Battle Creek and Jackson. However, in many other instances, the next major city near or along the route is used as a control city, often skipping over minor localities where two US-interstates meet. For instance: * Interstate 10 in Arizona heading eastbound from Tucson to the New Mexico state line uses El Paso, Texas as a control city and skips over Las Cruces, New Mexico, a smaller city (compared to El Paso) where the southern terminus of Interstate 25 is located. * Interstate 40 in Arizona heading westbound from Flagstaff uses Los Angeles as a control city instead of Barstow, California (the western terminus of I-40 at Interstate 15) or Kingman. Interstate 15 uses Los Angeles as a control city south of Las Vegas as well. I-40 and I-15 do not go anywhere near Los Angeles, but the use of it as a control city on I-40 is probably a holdover from the days when the route was US 66 (the western terminus was in Santa Monica), and US 91 (which ended in Long Beach) for I-15, as well as the fact that most of the California bound traffic on I-40 and I-15 are headed to the Los Angeles area. * Interstate 20 in Texas heading westbound from Midland‚ÄìOdessa to its western terminus at Interstate 10 uses El Paso as a control city, as does I-10 west from San Antonio. I-20 doesn't travel all the way to El Paso but merges into I-10. * Interstate 8 in Arizona uses Tucson as a control city eastbound from Yuma to Casa Grande, where it defaults onto Interstate 10. Phoenix is also used but between Yuma and Gila Bend; this is because travelers headed to Phoenix take AZ 85 from Gila Bend to I-10. * Interstate 84 east from Hartford, Connecticut to its terminus at Interstate 90 near Sturbridge, Massachusetts uses Boston. * Interstate 90 in Washington does not use Ellensburg, Washington as a control city between Spokane and Seattle. * Interstate 5 in Washington uses Portland, Oregon as the southbound control city from Seattle to the Oregon state line (skipping over Tacoma and Olympia). * Interstate 80 in Ohio heading eastbound from Cleveland uses New York City as a control city instead of the 10 listed municipalities in Pennsylvania and the Delaware Water Gap. Some beltways or spurs which run through multiple states have different rules on control cities in each state. One instance is Interstate 435, the beltway in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. Signs for I-435 in Kansas do not have control cities listed, while in Missouri, one of five control cities is listed, depending upon direction and location: Des Moines, St. Joseph, St. Louis, Topeka and Wichita. Under the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, control cities must appear on the route signs: #At interchanges between freeways (example US-1 in gallery) #At separation points of overlapping freeway routes (example US-2 in gallery) #On directional signs on intersecting routes, to guide traffic entering the freeway (example US-3 in gallery) #On pull-through signs (example US-4 in gallery) #On the bottom line of post-interchange distance signs (example US-5 in gallery) Since the towns on post-interchange distance signs are listed in ascending order of distance, the control city of routes in the United States is typically the most distant locality on the signs of a particular road.  Oceania  = Australia = Freeways in Australia, while not using the term 'Control City', operate on much the same system as in the United States and Europe. Directional markers are not used, instead the next large towns or cities which are likely to be the destination, or known waypoints for motorists, are used. *Within cities major suburbs will usually be used - In the eastern suburbs of Melbourne Chadstone & Dandenong, which are connecting hubs with the national route 1, Princes Highway, are used as route markers. Traveling inbound, depending upon the driver's location in Melbourne's east one of these markers will generally be used along with a marker 'City' referring to the Central Business District. The marker 'City' is only used when within the metropolitan area of a city, outside of the metropolitan area routes traveling towards that city will use the city's full name. *Outside of cities, major regional centers or capital cities will generally be used as markers. *The same principle applies to major and secondary surface roads in Australia, with the most major suburb or town, or the road's terminus in either direction being used as the 'control city'. On the main routes connecting Australia's major cities, the next interstate capital is often used signposted in addition to the next regional centre. The Northern Queensland town of Cairns has a similar status. *In some circumstances a major infrastructure location, most often Airports, will be used as a 'Control' City. In the case of surface roads if they connect to a freeway, motorway or tollway sometimes this connection will be used as a signing point. Guidelines to control city selection There is no absolute threshold of community size or distance away, or absolute necessity that it has to be a city per se in order to be selected. Even some highways will terminate several miles before the so-called \\"control city\\" and \\"borrow\\" another route to continue toward there, even if a north‚Äìsouth highway has to externalize its control city to an east‚Äìwest highway. For instance, Interstate 75 in Michigan uses the Mackinac Bridge as a \\"control city\\", and even U.S. Route 127 in Michigan does it as far south as Mt. Pleasant. Another idiosyncrasy with control cities is there is no absolute rule that the city has to be reached before the control city changes, for instance Interstate 94 in Michigan uses Chicago as a control city as far as the Metro Detroit area, whereas some in-between cities such as Jackson are used within of there. Other control cities are used where a city can be several miles east of a north- south route, such as U.S. Route 35 using Charleston, West Virginia, as a control city even though the southern junction is at Scott Depot, West Virginia, in which Interstate 64 goes east toward Charleston. Another example is Interstate 65, as Chicago, Illinois is used as a control city north of Indianapolis, Indiana, but I-65 terminates at Interstate 90 and the Indiana Toll Road in Gary, Indiana, 26 miles southeast of Downtown Chicago, and I-90 goes northwest into Chicago via the Toll Road, Chicago Skyway Bridge and Dan Ryan Expressway. In the case of concurrencies, another control city from the overlapping highway can take over, and sometimes two locations are used together. Other idiosyncrasies involve forcing a control city to be within the state or province. For instance Ontario highway 401 uses Kingston, Ontario as a control city, even though Montreal in the neighboring province is bigger, though it is not too far from Kingston either. This tactic, however, forces cities within the province to represent the majority of the length so as to not have much distance of remainder to the control city in the neighboring province.

Gudrun had been the wife of the hero Sigurd, whom her brothers had killed. With Sigurd she had had the daughter Svanhild, who had married to the Goth king Ermanaric (J√∂rmunrekkr). Ermanaric had Svanhild trampled to death by horses, due to which Gudrun wants vengeance, and she agitates her sons (see Jonakr's sons) from a later marriage to kill Ermanaric, cf. Gu√∞r√∫narhv√∂t. The poem is considered to belong to the oldest of the heroic poems, probably from the 9th century. It makes an archaic impression with its bitter and laconic language. Howling with wrath, the brothers Hamdir and S√∂rli ride over a misty mountain. The last lines are like carved on a runestone: Sources and historic basis The legend of J√∂rmunrek appears in the Poetic Edda as Ham√∞ism√°l and Gu√∞r√∫narhv√∂t. It also appears in Bragi Boddason's Ragnarsdr√°pa, in the V√∂lsunga saga and in Gesta Danorum. Jordanes wrote in 551 that the Gothic king Ermanaric was upset with the attack of a subordinate king and had his wife Sunilda (i.e. Svanhild) torn to pieces by horses, and as revenge Ermanaric was pierced with spears by her brothers Ammius (Hamdir) and Sarus (S√∂rli) and died from the wounds. The Annals of Quedlinburg (end of the 10th century) relates that the brothers Hemidus (Hamdir), Serila (S√∂rli) and Adaccar (Erp/Odoacer) had cut off the hands of Ermanarik.

It is often simply referred to as the Hypogeum (), literally meaning \\"underground\\" in Greek. The Hypogeum is thought to have been a sanctuary and necropolis, with the remains of more than 7,000 people documented by archeologists, and is among the best preserved examples of the Maltese temple building culture that also produced the Megalithic Temples and Xagƒßra Stone Circle.  History  The Hypogeum was discovered by accident in 1902 when workers cutting cisterns for a new housing development broke through its roof. The workers tried to hide the temple at first, but eventually it was found. The study of the structure was first conducted by Manuel Magri, who directed the excavations on behalf of the Museums Committee, starting from November 1903. During the excavations, a portion of the contents of the Hypogeum, including grave goods and human remains, were emptied out and discarded without being properly catalogued. To confound things further, Magri died in 1907 while conducting missionary work in Tunisia and his report on the Hypogeum was lost. Excavation continued under Sir Themistocles Zammit, who attempted to salvage what he could. Zammit began publishing a series of reports in 1910 and continued excavating until 1911, depositing his findings at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. The Hypogeum was first opened to visitors in 1908 while the excavations were ongoing. The four houses built on the site of the hypogeum were demolished to build the museum.https://culture.gov.mt/en/culturalheritage/Documents/form/MAR1991.pdf Real attempts to preserve the site started in 1991 when it closed for a decade to arrange it for visits. In 2011, a more intensive program was launched to monitor the decay of the site.Stacey McKenna, Malta‚Äôs Hypogeum, One of the World‚Äôs Best Preserved Prehistoric Sites, Reopens to the Public, Smithsonianmag.com, 23 May 2017 The Hypogeum reopened in May 2017 after closing for a year to improve its environmental management system. Description Site map of the Hypogeum made in October 1907 Later archeological excavations indicate there was once a surface shrine that marked the entrance to the Hypogeum, with its subsequent destruction likely shielding the lower structure from discovery for thousands of years. Nothing remains of any potential enclosure that would have marked the entry to the Hypogeum. The underground structure may have originated from a natural cave, expanded over time by cutting directly into the rock with crude tools including antlers, flint, chert and obsidian. Burial chambers in the upper level of the Hypogeum date from the early phases of the Maltese Temple Period, with lower chambers dating from later. The site may have first been used as early as 4000 BC, and was likely used until around 2500 BC, based on pottery sample analysis and examination of human remains. The temple structure uses a careful direction of light from the surface to penetrate into the lower chambers, with intricate patterns painted on portions of the ceiling with red ocher, following motifs of spots, spirals and honeycombs. One of the main chambers, called \\"The Holy of Holies\\", appears to be oriented such that light from the winter solstice illuminated its facade from the original opening above. A resonance niche cut in the middle chamber, called the Oracle Room, was possibly designed to project chanting or drumming throughout the rest of the Hypogeum.Mysterious Ancient Temples Resonate at the 'Holy Frequency', Interestingengineering.com, 1 December 2016 The Sleeping Lady of ƒ¶al Saflieni, National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta A broad range of objects were recovered from the site, including intricately decorated pottery vessels, stone and clay beads, shell buttons, amulets, axe-heads, and carved figures depicting humans and animals. The most notable discovery was the Sleeping Lady, a clay figure thought to represent a mother goddess. The figures range from abstract to realistic in style, with major themes thought to be related to veneration of the dead and spiritual transformation. Complex artistic techniques are also represented, as in the case of a single large pottery bowl which utilized both naturalistic and stylized themes, with one side realistically depicting bovines, pigs and goats, and the other side representing hatched animals hidden within complex geometric patterns. The remains of some 7,000 individuals were found in the Hypogeum, and though many of the bones were lost early in excavation, most of the skulls were deposited at the National Museum. A small percentage of the skulls have an abnormal cranial elongation, similar to priestly skulls from Ancient Egypt, fueling speculation about the people who occupied the Hypogeum, and their practices and beliefs. Further excavations took place between 1990 and 1993 by Anthony Pace, Nathaniel Cutajar and Reuben Grima. The Hypogeum was then closed to visitors between 1991 and 2000 for restoration works; and since its reopening, Heritage Malta (the government body that looks after historical sites) allows entry to only 80 people per day, while the site's microclimate is strictly regulated. Scientific research on the Hypogeum is ongoing, and in 2014, an international team of scientists visited to study acoustics.  Structure  Limestone doorways The Hypogeum is constructed entirely underground and consists of three superimposed levels hewn into soft globigerina limestone, with its halls and chambers interconnected through a labyrinthine series of steps, lintels and doorways. The upper level is thought to have been occupied first, with the middle and lower levels expanded and excavated later. Some of the middle chambers appear to share stylistic characteristics with the contemporaneous Megalithic Temples found across Malta. = Upper level = The first level is only ten metres below the surface, and it is very similar to tombs found in Xemxija, near St. Paul's Bay. Some rooms are natural caves which were later artificially extended. This level consists of many chambers, some of which were used for burial. = Middle level = The second level is a later expansion, with the rock hoisted up to the surface by Cyclopean rigging. This level features several noted rooms: The Holy of Holies *Main Chamber: This chamber is roughly circular and carved out from rock. A number of trilithon entrances are represented, some blind, and others leading to another chamber. Most of the wall surface has received a red wash of ochre. It was from this room that the Sleeping Lady was recovered. *Oracle Room: This is roughly rectangular and one of the smallest side chambers. It has the peculiarity of producing a powerful acoustic resonance from any vocalization made inside it. This room has an elaborately painted ceiling, consisting of spirals in red ochre with circular spots and spirals. *Decorated Room: Near the Oracle Room is another spacious hall, circular, with inward slanting smooth walls, richly decorated in a geometrical pattern of spirals. On the right side wall of the entrance is a petrosomatoglyph of a human hand carved into the rock (Agius). *Holy of Holies: Perhaps the central structure of the Hypogeum, this room appeares to be oriented toward the winter solstice, which would have illuminated its facade from the original surface opening. No bones were recovered from this room during excavations. The focal point is a porthole within a trilithon, or structure consisting of two large vertical stones, which is in turn framed within a larger trilithon and yet another large trilithon. The corbelled ceiling has been taken as a hint that Malta's surface temples, now uncovered, could have been roofed similarly. = Lower level = The lower story contained no bones or offerings, only water. It strongly suggests storage, probably of grain.  Museum  The facade of the museum after restoration in 2017 The Hypogeum and its museum are a popular attraction in Malta. The museum is open at 9am, but queuing for tickets starts around 8am.\\"Last minute\\" 20 tickets for next day are always available from the National War Museum, located in Valletta. Visitors are recommended to book months before, as limited people are allowed per day. The site closed in September 2016 for a ‚Ç¨1.1 million renovation partly financed by a grant from Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The renovated museum was inaugurated by Minister for Culture Owen Bonnici on 28 April 2017 and includes a new climate control system for the Hypogeum as well as an expanded visitor centre. The site reopened to visitors on 15 May 2017.

The language is mainly spoken by the Achomi people, but also by some Huwala. The majority of Larestani people are Sunni Muslims.

In Eastern Arabia (Arab states of the Persian Gulf)  Iranian people who have migrated from southern Iran to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf at the early 20th century still speak this language in their homes, however, this variety has been influenced by the Arabic language a little but is mutually intelligible with standard Persian.  Etymology  Speakers of Lari dialects in Iran that come from different towns might also find some variations in some words and may differ slightly in grammar and particularly in accent. Hence, if the speaker is from Evaz, they are referred as speaking Evazi, and if they are from Bastak their dialect is known as Bastaki. The Larestani language of the Southwestern Pars Province and parts of the Hormozgan Province has many local dialects such as Lari, Gerashi, Evazi, Khonji, Bastaki, etc. With the exception of the regional accent, pronunciation of certain words, and a slight variation in grammar, this old language has been the common language of the Southwestern Pars Province and parts of Hormozgan Province for nearly 1,800 years despite the various conquests of the region since the fall of the Sassanid Empire.  Accents and variations of Lari  Since the Larestan region is widespread, there are different Lari accents and some slight differences in grammar. For example, in some places people say raftom for \\"I went\\" (very similar to the Persian raftam), but in some other places like Lar people say instead (Kurdish: dichim or dechim). = Examples of Lari (bedeshare accent) = = Verbs = To make simple past verbs The ids (om / ot / osh / mo / tosho) + The simple past root of the first type Example: Omgot: I said oshbu: win Tokha: You ate And ...

Passive  To create a passive verb in past tense we can use the verb root plus its proper prefix. For example, in Lari (Larestani), the root for the verb \\"to tell\\" is got (gota equals \\"tell\\"). omgot (om+got), Kurdish (migot or min got) = I told ... (om+got), Kurdish () = You told...

Unlike the other loop diuretics, etacrynic acid is not a sulfonamide and thus, its use is not contraindicated in those with sulfa allergies. Ethacrynic acid is a phenoxyacetic acid derivative containing a ketone group and a methylene group. A cysteine adduct is formed with the methylene group and this is the active form. Medical use Ethacrynic acid is a diuretic that is used to treat edema when a stronger agent is required. It is available as a pill or injected form. The pill is used to treat edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis and renal disease, accumulation of liquid in the belly associated with cancer or edema, and management of hospitalized children with congenital heart disease or nephrotic syndrome. The injected form is used to rapidly remove water from the body when needed - for example in acute pulmonary edema - or when a person cannot take the medicine in pill form.Merck and FDA Etacrynic acid Label. Last updated February 2005 per FDA site for NDA 016093 injected form and FDA site for NDA 016092 oral form per index here, each accessed January 16, 2016 Adverse effects As a diuretic, ethacrynic acid can cause frequent urination, but this usually resolves after taking the drug for a few weeks. Ethacrynic acid can also cause low potassium levels, which may manifest as muscle cramps or weakness. It has also been known to cause reversible or permanent hearing loss (ototoxicity) and liver damage when administered in extremely high dosages. On oral administration, it produces diarrhea; intestinal bleeding may occur at higher doses. Mechanism of action Ethacrynic acid acts by inhibiting NKCC2 in the thick ascending loop of Henle and the macula densa. Loss of potassium ions is less marked but chances of hypochloremic alkalosis are greater. The dose response curve of ethacrynic acid is steeper than that of furosemide and, in general, it is less manageable; dose range is 50-150mg. Ethacrynic acid and its glutathione-adduct are potent inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase family members, which are enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. This family of enzymes has recently been shown to have a high rate of genetic variability.

It runs between the cities of Coventry and Cambridge by way of the county towns of Northampton and Bedford. Together with the A421, (and the A43, M40 and the A34), the eastern section (Cambridge to the A1) of the A428 forms the route between Cambridge and Oxford. The A428 was formerly part of the main route from Birmingham to Felixstowe before the A14 was fully opened in 1993. Route =Coventry - Northampton= The road starts on the A4600 Sky Blue Way in Coventry, heading eastbound out of the city and meeting the A444 and A4082 roads before crossing the A46 Eastern Bypass and into Warwickshire. The road then passes through the village of Binley Woods before becoming more rural in nature, meeting the Fosse Way and crossing the River Avon at Bretford. further along, the road enters Rugby where it meets the A4071 and A426 and passes Rugby School. It then continues out of the town to the east through the suburb of Hillmorton and crosses the A5 near Daventry International Railfreight Terminal (DIRFT). It meets the M1 at its original terminus, junction 18, and bypasses the towns of Crick and West Haddon. The road passes the Althorp family estate, then enters Northampton. =Northampton - Cambridge= East of Northampton, the road passes Little Houghton, Brafield-on-the-Green and Yardley Hastings. After here it enters the borough of Milton Keynes where it meets the A509 at Warrington roundabout. Continuing towards Bedford, the road passes Lavendon and Cold Brayfield. Crossing the Great Ouse it enters Bedfordshire at Turvey, on to Bromham. It meets the A422 at a roundabout outside Bromham. The road bypasses Bromham and, leaving behind its former route east-bound through Bedford (which has become the A4280), swings southwards on a new alignment then, via a new bridge over the Great Ouse, merges with the A421 south of Kempston. The A428 loses its identity here: the route continues as the A421 as it bypasses Bedford, Great Barford and Roxton and goes on to become the dual-carriageway A1 at the Black Cat Roundabout. Heading north, the route leaves the A1 via a grade separated junction just south of St Neots and regains its identity. Crossed by the East Coast Main Line, it leaves Bedfordshire for Cambridgeshire. The A428 from here to Cambridge follows the former A45, which became the A428 when the A14 opened. It meets the A1198 (former A14) at Caxton Gibbet roundabout near Papworth Everard. From here the road is dual carriageway, bypassing the existing single carriageway section near Hardwick. The route terminates, merging into the A14 at Girton interchange, where traffic joins first from the M11 junction 14 and then from the trunk A14 road junction 31. Proposed developments =Oxford to Cambridge Expressway= In the \\"Road investment strategy\\" announced to Parliament by the Department for Transport and Secretary of State for Transport on 1 December 2014, planning will begin to dual the section between the A1 and the A1198 at Caxton Gibbet. The announcement said that the A1/A421 Black Cat Roundabout would be replaced with a grade-separated junction, just a few years after this roundabout was expensively upgraded. The link would provide an uninterrupted dual carriageway route between the M1 at Junction 13 and the A14 near Cambridge, part of a longer-term proposal to establish an \\"Oxford to Cambridge Expressway\\", via (or near) Milton Keynes. On 18 February 2019, Highways England announced final route selection for the new road between Caxton Gibbet and the Black Cat junction (which will cease to be a roundabout and become a three-level GSJ). In September 2019, geological survey work began on the route.

After World War I Zadar became part of Italy, which later helped Nalis to play in Italian movies and portray Italian characters. Nalis began to build his film career after World War Two. His first screen appearance in 1949 film Zastava almost became his last. In the film he played an Ustasha colonel and in the break between shooting he went to the store to buy groceries, forgetting to change his clothes. He was arrested by UDBA and it took some time to convince authorities that he was an actor playing Ustasha rather than actual Ustasha hiding in the woods after the war. Not discouraged by the incident, Nalis continued with his career, appearing in many classics of 1950s and 1960s Croatian and Yugoslav cinema.

Since that time, it has undergone several revisions. The current seal depicts two men, one in buckskin, and the other in more formal dress. The men are facing each other and clasping hands. The outer ring of the seal is adorned with the words \\"Commonwealth of Kentucky\\", and within the inner circle is the state motto \\"United we stand, divided we fall.\\" The official colors of the seal are blue and gold. A version of the seal appears on the flag of Kentucky. History historical coat of arms (illustrated, 1876) Provision for the creation of a seal for the Commonwealth was made during the first session of the Kentucky General Assembly. On December 20, 1792, the Assembly passed an act reading: \\"That the Governor be empowered and is hereby required to provide at the public charge a seal for this Commonwealth; and procure the same to be engraved with the following device, viz: Two friends embracing, with the name of the state over their heads and around about the following motto: United we stand, divided we fall.\\" According to John Brown, Kentucky's first Senator, the original seal was to have depicted \\"two friends, in hunter's garb, their right hands clasped, their left resting on each other's shoulders, their feet on the verge of a precipice.\\" This depiction would represent a literal rendering of the state motto. Lexington silversmith David Humphries was charged with designing the seal in 1793. Instead of hunting apparel, Humphries' version depicted two men in swallowtail coats, and instead of a handshake, the two friends share a full embrace. This original seal was destroyed in a fire that destroyed the state capitol in 1814. Because the description originally adopted by the General Assembly does not specify what the \\"two friends\\" should look like or how they should be embracing, several variants of the state seal were created subsequent to the destruction of the original. Different depictions of the seal have the friends outfitted in various clothing from coats and top hats to Roman togas. The embrace is shown as clasped hands, a hug, or a handshake combined with hands on one another shoulders. It has even been speculated that certain die-makers have intentionally designed strange and unnatural poses to represent that the two friends were drunk on Kentucky bourbon or were demonstrating a secret handshake or symbol from a fraternal order. In 1857, an anonymous artist was commissioned to paint the seals of the various states in the skylights in the House of Representatives' chamber. This artist's depiction showed one man in buckskin boots and a hat and another in formal attire. The two are standing in front of a row of columns and wearing garments resembling togas as overcoats. A 1952 article in The Courier-Journal opined that \\"They stand in a halfhearted embrace, as if each startled the other with his gesture.\\" One particularly odd-looking version of the seal had one of the friends joining his left hand to the other's right, which commissioner of conservation Henry Ward said made the two appear to be dancing an Irish jig. In 1954, Ward asked Louisville native Ernie Giancola to redesign the seal. Using a neighbor as a model, Giancola created a more natural-looking handshake for the friends. In 1962, the General Assembly further clarified the look of the seal to minimize variation in the future. They prescribed that the seal should depict \\"a pioneer meeting a gentleman in a swallowtail coat.\\" The current version of the seal was designed by artist and former mayor of Hazard, Kentucky, Nan Gorman. Symbolism Popular belief claims that the buckskin-clad man on the left is Daniel Boone, who was largely responsible for the exploration of Kentucky, and the man in the suit on the right is Henry Clay, Kentucky's most famous statesman. However, the official explanation is that the men represent all frontiersmen and statesmen, rather than any specific persons. The motto \\"United we stand, divided we fall\\" comes from the lyrics of \\"The Liberty Song\\", a patriotic song from the American Revolution.

The game is based on music, imagery and slogans of the UK band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Objective The game puts the player in Liverpool in search for the Pleasuredome. The player has to find and use various objects and play minigames to reach the goal. The player starts the game as a simple character, to reach the Pleasuredome one has to become a full person. To become a full person, the four attributes (sex, war, love and faith) must be filled to 99%. The attributes are boosted by completing tasks in the game. Additional pleasure points can be scored by playing the minigames. The four attributes are part of the symbols used on the covers of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's albums. During the game a murder takes place. All the rooms the player can visit contain clues in order to find the murderer. The clues are in pairs, helping eliminate suspects. For example, you may be told \\"The killer is an atheist\\" and \\"Mr Somebody is a regular church-goer\\" - so Mr Somebody would be innocent.

Located in the eastern half of the Helsinki conurbation, some north of the capital's downtown district, it is the administrative and commercial hub of Vantaa, although Myyrm√§ki is a rival commercial hub within the municipality. Tikkurila's most popular attraction is the science center Heureka. Tikkurila railway station is the busiest in Vantaa and third-busiest in Finland. As the nearest mainline station to Helsinki Airport, it is served by all the high-speed Pendolino trains on the Helsinki to Tampere and Lahti routes as well as other long-distance services. Some of the other communities surrounding Tikkurila are Jokiniemi, Simonkyl√§, Hiekkaharju, and Puistola in the Helsinki municipality. History left Tikkurila has been a marketplace since the 16th century, from which it has also received its name. Tikkuri is an old Finnish term referring to an amount of ten, used in fur trading at the time. The road between Turku and Vyborg, King's Road, ran through the area, though the area remained a sparsely populated piece of the Helsinki Parish until the late 1800s. In 1862, the railway between Helsinki and H√§meenlinna was constructed, and one of its seven stations was built in Tikkurila, on its intersection with King's Road. The Swedish architect Carl Albert Edelfelt designed a Renaissance Revival styled station building, which (as of the 1970s) has since been adapted into the Vantaa City Museum. The railway brought industry into the area, including an expeller pressing plant, which currently operates in the area as the paint manufacturer Tikkurila Oyj. The railway also induced population growth. In 1946, Tikkurila became the administrative hub of Vantaa (then known as Helsingin maalaiskunta, ), after Malmi was transferred to Helsinki. Post-war population growth led to Tikkurila becoming the most populated area in Vantaa, though the Myyrm√§ki district and major region have both since become more populated than the Tikkurila equivalents. In 1960, a neofuturistic swimming hall was completed in Tikkurila. Culture Heureka science center Finland's largest science center, Heureka, is located in Tikkurila. Opened in 1989, it is a nonprofit organization devoted to popularizing scientific information and to developing the methods used to teach science and scientific concepts. Vantaa City Museum is a museum located in the old station building of Tikkurila railway station. It is operated by the city with free admission, and is used to host exhibitions regarding the city's history. Tikkurila also hosts an annual music festival, Tikkurila Festivaali, from July to August. Services and facilities Tikkurila is home to several services and facilities: * Helsinki Metropolia University Lummetie campus * Laurea University of Applied Sciences campus * National Bureau of Investigation headquarters * Shopping center Dixi at the railway station * Shopping center Tikkuri * Tikkurila Library, the main library of Vantaa * Tikkurila Upper Secondary school, the largest high school in Finland * Vantaa city hall Kielotorni, the tallest building at 50 m (a residential complex) Transportation Tikkurila railway station is the busiest railway station in Vantaa, and the third busiest in all of Finland (after Helsinki Central and Pasila). Although the Helsinki Airport is not located in the Tikkurila major region, Tikkurila railway station is the nearest mainline station to it, connected by the Ring Rail Line and buses. Tikkurila railway station connections include: * Mainline station long-distance trains to most Finnish cities and Russia * P-train to Helsinki * K- and N-trains to Helsinki and Kerava * H-, R-, and T-trains to Helsinki and Riihim√§ki * Z-train to Lahti * I-train to Helsinki Airport Tikkurila also acts as the central bus station of eastern Vantaa, with connections to Helsinki Airport and almost all residential areas.

Plot summary The story takes place in the United Kingdom in the mid-1930s. During the Silver Jubilee of King George V and Queen Mary in May 1935, the entire British Royal Family is killed in a freak accident after the explosion of a large dirigible (similar to the Hindenburg disaster), and the search is on to find a surviving heir of British blood. After an extensive search, the choice falls on Jack Green, a 24-year-old stage actor who, unbeknownst to him, is the grandson of the philandering Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, George V's elder brother, and the nearest living heir. He is virtually kidnapped and brought to Buckingham Palace, where he is placed in the care of William Millingham (known as Willie) who is to be his Private Secretary. Millingham assists the new king during a period of adjustment to his new status. He is duly installed as King John II. After the new king refuses to marry any of several potential queens offered to him, and also makes a speech drawing attention to the problem of unemployment, which is considered highly radical by \\"The Powers That Be,\\" a plot is discovered to discredit him. At the same time, the King begins to chafe at the rigid, ceremonial routine of royal life and the limitations inevitably placed upon his freedom.

It was historically often referred to as St Pancras New Church, in order to distinguish it from St Pancras Old Church, which stands some way to the north. Location The church is on the northern boundary of Bloomsbury, on the south side of Euston Road, at the corner of Upper Woburn Place, in the borough of Camden. When it was built its west front faced into the south-east corner of Euston Square, which had been laid out on either side of what was then simply known as the \\"New Road\\". It was intended as a new principal church for the parish of St Pancras, which once stretched almost from Oxford Street to Highgate. The original parish church was small ancient building to the north of New Road. This had become neglected following a shift in population to the north, and by the early 19th century services were only held there once a month, worship at other times taking place in a chapel in Kentish Town. With the northwards expansion of London into the area, the population in southern part of the parish grew once more, and a new church was felt necessary. Following the opening of the New Church, the Old Church became a chapel of ease, although it was later given its own separate parish. During the 19th century many further churches were built to serve the burgeoning population of the original parish of St Pancras, and by 1890 it had been divided into 33 ecclesiastical parishes. History St Pancras New Church soon after completion in the 1820s. The New Church was built primarily to serve the newly built up areas close to Euston Road, especially parts of the well-to-do district of Bloomsbury. The building of St Pancras church was agreed in 1816. After a competition involving thirty or so tenders, designs by the local architect William Inwood, in collaboration with his son Henry William Inwood, were accepted. The builder was Isaac Seabrook. The first stone was laid by the Duke of York at a ceremony on 1 July 1819. It was carved with a Greek inscription, of which the English translation was \\"May the light of the blessed Gospel thus ever illuminate the dark temples of the Heathen\\". The church was consecrated by the Bishop of London on 7 May 1822, and the sermon was preached by the vicar of St Pancras, James Moore. The total cost of the building, including land and furnishings, was ¬£76,679, making it the most expensive church to be built in London since the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral. It was designed to seat 2,500 people. Architecture The church is in a Greek revival style, using the Ionic order. It is built from brick, faced with Portland stone, except for the portico and the tower above the roof, which are entirely of stone. All the external decoration, including the capitals of the columns is of terracotta. The Inwoods drew on two ancient Greek monuments, the Erechtheum and the Tower of the Winds, both in Athens, for their inspiration. The doorways are closely modelled on those of the Erechtheum, as is the entablature, and much of the other ornamentation. Henry William Inwood was in Athens at the time that the plans for St Pancras were accepted, and brought plaster casts of details of the Erechtheum, and some excavated fragments, back to England. The church pictured in 1948. The west end follows the basic arrangement of portico, vestibules and tower established by James Gibbs at St Martin-in-the-Fields. The octagonal domed ceiling of the vestibule is in imitation of the Tower of the Winds, and the tower above uses details from the same structure. At the east end is an apse, flanked by the church's most original features: two tribunes designed in imitation of the Erechtheum, with entablatures supported by caryatids. Unlike those on the Erechtheum, each caryatid holds a symbolic extinguished torch or an empty jug, appropriate for their positions above the entrances to the burial vault, There is a stone sarcophagus behind the figures in each tribune, and the cornices are studded with lion's heads. The caryatids are made of terracotta, constructed in sections around cast-iron columns, and were modelled by John Charles Felix Rossi, who provided all the terracotta on the building. The upper levels of the tribunes were designed as vestries. Access to the church is through three doorways ranged under the portico. There are no side doors. Inside, the church has a flat ceiling with an uninterrupted span of , and galleries supported on cast-iron columns. The interior of the apse is in the form of one half of a circular temple, with six columns, painted to imitate marble, raised on a plinth. The crypt, which extends the whole length of the church, was designed to contain 2,000 coffins, but fewer than five hundred interments had taken place by 1854, when the practice was ended in all London churches. It served as an air-raid shelter in both world wars and is now used as an art gallery. The church was closed for two years from 1951 for structural renovation made necessary by dry rot and war damage. The North Chapel was added in 1970 and the interior was restored in 1981. The steps of the church were one of several sites used for floral tributes after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The building in Grade I listed. Today St Pancras is still in use as a place of worship. Revd Anne Stevens is the current Vicar. It also has programme of concerts. The church is one of the most important 19th- century churches in England and is a Grade I listed building. However, because of its situation on Euston Road, one of London's busiest roads, it has become stained with pollution and recent cleaning attempts have been unable to remove the staining of much of the Portland stone. In recent years the Church was used as the location for the nearby University College London Christmas orchestra performances, and has from 2006 hosted the University's Christian Union carol services.

The concept of the design is attributed to Dr. Benjamin Vaughan of Hallowell, Maine, while the original sketch is credited to Bertha Smouse, the step-daughter of Col. Isaac Reed of Waldoboro, Maine, who purportedly wrote its official description and explanation. There have been variations in the details of the seal, but the overall design and images remain true to the original. The center of the seal is a shield adorned with a tranquil scene of a moose resting in a field bordered by water and woods; a pine tree stands tall directly behind the moose. On either side of the shield, a farmer rests on his scythe, and a sailor leans on an anchor. Above the shield is the motto \\"Dirigo\\" (I direct) and a stylized North Star. Below the shield is a banner that reads \\"Maine\\". The legislature of 1919 decided that the design of the seal should no longer vary, and the design is still used today. Motto Dƒ´rig≈ç (Latin \\"I direct\\" or \\"I lead\\") is the state motto of Maine, having once been the only state to hold its elections in September. (Politicians kept their eyes on these elections for evidence of a trend. Prior to the New Deal, Republicans claimed \\"As Maine goes, so goes the nation.\\") The resolutions adopting the seal upon which this motto appears, give some insight into the meaning intended by the state motto: \\"...as the Polar Star has been considered the mariner's guide and director in conducting the ship over the pathless ocean to the desired haven, and as the center of magnetic attraction; as it has been figuratively used to denote the point, to which all affections turn, and as it is here intended to represent the State, it may be considered the citizens' guide, and the object to which the patriot's best exertions should be directed\\". The motto and seal are used by the University of Maine. The motto has also been used for the name of the Dirigo Health Agency which oversees the state of Maine's health care system. Design As stated in Maine law, Title 1 Section 201: The seal of the State shall be a shield, argent, charged with a pine tree (americana, quinis ex uno folliculo setis) with a moose (cervus alces), at the foot of it, recumbent; supporters: on dexter side, a husbandman, resting on a scythe; on sinister side, a seaman, resting on an anchor. In the foreground, representing sea and land, and under the shield, shall be the name of the State in large Roman capitals, to wit: MAINE. The whole shall be surrounded by a crest, the North Star. The motto, in small Roman capitals, shall be in a label interposed between the shield and crest, viz.: DIRIGO. Shortly after Maine became a state, the official state seal was adopted on June 9, 1820. Although, ‚Äúthere are no records indicating how the motto was developed or selected,‚Äù according to David Chever, former Maine State archivist and vice chairman of Maine‚Äôs Bicentennial Committee, it is known that William Moody of Saco, who was the first president of the Maine Senate, over saw the process. Isaac Reed is credited with having written the description and explanation of the seal: ‚ÄúThe motto, in small Roman capitals, shall be in a label (that reads) DIRIGO.‚Äù The label would be located between the star ‚Äì ‚Äúthe mariner‚Äôs guide ‚Ä¶ over the pathless ocean to the desired haven‚Äù ‚Äì and a shield featuring a moose, a pine tree, a farmer and a sailor.‚Äù Although originally from Waldoboro, Massachussetts, Reed was opposed to Maine becoming a state. In April 1816, he moved his family into a Mansion on Glidden in Waldoboro, Maine, historically named: the Reed Mansion. It was there that Reed and his step-daughter, Bertha Smouse, purportedly worked on the seal together. It has been noted, however, how ironic Reed‚Äôs involvement was at the time, since he campaigned fellow townsfolk to vote against Maine becoming a state. ‚ÄúWhen sent by the town to the 1816 Constitutional Convention in Brunswick, Reed argued strongly against separation from Massachusetts, as he did again in Portland in 1819,‚Äù states a 2005 National House Register application for the Reed Mansion.First State Seal design submitted to the Legislature sub-committee While the explanation of the seal is credited to Reed, the original first draft of the design is credited to Dr. Benjamin Vaughan from Hallowell, Maine. A distinguished doctor with degrees from Harvard University and Bowdoin College, Vaughan‚Äôs reputation as a learned man was well known. His private library alone was equal to the size of Harvard‚Äôs.Vaughn, Benjamin. Maine: An Encyclopedia. August 10, 2020 Publishing numerous articles, Vaughan devoted his life to building mills, stores, printing-offices, breweries, and advocating toward the Settlement of Kennebec County. Drawing details from Reed's description, Vaughan submitted a preliminary sketch to the legislature sub-committee. The design was nearly unanimously rejected for various reasons: the moose looked \\"more like a deer,\\" and one committee member complained that his initial desire that the aurora borealis and a quote from St. Paul was not included. Despite the fact that a state seal was needed for immediate use on official documents, ‚Äúno part of it was very ingeniously wrought or executed; hence people of taste and judgment have not been altogether pleased with the devices, or emblems,‚Äù says historian William D. Williamson. How it finally came to approval is unknown; but since that time, various stories, printed articles and even Maine towns have disputed authorship over the original sketch design. On June 12, 1820 The Portland Gazette reported: \\"We understand that the emblems for the seal of the State were proposed by Benjamin Vaughan, Esq. of Hallowell, that the sketch was executed by a young lady in this town, and that the Motto, description, explanation, &c; are from the pen of Col. Isaac G. Reed, a member of the House of Representatives from Waldoborough.\\"More commonly recognized Seal of Maine design However, in 2020, in celebration of Maine‚Äôs bicentennial, a contest was announced in partnership with the Vaughan Woods & Historical Homestead that sought a modern interpretation of the original Maine state seal. The winning submission would be hung over the mantel in the Benjamin Vaughan Homestead dining room. Maine Bicentennial: Call for Proposals ‚Äì State Seal Modern Interpretation. Vaughan Woods Homestead. 2020. In the Sun Journal, Vaughan is quoted to have proposed the emblems, and one of his own daughters crudely fashioned the original sketch at their dining room table. ‚ÄúWe are the most northern state in the Union,‚Äù Vaughan said, ‚Äúyet what is an ordinary star for all other states becomes the North Star for us.‚Äù Maine Historical Society Bicentennial Education Fellow, Brittany Cook, stated in a 2020 virtual hub, that the new state of Maine turned to a man named Vaughan to design the state seal, and his daughter is said to have sketched the first design.The Maine State Seal. Maine Historical Bicentennial Education Virtual Hub. Brittany Cook. April 30, 2020. Although Maine state historian, Herb Adams also says that a sub-committee of the Maine legislature turned to Vaughan to design the seal, President of the Waldoboro Historical Society, Jean B. Lawrence, states that the step-daughter of Isaac Reed, Bertha Smouse, created the original design by stitching it in needlework.‚ÄúBertha Smouse‚Äôs Gift to Maine‚Äù Maine Bicentennial Calendar.

When referenced, Bertha Smouse is believed or credited as having created the state seal.Maine: State Flag. states101.com August 10, 2020 On March 26, 2020, the trustees of the Waldoborough Historical Society announced that they had been chosen to receive funding to erect a sign outside of the former site of the Reed Mansion in Waldoboro, Maine to commemorate the \\"1820 State Seal Visual gift of Bertha Smouse.\\" According to Lawrence, a 17 year old Smouse created a \\"needlework visual\\" from a list of suggestions given by her father. In 1930, the Maine Library Bulletin discovered that ‚Äúit is generally conceded that (Reed) was the author of the detailed and somewhat flowery description of the (seal) and the symbols comprising it. It is said that the final sketch presented with the report (to the Legislature) was the work of Miss Bertha Smouse, a step- daughter of Colonel Reed.‚Äù The bulletin went to reveal that no descendant of Reed‚Äôs could confirm any family members‚Äô participation in designing the seal. ‚ÄúAnd while (Bertha Smouse) could have had a hand in drawing the seal, there is no evidence to support this claim,‚Äù the National Register application states. In section 8, page 4 of the Registration Form received on June 22, 2005 to place the Reed Mansion on the National Register of Historic Places, the submitted claim for significance states: \\"It is said that the final sketch presented with the report, a parchment copy of which was placed in the office of the Secretary of State, was the work of Mss Bertha Smouse, a step-daughter of Colonel Reed.

Like the turtles, Casey Jones is a vigilante, and was created as a parody of vigilante characters that were in comics. Casey usually has long dark hair, wears an ice hockey mask and cut-off biking gloves, and carries his weapons in a golf bag over his shoulder. His weapons include various sports equipment, such as baseball bats, ice hockey sticks, golf clubs, cricket bats, and tennis rackets. He becomes a love interest of April O'Neil. In most installments and all related media, Casey Jones has been portrayed by several actors. He was first voiced by Pat Fraley in the 1987 series, Marc Thompson in the 2003 series, Chris Evans in the 2007 film, Josh Peck in the 2012 series, Zelda Williams as a female version in the 2018 series, and has been portrayed in live action by Elias Koteas in the 1990 and 1993 films and by Stephen Amell in the 2016 film. Origins When Jones was young, his father, Arnold Casey Jones Sr., owned an auto shop. A group of Purple Dragon members (led by a young Hun) burned the shop down, killed his father and took his mother and sister hostage. The badly beaten Casey refused to lie down and take Hun's blows. He attacked Hun with a knife, stabbing him in the neck. Enraged, Hun had beaten him to within an inch of his life as Casey is forced to see Hun inside his eye pupil. It seemed that this traumatic event resulted in several mental and emotional disorders when a reflection of Hun's appears in Casey's eye; explaining his often violent and erratic behavior. According to the initial creators (Kevin Eastman), they had intended for Casey to have become a vigilante because he watched too many bad cop shows (like Peter Laird used to) as implied by the character's first appearance in Raphael #1 (1985), as opposed to the more overused storyline where the hero does so after seeing his family killed in front of him. However, this is semi- retconned when writer Tristan Huw Jones imported his 2003 TV series back- story, in Tales issue #56. Beginnings New York City, where Jones is from, was overrun by criminals. Enticed by examples from TV, Casey decided to do something about the crime in the streets. After equipping himself with a hockey mask and various sports clubs, he began his vigilante campaign. He started his career with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles when he ran into Raphael beating up a pair of muggers. When Raphael let them go, Casey proceeded to \\"finish them off,\\" but was stopped by Raphael. The two clashed but eventually helped each other take down additional muggers that appeared after their fight. Mirage Casey first appeared in the Raphael solo issue \\"Me, Myself and I.\\" Raphael runs into Casey beating some muggers and proceeds to stop him before the crooks are murdered. Jones and Raphael fight several times before making peace with each other. Later, he comes to the aid of the Turtles, Splinter and April O'Neil when they are attacked by the resurrected Shredder at April's home. The seven escape, and retreat to a farmhouse in Northampton, Massachusetts that once belonged to Casey's grandmother. Casey \\"officially\\" becomes a part of the Turtles' family around this point, and the farmhouse acts as a second home to the group for some time. In the Mirage series, Casey is extremely violent, even more so than Raphael, but he mellows throughout the course of the series. In Shades of Gray, Casey accidentally kills a teenager who tried to mug him. The incident sent him into a drunken spiral, damaging his relationship with April O'Neil.\\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" issues #48 and #49 (1992), \\"Shades of Gray\\" His initial homicidal tendencies are especially present in his first appearance, although he never actually murders anyone in that instance.\\"Raphael\\" One-shot magazine (1985), \\"Blind Faith\\" During the three-part episode City at War, Casey leaves the farmhouse and begins to drive to Los Angeles, planning to find April, but instead meets a pregnant woman named Gabrielle with whom he falls in love and marries. Gabrielle dies during childbirth and Casey is left to take care of her daughter, whom he names Shadow. After spreading Gabrielle's ashes, Casey returns to New York with Shadow to stay with his mother. In a chance encounter, Casey is reunited with April when she comes to buy the apartment building owned by Casey's mother. During this meeting it's revealed that Casey's real name is Arnold but prefers to use his middle name only. Casey repairs his relationship with April and they begin dating. By volume four, he and April are married, raising Shadow as their daughter and trying to have a child of their own. April eventually leaves Casey and Shadow when she learns that she is not human and is a product of the Kirby warp pen. As April comes to terms within herself in Alaska, Casey takes to the nightclubs to drown his sorrows. He meets up with the Foot Clan leader Karai at one of these clubs and, after a few drinks, awakens at Karai's retreat with no memory of the night before, although Karai knows something of what had happened. This plotline was left unresolved as the fourth volume came to an abrupt end. Archie Comics Although mentioned, Casey Jones never appears in the Archie Comics Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures. Dreamwave Productions The fourth issue of the Dreamwave Productions series (based on the 2003 animated series) focused entirely on Casey Jones. When Casey was a little kid, he was worried that his dad should give into the Purple Dragons and their protection racket, lest something bad happen. Mr. Jones becomes violent and tells Casey that he's playing on HIS team and that a Jones never gives in (nearly punching Casey in a violent rage). Mr. Jones hears something and figures it's the Purple Dragons breaking into his store. Casey watches as his father's store burns to the ground. The Purple Dragon leader, Hun, then smacks Casey aside with the encouragement that his father pay up. Casey breaks a bottle and stabs Hun in the leg with it. Furious, Hun has his thugs beat Casey to a pulp. Before being thrown out of the hospital because he lacked insurance, Casey is diagnosed with brain damage from the beating. Shortly after that, Mr. Jones goes searching for Hun to get revenge and vanishes. Casey's mom then goes searching for her husband and vanishes, too. Casey drifts off into a delusional state, reassuring himself that his father and mother are still alive, just waiting for Casey to clean the streets of all the Purple Dragons before they can return. IDW Comics In the TMNT series released by IDW Publishing, Casey is a young college scholarship holder. Upon his mother's death by cancer, his father became an alcoholic thug who would vent his daily frustration on his son. On one such occasion, Casey was saved from another violent beating by Raphael, who had at that time lived a solitary life as a street vagrant following his mutation (unaware that he had a family searching for him), and the two quickly became fast friends and fellow vigilantes until Raphael was reunited with his family, at which point Casey was introduced to and befriended the other three turtles as well. Television =1987 TMNT animated series= In the 1987 animated series, Casey Jones is a crazed vigilante with a \\"Dirty Harry\\" like persona, who goes after all sorts of criminals, from robbers to litterers. He never takes off his mask on screen, even when once going undercover in a business suit. Appearing in only five episodes of the series, this version of Casey does not play a role as central as his comic book counterpart: He doesn't have a friendship with Raphael, nor a relationship with April ‚Äì he doesn't even encounter her until season 5's Leonardo Cuts Loose, though later they do team up in episodes Night of the Rogues and Cyber-Turtles. Casey was voiced by Pat Fraley. In the Japanese version, he was voiced by Issei Futamata and Akio ≈åtsuka (NHK-BS2 Version). =2003 TMNT animated series= In the 2003 animated series, Jones has a much more important role. He speaks in a Brooklyn accent, voiced by Marc Thompson in English and Tokuyoshi Kawashima in Japanese. This incarnation's personality is on par with Raphael's. Raphael first meets Casey while the vigilante tries to stop a mugging by the Purple Dragons. Seeing a lot of himself in Casey, Raphael tries to reason with him and prevent him from letting his anger get the best of him (Raphael himself had just almost severely injured Michelangelo and was overwhelmed by guilt). Though initially uninterested in what he has to say, Casey eventually bonds with Raphael after he loses to Raph in a bike race and begins listening to his lessons. Casey, Raphael, and the other turtles proceed to team up and defeat a gang of Purple Dragons. From this point on, Casey becomes a valuable ally of the Turtles, and has a closer friendship with Raphael than in any other incarnation. Casey's backstory is fleshed out over the course of the series. When he was a child, his father's shop was burned down by Hun and the Purple Dragons for being denied protection money.Fallen Angel Despite being threatened not to, his father (Arnold Casey Jones Sr.) later went to the police over it. It is implied that he was killed for doing so.\\"Dragons Rising\\" features a flashback of Casey's father telling him the importance of doing \\"the right thing.\\" In the present, Casey relates this to Hun, who replies that he was \\"'dead' wrong!\\" This gave Casey his hatred for crime and an essential lifelong vendetta against the Purple Dragons. This backstory was later expanded upon in the Dreamwave comics and adopted into the Mirage series. It is revealed in episode \\"The Lesson\\" that he and the Turtles had met when they were kids, although neither the Turtles nor Casey are aware of the truth. During a trip to the surface, the young Turtles witness bullies picking on young \\"Arnie\\". Disguising themselves as a human child, they attempt to teach him self-defense. However, their unique perspectives and attitudes resulted in more trouble than help. In the end, however, young Casey angrily jumps to the defense of a friend against the bullies, proclaiming they were no match for \\"Arnold Casey Jones!\\" In a bit of foreshadowing, he uses a bully's hockey stick against them. His main catchphrase is the battle cry \\"Goongala!\\". It is also revealed in \\"The Lesson\\" that this came from a young Casey being unable to pronounce \\"gorogoro-sama\\", a battle cry literally meaning \\"Mr. Thunder\\", that young Michelangelo kept trying to teach him. \\"Goongala\\" was the best he could come up with. Despite his lack of intelligence and apparent incompetence, he was early on in the series referred to by Hun as \\"Our (the Purple Dragon's) greatest enemy\\", and a fighting tournament was held to see which Dragon would have the honor of killing him, indicating how serious a threat the criminal underworld views him as. In the series, Casey has a good heart, but is easily enraged and occasionally bumbling. He loves motorcycles. In a symbolic way, he sees the Turtles as the little brothers he never had. As such, he often comes to their aid against the Shredder, the Foot Clan, or other enemies. Early on, Casey meets April and there is an initial attraction. However, their conflicting personalities lead to frequent arguments at first. Over time, however, they start dating and a serious relationship develops. In the Back to the Sewers (seventh) season, Casey proposes marriage to her. In the finale \\"Wedding Bells and Bytes\\", they are married, with Raphael serving as the best man and Michelangelo as the maid of honor. Many recurring characters were in attendance and the ceremony performed by the Fugitoid. In the Fast Forward (sixth) season, the Turtles and Splinter are transported to 2105, where they meet April and Casey's great grandson, Cody Jones, the heir to O'Neil Tech, a company created by April, Casey and Donatello after the turtles return to their own time. One of Cody's inventions, the Turtle X armor, resembles Casey's hockey mask. =2012 TMNT animated series= Casey Jones has been confirmed to appear in the second season of the 2012 animated series. In the tie-in prequel comic on the official website, Raphael spots some graffiti on a sewer wall that says, \\"Jones is everywhere!\\", which also had his iconic hockey mask painted beside it. In a new trailer from IGN, it shows that Casey thinks he's the \\"Last Hope\\" for New York City. He seems to know about mutants, which is seen when he rescues April from Mutagen Man and is shown to be able to defeat him on his own. An interview with show creator Ciro Nieli on IGN elaborates: :I asked about Casey Jones on the series, and Nieli replied, \\"Casey Jones will show up in the second season,\\" noting he didn't want to give too much away, but that, \\"We'll take our time introducing him.\\" Casey will also be a high school student, but \\"Maybe a couple years older ‚Äì he got held back.\\" He is voiced by Josh Peck. He is introduced in the episode \\"Mutagen Man Unleashed\\" as a hockey player who April tutors in school. He later becomes a vigilante who hunts criminals, mutants and anything that he thinks threatens \\"his\\" city in season two's episode \\"The Good, The Bad and Casey Jones\\" and becomes an ally to the turtles, specifically Raphael who becomes his best friend. He also has rivalry with Donatello due to their mutual feelings for April. Casey also has a penchant for speaking in third-person and has a fear of rats, which includes Splinter to an extent. As the series progresses, his rivalry with Donatello is lessened, and he becomes closer to the whole team in general. In season three's \\"Casey Jones VS. The Underworld\\" Casey decides to start hunting crime on his own and eventually meets his new own archenemy, Hun, the new leader of the Purple Dragons. He is defeated, at first, but later defeats Hun and prolongs Shredder's plans. He is later one of only six inhabitants of Earth-the others being April and the Turtles-to be rescued before the planet is consumed by an artificial black hole. In the Season 4 finale, \\"Owari\\" Casey assists the Turtles in avenging the death of Splinter. When the Turtles gear up for a mission, Casey gets a new mask that bears a strong resemblance to his comic counterpart. In the alternate future seen in Raphael: Mutant Apocalypse, Casey was one of the many humans that died as a result of a giant Mutagen bomb hitting the planet. Raphael kept his skull and helmet, which was attached to a bomb that he used to take down Maximus Kong's vehicle. In the Monstrous Tales saga, Casey turns into a vampire, along with April, Donatello and Raphael, until he returns to normal, due to Mikey defeating Dracula. In the Crossover Tales saga, Casey assists the Turtles and their 1980s counterparts in stopping Krang and the 1980s counterpart of the Shredder. He and April enlists Karai and Shinigami to hunt down Bebop and Rocksteady in \\"The Foot Walks Again\\". Later, Casey teams up with the Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals to put an end to Zeck and Steranko in \\"The Big Blowout\\". =2018 TMNT animated series= In Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the series introduced a genderbent version of the character named Cassandra \\"Casey\\" Jones who is voiced by Zelda Williams. Before her identity was revealed, she was originally known as the Foot Recruit of the Foot Clan who debuted in \\"Hot Soup: The Game.\\" By the four part episode \\"Finale,\\" Shredder regained his power of speech and made the Foot Recruit his new general after the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute were trapped upon the collapse of Baron Draxum's laboratory. When at the Crying Titan, Shredder had the Foot Recruit prepare the ritual where it combined with the Empyrean within the Crying Titan would enable him to drain Splinter's essence. During the Turtles and April's fight with Shredder, Casey defected to their side and helped them, Baron Draxum, and the spirits of the Hamato Clan's ancestors defeat the Shredder while returning Oroku Saki's spirit to them. Feature films Casey Jones has lead roles in four of the six Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films. In the first film, he is portrayed by Elias Koteas. He is a former professional ice hockey player who had turned vigilante after his career ended early due to an injury. He encounters Raphael while attacking some purse-snatchers. Raphael stops Casey from harming the thieves, whereupon Casey turns his aggression on Raphael. Casey later sees Raphael alone on a rooftop surrounded by Foot soldiers and comes to the Turtles' aid in the subsequent attack. He is referred to by Michelangelo as \\"Wayne Gretzky on steroids.\\" Casey Jones joins the Turtles to assist them against the Shredder and the Foot, mentions to April that he was a professional ice hockey player until he got injured, and ultimately rescues Splinter from the Foot's headquarters and crushes the Shredder in a garbage truck. He also falls in love with April in the process. In the third film, Casey (once again portrayed by Elias Koteas) returns at the Turtles' request to assist Splinter in watching over the four honor guards that were transported to the present when the Turtles would take their place in feudal Japan. Koteas also appears as an ancestor of Jones named Whit who, like his descendant, ends up helping the Turtles despite anti-heroic tendencies. He also shows a romantic interest in April, as Casey does. It is implied that Casey had gone away for a while, explaining his absence in the second film. Casey appears in the 2007 TMNT film, and is voiced by Chris Evans. By the time the film takes place, Casey is now in a relationship with April and he works for her shipping company as a delivery man, spending his nights continuing his vigilante activities. Through this, he meets Raphael as the Nightwatcher, becoming his sidekick - though he claims Raphael is the sidekick. At the beginning of the film, he is the only character to know that Raphael is the Nightwatcher. When he meets Raphael in costume, the latter is at first confused as to how he was able to figure it out, where Casey responds, \\"Wasn't that hard, man. Y'know, you look like a big metal turtle,\\" and Raphael says, rather despondently, \\"It's that obvious, huh?\\" Jones appears in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, the sequel to the 2014 film and played by Arrow star, Stephen Amell. Here, Jones is portrayed as a hot-headed prison guard who dreams of being a NYC Detective. After the Shredder escapes from custody and Bebop and Rocksteady beat him up and steal his armored vehicle Casey decides to hunt the two criminals on his own. Tracking them to the TCRI building, Jones notices April being pursued by the Foot and grabs from his trunk his hockey stick and mask, which he uses to fight the Foot Clan. He is quickly introduced to the turtles and becomes a butt of their jokes, with Raph and Mikey mocking his hockey mask and later tricking him into attacking Master Splinter (which results in Casey getting easily defeated). However, within a day Raph and Mikey warm up to Casey and convince him to help them steal the Purple Ooze from police headquarters. When the turtles are threatened by the police Casey and April place themselves in the line of fire to buy the turtles time to escape. Later, after Casey and April are freed, Casey assists in the final battle by taking on Bebop and Rocksteady. He makes a pair of homemade roller blades and uses a lead pipe like a hockey stick to defeat them. This Casey is shown to be a good man who only fights crime on his own when he feels like he has no choice. He does not use a wide array of weapons, opting for just his hockey stick and later a lead pipe. The film ends with Casey and April arranging to go on a date.

Though a native of Asia it was transported into Europe and later into North America, supposedly in the straw bedding of Hessian troops during the American Revolution (1775‚Äì83), thus the origin of its common name. There are usually two generations a year but may be up to five. In the spring the dark-coloured female lays about 250 to 300 reddish eggs on plants, usually where the stems are covered by leaves; the larvae feed on the sap and weaken the plants so that they cannot bear grain. The Hessian fly was described by Thomas Say in 1817. It is a very harmful insect. It mainly attacks the stem, although if it is especially hungry it will eat any part of the plant it can find. In 1836, a severe infestation of Hessian flies resulted in a crop shortage aggravating the financial problems of farmers prior to the Panic of 1837.McGrane, Reginald Charles.

Not all systems have conserved quantities, and conserved quantities are not unique, since one can always apply a function to a conserved quantity, such as adding a number. Since many laws of physics express some kind of conservation, conserved quantities commonly exist in mathematical models of physical systems. For example, any classical mechanics model will have mechanical energy as a conserved quantity so long as the forces involved are conservative. Differential equations For a first order system of differential equations :\\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{d t} = \\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf r, t) where bold indicates vector quantities, a scalar-valued function H(r) is a conserved quantity of the system if, for all time and initial conditions in some specific domain, :\\\\frac{d H}{d t} = 0 Note that by using the multivariate chain rule, :\\\\frac{d H}{d t} = abla H \\\\cdot \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{d t} = abla H \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf r, t) so that the definition may be written as : abla H \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf r, t) = 0 which contains information specific to the system and can be helpful in finding conserved quantities, or establishing whether or not a conserved quantity exists.  Hamiltonian mechanics  For a system defined by the Hamiltonian H, a function f of the generalized coordinates q and generalized momenta p has time evolution :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}f}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\\\\\{f, \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\\\\\} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} and hence is conserved if and only if \\\\\\\\{f, \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\\\\\} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} = 0. Here \\\\\\\\{f, \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\\\\\} denotes the Poisson bracket.  Lagrangian mechanics  Suppose a system is defined by the Lagrangian L with generalized coordinates q. If L has no explicit time dependence (so \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t}=0), then the energy E defined by : E = \\\\sum_i \\\\left[ \\\\dot q_i \\\\frac{ \\\\partial L}{ \\\\partial \\\\dot q_i} \\\\right] - L is conserved. Furthermore, if \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q} = 0, then q is said to be a cyclic coordinate and the generalized momentum p defined by : p = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot q} is conserved. This may be derived by using the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations.

It was formed both to protect Colorado against incursions from the Confederate forces and to fight the Native Americans who already inhabited the area. Command of this unit was given Colonel John Chivington, who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Glorieta Pass in the New Mexico Territory early in 1862, against Confederate forces. Sand Creek Massacre In early 1864, the 1st Colorado Veteran Volunteers (aka the Veterans Battalion) appears to have initiated the Colorado War by attacking Cheyenne Indians at Fremont's Orchard. The resulting hostilities and Indian retaliations brought traffic on the wagon trails into Denver to a standstill. Peace negotiations were in progress, and encampments of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians on Sand Creek had been assured by the US government that they would not be attacked. Instead, in what is known as the Sand Creek Massacre, Chivington and his troops struck in November 1864, a dawn attack that massacred an estimated one-quarter of the Indian encampments, mostly old men, women, and children. Body parts were taken as souvenirs. The event was the basis of the slaughter of an Indian village in the movies Soldier Blue and Little Big Man. Initial reports of the battle were taken as a victory in the US, but as details came out, opinions changed. A subsequent Congressional investigation resulted in a scorching castigation of the event, Colonel John Chivington, and the 1st Colorado Cavalry. Statue Controversy In the night between June 24th and 25th, 2020, a group of Black Lives Matter protestors tore down a statue honoring Coloradan Civil War soldiers because they were uneducated and had no idea about its historical significance. The statue was designed by Captain Jack Howland, a member of the regiment and located in front of the Colorado State Capitol. A member of the group that tore down the statue was quoted as saying, \\"We have no idea what the statue means.\\" See also *List of Colorado Territory Civil War units *Sand Creek Massacre References Category:Colorado Civil War regiments C Category:1862 establishments in Colorado Territory Category:Military units and formations established in 1862 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1865 Category:1865 disestablishments in the United States ","title":"1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment"},{"id":"2458497","text":"This is a list of individual single-season records for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball.

The flag of the state of Illinois consists of the seal of Illinois on a white background, with the word \\"Illinois\\" underneath the seal. The present seal was adopted in 1869, the flag bearing the central elements of the seal was adopted in 1915, and the word Illinois was added to the flag in 1970. Design The current flag depicts the Great Seal of Illinois, which was originally designed in 1819 and emulated the Great Seal of the United States. In the eagle's beak there is a banner with the state motto, \\"State Sovereignty, National Union.\\" The dates on the seal, 1818 and 1868, represent the year Illinois became a state and the year in which the Great Seal was redesigned by Sharon Tyndale. Although \\"State Sovereignty\\" comes first in the motto, \\"State\\" is at the bottom and \\"Sovereignty\\" is upside-down. Seal history The first Great Seal of the State of Illinois was adopted in 1819 by the first Illinois General Assembly. The first law authorizing the Great Seal required the Secretary of State of Illinois to procure and keep the seal. The first seal engraved was essentially a copy of the Great Seal of the United States. It was used until 1839, when it was recut. The seal designed in 1839 became the Second Great Seal. Illinois Secretary of State Sharon Tyndale spearheaded the drive to create a third state seal for Illinois. In 1867, he asked State Senator Allen C. Fuller to introduce legislation requiring a new seal, and suggested to Fuller that the words of the state motto be reversed, from \\"State Sovereignty, National Union\\", to \\"National Union, State Sovereignty\\". However, the bill passed by the legislature on March 7, 1867, kept the original wording. Despite declining his suggestion, the legislature nonetheless entrusted Tyndale with designing the new seal. And Tyndale managed to (literally) twist the legislature's intent; he kept the words in the correct order on the banner, but the banner twists, so the word \\"Sovereignty\\" is upside down, arguably making it less readable. Tyndale's seal features a bald eagle pitched on a rock carrying a shield in its talons and a banner with the state motto in its beak. Thirteen stars and thirteen stripes on the shield represent the original thirteen states of the Union. The date August 26, 1818, when Illinois's first constitution was adopted in Kaskaskia, appears along the bottom arc of the circle, and 1818, the year of statehood, displays on the seal below 1868, the year the current seal was adopted. This basic design has survived through several minor modifications since it was first conceived. The Illinois Secretary of State is still the keeper of the Great Seal of the State of Illinois. Flag history Ella Park Lawrence holds the original Illinois state flag, ca. 1915. Illinois's flag from 1915 to 1969 =Initial adoption, 1915= During her time as state regent of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1912, Ella Park Lawrence began a campaign to have Illinois adopt a state flag. She was unsuccessful during her time as state regent, but continued to lobby members of the Illinois General Assembly to adopt a state flag as a member of the Rockford chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. On April 1, 1914, Lawrence sent a letter to every Illinois chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution announcing a contest to design an Illinois state flag, with the winner receiving a prize of $25. Thirty-five designs were submitted in response to this contest. The contest was judged by a panel chaired by Lewis Stevenson, Illinois Secretary of State. They selected the design of Lucy Derwent. The flag became the official state banner on July 6, 1915, following its passage in the Illinois State House and Senate. Governor Edward F. Dunne did not sign the bill, but he did not veto it. =1969 alterations= In the 1960s, Chief Petty Officer Bruce McDaniel petitioned to have the name of the state added to the flag. He noted that many of the people he served with during the Vietnam War did not recognize the banner. Governor Richard B. Ogilvie signed the addition to the flag into law on September 17, 1969, and the new flag was designed by Mrs. Sanford Hutchinson and became the official flag on July 1, 1970.Illinois.gov - Illinois Facts - Official State Flag = Illinois Centennial design = Illinois Centennial flag by Wallace Rice For Illinois's first 100 years of statehood in 1918, Wallace Rice, who designed Chicago's flag, designed a centennial flag for the state. It had three horizontal bands of equal width alternating white, blue, white. It was charged with 21 stars along the edge of the hoist. There were 10 blue stars in the upper white band and 10 in the lower white band, representing the 10 northern and 10 southern states at the time of Illinois' statehood in 1818. The center blue band had one large, white star for the state of Illinois itself.

The vetkoek forms part of South African culture. It is similar to the Caribbean Johnny cake, the Dutch oliebol, and the Mexican sopaipillas. The word vetkoek literally means \\"fat cake\\" in Afrikaans. It is similar in shape to a doughnut without a hole, and is made with a yeast dough.

It is noted for its large berries. Its natural range is the Pacific Ocean coasts of North and South America, and also Hawaii. Migratory birds are thought to have dispersed F. chiloensis from the Pacific coast of North America to the mountains of Hawaii, Chile, and Argentina. Fragaria chiliensis fructu maximo (F. chiloensis), illustrated in A-F Fr√©zier's account of his voyage to South America (1716) It is an evergreen plant growing to 15‚Äì30 centimetres (5.9‚Äì11.8 in) tall, with glossy green trifoliate leaves, each leaflet around 5 centimetres (2.0 in) long. The flowers are white, produced in spring and early summer. The fruit is edible, red on the surface, white inside. Its fruit is still sold as a local delicacy in some South American produce markets. Am√©d√©e-Fran√ßois Fr√©zier (1682‚Äì1773) was the first to bring back specimens of Fragaria chiloensis to the Old World. Chaetosiphon fragaefolii, the strawberry aphid, is a bug species found feed on F. chiloensis in Chile. It is a vector of the strawberry mild yellow-edge virus.  Subspecies  There are a number of subspecies and forms: * Fragaria chiloensis subsp. chiloensis forma chiloensis * Fragaria chiloensis subsp. chiloensis forma patagonica (Argentina, Chile) * Fragaria chiloensis subsp. lucida (E. Vilm. ex Gay) Staudt (coast of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) * Fragaria chiloensis subsp. pacifica Staudt (coast of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) * Fragaria chiloensis subsp. sandwicensis (Decne.)

Genetics  All strawberries have a base haploid count of 7 chromosomes. Fragaria chiloensis is octoploid, having eight sets of these chromosomes for a total of 56. These eight genomes pair as four distinct sets, of two different types, with little or no pairing between sets. The genome composition of the octoploid strawberry species has generally been indicated as AAA'A'BBB'B'. The A-type genomes were likely contributed by diploid ancestors related to Fragaria vesca or similar species, while the B-type genomes seem to descend from a close relative of Fragaria iinumae. The exact process of hybridization and speciation which resulted in the octoploid species is still unknown, but it appears that the genome compositions of both Fragaria chiloensis and Fragaria virginiana (and by extension the cultivated octoploid strawberry as well) are identical.

It is primarily a mail-based ministry with an address in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with churches in New York City and Houston. In 1999, St. Matthew Publishing Inc. reported $26.8 million in revenue. In 2007, it reportedly earned $6 million a month.  Origins  The ministry is led by its founder James Eugene \\"Gene\\" Ewing, a former tent minister, who, according to the Trinity Foundation, lives in Beverly Hills, California.Salinger, Lawrence M. Encyclopedia of White-collar & Corporate Crime. p. 681. Ewing, a native of Kaufman, Texas, was born in 1933 and has written fundraising letters for other evangelists, including Oral Roberts as well as Don Stewart, WV Grant, and Rex Humbard. Ewing operates Church by Mail Inc., which had a several decade long struggle with the IRS before being denied tax-exemption in 1992, which was appealed. Ewing was a revivalist in the 1960s with revenue at $2 million. He then began writing fundraising letters for Oral Roberts. By 1971, Ewing renamed organization Church of Compassion as a \\"mail-order church with half a million 'members'\\" with income exceeding $3 million. In 1979, he started for-profit advertising and printing \\"to provide printing and mailing services to nonprofit religious groups.\\" Then, in 1980, his business Church by Mail applied for tax-exemption. However, by the 1990s his businesses owed back taxes to state and federal agencies. Nonetheless, in 1993, he bought a $2.2 million, home above Beverly Hills. Subsequently, a year later the U.S. Tax Court ruled Church by Mail Inc. is \\"operated for private rather than public interests\\" and \\"is not a church\\" within the meaning of federal tax laws.  Operations and fundraising  The ministry has been accused of preying on low- income and elderly people by using census records to target their mailings. Although for several years the ministry operated without a church building and conducted its direct mail donation operation through the Tulsa address, a physical location to hold services‚Äîa then-78-year-old Baptist church in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood‚Äîwas purchased in Houston in 2004. St. Matthew's Churches' lawyer says weekly services draw about 1,000 people. According to the Trinity Foundation, an evangelical watchdog group, the physical churches are only associated with the mail-based ministry as a cover that allows the lucrative operation to retain tax-exempt church status.Trinity Foundation. Prayer rug to riches The status was granted by the Internal Revenue Service in 2000 after a 17-year court battle. One of the organization's mailings consists of a paper \\"prayer rug\\", on which recipients were encouraged to kneel and pray. This mailing, along with others, have been mentioned by the Attorney General of the State of Arkansas, among others, as not providing information about their financial and fundraising practices.State of South Carolina. Fraud Alert Task Force. Published March 21, 2005. While the ministry does hold tax exemption status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, it has been the subject of numerous complaints to the Better Business Bureau, whose evaluation conclusion was that the organization did not meet two standards for Charity Accountability.Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Guide ‚Äì St. Matthew's Churches.

In 1895, he founded the Lavazza coffee company in Turin. Biography Lavazza was born in Murisengo, a small city in the province of Turin (Piedmont). The origins of the Lavazza firm go back to 1895, when Luigi Lavazza purchased a little grocery store, Paissa Olivero, in the old commercial section of Turin (Northern Italy). The purchase was made for 26,000 Italian Lire, or about US$20. In those times such stores operated as both retail and production outlets. The coffee, sold among thousands of other products, was bought raw, and then roasted and blended according to very personal recipes depending on the customers' requests. This activity soon attracted the interest of Luigi Lavazza, who had already demonstrated considerable knowledge and skills in the processing of blends, including both the quantities of the ingredients and the degree of roasting. The firm's expansion from retailing to wholesale trade (1910), the joining of Luigi's three sons Mario, Beppe and Pericle (during the First World War), and the progressive narrowing of the production range marked the first steps of an irresistible commercial growth, which enabled the company to acquire a notable position at regional level. The little grocery store became in 1927 the modern Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. that, after the forced stop caused by the League of Nations' economic sanctions, by the prohibition on the importation of coffee, and by the outbreak of the Second World War, finally came to specialize in the production of coffee. The first Lavazza logo was then created, and the annual production reached 1,000 tons. In 1936 Luigi Lavazza retired and left the company to his children. He died in 1949. Since his death his family, from generation to generation, has devoted its energy to coffee and today Lavazza is claimed to be the market leader of espresso in Italy (with almost 45% of the total coffee market in 2004) and is present in over 60 countries. It is still based in Turin and is controlled by the fourth generation of Lavazza's descendants.

They are so varied and vaguely defined that they are rather a tradition than an archaeological culture. The N√∏stvet culture appeared around the Oslofjord and along the Norwegian coast up to Tr√∏ndelag, whereas the Lihult culture is found in western coastal Sweden. Sometimes the Sandarna culture appears as the name of an intermediary form between the Swedish Hensbacka and Lihult cultures. This name comes from a settlement near Gothenburg (approximately 7000 BC‚Äì5000 BC). The N√∏stvet people lived on open settlements. They used honed axes and microliths of various rocks, such as quartz, quartzite and flint. They lived primarily of hunting various animals such as seafowl and marine mammals, in addition to fishing and gathering. The size of the settlements grows over time, which reflects an increase in population and a more sedentary lifestyle.

This album was produced by Tiffany's former manager, George Tobin, with whom she had earlier split, and who had been widely criticized for his exploitative management style, but also widely credited for achieving Tiffany's pop success. However, this business relationship soon soured; according to Tiffany, this happened when she discovered that the songs Tobin had given her to sing on this album were previously used by another Tobin act, PC Quest.Paoletta, Michael. \\"Tiffany Tells Stories Her Way\\", Billboard, August 19, 2000, p. 1 Tiffany and Tobin went their separate ways, with Tiffany moving to Nashville and attempting a career as a country singer; this, however, never led to any record releases, and by 2000 she was back to pop music.

He was a recipient of the first Doctorate in Sciences awarded by Cornell University. Biography Joseph Charles (‚ÄúJC‚Äù) Arthur (1850‚Äì1942) was born in Lowville, New York, on January 11, 1850. Early in his childhood, his family moved to a farm near Charles City, Iowa, where he grew up. It was during that time that Arthur developed an interest in flowering plants. He was one of the first students to enroll at Iowa State College (now University) in 1869. Due to his interest in plants, he planned to study botany during college. Much to his dismay, no botanists were at Iowa State during his first year. In his second year, botanist Charles E. Bessey obtained a professorship at Iowa State and it was under his guidance that Arthur began his formal study of botany. To help facilitate Arthur‚Äôs studies, Bessey purchased a rust collection from the herbarium of Moses A. Curtis. Arthur graduated from Iowa State in 1872.Mains, EB. 1942. Joseph Charles Arthur (1850-1942). Mycologia 34: 601‚Äì605. In 1876, Arthur took a position as an instructor at Iowa State. He published his first paper that year, which was a catalog of the flowering plants of Iowa. It was during this time that he met E.W.D Holway, another noted botanist and mycologist. The two became friends and colleagues until Holway‚Äôs death in 1923. In 1877, Arthur received his Master's of Science (M.S.) at Iowa State. After that, he studied briefly at Harvard and Johns Hopkins University. From 1879 to 1881, Arthur was an instructor at the University of Wisconsin and then at the University of Minnesota during the following year. After his year in Minnesota, Arthur became the first botanist to work at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. This appointment was the first of its kind in the United States. There, most of his work was with bacterial or fire blight of pear. He was the first to establish that bacteria can cause plant disease.Arthur, JC. 1885. Pear blight and its cause. American Naturalist 19: 1177-1185. He was also the first plant pathologist to successfully execute Koch's postulates. In 1885, while still at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, he went to an AAAS meeting in New York City. During a break, botanist L.M. Underwood took Arthur to a pasture in the Bronx that was to become the future site of the New York Botanical Garden. Underwood confided in Arthur that the Garden was spearheading an effort to publish systematic descriptions of the entire North American flora and Arthur was most likely going to be in charge of the section on rust fungi. Arthur was elated by this news, as was the New York Agricultural Experiment Station where he was granted increased freedom to study rusts.Cummins, GB. Dr. Joseph Charles Arthur. Bulletin of the Purdue University Herbarium 1: 2-4. For his part, Arthur joined a consortium of collaborators to write 12 parts of the North American Flora, totaling 884 pages of descriptions, measurements, and host and distribution records of rust fungi. The first part was published in 1907 and the last in 1931.Arthur, JC. 1907-1931. Order Uredinales. North American Flora 7: 83-969. The year after Arthur earned his Doctor of Science from Cornell in 1886, he was appointed professor of botany at Purdue University, where he remained until his retirement in 1915. He was also the first botanist at the Purdue University Agricultural Experiment Station. Purdue continued to support his contribution to the North American Flora. One of his first accomplishments while at Purdue was determining that formalin could be used as a fungicide to control potato scab.Arthur, JC. 1897. Formalin for prevention of potato scab. Purdue University Agriculture Experiment Station Bulletin 65: 17‚Äì36. It was at Purdue where Arthur began over 19 years of culture experiments with American species of rusts.Arthur, JC. 1921. Nineteen years of culture work. Mycologia 13: 12-23. He was faced with the task of identifying a species concept appropriate for rust fungi, many of which exhibit up to five different spore types and can alternate between two hosts, known as heteroecism. The life cycle of rusts was not fully known for most species, so Arthur‚Äôs goal was to keep rusts under direct observation to note the succession of spore types. Heteroecism of North American rusts was unexplored at that point, so to find the alternate hosts for some species, he performed over 3750 inoculations with 2140 collections on potential hosts. Through those culture studies, Arthur realized the importance of host specialization to the delimitation of species. Arthur also introduced a greater emphasis on morphological, and especially microscopic characters, such as the number and arrangement of germpores on spores that had up to this point, not been considered in the taxonomy of rust fungi. Later, their taxonomic significance became shown. Cummins, GB. 1936. Phylogenetic significance of the pores in urediospores. Mycologia 28: 103-132. During his career, Arthur named 29 genera and 309 species in the North American Flora, and described an additional 50 species from South America, India and the Philippines, many of which he obtained from the collections of Holway. Arthur was a charter member of the Botanical Society of America (twice serving as President), the Mycological Society of America, American Phytopathological Society (where he also served as President), the American Association of University Professors, and many other learned societies. His first paper on the rust fungi was published in 1883 Arthur, JC. 1883. The interpretation of Schweinitzian and other early descriptions. American Naturalist 17: 77-78. and he continued publishing on the subject for over half of a century, his final publication appearing in 1934.Arthur, J.C. 1934. Manual of the Rusts of United States and Canada. Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue Research Foundation. 438 pp. Arthur Herbarium During his tenure at Purdue, Arthur accumulated over 40,000 rust specimens. Although he housed them at Purdue, Arthur considered these specimens to be his property because he financed most out of his own pocket. When Purdue disagreed, Arthur hired moving vans and quietly packed up the entire herbarium, including cabinets, and moved it to his house. This caused a standoff with Winthrop E. Stone, President of Purdue, who directed that he return all of the specimens, papers, drawings and notes related to his work with the North American flora to the herbarium. Ultimately an agreement was reached between Arthur and the Trustees of Purdue University to reimburse Arthur for expenses he personally incurred to build and maintain the herbarium, paying him the grand sum of $1450 amounting to 3.5 cents per specimen.Cummins, GB. 1978. Arthur: the man and his work. Annual Review of Phytopathology 16: 19-30. Today the Arthur Herbarium is located at Lilly Hall of Science at Purdue University and it still houses Arthur's priceless collections. The collection has grown to almost 100,000 specimens of rust fungi and is considered one of the most important holdings of these fungi in the world. It is currently directed by Dr. M. Catherine Aime. Personal life Arthur married Emily Stiles Potter of Lafayette, Indiana in 1901 and the two lived together until her death in 1935. His interests also extended into music. His premier piece was ‚ÄúVive Purdue.‚Äù Arthur died in 1942 in Brook, Indiana. He is buried in Lafayette.

In all continuities, he was once a great and honorable ninja whose story is always closely intertwined with that of Splinter: he was the owner of a pet rat who becomes Splinter in the original comics, original films, The Next Mutation, and the 2003 animated series, while Splinter was Hamato Yoshi in the 1987 animated series, the Adventures comics, the IDW comic series, the 2012 animated series, and the 2018 animated series. Comics Yoshi training in ninjutsu, with Splinter imitating him Hamato Yoshi was the greatest shadow warrior of the Foot Clan in Japan. He owned a rat named Splinter, who copied his movements as he practiced ninjutsu. He was romantically involved with a woman named Tang Shen. However, their relationship attracted the jealousy of Oroku Nagi, who also loved Shen. When Nagi was rejected by her, he became enraged and violently beat her. Shortly after, Yoshi arrived and, coming to Shen's defense, slayed Nagi. He was dishonored for having killed another member of the Clan and forced to choose between suicide or exile to another country. He chose the latter, and left with Shen and Splinter to the United States. Years later, Nagi's brother Oroku Saki climbed the ranks of the Foot to become the leader of its New York branch. He followed the two lovers to New York City and killed them both in vengeance of Nagi. However, the rat Splinter escaped to the sewer for safety. Some time later, Splinter witnessed a truck carrying toxic waste swerve to avoid colliding with a blind man as he crossed the road. A canister containing neon green glowing liquid fell into the sewers, while a boy coming out of a pet store dropped his four baby turtles into the sewers. Splinter and the four turtles came into contact with the radioactive substance and mutated into intelligent, humanoid beings. 1987 animated series & TMNT Adventures In the 1987 TMNT cartoon and the TMNT Adventures comics that followed, Hamato Yoshi and Splinter are the same character, and the romantic subplot was eliminated. In the Japanese dub of the 1987 series, his name is \\"Takeshi Yoshihama\\" ( Yoshihama Takeshi). Hamato Yoshi was once the Shidoshi of the Foot Clan in Japan. One of his students Oroku Saki framed him for attempted murder of a visiting master sensei, and had him exiled to New York, where Yoshi was forced to live in the sewers in shame, and befriended the rats. Years later, when Saki moved to New York himself, he dumped mutagen into the sewers to kill Yoshi. Instead, the mutagen caused Yoshi and his four pet turtles to mutate. Yoshi himself mutated into a humanoid rat, as the last animal he was in contact with before he stepped into the mutagen were rats, even though he picked up the turtles just after he touched the mutagen (he tried to clean the mutagen off of them right before they mutated into their humanoid forms). Yoshi took on the nickname \\"Splinter\\" as given to him by the turtles themselves because he could break wooden boards into splinters. He then proceeded to teach ninjutsu to the Turtles, to teach them self-defense because those who are different are feared by many. In the Season 2 episode \\"Splinter No More\\", Donatello finds a remedy to the mutagen effect and uses it to turn Splinter back into Hamato Yoshi. He thus returns to the surface and the streets, but finds it difficult to re-adapt into normal everyday human life. As the effects of the remedy soon wear off, Hamato Yoshi turns back into Splinter and returns to the Turtles with few regrets about leaving his human life behind. Films Yoshi's story, as explained in the first of the four TMNT movies, mirrors that of the comics, although Oroku Nagi is completely removed from the story, and Yoshi's conflict is with Oroku Saki himself. Hamato Yoshi is seemingly portrayed as a construction worker and Yoshi and Saki are portrayed as rival members of the same clan who constantly competed against each other, with their competition for Tang Shen's affections being particularly fierce. Instead of fleeing from the murder of a clan member, Tang Shen persuades Yoshi to flee to America to avoid fighting Saki (presumably to the death) for her hand in marriage. Saki vowed vengeance and spent years searching for them. Saki eventually finds and kills Yoshi and his wife in their New York apartment, leaving Yoshi's pet rat Splinter homeless. The actor who played him was uncredited. In the third Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, the turtles save a child named Yoshi from a burning building in 17th century Japan, Michelangelo getting him out of the building and Leonardo subsequently performing CPR. This Yoshi's relationship with Hamato Yoshi is never fully explained, but based on the past incarnation of another character that the turtles meet on this adventure (a possible British ancestor of Casey Jones, Whit) a direct relationship between this boy and Hamato Yoshi seems implied. If this is indeed the case, then by saving the boy's life, the turtles had also saved their own future, as their origin is inexorably tied to the fate of Hamato Yoshi. In the 2014 reboot, Hamato Yoshi does not appear anywhere in the turtle's new origin story. However Splinter remarks to April that he does not remember a time before living in Sack's laboratory. This implies there may be a wider story in the origin of the turtles and Splinter. 2003 animated series In the 2003 cartoon, Hamato Yoshi's background was once again thoroughly revised. He was no longer a former member of the Foot Clan. His new origins are described in the season 4 episode \\"A Tale of Master Yoshi\\". Hamato Yoshi was an orphan, who, along with his best friend Yukio Mashimi, begged in the streets of 1960s Japan. When Yoshi returned a 5-yen coin dropped by the Ancient One, he took the two of them in for his honesty, and raised them both as his sons, training them in the art of Ninjutsu. The two boys grew up together in the same house, and learning the same arts. Unfortunately, they both also loved the same girl, Tang Shen, another orphan the Ancient One had taken in. Tang Shen loved Yoshi more. During this time, Tang Shen spared a rat (Splinter) that had sneaked into the house, and took it as a pet. One night, Yoshi, Shen, and Mashimi observed a lone man being attacked by four ninja. The two young men decided to help him, and fought off the ninja, who were members of the Foot Clan. The man they saved was none other than the Utrom Mortu. Impressed by their skill, and having been partially exposed when his robotic arm was sliced off in the battle, Mortu gave Yoshi and Mashimi the offer to become Guardians, which they both accepted over the objections of their master. As a Guardian, Yoshi was promoted time and again, but Mashimi never seemed to advance. Mashimi grew jealous as Yoshi surpassed him in every way, and in his anger, he murdered Tang Shen and betrayed the Utroms to Ch'rell. Yoshi and the Utroms escaped. When Yoshi discovered what had happened he went into a rage, stormed the Foot's citadel and slew Mashimi in single combat. With their Tokyo headquarters compromised, the Utroms relocated to New York, under the name of TCRI. Yoshi went with them, taking along Tang Shen's pet rat, which he named Splinter, to remind himself of what he had done and what he had failed to do. The Shredder eventually tracked Yoshi down, and tried to force him to reveal the location of the Utroms. Yoshi resisted, and was killed for his defiance. Splinter witnessed the brutal scene, escaped and fled to the sewers, where he mutated along with the Turtles. He then proceeded to teach ninjutsu to the Turtles as he himself had learned it from Yoshi. In the \\"lost season\\" (Season 5), of the series, it is learned that Yoshi and the Ancient One had tried, in vain, to get the Ninja Tribunal's help in the fight against the Utrom Shredder. They refused as he was not the \\"true\\" Shredder even though the Utrom Shredder was growing in power. Due to their refusal to help, Splinter partly blamed the Ninja Tribunal for Yoshi's death. Yoshi, a former Battle Nexus champion, is seen in flashbacks of the history of the Battle Nexus. A statue of him is in the hall of champions of the Nexus, and next to him are statues of Splinter and Michelangelo, who won the following two tournaments. Before the Utroms departed Earth, they gave Splinter an orb that contained a hologram of Yoshi. That orb was destroyed by the Utrom Shredder's adoptive daughter, Karai, when she attacked the Turtles' lair in the episode \\"Scion of the Shredder\\". In the fifth season's final episode \\"Enter the Dragons Part II\\", a spirit of Hamato Yoshi appears, summoned by the combined power of the Turtles' dragon avatars, and defeats the Tengu Shredder, the aforementioned \\"true\\" Shredder. After delivering the final blow against the Tengu Shredder, he exchanges a brief greeting with Splinter before he disappears. 2012 CGI series Splinter is/was known as a wise sensei, a protective parent, a loving father, a stern disciplinarian, a quirky master, and a Zen philosopher. He was born Hamato Yoshi in Japan and was part of the Hamato clan until the destruction of his family - including his wife, Tang Shen and presumably his daughter, Hamato Miwa (later found), and his clan at the hands of Oroku Saki, later to be known as the Shredder. After arriving in New York in exile, he buys 4 turtles and while on his way, he is exposed to mutagen which changes him into a rat. In \\"'Tale Of The Yokai'\\", Oroku Saki (the Shredder) accidentally injures and kills Tang Shen while trying to kill Hamato and then takes away Miwa, much to Hamato Yoshi's despair and devastation as he believes that he lost all his family. The turtles save Hamato Yoshi from his death-which was in fact why they had \\"accidentally\\" ended up in the past-and go back to the present. In the Season 1 two-part finale \\"Showdown\\" it is revealed that Karai is Hamato Yoshi's biological daughter, Miwa, whom Shredder abducted after accidentally killing Tang Shen, to get back at him. In \\"The Wrath Of Tiger Claw\\", Yoshi shows Karai the same photo she carries of her mother Tang Shen, proving Oroku Saki has lied about being her father. In 'Vengeance Is Mine, Hamato Yoshi's daughter was mutated into a mutant snake, much to Hamato Yoshi's despair. In \\"The Invasion\\", Hamato Yoshi battles the Shredder, but loses and is left to drown until Karai saves him. In \\"Vision Quest\\" Hamato Yoshi's spirit (which was detached from the body) guides the turtles to face the spirits of the forest. In \\"Return To New York\\", April O'Neil, Casey Jones and the Turtles return to see that Hamato Yoshi lost his sanity (which April then heals). In \\"The Deadly Venom\\", Karai is brainwashed by Shredder's brain-worm as Hamato Yoshi teaches Leonardo \\"The Healing Hands.\\" In \\"The Fourfold Trap\\" Hamato Yoshi uses \\"The Healing Hands\\" to get rid of the worm that was possessing Karai. Unfortunately, much to Hamato Yoshi's despair, Karai fell and was flushed away into the sewers. Hamato Yoshi's healing hands worked because Karai was able to free herself from the brain washing worm. In the episode \\"Annihilation Earth\\", the Triceratons, another species of aliens that are antagonistic to the Krang, threaten to destroy Earth. Hamato Yoshi decides to seek help from Shredder while April informs him that if the Triceratons win, they will never find Karai again. Despite everyone trying to save Earth, everything fails. As Hamato Yoshi attempts to terminate the countdown of the Black Hole, Shredder kills him and the Turtles, April, and Casey are seen mourning. As Hamato Yoshi falls and closes his eyes, the black hole activates and sucks absolutely everyone in except for the turtles, April and Casey, who are rescued by a mysterious new ally known as the Fugitoid. The Fugitoid takes them back in time six months in an effort to prevent Earth's destruction, during which time Leo interacts with a holographic recreation of Splinter. Splinter himself later appears in \\"Trans-Dimensional Turtles\\" when the Turtles and their 1987 counterparts travel to the Turtles' lair on Earth. This gives the Turtles the opportunity to bid farewell to Splinter, though Leo is unable to inform him that they are in fact from the future. In \\"Earth's Last Stand\\" the events of \\"Annihilation Earth\\" are revisited, but the Turtles from the future arrive in time to warn Splinter of Shredder's attack. Splinter thus evades Shredder's strike and defeats him in a resulting duel, and the Earth is then saved by the efforts of the Fugitoid. A past version of Fugitoid then arrives to take the past Turtles, April, and Casey on an adventure, which-despite Splinter's initial misgivings-they willingly agree to, leaving only the set from the alternate timeline on Earth. In City at War, Splinter gladly promotes April to full kunoichi by presenting her with a tanto sword with the Hamato clan insignia. Upon hearing that her tanto was taken from her by a female witch- assassin, he assures April that failure is only possible when you give up. In Episode 114, \\"Lone Rat and Cubs\\" how he get turned into a mutant-rat and took in the infant Ninja Turtles as his adopted sons, 15 years ago, is fully revealed. 2018 animated series In the 2018 Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Splinter is Hamato Yoshi, his story is tied to mysticism and the Shredder, here a demonic suit of armor that consumed Oroku Saki, the man who first wore it. The Hamato clan, founded by Oroku Karai, was started to protect the world from the possibility of the Shredder returning after he was banished to another dimension, called the Twilight Realm. Yoshis mother left when he was a child, to fulfill her destiny and watch to make sure the Shredder never returned. She left Yoshi to be raised by his Grandpa Sho. As he grew into a teenager Yoshi resented his Grandpa Sho and the destiny of the Hamato clan. He didn‚Äôt believe that there was a 500 year old demon to watch for and resented the fact that it caused his mother to abandon him. Instead of learning how to defeat the demon Shredder, or use his Ninpo, magical abilities, he moved to America to make a name for himself in Hollywood. In Hollywood Hamato Yoshi adopted the stage name of Lou Jitsu and became an action movie star. As Lou Jitsu he was flashy, dated starlets and had a good time, he continued to ignore any attempt from his Grandpa show to get him to leave Hollywood, and come back to Japan to fulfill his supposed destiny. As see in ‚ÄúE-Turtle Sunshine of the Spotless Mind‚Äù At some point, while an action movie star, he founded a chain of dojos, by the time of the series proper (30 years since he‚Äôs been back to one) there is only one left in the city. As seen in ‚ÄúFists of Furry‚Äù Eventually Lou Jitsu fell in love with a woman and started dating her. On the day he proposed she revealed she was actually the yokai mob boss Big Mama, the proprietor of a yokai hotel, and the woman in charge of the Battle Nexus. Lou was kidnapped and forced to compete in the Battle Nexus, it is implied that most people who fight the Battle Nexus do not survive it. He was there for years, and while it seems everyone, even Splinter, recall the Battle Nexus as glory days, flashbacks show him as miserable and unhappy in his captivity. As seen in the episode ‚ÄúMany Unhappy Returns‚Äù While trapped he eventually gave up fighting entirely, and no longer would preform in the Battle Nexus or harm any living thing, but Big Mama would not let him go. He was broken out of his captivity by Baron Draxum, a yokai alchemist and warrior. Draxum believed that there was a threat to the secret yokai society from humans and sought to make warriors to fight for yokai. Draxum planned to use Lous DNA to mutate four turtles into warriors, since Lou was the greatest Battle Nexus champion ever. Lou, at first, made no move to stop or protest, until he saw the turtles that were to be molded into soldiers. He broke out of his captivity to spare them that fate, and in the ensuing escape was bitten by a rat he was also attempting to save, and drenched in ooze. As seen in the episode ‚ÄúGoyles, Goyles, Goyles‚Äù Yoshi abandoned his Lou Jitsu name and started going by Splinter sometime after escaping with the baby mutant turtles and set them up in a home in the sewer. Splinter spent a lot of time watching Lou Jitsu movies in an attempt to relive his glory days, he did not focus on training the turtles as ninjas, since he didn‚Äôt believe in the demon Shredder there was no threat for the turtles to train for. After seeing the machination of the Foot Clan when he noticed Aprils new work uniform from The Foot Shack, a front for the Foot in the episode ‚ÄúShadow of Evil‚Äù he resolved to make sure they could not summon back the Shredder. However, in the episode ‚ÄúEndgame‚Äù when the Foot captured all four turtles he traded them the helmet of the Shredders armor for them, the last piece they needed to summon back the demon Shredder. Splinter and Leo obtained a collar to banish the Shredder again in ‚ÄúMany Unhappy Returns‚Äù Splinter and the turtles continued to have adventures until the Shredder returns, now under the control of the Foot, using a magical ring connected to the banishing collar. The turtles searched Splinters memories to find a way to defeat the Shredder and summoned Karai back from the Twilight Zone. Shredder bore down on the lair and Splinter chose to remain behind to cover his sons escape from the Shredder. He was captured alive, with the intent to steal the innate magic he processed. The ritual was interrupted by the turtles, and after freeing Splinter they all worked together, with their ninpo, to destroy him for good.

It is the Administative Capital of Mopani District in the province and a former capital of the Gazankulu bantustan. The city of Giyani has Seven sections, Section A, Section D1, Section D2, Section E, Section F, Kremetaart, and The CBD. Risinga View and Church View are new development areas in Giyani, but are not incorporated to the city as yet. The CBD of Giyani is nicknamed \\"Benstore\\", as popularly referred to by the residents of the city. The District Municipality Council of Mopani seat is Giyani. Giyani is a city which is surrounded by a number of villages, which are administered by the Greater Giyani Municipality, which explains the rich Tsonga cultural activities surrounding the area. Prof. HWE Ntsanwisi, the former Chief minister of Gazankulu played a vital role in establishing the city. Giyani is situated at the intersection between R578 road (South Africa) and R81. It is located in the heart of Limpopo Bushveld, on the northern bank of the Klein (Little) Letaba River west of Kruger National Park. Situated in the northern portion of former Gazankulu, Giyani was established in the 1960s as the administrative centre for the Tsonga people. Giyani is now the administrative capital of Mopani District Municipality. Giyani lies 470 km north east of Johannesburg by road, 104 km from Tzaneen, 105 km from the Phalaborwa Gate of the Kruger National Park and 35 km from Malamulele. The 'Giyani Ward' at Elim Hospital was named after Giyani, the ward was opened in 1969 and since the first Gazankulu Legislative Assembly was convened at the same time (1969) when the new ward at Elim Hospital was being opened, the Gazankulu Government therefore named the ward at Elim Hospital 'Giyani Ward' in honour of the Gazankulu Capital city. Six years later in 1975, the Gazankulu Government named another newly built Ward at Elim Hospital 'Valdezia Ward' in honour of the first Swiss Mission Station in Valdezia, 10 km east of Waterval township. The Swiss Missionaries did mission work amongst the Tsonga people in the Hlanganani district of the former Gazankulu homeland. Later, the Swiss missionaries expanded its mission work to a large Tsonga settlement at Masana in Bushbuckridge and at Shiluvana settlement near Tzaneen. History Giyani was established during the 1960s as a capital City of Gazankulu, before the 1960s, the land where Giyani is situated belonged to Homu Royal Family.The name Giyani has been named by Hosi SDW Nxumalo. The Risinga Community came led by their headman Chabalala. The Risinga Community (under their headman Chabalala) originally came from the Elim district, next to the township of Waterval, above Elim Hospital, where they lived under the authority and were subjects of Paramount chief / Hosi of Elim. Before moving to Giyani during the 1880s, the Risinga Community were subject of Chief/ Hosi and occupied the land where the village of Shirley is situated today and were falling under Elim / Shirley Tribal Authority under Hosi . While still at Elim, Chabalala was an Induna to Hosi . The Risinga community moved to Giyani, along with the other Chabalala headman, Hosi Siyandhani Chabalala and the Mapayeni Community (under Headman Mapayeni Chavalala who settled at the bottom of Rhida hills) during the 1880s, in search of pastures for their livestock and settled on the foothills of Man'ombe Mountain,which belongs to Manombe royal family, similar to the lands they left behind at Elim/Shirley.Chief Man'ombe welcomed Risinga family and the Chavalala family. He placed Risinga at the place now known as Benstore and Chavalala at the place now known as homu 14B. The man'ombe family owned the whole land until the apartheid laws favoured the majority of people and gave the land to the Chavalala family, and recognised them as chief. At Elim District, the Risinga community left behind the other Chabalala headman, Nwa-Mhandzi Chabalala, who remained at Levubu river valley until the 1960s, when he was forcefully removed in terms of Group Areas Act and dumped at Bungeni village and became a headman of Hosi Bungeni.Headman Nwa-Mhandzi Chabalala is the only Chabalala headman left today at Elim district and has a big village called eka-Nwamhandzi under Hosi Bungeni. The entire land on the foothills of Manombe Mountain belonged to Manombe family who occupied the Ndauland called 'Madzime-N'ombe'and still is although it was wrongfully given to the Risinga Community until they were uprooted by the Apartheid Government to make way for the establishment of the town of Giyani. The Old Parliament Buildings at Giyani and the old Ministerial Houses as well as the Palace of the Chief Minister of Gazankulu were built on what used to be the Chief's Kraal and headquarters of the Risinga Community.Across the main road, the Risinga Community used to drive their herds of cattle for grazing at a place known today as Giyani Golf course. Giyani Section E, Section A, Section D1 and D2 and CBD of Giyani, known as Bendstore were villages of the Risinga Community. The Risinga Community was forcefully removed from their land during the 1960s in order to make way for a new Capital of Gazankulu and were relocated Homu Block 14 and Makoxa Village with their chief, Hosi Homu Chabalala. Upon their arrival at the foothills of Monombe mountain, they became independent and had their own chief, Hosi Homu Chabalala, he ruled the Homu Tribe which included the Risinga Community until they were expelled from Giyani during the consolidation of Gazankulu homeland. The name Risinga was replaced by 'Giyani' and the Risinga Community lost their land. The only thing that remain of the Risinga Community was a High School at Giyani section D2, named Risinga High School, the school was named after the Risinga chieftainship that was destroyed during the 1960s by the apartheid Government.The Mabunda Tribe, under chief/ Hosi Ngove, was situated not far from the Risinga Community, but was not their chief and chief Ngove or the Mabunda Tribe did not have Authority over the Risinga Community, the Risinga Community had their own independent chief, Chief Risinga. After the expulsion and removal of the Risinga Community in the 1960s, the Mabunda Tribe was allocated land that traditionally belong to the Risinga Community. All the lands where the town of Giyani is situated and surrounding lands belonged to the Risinga Community but the apartheid Government wrongly allocated that land to the Mabunda tribe and banished the Risinga Community into the wilderness at Homu Block 14. Land Claim The Risinga Community, under Hosi Homu Chabalala successfully claimed back their land, which includes; Giyani Section E, Section A, Section D1 and D2 and some parts of Section F, the whole of Man'ombe Mountain nature reserve and the entire Giyani CBD was given back to Hosi Homu Chabalala under the settlements scheme with Government. While the other Chabalala headman, Hosi Siyandhanim, successfully claimed some parts of Giyani Section E and section F and the western portion of Giyani CBD, Mapuve, Jim Nghalalume and Siyandhani as a host village. As well as Hosi Maswanganyi(Mavhusa) also successfully claimed back their land, which includes; Gandlanani, Basani, N'wamankena, Dingamadzi, Sikhunyani, Kremetart, Dzingidzingi A, B and C, Bode A and B, Mencisi and Maswanganyi Village. Even hosi Khakhala also successfully claimed back their land, which includes; Muyexe Block 01, Mninginisi Block 02, Mninginisi Block 03, N'wadzekudzeku Block 04, Shivulani Block 05A, Mbatlo Block 05B, Mavalani Block 06, Thomo Block 07, Khakhala Block 08A, Mhlava Block 08B, and Gawula Block 09 Village.

Winters are mild during the day and cold during the nights. Rainfall season is between September and March, while the winter season is from April to August. Culture Most residents of Giyani speak Xitsonga as their first language. The Tsonga women perform the xibelani dance'and called the dance Xigaza, the men enjoy mpuluto and makhwaya. The Tsonga people also engage in a custom dance called mchongolo.

The Tsonga people have their own distinct music when the xibelani dance is performed. The staple diet in Giyani is maize porridge (vuswa or pap in Afrikaans and rice often eaten with meat, chicken and vegetables (matsavu). Sports Giyani Stadium is the home of National First Division club Dynamos F.C. (South Africa) Giyani has been home to Giyani United and Giyani Classic. On the athletics front the 100 metre sprint ace Peter \\"Manero\\" Ngobeni stayed in Giyani section A during the 1980s. Economy Giyani's economy is predominately rural-based. Cattle ranching and producing maize, peanuts, tomatoes, potatoes, mangoes and bananas forms the backbone of farming. With the economic boom, Giyani has now become a major retail and entertainment centre for the local population. Modern shopping centres, with all the well- known chain stores presented, have vastly uplifted the local trade.  Residential areas  Giyani Section A, D1, D2, E,F and Kremetart are affluent residential areas in the city. There are new settlements closer to town but falling under Tribal Authorities such as Risinga view and Church view - Homu block 15 . Education Some of the independent schools in Giyani include Khanyisa Education Centre, Nkwangulatilo Education centre, Nyukani Education Centre, High Quality Education Centres, Giyani College of Technology and Management and Muhluri Combine School. =Tertiary Institutions in or near Giyani= *Giyani Campus Of Nursing College *Limpopo Province College of Nursing *Letaba FET College (Giyani Campus) *Giyani Education Multipurpose Centre Road The R81 is the major road that runs through Giyani. It links Giyani to Polokwane and Malamulele and joins the R524 to Punda Maria entrance gate of the Kruger National Park. It also joins the N1 to Pretoria and Johannesburg in Polokwane, next to the Mall of the North.  Tourism  Giyani's location in the warm African Bushveld makes it attractive for both local and international visitors. The Giyani Golf course is home to zebra, giraffe, bushbuck and some other herbivores, however the viewing of these animals has not yet been commercialized. At the moment, there are a number of Bed and Breakfast and Guest House facilities for tourists. A few are: Hanyani Lodge, Riverside Guest House, Xisaka Bed and Breakfast, Tihosi guest house, Elridge Mountain Lodge, Rosanna guest house,Nwayitelo Lodge and Mopani Guest House. Limpopo Lodge (formerly Giyani Hotel) is situated in the centre of town and managed by the Oasis Group. Man'ombe Nature Reserve is located 6 km east of Giyani. Giyani also borders Kruger National Park on the Western side of the Northern Region. Historically, Giyani had no entry-point to the Kruger National Park even though Giyani shares a long border with Kruger National Park. The plan to open a new gate at Giyani has been approved. The gate which is known as Shangoni Gate will be opened at Muyexe Village, 30 km North-East of Giyani town. This gate will bring much-needed development in the nearby villages of Muyexe, Mahonisi and Mtititi where unemployment is 80%.These villages have been historically poor, despite the fact that they are bordering one of the world best safari destinations. There are plans to develop state of the art conference facilities, sporting facilities and agricultural projects around the villages of Muyexe. Some of the project are sponsored by the Department of Rural Development. The upgrading of road from gravel to tar road is also underway between the villages of Muyexe and the town of Giyani. The road from Shangoni gate to Shingwezi Rest Camp will be constructed at a later stage. The new gate will cut the distance from Giyani to Shingwezi by almost 80 km. The visitors who want to visit Shingwezi Rest Camp from Gauteng by car can also shorten their itinerary by using this new route.

He played cricket for the West Indies and was the first person of known Chinese descent to play in a Test match. Left-arm unorthodox spin (left-arm wrist spin) was sometimes known as \\"slow left-arm chinaman\\" and thought to be named after Achong's bowling style. Achong was born in Belmont, Port of Spain. He played football as a left-winger for a local team, Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for playing cricket. He was mainly a bowler. His stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire, Joe Hardstaff Sr., \\"fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\\". Learie Constantine is said to have replied: \\"Do you mean the bowler or the ball?\\" An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed batsman) was sometimes known as a \\"chinaman\\" delivery as a result, although the term is now rarely used. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl unorthodox left-arm spin ‚Äì that is believed to be Charles Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English cricket team from 1930 to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 tour of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test figures belie his much greater success at regional level in the West Indies between 1929‚Äì30 and 1934‚Äì35. In the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament of 1931‚Äì32, he took 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana.British Guiana v Trinidad, 1931‚Äì32 He married during the 1933 tour of England and settled in Manchester.Obituary, Cricketer, November 1986, p. 86. After his last Test match, he continued to play cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking more than 1,000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \\"W\\"s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply. Achong later became a sports coach with the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education, coaching and selecting the Trinidad and Tobago cricket team. He died aged 82 in St. Augustine.

It was first released for the ZX Spectrum in 1985, and was then ported to the Amstrad CPC and BBC Micro later that year. It was also ported to the MSX exclusively in Japan in 1986. In the game, the player assumes the role of a knight who sets out to destroy four demons in a plague-infested village. The game features flip-screen and isometric gameplay, in similar vein to its predecessors, Knight Lore and Alien 8. In addition, Nightshade features an enhanced version of the Ultimate Play the Game's Filmation game engine, branded Filmation II. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised its gameplay traits, graphics and colours, however one critic was divided over its perceived similarities to its predecessors.  Gameplay  A green-hued, infected player character is pursued through the village of Nightshade by demons. The game is presented in an isometric format. The player assumes the role of a knight who enters the plague-infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four demons who reside within. Additionally, all residents from the village have been transformed into vampires and other supernatural creatures. Contact with these monsters infects the knight, with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green, which will lead to the character's death. The knight may be hit up to three times by an enemy, however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted. The objective of the game is to locate and destroy four specific demons. Each demon is vulnerable to a particular object which must be collected by the player: a hammer, a Bible, a crucifix and an hourglass. Once the four items have been collected, the player must track down a specific demon and cast the correct item at it in order to destroy it. Once all four demons have been destroyed, the game will end. In order to defend against other enemies such as vampires and monsters, the player can arm themselves with \\"antibodies\\", which can then be thrown at enemies. Antibodies can be found in houses around the village, and will slowly deplete once used by the player. Other collectible items include extra lives and boots, the latter of which enables the player character to run at a faster speed. Background and release Ultimate Play the Game was founded by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, along with Tim's wife, Carol, from their headquarters in Ashby-de-la- Zouch in 1982. They began producing multiple video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s. The company were known for their reluctance to reveal details about their operations and upcoming projects. Little was known about their development process except that they used to work in separate teams; one team would work on graphics whilst the other would concentrate on other aspects such as sound or programming. When a journalist reviewing Nightshade for Crash asked Tim and Chris Stamper what the object of the game was they responded: \\"oh, we can't tell you that\\". The game was developed with the isometric projection game engine known as Filmation II, an upgraded version of the Filmation engine. The Filmation engine was created by the Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an image masking technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered. Nightshade was first released in the United Kingdom for the ZX Spectrum in 1985, and was then ported to the Amstrad CPC and BBC Micro later that year. It was also ported to the MSX exclusively in Japan in 1986. Reception The game received positive reviews upon release. Chris Bourne of Sinclair User praised the game's new graphics system, opining that it was \\"wonderfully\\" detailed and \\"juiced up\\" in contrast to its predecessors, Knight Lore and Alien 8. A reviewer writing for Computer and Video Games praised the graphics as \\"great\\" and stated that its sound effects were \\"up to standard\\" considering the \\"dumb\\" ZX Spectrum. Philippa Irving of Crash thought that the visuals and use of colours were \\"stunning\\" and up to Ultimate Play the Game's \\"usual standards\\", however she did notice a few instances of attribute clash. A reviewer writing for Computer Gamer asserted that the graphics were \\"as good as ever\\", however they admitted that the game seemed \\"lacking\\" in comparison to Ultimate Play the Game's most recent releases. Chris Jenkins of Popular Computing Weekly opined that the game's interior visuals looked like \\"featureless squares\\", however he admitted that the game's background drops were more detailed. The gameplay was also praised by reviewers. Bourne opined that the game was well- paced in similar vein to arcade-style games, however he noted \\"a sense of d√©j√† vu\\" with the game's concept, stating that the developer's games were starting to \\"wear thin\\". The reviewer from Computer and Video Games appreciated Nightshades \\"nice touches\\", summarising that it was an instant classic from Ultimate Play the Game. Irving criticised the lack of instructions or hints that came with the game, and stated that Nightshade did not set new standards with programming, unlike Knight Lore and Alien 8. However, Irving admitted that the game was still another \\"technically brilliant\\" game. The reviewer from Computer Gamer enjoyed the wide range of gameplay elements, stating that it was enough to hold their attention for hours. A reviewer from Home Computing Weekly stated that the gameplay was not as addictive as Knight Lore or Alien 8 due to the game's lack of obstacles. Jenkins praised the game's use of its new engine, Filmation II, stating that it was ahead of \\"everything else\\" on the ZX Spectrum.

Llyn Celyn is a large reservoir constructed between 1960 and 1965 in the valley of the River Tryweryn in Gwynedd, Wales. It measures roughly long by wide, and has a maximum depth of . It has the capacity to hold of water.National Library of Wales page, \\"Celyn lake held a capacity of 71,200 mega litres of water, the biggest dam in Wales\\" It was originally to be named Llyn Tryweryn Mawr (meaning \\"Great Tryweryn Lake\\"), but in September 1964 Liverpool Corporation agreed to the name change following a letter from the Tryweryn Defence Committee.Capel Celyn, Ten Years of Destruction: 1955‚Äì1965, by Einion Thomas, published by Cyhoeddiadau Barddas & Gwynedd Council, 2007, Construction and opposition Construction of the reservoir for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks involved flooding the village of Capel Celyn and adjacent farmland, a deeply controversial move. Much of the opposition was brought about because the village was a stronghold of Welsh culture and the Welsh language, whilst the reservoir was being built to supply Liverpool and parts of the Wirral peninsula with water, rather than Wales. Liverpool Corporation's Tryweryn Reservoir Bill was presented in Parliament as a private bill in January 1957; by obtaining authority through an Act of Parliament, Liverpool City Council avoided having to gain consent from the Welsh planning authorities.BBC News: Tryweryn ‚Äì the drowning of a village Despite mass protests in Wales, and marches through Liverpool by Capel Celyn residents and their supporters, the legislation enabling the development was ultimately passed despite the opposition of 35 out of 36 Welsh Members of Parliament, with the 36th (David Llywelyn, Conservative MP for Cardiff North) abstaining. This led to an increase in support for the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, in the late 1950s and gave fresh impetus to Welsh devolution. The official opening was held on 28 October 1965. Representatives came from Liverpool City Council, and invitations were sent to all those with family links to the valley. In view of the anticipated protest, there was a strong police presence. The ceremony lasted less than three minutes, as protesters had cut the microphone wires, and the chants of the hundreds of protesters made the speeches inaudible.Eryl Crump, , ‚ÄùThe Welsh Daily Post‚Äù, 20 Oct 2015 In October 2005, Liverpool City Council issued a public apology for the incident. The full statement reads: > The Council acknowledges its debt to the many thousands of Welsh people who > have made their homes in the City. They have, in so many ways, enriched the > life of the City. We know that Liverpool, especially in the fields of > medicine and education, has been of real service to the people of Wales. We > realise the hurt of forty years ago when the Tryweryn Valley was transformed > into a reservoir to help meet the water needs of Liverpool. For any > insensitivity by our predecessor Council at that time, we apologise and hope > that the historic and sound relationship between Liverpool and Wales can be > completely restored., ‚ÄúBBC News‚Äù, 19 Oct 2005  Operation of reservoir  Tryweryn memorial chapel at Llyn Celyn The reservoir was built to help maintain the flow in the River Dee, so that drinking water could be abstracted further downstream as part of the Dee Regulation Scheme. These abstractions include one at Huntington water treatment works in Chester, operated by United Utilities, which supplies water to Liverpool and Wirral. The reservoir is contained behind a rock gravity dam and, at its upper end, it is bounded between Arenig Fawr and Arenig Fach, two of the mountains of south Snowdonia. The old B4391 road, disappearing into the western end of Llyn Celyn, August 1965. Water is released from the reservoir into the River Tryweryn which flows into the River Dee. Most of the water passes through a small hydro-electric plant to supply green electricity to the National Grid. The released water first flows into a stilling basin and then down the narrow and rocky valley of the River Tryweryn. This section of the river provides facilities for international level white-water canoeing, and rafting at the Canolfan Tryweryn National White-water Centre. Some water in the reservoir is held in reserve to be released down the river for specific whitewater events. Because the reservoir's principal purpose is to support low river flows in the main River Dee, the best conditions for such events occur during long dry spells in summer when maximum releases are made. Usually the dam will release between 9 and 11 m¬≥/s, although releases as low as 2 m¬≥/s and as high as 16 m¬≥/s have been known. During wet weather the releases are usually throttled back to a minimal maintenance flow unless a planned release for recreational activities has been agreed. Its four turbines are owned and run by D≈µr Cymru and generate 4.38 MWhttp://www.dwrcymru.com/en/Company- Information.aspx  Diversions and closures of transport links  The building of the reservoir also contributed to the final closure of the GWR branch line from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog.http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/six.htm penmorfa.com Passenger trains had ceased running in 1960, and the last freight train ran in 1961. The line was subsequently flooded by the lake, and the base of the dam also crosses it. Liverpool Council had in fact planned a railway diversion, but this was never built as the British Transport Commission had decided to close the line. As a result of this, Liverpool Council decided to contribute towards the cost of the new main road (the A4212, which was built across the pass from Bala to Trawsfynydd around the north side of the lake), and also towards the cost of a line linking the two stations in Blaenau Ffestiniog.

Weepu played most recently for Wairarapa Bush in the Heartland Championship. Generally Weepu played as a half-back but also played at first five-eighth on occasion. He has represented the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, between 2004 and 2013. He first won national honours against Wales in 2004. In 2005 was called back into the All Blacks squad for the first Tri Nations test against South Africa, having missed selection for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour. He represented the and in Super Rugby, and Wellington and Auckland in the Mitre 10 Cup. He also had brief spells with several clubs in Europe. In October 2017, Weepu announced his retirement as a rugby player. Early life Of MƒÅori and Niuean descent, Weepu hails from Wainuiomata. He attended Te Aute College where he was Head Boy in 2001.. After leaving school he played senior rugby with Hutt Old Boys Marist, under the tutelage of his mentor Derek Bruce, but returned to his roots and later joined Wainuiomata RFC with whom he remained affiliated throughout his professional career. New Zealand career =Domestic career= During the 2006 Super 14 Final, Weepu was knocked unconscious during an attempted tackle. However, due to the bizarrely thick fog during the match, the team doctors were unable to see that he had been unconscious. Weepu continued playing and went on to miss a tackle on Casey Laulala, conceding the match-winning try. Later Weepu admitted that he could not remember the game at all.https://web.archive.org/web/20061125041603/http://www.scrum.com/super14/2006/news/news_detail.asp?newsid=36067 =International career= Weepu was not selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup squad, announced on 22 July 2007, with Crusaders halfback Andrew Ellis preferred. During the 2011 Rugby World Cup Weepu played out of position in the last pool match against Canada, coming off the bench during the second half to play fullback as a replacement for Mils Muliaina. There was great pressure on the All Blacks to win the Cup, not having won it since 1987. This time round it looked to be New Zealand's year, but All Blacks playmaker Dan Carter was struck with a season-ending groin injury. This caused much media attention, and betting odds in favor of the All Blacks began to decrease. In the All Blacks vs Argentina quarter-final match, Weepu took on Carter's goal kicking duties. Landing seven penalties, with only a missed conversion, Weepu was named Man of the Match, helping guide New Zealand to victory, as well as earning him the nicknames \\"Mr Fixit\\" and \\"saviour\\". In the final against France he missed two penalties and a conversion; however, New Zealand emerged victorious due to a Tony Woodcock try and a Stephen Donald penalty. Weepu was left out of the All Blacks squad for the June tests in 2013, being told he needed to work on his speed and defensive ability. He was named in the squad for the late autumn tour of Argentina, but received little playing time. =Leading of the haka= Weepu was an integral part of the All Blacks when it came to performing the haka before each game. Of the 71 tests he played in he was the haka leader in 51 of them (12 November 2005 ‚Äì 22 June 2013); this is the most for any player since the introduction of Kapa o Pango in 2005. 26 times he led the Ka Mate version of the haka as well as 25 times the newer Kapa o Pango haka. Piri Weepu leads the Kapa o Pango haka for the All Blacks European career =England= Weepu signed to join London Welsh in July 2014 and left the Auckland Blues at the end of the 2014 Super Rugby season. On 27 February 2015, it was announced Weepu had been released early from London Welsh and would join fellow Aviva Premiership side Wasps on a short-term deal until the end of the 2014-15 season. =France= On 23 February 2015, it was announced Weepu would be joining Top 14 side Oyonnax on a two-year deal from the 2015-16 season. On 15 January 2016 Oyonnax have announced the termination of Weepu's contract with immediate effect, without giving any reason. Instead, on 28 November 2016, Weepu signed with Pro D2 club RC Narbonne with immediate effect during the 2016-17 season.

It was founded as an independent record label in 1987 by Craig Kallman with an emphasis on house music, and later hip hop. It was absorbed into Atlantic Records in 1998, and eventually relaunched separately in 2010 as a primarily electronic music label. Its current roster includes Dog Blood, Galantis, Whethan, Cash Cash, Ekali, and Clean Bandit. History =1987‚Äì1998: Original Big Beat= The first iteration of Big Beat was founded as an Independent record label in 1987 by Craig Kallman who was, at the time, a 20-year-old deejay in New York City. The company initially operated out of Kallman's bedroom where he recorded the label's first track, \\"Join Hands\\" by Tara Vhonty. That record sold 5,000 copies largely through direct promotion at record stores by Kallman himself. The second record Kallman recorded in his bedroom studio was titled \\"The Party\\" by Kraze which would go on to sell 250,000 units in the United States and internationally. Soon after, Kallman began focusing on developing the record label, signing acts like Tara Kemp and Jomanda over the following three years. He would sell Kemp's contract to Giant in 1991. Also that year, Jomanda released a record entitled \\"Got a Love for You\\" on Big Beat which attracted the attention of Doug Morris, the Co-Chairman of Atlantic Records at the time. Atlantic acquired Big Beat and made Kallman the Vice President of A&R; while he still operated Big Beat. As the 1990s escalated, the label's roster shifted from primarily house music to more hip hop music. Big Beat signed a variety of artists including Mad Skillz, Changing Faces, Robin S., Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lil' Kim (both via the company's Undeas imprint), Artifacts, Art n' Soul, Double X Posse, Kenny Dope, Dawn Penn, Marshall Jefferson, Todd Terry, Quad City DJs, Percee P, and numerous others. In 1998, the label and its roster were absorbed into Atlantic Records. In 2001, an attempt to relaunch Big Beat was planned, but ultimately abandoned. =2010‚Äìpresent: Relaunch= Big Beat was relaunched under Atlantic Records as a dance-focused label in 2010. Artists on the label at the time of the relaunch included Skrillex, Chromeo, Wynter Gordon, Martin Solveig, Teddybears, and others. The relaunched label's first hit came in 2010 with Wynter Gordon's \\"Dirty Talk\\" which reached #1 on the ARIA singles chart and the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart and was certified triple platinum in Australia. Martin Solveig's song \\"Hello,\\" which was released in 2011 in the United States, peaked at #46 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at #1 on the Dance Club Songs chart while also achieving Platinum status from the RIAA. Skrillex's Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP, released in 2010, effectively charted the label's trajectory toward electronic music. The EP sold hundreds of thousands of copies and its title track sold over 2 million copies and appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012, the EP was named the Best Dance/Electronic Album and its title track won Best Dance Recording. The following year at the 55th Grammy Awards, Skrillex again won Best Dance/Electronic Album for his Bangarang EP along with Best Dance Recording for the EP's title track which featured Sirah. He also won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non- Classical for his and Nero's remix of the Nero song, \\"Promises\\". In 2013, Big Beat signed Icona Pop, a Swedish electropop duo that would go on to release the 4x Platinum \\"I Love It\\" featuring Charli XCX. The label also signed Cash Cash‚Äîwhose 2013 single, \\"Take Me Home\\" featuring Bebe Rexha, was certified Gold‚Äî and Galantis around that time. In December 2013, Big Beat's parent company, Warner Music Group, acquired Parlophone (a German-British record label). As part of the terms of the deal, David Guetta was added to Big Beat's roster. In 2014, Clean Bandit released its album, New Eyes, on Big Beat. The lead single from the album, \\"Rather Be\\" featuring Jess Glynne, won the Grammy for Best Dance Recording at the 57th Grammy Awards in 2015. Liz Miller, Big Beat's General Manager in 2014, was named one of the \\"50 Most Important People in EDM\\" by Rolling Stone. In November 2014, David Guetta's first album with Big Beat, Listen, was released featuring the eventual double-platinum lead single \\"Hey Mama\\" featuring Nicki Minaj, Bebe Rexha, and Afrojack. In 2015, Skrillex released a collaborative album with Diplo entitled Skrillex and Diplo Present Jack √ú. At the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016, the album won the award for Best Dance/Electronic Album. Its lead single, \\"Where Are √ú Now\\" featuring Justin Bieber, won for Best Dance Recording. Galantis' 2016 single, \\"No Money\\" amassed nearly 700 million streams globally and charted on the Hot 100, Dance/Electronic Songs chart, and numerous other charts throughout the world. In 2017, Big Beat executives, Craig Kallman and Gina Tucci, were listed among Billboards list of \\"Dance Power Players.\\" Big Beat label mates Skrillex and David Guetta were also on the list.

It is also called Winnipeg goldeye, western goldeye, yellow herring, toothed herring, shad mooneye, la Queche, weepicheesis, or laquaiche aux yeux d‚Äôor in French. Morphology Goldeyes are recognizable by their silver compressed body form and their large gold eyes. Their body appears to be a blue-green silver from above and a more white silver from below. They have two abdominal and pelvic fins as well as a dorsal on their back and an anal fin on their underside. The dorsal fin is positioned opposite or behind the origin of the anal fin. Goldeyes also have a fleshy keel that extends from the pectoral fins to the base of the anal fin. Their mouth is large and in the terminal position with a blunt round snout. The Goldeye fish has cycloid scales that lack spines. They also have a sensory system known as the lateral line system. Adults are usually about 15-17 inches but can reach 20 inches.

This is a rare trait in fresh water fish, but is more common in marine fish. The eggs are suspended in the water and they drift downstream or to quiet waters. The majority of growth that occurs between June and September. Range It occurs from as far down the Mackenzie River as Aklavik in the north to Mississippi in the south, and from Alberta in the west to Ohio south of the Great Lakes, with an isolated population south of James Bay. It prefers turbid slower-moving waters of lakes and rivers. Diet Goldeyes feed on insects, crustaceans, fish, frogs. The fish averages less than 1 lb (450 g) or 12 in (30 cm) in length, but can be found up to 2 lbs (900 g) or 16 in (41 cm) in some lakes. It has been reported up to 52 cm in length. Fishing The goldeye is considered a good fly-fishing fish, but not popular with most anglers because of its small size. It is one of 122 new species of animals, birds, fish documented by the Lewis & Clark Corps of Discovery. Retrieved 2012-02-02 Commercial fishing of this species was reported as early as 1876. Its fresh flesh is soft and unappealing, so it was only taken randomly in gillnets and (in the past) sold for dogfood. They are now sought after by many consumers as a smoked fish. Many commercial fishermen sell them smoked after being processed (marinated) in a brine made of spices, salt, brown sugar, and other secret ingredients. They are smoked in oak wood, apple wood, or other woods. Each producer has their own ways of smoking. Despite its soft flesh the goldeye may be soaked in a salt brine for 24 hours and then poached, firming up the flesh. Two smoked Lake Winnipeg goldeyes purchased from a fisherman-owned business near Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba. Its commercial viability was realized by Robert Firth, who immigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hull, England in 1886. Firth was carrying on a mediocre trade in cold- smoked goldeye, when he miscalculated the heat of his smoker and accidentally developed the now-standard method of hot-smoking it whole. The bright red or orange colour of the smoked fish resulted from using only willow smoke, but today is achieved through aniline dye. It became a fashionable gourmet dish after 1911, with Woodrow Wilson and the Prince of Wales counted amongst its fans. In 1926‚Äì29 the annual catch exceeded a million pounds, but stocks declined from 1931 and little was fished from Lake Winnipeg after 1938. A small amount of the commercial harvest is shipped to the United States, but most is consumed in Canada. Although Lake Winnipeg was once the main commercial source, it now comes from elsewhere, especially in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and the culinary name Winnipeg goldeye has come to be associated with the city where it is processed. The fish is the namesake of Winnipeg's minor league baseball team, the Winnipeg Goldeyes.

It is now the second-largest city in Qinghai and the third largest in the Tibetan Plateau (after Xining and Lhasa). The population is now about 205,700. Name Golmud is a romanization of a Mongolian word meaning \\"rivers\\". Ge'ermu is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the same name's transcription into Chinese characters; it is sometimes misspelled Geermu. Ko-erh-mu was the same name romanized using the Wade‚ÄìGiles system; Golmot was the romanization used by the Chinese Postal Map. The Wylie romanization of the Tibetan form of the name is Nagormo. Geography Golmud is part of Haixi Prefecture in western Qinghai Province. Despite being nominally a \\"city\\", the built-up urban area of Golmud comprises only of the county's . Most of the county lies in the southern Qaidam Basin and in the foothills of the Kunlun Mountains. A large southern exclave is administered as the \\"town\\" of Tanggula, separated from the rest of the county by the western panhandle of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The northern part borders Xinjiang to its northeast; the southern exclave borders the Tibetan Autonomous Region to its southwest. Golmud proper is at an elevation of . It grew up alongside the Golmud River, which gave it its name. North of Golmud is the Qarhan Playa, a salt flat with about ten perennial salt lakes. The largest is Dabusun Lake, which receives the waters of the Golmud. The more important smaller lakes are Suli, South Suli, Dabiele, Xiaobiele, Tuanjie, Xiezuo, Dongling, and North and South Hulsan, which receive the waters of smaller inflowing streams. Qarhan is part of the larger Sanhu Depression, which includes East and West Taijinar Lakes. Other major lakes in the southern exclave of Golmud include Ulan Ul (), United States National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency and Migriggyangzham Co ()., United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency =Climate= Golmud has a cold arid climate (K√∂ppen BWk), with long, cold winters, and warm summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature drops to in January and rises to in July, while the annual mean is . Precipitation is very low, totaling only per annum, falling on 28 days, most of which are during the summer. Relative humidity averages only 32%, with all months below 40%, some of the lowest levels nationally. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 62% in July to 81% in November, the city receives 3,096 hours of bright sunshine annually.  History  Scientific exploration of the mineral resources of Qarhan were undertaken in the 1950s, leading to the discovery of the area's potash and gas fields. Systematic surveying was undertaken in the 1960s and 1970s, with the railway permitting industrial exploitation from the 1980s. The first oil pipeline and potassium fertilizer factory were opened in 1989. The Golmud Kunlun Economic Development Zone was opened in 1992. In 2004, a second pipeline arrived. In the 2010s, an influx of further investment followed realization of the importance of the Sanhu's supplies of lithium and rare earths for modern personal electronics and electric cars.

Economy  The Qarhan Playa has China's largest reserves of salt, potassium, and magnesium, as well as other valuable minerals. Taken together, the mineral resources in the playa were estimated to be worth over 15 trillion RMB (2002).. The area's salt has also trapped valuable hydrocarbons. The Sebei-1 and Sebei-2 fields near Suli Lake are also China's 4th-largest onshore reserves of natural gas and the entire area may have reserves as high as 1 trillion m¬≥ (35 trillion cu. ft.). The larger Sanhu Depression includes East and West Taijinar, which hold China's largest reserves of lithium. The surrounding countryside also produces gold, copper, jade, lead, and zinc. A pipeline delivers crude oil from Huatugou Oilfield to a refinery at Golmud. The refinery has a capacity of 1 million metric tons a year; is able to produce 100,000 metric tons a year of methanol and 20,000 MT/yr of polypropylene; and has a 100,000 MT/yr gas fractionator.

He was raised in a family famous for seafaring; at the age of 17 he was able to navigate ships. The exact date is not known, but ibn Majid probably died in 1500. Although long identified in the West as the navigator who helped Vasco da Gama find his way from Africa to India, contemporary research has shown Ibn Majid is unlikely even to have met da Gama. Ibn Majid was the author of nearly forty works of poetry and prose.  Works of the sailor Ibn Majid wrote several books on marine science and the movements of ships, which helped people of the Persian Gulf to reach the coasts of India, East Africa and other destinations. Among his many books on navigation, Kitab al-Fawa‚Äôid fi Usul ‚ÄòIlm al-Bahr wa ‚Äôl-Qawa‚Äôid (The Book of the Benefits of the Principles and Foundations of Seamanship) is considered as one of his best. It is an encyclopedia, describing the history and basic principles of navigation, latitude and longitude by way of celestial navigation, lunar mansions, loxodromes, the difference between coastal and open-sea sailing, the locations of ports from East Africa to Indonesia, accounts of the monsoon and other seasonal winds, typhoons and other topics for professional navigators. He drew from his own experience and that of his father, also a famous navigator, and the lore of generations of Indian Ocean sailors. The book encompassed the entire science of navigation in the Indian Ocean at the time. Ibn Majid was known as the Muallim (teacher), i.e. teacher of navigation. Most of his navigational calculations depended on astrology.  Legacy  Although Ibn Majid was long held to have helped the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama cross from Africa to the Indian subcontinent, contemporary research has shown that he would have been in his seventies at the time of da Gama's trip. The actual pilot who sailed with da Gama was a Gujarati and in fact returned to Portugal with da Gama. The man was provided to da Gama by the Ruler of Malindi and was, assumed da Gama and his men, a Christian. He guided da Gama's ships to Mount Eli on the Indian coast after a 23-day voyage. Researchers have also used the three rutters of Ibn Majid, particularly the ‚ÄòSofala Rutter‚Äô, to comprehensively debunk the entire story of Ibn Majid and any association with da Gama. The evidence in these, letters written by da Gama himself and Ibn Majid‚Äôs age (he considered himself too old to navigate ‚Äì in 1498, when da Gama arrived in Malindi, Ibn Majid would have been 77), all provide a strong refutation of the entire story and it is now accepted as highly unlikely that Ibn Majid had ever even met da Gama, let alone given him the route to India. However, his printed works are thought to have been a valuable source for the Portuguese when they arrived in the region. Remembered as 'The Lion of the Sea', ibn Majid's true legacy was the substantial body of literature on sailing that he left behind. Arab sailing was at a pinnacle during ibn Majid's lifetime, when both Europeans and Ottomans had only a limited understanding of geography in the Indian Ocean. His Kitab al-Fawa‚Äôid fi Usul ‚ÄòIlm al-Bahr wa‚Äôl-Qawa‚Äôid was widely utilized by Arab sailors and addressed celestial navigation, weather patterns, and charts of dangerous areas in which to sail. This tome, in addition to his poetic works, were the true legacy of the sailor. Two of ibn Majid's famous hand-written books are now prominent exhibits in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.  In popular culture  In the television series Star Trek: Picard, set in the future, the character Crist√≥bal \\"Chris\\" Rios (portrayed by Santiago Cabrera) is a former Starfleet officer who once served on the Federation starship USS Ibn Majid, NCC-75710, as revealed in the 2020 episode \\"Broken Pieces\\".

It combines the variable-length codes of Huffman coding with the coding of repetitive data in run-length encoding. The basic Huffman coding provides a way to compress files that have much repeating data, like a file containing text, where the alphabet letters are the repeating objects. However, a single scan line contains only two kinds of elements white pixels and black pixels which can be represented directly as a 0 and 1. This \\"alphabet\\" of only two symbols is too small to directly apply the Huffman coding. But if we first use run-length encoding, we can have more objects to encode.

After studying to become an electrician, he began to pursue a full-time acting career. He studied at the National Acting School in Novi Sad, Serbia and later enrolled at the Drama Arts Academy of the University of Zagreb. As a freshman, he was cast in the starring role of the 1960 Holocaust drama The Ninth Circle. A year later, he showed his versatility by appearing in the popular comedy Martin in the Clouds. This established Boris Dvornik as a big star of former Yugoslav cinema, comparable to Ljubi≈°a Samard≈æiƒá, Milena Draviƒá and Velimir \\"Bata\\" ≈Ωivojinoviƒá (with whom he later developed a close friendship). The zenith of Dvornik's popularity came in the 1970s with the role of Roko Prƒç in the cult series Na≈°e malo misto. In the 1980s, after receiving acclaim as of one of the most renowned and prolific actors of the former Yugoslavia, Boris Dvornik mostly worked with the Croatian National Theatre in his native city of Split. Over the years Dvornik developed a close friendship with Antun Vrdoljak. He talked him into getting involved in politics and in the 1992 elections Dvornik, as candidate of HDZ, was elected in the Split constituency. He soon realised that he had not the taste for politics and resigned his seat one month later. In more recent years, Dvornik's career was affected by aftermath of a stroke and alcohol abuse, which manifested in a series of incidents, the most notorious being assault on a poll observer during the 2005 presidential elections. Dvornik's two sons - Dino Dvornik and Dean Dvornik - were both renowned pop musicians. Boris Dvornik suffered a stroke and died in the city he was born in, Split, on 24 March 2008, aged 68.

Unlike a fixed charge, which is created over ascertained and definite property, a floating charge is created over property of an ambulatory and shifting nature. Examples of such property are receivables and stocks. The floating charge This conversion of the floating charge into a fixed charge (called \\"crystallisation\\") can trigger common law jurisdictions it is an implied term in security documents creating floating charges that a cessation of the company's right to deal with the assets (including by reason of insolvency proceedings) in the ordinary course of business leads to automatic crystallisation. Additionally, security documents will usually include express terms that a default by the person granting the security will trigger crystallisation. In most countries floating charges can only be granted by companies, LLPs or similar entities with separate legal personality. If an individual person or a partnershipAlthough not a limited liability partnership with separate legal personality. was to try to grant a floating charge, then in most jurisdictions which recognise floating charges this would be void as a general assignment in bankruptcy.For example, under English law, a general assignment of book debts by a natural person is void as regards book debts that were not paid before the presentation of the bankruptcy petition, unless the assignment has been registered under the Bills of Sale Act 1878 if the person goes into bankruptcy. See section 344(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986. Floating charges take effect in equity only, and consequently are defeated by a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any asset covered by them. In practice, as the chargor has power to dispose of assets subject to a floating charge, so this is only of consequence in relation to disposals that occur after the charge has crystallised. History The floating charge has been described as \\"one of equity's most brilliant creations.\\"By Roy Goode writing in Getzler & Payne, Company Charges - Spectrum and Beyond at page 11, The first recorded English case where a floating charge was recognised was In re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co (1870) 5 Ch App 318. The use of such floating charges increased in popularity and expanded rapidly until, as Lord Walker described it: \\"The floating charge had become a cuckoo in the nest of corporate insolvency.\\" at paragraph 130. Criticism of the effect of floating charges grew, until Lord Macnaghten finally proclaimed in :At [1897] AC 22, 53 This led to a push back against the effect of floating charges in the form of the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897. Definition :\\"A floating security is an equitable charge on the assets for the time being of a going concern. It attaches to the subject charged in the varying condition in which it happens to be from time to time. It is the essence of such a charge that it remains dormant until the undertaking ceases to be a going concern, or until the person in whose favour the charge is created intervenes. His right to intervene may of course be suspended by agreement. But if there is no agreement for suspension, he may exercise his right whenever he pleases after default.\\" Later in Illingworth v Houldsworth [1904] AC 355 at 358 he stated: :\\"...a floating charge is ambulatory and shifting in nature, hovering over and so to speak floating with the property which it is intended to affect until some event occurs or some act is done which causes it to settle and fasten on the subject of the charge within its reach and grasp.\\" A description was subsequently given in Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association [1903] 2 Ch 284, and despite Romer LJ clearly stating in that case that he did not intend to give a definition of the term floating charge, his description is generally cited as the most authoritative definition of what a floating charge is: * it is a charge over a class of assets present and future; * that class will be changing from time to time; and * until the charge crystallises and attaches to the assets, the chargor may carry on its business in the ordinary way. When conducting a recent review of the authorities, in keeping with that tradition, in National Westminster bank plc v Spectrum Plus Ltd [2005] UKHL 41, the House of Lords elected instead to describe the essential characteristic of a floating charge rather than define it, and they described it thus: :\\"the asset subject to the charge is not finally appropriated as a security for the payment of the debt until the occurrence of some future event. In the meantime the chargor is left free to use the charged asset and to remove it from the security.\\" Recharacterisation In National Westminster bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41 the House of Lords finally brought some clarity to this area of the law. The essential test of whether a charge was a fixed charge related to the chargor's power to continue to deal with the asset. In order to preserve the status of a charge as a fixed one, the bank must exercise actual control over disposal of the asset. If the chargor is able to deal with the asset, such as by drawing from the account in which charged funds are kept, or into which the proceeds of trade receivables are deposited, then the holder of the charge does not have effective control. Nature of the chargee's interest Several authorsWJ Gough, Company Charges (2nd edn, 1996) have suggested that the floating chargee, prior to crystallisation, may have no proprietary interest at all in the charged assets. However, this is inconsistent with cases (such as Spectrum) at the highest level which suggest a proprietary interest does exist. Alternatively, the floating chargee may have an inchoate type of proprietary interest, with characteristics that are proprietary but of a lesser order than the proprietary interest of a chargee with a fixed charge. Some authors have suggested that there is an interest in a fund of assets,R Goode, Legal Problems of Credit and Security (3rd edn, 2003) but the nature and incidents of the interest remain unclear. This has received some judicial support, from Lord Walker in Spectrum, for example. Another possibility is that the holder of a floating charge may have the same quality of proprietary interest as a fixed chargee, but one that is subject to defeasanceS Worthington, Proprietary Interests in Commercial Transactions (1996) or overreachingR Nolan, 'Property in a Fund' (2004)120 LQR 108 by permitted dealings by the chargor with the charged assets. History Historically, floating charges are a fascinating concept in that they are legal devices created entirely by lawyers in private practice; there is no legislation and no judicial decision that was the genesis of a floating charge. In 1862 in an apparently unconnected decision of Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HL Cas 191 it was held that equity would recognise a charge over after-acquired property as being effective to create a security interest over that property automatically upon its acquisition. This decision lead to \\"a further manifestation of the English genius for harnessing the most abstract conceptions to the service of commerce.\\"Commercial Law, Roy Goode, 2nd ed., at page 731 Documents came to be drafted that purported to grant security over all of the debtor's present and future property, but by contract expressly permitted the debtor to dispose of those assets, free from the charge, until such times as the debtor's business ceased. This charge came to be known as the \\"floating charge\\". The first case in which a floating security device was tested and upheld came a mere eight years after Holroyd v Marshall in In re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co (1870) 5 Ch App 318; a remarkably quick gestation by any reckoning. The Court of Appeal held that the effect of the document was that the secured creditor could not interfere with the running of the business and its dealings with its own assets until the winding up of the company, but the occurrence of that event entitled the secured creditor to realise its security over the assets and to assert its charge in priority to the general body of creditors. Any residual concern about the efficacy of such charges were comprehensively ousted by the House of Lords in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22. Flexibility Floating charges are enormously popular as a security device for two principal reasons. From the secured creditor's perspective, the security will cover each and every asset of the chargor. From the charger's perspective, although all of their assets are encumbered, because the security \\"floats\\", they remain free to deal with the assets and dispose of them in the ordinary course of business, thereby obtaining the maximum credit benefit from the lender, but without the inconvenience of requiring the secured creditor's consent to dispose of stock in trade. However, in many jurisdictions, floating charges are required to be registered in order to perfect them; otherwise they may be unenforceable on the bankruptcy of the debtor. This registration requirement has often led to other property rights (such as rights under a defective retention of title clause), which have been re-characterized as a floating charge being held to be void for non-registration. Remedies Broadly speaking, holding a floating charge gives the secured creditor two key remedies in the event of non-payment of the secured debt by the company. Firstly, the secured creditor can crystallise the charge, and then sell off any assets that the charge then attaches to as if the charge was a fixed charge. Secondly (and more frequently the case, to preserve the company as a going concern), if the floating charge encompasses substantially all of the assets and undertaking of the company, the secured creditor can appoint an administrative receiver to take over the management and control of the business with a view to discharging the debt out of income or selling off the entire business as a going concern. In countries that permit the making of an administration order, the floating charge had another key benefit. The holder of a floating charge could appoint an administrative receiver and block the appointment of a court-appointed administrator, and thus retain control of the distribution of the assets of the company. Practice became such that companies were asked to give \\"lightweight\\" floating charges to secured lenders which had no collateral value purely to allow the holders to block administration orders, an approach that was approved by the courts in Re Croftbell Ltd [1990] BCC 781. In the United Kingdom the law has now been changed by statute, but the power to block appointments of administrators has been retained in many other common law jurisdictions. =Crystallisation= Strictly speaking, it is not possible to enforce a floating charge at all - the charge must first crystallise into a fixed charge. In the absence of any special provisions in the relevant document, a floating charge crystallises either upon the appointment of a receiver or upon the commencement of liquidation.Re Crompton & Co Ltd [1914] 1 Ch 954: \\"...I think there can be no question at all that according to ordinary principles the winding up puts an end to the period of suspension; and the reason that it does that is that the effect of the winding up is to put an end to the floating nature of the security\\" at 963 It has also been suggested, relying upon obiter dictum comments by Lord Macnaghten in Government Stocks and Securities Investments Co Ltd v Manila Rly Co that a charge should also crystallise upon the company ceasing to trade as a going concern.Lingard, Bank Security Documents, 3rd ed. at para 9.19 However, this view is not yet supported by judicial authority.Although in Robson v Smith [1895] 2 Ch 118 Romer J did assert that a company could deal with assets subject to a floating charge until it is wound up or stops business. However, in Re Woodroffes (Musical Instruments) Ltd [1986] Ch 366 Nourse J he referred to earlier authorities assuming the cessation of business would cause crystallisation rather than deciding it. In certain countries, notably Australia and New Zealand, it was for a time very common to include \\"automatic crystallisation\\" provisions which would provide that the floating charge would crystallise upon an event of default automatically and without action from the chargee. Automatic crystallisation provisions have been upheld in New ZealandRe Manurewa Transport [1971] NZLE 909 but there are judicial comments suggesting they may not be recognised as effective in Canada.Referred to by Lord Hoffmann in Re Brightlife Ltd [1986] 3 All ER 673 at 678 In the United Kingdom there is some inferential support for the validity of automatic crystallisation provisions,In Evans v Rival Granite Quarries Ltd [1910] 2 QB 979 Buckley LJ referred to an event occurring which \\"is defined as bringing to an end the licence of the company to carry on business\\". In Re Bond Worth Slade J referred to \\"some other agreed event\\" as affecting crystallisation. but they have never been subject to full judicial consideration. Priority The main purpose of any security is to enable the secured creditor to have priority of claim to the bankrupt party's assets in the event of an insolvency. However, because of the nature of floating charge, the priority of floating charge holder's claims normally rank behind: # holders of fixed security (such as a mortgage or fixed charge);This was confirmed in Wheatley v Silkstone & Haigh Moor Coal Co (1885) 29 Ch D 715; because the disposition by the chargor (in creating the mortgage or fixed charge) is permitted by the concept of the floating charge, the grant of a mortgage or charge takes the relevant asset out of the pool of assets caught by the floating charge. and # preferential creditors, who are given priority by statute.See for example in the United Kingdom section 175(2)(b) of the Insolvency Act 1986 The floating charge cannot normally be enforced until it has crystallised (and thus, effectively, become a fixed charge) and so most statutes provide that the priority of a fixed charge that was created as a floating charge is treated as a floating charge.See for example section 29(a)(a) of the Insolvency Act 1986 Because of the differences in priority of fixed charges and floating charges, security documents came to be drafted to contain as many charges expressed to be fixed charges as possible, and leave as little as possible covered by the floating charge, where it would have secondary priority to the claims of the preferential creditors. A number of judicial decisionsCommencing with the decision of Slade J in Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142 gave conflicting interpretations over the characteristics that were definitive of a fixed charge, particularly with reference to charges over book debts (and a fixed charge that did not contain those characteristics would be \\"recharacterised\\" as a floating charge). The position was definitively resolved in NatWest v Spectrum Plus Limited when the House of Lords confirmed that a charge over book debts could be a fixed charge, provided that the secured creditor exhibited the necessary degree of control over the proceeds of the book debts. This would normally require that they either be paid into a blocked account, or that they be paid directly to the secured creditor. Any lesser degree of control was not consistent with a fixed charge, and such charges would be construed as floating charges, regardless of what label the parties had given them. Criticisms Floating charges have been criticised as a \\"raw deal\\" for unsecured creditors. In Salomon v. Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22 Lord Macnaghten observed that the injustice of the case (as he saw it) was not caused by the introduction of the concept of limited liability, but by the excessive security created by the floating charge. In Re London Pressed Hinge Co Ltd [1905] 1 Ch 576 Buckley J observed that great mischief arose from the very nature of the floating charge as few of general unsecured trade creditors of the company would even be aware of its existence. As most secured lenders will not usually have recourse to their security until the debtor company is in a parlous financial state, the usual position is that even all the remaining assets of the company are not enough to repay the debt secured by the floating charge, leaving the unsecured creditors with nothing. This perception has led to a widening of the classes of preferred creditors who take ahead of the floating charge holders in a number of countries. The introduction of a regime of voidable floating charges for floating charges taken just prior to the onset of insolvency is a partial response to these criticisms. Some countries have also sought to \\"ring fence\\" recoveries made for wrongful trading or fraudulent trading from the floating charge to create an artificial pool of assets available to the unsecured creditors. =Voidable floating charges= Because of the potential for abuse of a security interest that catches all of a company's assets, many jurisdictions have enacted provisions in their insolvency legislation providing that a floating charge granted shortly prior to the company going into liquidation will be invalid, or invalid to the extent that it does not secure new loans made to the company. =Registration= In many jurisdictions, because of their dramatic effect on the availability of assets to unsecured creditors on an insolvency, floating charges are required to be registered.For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 860 of the Companies Act 2006 Analogous security interests =United States= An analogous (but not identical) concept in the United States to the floating charge is the floating lien, which was implemented by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The U.S. never adopted the floating charge directly because at the time it was developing in England in the 19th century, U.S. courts generally held that a debtor simply could not create a security interest in future property; general creditors ought to have a pool of unencumbered assets to look to; and even if such a thing could exist, it was a fraudulent conveyance.Gerard McCormack, Secured Credit under English and American Law, (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004), 109. However, creditors' lawyers gradually developed an diverse variety of methods, some authorized by state legislatures and others tolerated by state courts, to evade the general ban on security interests in future property. As it had become clear that creditors and debtors were going to find ways to create enforceable de facto security interests in after-acquired property and general intangibles whether courts liked it or not, the UCC drafters in the 1940s (particularly Grant Gilmore) successfully argued that such interests should be legitimized and simplified in the form of the floating lien. A critical difference between the floating charge and the floating lien is that UCC security interests, including floating liens, can be granted by any kind of debtor, including individuals or partnerships (and will thus have priority in bankruptcy), whereas the floating charge can be granted only by corporate entities. =Quebec= When the Quebec Civil Code came into force in 1994 and superseded the Civil Code of Lower Canada, it abolished the charge flottante \\"floating charge\\" and created and introduced an analogous security device into Quebec law under the name hypoth√®que ouverte, or \\"floating mortgage\\". As a mortgage, it *can be taken over immovables and movables (that is, real and personal property); *must be in due form, i.e. passed before a notary and registered; *confers rights in rem: priority ranking, right of pursuit (that is, it runs with the land and cannot be defeated by a bona fide purchaser), creditor's consent required to dispose of subject; *grants powers of recourse: repossession, judicial foreclosure, sale by mortgagee in possession, or administrative receivership. The floating mortgage can be specific or general with respect to immovables and movables, separately or together. The mortgage is not perfected until it crystallises. Crystallisation occurs upon default of the mortgagor and registration of a notice of default, and the mortgage ranks from the date notice is filed. This means that a floating mortgage ranks lower than a fixed mortgage.Vilaysoun Loungnarath, Jr., L'Endettement de l'entreprise au Qu√©bec : param√®tres juridiques, [pdf]: https://www.usherbrooke.ca/droit/fileadmin/sites/droit/documents/RDUS/volume_26/26-1-loungnarath.pdf, accessed 22 August 2011. =Civil law countries= Civil law countries generally allow for a commercial pledge to be taken over the pooled movable assets held or acquired for the use of a business or income-producing activity (going concern) and not for sale. The pool is restricted to movable (personal) property of a long-term nature and of value to the operation of the business, or in other words: *inventory (UK: stock); * fixed assets ** movable tangibles: trade fixtures, equipment, machinery, tools, furniture; and ** legal intangibles: company style (name), logos, goodwill, intellectual property, leases. The pledge never crystallises like a floating charge; instead the pool is a universitas rerum and treated as a single movable security subject. The asset pool is referred to as a fonds de commerce (French), fondo de comercio (Spanish), fondo di commercio (Italian), Gesch√§ftsfonds (German), handelsfonds (Dutch), and so on. Besides the class of assets secured, the civilian commercial pledge differs from a floating charge in that fixed assets are not always changing, and the creditor ranks prior to all secured and unsecured claims.Al Tamimi & Company, Banking & Security Law in the UAE, [brochure], p. 24: http://www.tamimi.com/files/Legal%20Brochures/BaningandSecurityLaw.pdf , accessed 23 September 2011. Commercial pledges exist in common law countries but are usually taken over working capital (floating assets and investments).

The most famous brand produced was Wards Best Bitter. History =Early years= In 1837, William Roper and John Kiby started a brewery and business on Effingham Street. Roper died in 1842, leaving John Kiby in sole control. He was joined by George Wright in 1860. =S. H. Ward= Septimus Henry Ward joined the company in 1868 when it ran into financial trouble. Due to the substantial amount he had invested, the primary brand was renamed Wards Best Bitter. George Wright left the partnership a year later. The business continued to expand by buying up other breweries and associated public houses. In 1876, it bought the SOHO Brewery and made it its main premises, renaming it to Sheaf Brewery. It was made a limited company called S.H. Wards & Company Limited in 1896. The company continued to expand in the twentieth century by acquiring and restoring pubs. This was halted by the onset of the Second World War due to a lack of raw materials. The brewery was hit by three incendiary bombs in 1940, which caused the death of four of its workers. Despite these setbacks, it recovered after the end of the war and continued restoring pubs. =Demise= In 1972, the company was acquired by Vaux & Associated Breweries and continued to brew bitter as a subsidiary. Despite still being profitable, the brewery was closed in 1999 as the Vaux company was broken up after an acrimonious takeover by financiers. Members of the Vaux founding family, the Nicholsons, attempted a management buyout of Wards but their offer was rejected. On the final day of operation, an unofficial celebration to mark the years of dedicated work of the Wards staff was held. The much respected operations manager, and former head brewer Paul Simpson (also an RNR officer) was parodied by one of the brewing operatives who wore a homemade sailor suit. Also on this last day, several 'generations' of the brewery's excise officers, including Lorraine Baker and David Bates, bought everyone else a beer by installing a barrel in the brewer tap, The Devonshire, across the road from the brewery. The cremated remains of the last brewery cat, once to be found in the Sample/Training Room, were spirited away and now rest in the house of one of the former excise officers. The land was sold to developers who demolished most of it to make way for luxury apartments. It was revealed later that the price achieved was several million pounds less than the buyout that would have saved this much-loved brewer. =Resurrection= The Wards brand was bought by the Double Maxim Beer Company in 2003 and is run as a subsidiary called Wards Brewing Company. After a successful launch of the bottled version (first brewed again by Robinson's of Stockport), and cask (originally re-brewed by Jennings of Cockermouth) all variants are now brewed by Maxim.

There he joined the Yuen Yuen Institute, in Tsuen Wan district in the New Territories, continued his education and became a Taoist monk. The Yuen Yuen Institute was established in 1950 by monks from Sanyuan Gong (Three Originals Palace) in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, which in turn traces its lineage to the Longmen (Dragon Gate) sect of Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) Taoism. The Yuen Yuen Institute is dedicated to Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. In 1968, Moy co-founded, together with Taoist Masters Mui Ming- to and Tang Yuen Mei, the temple for the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism (FLK; Penglai ge, Ëì¨ËêäÈñ£) on the grounds of the Yuen Yuen Institute.Daoist Organizations in North America In addition to his studies and education in Taoism Moy Lin-shin learned a range of internal martial arts including Liuhebafa (Lok Hup Ba Fa, ÂÖ≠ÂêàÂÖ´Ê≥ï li√πh√© bƒÅ f«é), T'ai Chi Ch'uan (Â§™Ê•µÊã≥ t√†ij√≠ qu√°n), Hsing I Ch'uan (ÂΩ¢ÊÑèÊã≥ x√≠ng Y√¨ Qu√°n), Bagua (Baguazhang, ÂÖ´Âç¶Êéå b√† gu√† zh«éng) and Taoist Qigong (chi kung, chi gung, Ê∞£Âäü q√¨g≈çng). Moy's main teacher was Yang Liu (Êù®ÂÖ≠) (Cantonese: Yeung Luk), a Daoist hermit teaching Qigong and Tai Chi. Moy was the most senior disciple (of only 5 disciples) of Yang Liu. The second disciple was Ng Pak Shing, who opened a school in Canada after Moy died but has gone back to China since. Another one of Moy's main teachers in Hong Kong was Leung Ji Pang (Liang Zi Peng, or Leung Ji Pang, Ê¢ÅÂ≠êÈµ¨) (1900‚Äì1974), an instructor in Liuhebafa and other arts, who was in turn a student of Wu Yi Hui.Water-Spirit Forms Moy was taught Liuhebafa in Hong Kong by Liang Zipeng. Moy also trained in Hong Kong with Sun Di, a fellow student of Liang Zhi Peng, who Moy said had developed skills in Hsing I Chuan and Push hands (ÊäºÊâã YƒÅsh«íu). After 1975, Moy would travel back to Hong Kong on an annual basis to keep learning from Yang Liu and Sun Di. He would bring some of his senior students along on occasion. Move to Canada Moy went overseas with a mission of spreading the understanding of Taoism and its practices. After some travel, he settled in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and in 1970 began teaching a small group of dedicated students. In those early days, Moy taught both the health and martial arts aspects of Tai Chi. Upon moving to one of Toronto's \\"Chinatowns\\" a few years later, he changed his focus, emphasising mainly the health promoting and personal development aspects of tai chi, although Moy still did place strong emphasis on tai chi push hands practice and sometimes demonstrated other self-defense aspects of tai chi as well. Moy started with a standard Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan form, also saying he had mixed in elements of other internal arts, and taught it to condition students to learn Lok Hup Ba Fa later. Moy called this modified form Taoist Tai Chi. Moy emphasized the non-competitive nature of his style of teaching and of the form (see explanation in here). A teacher of Taoist Tai Chi is asked to conform to and live by what Moy called, \\"Eight Heavenly Virtues\\": * Sense of Shame * Honor * Sacrifice * Propriety * Trustworthiness * Dedication * Sibling Harmony * Filial piety In accordance with these virtues, Taoist Tai Chi is a form that is taught by volunteers. Organizations To promote his understanding of the Taoist foundations of Tai Chi and to facilitate understanding between eastern and western cultures, Moy helped to set up a number of organizations. Initially he established the Toronto Tai Chi Association, which, after Taoist Tai Chi chapters were formed across Canada, became the Taoist Tai Chi Society (ÈÅìÊïôÂ§™Ê•µÊã≥Á§æ) of Canada. After expansion into the United States and later into Europe, New Zealand and Australia the International Taoist Tai Chi Society was established in 1990. In 1981 Moy Lin-shin and Mui Ming-to established a Canadian branch of the Hong Kong-based Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism, which became the religious arm of the Taoist Tai Chi Society. This occurred with the opening of a Fung Loy Kok high shrine at the Society's Bathurst Street location in Toronto. They subsequently established other branches of Fung Loy Kok in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. This Institute maintains altars to the Taoist deities, i.e., the Jade Emperor (Chinese: ÁéâÁöáÂ§ßÂ∏ù, or Emperor in Heaven), Guanyin (Chinese: Ë¶≥Èü≥. One of the mythological female deities in Buddhism), and L√º Dongbin (Chinese: ÂëÇÊ¥ûË≥ì. One of the eight Chinese mythological \\"Transcendants\\", who became Immortals via \\"Inner Alchemy\\"). Initially Moy concentrated on teaching just Tai Chi forms and later emphasized other internal arts. In 1988 Moy established the Gei Pang Lok Hup Academy, which is dedicated to the memory of his teacher Liang Zipeng. It was established with the intent to teach the internal martial arts other than Tai Chi, mainly Liu He Ba Fa.International Taoist Tai Chi Society - Lok Hup Ba Fa Over the years, Moy Linshin not only taught Tai Chi and Liu He Ba Fa but also Daoist Meditation, Yiquan Zhan Zhuang and Qigong, a Hybrid Xingyiquan-Yiquan form from Sun Di, Yang Style Tai Chi Sword and Yang Style Tai Chi Saber, a long list of Foundation exercises (Jibengong) and some Baguazhang. The organizations since his death Since the death of Moy Lin-shin in 1998 the three organizations he founded have been amalgamated, with the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism as the main organization and the Taoist Tai Chi Society and the Gei Pang Lok Hup Academy as part of the Institute. This brought together the financial and administrative management of the three organizations. In order to broaden the emphasis on health and vitality, the Taoist Tai Chi Health Recovery Centre was established in 1997 near Toronto, at Orangeville, Ontario. On the same grounds a Taoist Cultivation Centre was built between 2005‚Äì2006.September 6-8, 2007: Taoist Priests from Hong Kong's Fung Ying Seen Koon Temple to Partake in Orangeville Temple Grand Opening Criticism Moy Lin Shin has been criticized for being unqualified and for teaching a version of Tai Chi that is \\"not generally recognised as an authentic style of Tai Chi\\" although even critics have admitted that his efforts \\"did a great deal to introduce thousands to tai chi\\".

The name is from the Chinese gong jin meaning 'tidy' (meticulous brush craftsmanship). The gongbi technique uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely and without independent or expressive variation. It is often highly colored and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects. One of the better known Gongbi works is the Song Dynasty Scroll, 17 feet long and includes intricate details that most don‚Äôt pick up. It is one of many popular tourist attractions in China today, as it is updated regularly to try and show what modern China looks like compared to when it was created during the Song Dynasty. The term related to gongbi, jiehua (or \\"boundary painting\\"), refers to the accurate depiction of architectural forms aided by the ruler. History The gongbi style had its beginnings approximately 2000 years ago during the Han dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) when Han's political stability and its prosperity favored the advancement of the arts. These paintings peaked out between the Tang and Song dynasties (7th to 13th centuries) when these refined paintings were endorsed and collected by the royal families of China. To perfect this style the gongbi artists must totally commit themselves to these techniques. Only the wealthy could afford such artists. This style of art was accomplished in secret in royal palaces and private homes. Gongbi is one of the oldest Chinese painting techniques that feature narratives or high authority figures in them. Tools When using brushes to paint gongbi, there are specific types for contouring and colouring. There are four types of brushes for contouring; Hong Mao (red hairs), are used to draw thick strokes mainly for landscape and background visuals. Yi Wen is used for longer lines to paint clothing, for example. Ye Jing brushes are used to contour flowers and bedsheets. Xie Zhua is the finest contour brush used to paint strokes of dragonflies and specific detail in the painting. There are three sizes of brushes used to colour the surface of the painting: Da Bai Yun (large white cloud), Zhong Bai Yun (average white cloud) and Xiao Bai Yun (small white cloud). Rough drafts are usually drawn on rice paper. If there is only one draft, a special type of paper called Xuan paper is used. There are two different kinds of Xuan paper. One is called Shu Xuan paper (cooked rice paper). it is usually used for Gongbi. Another kind is Sheng Xuan paper (raw rice paper). It is usually used for Xieyi ( 'sketch-thought style painting'). The soft paper is able to absorb water well, best used for Chinese painting and calligraphy.http://www.chine- culture.com/en/chinese-painting/chinese-painting-gongbi.php; retrieved on 2014-04-3 Silk can also be used, which is sized as well. Process of the craft Gongbi requires drawing with fine lines first to represent the exaggerated likenesses of the objects, and then adds washes of ink and color layer by layer, so as to approach the perfection of exquisiteness and fine art. The practice of Gongbi is specifically on rice paper when sketching out the design and layout of the drawing. Typically, pencil is used before beginning the second draft with the tipped brushes. The variation and detail in strokes are important especially when layering each wash of ink on top of each other. There are upward and downward strokes used that emphasize detailed pictures such as facial features and insects. After hundreds of years, a technique was developed for all gongbi artists as a system. Lines are used first to contour the figure and determine the fine outlines of the painting. Modest colors are added to the painting that add onto a sense of nature; flamboyant colors are used when the content of the painting has accentuated lines. retrieved on 2014-04-3 Gongbi painters Listed chronologically: * Yan Liben (c. 600‚Äì673) * Zhang Xuan (713‚Äì755) * Zhou Fang (c. 730‚Äì800) * Gu Hongzhong (937‚Äì975) * Emperor Huizong of Song (1082‚Äì1135) * Tang Yin (1470‚Äì1524) * Qiu Ying (1494‚Äì1552) * Chen Hongshou (1598‚Äì1652) See also * Art movement * Creativity techniques * List of art media * List of artistic media * List of art movements * List of most expensive paintings * List of most expensive sculptures * List of art techniques * List of sculptors References Category:Chinese painting Category:Painting techniques ","title":"Gongbi"},{"id":"2458702","text":"Maurice Emmanuel 1930 Maurice Emmanuel (2 May 1862 - 14 December 1938) was a French composer of classical music born in Bar-sur- Aube,http://www.musicologie.org/Biographies/e/emmanuel_maurice.html a small town in the Champagne-Ardenne region of northeastern France. It was there where he first heard his grandfather's printing press which according to his granddaughter, Anne Eichner-Emmanuel, first gave him the feeling of rhythm.http://www.timpani-records.com/1c1194.php DVD Brought up in Dijon, Marie Fran√ßois Maurice Emmanuel became a chorister at Beaune cathedral after his family moved to the city in 1869. According to his granddaughter, Anne Eichner-Emmanuel, he was influenced by the brass bands on the streets of Beaune and by the \\"songs of the grape pickers which imprinted melodies in his memory so different from all the classical music he was taught in the academy of music.\\"Anne Eichner-Emmanuel, Grand-daughter of Maurice Emmanuel, Interview on accompanying DVD to the music CD on Timpani No. 1c1194 Subsequently, he went to Paris, and he entered the Paris Conservatoire, where his composition teacher was L√©o Delibes. However, Delibes' strong disapproval of his early modal compositions (Cello Sonata, Op. 2, Sonatinas No. 1, Op. 4 and No. 2, Op. 5)'The Pith and Marrow' by Harry Halbreich, an essay in the booklet notes to Timpani recording 1C1194 caused a rift between them and subsequently caused him to study with Ernest Guiraud also at the Conservatoire.http://www.naxos.com/person/Maurice_Emmanuel/26028.htmhttp://www.timpani- records.com/1c1194.phphttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008Y1OKQC At the Conservatoire he came to know Claude Debussy who was also a pupil there. In addition, he attended the Conservatoire classes of C√©sar Franck, about whom he wrote a short book in 1930 (C√©sar Franck: Etude Critique). Emmanuel pursued a notable academic career. He wrote a treatise in 1895 on the music of Ancient Greece, and was appointed professor of the history of music at the Conservatoire in 1909. His students included Olivier Messiaen and Henri Dutilleux. Emmanuel's interests included folksong, Oriental music, and exotic modes -- his use of these modes in various of his works had appalled Delibes, who had vetoed his entering for the Prix de Rome. Other appointments included choirmaster at the church of Sainte-Clotilde from 1904 to 1907, assisted by √âmile Poillot, during the tenure of organist Charles Tournemire. The compositions of Emmanuel, seldom heard today even in France, include operas after Aeschylus (Prom√©th√©e encha√Æn√© and Salamine) as well as symphonies and string quartets. Probably the creations of his most often performed now are his six sonatines for solo piano, which (like many of his other pieces) demonstrate his eclectic academic interests. The first of the sonatines draws on the music of Burgundy, while the second incorporates birdsong, the third uses a Burgundian folk tune in its finale, and the fourth is subtitled en divers modes hindous (\\"in various Hindu modes\\").

They are sometimes restricted to purchase by legal adults, especially erotic comics which include sexually explicit material. Early days Roger Sabin traces the history of adult comics back to the political cartoons published in broadsheets since the 19th century.Roger Sabin. Adult Comics: An Introduction (Taylor & Francis, 1993, , Routledge, 2005, ) p. 15 In the 1930s, there were clandestinely produced tijuana bibles ‚Äì rectangular, eight page pamphlets with black printing on cheap white paper. The artwork ranged from excellent to utterly crude and was sometimes also racist (Blacks were caricatured with huge lips and extruding eyes). Their stories were explicit sexual escapades usually featuring well known cartoon characters, political figures, or movie stars (without permission). Sold under the counter in places such as tobacco stores and burlesque houses, millions of tijuana bibles were sold at the height of their popularity in the 1930s. They went into a steep decline after World War II and by the mid-1950s only a small trickle of new product was still appearing on the market, mainly in the form of cheaply printed, poorly drawn and tasteless little eight pagers which sold for 10 cents each in run down candy stores and gas stations, circulating mainly among delinquent teenagers. Starting in 1932, Norman Pett drew a strip called Jane for the British Daily Mirror newspaper. The heroine would often find herself in awkward situations where she would lose her clothing for one reason or another. The strip was written to some extent for a military audience to boost the morale of troops away from home. Winston Churchill said that Jane was Britain's \\"secret weapon\\".https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1377473/Death-of-Jane-the- model-who-helped-win-war.html In the United States, pulp magazines such as Harry Donenfeld's Spicy Detective featured comics on heroines who lose their clothing, such as Adolphe Barreaux's Sally the Sleuth which debuted in 1934. Many of the early comic publishers got their start in the pulps with Donenfeld for instance going on to found DC Comics. Fiction House similarly started as a pulp magazine publisher, but in 1938, released Jumbo Comics featuring Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, the first of many scantily clad jungle girls. Fiction House comics routinely featured attractive women on the covers, a trend which later became referred to as 'good girl art.' In 1941, Quality Comics put out Police Comics featuring Phantom Lady, a scantily clad crime fighter. Fox Feature Syndicate eventually began publishing Phantom Lady where she was drawn by Matt Baker, one of the most famous 'good girl' artists. Milton Caniff started producing the comic strip Male Call in 1943, and Bill Ward came out with Torchy in 1944 featuring sexy heroines. Pulp magazines were also known for their violence. The Shadow carried two guns for killing criminals, and Batman also wielded a gun from 1939 through 1944 before giving it up. Crime and horror comics were popular genres in the late 1940s and early 1950s with such titles as Lev Gleason Publications' Crime Does Not Pay, EC Comics' Crime Suspenstories, Crypt of Terror, Tales From the Crypt and Vault of Horror all enjoying brief spells of interest. It is believed that EC had one of the best- selling lines at the time. Harvey Kurtzman was one of the key writers for EC, and artists such as Wally Wood or Al Williamson began to do research for each new story far beyond what had been seen in titles published up to that time. In the 1950s Irving Klaw published a line of underground fetish and bondage comics by artists like Eric Stanton, John Willie, and Gene Bilbrew. These never achieved widespread popularity but were kept in print for many years, sold through Klaw's mail order catalog to the same customers who bought his bondage photographs of Bettie Page. Not quite obscene enough to warrant prosecution, they skirted the limits of legality by avoiding full frontal nudity in their depictions. The Comics Code Authority In 1954, a psychologist Dr. Fredric Wertham came out with a book Seduction of the Innocent that claimed that the rise in juvenile delinquency being reported in the news at the time was fueled by comic books. He claimed that Batman and Robin were encouraging homosexuality, and decried the bondage seen in Wonder Women's book. EC Comics came under criticism for the graphic violence and gore seen in its crime and horror books. EC publisher William Gaines was called before a Senate committee to testify, but he remained defensive saying that he was already censoring the more extreme things from his books. Partly in order to avoid the government imposing a solution, the other major publishers banded together to form the Comics Code Authority which would screen comics before they went to press, and only allow the Code mark to appear if the comic passed their standards. The Code was alarmingly strict. It barred publishers from using the words 'crime,' 'horror' or 'terror' in their titles, thus forcing EC to abandon some of their most popular titles. Police officers could not be portrayed in a negative light, and if a villain committed murder, he would have to be caught and punished by the end of the story. No mention was allowed of vampires, werewolves or zombies, another swipe at EC. Years later when Marvel introduced zombies into their books, they had to call them 'zuvembies' in order to pass the Code. In general, DC and Marvel were supportive of the Code, but EC struggled to cope with the new rules, and eventually abandoned most of their titles to focus on Mad Magazine, which did not need Code approval. The code also contained provisions against suggestive or salacious illustration, and required that females be drawn realistically without undue exposure. This was a knock at Fiction House's good girl art covers, and may have contributed to Fiction House's closure. Magazines and comic strips North American comic books tend to be around 7 by 10 inches in size. Magazines vary, but are usually larger. Comic books tended to have a Comic Code label marking them as suitable for children, while magazines had no such requirement. This led to magazines becoming one of the most common formats for adult comics. Playboy magazine first came out in 1953. It would feature single panel cartoons by artists such as Alberto Vargas, Archie Comics artist Dan DeCarlo, Jack Cole, LeRoy Neiman and later Olivia De Berardinis and Dean Yeagle. In the mid 1960s, Playboy magazine started including a multipage strip called Little Annie Fanny by EC alumni Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder with an occasional assist from artist Frank Frazetta. Annie had trouble keeping her clothes on, a trend seen also in the strips The Adventures of Phoebe Zeit- Geist, Wally Wood's Sally Forth, and Penthouse 's Oh Wicked Wanda by Ron Embleton. Penthouse would later put out a number of erotic comic magazines: Penthouse Comix, Penthouse Men's Adventure and Penthouse Max with the likes of Adam Hughes contributing artwork. From 1965, Warren Publishing started publishing two black and white magazines, Creepy and Eerie, commissioning work from the artists who had worked on EC's horror line. Warren added Vampirella in 1969, and then the science fiction magazine titled 1984 (later 1994) starting in the year 1978. The large format of these titles meant that they could be sold with other magazines aimed at adults rather than displayed in comic racks where the child-oriented titles were found. The publishers of the American humor magazine National Lampoon discovered the French adult magazine M√©tal hurlant, and in 1977 started publishing Heavy Metal translating the work of Jean-Claude Forest, Jean Giraud, Guido Crepax, Milo Manara and Vittorio Giardino for an English audience. Heavy Metal also provided a forum for the work of American creators such as Richard Corben and Howard Chaykin. In 1983, Warren went bankrupt, but more recently, Dark Horse Comics has been reprinting some of Warren's old stories, and has revived the Creepy and Eerie magazines. Underground comics Adult comics continued underground in the late 1960s outside the umbrella of the CCA. The underground comics movement was spearheaded by creators such as Art Spiegelman, Robert Crumb, Harvey Pekar, Kim Deitch and Spain Rodriguez. Larry Welz appeared in the 1980s with his Cherry book, an underground-style erotic parody of Archie Comics. These titles were often sold at head shops, but these establishments were often at loggerheads with the police, sometimes making distribution difficult. Independent publishers In 1966, Wally Wood hit upon the idea of publishing his own comic, and selling it through comic book specialty shops. Recruiting star creators from among his friends, witzend featured one-off strips on a wide variety of themes by the likes of Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Frank Frazetta, Gil Kane and Art Spiegelman. Fantagraphics Books began in 1976, publishing the Comics Journal and later Amazing Heroes with text articles about the comics field, but they began publishing actual comics in 1982, notably Love and Rockets by Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez. In 1990, Fantagraphics established their Eros Comix imprint, reprinting titles by Wally Wood and Frank Thorne as well as Gilbert's Birdland. Canadian Dave Sim began publishing Cerebus in 1977, and Richard and Wendy Pini put out Elfquest starting in 1978, initially through their own WaRP company. Pacific Comics was formed in 1981, and became the first publisher of Dave Stevens's Rocketeer which was eventually made into a movie. Stevens modeled one of the characters on Bettie Page harkening back to an earlier era of clandestine publishing. Antarctic Press was founded in 1984, and publishes American manga and independent creators, notably Terry Moore's Strangers in Paradise. Dark Horse Comics was founded in 1986. Its first comic book was the adult-oriented anthology, Dark Horse Presents, which published Frank Miller's noirish Sin City, later made into a feature film. Avatar Press began providing a showcase for the works of Alan Moore and Al Rio in 1996. Top Shelf Productions was formed in 1997, publishing Moore and Melinda Gebbie's Lost Girls erotic graphic novel. Mainstream publishers The publisher of Marvel Comics in the 1960s, Martin Goodman, was also the publisher for a number of men's adventure magazines: Men, Male and Stag. In these magazines, they included a strip called The Adventures of Pussycat drawn by Wally Wood and Bill Ward. These strips were eventually collected, and released as a one-shot magazine in 1968. Inside, it is listed as being printed by Marvel Comics, but there is no Marvel logo on the cover, nor any Comics Code mark. The lack of a Comics Code mark came to be a subtle sign that one might find adult content inside. Intrigued by Warren's success with their black and white titles, Marvel Comics tried their hand at this field as well releasing Savage Tales starting in 1971, Tomb of Dracula in 1972 and Savage Sword of Conan in 1974. In 1974, Marvel even released three issues of Comix Book under their Curtis imprint featuring the work of underground creators. Heavy Metal 's success with glossy color science fiction and fantasy didn't go unnoticed either, and in 1980, Marvel released their Epic Illustrated magazine as well as a number of adult themed graphic novels under the Epic label. By 1986 though, they had cancelled Epic Illustrated, although Savage Sword of Conan continued running until 1995. By the 1980s, there was a growing trend towards grim and gritty anti-heroes and increasing violence in comics. Marvel Comics' Punisher received his own title in 1985, and in 1986, DC Comics' Watchmen by Alan Moore and The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller explored issues related to vigilantes. In 1986, DC Comics started publishing comics with the words \\"For Mature Readers\\" or \\"Suggested for Mature Readers\\" on their covers. These mature readers titles included The Shadow (1986), The Question (from #8 1987-), Slash Maraud (1987-8), Swamp Thing (from #57 1987-), Vigilante (from #44 1987-8), Wasteland (1987-), Batman: The Killing Joke (1988), Green Arrow (#1-62 1988-92), Haywire (1988-9), Hellblazer (1988-), Tailgunner Jo (1988-9), V for Vendetta (1988-), Blackhawk (1989‚Äì90), Deadman: Love After Death (1989), Gilgamesh II (1989), The Sandman (1989-), Doom Patrol (1990-), Shade the Changing Man (1990-), Twilight (1990), World Without End (1990-1), Mister E (1991), Animal Man (1992-), Deadman: Exorcism (1992) and Mighty Love (2004). In 1993, DC started up their Vertigo imprint that allowed explicit content in selected titles, grouping a number of their mature readers titles together. Notable Vertigo titles include the Eisner Award winners, Fables, 100 Bullets, Preacher and The Sandman as well as several books that have been adapted into feature films, Hellblazer, A History of Violence, Stardust and V for Vendetta. In 2001, Marvel Comics withdrew from the Comics Code Authority, and set up their own content rating system, and an adult-oriented Max imprint. In January 2011, DC announced that they were withdrawing from the Comics Code as well, and the sole remaining CCA member Archie Comics withdrew the day after, bringing the code to its end. Female artists and writers Although most writers and artists of adult comics have been men, there have been a number of women working in the field. As mentioned above, Olivia De Berardinis contributes illustrations to Playboy magazine. Elaine Lee, a writer who has worked for both DC and Marvel, collaborated with artist Michael Kaluta to produce Skin Tight Orbit, a collection of adult short stories published by NBM for their Amerotica label. Wendy Pini has also worked for Marvel, but is perhaps best known for her Elfquest series which she produced with her husband Richard. Amanda Conner was one of the artists who worked on DC/Vertigo's Codename: Knockout. Melinda Gebbie was the artist who worked with Alan Moore on the erotic Lost Girls graphic novel. Giovanna Casotto is an Italian actress and artist who draws erotic comics.  Erotic comics  Some adult comics are pornographic, focusing substantially on sexual activity, either for its own sake or as a major story element. As such they are usually not permitted to be legally sold to minors. Some examples grew out of the underground comix scene, such as Cherry by Larry Welz, which parodied Archie Comics. Omaha the Cat Dancer by Kate Worley and Reed Waller combined sexually explicit material with a melodrama featuring anthropomorphic animals. XXXenophile by Phil Folgio blended science fiction and fantasy scenarios with sexual situations. Early comics produced for gay and bisexual male readers often focused on sexual situations, such as Kake by Tom of Finland and Harry Chess by Al Shapiro. Although gay comics have expanded to cover a variety of genres, erotica has continued to be popular sometimes incorporated into other genres, such as the erotic superheroes published by Class Comics, the wordless graphic novels written by Dale Lazarov, and yaoi hentai produced in Japan. Europe The French comics anthology Pilote was published from 1959‚Äì89, and featured the work of adult-oriented creators such as Jean Giraud (Moebius), Guido Crepax, Caza and the American Robert Crumb. By 1974, Jean Giraud and some of his comrades had become dissatisfied with Pilote, and broke off to found the Metal Hurlant magazine to showcase adult comics in the science fiction or fantasy genres. In France in 1962, Jean-Claude Forest started producing a strip called Barbarella, set in outer space, but where the heroine found herself losing her clothing or ending up in sexual situations. By the mid-1960s, there were quite a few comic strips featuring sexually-liberated heroines: Modesty Blaise and Mayfair 's Carrie by Don Lawrence in England, The Adventures of Jodelle in France, Isabella (by Sandro Angiolini) and Valentina in Italy. In 1977, the British anthology 2000 A.D. first appeared, and featured the work of many writers and artists who were to become influential in the adult comics field in the U.S. later, notably Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons who created Watchmen and Neil Gaiman who went on to work on The Sandman. Another popular British magazine is Viz which parodies earlier British comics anthologies with an injection of incongruous sex or violence. While 2000 A.D. is adventure- oriented, and Viz focused on potty humor, Raymond Briggs tried to give British comics a more serious tone with works such as When the Wind Blows about an older couple trying to come to terms with the aftermath of a nuclear attack. In 1978, the Belgian company Casterman started putting out the magazine √Ä Suivre attracting submissions by many of the same contributors who were seen in Metal Hurlant. Catalan Communications and more recently NBM Publishing have also published adult works from Europe mostly as standalone graphic novels, although NBM now has an anthology magazine called Sizzle. Horacio Altuna is an Argentine artist who has done many four page strips for Playboy Magazine's Spanish, Italian and German editions. Japanese manga In Japan, comic books (manga) intended for adults are usually divided into 'seinen manga' (ÈùíÂπ¥Êº´Áîª comics for men) and 'josei manga' (Â•≥ÊÄßÊº´Áîª comics for women). Erotic comics aimed at men are referred to as 'seijin-muke manga' (Êàê‰∫∫Âêë„ÅëÊº´Áîª) or 'ero manga' and those aimed at women are called 'ladies comics' („É¨„Éº„Éá„Ç£„Éº„Ç∫„Éª„Ç≥„Éü„ÉÉ„ÇØ) (see also the English loanword 'hentai'). Shonen manga for boys tend to outsell seinen manga which in turn outsell seijin-muke manga.Japan Magazine Publishers Association Magazine Data 2007 Some of the first specialized manga magazines were aimed at adult men. Weekly Manga Times debuted in 1956, and originally focused on erotic fiction and 'porno manga'. Weekly Manga Goraku first came out in 1964, and was also aimed at the relatively older demographic of men from their 30s through to their 50s. Manga Action and Young Comic debuted in 1967, followed by Big Comic in 1968, with Weekly Young Jump following in 1979, and Weekly Young Magazine in 1980. Manga with the word 'young' in the title tend to be aimed at a younger demographic of 15-30s.

Before 2010, it was known as the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (SUSDP).. The SUSMP classifies drugs and poisons into different Schedules signifying the degree of control recommended to be exercised over their availability to the public.. , the most recent version is the Poisons Standard July 2020. The Schedules are referred to under State and Territory legislation for regulatory purposes. Although each State and Territory has its own laws, the vast majority of medicines and poisons are classified according to the SUSMP to achieve uniform national regulation.  Schedules  = Schedule 1 = Schedule 1 is blank. Schedule 1 does not currently contain any medicines or poisons. = Schedule 2: Pharmacy Medicine = Schedule 2 (S2) drugs and poisons, otherwise known as Pharmacy Medicines, are substances and preparations for therapeutic use that ‚Äì * are substantially safe in use but where advice or counselling is available if necessary; * are for minor ailments or symptoms that ‚Äì ** can be easily recognised by the consumer and ** don't require medical diagnosis or management. Examples: * Dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant * Simple analgesics such as aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen in packs containing more than 24 tablets (packs containing up to 24 tablets of simple analgesics are unscheduled, and can be sold in any shop) * Hyoscine, used to treat motion sickness, postoperative nausea and vomiting. * Nonsedating antihistamines such as loratadine * Nasal sprays containing decongestants or steroids The SUSMP March 2018 defines a Schedule 2 substance as \\"Substances, the safe use of which may require advice from a pharmacist and which should be available from a pharmacy or, where a pharmacy service is not available, from a licensed person.\\" The location of these medications in the pharmacy varies from state to state. = Schedule 3: Pharmacist Only Medicine = Schedule 3 (S3) drugs and poisons, otherwise known as Pharmacist Only Medicines, are substances and preparations for therapeutic use that ‚Äì * are substantially safe in use but require professional advice or counselling by a pharmacist; * require pharmacist advice, management, or monitoring; * are for ailments or symptoms that ‚Äì ** can be identified by the consumer and verified by a pharmacist; ** don't require medical diagnosis, or only require initial medical diagnosis, and don't require close medical management. Some states have subsets of Schedule 3 with additional requirements (see below). Only some Schedule 3 medicines may be advertised to the public. Examples: * Orlistat (trade name Xenical) * Pseudoephedrine (marketed in Cold and Flu preparations) * Salbutamol (Ventolin/Asmol) = Schedule 4: Prescription Only Medicine = Schedule 4 (S4) drugs and poisons, otherwise known as prescription only medicines, are substances and preparations for therapeutic use that ‚Äì * require professional medical, dental, or veterinary management or monitoring; * are for ailments or symptoms that require professional medical, dental, or veterinary diagnosis or management; * may require further evaluation for safety or efficacy; * are new therapeutic substances. The price of many Schedule 4 substances are subsidized by the Australian Government through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), when prescribed by an authorized prescriber. Certain medications may require an authority from the PBS. Situations that may require an authority include where the drug may only have benefit in limited conditions, the true cost of the drug is high, or when there is a risk of dependence. Some states have subsets of Schedule 4 with additional requirements (see below). Schedule 4 medicines cannot be advertised directly to the public. Examples: * Amoxicillin * Anabolic steroids * Apomorphine * Cannabidiol in preparations for therapeutic use containing 2 percent or less of other cannabinoids found in cannabis (since June 2015). * Cisplatin * Co-codamol preparations comprising codeine and paracetamol * Ephedrine * Ergotamine * Estradiol * Fluticasone * Ibogaine * Isotretinoin * Methoxyflurane * Pseudoephedrine in large doses * Salmeterol * Tramadol * Tretinoin * Trimethoprim * All benzodiazepines except flunitrazepam and alprazolam * All: **SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine, citalopram), **SNRIs (e.g. duloxetine, milnacipran), **TCAs (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine) **MAOIs (e.g. selegiline, moclobemide). * Antipsychotic drugs (e.g. aripiprazole, quetiapine) = Schedule 5: Caution = Schedule 5 (S5) drugs and poisons are substances and preparations that must have appropriate packaging and simple warning labels to display that these poisons: * have low toxicity or a low concentration; * have a low to moderate hazard; * can cause only minor adverse effects to the human being in normal use; * require caution in handling, storage, or use. = Schedule 6: Poison = Must use distinctive packaging and strong warnings to display the potential for: * moderate to high toxicity; * that may cause death or severe injury if ingested, inhaled, or in contact with the skin or eyes. = Schedule 7: Dangerous Drug = Substances with a high potential for causing harm at low exposure and which: * Require special precautions for manufacture, handling or use; or * Only available to specialised and authorised users with appropriate skills * Special regulations regarding their availability, possession, storage or use may apply = Schedule 8: Controlled Drug = Schedule 8 (S8) drugs and poisons, otherwise known as Controlled Drugs, are substances and preparations for therapeutic use which have high potential for abuse and addiction. The possession of these medications without authority is an offence. Like schedule 4 substances, the price of many Schedule substances are subsidized through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), some of which may require an authority. In addition, in some states, all drugs on schedule 8 require a doctor to have an S8 permit before prescribing treatment. For example, in NSW the prescribing of Schedule 8 CNS stimulant medication (e.g., methylphenidate, dexamfetamine) requires authorisation from the NSW Ministry of Health (Pharmaceutical Services) and is generally restricted to specialists, such as paediatricians and psychiatrists. A GP (General Practitioner) cannot initiate the treatment, although they can prescribe in very limited circumstances, e.g. co-prescribing on behalf of the specialist; and in rural areas, if the patient has been diagnosed with ADHD, a GP may apply for the authority to prescribe. Patients who may require Schedule 8 CNS stimulant medication should be referred to a specialist for assessment. Examples: * Alprazolam * Amphetamine * Barbiturates (most) * Buprenorphine / Suboxone *Carfentanil *Cocaine * Codeine (single ingredient) * Dexamfetamine * Dronabinol * Fentanyl * Flunitrazepam * GHB * Hydrocodone * Hydromorphone *Ketamine * Methamphetamine * Methylphenidate * Morphine * Nabiximols * Opium * Oxycodone * Pethidine = Schedule 9: Prohibited Substance = Schedule 9 (S9) drugs and poisons are substances and preparations that, by law, may only be used for research purposes. The sale, distribution, use, and manufacture of such substances without a permit is strictly prohibited by law. Permits for research uses on humans must be approved by a recognized ethics committee on human research. Examples: * 2C-B * Benzylpiperazine * Bromo-DragonFLY * Cannabis, except when separately specified in other Schedules *Coca leaf * DMT * Harmine/Harmaline * Heroin *Kratom, also known as Mitragyna speciosa; as well its main alkaloid Mitragynine * MDMA * MDPV *Mephedrone *Mescaline * Methaqualone * Methoxypiperamide * LSD * Psilocin * Psilocybin * Salvia divinorum = Schedule 10: Substances of such danger to health as to warrant prohibition of sale, supply and use = Schedule 10 was known as Appendix C until the introduction of the Poisons Standard 2015. It includes substances of such danger to health as to warrant prohibition of sale, supply and use. Examples: * Borage for therapeutic use * Coal tar for cosmetic use * Juniperus sabina for therapeutic use * Oxyphenisatin for therapeutic use * 2,4-Dinitrophenol for human use = Unscheduled substances = Unscheduled substances don't belong to any of the above schedules. Many of these preparations are also sold in supermarkets in addition to pharmacies. Examples: * Antacids * Ephenidine * Hydroxymorphinan * Ranitidine in small packs (larger packs are schedule) * Paracetamol 500 mg in small packs (<24; larger packs are schedule 2) * Some laxatives (e.g. bulk laxatives Metamucil) * Lubricant eye drops * Nicotine replacement therapy (some preparations are schedule 2)  Interstate variations  = New South Wales = In New South Wales, poisons are proclaimed in the Poisons List by the Poisons Advisory Committee, under the authority of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW). NSW legislation refers to S2 as \\"medicinal poisons\\", S3 as \\"potent substances\\", S4 as \\"restricted substances\\" and S8 as \\"drugs of addiction\\".  Schedule 3 Recordable  Schedule 3 Recordable (S3R), or \\"recordable potent substances\\", refers to Pharmacist Only Medicines where supply is recorded as for Schedule 4 drugs. S3R drugs are those that may have an increased risk of illegal diversion or abuse. These are specified in Clause 23 of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2002 (NSW). As of January 2006, all pseudoephedrine-containing preparations are S3R.  Schedule 4 Appendix D  Schedule 4, Appendix D (S4D) refers to Prescription Only Medicines that don't have sufficient addictiveness or risk of abuse to be classified as S8, but for which a significant addiction/abuse risk exists. As such, S4D drugs are subject to additional prescription and recording requirements over S4. These drugs are referred to as \\"prescribed restricted substances\\" under the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2002 (NSW) and are listed in Appendix D of the Regulation. Drugs included in Appendix D include benzodiazepines, anabolic steroids, gabapentinoids and opiates. A subset of Appendix D are the Appendix B substances, which are subject to similar requirements as S8 drugs. = South Australia =  Recordable S3 products (Schedule G)  In South Australia, supply of certain S3 preparations listed in Schedule G of the Controlled Substances (Poisons) Regulations 1996 (SA) are recordable under Regulation 14(2). As of 2006, Schedule G products specified are: adrenaline (in metered aerosols), dihydrocodeine (in cough preparations), doxylamine (in preparations also containing codeine), promethazine (in preparations also containing codeine), and pseudoephedrine. = Western Australia =  Recordable S3 products (Appendix J)  In Western Australia, supply of certain S3 preparations listed in Appendix J of the Poisons Regulations 1965 (WA) are recordable under Regulation 35A. As of 2006, Appendix J products specified are: hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone acetate, pseudoephedrine, and nicotine preparations were included in Schedule 3.

They are small (bell diameter to 25 mm) and hard to see when hanging onto swaying seaweed. Nevertheless, they are capable of swimming when necessary. The bell is transparent, revealing the four orange to yellowish-tan gonads that lie along most of the length of the four radial canals. The pale yellow manubrium has four short, frilly lips. Up to 80 tentacles line the bell margin, with about an equal number of statocysts. Copepods are a favored prey. This marine hydrozoan is common in warmer waters. The conspicuous stage in the dimorphic lifecycle is the small medusa. The polypoid stage is present as a tiny, solitary polyp which feeds on protozoans and other small plants and animals. The polyp stage closely resembles Hydra. The medusae are active swimmers that propel themselves upward in the water column by rhythmic pulsations of the bell. Upon reaching the surface, the bell relaxes, the tentacles become fully extended, and any small fish or crustaceans encountered as the medusae slowly drift toward the bottom are ensnared. Occasionally, the medusae use their adhesive pads to attach to seaweeds or other objects near the bottom, extend their tentacles, and wait for prey to bump into them. The manubrium hangs down from the center of the subrellum. It bears the cross-shaped mouth and the four short oral lobes which grip the food. Digestion begins in the center of the manubrium, which communicates with the four radial canals and the ring canal. The velum is well-developed and used in swimming. Having a velum is characteristic of the hydrozoan medusae. The gonads are four yellowish structures embedded in the surface of the epidermis beneath the radial canals. The ovaries are more granular in appearance than the testes (sexes are separate). The gametes are shed into the sea, and the zygotes develop into ciliated planular larvae which grow into minute polyps. These polyps can bud off other polyps or medusae. The tentacles of the medusae are hollow and connected to the exumbrellar surface by a tentacular bulb where cnidoblasts are formed.

For some states in Eastern Europe, the Eurasian Patent Convention applies. Patents having effect in most European states may be obtained either nationally, via national patent offices, or via a centralised patent prosecution process at the European Patent Office (EPO). The EPO is a public international organisation established by the European Patent Convention (EPC). The EPO is neither a European Union nor a Council of Europe institution.EPO web site, List of Contracting States of the European Patent Organisation: EPO contracting states. Retrieved on September 4, 2009. A patent granted by the EPO does not lead to a single European patent enforceable before one single court, but rather to a bundle of essentially independent national European patents enforceable before national courts according to different national legislations and procedures. \\"Prise de position des Avocats G√©n√©raux pr√©sent√©e le 2 juillet 2010\\", Opinion 1/09, Court of Justice of the European Union, July 2, 2010, point 4. Similarly, Eurasian patents are granted by the Eurasian Patent Office and become after grant independent national Eurasian patents enforceable before national courts. European patent law is also shaped by international agreements such as the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement), the Patent Law Treaty (PLT) and the London Agreement.  Types of patent protection in Europe  thumbRegional patent convention membership in Europe A characteristic of European patent law as it stands today is that European patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO), and patents granted by national patent offices are available, and may possibly ‚Äìif permitted by national law and, if so, to the extent permitted by national law‚Äì co-exist within a given jurisdiction. Utility models, referred to as \\"Gebrauchsmuster\\" in Germany and Austria, are available in some countries. Patent applications can be filed at the relevant national patent office or at the EPO. Alternatively, an international application may be filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and later nationalised in the desired countries or at the EPO. However, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Slovenia have \\"closed their national route\\" meaning that it is no longer possible to nationalise an international application in those countries directly and protection can only be obtained via the EPO.\\"European Patent Office web site, Accession to the PCT by Malta (MT), Information from the European Patent Office, January 2, 2007Latvia: Closing of the National Route via the PCT, PCT Newsletter of April 2007. = European patents = A European patent is the product of a unified grant procedure before the EPO under procedures established by the European Patent Convention (EPC). Before grant, a European patent application is a unitary legal entity. However, after grant, a \\"European patent\\" essentially ceases to have unitary character. Some of the 38 EPC Contracting States require the patentee to file a full translation of the granted European patent with the national patent office of the State if the text of the European patent as granted is not in one of their official languages. If the translation is not filed, the European patent is deemed to have no effect from the outset in that State. The London Agreement, which entered into force on May 1, 2008, significantly reduces the number of required translations in the states that are party to it. A central time-limited opposition procedure and central limitation and revocation procedures before the EPO are available however. The opposition procedure allows any person except for the patent proprietor to oppose a granted European patent in an attempt to have the EPO revoke or amend the patent. The opposition procedure may only be initiated within nine months of the grant of the European patent. The limitation and revocation procedures allow the patentee to centrally request the limitation or revocation of their own European patent. After the unitary European examination and opposition phase ends, nearly all \\"unitary\\" nature of the European patent dissolves, and what remains is a collection of essentially-independent national patents, and ownership, validity and infringement of each being determined independently under respective national law. provides that, in each member country, the national part of the European patent has the identical effect as a national patent with the identical claims would have. The European Patent Convention expressly adopts national law for all substantive attributes of a national part of a European patent, with the following exceptions: * standards for revocation - national law is expressly preempted, and grounds for revoking a national part are limited to five grounds specified in (subject matter, enabling disclosure, and claims beyond the content of the application as filed, protection has been extended or improper proprietor) - though each state is free to interpret the five grounds of Art. 138 under its own national law. * infringement by the direct product of a patented process * patent term, 20 years from the filing date. All other substantive attributes of each national part of an EP patent, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, what remedies are available for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for willful infringement, etc.), equitable defenses, coexistence of an EP national part and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law. \\\\- EPC Art. 2(2) \\"The European patent shall, in each of the Contracting States for which it is granted, have the effect of and be subject to the same conditions as a national patent granted by that State, unless this Convention provides otherwise.\\"; (patent term extension determined under national law); (EP patent conveys \\"same rights\\" as national patent, and infringment determined by national law; (EP filing has same effect as national filing); (ownership determined under national law) = Unitary patents= Countries may create unitary protection with regards to patents, which means that the effect (including revocation) is equal in all countries concerned. Such unitary protection was effected (both for \\"national\\" and European patents) by Switzerland and Liechtenstein in 1980 with the Treaty between the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on Patent Protection of 1978. = National patents = National patents are available in all European countries. In some European countries, national patents are substantively examined, while in other countries there is no provision for such examination and patents are thus granted only if formal requirements are met, while novelty and inventive step is not evaluated. It can be cheaper and tactically advantageous to apply for a few national patents rather than for a European patent at the European Patent Office. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Patents Act 1977 and the Patents Act 2004 establish the law relating to patents including filing, examination, grant, infringement, revocation, assignment. UK law is in many ways similar to the European Patent Convention (EPC) (although the EPC deals with very few post- grant activities). National patents may be the only available patents in European states that are neither party to the European Patent Convention nor the Eurasian Patent Convention. This is the case for Andorra and Ukraine. Moldova, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina are extension states to the European Patent Convention, which means that European patents granted are deemed to take effect also in these states, if extension is correctly requested; and provided certain translation and publication requirements are met. = Utility models = In Europe, utility models are available in Austria (Gebrauchsmuster), France (\\"certificat d'utilit√©\\"), Germany (\\"Gebrauchsmuster\\"), Italy (\\"modello di utilit√†\\"), Finland (\\"hy√∂dyllisyysmalli\\"), Denmark (\\"brugsmodel\\"), Russia (\\"–ü–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–∞—è –º–æ–¥–µ–ª—å\\") and Spain (this list is however non-exhaustive). The term of a utility model is usually shorter than the term of a patent and has less stringent patentability requirements.  Differences and similarities between national laws  Substantive patent law has been harmonized to a certain extent across national laws in Europe, notably upon signature of the Strasbourg Convention of 1963 and the European Patent Convention (EPC) of 1973, and upon entry into force of the TRIPs Agreement. In practice however, the interpretation of common substantive provisions have led to different interpretations in different European countries. Regarding procedural law, and especially regarding the procedures to examine infringement and validity of patents before national courts, significant differences exist across national laws. For instance, while in Germany validity and infringement of patents are examined by different courts in different procedures (in a so-called \\"bifurcation system\\"), in the United Kingdom the same court is in charge of examining validity and infringement actions. According to Mr Justice Kitchin, a British judge, :\\"... it is desirable to try infringement and validity issues together, where at all possible. If they are tried separately it is all too easy for the patentee to argue for a narrow interpretation of his claim when defending it but an expansive interpretation when asserting infringement.\\"Mr Justice Kitchin, European Central Bank v Document Security Systems Inc. [2007] EWHC 600 (Pat) (26 March 2007), 88. In other words, the German bifurcation system is often regarded as favouring the patentee. In this respect, Lord Justice Jacob referred to a comparison reportedly made by Professor Mario Franzosi between a patentee and an Angora cat: :\\"When validity is challenged, the patentee says his patent is very small: the cat with its fur smoothed down, cuddly and sleepy. But when the patentee goes on the attack, the fur bristles, the cat is twice the size with teeth bared and eyes ablaze.\\"Lord Justice Jacob, European Central Bank v Document Security Systems Incorporated [2008] EWCA Civ 192 (19 March 2008), 5. The German patent system is, however, \\"particularly appealing for a large number of users\\", notably because it is regarded as relatively quick and affordable. The bifurcation character of the Germany system \\"is considered as both a shortcoming in some respects, and as an advantage in others.\\" Unitary patents in the European Union The creation of a European community patent system, which would lead to a single unitary patent in the European Union (or its predecessor the European Community), has been debated since the 1970s. In 2012 agreement was reached between all European Union Member States except Italy and Spain on a European patent with unitary effect, more commonly known as the unitary patent, a proposed new type of patent that would be valid in participating member states of the European Union. Unitary effect can be registered for a European patent upon grant, replacing validation of the European patent in the individual countries concerned. The unitary effect means a single renewal fee, a single (group of) owner(s), a single object of property, and uniform protection, which means that revocation as well as infringement proceedings are to be decided for the unitary patent as a whole rather than for each country individually. Licensing is however to remain possible for individual countries. Agreement on the two EU regulationsEU Regulations 1257/2012 and 1260/2012 which make the unitary patent possible was reached during the European Council of 28‚Äì29 June 2012, and by the European Parliament on 11 December 2012. The provisions will apply once the related Agreement on a Unified Patent Court, which was signed by all EU member states except Croatia, Poland and Spain, enters into force. However, Spain has introduced two actions for annulment,Case C-146/13 and Case C-147/13 against the two regulations, which were dismissed in May 2015 the EU Court of Justice. Other legal agreements have been proposed outside the European Union legal framework to reduce the cost of translation (of European patents when granted) and litigation, namely the London Agreement (which entered into force in 2008) and the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) (which never entered into force). Statistics Based on data from Germany, France, the Netherlands, and the UK, the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) found that German courts handle by far the largest number of patent litigation cases.

The first models were available on September 16, 2005. The System z9 also marks the end of the previously used eServer zSeries naming convention. It was also the last mainframe computer that NASA ever used.  Background  System z9 is a mainframe using the z/Architecture, previously known as ESAME. z/Architecture is a 64-bit architecture which replaces the previous 31-bit-addressing/32-bit-data ESA/390 architecture while remaining completely compatible with it as well as the older 24-bit- addressing/32-bit-data System/360 architecture. The primary advantage of this arrangement is that memory intensive applications like DB2 are no longer bounded by 31-bit memory restrictions while older applications can run without modifications. = Name change = With the announcement of the System z9 Business Class server, IBM has renamed the System z9 109 as the System z9 Enterprise Class server. IBM documentation abbreviates them as the z9 BC and z9 EC, respectively.  Notable differences  There are several functional enhancements in the System z9 compared to its zSeries predecessors. Some of the differences include: =Support Element & HMC = The Support Element is the most direct and lowest level way to access a mainframe. It circumvents even the Hardware Management Console and the operating system running on the mainframe. The HMC is a PC connected to the mainframe and emulates the Support Element. All preceding zSeries mainframes used a modified version of OS/2 with custom software to provide the interface. System z9's HMC no longer uses OS/2, but instead uses a modified version of Linux with an OS/2 lookalike interface to ease transition as well as a new interface. Unlike the previous HMC application on OS/2, the new HMC is web-based which means that even local access is done via a web browser. Remote HMC access is available, although only over an SSL encrypted HTTP connection. The web-based nature means that there is no longer a difference between local console access and remote access, which means a remote user potentially has full control if authorized, allowing more flexibility for locating systems within data centers. IBM refers to the new HMC as a \\"closed platform\\" which does not allow the user to install software or access the command line interface to increase security and stability. The HMC is also firewalled by default with a minimal number of open ports for remote access. = Program Directed Re-IPL = Program Directed Re- IPL is a new feature for Linux on System z9. It allows Linux systems running in an LPAR to re-IPL (reboot) themselves without operator intervention. This is accomplished by the System z9 storing the device and load parameters used to initially IPL the system. = DB2 and VSAM features = DB2, VSAM, and other data storage formats achieve greater I/O performance thanks to a new System z9 feature called a MIDAW. Also, the System z9 introduces the , a new type of processor that accelerates certain specific DB2 tasks. = Java features = Java 1.4 and higher support both 32-bit and 64-bit operation on z9. The System z9 also supports the zAAP processor, which allows most of the Java workload to be offloaded from the normal instruction processors. Java workloads executed by the zAAP processor do not count towards the IBM-rated capacity of the z9. This reduces the z9's total cost of ownership compared with other IBM platforms, as otherwise IBM would raise a customer's (software) license fees after installing an additional (hardware) processor. The zAAP also enables integration of new Java based Web applications with core z/OS backend database environment for high performance, reliability, availability, and security. = Cryptography = The System z9 adds 128-Bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to the list of hardware-based cryptographic algorithms. Other hardware-boosted features include additional random number generation and SHA algorithms. This specialized encryption hardware means System z9 potentially outperforms other platforms which must rely on encryption software. = LPARs = The System z9 supports up to 60 LPARs, up from the previous maximum of 30. = Larger memory capacity = The System z9 supports twice its immediate predecessors' maximum memory configurations: now up to 512 GB for the z9 EC and up to 64 GB for the z9 BC. = Concurrent system board replacement = The System z9 supports nondisruptive processor and memory replacement. That means a technician can replace an entire system board without ending any applications and without restarting any operating systems. In most configurations a System z9 can even manage this feat without any reduction in performance or capacity for the running applications. = 4 Gbit FICON and FCP = In May 2006, IBM added 4 Gigabit FICON and FCP support to the System z9 for faster I/O to storage devices. IBM also added a lower cost 2-port 4 Gbit FICON/FCP I/O adapter to the System z9 option list. = Smooth subcapacity increments = Also in May 2006, IBM introduced subcapacity settings to its high end model. For the first time mainframe processors now allow small, smooth steps through the entire processor range. This feature allows IBM's customers to control their software costs precisely and to pay for only exactly as much capacity as they need without harsh price discontinuities at certain capacity increments. (IBM started offering variable subcapacity software pricing in 2000, and some other software vendors now offer similar terms, so hardware subcapacity settings are of primary interest when running so-called full capacity software products.) = Group capacity limits = Available with z/OS Release 8, Group Capacity Limits allows an installation to define a group of LPARs within a single z9 or z10 machine whose capacity usage can be limited to a specific number of MSUs. Usage is based on the rolling 4 hour average CPU consumption, also in MSUs. A group need not necessarily be the same as an LPAR Cluster. LPARs can participate whether they are in a sysplex or not. = Separate processor pools = While previous mainframe generations (including the predecessor zSeries z990) supported specialty processors, such as zAAPs and ICFs, these were all managed by PR/SM out of the same processor pool (Pool 2). The IBM System z9 EC introduced the concept of separate pools for different types of specialty processor. This greatly eases the tasking of managing and measuring the performance of the different processor types. With z9 (and IBM System z10) the following pools are defined: *1 General-purpose processors *3 IFLs *4 zAAPs *5 ICFs *6 Pool 2 is no longer used. In addition to these 5 pools of characterized processors, there are three other categories of processor: *Service Assist Processors (for assisting with I/O operations) which all machines have. *Spare processors (to replace characterized processors in the event of a failure) which all machines have. *Unpurchased processors (which can be purchased and then characterized) which all but the most fully characterized machines have.  Models  = Enterprise Class = The System z9 Enterprise Class server, formerly known as the System z9 109, was the flagship of the System z9 series until the announcement of the IBM System z10. The most powerful model, the 2094-S54, achieves approximately twice the transactional performance of its most powerful predecessor, the zSeries z990 (2084-332). A single 2094-S54 machine provides up to 54 main processors (plus scores of secondary processors), at least two spare main processors, and up to 512 GB of main memory. Minimum memory is 16 GB. The System z9 EC is available in five hardware model configurations: * 2094-S08 * 2094-S18 * 2094-S28 * 2094-S38 * 2094-S54 = Business Class = On April 27, 2006, IBM announced the System z9 Business Class, also known as the z9 BC, as the successor to the zSeries z890 mainframe. IBM is positioning the z9 BC as a midrange system with a low cost of acquisition with up to twice the performance of the z890. The first z9 BCs began shipping on May 26, 2006. The z9 BC supports up to seven main processors (plus a dozen or more secondary processors). While the z9 BC can provide general purpose central processors (CPs), IBM is actively marketing the use of low cost specialty processors such as IFLs, zAAPs, and the new . (Every z9 BC can support at least three specialty engines even when maximally configured with CPs.) The z9 BC comes with a minimum of 8 GB of RAM and is expandable up to 64 GB. IBM offers kits that allow current z800 and z890 customers to upgrade to the z9 BC. A z9 BC customer can then upgrade to the z9 EC if extra capacity is required. The System z9 BC is available in two hardware model configurations: * 2096-R07 * 2096-S07 The seven System z9 hardware configurations support scores of software model configurations: 2094-401 through 2094-754 for the EC and 2096-A01 through 2096-Z04 for the BC (plus IFL-only models). = Pricing = The acquisition price for the System z9 ranges from \\"about $100,000\\" (IBM reported U.S. 2006 price, 2096-A01 model) to millions of dollars for the 2094-S54. (These prices are for new installations. Generally there are lower prices when upgrading from the immediate predecessor model, more like many software products and quite unlike most other hardware products.) For comparison, when new, the zSeries z890 had a starting price about twice that of the System z9 BC. = Successor machine = In February 2008, the IBM System z10 Enterprise Class was announced (and later in 2008 the z10 Business Class (BC) was announced). The z10 features quad-core technology, for up to 64 processors. The z10 has a number of power- saving, space-saving and throughput improvements compared to the z9.

Friedman is a progressive political activist, shuns intoxicants (straight edge), and follows a vegan diet. He lives in New York City. Biography As a pre-teen Friedman rode skateboards in the embanked schoolyards of West Los Angeles along with others that would revolutionize the activity. Whilst in junior high school, in the fall of 1976, Friedman corralled some of his friends, who were beginning to be featured in magazines, into riding in an empty swimming pool so he could make pictures. He showed the results to a freelance SkateBoarder writer, who put Friedman in touch with the editor. SkateBoarder published photographs by Friedman as a full-page subscription advertisement. He soon after became their youngest staff member. Several years later Friedman began to photograph at punk shows. Black Flag received some of their first media documentation through Friedman's work.Fuck You Heroes Introduction by C.R.

In 1985 Friedman was introduced to Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons, after creating some memorable Beastie Boys photos, before they were widely known. Friedman began working with them and their newly formed Def Jam Records, promoting Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Ice-T and Run-DMC. He also photographed many of their album covers and publicity materials, including the covers of Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, and Beastie Boys' Check Your Head,.

It plays in the Premier Division and has a reserve team in North Division One, as well as a Ladies team in the WCA National Division One and a Ladies reserve team in the WCA Development League. The club is based at Pairc nan Laoch, Portree.u Early history Skye had a strong tradition of playing shinty on the Old Celtic New Year, and there were a Portree Club and a Bernisdale Club in existence in the 1880s. However, Skye Camanachd in its present form came into being in 1892, winning the first ever MacTavish Cup. The club was a founding member of the Camanachd Association and entered the Camanachd Cup despite mainland clubs trying to force them to play on the mainland. The club had to wait almost 100 years to win the Camanachd Cup. The club endured a turbulent 1960s, and after a few years without entering competition was reformed in 1969. Re-establishment On 2 September 1969 the club was reconstituted with Colonel Jock MacDonald as president and Duncan MacIntyre, a shinty enthusiast and local police inspector at the time, as chairman, and immediately set about fund-raising for the forthcoming season. Instrumental in the re-establishment of the club was Donald R. MacDonald, known as \\"DR\\", who was a Scottish Gaelic teacher at Portree High School. The coaching of shinty which he started in the High School sowed the seeds of Skye's greatest success, the Camanachd Cup win of 1990. DR managed the first team in the early 2000s and his sons, Somhairle, Aonghas and Gilleasbuig, all went on to play for the club. Aonghas also managed the club between 2009 and 2010. DR died in March 2010 on the first day of that year's shinty season, and Skye's matches were cancelled that day. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Skye Camanachd won several Sutherland Cup finals and this was to build up to their greatest triumph, the Camanachd Cup in 1990. Camanachd Cup 1990 Skye won the Camanachd Cup for the first time in 1990 against Newtonmore in Fort William. Inspirational in this victory was player Willie Cowie and his brother, manager Ross Cowie. The BBC programme \\"Home\\", directed by Douglas Mackinnon, filmed behind the scenes on the day as well as the triumphant homecoming to Portree where they were met by a crowd of 5000 people, almost half the island's population. The expensive trophy was lost and then found in the street at 6 a.m. the next day: the local legend was that everybody thought that someone else was looking after it. In addition to winning the Cup, the Albert Smith Medal, an award presented to the Man of the Match in the final of the Camanachd Cup every year since 1972, was presented to Willie Macrae from Skye Camanachd in 1990. Skye remains the only team from an island to have won the Cup. The club toured Nova Scotia in 1991 in the afterglow of the success alongside Kingussie. Recent times Portree Camanachd Ground and Clubhouse - geograph.org.uk - 266456 Skye have never again won the Camanachd Cup, but they achieved Premier Division status in the early 2000s under the management of Angus Murchison before being relegated. The club has shown a flair for another sort of promotion however, securing lucrative sponsorship deals with Danish firms Carlsberg and Hummel. The club also benefited in early 2008 from an anonymous loan of ¬£50,000 from a local individual, with repayments based on future success. Much of this went to pay off some of the loan which had been invested in the development of the Pairc nan Laoch stadium after the move from the council-owned King George V Park. In July 2008, the first team won the Balliemore Cup for the first time, defeating Kilmallie 3‚Äì1 at Braeview Park, Beauly. Gilleasbuig Macdonald was the captain. The club reappointed Angus Murchison to succeed Alasdair Morrison as manager in 2009. Aonghas MacDonald became manager halfway through the season and steered Skye to 3rd place, impressing enough to be given the full-time position in 2010. Ross Cowie, now Chairman of the club, demanded an improvement from the club's reserve side in 2010, after two poor seasons which had seen the reserve team, although historically successful, finish in the bottom half of the North Division Two and suffer humiliating defeats to lower league opposition. In June 2009, Skye won the Plate competition of the Marine Harvest Clash of the Camans at An Aird, defeating Lochside Rovers and Fort William 2nds. The club also undertook the first ever tour of the United States by a Scottish shinty club, visiting California in September 2009. The club had an underwhelming 2010 season. Aonghas MacDonald stepped down at the end of the season, but was reappointed to the role for the 2011 season before stepping down again at the end of the year. Davie MacVicar also stepped down as reserve manager at the end of the season, to be replaced by Murdo Morrison. Willie MacRae was appointed as the eleventh manager of Skye Camanachd in early 2012. He had a successful season at the wheel, with the club's young squad reaching second in the league. MacRae was at the helm for a disappointing season in 2013 which saw Skye miss out on the new National Division One. John 'Spod' MacLeod was appointed to the manager's role in 2014. In July 2014, the club won the Balliemore Cup again with a hard-earned victory over Ballachulish at Taynuilt. Having twice led with goals from Johnathan ‚ÄúShockie‚Äù MacLennan and Danny Morrison, the latter in extra-time, it took a Jordan Murchison goal three minutes from the end of extra time to secure the cup 3‚Äì2 for Skye. As in the 2008 triumph, Skye were captained by Gilleasbuig MacDonald. The club also won the Marine Harvest North Division 1 title in 2014 undefeated. Skye Camanachd win North Division One in 2014 In 2015 Skye again went undefeated and this was more than enough to see them return to the Premier Division after winning National Division One. Skye Camanachd Ladies The club started a ladies' shinty team in 2011. Previously, players such as Sarah Corrigall would play for Glengarry, but now the opportunity for players in Skye and Lochalsh would be available. The club entered North Division Two in 2011 with Lorna MacRae winning the division's player of the year award. The team finished 3rd in 2012. They were also successful in securing the right to play home games on a Saturday. (Sunday play deemed to not be possible due to local religious sensibilities). The team won the North Division Two in 2013 with Skye's Helen Lamond winning the league's Player of the Year award jointly with Hazel Hunter of Strathglass. The Ladies then proceeded to be runners up in both the WCA National Division One and Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup in 2014. Sarah Corrigall was named player of the match in the cup final despite Skye going down 3-2 to Glasgow Mid Argyll. Player/manager Corrigall started the match in goals and finished in midfield. Caitlin MacLean and Lorna MacRae were the goal scorers for the Skye team captained by Rosalind Lamond. In 2015, they finished third in the league and reached the semi-final of the Camanachd Cup. Whilst a very young club, Skye has already provided a significant number of internationalists. Skye Camanachd Ladies enjoyed a successful 2016 season under manager Robbie Gordon and clinched their first Marine Harvest National Division One title with a 0-9 victory over Aberdour at Silversands in Fife. The new champions of Scotland have also qualified for the final of the Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup in Fort William but were beaten 4-2 by Lochaber Ladies. Skye Camanachd Ladies also currently sit third in the new Women's Camanachd Association Development League with what it essentially their reserve team. The Ladies lifted the Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup for the first time in 2017 and retained their National Division One title too. The Cup was lifted after a stunning 6-1 demolition of Lochaber Ladies avenging the disappointment of the previous years defeat against the same team. In 2018, a Third team was added playing in the Development League while the second team competed for the first time in WCA North Division Two. The Second team's first match was a 10-0 away defeat to Strathglass, but the young team bounced back in their next game beating Inverness 8-1 at Pairc nan Laoch, Portree. The First team currently lead the National Division One and will again play in the final of the Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup. Skye Camanachd Youth The Skye Camanachd U17 team of 2011 won the Co-operative MacTavish Juvenile Cup after an emphatic 4-0 victory over Lochaber in a very wet Inverness. Jordan Murchison opened the scoring. In 2015 the Skye Camanachd U17 team lost the RBS MacTavish Juvenile Cup Final 2-0 to Beauly. Skye Camanachd U17 won the 2016 RBS MacTavish Juvenile Cup at the Bught Park, Inverness on Saturday 11 June 2016 beating Fort William 2-1. Coached by Davie Pringle the goals came from captain James Pringle and Ross Gordon. Skye full centre John Gillies was awarded the Sandy MacKay Medal as man of the match, becoming the third Skye player to win the honour. The other previous Skye winners of the Sandy MacKay Medal were Ryan Morrison (2015) and Jordan Murchison (2011).

It is located on the right bank of the Don River approximately upstream from the major Russian port city of Rostov-on-Don. It is famous for having been the center of Don Cossack culture and politics for nearly two centuries as the capital of the Don Host Oblast. Due to regular spring floods that submerged the small city on several occasions, the Cossacks moved their capital to higher ground at Novocherkassk in 1805. In and around Starocherkasskaya there are over forty noteworthy historical and cultural sites including the Resurrection (Voskresensky) Cathedral, completed in 1719, and its famous gilded wooden iconostasis. History A Cossack fortress on the island of what was later called Monastyrsky on the Don river was probably built before 1570 although it is first mentioned in chronicles from 1593. After fifty years it became the capital of the Don Cossacks, first as an independent entity in between Russia, Turkey and Poland, then a vassal of the Russian tzars, then as an administrative region, then as the Don Voisko Province of the Russian Empire. Looking toward the Transfiguration (Preobrazhensky) Cathedral In its heyday in the 18th century, Cherkassk was a busy city with a strong fortress. The city was the major residence of quite a few famous Don cossacks of the 17th and 18th centuries, including Stepan Razin, Yermak Timofeyevich, Kondraty Bulavin and Matvei Platov. It was also the location of fierce battles between Russian, Ottoman, Crimean and Cossack forces. Being on an island, the city's position was very convenient for a fortress and military camp, but inconvenient for an administrative and trade center ‚Äî in spring the island was flooded by Don river and the crowded wooden city was subject to devastating fires. In 1805, the Don Voisko Province's ataman, Matvei Platov moved the capital to the newly and specially built city of Novocherkassk (literally New-Cherkassk), which was on a hill, about 40 kilometres from Cherkassk. Most of the residents of Cherkassk moved to the new capital. The remnants of the old city got the name of the stanitsa (village) of Starocherkasskaya (literally Old-Cherkassk). Now it is a site of an important museum, tourist center and orthodox male convent. Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov was a major contributor to the museum's organization.

He is noted for fighting a duel with future U.S. president Andrew Jackson in 1788. Family Avery married Leah Probart Francks (d. 13 January 1832) on 3 October 1778 in New Bern, North Carolina. A grandson, Isaac E. Avery, served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, perishing at the Battle of Gettysburg. Another grandson was William Waightstill Avery, speaker of the North Carolina Senate and a member of the Confederate Congress. Career Avery enrolled at Yale in 1763. After two years, unhappy with the oppressive discipline of the college's unpopular president, Thomas Clapp, he and his friend Oliver Ellsworth transferred to the College of New Jersey (today's Princeton University). Ellsworth would go on to become a congressman, a framer of the Constitution, and a Justice of the Supreme Court; the two remained fast friends, even after Avery moved to North Carolina following graduation. Avery quickly became a successful attorney in the Piedmont region of the state. He took a leading role, along with other Princeton graduates like Joseph Alexander, Hezekiah Balch, and David Caldwell, in the unsuccessful attempt to win a Royal charter for what would have been North Carlina's first college, in 1771. Queen's College, in Charlotte, was incorporated by the colonial legislature but disallowed by King George III. It continued for several years as a preparatory school, with a library donated by Avery. Avery was elected to the colonial assembly in 1772 and served as attorney-general for the Crown. In 1775 and 1776, Avery was elected to the North Carolina Provincial Congresses and in that capacity helped draft the first Constitution of North Carolina in 1776. He was the first Attorney General of North Carolina (1777‚Äì1779) and a colonel in the state's militia during the American Revolutionary War; he also served in the North Carolina General Assembly (the House of Commons in 1782, 1783, 1784, 1785, 1793, and the Senate in 1796). He was among the early instigators clamoring for the colony's independence from Great Britain. His service record in the American Revolution includes: * Colonel over the Jones County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1779-1780) * Captain in the Burke County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1781) According to the Dictionary of North Carolina Biography (ed. Powell, Vol I. p. 70) \\"In 1780, while occupying Charlotte, Cornwallis ordered the burning of Avery's office; of his books and papers, only those stored at the home of his friend Hezekiah Alexander were saved. This evidence of displeasure was visited only upon those whom Cornwallis considered leading offenders.\\" Duel with Andrew Jackson In 1788, Avery was challenged to a duel by Andrew Jackson, then a young lawyer in the western territory that would become Tennessee. According to legend, Avery, already one of the state's most prominent lawyers by then, would often proclaim \\"I refer to Bacon\\"--meaning The Elements of the Common Laws of England, the noted legal text written by Francis Bacon--when making a point. One day, it is said that Jackson surreptitiously replaced the volume with an actual side of bacon in Avery's saddlebags. Embarrassed when Avery scolded him for levity in the courtroom, \\"Old Hickory\\" is supposed to have issued the challenge. Whatever the actual cause, the duel took place. The two men met on the field of honor, each intentionally missed the other while firing, and they left fast friends.Robert V. Remini, Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Empire (New York: Harper and Row, 1976) 38-39. Honoraria Avery County, North Carolina was named for him, as is the Waightstill Avery Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Brevard, North Carolina. The Swan Ponds plantation home built by his son Isaac Thomas Avery in 1848, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Biography = The ‚ÄûOld Bikini‚Äù period = The band was formed in 1982 by singer Fer√≥ Nagy and guitarist J√≥zsef Vedres after the disband of Beatrice. Bassist Alajos N√©meth, his brother, drummer G√°bor N√©meth and guitarist G√°bor Sz≈±cs Antal joined them and formed Bikini. In the first years Bikini played punk music very similar to Beatrice. Frontman and songwriter Fer√≥ Nagy saw the band as a Beatrice-afterband, even covering some of their old songs. Most of their fans were the same as of Beatrice, going to concert not because of the band but because of the \\"Fer√≥ Nagy phenomenon\\". This formation released two albums \\"Hova lett...\\" in 1983 and \\"XX. sz√°zadi h√≠rad√≥\\" in 1984 (without G√°bor Sz≈±cs Antal). Despite all similarities, Bikini and Rice were quite different, at least, seeing them retrospectively. The ‚ÄûOld‚Äù Bikini members decided to strengthen the funny, rebel, ‚Äûidiotic‚Äù side of Beatrice and the new band played a much more alternative and extraordinary, dadaistic hard rock-like or new wave music with simple, nonsense lyrics, sometimes went into clear huey, assembled from interjection expressions, child poetry, (Otyi-Totyi Ping-pong, Ki csin√°l sz√≥d√°t?), blurred distopic visions about human mind control by engineering/education (Program), or parodistic dance music quotes (Nem leszek) . = The L. D. Nagy period = In 1985 Fer√≥ Nagy left the band (from 1999 the line-up with Fer√≥ Nagy sometimes has reunion-concerts as \\"≈ês-Bikini\\" - \\"Old Bikini\\"). Singer Lajos D. Nagy came in his place, along with keyboardist P√©ter Gallai. This caused a great change in Bikini's style and image. During the late 1980s the band became a professional and talented team mostly playing popular, ‚Äûsynths- and winds-backed‚Äù pop rock and hard rock music. Along with some lineup changes during the years (most notably Bertalan Hirlemann as drummer and Zsolt Daczi as guitarist) Bikini released several albums and made several successful tours. They finally achieved stardom in 1988 with the album \\"Ha volna m√©g id≈ëm...\\". Despite his left-out, Fer√≥ was in good relations with the band, and as lyricist, wrote some of their biggest hits (Ezt nem tudom m√°sk√©pp mondani, ', Fagyi, Meg√ºssem vagy ne √ºssem, Neh√©z a dolga a katon√°nak). The band continued to release successful albums in the early 1990s. In 1992 at the peak of their career, they disbanded. They were reunited in 1997 after a five year absence from the music world. Along with various lineup changes during the late 1990s, the band continued to release successful albums and tour extensively. Their last original album: \\"≈êrz√∂m a l√°ngot\\" was released in 2007. In 2009, they released a best-of double album, with all of their greatest hits re-recorded with the current line-up. Currently, they're preparing for the next album - besides touring extensively in Hungary and the Hungarian-populated regions in the neighboring countries.

It is dedicated to the Roman martyr Saint Pancras, and is believed by many to be one of the oldest sites of Christian worship in England. The church is situated on Pancras Road in the London Borough of Camden, with the surrounding area and its international railway station taking its name. St Pancras Old Church, which was largely rebuilt in the Victorian era, should not be confused with St Pancras New Church (1819‚Äì1822) about away, on Euston Road. History St Pancras Old Church in 1815. It was largely reconstructed later in the 19th century. The River Fleet has been covered over. =Parish= Originally, the parish of St Pancras stretched from close to Oxford Street almost to Highgate. In the early Middle Ages there was a centre of population in the vicinity of what is now known as the old church. However, in the 14th century the population abandoned the site and moved to what is now Kentish Town. The reasons for this were probably the vulnerability of the plain around the church to flooding (the River Fleet, which is now underground, runs through it) and the availability of better wells at Kentish Town, where there is less clay in the soil. The church subsequently fell into disrepair. Towards the end of the 18th century, services were only held in the church on one Sunday each month; on other weeks, the same congregation would use a chapel in Kentish Town. 18th and early 19th century urban expansion led to the construction of the capacious St Pancras New Church on what was then the \\"New Road\\" (Euston Road, about a km away). The old building lost its status as the parish church when the New Church was consecrated in 1822, and became a chapel of ease. =Early history= Evidence for the early history of the church is scanty. It is considered by some to have existed since AD 314, although there is no archaeological or documentary evidence to support this. The claim is discussed below under Legendary origins. An anonymous pen and ink sketch of the South-East view, circa 1840 Phil Emery and Pat Miller discuss the issue in 'Archaeological findings at the site of the St Pancras Burial Ground and its vicinity'. > The 1847 reconstruction of the medieval church revealed Roman tiles in the > fabric of its tower and an inscribed altar stone dated to AD 625, which > might suggest an early 7th-century foundation. The original cemetery around > the church appears to have been sub-circular like many late Saxon > cemeteries. Remnants of medieval features and references in the Domesday Book suggest it pre-dates the Norman Conquest. According to a Victorian architect, Robert Lewis Roumieu, involved in the works: > The old church was principally late Tudor. When it was pulled down to be > rebuilt, several small Norman columns, pilaster piers and other remains of a > Norman edifice were found among the materials used in the wall, leaving no > doubt but that the original church had been a Norman structure which had > been at some time completely rebuilt and part used as building material in > the reconstruction. After the Reformation the isolation and decay of the church made it a tempting resort for Catholics: indeed, it was said that the last bell which tolled for the Mass in England was at St Pancras. St Pancras (and to a lesser degree Paddington Church) were the only places in London where Roman Catholics were permitted to be buried Among the several Catholics buried in the churchyard was Johann Christian Bach, youngest son of Johann Sebastian. His name was misspelled in the burial register as John Cristian Back. =Restoration= Interior view of the chancel. Interior looking west. As it stood in the early 19th century, the church consisted of an unaisled nave, a chancel without a chancel arch and a western tower. The south porch had served as a vestry since the 18th century. By 1847 the Old Church was derelict, but in view of the growth of population in the southern part of the parish, it was decided to restore it. (Victorian restoration of churches is not what we understand today by the phrase building restoration.) The architect of the alterations was Alexander Dick Gough. The old tower was removed, allowing the nave to be extended westwards, and a new tower was built on the south side. The south porch was removed, and a new vestry was added on the north side. The whole exterior of the church was refaced or reworked. The enlargement and the addition of galleries increased the capacity of the church from about 120 to 500. There were further restorations in 1888 by Arthur Blomfield with the reredos by C E Buckeridge; in 1925 when the plaster ceiling and the side galleries were removed, and in 1948 following Second World War bomb damage. The building was designated a grade II* listed building on 10 June 1954. =Present organisation= The church has a chaplaincy to the nearby St Pancras Hospital and since 1 June 2003 has formed part of the Old St Pancras Team Ministry (which also includes St Michael's Church, Camden Town, St Mary's Church, Somers Town and St Paul's Church, Camden Square). On 11 December 2007 it marked the opening of the nearby St Pancras International station with a bilingual service and a twinning with the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris, near the Gare du Nord, Paris. In 2013 an official appeals project was launched to raise the funds necessary to preserve the church and grounds. As a traditional Catholic church that rejects the ordination of women as priests and bishops, it receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker). Legendary origins As early as 1593 the cartographer John Norden had commented in his Speculum Britanniae that the dilapidated St Pancras church looked older than St Paul's Cathedral. By the 18th century there seems to have been a local belief that St Pancras was of very great age, perhaps the oldest church in England. The contemporary London historian William Maitland dismissed this as a \\"vulgar Tradition\\", and suggested that there was confusion with the ancient church with the same dedication in the grounds of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, which was said to have been converted from a pagan temple by St Augustine of Canterbury in 598. In 1870 local historian Samuel Palmer reported \\"This old and venerable church is said to be the first Christian place of worship in the county of Middlesex in the eighth or ninth century.\\" Later attempts to prove an early date for the foundation of the church include the claim by J. Carter Rendell (vicar 1912‚Äì26) that a medieval altar slab marked with five consecration crosses, found during the 19th-century building works, could be dated to the 6th century. An earlier vicar is said to have claimed to have seen in the Vatican Library a manuscript mentioning that St Pancras church was built in the 9th century, and another to have seen a similar document placing the foundation in the 4th century. Information panels outside the church today state that it \\"stands on one of Europe‚Äôs most ancient sites of Christian worship, possibly dating back to the early 4th century\\" and has been a \\"site of prayer and meditation since 314 AD\\". The case for these claims seems first to have been argued by local historian Charles Lee in 1955, who wrote: > There can be little doubt that a Roman encampment was situated opposite the > site of St Pancras Church about this period, and that the church is on the > site of a Roman Compitum, which served as a centre of public worship and > public meeting... It seems probable that the Roman Compitum at St Pancras > was adapted to Christian worship shortly after the restoration of religious > freedom in 313 (taking its name from the recently-martyred Pancras). Lee's \\"Roman encampment\\" was \\"Caesar‚Äôs Camp at Pancras called the Brill\\", identified by the antiquary William Stukeley in the 1750s.Stukeley's original plan of Caesar's Camp in the British Library However, even Stukeley's contemporaries could see no trace of this camp, and considered that Stukeley had let his imagination run away with him. Gillian Tindall has suggested that the lumps and bumps in the fields to the west of the church that Stukeley interpreted as a Roman camp were actually traces of the original medieval village of St. Pancras, before the centre of the settlement moved north to the area now known as Kentish Town. Lee's use of the word compitum, properly a Roman temple or shrine situated at a crossroads, indicates his indebtedness to the work of Montagu Sharpe (1856‚Äì1942), a Middlesex magistrate, former chairman of the Middlesex County Council and amateur historian and archaeologist. Sharpe had proposed, in a book first published in 1919, that the area of the county of Middlesex had in Roman times been subject to the form of land division known as centuriation, marked out by roads in a regular grid pattern covering the whole county. Sharpe noted, when plotting his gridlines, that a number of ancient parish churches appeared to be on or close to intersections, or at least on road alignments. He concluded that these churches must therefore stand on the sites of pagan compita, and represent the deliberate conversion of pagan temples to Christian use by early missionaries to the Middle Saxons in the 7th century. And St Pancras Old Church is one of those marked on Sharpe's map. The above makes it clear that there is no reliable evidence for an early date for St Pancras, and that the claims are all based on unsupported speculation, with no archaeological or documentary evidence to back the speculation up. Internal monuments Samuel Cooper's grave, Old St Pancras Church, London The church contains the grave of Samuel Cooper (or Cowper), the miniaturist, against its east wall. Churchyard Tomb of John Soane The churchyard, which is the largest green space in the locality, is managed by the London Borough of Camden. It has some fine mature trees, and was restored in the first few years of the 21st century. The graveyard served not only as a burial place for the parishioners but also for Roman Catholics from all around London. They included many French refugees (√©migr√©s), especially priests, who had fled the Revolution, one of them the spy Chevalier d'√âon. Notable people buried in the churchyard include the notorious colonial administrator Joseph Wall who was executed for cruelty in 1802, vampire writer and physician John Polidori, the composers Carl Friedrich Abel and Johann Christian Bach, the eighteenth son of Johann Sebastian Bach, and the sculptor John Flaxman. William Franklin, the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin, and last colonial Governor of New Jersey was interred here in 1814. There is a spousal memorial tomb for philosophers and writers Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, though their remains are now in Bournemouth. In 2009, commemorations of the 250th anniversary of Wollstonecraft's birth were held by various groups, both inside the church and at the gravestone. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many foreign dignitaries and aristocrats were buried in the graveyard; they are commemorated on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial Sundial, an elaborate memorial commissioned by the philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts. The architect John Soane designed a tomb for his wife and himself in the churchyard, which is now Grade I listed. This mausoleum provided the inspiration for the design by Giles Gilbert Scott of the iconic red telephone boxes. Great Tree of London, growing between gravestones moved while Thomas Hardy was working here The Burdett Coutts Memorial to Lost Graves in Old St Pancras Churchyard The grave of Abraham Woodhead, Old St Pancras Churchyard, London Other people associated with the churchyard include the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and the future Mary Shelley, who planned their 1814 elopement over meetings at the grave of her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, mentioned above. Charles Dickens mentions it by name in his 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities, making it the location of body snatching to provide corpses for dissection at medical schools, a common practice at the time. Burials in the churchyard eventually ceased under the Extramural Interment Act in 1854, and St Pancras and Islington Cemetery was opened in East Finchley. In the mid-1860s, the young Thomas Hardy, was in charge of the excavation of part of the graveyard, in the course of the construction of the Midland Railway's London terminus. More burials were removed in 2002. The stone installation by Emily Young and Jeremy Clarke The churchyard was reopened in June 1877 as St Pancras Gardens, following the movement to allow conversion of disused burial grounds into public gardens. Angela Burdett-Coutts, an important local benefactress, laid the foundation stone of the memorial sundial she had presented. A recent addition is a polished marble stone at the entrance to the church, a collaboration between and a gift from the poet Jeremy Clarke and the sculptor Emily Young. It is inscribed: \\"And I am here / in a place / beyond desire or fear\\", an extract from the long poem \\"Praise\\" by Clarke. =Names of note listed on the Burdett Coutts Memorial as lost= This impressive monument was erected in 1877 when the northern half of the churchyard was formalised as a public park, clearing most of the smaller gravestones.

A memorial bench bears a plaque commemorating the group's \\"Mad Day Out\\". The video for Lene Lovich's 1979 hit \\"Bird Song\\" was filmed in the church and churchyard. In 2013, British R&B; singer Sam Smith performed two concerts at the church. The live version of \\"I've Told You Now\\" was included on deluxe editions of their album In the Lonely Hour. On 24 September 2014, singer Claudia Br√ºcken, best known for her work with German electronic group Propaganda, performed a solo show at the church.

Owned by Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd (who use its official name of Chelsea River Bridge) it connects to the extreme north-east part of Fulham, known as Chelsea Harbour or Imperial Wharf, a 21st-century- rebuilt area on the south side of a Chelsea Creek. The bridge is used by the West London Line of the London Overground from Clapham Junction to Willesden Junction. History alt=View from a barge of long arch above and barge passing beside, side of arches also visible with diamond-shaped painted balustrades. Backdrop of mid-storey buildings behind a tree-lined promenade. The bridge was designed by William Baker, chief engineer of the London and North Western Railway, and was opened on 2 March 1863 at a cost of ¬£87,000 (). It carries two tracks and consists of five lattice girder arches set on stone piers. A three-arch brick viaduct carries the line on the north side of the bridge, with one arch having been opened to provide a pedestrian route under the railway, as part of the Thames Path. On the south side are four arches, two of which are used as storage for the residents of a houseboat community moored immediately downstream, and another one of which was opened to Thames Path pedestrian traffic as part of the Lombard Wharf development. The bridge was strengthened and refurbished in 1969, and again in 1992. During a high tide in late 2003, the structure was struck by a refuse-barge damaging some lower structural elements significantly: repairs were completed in early 2004. In November 2013, planning permission was granted for the Diamond Jubilee Footbridge, extending the two central piers of the bridge upstream. Trains crossing are subject to a 20/30 mph speed limit (locomotive-hauled traffic is restricted to 20 mph, all other traffic is limited to 30 mph). The bridge was declared a Grade II* listed structure in 2008, providing protection to preserve its special character from unsympathetic development.

The miner represents the chief industry of the state at the time of statehood. Inside, the shield bears images symbolic of the state. The pine tree in the foreground refers to Idaho's immense timber interests. The husbandman plowing on the left side of the shield, together with the sheaf of grain beneath the shield, are emblematic of Idaho's agricultural resources, while the two cornucopias, or horns of plenty, refer to the horticultural. Idaho has a game law, which protects the elk and moose, and an elk's head rises above the shield. The state flower, the wild syringa or mock orange, grows at the woman's feet, while the ripened wheat grows as high as her shoulder. The river depicted in the shield is the Snake or Shoshone River.

In French, such a stew of a game animal thickened with the animal's blood is known as a civet. Jugged hare One common traditional dish that involves jugging is jugged hare (known as civet de li√®vre in France), which is a whole hare, cut into pieces, marinated and cooked with red wine and juniper berries in a tall jug that stands in a pan of water. It is traditionally served with the hare's blood (or the blood is added right at the very end of the cooking process) and port wine. John Doyle attributed \\"First catch your hare\\" to Mrs. Glasse Jugged Hare is described in the influential 18th-century cookbook, The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse, with a recipe titled, \\"A Jugged Hare,\\" that begins, \\"Cut it into little pieces, lard them here and there....\\" The recipe goes on to describe cooking the pieces of hare in water in a jug that is set within a bath of boiling water to cook for three hours.Glasse, Hannah. The Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy. London, 1747. page 50 Beginning in the nineteenth century, Glasse has been widely credited with having started the recipe with the words \\"First, catch your hare\\". This attribution is apocryphal. Her actual directions are, \\"Take your Hare when it is cas'd, and make a pudding...\\" To 'case' means to take off the skin [not \\"to catch\\"]. Both the Oxford English Dictionary and The Dictionary of National Biography discuss the attribution. However, having a freshly caught, or shot, hare enables one to obtain its blood. A freshly killed hare is prepared for jugging by removing its entrails and then hanging it in a larder by its hind legs, which causes the blood to accumulate in the chest cavity. One method of preserving the blood after draining it from the hare (since the hare itself is usually hung for a week or more) is to mix it with red wine vinegar in order to prevent it coagulating, and then to store it in a freezer. Many other British cookbooks from before the middle of the 20th century have recipes for Jugged Hare. Merle and Reitch have this to say about Jugged Hare, for example: > The best part of the hare, when roasted, is the loin and the thick part of > the hind leg; the other parts are only fit for stewing, hashing, or jugging. > It is usual to roast a hare first, and to stew or jug the portion which is > not eaten the first day. [...] To Jug A Hare. This mode of cooking a hare is > very desirable when there is any doubt as to its age, as an old hare, which > would be otherwise uneatable, may be made into an agreeable dish. [...] In 2006, a survey of 2021 people for the television channel UKTV Food found that only 1.6% of the people aged under 25 recognized Jugged Hare by name. 7 out of 10 of those people stated that they would refuse to eat Jugged Hare if it were served at the house of a friend or a relative. Jugged rabbit Jugged rabbit (civet de lapin) is an alternative to Jugged Hare. It is considered a speciality of the cuisine of Martinique. Jugged kippers Another jugged dish, also traditional in the United Kingdom, is jugged kippers, which is kippers (with the heads and tails removed) in a covered jug, cooked in boiling water. Recipe books recommend jugging kippers as one way of avoiding the strong smell that kippers have.

The co- originators of MASCOT were Hugo Simpson and Ken Jackson (currently with Telelogic). Where most methodologies tend to concentrate on bringing rigour and structure to a software project's functional aspects, MASCOT's primary purpose is to emphasise the architectural aspects of a project. Its creators purposely avoided saying anything about the functionality of the software being developed, and concentrated on the real-time control and interface definitions between concurrently running processes. MASCOT was successfully used in a number of defence systems, most notably the Rapier ground-to-air missile system of the British Army. Although still in use on systems in the field, it never reached critical success and has been subsequently overshadowed by object oriented design methodologies based on UML. A British Standards Institution (BSI) standard was drafted for version 3 of the methodology, but was never ratified. Copies of the draft standard can be still obtained from the BSI. MASCOT in the field The UK Ministry of Defence has been the primary user of the MASCOT method through its application in significant military systems, and at one stage mandated its use for new operational systems. Examples include the Rapier missile system, and various Royal Navy Command & Control Systems. The Future of the Method MASCOT's principles continue to evolve in the academic community (principally at the DCSC) and the aerospace industry Matra BAe Dynamics, through research into temporal aspects of software design and the expression of system architectures, most notably in the DORIS (Data-Oriented Requirements Implementation Scheme) method and implementation protocols. Work has also included combining UML and DORIS to provide a richer means of describing complex real-time systems (Computer Science Research Institute).

Born as the first of seven children, Thorpe initially worked in the local shipyards. However, in 1977, following encouragement of a friend he successfully applied to study art at Cleveland College of Art and Design, where he flourished under the tuition of Tom Wall, going on to study for a Fine Art BA at Byam Shaw College of Art in London from which he graduated in 1982. In 1989 he decided to become a full-time artist, moving from London to Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he opened the Mackenzie Thorpe Arthaus gallery. In 2000 he was awarded an honorary degree of Master of Arts from Teesside University, followed by being was awarded an honorary professorship by Seisa University in Japan in 2019.. His works are associated with a principle of \\"Art from the heart\\" ‚Äì combining tenderness with fervency through his abstract depictions of animals and children. His work is wide- ranging from the accessible 'square sheep' and duffle coat boys to more challenging work focusing on isolation and man's struggle. Much of his work depicts his childhood growing up in Middlesbrough. His auction record of ¬£9,000, paid for his 91 cm square oil on canvas \\"The Family (Kiss)\\" was set at Tennant's auction house in Leyburn on 4 March 2009. He and his staff operate through a company, and in 2020 his original artworks were said to cost from ¬£10,000.

She was married to Brazilian comedian Chico Anysio, with whom she has two children, Rodrigo and Victoria. The couple divorced in 1998. Z√©lia Cardoso de Mello worked in the academic, public and private sectors in Brazil. She graduated from FEA-USP where she also got her PhD degree in Economics. She was a professor at the University of S√£o Paulo for almost 20 years Her political career began in 1986 when Dilson Funaro, the Minister of Finance of Brazil, invited her to join his Economic Advisory Team as Director of the National Treasure Dept. In 1990 Cardoso de Mello was appointed the National Minister of Economy, Finance and Planning of Brazil under president Fernando Collor de Mello. After significant criticism, she resigned this position in May 1991. In 1991, she released a biography, \\"Zelia, A Passion\\". It became a best-seller, perhaps because, according to a review, \\"It says little about tax reform and inflation, but a lot about Cardoso's sexual exploits in office.\\" In 1995 she moved to New York City and became a visiting scholar at the Institute of Latin America and Iberian Studies at Columbia University. Since 1998, Cardoso de Mello has served executive positions at several major financial advisory companies focused on Brazil, including Global Access Investments, Orix and Lily Pond Capital. Her academic career was entirely accomplished in the School of Business and Economics at the University of S√£o Paulo, where she received her college degree, Doctorate, and served as university professor.

The final draft was probably strongly influenced by a document discussed by the advisors of PMDB party candidate Ulysses Guimar√£es, and later by advisors of PT party candidate Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva, during the period between the general election and the runoff. In spite of the differences in their general economic strategies, these competing candidates failed to develop their own stabilization policies at a time of rapid price increases and risk of hyperinflation during the second half of 1989.

There may be a number of different goals sought, for example‚Äîto determine the optimal state estimate of a system, to determine initial conditions for a numerical forecast model, to interpolate sparse observation data using (e.g. physical) knowledge of the system being observed, to train numerical model parameters based on observed data. Depending on the goal, different solution methods may be used. Data assimilation is distinguished from other forms of machine learning, image analysis, and statistical methods in that it utilizes a dynamical model of the system being analyzed. Data assimilation initially developed in the field of numerical weather prediction. Numerical weather prediction models are equations describing the dynamical behavior of the atmosphere, typically coded into a computer program. In order to use these models to make forecasts, initial conditions are needed for the model that closely resemble the current state of the atmosphere. Simply inserting point- wise measurements into the numerical models did not provide a satisfactory solution. Real world measurements contain errors both due to the quality of the instrument and how accurately the position of the measurement is known. These errors can cause instabilities in the models that eliminate any level of skill in a forecast. Thus, more sophisticated methods were needed in order to initialize a model using all available data while making sure to maintain stability in the numerical model. Such data typically includes the measurements as well as a previous forecast valid at the same time the measurements are made. If applied iteratively, this process begins to accumulate information from past observations into all subsequent forecasts. Because data assimilation developed out of the field of numerical weather prediction, it initially gained popularity amongst the geosciences. In fact, one of the most cited publication in all of the geosciences is an application of data assimilation to reconstruct the observed history of the atmosphere. Details of the data assimilation process Classically, data assimilation has been applied to chaotic dynamical systems that are too difficult to predict using simple extrapolation methods. The cause of this difficulty is that small changes in initial conditions can lead to large changes in prediction accuracy. This is sometimes known as the butterfly effect ‚Äì the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. At any update time, data assimilation usually takes a forecast (also known as the first guess, or background information) and applies a correction to the forecast based on a set of observed data and estimated errors that are present in both the observations and the forecast itself. The difference between the forecast and the observations at that time is called the departure or the innovation (as it provides new information to the data assimilation process). A weighting factor is applied to the innovation to determine how much of a correction should be made to the forecast based on the new information from the observations. The best estimate of the state of the system based on the correction to the forecast determined by a weighting factor times the innovation is called the analysis. In one dimension, computing the analysis could be as simple as forming a weighted average of a forecasted and observed value. In multiple dimensions the problem becomes more difficult. Much of the work in data assimilation is focused on adequately estimating the appropriate weighting factor based on intricate knowledge of the errors in the system. The measurements are usually made of a real-world system, rather than of the model's incomplete representation of that system, and so a special function called the observation operator (usually depicted by h() for a nonlinear operator or H for its linearization) is needed to map the modeled variable to a form that can be directly compared with the observation. Data assimilation as statistical estimation One of the common mathematical philosophical perspectives is to view data assimilation as a Bayesian estimation problem. From this perspective, the analysis step is an application of Bayes' theorem and the overall assimilation procedure is an example of recursive Bayesian estimation. However, the probabilistic analysis is usually simplified to a computationally feasible form. Advancing the probability distribution in time would be done exactly in the general case by the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation, but that is not feasible for high-dimensional systems, so various approximations operating on simplified representations of the probability distributions are used instead. Often the probability distributions are assumed Gaussian so that they can be represented by their mean and covariance, which gives rise to the Kalman filter. Many methods represent the probability distributions only by the mean and input some pre- calculated covariance. An example of a direct (or sequential) method to compute this is called optimal statistical interpolation, or simply optimal interpolation (OI). An alternative approach is to iteratively solve a cost function that solves an identical problem. These are called variational methods, such as 3D-Var and 4D-Var. Typical minimization algorithms are the Conjugate gradient method or the Generalized minimal residual method. The Ensemble Kalman filter is sequential method that uses a Monte Carlo approach to estimate both the mean and the covariance of a Gaussian probability distribution by an ensemble of simulations. More recently, hybrid combinations of ensemble approaches and variational methods have become more popular (e.g. they are used for operational forecasts both at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)). Weather forecasting applications In numerical weather prediction applications, data assimilation is most widely known as a method for combining observations of meteorological variables such as temperature and atmospheric pressure with prior forecasts in order to initialize numerical forecast models. =Why it is necessary= The atmosphere is a fluid. The idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The process of entering observation data into the model to generate initial conditions is called initialization. On land, terrain maps available at resolutions down to globally are used to help model atmospheric circulations within regions of rugged topography, in order to better depict features such as downslope winds, mountain waves and related cloudiness that affects incoming solar radiation. The main inputs from country-based weather services are observations from devices (called radiosondes) in weather balloons that measure various atmospheric parameters and transmits them to a fixed receiver, as well as from weather satellites. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. These observations are irregularly spaced, so they are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms. Some global models use finite differences, in which the world is represented as discrete points on a regularly spaced grid of latitude and longitude; other models use spectral methods that solve for a range of wavelengths. The data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast. A variety of methods are used to gather observational data for use in numerical models. Sites launch radiosondes in weather balloons which rise through the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Information from weather satellites is used where traditional data sources are not available. Commerce provides pilot reports along aircraft routes and ship reports along shipping routes. Research projects use reconnaissance aircraft to fly in and around weather systems of interest, such as tropical cyclones. Reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems which cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance, or are expected to be of high impact from three to seven days into the future over the downstream continent. Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971. Efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific. =History= Lewis Fry Richardson In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson published the first attempt at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a hydrostatic variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations, Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis, indicating the need for a data assimilation scheme. Originally \\"subjective analysis\\" had been used in which NWP forecasts had been adjusted by meteorologists using their operational expertise. Then \\"objective analysis\\" (e.g. Cressman algorithm) was introduced for automated data assimilation. These objective methods used simple interpolation approaches, and thus were 3DDA methods. Later, 4DDA methods, called \\"nudging\\", were developed, such as in the MM5 model. They are based on the simple idea of Newtonian relaxation (the 2nd axiom of Newton). They introduce into the right part of dynamical equations of the model a term that is proportional to the difference of the calculated meteorological variable and the observed value. This term that has a negative sign keeps the calculated state vector closer to the observations. Nudging can be interpreted as a variant of the Kalman-Bucy filter (a continuous time version of the Kalman filter) with the gain matrix prescribed rather than obtained from covariances. A major development was achieved by L. Gandin (1963) who introduced the \\"statistical interpolation\\" (or \\"optimal interpolation\\") method, which developed earlier ideas of Kolmogorov. This is a 3DDA method and is a type of regression analysis which utilizes information about the spatial distributions of covariance functions of the errors of the \\"first guess\\" field (previous forecast) and \\"true field\\". These functions are never known. However, the different approximations were assumed. The optimal interpolation algorithm is the reduced version of the Kalman filtering (KF) algorithm and in which the covariance matrices are not calculated from the dynamical equations but are pre-determined in advance. Attempts to introduce the KF algorithms as a 4DDA tool for NWP models came later. However, this was (and remains) a difficult task because the full version requires solution of the enormous number of additional equations (~N*N~10**12, where N=Nx*Ny*Nz is the size of the state vector, Nx~100, Ny~100, Nz~100 ‚Äì the dimensions of the computational grid). To overcome this difficulty, approximate or suboptimal Kalman filters were developed. These include the Ensemble Kalman filter and the Reduced-Rank Kalman filters (RRSQRT).Todling and Cohn, 1994 Another significant advance in the development of the 4DDA methods was utilizing the optimal control theory (variational approach) in the works of Le Dimet and Talagrand (1986), based on the previous works of J.-L. Lions and G. Marchuk, the latter being the first to apply that theory in the environmental modeling. The significant advantage of the variational approaches is that the meteorological fields satisfy the dynamical equations of the NWP model and at the same time they minimize the functional, characterizing their difference from observations. Thus, the problem of constrained minimization is solved. The 3DDA variational methods were developed for the first time by Sasaki (1958). As was shown by Lorenc (1986), all the above-mentioned 4DDA methods are in some limit equivalent, i.e. under some assumptions they minimize the same cost function. However, in practical applications these assumptions are never fulfilled, the different methods perform differently and generally it is not clear what approach (Kalman filtering or variational) is better. The fundamental questions also arise in application of the advanced DA techniques such as convergence of the computational method to the global minimum of the functional to be minimised. For instance, cost function or the set in which the solution is sought can be not convex. The 4DDA method which is currently most successfulhttp://hfip.psu.edu/EDA2010/MZhang.pdf is hybrid incremental 4D-Var, where an ensemble is used to augment the climatological background error covariances at the start of the data assimilation time window, but the background error covariances are evolved during the time window by a simplified version of the NWP forecast model. This data assimilation method is used operationally at forecast centres such as the Met Office.http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified- model/weather-forecasting =Cost function= The process of creating the analysis in data assimilation often involves minimization of a cost function. A typical cost function would be the sum of the squared deviations of the analysis values from the observations weighted by the accuracy of the observations, plus the sum of the squared deviations of the forecast fields and the analyzed fields weighted by the accuracy of the forecast. This has the effect of making sure that the analysis does not drift too far away from observations and forecasts that are known to usually be reliable. 3D-Var J(\\\\mathbf{x}) = (\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{b})^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\mathbf{B}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{b}) + (\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathit{H}[\\\\mathbf{x}])^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathit{H}[\\\\mathbf{x}]), where \\\\mathbf{B} denotes the background error covariance, \\\\mathbf{R} the observational error covariance. abla J(\\\\mathbf{x}) = 2\\\\mathbf{B}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{b}) - 2\\\\mathit{H}^T\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathit{H}[\\\\mathbf{x}]) 4D-Var J(\\\\mathbf{x}) = (\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{b})^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\mathbf{B}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{b}) + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}(\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}-\\\\mathit{H}_{i}[\\\\mathbf{x}_{i}])^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\mathbf{R}_{i}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}-\\\\mathit{H}_{i}[\\\\mathbf{x}_{i}]) provided that \\\\mathit{H} is a linear operator (matrix). =Future development= Factors driving the rapid development of data assimilation methods for NWP models include: * Utilizing the observations currently offers promising improvement in forecast skill at a variety of spatial scales (from global to highly local) and time scales. * The number of different kinds of available observations (sodars, radars, satellite) is rapidly growing. Other applications = Monitoring water and energy transfers = General Data Assimilation diagram (Alpilles-ReSeDA) Data assimilation has been used, in the 1980s and 1990s, in several HAPEX (Hydrologic and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment) projects for monitoring energy transfers between the soil, vegetation and atmosphere. For instance: \\\\- HAPEX-MobilHy, HAPEX-Sahel, \\\\- the \\"Alpilles-ReSeDA\\" (Remote Sensing Data Assimilation) experiment, a European project in the FP4-ENV program which took place in the Alpilles region, South- East of France (1996‚Äì97). The Flow-chart diagram (right), excerpted from the final report of that project, shows how to infer variables of interest such as canopy state, radiative fluxes, environmental budget, production in quantity and quality, from remote sensing data and ancillary information. In that diagram, the small blue-green arrows indicate the direct way the models actually run. = Other forecasting applications = Data assimilation methods are currently also used in other environmental forecasting problems, e.g. in hydrological forecasting. Bayesian networks may also be used in a data assimilation approach to assess natural hazards such as landslides. Given the abundance of spacecraft data for other planets in the solar system, data assimilation is now also applied beyond the Earth to obtain re-analyses of the atmospheric state of extraterrestrial planets. Mars is the only extraterrestrial planet to which data assimilation has been applied so far. Available spacecraft data include, in particular, retrievals of temperature and dust/water ice optical thicknesses from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer onboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Climate Sounder onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Two methods of data assimilation have been applied to these datasets: an Analysis Correction scheme and two Ensemble Kalman Filter schemes,http://www.eps.jhu.edu/~mjhoffman/pages/research.htmlhttp://www.marsclimatecenter.com both using a global circulation model of the martian atmosphere as forward model. The Mars Analysis Correction Data Assimilation (MACDA) dataset is publicly available from the British Atmospheric Data Centre.http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/home/ Data assimilation is a part of the challenge for every forecasting problem. Dealing with biased data is a serious challenge in data assimilation. Further development of methods to deal with biases will be of particular use. If there are several instruments observing the same variable then intercomparing them using probability distribution functions can be instructive. The numerical forecast models are becoming of higher resolution due to the increase of computational power, with operational atmospheric models now running with horizontal resolutions of order of 1 km (e.g. at the German National Meteorological Service, the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) and Met Office in the UK). This increase in horizontal resolutions is starting to allow us to resolve more chaotic features of our non-linear models, e.g. resolve convection on the grid scale, clouds, in the atmospheric models. This increasing non-linearity in the models and observation operators poses a new problem in the data assimilation. The existing data assimilation methods such as many variants of ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods, well established with linear or near-linear models, are being assessed on non-linear models, as well as many new methods are being developed e.g. particle filters for high-dimensional problems, hybrids data assimilation methods. Other uses include trajectory estimation for the Apollo program, GPS, and atmospheric chemistry.

As preacher, pastor, lecturer and author, he attained a position of great influence in his day, he and his friends, J. A. Turretini of Geneva and S. Werenfels (1657-1740) of Basel, forming what was once called the Swiss triumvirate.Encyclop√©die des sciences religieuses, Paris, 1881, t. XI, p. 291. He was thought to show a leaning towards Socinianism and Arminianism. His innovative proposals embraced dogmatics, exegesis (his important adaptation of a translation of, and commentary on the Bible), liturgy (Bible reading instead of preaching), hymnology and moral theology (importance of good deeds and moral life). His writings had a great influence, bearing spiritual renewal among Waldensian, Dutch, German, Hungarian and Scandinavian Protestants. Moreover, the English Royal Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts ‚Äì of which he was a member ‚Äì brought his teachings to the countries of the Middle East, India, Canada and the West-Indian Islands. His highly influential oeuvre was later called \\"the second Reformation\\". In August 1746 he had a stroke in the pulpit. He died in Neuch√¢tel on 14 April 1747 after 61 years of service. His pastor's office was inherited by his son Jean Rodolphe (1687-1764). Works Ostervald's major works are: *Trait√© des sources de la corruption qui regne aujourd'huy parmi les chr√©tiens (1700), translated into English, Dutch and German, Hungarian practically a plea for a more ethical and less doctrinal type of Christianity; *Cat√©chisme ou instruction dans la religion chr√©tienne (1702), also translated into English, Dutch and German; *Trait√© contre l'impuret√© (1707); *Sermons sur divers textes (1722-1724); *Theologiae compendium (1739); and *Traduction de la Bible (1724). All his writings were popular among French Protestants; many were translated into various languages; Ostervald's Bible, a revision of the French translation, in particular, was well known in Great Britain.

A federal territory is an area that is part of a federation but not part of any federated state. The federated states constitute the federation itself and share sovereignty with the federal government, while a territory does not have sovereign status. Unlike a federal district, a territory may have some degree of self-rule, but the terms are used somewhat differently in different federations. Federal territories in various federations Federal territories include: * Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria) * Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan (Malaysia) * Australian Capital Territory, Jervis Bay Territory and Northern Territory (Australia) * Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon (Canada) In India, the federal territories are formally called union territories. There are eight of these: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry. In Pakistan, the federal territories are Islamabad Capital Territory and the disputed territories of Pakistan-administered Kashmir: Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.  Historical federal territories  = Brazil = In Brazil, although mentioned in the Federal Constitution, currently there are no federal territories. Until, 1988 there were three territories: Fernando de Noronha (today a state- level district of Pernambuco), Amap√°, and Roraima, now fully recognised states. From 1943 to 1982 Rond√¥nia was also a federal territory (until 1956 under the name of Territ√≥rio do Guapor√©). = Germany = Alsace-Lorraine's coat of arms can still be seen on the Reichstag building in Berlin (at the very top), together with the coat of arms of the other states. The German Empire was a federation of monarchies and a few city-states. However, after the Franco-Prussian War, the newly created country annexed large parts of Alsace and Lorraine, two mostly German-speaking French territories which used to belong to the Holy Roman Empire. A large part of the local population was opposed to the transfer, meaning that granting statehood to the recently acquired territory would establish a state with a possible desire for secession which also was not used to German politics and German law. Incorporating the territory into Prussia, as happened to Schleswig-Holstein and other states during the German Unification Wars, was opposed by the South German states which already felt diminished by Prussia. Hence, an annexation to Bavaria and Baden was also discussed, yet met with opposition by the military which opined that the crucial border territory had to be governed from Berlin. As a compromise, Otto von Bismarck successfully proposed to incorporate Alsace-Lorraine as a territory directly governed by the Imperial (federal) government, leading to the creation of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsa√ü-Lothringen). The territorial status, common in the US, was unique within mainland Germany, as all constituent states were self-governing. France annexed the complete area after World War I. Since then, the German national government never had direct control over a German territory, with the exception of the Nazi government; however, Nazi Germany was - like East Germany - a centralized state where state governments were de facto abolished. The Federal Republic of Germany's Basic Law does not currently provide a legal way to create a federal territory, including a capital district, and describes the German national territory as being composed solely of states. = United States = In the United States, many of the states were territories or parts of territories before reaching statehood, e.g. Louisiana Territory, Mississippi Territory, Oregon Territory, Alaska Territory and Hawaii Territory. Before reaching statehood, these territories of the United States were formally usually of a kind which can be described as \\"organized incorporated territories\\", meaning that the government of the jurisdiction was formally organized in such a way as to comply with recognized federal standards for self-government, and that the jurisdiction was \\"organic\\" to the United States, that is, an irrevocably inseverable part of it rather than a protectorate, an area leased from and still pertaining formally to another nation, or a concession granted by another nation or group which conceivably could retain certain rights to it. \\"Incorporated\\" territories are a part of the United States, though not of any particular constituent state, and as are not readily saleable or cessionable to other powers in the way that \\"unincorporated\\" territories are.

Glasse, Cyril, The New Encyclopedia of Islam, Altamira Press, 2001, p.432 While early South Asian scholarship credited him for contributing to conservative trends in Indian Islam, more recent works, notably by ter Haar, Friedman, and Buehler, have pointed to Sirhindi's significant contributions to Sufi epistemology and practices.Aziz Ahmad, Studies in Islamic Culture in the Indian Environment, Oxford University Press, 1964.

Tomb of Mujaddid e Alfsani Sirhindi's shrine, known as Rauza Sharif, is located in Sirhind, Punjab, India.  Early life and education  Ahmad Sirhindi was born on 26 May 1564 in the village of Sirhind. He received most of his early education from his father, 'Abd al-Ahad, his brother, Muhammad Sadiq and from Muhammad Tahir al-Lahuri.Itzchak Weismann, The Naqshbandiyya: Orthodoxy and Activism in a Worldwide Sufi Tradition, Routledge (2007), p. 62 He also memorised the Qur'an. He then studied in Sialkot, which had become an intellectual centre under the Kashmir-born scholar Kamaluddin Kashmiri. S.Z.H. Jafri, Recording the Progress of Indian History: Symposia Papers of the Indian History Congress, 1992-2010, Primus Books (2012), p. 156 There he learned logic, philosophy and theology and read advanced texts of tafsir and hadith under another scholar from Kashmir, Yaqub Sarfi Kashmiri (1521-1595), who was a sheikh of the tariqa Hamadaniyya Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani Sufi Order. Qazi Bahlol Badakhshani taught him jurisprudence, prophet Muhammad's biography and history.Khwaja Jamil Ahmad, One Hundred greater Muslims, Ferozsons (1984), p. 292Sufism and Shari'ah: A study of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi's effort to reform Sufism, Muhammad Abdul Haq Ansari, The Islamic Foundation, 1997, p. 11. Sirhindi also made rapid progress in the Suhrawardƒ´, the Qadirƒ´, and the Chistƒ´ traditions, and was given permission to initiate and train followers at the age of 17. He eventually joined the Naqshbandƒ´ order through the Sufi missionary Khwaja Baqi Billah, and became a leading master of this order. His deputies traversed the Mughal Empire in order to popularize the order and eventually won favour with the Mughal court.Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2006, p. 755.  Views  Ahmad Sirhindi's teaching emphasized the inter-dependence of both the Sufi path and sharia, stating that \\"what is outside the path shown by the prophet is forbidden.\\" Arthur Buehler explains that Sirhindi's concept of shariah is a multivalent and inclusive term encompassing outward acts of worship, faith, and the Sufi path. Sirhindi emphasizes Sufi initiation and practices as a necessary part of shariah, and criticizes jurists who follow only the outward aspects of the sharia. In his criticism of the superficial jurists, he states: \\"For a worm hidden under a rock, the sky is the bottom of the rock.\\"Arthur Buehler. Revealed Grace. Fons Vitae, 2014, p. 97 = Importance of Sufism in Shari‚Äôah = According to Simon Digby, \\"modern hagiographical literature emphasizes Sirhindi's reiterated profession of strict Islamic orthodoxy, his exaltation of the shariah and exhortations towards its observance.\\"Review by Simon Digby of Yohanan Friedmann Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi: an outline of his thought and a study of his image in the eyes of posterity, McGill-Queen's University Press, 1971 Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 38, No. 1 (1975), pp. 177-179 On the other hand, Yohanan Friedmann questions how committed Sirhindi was to shariah by commenting: \\"it is noteworthy that while Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi never wearies of describing the minutest details of Sufi experience, his exhortations to comply with the shariah remain general to an extreme.\\"Review by Simon Digby of Yohanan Friedmann Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi: an outline of his thought and a study of his image in the eyes of posterity, McGill-Queen's University Press, 1971, p.42 Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 38, No. 1 (1975), pp. 177-179 Friedmann also claims \\"Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi was primarily a Sufi interested first and foremost in questions of mysticism.\\".Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi: an outline of his thought and a study of his image in the eyes of posterity, McGill-Queen's University Press, 1971, p.xiv Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 38, No. 1 (1975), pp. 177-179 Sirhindi wrote a letter to mughal emperor Jehangir emphasizing that he is now correcting the wrong path taken by his father, emperor Akbar. = Oneness of appearance and oneness of being = Ahmad Sirhindi advanced the notion of wahdat ash-shuh≈´d (oneness of appearance). According to this doctrine, the experience of unity between God and creation is purely subjective and occurs only in the mind of the Sufi who has reached the state of fana' fi Allah (to forget about everything except Almighty Allah). Sirhindi considered wahdat ash-shuh≈´d to be superior to wahdat al-wuj≈´d (oneness of being), which he understood to be a preliminary step on the way to the Absolute Truth.Annemarie Schimmel, Islam in the Indian Subcontinent, p. 94. Despite this, Sirhindi still used Ibn al-'Arabi's vocabulary without hesitation. Sirhindi writes: > I wonder that Shaykh Muhyƒ´ 'l-Dƒ´n appears in vision to be one of those with > whom God is pleased, while most of his ideas which differ from the doctrines > of the People of truth appear to be wrong and mistaken. It seems that since > they are due to error in kashf, he has been forgiven... I consider him as > one of those with whom God is well-pleased; on the other hand, I believe > that all his ideas in which he opposes (the people of truth) are wrong and > harmful.Sufism and Shari'ah: A study of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi's effort to > reform Sufism, Muhammad Abdul Haq Ansari, The Islamic Foundation, 1997, > p.247 On the other hand, William C. Chittick, a prominent Ibn 'Arabi scholar, writes: > When Sirhindƒ´ explains the meaning of wa·∏•dat al-wuj≈´d, he demonstrates > little acquaintance with the writings of Ibn  øArabƒ´ or his major followers. > By insisting that it was an inadequate expression of the nature of things > and that it needed to be supplanted by wa·∏•dat al-shuh≈´d, he was taking for > granted that it was the teaching of Ibn  øArabƒ´ and that wuj≈´d was being used > in the philosophical sense. He seemed not to recognize that Ibn  øArabƒ´ used > it to mean ‚Äúfinding‚Äù and ‚Äúwitnessing‚Äù as well as ‚Äúbeing‚Äù and ‚Äúexistence.‚Äù > So, at least partly because Sirhindƒ´ was oblivious to the meaning of wuj≈´d > as finding and perceiving, he felt it necessary to insist that seeing God in > all things goes back to the viewer. The unity achieved on the path to God, > he claimed, is that of shuh≈´d, not that of wuj≈´d. But, for Ibn  øArabƒ´ and > many of his followers these two words meant the same thing. So Sirhindƒ´ not > only ascribes a doctrine to Ibn  øArabƒ´ that he does not profess‚Äîwa·∏•dat al- > wuj≈´d‚Äîbut he also understands wuj≈´d in a way that is not compatible with Ibn >  øArabƒ´‚Äôs use of the word. = Reality of the Quran and Ka'ba versus the reality of Muhammad = Tomb Of Ahmad Sirhindi, Sirhindi's shrine, known as Rauza Sharif Sirhindi had originally declared the reality of the Quran (haqiqat-i quran) and the reality of the Ka'ba (haqiqat-i ka'ba-yi rabbani) to be above the reality of Muhammad (haqiqat-i Muhammadi). This caused fury of opposition, particularly among certain Sufis and ulama of Hijaz who objected to the Ka'ba having exalted spiritual \\"rank\\" than the Prophet. Sirhindi argued in response that the reality of the Prophet is superior to any creature. The real Ka'ba is worthy of prostration since it is not created and is covered with the veil of nonexistence. It is this Ka'ba in the essence of God that Sirhindi was referring to as the reality of the Ka'ba, not the appearance of the Ka'ba (surat-i ka'ba), which is only a stone. By the latter part of the nineteenth century, the consensus of the Naqshbandi community had placed the prophetic realities closer to God than the divine realities. The rationale for this development may have been to neutralize unnecessary discord with the large Muslim community whose emotional attachment to Muhammad was greater than any understanding of philosophical fine points. Sufi lineage = Naqshbandi chain = Naqshbandi Sufis claim that Ahmad Sirhindi is descended from a long line of \\"spiritual masters\\" all the way up to prophet Muhammad. # Muhammad, d. 11 AH, buried in Medina, Saudi Arabia (570/571‚Äì632 CE) # Abu Bakar Siddique, d. 13 AH, buried in Medina, Saudi Arabia # Salman al-Farsi, d. 35 AH, buried in Madaa'in, Saudi Arabia # Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, d. 107 AH, buried in Medina, Saudi Arabia. # Jafar Sadiq, d. 148 AH, buried in Medina, Saudi Arabia. # Bayazid Bastami, d. 261 AH, buried in Bastaam, Iran (804 - 874 CE). # Abu al-Hassan al-Kharaqani, d. 425 AH, buried Kharqaan, Iran. # Abul Qasim Gurgani, d. 450 AH, buried in Gurgan, Iran. # Abu ali Farmadi, d. 477 AH, buried in Tous, Khorasan, Iran. # Abu Yaqub Yusuf Hamadani, d. 535 AH, buried in Maru, Khorosan, Iran. # Abdul Khaliq Ghujdawani, d. 575 AH, buried in Ghajdawan, Bukhara, Uzbekistan. # Arif Riwgari, d. 616 AH, buried in Reogar, Bukhara, Uzbekistan. # Mahmood Anjir-Faghnawi, d. 715 AH, buried in Waabakni, Mawarannahr, Uzbekistan. # Azizan Ali Ramitani, d. 715 AH, buried in Khwarezm, Bukhara, Uzbekistan. # Mohammad Baba As-Samasi, d. 755 AH, buried in Samaas, Bukhara, Uzbekistan. # Amir Kulal, d. 772 AH, buried in Saukhaar, Bukhara, Uzbekistan. # Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari, d. 791 AH, buried in Qasr-e- Aarifan, Bukhara, Uzbekistan (1318‚Äì1389 CE). # Ala'uddin Attar Bukhari, buried in Jafaaniyan, Mawranahar, Uzbekistan. # Yaqub Charkhi, d. 851 AH, buried in Tajikistan # Ubaidullah Ahrar, d. 895 AH, buried in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. # Muhammad Zahid Wakhshi, d. 936 AH, buried in Wakhsh, Malk Hasaar, Tajikistan # Durwesh Muhammad, d. 970 AH, buried in Samarkand, Uzbekistan # Muhammad Amkanagi, d. 1008 AH, buried in Akang, Bukhara, Uzbekistan # Khwaja Baqi Billah, d. 1012 AH, buried in Delhi, India # Ahmad al-Far≈´qƒ´ al-Sirhindƒ´ References #  øUmdat al-MaqƒÅmƒÅt # Zubdat al-MaqƒÅmƒÅt # ·∏§a·∏çrƒÅt al-Quds, by Shaykh Badruddƒ´n Sirhindƒ´ # Silsi·∏ªa MashƒÅikh MohrƒÅ Sharƒ´f # Rau·∏çat al-Qayy≈´miya (volume 1), by Shaykh Muhammad I·∏•sƒÅn Mujaddidƒ´  See also  *Mujaddid *Ali Hujwiri  References   Further reading  * Dr. Burhan Ahmad Faruqi, Mujaddid‚Äôs Conception of Tawhid, 1940 * Shari'at and Ulama in Ahmad Sirhindi's Collected Letters by Arthur F.

He is generally considered to have been one of the world's leading horn players.  Early life and education  Barry Tuckwell was born on 5 March 1931 in Melbourne, son of Charles Tuckwell, an organist, Tuckwell, Charles. \\"When wattles bloom [music] / music by Charles Tuckwell ; words by A.I. Mockendge\\", University Library Catalogue of the University of Melbourne, 1931-1940. and his wife Elizabeth. March 5 is known by many as the Horn Duumvirate Date, as it was the birth date of both Tuckwell and Philip Farkas, both highly regarded horn players. He had an older sister, Patricia, a violinist and fashion model widely known as Bambi. She married the photographer Athol Shmith and later George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood, a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. After studying the piano, organ and violin as a chorister at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, Tuckwell was introduced to the French horn at age 13 and was playing professionally within six months. He studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music under Alan Mann, one of Australia's most influential brass players. Tuckwell has said, \\"The horn chose me. Right from the beginning, it was something I knew I could do.\\" Tuckwell related an anecdote regarding his choice of instrument: sitting in a cafe one day with his sister Patricia, Charles Mackerras and a horn player from the local symphony, Patricia speculated on what Tuckwell's future in music might be. The horn player suggested, \\"Why not try the horn?\\" Tuckwell did so and within two years was playing in the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Profile, Minnesota Public Radio. With characteristic humour, when recounting this at the British Horn Society's festival in 2005, he turned to the audience and said, \\"One note a time, piece of cake!\\" The horn is often reckoned to be one of the most difficult orchestral instruments to master.The Horn Player, Summer 2005  Performing career  =Orchestral= At 15, Tuckwell was appointed by Joseph Post as third horn with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. A year later, he joined the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Eugene Goossens, where he remained for three and a half years before leaving for England. His first appointment in 1951 was with the Hall√© Orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli.Kennedy, 1985, p. 669 After two years, he went to the Scottish National Orchestra under Karl Rankl and a year later to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra under Charles Groves. In 1955, he was appointed first horn with the London Symphony Orchestra. During his 13 years with the LSO, a co- operative orchestra run by the players, he was elected to the Board of Directors and was Chairman of the Board for six years. The chief conductors during this time were Josef Krips, Pierre Monteux, Istv√°n Kert√©sz and Andr√© Previn. =Soloist= He resigned from the orchestra in 1968 to pursue a career as a soloist and conductor. For the next thirty years, he carved out a career exclusively as soloist ‚Äî one of the few horn virtuosos to have done so , rather than combining occasional concert performances with an orchestral position or a teaching post. At the age of 65, he decided to retire. His last concert was with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 1997, at the age of 65. He was one of the most recorded horn soloists, having made over 50 recordings. He has received three Grammy Award nominations. =Chamber music= In 1962 he formed a trio with Brenton Langbein (violin) and Maureen Jones (piano) for a performance of the Horn Trio by Don Banks, which was commissioned by the Edinburgh Festival. The trio played together for many years, touring in Europe, Asia and Australia until the death of Brenton Langbein. They recorded the Banks Trio, the Brahms Trio, and Quatre Petites Pi√®ces by Charles Koechlin for Tudor records. He formed a wind quintet in 1968, which also toured internationally. =Conducting= Tuckwell was also well known as a conductor, appearing with leading orchestras in Europe and the United States. For four seasons he was Chief Conductor of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and in 1982 founded the Maryland Symphony Orchestra. He enjoyed a long association with the Northern Sinfonia and was appointed their Guest Conductor following an acclaimed fourteen-concert tour of North America. Recordings as a conductor include three CDs with the London Symphony Orchestra of music by Dvo≈ô√°k, Elgar and Wagner. More recently, he conducted the West Australian Symphony Orchestra in an ABC Classics recording of the Mozart horn concertos with soloist Lin Jiang and The Queensland Orchestra for Melba Recordings of horn concertos with Ben Jacks.  Works written for Tuckwell  Many composers wrote works for Barry Tuckwell. Oliver Knussen, Don Banks, Gunther Schuller, Robin Holloway, and Thea Musgrave wrote concertos; Richard Rodney Bennett wrote \\"Acteon\\" for horn and large orchestra at Tuckwell's request.  Writings  Barry Tuckwell wrote three important books on the horn and horn playing. For the Yehudi Menuhin Music Guides, he wrote the book on the horn. His definitive manual Playing the Horn was published by Oxford University Press (now out of print) as was Fifty First Exercises. Teaching Tuckwell was known for his master classes. He was Artist-in-Residence at Dartmouth College and Pomona College in the United States, and was Professor of Horn at the Royal Academy of Music in London from 1963 until 1974. He served as Distinguished Visiting Faculty at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in the 1980s and 1990s. He held the position of Professorial Fellow at the University of Melbourne and for several years hosted the annual Barry Tuckwell Institute at Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, Colorado. Awards and honours Tuckwell was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1992.It's an Honour: AC Among the many other awards he has received are an Honorary Doctor of Music from the University of Sydney, Fellow of the Royal College of Music, Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, the George Peabody Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Music in America, the Andrew White Medal from Loyola College, the Harriet Cohen Memorial Award, the J. C. Williamson Award, and most recently, the Sir Bernard Heinze Award for outstanding contribution to music in Australia. He was also an honorary member of both the Royal Academy of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. He was the first president of the International Horn Society and was honorary president of the British Horn Society and the patron of the Melbourne International Festival of Brass. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.Delta Omicron In 2007, Tuckwell received the JC Williamson Award for his life's work in the live performance industry. Death Tuckwell died in Melbourne, aged 88, on 16 January 2020 of complications from heart disease.

She was scrapped in 1934. History Sumner was named for Allen M. Sumner. She was laid down at San Francisco, California, on 27 August 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 27 November 1920; sponsored by Miss Margaret Sumner; and commissioned on 27 May 1921, Lieutenant Commander Donald B. Beary in command. Four days later, Sumner joined Destroyer Division 49, Squadron 13, Flotilla 2 of the Pacific Fleet. Her naval career lasted almost nine years and occurred during a period of relative naval calm. On only four occasions did she depart from her routine of training, maneuvers, and patrols. The first such break came in 1924, when the revolution against the Obreg√≥n government in Mexico rose to such intensity that the lives and property of Americans in the country were endangered. Accordingly, on 17 January, while was dispatched to Tampico, Sumner and five other destroyers joined in sailing to Veracruz to protect the resident Americans. Sumner resumed her normal west coast operations in early April 1924 and was so employed until mid-1925. On 1 July 1925, she joined the Battle Fleet and a division of light cruisers from the Scouting Force in departing Pearl Harbor for a cruise to Australia and New Zealand. The force visited Pago Pago, Samoa, then continued on to Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, and to Auckland, Lyttelton, Wellington, and Dunedin, New Zealand. The fleet returned to the west coast on 26 September, and Sumner resumed training duties and patrols. In March 1927, she transited the Panama Canal to participate in maneuvers in the Atlantic Ocean. During that cruise and the maneuvers, she made it as far north as Boston, Massachusetts, before returning to the Pacific Ocean in June 1927. After a voyage to Hawaii and operations in that area, conducted in 1928, Sumner returned to her activities along the west coast until the spring of 1930. Fate On 29 March 1930, she was decommissioned at San Diego, California, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 18 November. Between then and 1934, she continued to serve the Navy - first as a barracks ship for submarine crews; then as a test ship for structural strength tests. Finally, on 12 June 1934, her hulk was sold in accordance with the terms of the London Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armaments. See for other ships of this name.

The motion of the muon spin is due to the magnetic field experienced by the particle and may provide information on its local environment in a very similar way to other magnetic resonance techniques, such as electron spin resonance (ESR or EPR) and, more closely, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  Acronym  In analogy with the acronyms for these previously established spectroscopies, the muon spin spectroscopy is also known as ¬µSR, which stands for muon spin rotation, or relaxation, or resonance, depending respectively on whether the muon spin motion is predominantly a rotation (more precisely a precession around a still magnetic field), or a relaxation towards an equilibrium direction, or, again, a more complex dynamics dictated by the addition of short radio frequency pulses. The intention of the mnemonic acronym was to draw attention to the analogy with NMR and ESR. More generally speaking, the abbreviation covers any study of the interactions of the muon's magnetic moment with its surroundings when implanted into any kind of matter.  How it works  =Introduction= ¬µSR is an atomic, molecular and condensed matter experimental technique that exploits nuclear detection methods. Although particles are used as a probe, it is not a diffraction technique. Its two main features are the local nature of the muon probe, due to the short effective range of its interactions with matter, and the characteristic time-window (10‚àí13 ‚Äì 10‚àí5 s) of the dynamical processes in atomic, molecular and condensed media that can be investigated by this technique. The closest parallel to ¬µSR is \\"pulsed NMR\\", in which one observes time-dependent transverse nuclear polarization or the so-called \\"free induction decay\\" of the nuclear polarization. However, a key difference is that in ¬µSR one uses a specifically implanted spin (the muon's) and does not rely on internal nuclear spins. In addition, and due to the specificity of the muon, the ¬µSR technique does not require any radio-frequency technique to align the probing spin. On the other hand, a clear distinction between the ¬µSR technique and those involving neutrons or X-rays is that scattering is not involved. Neutron diffraction techniques, for example, use the change in energy and/or momentum of a scattered neutron to deduce the sample properties. In contrast, the implanted muons are not diffracted but remain in a sample until they decay. Only a careful analysis of the decay product (i.e. a positron) provides information about the interaction between the implanted muon and its environment in the sample. As with many of the other nuclear methods, ¬µSR relies on discoveries and developments made in the field of particle physics. Following the discovery of the muon by Seth Neddermeyer and Carl D. Anderson in 1936, pioneer experiments on its properties were performed with cosmic rays. Indeed, with one muon hitting each square centimeter of the earth's surface every minute, the muons constitute the foremost constituent of cosmic rays arriving at ground level. However, ¬µSR experiments require muon fluxes of the order of 10^4-10^7 muons per second and square centimeter. Such fluxes can only be obtained in high-energy particle accelerators which have been developed during the last 50 years. =Muon production= The collision of an accelerated proton beam (typical energy 600 MeV) with the nuclei of a production target produces positive pions (\\\\pi^+) via the possible reactions: : \\\\begin{array}{lll} p + p & \\\\rightarrow & p + n + \\\\pi^+ p + n & \\\\rightarrow & n + n + \\\\pi^+ \\\\end{array} From the subsequent weak decay of the pions ( MEAN lifetime \\\\tau_{\\\\pi^+} = 26.03 ns) positive muons (\\\\mu^+) are formed via the two body decay: : \\\\pi^+ \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu^+ + u_{\\\\mu} . Parity violation in the weak interactions implies that only left-handed neutrinos exist, with their spin antiparallel to their linear momentum (likewise only right-handed anti-neutrino are found in nature). Since the pion is spinless both the neutrino and the \\\\mu^+ are ejected with spin antiparallel to their momentum in the pion rest frame. This is the key to provide spin-polarised muon beams. According to the value of the pion momentum different types of \\\\mu^+-beams are available for ¬µSR measurements. High-energy beam The first type of muon beam is formed by the pions escaping the production target at high energies. They are collected over a certain solid angle by quadrupole magnets and directed on to a decay section consisting of a long superconducting solenoid with a field of several Tesla. If the pion momentum is not too high, a large fraction of the pions will have decayed before they reach the end of the solenoid. In the laboratory frame the polarization of a high-energy muon beam is limited to about 80% and its energy is of the order of ~40-50MeV. Although such a high energy beam requires the use of suitable moderators and samples with sufficient thickness, it guarantees a homogeneous implantation of the muons in the sample volume. Such beams are also used to study specimens inside of recipients, e.g. samples inside pressure cells. Such muon beams are available at PSI, TRIUMF, J-PARC and RIKEN-RAL. Surface beam The second type of muon beam is often called the surface or Arizona beam (recalling the pioneer works of Pifer et al. from the University of Arizona). Here muons are used that arise from pions decaying at rest still inside, but near the surface, of the production target. Such muons, which are 100% polarized, ideally monochromatic and have a very low momentum of 29.8 MeV/c, which corresponds to a kinetic energy of 4.1 MeV, have a range width in matter of the order of 180 mg/cm2. Hence the paramount advantage of this type of beam is the possibility to use relatively thin samples. Such muon beams are available at PSI (Swiss Muon Source S¬µS), TRIUMF, J-PARC, ISIS Neutron and Muon Source and RIKEN-RAL. Low-energy muon beam Finally, positive muon beams of even lower energy (ultra slow muons with energy down to the eV-keV range) can be obtained by further reducing the energy of an Arizona beam by utilizing the energy-loss characteristics of large band-gap solid moderators. This technique was pioneered by researchers at the TRIUMF cyclotron facility in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. It was christened with the acronym, ŒºSOL (muon separator on-line) and initially employed LiF as the moderating solid. The same 1986 paper also reported the observation of negative Muonium ions (i.e., Mu‚àí or Œº+ e‚àí e‚àí) in vacuum. In 1987, the slow Œº+ production rate was increased 100-fold using thin-film rare-gas solid moderators, producing a usable flux of low-energy positive muons. This production technique was subsequently adopted by the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) for their low-energy positive muon beam facility. The tunable energy range of such muon beams corresponds to implantation depths in solids of less than a nanometer up to several hundred nanometers. Therefore, the study of magnetic properties as a function of the distance from the surface of the sample is possible. At the present time, PSI is the only facility where such a low-energy muon beam is available on a regular basis. Technical developments have been also conducted at RIKEN-RAL, but with a strongly reduced low-energy muons rate. J-PARC is projecting the development of a high-intensity low-energy muon beam. =Different types of muon sources: continuous vs. pulsed= In addition to the above-mentioned classification based on energy, muon beams are also divided according to the time structure of the particle accelerator, i.e. continuous or pulsed. For continuous muon sources no dominating time structure is present. By selecting an appropriate muon incoming rate, muons are implanted into the sample one by one. The main advantage is that the time resolution is solely determined by the detector construction and the read-out electronics. There are two main limitations for this type of sources: (i) unrejected charged particles accidentally hitting the detectors produce non-negligible random background counts; this compromises measurements after a few muon lifetimes, when the random background exceeds the true decay events; (ii) the requirement to detect muons one at a time sets a maximum event rate. The background problem can be reduced by the use of electrostatic deflectors to ensure that no muons enter the sample before the decay of the previous muon. PSI and TRIUMF host the two continuous muon sources available for ¬µSR experiments. At pulsed muon sources protons hitting the production target are bunched into short, intense and widely separated pulses, that provide a similar time structure in the secondary muon beam. An advantage of pulsed muon sources is that the event rate is only limited by detectors construction. Furthermore, detectors are active only after the incoming muon pulse, strongly reducing the accidental background counts. The virtual absence of background allows the extension of the time window for measurements up to about ten times the muon mean lifetime. The reverse of the medal is that the width of the muon pulse limits the time resolution. ISIS Neutron and Muon Source and J-PARC are the two pulsed muon sources available for ¬µSR experiments. =The technique= Muon implantation The muons are implanted into the sample of interest where they lose energy very quickly. Fortunately, this deceleration process occurs in such a way that it does not jeopardize a ŒºSR measurement. On one side it is very fast (much faster than 100 ps), which is much shorter than a typical ŒºSR time window (up to 20 Œºs), and on the other side, all the processes involved during the deceleration are Coulombic (ionization of atoms, electron scattering, electron capture) in origin and do not interact with the muon spin, so that the muon is thermalized without any significant loss of polarization. The positive muons usually adopt interstitial sites of the crystallographic lattice. In most metallic samples the muon's positive charge is collectively screened by a cloud of conduction electrons. Thus, in metals, the muon is in a so-called diamagnetic state and behave like a free muon. In insulators or semiconductors a collective screening cannot take place and the muon will usually pick-up one electron and form a so-called muonium (Mu=Œº++e‚àí), which has similar size (Bohr radius), reduced-mass and ionization energy to the hydrogen atom. Detecting the muon polarization The decay of the positive muon into a positron and two neutrinos occurs via the weak interaction process after a mean lifetime of œÑŒº = 2.197034(21) Œºs: : \\\\mu^+ \\\\rightarrow e^+ + u_e + \\\\bar{ u}_{\\\\mu}~. Parity violation in the weak interaction leads in this more complicated case (three body decay) to an anisotropic distribution of the positron emission with respect to the spin direction of the Œº+ at the decay time. The positron emission probability is given by : W(\\\\theta)d\\\\theta \\\\propto (1 + a\\\\cos\\\\theta)d\\\\theta~, where \\\\theta is the angle between the positron trajectory and the Œº+-spin, and a is an intrinsic asymmetry parameter determined by the weak decay mechanism. This anisotropic emission constitutes in fact the basics for the ŒºSR technique. The average asymmetry A is measured over a statistical ensemble of implanted muons and it depends on further experimental parameters, such as the beam spin polarization P_{\\\\mu}, close to one, as already mentioned. Theoretically A =1/3 is obtained if all emitted positrons are detected with the same efficiency, irrespective of their energy. Practically, values of A ‚âà 0.25 are routinely obtained. The muon spin motion may be measured over a time scale dictated by the muon decay, i.e. a few times œÑŒº, roughly 10 ¬µs. The asymmetry in the muon decay correlates the positron emission and the muon spin directions. The simplest example is when the spin direction of all muons remains constant in time after implantation (no motion). In this case the asymmetry shows up as an imbalance between the positron counts in two equivalent detectors placed in front and behind the sample, along the beam axis. Each of them records an exponentially decaying rate as a function of the time t elapsed from implantation, according to :N_\\\\alpha(t)=N_0 \\\\exp(-t/\\\\tau_\\\\mu) (1+\\\\alpha A) with \\\\alpha=\\\\pm 1 for the detector looking towards and away from the spin arrow, respectively. Considering that the huge muon spin polarization is completely outside thermal equilibrium, a dynamical relaxation towards the equilibrium unpolarized state typically shows up in the count rate, as an additional decay factor in front of the experimental asymmetry parameter, A. A magnetic field parallel to the initial muon spin direction probes the dynamical relaxation rate as a function of the additional muon Zeeman energy, without introducing additional coherent spin dynamics. This experimental arrangement is called Longitudinal Field (LF) ŒºSR. Another simple example is when implanted all muon spins precess coherently around the same magnetic field of modulus B, perpendicular to the beam axis, causing the count unbalance to oscillate at the corresponding Larmor frequency \\\\omega between the same two detectors, according to :N_\\\\alpha(t)=N_0 \\\\exp(-t/\\\\tau_\\\\mu) (1+\\\\alpha A\\\\cos\\\\omega t) Since the Larmor frequency is \\\\omega=\\\\gamma_\\\\mu B, with a gyromagnetic ratio \\\\gamma_\\\\mu=851.616 Mrad(sT)‚àí1, the frequency spectrum obtained by means of this experimental arrangement (usually referred to as Transverse Field, TF ŒºSR) provides a direct measure of the internal magnetic field intensity distribution.  Applications  Muon spin rotation and relaxation are mostly performed with positive muons. They are well suited to the study of magnetic fields at the atomic scale inside matter, such as those produced by various kinds of magnetism and/or superconductivity encountered in compounds occurring in nature or artificially produced by modern material science. The London penetration depth is one of the most important parameters characterizing a superconductor because its inverse square provides a measure of the density ns of Cooper pairs. The dependence of ns on temperature and magnetic field directly indicates the symmetry of the superconducting gap. Muon spin spectroscopy provides a way to measure the penetration depth, and so has been used to study high-temperature cuprate superconductors since their discovery in 1986. Other important fields of application of ¬µSR exploit the fact that positive muons capture electrons to form muonium atoms which behave chemically as light isotopes of the hydrogen atom. This allows investigation of the largest known kinetic isotope effect in some of the simplest types of chemical reactions, as well as the early stages of formation of radicals in organic chemicals. Muonium is also studied as an analogue of hydrogen in semiconductors, where hydrogen is one of the most ubiquitous impurities.  Facilities  ¬µSR requires a particle accelerator for the production of a muon beam. This is presently achieved at few large scale facilities in the world: the CMMS continuous source at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada; the S¬µS continuous source at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Villigen, Switzerland; the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source and RIKEN-RAL pulsed sources at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Chilton, United Kingdom; and the J-PARC facility in Tokai, Japan, where a new pulsed source is being built to replace that at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. Muon beams are also available at the Laboratory of Nuclear Problems, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. The International Society for ¬µSR Spectroscopy (ISMS) exists to promote the worldwide advancement of ¬µSR. Membership in the society is open free of charge to all individuals in academia, government laboratories and industry who have an interest in the society's goals.

Blakemore first visited China in 1974, during the Cultural Revolution, and collaborated in research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Biophysics, Beijing, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His efforts to develop scientific relations between the United Kingdom and China were recognised in 2012 when he received the Friendship Award, the People's Republic of China's highest award for \\"foreign experts who have made outstanding contributions to the country's economic and social progress\\". In 2012 he was appointed a Master of the Beijing DeTao Masters Academy. Despite a serious illness in his teens, Blakemore developed a lifelong interest in fitness and sport, especially long-distance running. He has completed 18 marathons and won the veteran's section for the British team at the Athens Centenary Marathon in 1996. Blakemore is married to Andr√©e Washbourne, whom he met when they were both 15. They have three daughters. Research Blakemore's research has focused on vision, the early development of the brain and, more recently, conditions such as stroke and Huntington's disease. He has published scientific papers and a number of books on these subjects. His contribution to neuroscience is the part he played in establishing the concept of neuronal plasticity, the capacity of the brain to reorganise itself as a result of the pattern of activity passing through its connections. Blakemore was one of the first, in the late 1960s, to demonstrate that the visual part of the cerebral cortex undergoes active, adaptive change during a critical period shortly after birth, and he argued that this helps the brain to match itself to the sensory environment. He went on to show that such plasticity results from changes in the shape and structure of nerve cells and the distribution of nerve fibres, and also from the selective death of nerve cells. Although initially controversial, the idea that the mammalian brain is 'plastic' and adaptive is now a dominant theme in neuroscience. The plasticity of connections between nerve cells is thought to underlie many different types of learning and memory, as well as sensory development. The changes in organisation can be remarkably rapid, even in adults. Blakemore has shown that the visual parts of the human cortex become responsive to input from the other senses, especially touch, in people who have been blind since shortly after birth. After stroke or other forms of brain injury, reorganisation of this sort can help the process of recovery, as other parts of the brain take over the function of the damaged part. Blakemore's recent work has emphasized the variety of molecular mechanisms that contribute to plasticity and has identified some of the genes involved in enabling nerve cells to modify their connections in response to the flow of nerve impulses through them. He summarised research on brain plasticity in his 2005 Harveian Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians and explored the role of plasticity in human cultural evolution in his 2010 Ferrier Lecture at the Royal Society. He is currently serving on the Editorial Board of the journal Neuroscience of Consciousness. Public engagement and public service In parallel with his academic career, Blakemore has championed the communication of science and engagement with the public on controversial and challenging aspects. In 1976, at the age of 32, he was the youngest person to give the BBC Reith Lectures for which he presented a series of six talks entitled Mechanics of the Mind. He has subsequently presented or contributed to hundreds of radio and television broadcasts. He gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in 1982‚Äì3, and he has written and presented many other programmes about science, including a 13-part series, The Mind Machine on BBC television, a radio series about artificial intelligence, Machines with Minds, and a documentary for Channel 4 television, God and the Scientists. He writes for British and overseas newspapers, especially The Guardian, The Observer, the Daily Telegraph and The Times. He has also written or edited several popular science books, including Mechanics of the Mind, The Mind Machine. Gender and Society, Mindwaves, Images and Understanding and The Oxford Companion to the Body. Since 2004 he has been Honorary President of the Association of British Science Writers. In 1989, when Blakemore was awarded the Royal Society's Michael Faraday Prize for his work in public communication, the citation described him as \\"one of Britain's most influential communicators of science\\". Blakemore has won many other awards for his work in public communication and education, including the Phi Beta Kappa Award for contribution to the literature of science, the John P McGovern Science and Society Medal from Sigma Xi, the Edinburgh Medal from the City of Edinburgh and the Science Educator Award from the Society for Neuroscience. Blakemore has worked for many medical charities and not-for-profit organizations, including SANE, the International Brain Injury Association, Headway, Sense (The National Deafblind & Rubella Association), the Louise T Blouin Foundation, Sense about Science and the Pilgrim Trust. He is President of the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Brain Tumour Charity, Vice President of the Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Association and a Patron of Dignity in Dying. He helped the Dana Foundation of New York to establish the European Dana Alliance for the Brain, an alliance of leading European neuroscientists who are committed to raising awareness of the importance of brain research. A large donation from the Dana Foundation to the Science Museum completed the funding for the Dana Centre on Queen's Gate in London, which became a focus for public engagement with science. He has been a Fellow of the World Economic Forum, and he is Honorary President of the World Cultural Council, a member of the World Federation of Scientists and a patron of Humanists UK. He is one of the patrons of the Oxford University Scientific Society and an Honorary Member of the Cambridge Union Society. He is Deputy Chair of the Board of Directors of the Campaign for Science and Engineering. Blakemore has served in an advisory role for several UK government departments and also for agencies, foundations and government departments overseas. He was a member of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (the Stewart Committee) in 1999-2000 and was an advisor to the Police Federation and the Home Office on the safety of telecommunications systems. He chairs the General Advisory Committee on Science at the Food Standards Agency and is a member of the Wilton Park Advisory Council (Foreign and Commonwealth Office). He has a long-standing interest in policy on drugs of abuse, and is a Commissioner of the UK Drug Policy Commission, an adviser to the Beckley Foundation and a Trustee of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs. He was an author of an influential paper published in the Lancet in 2007, introducing a rational, evidence-based system for assessing the harms of drugs, which suggested that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful than many illegal drugs. He is a member of the Longevity Science Advisory Panel of Legal & General, he sits on the European Advisory Board of Princeton University PressPrinceton University Press, European Advisory Board and he has served as a scientific advisor to the Technology Development Committee of Abu Dhabi.http://www.tdc.gov.ae Animal testing and animal rights Blakemore is outspoken in his support of the use of animal testing in medical research, though he has publicly denounced fox hunting and animal testing for cosmetics. He came to the attention of the animal rights movement while at Oxford University in the 1980s, when he carried out research into amblyopia and strabismus, conducting experiments that involved sewing kittens' eyelids shut from birth in order to study the development of their visual cortex. Blakemore has said of the research that it was directly applicable to humans, and that \\"[t]hanks to it, and similar research, we now know why conditions like amblyopia ‚Äì the most common form of child blindness ‚Äì occur and are now able to tackle it and think of ways of preventing it.\\" Subsequently, according to The Observer, he and his family \\"endured assaults by masked terrorists, bombs sent to his children, letters laced with razor blades, a suicide bid by his wife, and more than a decade of attacks and abuse.\\" In 1992, together with Les Ward of the anti-vivisection group Advocates for Animals, he co-founded a bipartisan think tank called the Boyd Group, to consider issues relating to animal experimentation. In 1998, during the 68-day hunger strike of British animal-rights activist Barry Horne, Blakemore's life was threatened in a statement released by Robin Webb of the Animal Liberation Press Office on behalf of the Animal Rights Militia. Direct action against him has abated since the prosecution of Cynthia O'Neill for harassing him in 2000.Fleet, Michael and Davies, Caroline. \\"Animal rights woman must keep away from don's home\\". The Daily Telegraph, 24 February 2000. Blakemore has advocated frank and full public debate about animal research and has worked to persuade other researchers to be more open. He has been chair of the Coalition for Medical Progress, the Research Defence Society and Understanding Animal Research, an organisation devoted to making the case for responsible use of animals in research, which was launched in 2008. Medical Research Council In 2003, Blakemore succeeded Professor Sir George Radda as the head of the Medical Research Council, a national organisation that supports medical science with an annual budget of more than ¬£700 million. The reputation of the Medical Research Council had been damaged by what was perceived as financial mismanagement, the introduction of unpopular funding schemes and a lack of transparency in its dealings with researchers. Blakemore launched a national roadshow to consult the scientific community and quickly changed the mechanisms for handling funds, rationalised the grant schemes, introduced new forms of support for young researchers and overhauled the communications policies of the MRC. He maintained his research activity in Oxford during his period of office and said \\"I want to be seen as the scientist, not the bureaucrat at the top. No, I want to be seen as the scientist in the middle.\\"Fazackerley, Anna. \\"Colin Blakemore: Professor No?\\" The Guardian 11 November 2003. https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/11/health.education Blakemore initiated a comprehensive review of the MRC's strategy and argued for a stronger commitment to clinical research and to the translation of basic research into benefits for patients. These actions anticipated Sir David Cooksey's 2006 \\"Review of UK health research funding\\", which resulted in closer working between the MRC and the Departments of Health, but which recommended that \\"funding levels for basic science should be sustained\\". In the Comprehensive Spending Review at the end of Blakemore's term of office, the budget of the MRC was increased by more than one third over three years. He was succeeded at the MRC by Leszek Borysiewicz. On the completion of his appointment at the MRC in 2007, Blakemore returned to a Professorship of Neuroscience at Oxford before his appointment at the University of London in 2012. Insignia of a Knight Bachelor =Honours controversy= Soon after his appointment to the MRC The Sunday Times published a leaked British Cabinet Office document that suggested he was deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the 2004 New Year's Honours List because of his research on animals - research considered \\"controversial\\" by a British government committee that oversees matters of science and technology despite being widely supported by political leaders and the public.Leppard, David and Winnett, Robert. \\"Cursing mandarin in knighthood row\\".

As part of the consultation process a taskforce was convened, with Blakemore as chairman, to consider options for the size and location of the new NIMR. During the process a number of senior staff at NIMR, including the then Director, Sir John Skehel, opposed a move being proposed as the only optionSelect Committee on Science and Technology Fourth Report: 5 Campaign by NIMR, 8 February 2005 believing \\"staying at Mill Hill should be considered.\\"Hagan, Pat NIMR inquiry criticizes MRC, The Scientist, 8 February 2005 Robin Lovell-Badge, a scientist at NIMR who was a member of the taskforce, proposed this option be included in the official publication of the taskforce, something that Blakemore and the majority of other members were opposed to.Select Committee on Science and Technology Fourth Report: 4 The Task Force, 8 February 2005 After disagreeing on the issue, Lovell-Badge alleged that Blakemore had twice attempted to \\"coerce\\" him into agreement by threatening his job.

The report also criticised unnamed senior NIMR staff for an attempt at \\"undermining Blakemore's position.\\" The MRC has maintained its commitment to relocate NIMR and has entered into partnership with the Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK, University College London, Imperial College London and King's College London, to create the Francis Crick Institute on a site adjacent to the British Library and St Pancras Station in London.

She was diagnosed with epileptic psychosis (temporal lobe epilepsy) and had a history of psychiatric treatment, which was overall not effective. When Michel was 16, she experienced a seizure and was diagnosed with psychosis caused by temporal lobe epilepsy. Shortly thereafter, she was diagnosed with depression and was treated by a psychiatric hospital. By the time she was 20, she had become intolerant of various religious objects and began to hear voices. Her condition worsened despite medication, and she became suicidal, also displaying other symptoms, for which she took medication as well. After taking psychiatric medications for five years failed to improve her symptoms, Michel and her family became convinced she was possessed by a demon. As a result, her family appealed to the Catholic Church for an exorcism. While rejected at first, after much hesitation, two priests got permission from the local bishop in 1975. The priests began conducting exorcism sessions and the parents stopped consulting doctors. Anneliese Michel stopped eating food and died due to malnourishment and dehydration after 67 exorcism sessions. Michel's parents and the two Roman Catholic priests were found guilty of negligent homicide and were sentenced to six months in jail (reduced to three years of probation), as well as a fine. The 2005 film The Exorcism of Emily Rose is loosely based on her story. Early life Born as Anna Elisabeth Michel on 21 September 1952 in Leiblfing, Bavaria, West Germany, to a Roman Catholic family, Michel was brought up along with three sisters by her parents, Josef and Anna. She was religious and went to Mass twice a week. When she was sixteen, she suffered a severe convulsion and was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. In 1973, Michel graduated and joined the University of W√ºrzburg. Her classmates later described her as \\"withdrawn and very religious\\". Psychiatric treatment In June 1970, Michel suffered a third seizure at the psychiatric hospital where she had been staying. She was prescribed anti-convulsion drugs for the first time, including Dilantin, which did not alleviate the problem. She began describing seeing \\"devil faces\\" at various times of the day. That same month, she was prescribed another drug, Aolept, which is similar to chlorpromazine and is used in the treatment of various psychoses including schizophrenia, disturbed behavior and delusions. By 1973, she suffered from depression and began hallucinating while praying, and complained about hearing voices telling her that she was \\"damned\\" and would \\"rot in hell\\". Michel's treatment in a psychiatric hospital did not improve her health and her depression worsened. Long-term treatment did not help either, and she grew increasingly frustrated with the medical intervention, taking pharmacological drugs for five years. Michel became intolerant of Christian sacred places and objects, such as the crucifix. Michel went to San Damiano with a family friend who regularly organized Christian pilgrimages.Interviews in \\"Satan lebt ‚Äì Die R√ºckkehr des Exorzismus\\", 2006, wdr, Documentary by Helge Cramer. Her escort concluded that she was suffering from demonic possession because she was unable to walk past a crucifix and refused to drink the water of a Christian holy spring: Michel and her family, as well as her community, became convinced and consulted several priests, asking for an exorcism. The priests declined, recommended the continuation of medical treatment, and informed the family that exorcisms required the bishop's permission. In the Catholic Church, official approval for an exorcism is given when the person strictly meets the set criteria, then they are considered to be suffering from possession () and under demonic control. Intense dislike for religious objects and supernatural powers are some of the first indications. Michel worsened physically and displayed aggression, self-injury, drank her own urine and ate insects. In November 1973, Michel started her treatment with Tegretol, an anti-seizure drug and mood stabilizer. She was prescribed anti-psychotic drugs during the course of the religious rites and took them frequently until some time before her death. Despite taking these neuroleptic medications, Michel's symptoms worsened and she began to manifest \\"growling, seeing demons, throwing things.\\" Exorcism Bishop Josef Stangl (May 1959) who approved the exorcism ordering total secrecy The priest Ernst Alt, whom they met, on seeing her declared that \\"she didn't look like an epileptic\\" and that he did not see her having seizures. Alt believed she was suffering from demonic possession and urged the local bishop to allow an exorcism. In a letter to Alt in 1975, Michel wrote, \\"I am nothing; everything about me is vanity. What should I do? I have to improve. You pray for me\\" and also once told him, \\"I want to suffer for other people...but this is so cruel\\". In September of the same year, Bishop Josef Stangl granted the priest Arnold Renz permission to exorcise according to the Rituale Romanum of 1614, but ordered total secrecy. Renz performed the first session on 24 September. Michel began talking increasingly about \\"dying to atone for the wayward youth of the day and the apostate priests of the modern church\\", and she refused to eat towards the end. At this point, her parents stopped consulting doctors on her request and relied solely on the exorcism rites. 67 exorcism sessions; one or two each week, lasting up to four hours, were performed over about ten months in 1975‚Äì1976. Death On 1 July 1976, Michel died in her home. The autopsy report stated the cause was malnutrition and dehydration due to being in a semi-starvation state for almost a year while the rites of exorcism were performed. She weighed 30 kilograms (68 pounds), suffering broken knees due to continuous genuflections. She was unable to move without assistance, and was reported to have contracted pneumonia. Prosecution After an investigation, the state prosecutor maintained that Michel's death could have been prevented even one week before she died. In 1976, the state charged Michel's parents and priests Ernst Alt and Arnold Renz with negligent homicide. During the case Michel's body was exhumed and tapes were played to the court of the exorcisms over the eleven months which led to her death. The parents were defended by Erich Schmidt- Leichner; their lawyers were sponsored by the Church. The state recommended that no involved parties be jailed; instead, the recommended sentence for the priests was a fine, while the prosecution concluded that the parents should be exempt from punishment as they had \\"suffered enough\\", which is a criterion in German penal law, cf. ¬ß 60 StGB. =Trial= The trial started on 30 March 1978 in the district court and drew intense interest. Before the court, doctors testified that Michel was not possessed, stating that this was a psychological effect because of her strict religious upbringing and her epilepsy, but the doctor Richard Roth, who was asked for medical help by Alt, allegedly told her during the exorcism, that \\"there is no injection against the devil, Anneliese\\". Schmidt-Leichner said that the exorcism was legal and that the German constitution protected citizens in the unrestricted exercise of their religious beliefs. The defense played tapes recorded at the exorcism sessions, sometimes featuring what was claimed to be \\"demons arguing\\", to assert their claim that Michel was possessed. Both priests said the demons identified themselves as Lucifer, Cain, Judas Iscariot, Belial, Legion, and Nero among others; they further said that she was finally freed because of the exorcism just before her death. The bishop said that he was not aware of her alarming health condition when he approved of the exorcism and did not testify. The accused were found guilty of manslaughter resulting from negligence and were sentenced to six months in jail (which was later suspended) and three years of probation. It was a far lighter sentence than anticipated, but it was more than requested by the prosecution, who had asked that the priests only be fined and that the parents be found guilty but not punished. The Church approving such an old fashioned exorcism rite drew public and media attention. According to John M. Duffey, the case was a misidentification of mental illness. Exhumation and aftermath Michel's gravestone. Her grave became a place of pilgrimage. After the trial, the parents asked the authorities for permission to exhume the remains of their daughter. The official reason presented by the parents to authorities was that Michel had been buried in undue hurry in a cheap coffin. Almost two years after the burial, on 25 February 1978, her remains were replaced in a new oak coffin lined with tin. The official reports state that the body bore the signs of consistent deterioration. The accused exorcists were discouraged from seeing the remains of Michel. Arnold Renz later stated that he had been prevented from entering the mortuary. Her grave became and remains a pilgrimage site. The number of officially sanctioned exorcisms decreased in Germany due to this case, in spite of Pope Benedict XVI's support for wider use of it compared to Pope John Paul II, who in 1999 made the rules stricter, involving only rare cases. On 6 June 2013, a fire broke out in the house where Anneliese Michel lived, and, although the local police said it was a case of arson, some locals attributed it to the exorcism case.

Self-taught to read and write, he had been granted the right to practice law throughout the country, represented Bahia in the Chamber of Deputies on a range of legislatures, was secretary of the Provincial Governorship of Sergipe, advisor to the emperor, and had received the title of Knight of the Imperial Order of the Southern Cross in 1823. Rebou√ßas became famous in Rio de Janeiro, at the time capital of the Empire of Brazil, solving the trouble of water supply, bringing it from fountain-heads outside the town. Serving as a military engineer during the Paraguayan War in Paraguay, Rebou√ßas successfully developed a torpedo. He supposedly committed suicide. References *Gaspar, L√∫cia. Andr√© Rebou√ßas.

He was the disciple and successor of Epicurus as head of the school. None of his writings survive. He wrote works directed against Plato, Aristotle, and Empedocles. A fragment from his Against Empedocles, preserved by Porphyry, discusses the need for law in society. His views on the nature of the gods are quoted by Philodemus. Life Hermarchus was a son of Agemarchus, a poor man of Mytilene (in insular Greece), and was at first brought up as a rhetorician, but afterwards became a faithful disciple of Epicurus, who left to him his garden, and appointed him his successor as the head of his school, about 270 BC. He died in the house of Lysias at an advanced age, and left behind him the reputation of a great philosopher. Cicero has preserved a letter of Epicurus addressed to him.Cicero, De Finibus, ii. 30 Diogenes La√´rtius mentioned from a letter written by Epicurus, \\"All my books to be given to Hermarchus. And if anything should happen to Hermarchus before the children of Metrodorus grow up, Amynomachus and Timocrates shall give from the funds bequeathed by me, so far as possible, enough for their several needs, as long as they are well ordered. And let them provide for the rest according to my arrangements; that everything may be carried out, so far as it lies in their power.\\" Writings Hermarchus was the author of several works, which are characterised by Diogenes La√´rtius as \\"excellent\\" (): *Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºòŒºœÄŒµŒ¥oŒ∫ŒªŒ≠Œ± - Against Empedocles (in 22 books) *Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ - On the mathematicians *Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ Œ†ŒªŒ¨œÑœâŒΩŒ± - Against Plato *Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑoœÑŒ≠ŒªŒ∑ŒΩ - Against Aristotle All of these works are lost, and we know nothing about them but their titles.A small papyrus fragment showing the title of his \\"Against Empedocles\\", was actually found at Oxyrhynchus, POxy 3318 But from an expression of Cicero,Cicero, De Natura Deorum, i. 33 we may infer that his works were of a polemical nature, and directed against the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, and on Empedocles.Cicero, Academica, ii. 30; Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, xiii. 53; Photius, Bibliotheca, 167. A long fragment (quotation or paraphrase) from an unspecified work of Hermarchus' has been preserved by Porphyry.Porphyry, De Abstinentia i. 7-12; 26 This fragment is probably from his Against Empedocles.Catherine Osborne, (2007), Dumb Beasts and Dead Philosophers: Humanity and the Humane in Ancient Philosophy and Literature, page 202. Oxford University Press. In this fragment, Hermarchus discusses the reasons for punishment for murder. He argues that early law- makers were guided by the principle that murder was not good for society, and were able to educate other people that this was a rational principle. They then created punishments for those people who could not be educated. For everyone who understood that murder was not useful, laws would not be needed; punishments are only needed for those who fail to understand this. For Hermarchus, this was an example of social progress and an increase in rationality.A. A. Long, (2006), From Epicurus to Epictetus: Studies in Hellenistic and Roman Philosophy, pages 196-7. Oxford University Press. Philodemus in his On the Way of Life of the Gods,PHerc 152/7 quotes the view of Hermarchus that the gods breathe, because the gods are living beings and all living things breathe.Keimpe Algra, (1999), The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy, page 456. Cambridge University Press Philodemus goes on to say that, according to Hermarchus, the gods must talk to one another, because conversation is conducive to happiness: > And one must say that they use speech and converse with one another; for, he > [Hermarchus] says, we would not consider them more fortunate and > indestructible if they did not, but rather similar to mute human beings. For > since in fact all of us who are not maimed make use of language, to say that > the gods either are maimed or do not resemble us in this respect (there > being no other way either they or we could give shape to utterances) is > extremely foolish, especially since conversation with those like themselves > is a source of indescribable pleasure to the good.Philodemus quoted in > Michael Wigodsky, Emotions and Immortality in Philodemus \\"On the Gods\\" and > the \\"Aeneid\\". in David Armstrong, Vergil, Philodemus, and the Augustans, > page 219.

Woodcock won the European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League) in 1979 with Nottingham Forest. Club career =Early career= Born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, Woodcock had trained with Alan and Steve Buckley as a child, coached by their father, and had played for Priory Celtic. He started his career at Nottingham Forest, signing a contract in January 1974. After loan spells at Lincoln City and Doncaster Rovers, Woodcock broke into the Forest first team in 1976‚Äì77, helping the team to promotion to the First Division. Woodcock would later credit the Lincoln move and the leadership of Graham Taylor as being instrumental to his development. Under Brian Clough, Forest went on to win the First Division title and Football League Cup in 1978 with Woodcock winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award that year as well, and the European Cup in 1979. He also scored in Forest's victory over Southampton in the 1979 Football League Cup Final. =Move to the Bundesliga= Woodcock was signed by West German side FC K√∂ln for a fee of ¬£600,000 (), in time for the 1979‚Äì80 season. He spent three seasons there. He scored 28 goals in 81 matches for the Cologne club. =Arsenal= He returned home after the 1982 World Cup, signing for Terry Neill's Arsenal for ¬£500,000. Woodcock was Arsenal's top scorer for the next three seasons, his best tally being 21 in 1983‚Äì84; he hit five in a single game against Aston Villa, a post-war record for the club, he also scored the final goal in the last ever British Home Championship. He helped Arsenal reach the semi-finals of both domestic cups in his first season, and remained in favour with new manager Don Howe, who was appointed in December 1983 following the dismissal of Terry Neill after a dismal first half of the season. He also contributed to a strong start to the 1984‚Äì85 season for the Gunners, which saw them top the league in the autumn of 1984. However, he suffered a serious injury in March 1985, which disrupted his career. With the arrival of George Graham as Arsenal manager in May 1986, the 30-year-old Woodcock was told he was surplus to requirements. In all, Woodcock scored 68 goals in 169 matches for the Gunners. =Return to Germany= Woodcock then returned to 1. FC K√∂ln for a fee of \\"about ¬£200,000\\". During his second spell there, he made 49 appearances and scored 11 goals. He finished his career playing for Fortuna K√∂ln, making 37 appearances and scoring 5 goals, before retiring from playing in 1990. International career =England U21= Woodcock made two appearances for the England U21s, scoring five goals; two of which came against Italy U21. =Senior side= Woodcock was first called up to the full England squad for the match against Hungary. He made his d√©but for England in 1978 against Northern Ireland. He would go on to win 42 caps for his country (scoring 16 goals), and play in the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He also played in the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers but was left out of the final squad.

It is derived from the words grƒÅma ‚Äúvillage‚Äù and devatƒÅ ‚Äúdeity‚Äù. Most grƒÅmadevatƒÅs are village deities who are worshipped solely by inhabitants of their village. Principal Hindu deities such as Shiva and incarnations of Vishnu are also worshipped alongside the grƒÅmadevatƒÅs. They are often worshipped in aniconic forms of the earthenware pots or stones. Although grƒÅmadevatƒÅs are most often goddesses, there are a few notable male exceptions. Dharma-Thakkur is a god of fertility and disease in West Bengal state of India. Another example is found in Kal Bhairav, a fierce form of Lord Shiva is the grƒÅmadevatƒÅ in the rural villages of Maharashtra, where he is referred to as Vairavar. Most Gramadevatas are believed to originate from the pre-Vedic beliefs of indigenous inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent. The worship patterns vary according to region but most do not rely on the Vedas and employ non-Brahmins as priests. Unlike Brahminical deities, these village deities will not usually have large temples but have open spaces. A common pattern, especially in South India, is to have a village goddess (a fertility figure) and a guardian and protector of the village at the village boundary.  Origins  Possible fertility goddess, Late Harappan The earliest appearance of the \\"Mother Goddess\\" found in South Asia is in Mehrgarh in the form of female terracotta figurines dating to the 4th millennium BCE. These figurines are believed to represent the \\"Mother Goddess.\\" Similar female figurines are found in 3rd-2nd millennium figures from Harappan civilization sites, including a woman with a plant emerging from her womb and a woman in a tree (believed to be a goddess) being worshipped by another woman, with seven figures below. Due to their association with agriculture, the idea of the earth spirit of bhumi is still a common association with villages today just as it was in Harappan times. Evidence of continued veneration of a female village deity comes from a terracotta fragment Chandraketugarh from what is now eastern West Bengal dating to the 1st century BCE. The plaque shows a figure holding a parasol, evidently a goddess, being worshipped with earthen pots, fruits, flowers and other offerings similar to those given to modern-day village goddesses. Another group of common iconography related to gramadevatas are the sapta matrika, the \\"seven mothers.\\" The first mention of these goddesses occurs in the later layers of the Mahabharata dating to the 1st century CE, and their lack of mention in the Vedas indicates a non-Vedic origin for these goddesses. In addition to the fertility goddesses, the various disease goddesses include deities described with unappealing physical characteristics like Mariamman and Mata. These goddesses could be represented in the Harappan period by a goddess with weapons in her hair. Similarly violent goddesses absorbed into Puranic Hinduism, like Durga, appear around the 1st century BCE-1st century CE.

History =Zaire (1967‚Äì1993)= The Zaire (), symbol: \\"Z\\", or sometimes \\"∆µ\\", was introduced in 1967, replacing the Congolese franc at an exchange rate of 1 zaire = 1000 francs. The zaire was subdivided into 100 makuta (singular: likuta, symbol: \\"K\\"), each of 100 sengi (symbol: \\"s\\"). However, the sengi was worth very little and the only sengi denominated coin was the 10 sengi coin issued in 1967. Unusually for any currency, it was common practice to write cash amounts with three zeros after the decimal place, even after inflation had greatly devalued the currency. Inflation eventually caused denominations of banknotes up to 5,000,000 zaires to be issued, after which the new zaire was introduced.

In 1973, the first coins issued by the Bank of Zaire were issued, cupro-nickel 5, 10 and 20 makuta. In 1987, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of brass 1, 5 and with a 10 zaires in 1988.

In 1972, the Bank of Zaire started issuing notes for 1, 5 and 10 zaires, followed by 50 makuta notes in 1973. 50 za√Øre notes were introduced in 1980, followed by 100 zaires in 1983, 500 zaires in 1984, 1000 zaires in 1985, 5000 zaires in 1988, 10,000 zaires in 1989, 2000, 20,000 and 50,000 zaires in 1991 and, finally, 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 in 1992. The 5,000,000 zaire note, which entered circulation in late 1992, was not accepted as legal tender for several weeks in some parts of the country (notably in the north-east), and in other parts of the country it was accepted for only part of its value.

The texture is called granophyric. The texture can be similar to micrographic texture and to the coarser graphic intergrowths of quartz and alkali feldspar common in pegmatite. These textures document simultaneous crystallization of quartz and feldspar from a silicate melt at the eutectic point, perhaps in the presence of a water-rich phase. They may also be formed by crystallization when the magma is significantly undercooled, not necessarily under eutectic conditions. Granophyres typically are intrusive rocks that crystallized at shallow depths, and many have compositions similar to those of granites. A common occurrence of granophyre is within layered igneous intrusions dominated by rocks with compositions like that of gabbro. In such occurrences, the granophyre may form as an end product of fractional crystallization of a parent mafic magma, or by melting of rocks into which the mafic magma was emplaced, or by a combination of the two processes. Granophyre may also form as the uppermost stratigraphic layer resulting from melting of upper-middle crustal rocks by a meteorite impact. For example, the upper layer of the Main Mass of the 1850 Ma Sudbury Structure is composed of fine-medium grained granitic rocks with abundant granophyric textures.

She transferred to the Administrative Service in October 1977. Between February 1991 and April 1994, she served as Deputy Secretary for the Civil Service. Between April and November 1994, she was Deputy Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands. In November 1994, she was promoted to Senior Assistant Director and later Deputy Director, Housing Department. Law headed the Chief Executive's Office from January to July 1997; and was made Commissioner for Transport in August 1997. She was made Director of Education in November 1998, and secretary for education and manpower in 2000. The post became Permanent Secretary in 2002, because of former Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa's ministerial reforms. During the 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests, National Public Radio reported, \\"Appearing on a local radio program, Fanny Law and Ip Kwok-him, who advise the Beijing-appointed government in Hong Kong, each offered qualified apologies for the bill. 'I'm willing [to say sorry] as I really thought at the time 99.9% of Hongkongers would not be affected by the bill,' Law said, according to The South China Morning Post.\\" = Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower = During her term of service, Law was responsible for large-scale reforms in education, Law was often criticized by educators who thought her ideas were out of touch with realities on the ground. Some of her public speeches also provoked controversies; teaching union representatives called for her resignation on several occasions. In early January 2006, two teachers committed suicide, three other teachers' suicides in 2005 were blamed on job-related stress. Law rejected causal connections between the deaths by suicide of two teachers due to education reforms, saying: \\"If the prime reason [for the deaths] is education reforms, why have there been only two teachers who have committed suicide?\\" Her comments caused a furore among teachers and the public. She apologised on 10 January for her \\"inappropriate\\" remarks about the suicide of the two teachers. 7,500 ‚Äì 15,000 teachers held a protest on 22 January against Law and the educational reforms. Raymond H.C. Wong was appointed to replace her. = Commissioner, ICAC = Law resigned from her post at 20 June 2007 after the HKIEd probe accused her of interfering with academic freedom. However, the Court of First Instance held that Law did not violate the institute's right to academic freedom. The judicial review was allowed to take place on 13 March 2009. = Tung Wah Group of Hospitals = In December 2008, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals announced Law's appointment as Chief Executive. She declined the post in February 2009, after the government barred her from working in education-related work until 2011. There are fears over potential conflicts of interest: this decision was linked to the public consultation on post-service employment of civil servants following the row over Leung Chin-man's appointment to a local property developer.

The phrase is used both for the physical seal itself, which is kept by the secretary of state, and more generally for the design impressed upon it. The Great Seal was designed by Robert Wells of Jefferson City. Blazon: Per pale and to the dexter per fess, Azure a decrescent Argent, Gules a Bear passant facing to the sinister Argent, Argent a representation of the Coat of Arms of the United States proper.  Design  The Seal as it appeared in 1879 The center of the seal contains the Great Seal of the United States on the right side, and, on the left, symbols representing the state. On both sides of the center circle, a bear, native to Missouri, represents strength and bravery; a crescent moon, a symbol of the Virgin Mary and a nod to the French who first settled Missouri, represents the newness of statehood and the potential for growth. Surrounding these symbols is the motto \\"United we stand, divided we fall\\". The belt buckle signifies the State's ability to secede from the Union if deemed necessary, i.e., the belt can be unbuckled. Two mighty bears, representing Missouri's native bears, support this center shield. A scroll carries the state motto, Salus populi suprema lex esto, a Latin phrase meaning \\"Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law.\\" The year 1820 is inscribed in Roman numerals below the scroll, although Missouri was not officially granted statehood until 1821. A star representing each of the other states of the Union (Missouri became the 24th) graces the top portion of the seal. The outer circle of the seal bears the words \\"The Great Seal of the State of Missouri\\". Above the shield is a helmet representing Missouri's state sovereignty. The large star above the helmet surrounded by 23 smaller stars represents Missouri's status as the 24th state. The cloud around the stars indicates the problems Missouri had in becoming a state. Salus populi suprema lex esto (Latin \\"Let the good of the people be the supreme law\\" or \\"The welfare of the people shall be the supreme law\\") is found in Cicero's De Legibus (book III, part III, sub. VIII), as Ollis salus populi suprema lex esto. Free full text from the Latin Library. Retrieved on 2007-06-08. The phrase is the state motto of Missouri, accepted in its state seal. It is also the motto, and appears on the coat of arms, of the City of Salford, the London Borough of Lewisham, the Duquesne University School of Law, and is used as the motto of the Vlaams Belang political group in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. John Locke uses it as the epigraph in his Second Treatise on Government and refers to it as a fundamental rule for government.  History  Robert Wells, of Jefferson City, designed the seal.

Although not proficient on any instrument, he can play the guitar, the harmonica, the saxophone and the piano. Fer√≥ Nagy at Tab√°n Career Fer√≥ studied at the Polytechnic and earned a degree in engineering. He began singing in rock bands as a hobby in the 1960s. He became famous as the singer, frontman and songwriter of the band Beatrice in the late 1970s. He created a \\"phenomenon\\" with his stage style, doing long comical and/or aggressive monologues and performances calling himself \\"A Nemzet cs√≥t√°nya\\" (translated as roach of the nation\\") and being an outspoken anti- Socialist. After leaving Beatrice, he formed another band called Bikini in 1982, then returned to Beatrice in 1987 to date. He tours with the band and releases materials with the group, although he has also released solo albums and an anthology. Fer√≥ worked as an actor in a number of films and theatrical plays. On stage he played a part in the rock opera Istv√°n a kir√°ly and took part in the rock version of \\"Hamlet\\". He also played the part of Berger in the musical Hair. Among his movie roles are C√©ll√∂v√∂lde (1989) in which he starred as a detective, Argo (2004) in which he played role of Pro and Pappa Pia (2017). Fer√≥ was also the Hungarian voice of Andrew Dice Clay in The Adventures of Ford Fairlane.

History  The Center for Inquiry was established in 1991 by atheist philosopher and author Paul Kurtz. It brought together two organizations: the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (founded by Kurtz in 1976) and the Council for Secular Humanism (founded by Kurtz in 1980). In January 2016, CFI announced that it was merging with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. In June 2009, Kurtz left CFI over a conflict with then-CEO Ronald A. Lindsay.  Committee for Skeptical Inquiry  Joe Nickell, Research Fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, in office. Amherst, NY 2013 Through the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), and its journal, Skeptical Inquirer magazine, published by the Center for Inquiry, CSI examines evidential claims of the paranormal or supernormal, including psychics, ghosts, telepathy, clairvoyance, UFOs, and creationism. They also examine pseudoscientific claims involving vaccines, cellphones, power lines, GMOs, and alternative medicine. In the area of religion, they examine beliefs that involve testable claims, such as faith healing and creationism, but stay away from untestable religious beliefs such as the existence of God. The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), then known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), was, alongside magician and prominent skeptic James Randi, sued by TV celebrity Uri Geller in the 1990s after Randi told a newspaper interviewer that that Geller's tricks \\"are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes when I was a kid.\\" The case ran for several years, and was ultimately settled in 1995 with Geller ordered to pay the legal costs of Randi and CSICOP. = The Independent Investigations Group = IIG \\"Power Balance\\" testing exercise The Independent Investigations Group, a volunteer group based at CFI Los Angeles, undertakes experimental testing of fringe claims. It offers a cash prize ( this has a value of US$250,000) for successful demonstration of supernatural effects. The IIG Awards (known as \\"Iggies\\") are presented for \\"scientific and critical thinking in mainstream entertainment\\". IIG has investigated, amongst other things, power bracelets, psychic detectives and a 'telepathic wonder dog'.  Religion, ethics, and society  Logo of the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH). The Center promotes critical inquiry into the foundations and social effects of the world religions. Since 1983, initially through its connection with Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, it has focused on such issues as fundamentalism in Christianity and Islam, humanistic alternatives to religious ethics, and religious sources of political violence. It has taken part in protests against religious persecution around the world and opposes religious privilege, for example benefits for clergy in the US Tax Code. In 2014 and 2017, respectively, the CFI won two lawsuits compelling the states of Illinois and Indiana to allow weddings to be performed by officiants who are neither religious clergy nor government officials. A similar lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of marriage law in Texas was dismissed in August 2019. CFI actively supports secular interests, such as secular state education. It organizes conferences, such as Women In Secularism and a conference focused on freethought advocate Robert Ingersoll. CFI has provided meeting and conference facilities to other skeptical organizations, for example an atheist of color conference on social justice. CFI also undertakes atheist education and support activities, for example sending freethought books to prisoners as part of its Freethought Books Project. CFI is active in advocating free speech, and in promoting secular government. It speaks against institutional religion in the armed forces. Free Inquiry is published by the Center for Inquiry, in association with the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH).  Publications  Tom Flynn, editor of Free Inquiry, gives a presentation on the Freethought Trail The results of research and activities supported by the Center and its affiliates are published and distributed to the public in seventeen separate national and international magazines, journals, and newsletters. Among them are CSH's Free Inquiry and Secular Humanist Bulletin, and CSI's Skeptical Inquirer, CFI's American Rationalist.The American Rationalist volume LVII May/June 2011, Number 3, . The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice and Philo, a journal covering philosophical issues, are no longer being published. CFI has produced the weekly radio show and podcast, Point of Inquiry since 2005. Episodes are available free for download from iTunes. Its current hosts, , are Leighann Lord and James Underdown. Notable guests have included Steven Pinker, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins.  Projects and programs  = Secular Rescue = The Center for Inquiry has an emergency fund called Secular Rescue, formerly known as the Freethought Emergency Fund. Between 2015 and 2018, Secular Rescue, helped thirty individuals fleeing anti-secular regimes gain asylum. = Office of Public Policy = The Office of Public Policy (OPP) is the Washington D.C. political arm of the Center for Inquiry. The OPP's mandate is to lobby Congress and the Administration on issues related to science and secularism. This includes defending the separation of church and state, promoting science and reason as the basis of public policy, and advancing secular values. The OPP publishes position statements on its subjects of interest. Examples have included acupuncture, climate change, contraception and intelligent design. The Office is an active participant in legal matters, providing experts for Congress testimony and amicus briefs in Supreme Court cases. It publishes a list of bills it considers of interest as they pass through the U.S. legislative process. = \\"Science and the Public\\" Master of Education program = In partnership with the Graduate School of Education at the State University of New York at Buffalo, CFI offers an accredited Master of Education program in Science and the Public, available entirely online. Aimed at students preparing for careers in research, science education, public policy, science journalism, or further study in sociology, history and philosophy of science, science communication, education, or public administration, the program explores the methods and outlook of science as they intersect with public culture, scientific literacy, and public policy. = Quackwatch = In February 2020, Quackwatch, founded by Dr. Stephen Barrett, became part of CFI which announced it plans to maintain its various websites and to receive Barrett's library later in the year. Richard Dawkins Award The Richard Dawkins Award is an annual award that was presented by the Atheist Alliance of America up until July 2019 when it moved to the Center for Inquiry (CFI). According to the CFI press release \\"The recipient will be a distinguished individual from the worlds of science, scholarship, education or entertainment, who publicly proclaims the values of secularism and rationalism, upholding scientific truth wherever it may lead\\". The award has been presented since 2003, and is named after Richard Dawkins, an English evolutionary biologist who was named the world's top thinker in a 2013 reader's poll of the Prospect Magazine. Past projects and programs The following projects and programs are no longer active. = Camp Inquiry = The Center for Inquiry organized an annual summer camp for children called Camp Inquiry, focusing on scientific literacy, critical thinking, naturalism, the arts, humanities, and humanist ethical development. Camp Inquiry has been described as \\"a summer camp for kids with questions\\" where spooky stories were followed by \\"reverse engineering sessions\\" as the participants were encouraged to determine the cause of an apparently supernatural experience. Camp Inquiry has been criticised as \\"Jesus Camp in reverse\\"; its organisers countered that the camp is not exclusive to atheist children and that campers are encouraged to draw their own conclusions based on empirical and critical thinking. = CFI Institute = The Center for Inquiry Institute offered undergraduate level online courses, seminars, and workshops in critical thinking and the scientific outlook and its implications for religion, human values, and the borderlands of science. In addition to transferable undergraduate credit through the University at Buffalo system, CFI offered a thirty credit-hour Certificate of Proficiency in Critical Inquiry. The three-year curriculum plan offered summer sessions at the main campus at the University at Buffalo in Amherst. = Medicine and health = The Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health (CSMMH) stimulated critical scientific scrutiny of New Age medicine and the schools of psychotherapy. It supported naturalistic addiction recovery practices through Secular Organizations for Sobriety. CFI challenges the claims of alternative medicine and advocates a scientific basis for healthcare. CSMMH papers have covered topics such as pseudoscience in autism treatments Professional organizations which issued position statements indicating that facilitated communication is not a scientifically valid technique; Most effective intervention for autism according to scientists; Symptoms of autism; Reason for the abundance of untested and ineffective therapies for autism and in psychiatry.\\"Power Therapies and possible threats to the science of psychology and psychiatry\\". By: Devilly, Grant J. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. Jun 2005, Vol. 39 Issue 6, pp. 437‚Äì445. 9p. This paper reviews a collection of new therapies collectively self-termed ‚ÄòThe Power Therapies‚Äô, outlining their proposed procedures and the evidence for and against their use. These therapies are then put to the test for pseudoscientific practice. It is concluded that these new therapies have offered no new scientifically valid theories of action, show only non-specific efficacy, show no evidence that they offer substantive improvements to extant psychiatric care, yet display many characteristics consistent with pseudoscience. = Naturalism Research Project = CFI also ran the Naturalism Research Project, a major effort to develop the theoretical and practical applications of philosophical naturalism. As part of this project, CFI's libraries, research facilities, and conference areas were available to scientists and scholars to advance the understanding of science's methodologies and conclusions about naturalism. Activities of the Naturalism Research Project included lectures and seminars by visiting fellows and scholars; academic conferences; and support CFI publications of important research. Among the central issues of naturalism include the exploration of varieties of naturalism; problems in philosophy of science; the methodologies of scientific inquiry; naturalism and humanism; naturalistic ethics; planetary ethics; and naturalism and the biosciences. CFI organization and locations CFI's Rare Book Room, located at their Amherst, NY Headquarters CFI is a nonprofit body registered as a charity in the United States. It has 17 locations in the U.S., and has 16 international branches or affiliated organizations. The organization has Centers For Inquiry in Amherst, New York (its headquarters), Los Angeles, New York City, Tampa Bay, Washington, D.C., Indiana, Austin, Chicago, San Francisco and Michigan. =International activities= CFI has branches, representation or affiliated organizations in countries around the world. It organizes its international activities under the banner Center For Inquiry Transnational. In addition, CFI holds consultative status to the United Nations as an NGO under the UN Economic and Social Council. The Center participates in UN Human Rights Council debates, for example a debate on the subject of female genital mutilation during 2014. =University exchange programs= CFI Moscow operates an exchange program where Russian students and scholars are able to visit CFI headquarters in Amherst and participate in a summer institute each year. Additional international programs exist in Germany (Rossdorf), France (Nice), Spain (Bilbao), Poland (Warsaw), Nigeria (Ibadan), Uganda (Kampala), Kenya (Nairobi), Nepal (Kathmandu), India (Pune) (Hyderabad), Egypt (Cairo), China (Beijing), New Zealand (Auckland), Peru (Lima), Argentina (Buenos Aires), Senegal (Dakar), Zambia (Lusaka), and Bangladesh (Dacca). =Centre for Inquiry Canada= CFI Canada (CFIC) is the Canadian branch of CFI Transnational, headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Justin Trottier served as National Executive Director from 2007‚Äì2011. Originally established and supported in part by CFI Transnational, CFI Canada has become an independent Canadian national organization with several provincial branches. CFI Canada has branches in Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Saskatoon, Calgary, Okanagan (Kelowna) and Vancouver.  Affiliate organizations  * Centre for Inquiry Canada * Centre for Inquiry UKCFI UK is a section of the British Humanist Association * Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) * Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion (CSER) * Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health Practice (CSMMH) * Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society * International Academy of Humanism * Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science  In the media  CFI participates in media debates on science, health, religion and its other areas of interest. Its \\"Keep Healthcare Safe and Secular\\" campaign promotes scientifically sound healthcare. It has been an outspoken critic of dubious and unscientific healthcare practices, and engages in public debate on the merit and legality of controversial medical techniques. In 2014, CEO Ron Lindsay publicly criticized Stanislaw Burzynski's controversial Texas cancer clinic. CFI campaigns for a secular society, for example in opposing the addition of prayer text on public property. The Center supports secular and free speech initiatives. On November 14, 2006, the CFI opened its Office of Public Policy in Washington, DC and issued a declaration \\"In Defense of Science and Secularism\\", which calls for public policy to be based on science rather than faith. The next day The Washington Post ran an article about it entitled \\"Think Tank Will Promote Thinking\\". In 2011, video expert James Underdown of IIG and CFI Los Angeles did an experiment for \\"Miracle Detective\\" Oprah Winfrey Network which replicated exactly the angelic apparition that people claim cured a 14-year-old severely disabled child at Presbyterian Hemby Children's Hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. The \\"angel\\" was sunlight from a hidden window, and the girl remained handicapped. = Consumer fraud lawsuits against CVS and Walmart = In July 2018, CFI filed suit against CVS in the District of Columbia for consumer fraud over its sale and marketing of ineffective homeopathic medicine. The lawsuit in part accuses the country's largest drug retailer of deceiving consumers through its misrepresentation of homeopathy's safety and effectiveness, wasting customers‚Äô money and putting their health at risk. Nicholas Little, CFI's Vice President and General Counsel said, \\"CVS is taking cynical advantage of their customers‚Äô confusion and trust in the CVS brand, and putting their health at risk to make a profit and they can't claim ignorance. If the people in charge of the country's largest pharmacy don't know that homeopathy is bunk, they should be kept as far away from the American healthcare system as possible.\\" , the lawsuit is still in negotiations. In May 2019, CFI announced that they have filed a similar suit against Walmart for their range of homeopathic products. In an August, 2019 interview, Little commented that \\"The problem is the government agencies (the FDA and FTC) aren't doing their job. ... The FDA and FTC have rules and guidelines, but they don't enforce them.\\" In July 2019, CFI announced that the Stiefel Freethought Foundation was contributing an additional $150,000 to the previously committed $100,000 to support the two lawsuits. Sikivu Hutchinson speaking at the Center for Inquiry, Washington, DC. in 2010. = Lack of racial diversity on its board of directors = In 2016, the atheist Sikivu Hutchinson criticized the merger of the secular organizations Center for Inquiry and the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, which gave Richard Dawkins a seat on the board of directors of the Center for Inquiry. Her criticism was that both organizations had all white board of directors.#AtheismSoWhite: Atheists of Color Rock Social Justice by Sikivu Hutchinson, Huffington Post, January 26, 2016 = Wyndgate Country Club and Richard Dawkins, 2011 = During Richard Dawkins' October 2011 book tour, Center for Inquiry ‚Äì the tour's sponsor ‚Äì signed a contract with Wyndgate Country Club in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as the venue site. After seeing an interview with Dawkins on The O'Reilly Factor, an official at the club cancelled Dawkins' appearance. Dawkins said that the country club official accepted Bill O'Reilly's \\"twisted\\" interpretation of his book The Magic of Reality without having read it personally. Sean Faircloth said that cancelling the reading \\"really violates the basic principles of America ... The Civil Rights Act ... prohibits discrimination based on race or religious viewpoint. ... [Dawkins has] published numerous books ... to explain science to the public, so it's rather an affront, to reason in general, to shun him as they did.\\" CFI Michigan executive director Jeff Seaver stated that \\"This action by The Wyndgate illustrates the kind of bias and bigotry that nonbelievers encounter all the time.\\" Following the cancellation, protests and legal action by CFI against the Wyndgate Country Club were pursued. In 2013 this case was settled in favor of the Center For Inquiry. = CSH actions against faith-based initiatives = In 2007, CSH sued the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) to block the use of state funds in contracts to faith- based programs for released inmates, claiming that this use is prohibited under the \\"No Aid\\" provision or Blaine amendment of the Florida constitution. The initial decision found in favor of the DOC but, on appeal, the case was remanded in 2010 on just the issue of the unconstitutionality of appropriating state funds for this purpose. While this case was in progress, after the appellate finding, Republican legislators began an effort to amend the Florida constitution to remove the language of the Blaine amendment, succeeding in 2011 to place the measure on the 2012 ballot as amendment 8. The ballot measure failed. In 2015, CHS (now CFI) and the state (along with its co- defendants) both filed for summary judgement. The court granted the state's motion in January, 2016, allowing the contested contracting practice to continue. After consideration, CFI announced in February, 2016, that it would not appeal. =Heckled at the UN= CFI representative Josephine Macintoshhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CakI_sn30xg was repeatedly interrupted and heckled whilst presenting the Center's position on censorship at the UN Human Rights Council. CFI advocated free speech, and opposed the punishment by Saudi authorities of Raif Badawi for running an Internet forum, whom they accused of atheism and liberalism. The Saudi delegation objected repeatedly to CFI's statement. CFI drew support from American, Canadian, Irish and French delegates. =Blasphemy Day= Blasphemy Rights Day International encourages individuals and groups to openly express their criticism of or outright contempt for religion. It was founded in 2009 by the Center for Inquiry. A student contacted the Center for Inquiry in Amherst, New York to present the idea, which CFI then supported. Ronald Lindsay, president and CEO of the Center for Inquiry said regarding Blasphemy Day, \\"We think religious beliefs should be subject to examination and criticism just as political beliefs are, but we have a taboo on religion\\", in an interview with CNN. It takes place every September 30 to coincide with the anniversary of the publications of the controversial Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Blasphemy Day and CFI's related Blasphemy Contests started (in CFI's own words) \\"a firestorm of controversy\\". The use of confrontational free speech has been a topic of debate within the Humanist movement and cited as an example of a wider move towards New Atheism and away from the more conciliatory approach historically associated with Humanism.

This property may pertain to the spin, hence to the magnetic moment, of conduction electrons in ferromagnetic metals, such as iron, giving rise to spin-polarized currents. It may refer to (static) spin waves, preferential correlation of spin orientation with ordered lattices (semiconductors or insulators). It may also pertain to beams of particles, produced for particular aims, such as polarized neutron scattering or muon spin spectroscopy. Spin polarization of electrons or of nuclei, often called simply magnetization, is also produced by the application of a magnetic field. Curie law is used to produce an induction signal in Electron spin resonance (ESR or EPR) and in Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Spin polarization is also important for spintronics, a branch of electronics. Magnetic semiconductors are being researched as possible spintronic materials. The spin of free electrons is measured either by a LEED image from a clean wolfram-crystal (SPLEED) or by an electron microscope composed purely of electrostatic lenses and a gold foil as a sample. Back scattered electrons are decelerated by annular optics and focused onto a ring shaped electron multiplier at about 15¬∞. The position on the ring is recorded. This whole device is called a Mott-detector. Depending on their spin the electrons have the chance to hit the ring at different positions. 1% of the electrons are scattered in the foil. Of these 1% are collected by the detector and then about 30% of the electrons hit the detector at the wrong position. Both devices work due to spin orbit coupling. The circular polarization of electromagnetic fields is due to spin polarization of their constituent photons. In the most generic context, spin polarization is any alignment of the components of a non-scalar (vectorial, tensorial, spinor) field with its arguments, i.e., with the nonrelativistic three spatial or relativistic four spatiotemporal regions over which it is defined. In this sense, it also includes gravitational waves and any field theory that couples its constituents with the differential operators of vector analysis.

Biography Born in Cambridge, Barry Pain was educated at Sedbergh School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He became a prominent contributor to The Granta. He was known as a writer of parody and lightly humorous stories. In 1889, Cornhill Magazine's editor, James Payn, published his story \\"The Hundred Gates\\", and shortly afterwards Pain became a contributor to Punch and The Speaker, and joined the staffs of the Daily Chronicle and Black and White. Pain supposedly \\"owes his discovery to Robert Louis Stevenson, who compares him to De Maupassant\\". From 1896 to 1928 he was a regular contributor to the Windsor Magazine. He died in Bushey, in Hertfordshire and is buried in Bushey churchyard. Pain's works include : * In a Canadian Canoe (1891), papers reprinted from The Granta; * Playthings and Parodies (1892); * Stories And Interludes (1892); * Graeme And Cyril (1893), published as 'Two' in United States; * The Kindness of the Celestial (1894); * The Octave of Claudius (1897); * The Romantic History of Robin Hood (1898); * Wilmay and Other Stories of Women (1898); * Eliza (1900); * Another English Woman's Love Letters (1901); * Stories in the Dark (1901); * De Omnibus, by the Conductor (1901); * Nothing Serious (1901); * The One Before (1902); * Eliza's Husband (1903); * Little Entertainments (1903); * Three Fantasies (1904); * Curiosities (1904); * Deals (1904); * Lindley Kays (1904); * The Memoirs of Constantine Dix (1905); * Robinson Crusoe's Return (1906); * Wilhelmina in London (1906); * The Shadow of the Unseen with James Blyth (1907); * The Diary of a Baby (1907); * The Luck of Norman Dale with James Blyth (1908); * First Lessons in Story-writing (1908); * Proofs Before Pulping (1909); * The Gifted Family (1909); * The Exiles of Faloo (1910); * An Exchange of Souls'An Exchange of Souls (1911); * Stories in Grey (1911); * Here And Hereafter (1911); * Eliza Getting On (1911); * Stories Without Tears (1912); * Exit Eliza (1912); * Mr. Malding's Progress promotional story/booklet for Berlitz Schools of Languages (1912); * Mrs Murphy (1913); * The Mountain Apart (under the pseudonym James Prosper) (1913); * Eliza's Son (1913); * The New Gulliver (1913); * One Kind And Another (1914); * The Short Story (1914); * Futurist Fifteen (1914); * Edwards (1915); * Me And Harris (1916); * Collected Tales (1916); * Confessions of Alphonse (1917); * Innocent Amusements (1918); * Says Mrs Hicks ( circa 1918); * The Problem Club (1919); * The Death of Maurice (1920); * Marge Askinforit (1920); * Going Home (1921) - a sentimental fantasy story about a winged man; * If Summer Don't (1921); * Tamplin's Tales of His Family (1924); * This Charming Green Hat Fair (1925); * Essays of Today And Yesterday (1926); * The Later Years (1927); * Dumphry (1927) Stories Barry Told Me by his daughter, Eva (Mrs T.L. Eckersley) was published in 1927. Stories in the Dark and Stories in Grey contain several of Pain's horror stories. 'Dark' contains the famous \\"The Moon-Slave\\". Alfred Noyes was a friend of Pain's and for several summers they were near neighbours at Rottingdean. In Noyes' autobiography, one of the longest chapters is devoted to Pain. Noyes particularly admired Pain's novel The Exiles of Faloo, of which he writes: \\"It is the story of an island in the Pacific, to which a number of scoundrels of various kinds, together with other men not entirely scoundrels but broken by the law, had escaped 'beyond the law's pursuing.' They establish a Club, with rules designed for the circumstances, one of which naturally was that no credit should be given. Gradually, through the original flaws in character, the society ends disastrously in conflict with the native population. There is humour and heroism, beauty and tragedy in the tale and, like all great stories, it is a parable\\". An Exchange of Souls is credited with being inspirational to H. P. Lovecraft, specifically in his short story \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\". In 2006, Hippocampus Press re-published An Exchange of Souls together with Henri B√©raud's Lazarus. =Adaptations= * In 1992 BBC2 adapted twelve of the stories from Eliza as \\"Life With Eliza\\", a series of 10-minute Edwardian comic monologues, featuring Sue Roderick as Eliza and John Sessions as her husband. * In 2006 Eliza was serialised by BBC Radio 4.

He founded Karsten Manufacturing, a golf club maker better known by the name of PING, and the Solheim Cup, the premier international team competition in women's golf. Early life Born in Bergen, Norway, to Herman A. and Ragna Koppen Solheim, the family emigrated to the United States in 1913, and settled in Seattle, Washington, in its Ballard neighborhood. Herman was a shoemaker, and Karsten graduated from Ballard High School in 1931 and enrolled two years later at the University of Washington, with aims at becoming a mechanical engineer. Due to family financial hardship during the Great Depression, he withdrew from UW after his freshman year and then worked in the family shoe shop. Upon the outbreak of World War II, he resumed his engineering studies via University of California extension courses and joined the defense industry, working at Ryan Aeronautical in San Diego. After the war he initially worked as a salesman, but then returned to engineering with positions at Convair and General Electric. Golf While living in upstate New York in 1954, Solheim took up golf at the age of 42 when his colleagues at G.E. invited him to make up a foursome. He quickly took to the game and found that his main problem was putting, so he designed himself a revolutionary putter. Using sugar cubes and popsicle sticks he came up with a design he would innovate and test. Instead of attaching the shaft at the heel of the blade, he attached it in the center. He applied scientific principles to golf club design, which had previously been based largely on trial and error, transferring much of the weight of the club head to the perimeter. Solheim took to manufacturing golf clubs in his garage and after a move to Phoenix he touted them to skeptical professionals at tournaments. Acceptance came when Julius Boros won the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open, using Solheim's \\"Anser\\" putter in early 1967. Later that year, Solheim resigned from G.E. to establish Karsten Manufacturing, makers of the PING brand of clubs. In 1969, he introduced irons based on the same principle of perimeter weighting, and these were quickly successful. The other golf equipment manufacturers soon followed his innovations, which became industry standards. With the success of PING, Solheim became a benefactor of golf. He donated millions of dollars to the Karsten Golf Course at Arizona State University and Karsten Creek Golf Course at Oklahoma State University, and sponsored LPGA tournaments in Oregon, Arizona, and Massachusetts. He was the driving force behind the creation of the Solheim Cup, the biennial tournament between teams of women professionals from Europe and the United States, which was modeled on the men's Ryder Cup, and was first played in 1990. 2009 Solheim Cup - Team of USA (2) Solheim developed Parkinson's disease and in 1995 he handed over his company to his youngest son John. He died in Phoenix in February 2000 at the age of 88. Solheim's contribution of perimeter weighting and usage of investment casting are recognized as two of the key innovations in the history of golf. Awards and recognition For increasing trade with foreign companies through Ping, Solheim received an \\"E\\" award from President Reagan in 1988. Solheim was inducted in 1991 into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame. Two collegiate golf courses bear his name: ASU Karsten Golf Course in Tempe, Arizona, opened in 1989, and Karsten Creek Golf Course in Stillwater, Oklahoma, opened in 1994. ME Hall of Fame recipient from University of Washington Mechanical Engineering. After his passing Karsten Solheim's wife Louise Solheim established an undergraduate scholarship fund and the Solheim Manufacturing Labs within the ME Department in memory of her late husband. Solheim was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2001 in the category of Lifetime Achievement.

He is commonly associated with other major Brazilian cultural interpreters of the first half of the 20th century, such as S√©rgio Buarque de Holanda and Caio Prado J√∫nior. His best- known work is a sociological treatise named Casa-Grande & Senzala (variously translated, but roughly The Main House and the Slave Quarters, as on a traditional plantation). Two sequels followed, The Mansions & the Shanties: The Making of Modern Brazil and Order & Progress: Brazil from Monarchy to Republic. The trilogy is generally considered a classic of modern cultural anthropology and social history, although it is not without its critics. Biography Freyre had an internationalist and precocious academic career, having studied at Baylor University, Texas from the age of eighteen and then at Columbia University, where he got his master's degree under the tutelage of William Shepperd. At Columbia Freyre was a student of the anthropologist Franz Boas. After coming back to Recife in 1923, Freyre spearheaded a handful of writers of the so-called Regionalista Movement. After working extensively as a journalist, he was made Head of Cabinet of the Governor of the State of Pernambuco, Est√°cio Coimbra. With the 1930 revolution and the rise of Get√∫lio Vargas, both Coimbra and Freyre went into exile. Freyre went first to Portugal and then to the US, where he worked as Visiting Professor at Stanford. By 1932, Freyre had returned to Brazil. In 1933, Freyre's best-known work, The Masters and the Slaves was published and was well received. In 1946, Freyre was elected to the federal Congress. At various times, Freyre also served as director of the newspapers A Prov√≠ncia and Diario de Pernambuco. In 1962, Freyre was awarded the Pr√™mio Machado de Assis of the Academia Brasileira de Letras (Brazilian Academy of Letters), one of the most prestigious awards in the field of Brazilian literature. Over the course of his long career, Freyre received numerous other awards, honorary degrees, and other honors both in Brazil and internationally. Examples include admission to L'ordre des Arts et Lettres (France), investiture as Grand Officier de La L√©gion d'Honneur (France), investiture as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Great Britain), the Gran-Cruz of the Ordem do Infante Dom Henrique (Portugal), and honorary doctorates at Columbia University and the Sorbonne. Freyre's most widely known work is The Masters and the Slaves (Casa-Grande & Senzala, 1933). This is a revolutionary work for the study of races and cultures in Brazil, written in a quite personal and impressionistic tone. The book is a turning point in the analysis of the black heritage in Brazil, which is highly extolled by Freyre. His effort both to rehabilitate the black culture and identify Brazil as a conciliatory country is comparable to the ones of other Latin American writers, such as Fernando Ortiz in Cuba (Contrapunteo Cubano de Tobacco y Az√∫car, 1940), and Jos√© Vasconcelos in Mexico (La Raza Cosmica, 1926). The Masters and the Slaves is the first of a series of three books, that included The Mansions and the Shanties (1938) and Order and Progress (1957). Other very important contributions of Freyre were Northeast (Nordeste) and The English in Brazil (1948). The actions of Freyre as a public intellectual are rather controversial. Labeled as a communist in the 1930s, he later moved to the political Right. He supported Portugal's Salazar government in the 1950s, and after 1964, defended the military dictatorship of Brazil's Humberto Castelo Branco. Freyre is considered to be the \\"father\\" of lusotropicalism: the theory whereby miscegenation had been a positive force in Brazil. \\"Miscegenation\\" at that time tended to be viewed in a negative way, as in the theories of Eugen Fischer and Charles Davenport.Gerald J. Bender, Angola under the Portuguese: The Myth and the Reality, Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, 1980, pp. xxiii, 5, 8 Freyre was acclaimed for his literary style. His poem \\"Bahia of all saints and of almost all sins\\" provoked Manuel Bandeira's enthusiasm. Freyre wrote this long poem inspired by his first visit to Salvador. Manuel Bandeira wrote about it in June 1927: \\"Your poem, Gilberto, will be an eternal source of jealousy to me\\"(cf. Manuel Bandeira, Poesia e Prosa. Rio de Janeiro: Aguilar, 1958, v. II: Prose, p. 1398).http://www.antoniomiranda.com.br/poesia_brasis/pernambuco/gilberto_freyre.html Freyre died on July 18, 1987 in Recife.

The term Prusik is a name for both the loops of cord and the hitch, and the verb is \\"to prusik\\". More casually, the term is used for any friction hitch or device that can grab a rope (see autoblock). Due to the pronunciation, the word is often misspelled Prussik, Prussick, or Prussic. The Prusik hitch is named after its putative inventor, Austrian mountaineer Karl Prusik. It was shown in a 1931 Austrian mountaineering manual for rope ascending. It was used on several mountaineering routes of the era to ascend the final summit, where a rope could be thrown over the top and anchored so that climbers could attain the summit by prusiking up the other side of the rope. A prusik made from cord does little or no damage to the rope it is attached to, although some mechanical prusiks can cause damage, especially if the device slips during climbing.  Advantages  Climbers carry Prusik cords mainly for emergency use, as they are lighter than other options. Prusiks are fast to place on a rope, and with practice can be placed with one hand. The loops of cord can be used as slings, and are thus multi-functional in a climbing environment. Prusiks will work around two ropes, even two ropes of different diameters. Prusiks provide a strong attachment that will not damage or break the rope, and so are used in some rope-rescue techniques. Prusiks are good to use in hauling systems where multiple rope-grabs may be needed, and where mechanical rope-grabs are not available. Prusiks are far less likely to damage the main rope than mechanical rope-grabs such as a jumar. A prusik which is overloaded will initially slip, causing no damage. If loaded to great excess, the worst result is that it slides until the heat of friction causes physical failure of the prusik cord, rather than the rope. Mechanical rope-grabs when overloaded will sometimes damage the sheath of the rope, or in extreme cases sever the rope entirely. Depending on which variant is used, Prusik hitches have the advantage of working in both directions. Most mechanical rope-grabs work like a ratchet, moving freely up the rope, but grabbing when a load is placed down on them. Traditional Prusiks (such as those shown below) will grab when pulled by the tail, either up or down, and will slide either way when pushed by the barrel. Although the Prusik Climb technique may be seen as outdated by some, the US Army still includes it in its annual Best Ranger competition. Rangers in the competition routinely make it up a 65-foot rope in under a minute.  Disadvantages  Prusiks are ineffective upon frozen wet ropes. This is due to the necessity of friction for the Prusik to function. Mechanical devices (such as jumars) to grab the rope are available that are easier and faster to use, but heavier, more expensive, and bulkier. After being put under a great deal of weight, the Prusik can be quite constricted and difficult to untie. This varies, depending on the relative diameter of the ropes.  Related hitches and equipment  Although prusik can be used in a general way, the Prusik hitch is a specific hitch. The two main alternatives are the Bachmann knot and the Klemheist knot (see also the Tarbuck knot). Each has its advantages and disadvantages, mainly in how easy they are to use for climbing a rope. Another variation is the Autoblock or French Prusik, used by some people as a backup knot while rappelling. A Purcell Prusik is a related cord popular among cavers and rope-rescue people. A somewhat longer loop than the normal Prusik is used around the rope, then a second Prusik is used around the cord loop itself to form a foot loop. The foot loop is then easily adjusted in length and position. A Prusik-Minding-Pulley is common in rope rescue. The rope to be pulled is passed through a pulley, and a Prusik is tied on the loaded side. When the rope is pulled, the Prusik rides against the pulley, and the rope slides through it; but when the rope is relaxed, the Prusik slides away from the pulley and grabs the rope. Thus, the combination acts as a ratchet. The Farrimond friction hitch is a kind of taut-line hitch that is similar in form to a Prusik.  Equipment  A Prusik loop is made of narrow but strong nylon accessory cord tied into a loop using a double fisherman's knot. A sling or prusik-dedicated sewn loop can also be used. Note that Dyneema/Spectra has a very low melting point and should not be used in Prusik hitches unless the cord or sling is specifically engineered for it (as seen in some sheathed constructions). The length of this loop depends on the application. For instance, the loop used for an Auto-Bloc might only be 20 cm, whereas the foot loop for climbing a rope might work better with a length of 100 cm or more. As a general rule, longer loops are preferable over shorter ones, as a loop can always be shortened by tying a knot in it. The effectiveness of the Prusik hitch relies on the surface area between the hitch and the main line, and the diameter of the cord used. Normally the greater difference between the diameter of the cord used for the hitch and the main line, the greater the ability for the hitch to hold. However, the smaller the diameter of the cord used, the lower its safe working load. In addition, smaller diameter cords often jam too tight when placed under load, and are hard to handle when wearing gloves.  Tying  The Prusik is tied by wrapping the prusik loop around the rope a number of times, usually 3-5 times depending on the materials, and then back through itself, forming a barrel around the rope with a tail hanging out the middle. When the tail is weighted, the turns tighten and make a bend in the rope. When weight is removed, the loop can be moved along the rope by placing a hand directly on the barrel and pushing. Breaking the Prusik free from the rope after it has been weighted can be difficult, however, and is most easily done by pushing the bow, the loop of cord which runs from the top wrap over the knot to the bottom wrap, along the tail a little. This unwinds the wrap to loosen the grip of the hitch, and makes movement easier. Image:prusikhowto1.saa.jpegStep 1. Image:prusikhowto2.saa.jpegStep 2. Image:prusikhowto3.saa.jpegStep 3. Image:Prusikhowto4.jpegStep 4. Image:Prusikhowto5.jpegLocked while holding tension. Image:prusikhowto6.saa.jpegSlides readily without tension. File:Three turn Prusik knot.jpgA variation of the Prusik knot with additional friction. Many materials may be used to tie a prusik. The exemplary prusik knot illustrated above is made with webbing, however webbing is not recommended for heavier loads and/or securing a person since it has been shown to slip.Steven M. Cox and Kris Fulsaal, Mountaineering: the Freedom of the Hills -7th ed. (Seattle: The Mountaineers Books, 2003), chapter 8. Adding more wraps increases the grip.  Applications  In addition to being a useful rope-grab for rope-rescue applications, Prusiks are popular for: *A Prusik (left) and Autoblock (right). Both are used as rappel backups.Rappel Backup/Self-Belay Below The Device: A Prusik is placed below the descender and controlled with the brake hand. It acts as an automatic 'dead man's handle' should the climber be incapacitated or need to use both hands. Careful setup of the rappel backup is critical. An 'Autoblock' or 'French Prusik' knot is most widely used in this application.http://ozultimate.com/canyoning/knots/french_prusik/ *Rappel Backup/Self-Belay Above The Device A Prusik is placed above the descender and controlled with the hand not being used as the brake hand. This configuration allows an easier and faster transition from rappeling to climbing the rope, but can also result in the Prusik locking tight as the amount of friction required to hold the load at that point is far higher than that experienced by a self-belay below the device. *Prusiking or ascending the line: Two prusiks used in tandem can be used to climb a fixed rope. One prusik is attached to the belay loop sewn onto the front of a harness, and the other attached below that is a longer length of cord reaching to one foot. The climber can then stand up in the foot loop, slide the prusik hitch of the waist loop further up the rope and then \\"sit\\" down on it. Once sitting, the climber can slide the foot loop up the rope and repeat the process. *Escaping the Belay: In a lead- climbing situation, should the climber become incapacitated in a position where they cannot be safely lowered to the ground, the belayer must escape the belay in order to effect rescue. After locking the rope in the belay device with one hand, the belayer can tie a prusik to the rope with the other hand, and then use the prusik loop to transfer the load to a fixed anchor. The belayer can then go to effect rescue or get help. *Rescue Applications Rope rescue teams, such as in swiftwater rescue or in high-angle technical rescue, use a Prusik hitch as a 'ratchet' or progress capture device. A prusik with a prusik minding pulley is used to hold a load while tensioning a line. The pulley advances the prusik up the line and prevents it from going back out. This can be used to raise a patient or tension a highline for a Tyrolean traverse, or in boat-on-tether and similar rescue operations. *HandcuffsBosun's or Prusik handcuffs A length of rope that has been tied so that the Prusik knot is tied around itself leaving two large loops can be quickly used as handcuffs by slipping the loops around the detainee's hands and pulling the running ends tight and securing them with a square knot. When the detainee attempts to pull his hands apart, the Prusik tightens in the same way as when it is tied to another rope. To create Prusik handcuffs, tie a loose Prusik around one of your fingers and then slip it off, leaving the knot shape intact. Then slip the free ends of the rope through the \\"hole\\" in the knot where your finger used to be. Alternatively, use a handcuff knot, which is the more usual knot to accomplish this task. *Testing rigs for tensile strength and pull force RepRap researchers have used the Prusik knot to secure a fiber in order to measure the pull force of an extruder mechanism and estimate the tensile strength of a fiber.  When to carry (climbing, kayaking)  All sorts of climbers carry prusiks as standard equipment \\"just in case\\". Prusiks are unlikely to be needed on short climbs where the climber can be readily lowered to the ground; conversely, they may prove useful where the climber cannot be lowered, for instance from a high cliff or due to a hazard underneath the climber. Prusiks can be tied using other climbing equipment, such as slings already carried by the climber. Three loops allow the climber to pass a knot in the rope, a difficult task without a third loop. Kayaking: For kayaking, a prusik can be used in a similar way as in climbing; for rescuing people and equipment from a river, a prusik or two with a set of pulleys to create a Z-drag is preferred.

It is found in the western Atlantic. It is associated with reefs and is a quarry species for commercial and recreational fisheries.  Description  The graysby has an oblong- shaped, robust body with a long snout and, when the mouth is closed, a slightly protruding upper jaw and a bony protruberance at the maxilla. The dorsal profile of the head is flat or slightly convex between its eyes. The majority of the teeth are movable. The dorsal fin contains 9 spines and 13-15 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 8 soft rays. The rounded peropercule has fine serrations on its margin but has no spines or notches, the operculum or gill cover has 3 flat spines, the central spine being the largest and upper spine is longer than the lowest. The caudal fin is rounded while the pelvic fins are shorter then the pectoral fins. The body is covered in rough scales and there are 69-81 scales in the lateral line. The head, body, and fins are grey, brown or olive in colour and are covered with orange- brown spots and there are normally four spots along their upper back, underneath the dorsal fin which can change colour between black and white. The maximum recorded total length for this species is , although they are more commonly around , and the heaviest specimen recorded was . A white stripe runs from the tip of the lower jaw, between the eyes and on to the nape. Distribution The Graysby is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. It is found from Cape Fear, North Carolina and Bermuda south to the Caribbean coast of South America. Claims of this species being recorded from Brazil require confirmation. Habitat and biology Pseudorhabdosynochus meganmarieae is a parasite of the graysby The graysby inhabits Thalassia beds and coral reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico, they are found on rocky reef ledge in depths greater than . A solitary and secretive species, they usually stay near hiding places during the day. They prefer to remain within a small area of the home range of about , especially during the day. The graysby is a nocturnal predator, adults feed mainly on fishes, with preference on Chromis multilineata, juveniles feed on shrimps. These fishes are protogynous hermaphrodites they all start life as female to male becoming males in their middle age. Sex change takes place at 4 or 5 years old and at lengths of . The change in sex occurs straight after the spawning period in August and September. The males vigorously guard a harem which have an average of one male to six female. When spawning, a female will releases between 260 and 600 eggs and the male then releases his milt to fertilise them. They can live for up to 13 years. It is parasitized by Pseudorhabdosynochus meganmarieae. Taxonomy The graysby was first formally described in 1802 as Sparus cruentatus by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de (1756-1825) with the type locality given as the Antilles and Bahamas. Utilisation The graysby is a quarry species for both commercial fisheries and for anglers. It makes up 11% of the commercial reef- fish catch in Curacao and it was taken by line, trap and spear fisheries in Honduras in the past but constitutes only a small part of the total reef-fish catchin Honduras. It is common around Cuba where it is not an important quarry species for fisheries. In the United States the fisheries for this species fall under the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council and the both commercial and recreational fisheries have a close season which runs from 1 January to 30 April.

It is situated on the West of England Main Line, down the line from . Opened in 1860, it is currently operated by South Western Railway. History The station was opened by the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway (S&YR;) on 7 May 1860, when the company extended its line from Gillingham to Sherborne. A level crossing across the line was at the east end of the platforms, and the goods yard with a goods shed at the west end; this and the main buildings were on the north side of the line to be nearer the town. Another siding on the other side of the line served the town‚Äôs gas works which had been established in 1836. A signal box was erected on the east side of the level crossing and to the south of the line in 1875. The S&YR; never operated any trains, instead they were provided by the London and South Western Railway, which bought out the S&YR; in 1878. In 1923 this became part of the Southern Railway, which in turn was nationalised in 1948 to become the Southern Region of British Railways. In 1960 the signal box was replaced by a new one on the opposite side of the line, but after this a decline set in. From 1963 the line was transferred to the Western Region, and in that year the Reshaping of British Railways report was published. The smaller stations were soon closed, and most trains beyond were diverted to other routes. The gas works had stopped receiving coal in 1957 and all goods traffic was stopped from 18 April 1966. On 7 May 1967 the to was reduced to single track, but this proved a mistake and the double track was restored as far as on 1 October. The signal box was closed on 4 January 1970 when the level crossing was converted to lifting barriers which were for many years controlled by a member of staff from a panel at the end of the eastbound platform. In March 2012 a modern signalling system for the Salisbury-Exeter line was commissioned and the line, including crossings, is now controlled remotely by the Basingstoke Area Signalling Centre. Remote control of the crossing eliminated the need for constant staff presence at the station during train operating hours, allowing South West Trains to reduce the hours of ticket office staffing.http://www.thisisdorset.co.uk/Sherborne-railway-station-ticket- office-cuts/story-15362773-detail/story.html Description The level crossing with the disused signal box beyond. The entrance and offices are on the northern platform which is served by trains going towards London. A large canopy covers much of the other platform. This is normally reached by crossing a footbridge, but people who find this difficult to use can cross the track under the supervision of the signaller who operates the level crossing. The old signal box still stands on the other side of this, and at the other end of the station can be seen the old goods shed. The station buffet appeared in a list of \\"highly commended\\" station cafes published in The Guardian in 2009.

Appertization is the method of processing vegetables that leads to them being canned. The term comes from Nicolas Appert, who invented the first process for using heat to sterilize food. Cirio was born in Nizza Monferrato, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, to a poor and illiterate family. When he was 14 years old he came to the capital of the kingdom, Turin. In 1856, Cirio started preserving tomatoes in tin cans in order for them to be exported. He created his own company (later named Cirio), and when he was 20 years old, he started his first factory in Turin. In 1861, he added further plantations and production facilities in Southern Italy. In 1867, Cirio exhibited his products in Paris at the Exposition Universelle, where he received prestigious awards.

He pitched in Major League Baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. He throws and bats right-handed. Professional career =New York Yankees= Brazob√°n was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New York Yankees on July 10, 1997 and proceeded to hit .319 as an outfielder for the Yankees Dominican Summer League, earning a spot on the Dominican League All-Star Team. In 1999‚Äì2000 he made the Gulf Coast League All-Star team, hitting .320 and .303, earning a promotion to Single-A Greensboro in 2000 and playing there through 2002. The Yankees converted Brazob√°n from an outfielder to a pitcher in 2003, sending him to three different minor league levels to work on his pitching: the Gulf Coast Yankees, Tampa Yankees and Trenton Thunder. Combined he was 2‚Äì4 with 18 saves in 47 relief appearances. =Los Angeles Dodgers= He was acquired by the Los Angeles Dodgers from the Yankees on December 13, 2003 along with Jeff Weaver and Brandon Weeden in exchange for right-hander Kevin Brown. He earned a call- up to the Dodgers in 2004 after a sensational year at Class AA Jacksonville and Class AAA Las Vegas. Brazob√°n made his Major League debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 5, 2004, working one scoreless inning of relief against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Primarily a setup man for √âric Gagn√© during the 2004 season, he became the Dodgers closer for a brief time in 2005 after Gagn√© was lost for the season with an injury. He established new Dodgers rookie records by appearing in 75 games and recording 21 saves. Brazoban entered the 2006 season as a member of a strong Dodgers bullpen. He and Danys B√°ez, who was acquired for the 2006 season but was later traded, were slotted to work as setup men for closer √âric Gagn√©. However, early in the year Brazoban went on the disabled list with an elbow injury that cost him the entire season. He underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right elbow. He worked his way back from the injury to rejoin the Dodgers' bullpen in May 2007, but after a few appearances he suffered another serious arm injury and was lost for the rest of the 2007 season. After two serious injuries in a row, he opened the 2008 season in the minors with the Jacksonville Suns. He pitched well enough in the minors to earn a return to the Dodgers bullpen, and the Dodgers called him up on May 9. He appeared in two games with the Dodgers in 2008, allowing two earned runs in three innings while striking out three batters and walking three, before the Dodgers again optioned him to Las Vegas. On July 19, the Dodgers placed him on the disabled list for the rest of the season with another shoulder injury. He was released after the season but eventually re-signed to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. However, he was released again on March 19, 2009. =Mexican League / New York Mets= Brazoban began the 2010 season in the Mexican League, where he was 4‚Äì3 with a 2.22 ERA in 52 relief appearances for Minatitlan and Mexico City. On August 15, 2010, he was signed to a minor league deal with the New York Mets, and was assigned to Triple-A Buffalo. He was in 10 games with Buffalo, with a 6.10 ERA. =Texas Rangers= On December 16, 2010, he was signed to a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers. He played in 16 games with the Round Rock Express and was released on June 2, 2011 with a 3.42 ERA. =Arizona Diamondbacks= Later that day, he signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks and was assigned to the Triple-A Reno Aces. After 8 games with the Aces, he had his contract purchased on June 28. He was outrighted to the minors on July 20. =Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks= Brazoban was sold to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in Japan on July 29, 2011. =Vaqueros Laguna= On March 14, 2012, Brazoban signed with the Vaqueros Laguna of the Mexican Baseball League.

Commonly called greenhood orchids, they are terrestrial, deciduous, perennial, tuberous, herbs found in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, New Caledonia and one Indonesian island. The flowers are mostly green, sometimes with brown, reddish or white stripes, and are distinguished from other orchids by their unusual flower structures and pollination mechanism. Description Greenhood orchids are all terrestrial herbs with an underground tuber like many other genera of orchids but are distinguished by a hood-like \\"galea\\" formed by the fusing of the dorsal sepal and two lateral petals. The galea curves forward, covers the sexual parts of the flower, is important in the pollination process and is about as long as the two petals. The dorsal sepal is translucent white with green, reddish or brown stripes. The two lateral sepals are joined at their base, form the front of the flower and usually protrude to form \\"points\\" or \\"ears\\" which extend above or to the side of the galea. The third (medial) petal forms the highly modified labellum. As in other orchids, the sexual parts of the flower form part of the column and in all greenhoods, this structure has a pair of mostly translucent wings and is also important in pollination. The tuber of a greenhood is usually more or less spherical in shape and lasts for about a year then dies. A new one is produced early in the life of the parent tuber at the same time as a new shoot is produced and continues to grow, reaching maturity at the end of the growing season. In some species, a larger number of \\"daughter\\" tubers grow, and a colony of orchids is produced. The leaves are either attached in a rosette to the base of the peduncle or \\"stalk\\" of the plant by a short petiole, or further up it, in which case the leaves are sessile. There may be one or several flowers on the peduncle. The fruit of a greenhood is a dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 tiny seeds and is oblong to elliptic in shape with three ridges. Other parts of the flower wither soon after pollination and the dry remains are attached to the end of the capsule. Taxonomy and naming The first observation of Pterostylis by European botanists was probably by Joseph Banks when visited Botany Bay in 1770 but any specimens collected were lost later in the voyage. The first formal description of a greenhood was by Jacques Labillardi√®re who collected a specimen from Bruny Island and gave it the name Disperis alata. After several name changes, Disperis alata is now known as Pterostylis alata. John White, the first surgeon-general of the colony of New South Wales collected several species and George Caley collected 208 greenhood specimens from 16 species and described them in great detail, including details of their habitat and gave them names like Druids Cap patersoni but did not publish his work. The genus Pterostylis was first raised by Robert Brown who formally described 19 species but did not nominate a type species. The species he described were collected from the east coast of the mainland and from Tasmania and the descriptions were published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. Alan Cunningham was the first to describe a New Zealand species, P. banksii and John Lindley described the first four Western Australian species, P. vittata, P. pyramidalis, P. barbata and P. scabra from specimens collected by James Drummond. About 300 species are recognised and about 200 of them have been formally described and named. In 2001 the genus Pterostylis was split such that two new genera, Plumatichilos and Oligochaetochilus, were established based on morphological characters. These divisions effectively separated species with a thread-like, feathery labellum (Plumatichilos), and those with downward-curved lateral sepals (Oligochaetochilus) from the remaining Pterostylis species. The following year, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed further separating Pterostylis into sixteen genera based on a combination of molecular and morphological characters: the genera Bunochilus, Crangonorchis, Diplodium, Eremorchis, Hymenochilus, Linguella, Oligochaetochilus, Petrorchis, Pharochilum, Plumatichilos, Ranorchis, Speculantha, Stamnorchis, Taurantha and Urochilus. These changes were not adopted widely by Australian herbaria as the data appeared to support a monophyletic group. In 2010, further molecular work reinstated Pterostylis as a monophyletic group with two subgenera distinguishing species with lateral sepals that are bent sharply downwards (\\"deflexed\\") from those with the lateral sepals bent backwards (\\"recurved\\"). The genus name (Pterostylis) is derived from the Greek words pteron meaning 'wing' and stylos meaning 'pillar' or 'post', but in orchids, generally applies to the column. The clostest relative of Pterostylis is Achlydosa, restricted to New Caledonia and the sole other genus of subtribe Pterostylidinae. Distribution and habitat Orchids in the genus Pterostylis occur mostly in Australia but are also found in New Zealand, including some of its smaller islands such as Chatham Island, and in New Caledonia, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland and on Seram Island in Indonesia. In Australia they are found in all states and Lord Howe Island, but not in the Northern Territory. They grow in a wide range of habitats, especially in temperate zones and are found in grassland, heath, scrub, woodland and forest, including rainforest. They sometimes grow in semi-arid areas but usually near rocks or crevices where there is run-off during rain. In tropical regions they tend to grow at higher altitudes where temperatures are lower. Most have periods of dormancy which coincide with climatic extremes, surviving as small tubers until favourable conditions return. Ecology Most greenhoods are pollinated by insects, nearly always by tiny flies from the family Mycetophilidae or by mosquitoes (Family Culicidae). The insect approaches the flower from downwind, as if attracted by a scent and usually lands on the galea. (In the case of Pterostylis sanguinea, the pollinator is a male fungus gnat of the genus Mycomya which attempts to copulate with the labellum, which produces the chemical attractant.) The insect then enters the flower and either because it has passed a balance point, or because it has touched a sensitive part of the labellum, the labellum moves forward trapping the insect between the column wings, the labellum and other flower parts. Observation of the insect's reaction to entrapment is difficult to observe, but in its struggle to escape, it either deposits pollinia from a previously visited flower or contacts the sticky viscidium and pollinia are attached, then carried to another flower. The features of an actively-moving labellum, along with the galea, are unique to these orchids.  Uses  = Use in horticulture = Greenhoods are easily grown in pots and usually flower well, filling the pot in a few years. Pterostylis curta and P. nutans can be grown in commercial orchid potting mix with coarse gravel added. A bushhouse or cool glasshouse are needed for some species. Greenhoods need regular watering in the growing seaseon but must be kept dry when dormant.

The system gained notoriety after it was discovered that one can effectively disable the system by tracing the outer edge of a CD with a felt-tip marker.http://www.slate.com/id/2066527/ The system works by applying a bogus data track onto the disc during glass master manufacturing. Since computers are designed to read data before music, this prevents playback on a PC and thereby prevents ripping as well as ordinary listening using a computer. CD players ignore any non-audio tracks on a disc, and can therefore play the CD unimpeded - Enhanced CDs also take advantage of this factor. Currently there are two major versions of the key2Audio protection: the original key2Audio, and key2AudioXS. key2Audio key2audio products are highly compatible because the audio session is not modified. Since additional data sessions are used, the CD is not Red Book compliant and should not use the \\"Compact Disc\\" logo. As with any passive DRM technology some players are unable to play the non-standard disc. Since optical computer CD/DVD drives are also capable of reading Red Book audio CDs, a lot of player manufacturers use these same CD/DVD ROM drives instead of specialized Audio CD / Video DVD only drives in order to reduce costs. DVD players and car stereo systems seem to have most problems with incompatibilities of key2Audio protected CDs. A protected CD still achieves a maximum recording time of 77 minutes and supports full ISRC, UPC and CD-Text capabilities. Early versions of this copy protection were infamous for being easily circumvented with a marker pen, by drawing a circle on the rim of the visible edge of audio data. =Technical background= It appears that key2Audio protected disc TOC contains three sessions written on the disc. Two of them contain small data tracks, and one contains the audio tracks. The regular CD players pick the audio tracks outright, while the computer CD and DVD players get confused by the corrupted TOC information. CD players and drives that do not support multisession discs are immune to this confusion. It can be worked around by e.g. CloneCD or Exact Audio Copy. key2AudioXS key2audioXS combines a PC playback and a clone-proof Multimedia session for CD-Extra and Web Links. The new version of this protection allows the listener the right to play the CD on a PC, and allows controlled burning the audio to CD. This solution allows consumers a limited amount of private copies. The record labels can individually define the burn count. These copies are then also fully protected and offer the same efficiency and compatibility as the original disc. The audio sessions are being encoded to Windows Media Audio DRM-protected files, so that some portable devices are supported and online distribution prevented. Furthermore, with key2audioXS the user can now pick and send audio tracks via email. With a usability period defined by the record label, users can share music, facilitating promotion activities for labels. Additionally, some discs feature \\"n-CD\\", which lets the user access bonus features such as videos, ringtones, lotteries and the like. The original n-CD is a unique key reserved for just their owners. For this purpose, the user interface for key2Audio on PC allows for navigation and includes a copying and burning tool, as well as additional content such as bonus pictures and lyrics. The audio part can hold up to 75 minutes. Notes External links * Key2Audio explained and should we fear it?

It was written by Ross Bagdasarian and his cousin, Armenian American Pulitzer Prize winning author William Saroyan, while driving across New Mexico in the summer of 1939. The melody is based on an Armenian folk song. The lyrics reference traditional Armenian customs of inviting over relatives and friends and providing them with a generously overflowing table of fruits, nuts, seeds, and other foods. It was not performed until the 1950 off-Broadway production of The Son. The song did not become a hit until the release of Clooney's recording. It was probably Saroyan's only effort at popular songwriting, and it was one of Bagdasarian's few well-known works that was not connected to his best-known creation, Alvin and the Chipmunks. Bagdasarian, as David Seville, went on to much fame with his Chipmunks recordings. Rosemary Clooney's original hit version The song was first performed during 1950 in an off-Broadway production of The Son, but did not become a hit until the release of Clooney's recording. A major hit for Clooney in 1951, it was the first of a number of dialect songs she did. She recorded it in the early part of 1951, with Mitch Miller leading an ensemble of four musicians, including harpsichordist Stan Freeman. It reached #1 on the Billboard charts, staying in the top position for six weeks. Clooney sang the song in the 1953 film The Stars Are Singing, in a scene where she ended up mocking it, remarking that no one would listen to it. Although she performed \\"Come on-a My House\\" for many years, Clooney later confessed that she hated the song. She said she had been given a practice record of it and had told Miller it wasn't for her. Miller gave her an ultimatum: record the song or be fired. During a 1988 interview, Clooney said that whenever she listened to the recording she could hear the anger in her voice from being forced to sing it. Cover versions The song was covered by Ella Fitzgerald, as one side of a single whose other side was also a cover of a Clooney hit, \\"Mixed Emotions,\\" on Decca Records (catalog number 27875). Louis Prima covered it (with an Italian spin) alongside Keely Smith on Sing Loud, released in 1960 by Coronet Records. He also recorded it in 1951 on Robin Hood Records, and again in 1958 on Moonglow. The song was also a hit for Kay Starr, who added a few lines with funny, nearly surrealistic details and ended with an even more explicit offer. In 1952, Japanese singer Chiemi Eri covered the Kay Starr version. Della Reese also recorded the song, and it is her version that Madonna mimes to in the remake of Swept Away. Many have offered an untraditional twist, such as Mickey Katz singing in Yiddish, Julie London oozing a more blatant sexiness in her version, and Eartha Kitt performing a rendition in Japanese. It was later used as the theme for the reality television series The Girls Next Door, performed by the Nasty Tales and their orchestra. The Surf Punks remade the song in the late 1980s. The composers themselves performed it - Bagdasarian singing, Saroyan offering occasional narration - for Coral Records. Bagdasarian also performs the song on his album The Mixed-Up World of Ross Bagdasarian and Alvin and the Chipmunks sang it for their 1994 Thanksgiving television special A Chipmunk Celebration. In the 1987 animated movie The Chipmunk Adventure, it is sung briefly by Miss Miller, voiced by Dody Goodman. American Country music artist K. T. Oslin covered the song on her 2001 album, Live Close By, Visit Often. Her version reached #40 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. It was covered by Captain & Tennille as a bonus track on their 2002 More Than Dancing...Much More CD. Actress Janis Hansen can be heard singing a version a cappella while showering in \\"To Steal a Battleship,\\" an episode of the 1968 television series, It Takes a Thief. Salsa Legend Celia Cruz also did a cover called \\"Ven A Mi Casa\\" with both Spanish and English lyrics. Bette Midler included a version of the song on her 2003 Rosemary Clooney covers album Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook. Actress/Singer Bernadette Peters performs a cover in the Amazon series Mozart in the Jungle (Season 2, Episode 4, \\"Touch√© Maestro, Touch√©\\") https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/arts/television/mozart-in-the-jungle-where- classical-music-meets-soap-opera.html Parody In late 1951 MGM Records released a novelty answer song, \\"Where's-a Your House?\\", which charted on the Cash Box Hot 50 list. Sung by Robert Q. Lewis in dialect, the tune details the singer's frustrated attempts to follow up \\"Rosie's\\" invitation. In 1974, American rock band Sparks titled their third album Kimono My House, a pun on the song's title. In 1978, on the episode of M*A*S*H entitled \\"Major Topper,\\" the eccentric \\"Boot\\" Miller (played by Hamilton Camp), apparently believing that he is Rosemary Clooney, sings \\"Come On-a My House\\" into a ladle in the mess tent.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638357/ References Category:1939 songs Category:1951 singles Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Songs written by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. Category:Rosemary Clooney songs Category:Song recordings produced by Mitch Miller ","title":"Come On-a My House"},{"id":"2459204","text":"The Minokok are an indigenous ethnic group residing in Sabah, Malaysia.

Also a poet, dramatist, and Pan- African activist, Nascimento created the Black Experimental Theater (1944) and the Black Arts Museum (1950), organized the National Convention of Brazilian Blacks (1946), the First Congress of Brazilian Blacks (1950), and the Third Congress of Black Culture in the Americas (1982). Professor Emeritus, State University of New York at Buffalo, he was the first Afro-Brazilian member of Congress to champion black people‚Äôs human and civil rights in the National Legislature, where in 1983 he presented the first Brazilian proposals for affirmative action legislation. He served as Rio de Janeiro State Secretary for the Defense and Promotion of Afro-Brazilian People and Secretary of Human Rights and Citizenship. While working as curator of the Black Arts Museum project, he began developing his own creative work (painting), and from 1968 on, he exhibited widely in the U.S., Brazil and abroad. He received national and international honors for his work, including UNESCO‚Äôs special Toussaint Louverture Award for contribution to the fight against racism, granted to him and to poet Aim√© C√©saire in 2004. He was officially nominated for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. Early life Born in Franca, S√£o Paulo state, Nascimento attended public school as a child and joined the military in 1929, but was expelled from the Army due to his resistance against racial discrimination a few years later. He received a B.A. in Economics from the University of Rio de Janeiro in 1938, and graduate degrees from the Higher Institute of Brazilian Studies (1957) and the Oceanography Institute (1961).  Black Experimental Theater  From 1939 to 1941, Nascimento traveled throughout South America with a group of poets who called themselves the \\"Santa Hermandad Orquidea\\", or \\"Holy Brotherhood of the Orchid.\\" At the Municipal Theater of Lima, Peru, they attended a performance of Eugene O'Neill's play The Emperor Jones with a blackfaced white actor in the leading role. Then and there, he decided to create a black theater in Brazil to fight against racism. In Argentina, Nascimento spent a year with the \\"Teatro del Pueblo\\" (People's Theater) in Buenos Aires, where he learned the technical and performance aspects of theater. Returning to S√£o Paulo, he was imprisoned, having been convicted in absentia by the civilian court for the same incident of resisting racial discrimination for which he had been excluded from the Army. While in prison at the Carandiru Penitentiary, he created the Convict's Theater, in which prisoners wrote, directed, and performed in their own plays and musical productions. When released, Nascimento moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he founded the Black Experimental Theater (Teatro Experimental do Negro, TEN) in 1944. TEN premiered on May 8, 1945 with a production of O'Neill's The Emperor Jones, surprising skeptical critics with a presentation that was highly acclaimed for its technical and dramatic effectiveness. With intense activity in theatrical production, TEN also was responsible for stellar initiatives in black activism, such as the National Convention of Brazilian Blacks (1945‚Äì46), the Conference of Brazilian Blacks (1949), and the First Congress of Brazilian Blacks (1950). A resolution of the 1950 congress advocated the need for a Black Arts Museum in Brazil, and the Black Experimental Theater embraced the project. Many artists donated works and the first exhibition was held in 1968 at Rio de Janeiro's Museu da Imagem e do Som (Museum of Image and Sound). The Black Experimental Theater organized the cast for the play Orfeu da Concei√ß√£o, by Vinicius de Moraes, which was later adapted into the motion picture Black Orpheus, directed by Marcel Camus. Life in exile Nascimento became a leader in Brazil's black movement, and was forced into exile by the military regime in 1968. From 1968 to 1981 Nascimento was very active in the international Pan-African Movement and was elected Vice-President and Coordinator of the Third Congress of Black Culture in the Americas. For the next decade Nascimento was a visiting professor at several universities in the United States, including the Yale School of Drama (1969‚Äì1971), and University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, where he founded the chair in African Cultures in the New World, Puerto Rican Studies Program in 1971. He held the position of Professor Emeritus at SUNY-Buffalo. Nascimento also taught at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in Nigeria. Return to Brazil Nascimento returned to Brazil in 1983 and was elected to the federal Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Democratic Labor Party (PDT). There, his focus was supporting legislation to address racial problems. In 1994 he was elected to the Senate and served until 1999. In 2004 he was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Peace. A biography of Nascimento by the journalist Sandra Almada was published in 2009 as part of the Retratos do Brasil Negro series. Nascimento suffered from diabetes and died on 23 May 2011, in Rio de Janeiro, due to cardiac arrest.Death of Abdias Nascimento (in Portuguese)Obituary in USA Africa Dialogue Series: \\"In Memoriam for Abdias do Nascimento 1914‚Äì2011\\" by Molefi Kete Asante Selected publications * \\"Africans in Brazil: a Pan-African perspective\\" (1997) * \\"Orix√°s: os deuses vivos da Africa\\" (Orishas: the living gods of Africa in Brazil) (1995) * \\"Race and ethnicity in Latin America ‚Äì African culture in Brazilian art\\" (1994) * \\"Brazil, mixture or massacre?

The book was released on Friday, October 13, 2006.  Plot  The book begins with the Baudelaire orphans and Count Olaf on a boat heading away from the burning Hotel Denouement. After a storm, the Baudelaires arrive and are welcomed on an island by a young girl named Friday. Count Olaf, however, is not welcomed due to his snobby attitude and death threat to Friday. Later, the pregnant Kit Snicket and a friendly snake known as the \\"Incredibly deadly adder\\" (which first appeared in The Reptile Room) are shipwrecked on the island. Count Olaf disguises himself as Kit, but for the first time in the series, Olaf's disguise fools nobody, and the Islanders, led by a man called Ishmael, capture him and shun the Baudelaires for their possessing forbidden items. That night, two of the islanders sneak out to feed the children, asking them to join a mutiny. Agreeing, the Baudelaires go to the arboretum to collect weapons, where they discover a hidden room with a book that chronicles the history of the island. Ishmael arrives, explaining to the children that their parents were once the island's leaders and were responsible for many improvements in island life, but were eventually overthrown by Ishmael, who brought the island back to a simple and austere way of life while hoarding comforts for himself. The Baudelaires and Ishmael go back to the other side of the island, where the mutiny is already underway. Ishmael harpoons Olaf in the stomach, inadvertently shattering the helmet containing the Medusoid Mycelium, a deadly fungus, infecting the island's entire population. The Baudelaires run back to the arboretum to find horseradish, a cure for the fungus. While reading through the book left by their parents to find where the horseradish is hidden, the three continue to be affected by the fungus and, after some deliberation, accept their deaths. They eventually find that the cure is in the hybridized apples on a tree in the arboretum. They gather apples for the other islanders, only to discover that the island people have abandoned the mutiny and boarded their outrigger canoe, preparing to leave the island. Ishmael promises that he will save the islanders by sailing to a horseradish factory, but refuses to give them the apples, despite having already consumed one himself. At this point, Kit is about to go into labor. Though she is succumbing to the fungus, she cannot eat the bitter apple due to its unhealthy effects on unborn babies. When the dying Olaf hears that she is still alive, he uses his last effort to get her safely down onto the beach, where he kisses Kit and dies soon after. The Baudelaires help Kit give birth to a baby girl. Kit then dies after requesting that the orphans name the baby after their mother Beatrice. The Baudelaires spend the next year taking care of Kit's daughter, occasionally visiting the graves of Kit and Olaf. After reading an entry from the history book written by their parents, the Baudelaires decide to leave the island with Beatrice in order to honor their parents' wishes. Despite their fears about the outside world, the children prepare a boat and supplies for their journey back to the mainland and Beatrice says her first word, which is Beatrice. Reception With sales of over 2 million copies in the United States, The End was the bestselling children's book of 2006 according to Publishers Weekly, who also reported 3 million sales of the previous 12 books in the series in the same year.

The large (roughly half a millimeter) parasites inhabit the intestines of many invertebrates. They are not found in any vertebrates. However, gregarines are closely related to both Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, which cause toxoplasmosis and malaria, respectively. Both protists use protein complexes similar to those that are formed by the gregarines for gliding motility and invading target cells. This makes them excellent models for studying gliding motility with the goal of developing treatment options for toxoplasmosis and malaria. Thousands of different species of gregarines are expected to be found in insects, and 99% of these gregarines still need to be described. Each insect can be the host of multiple species. One of the most studied gregarines is Gregarina garnhami. In general, gregarines are regarded as very successful parasites, as their hosts are spread over the entire planet. Lifecycle Gregarines occur in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Although they are usually transmitted by the orofaecal route, some are transmitted with the host's gametes during copulation (Monocystis). In all species, four or more sporozoites (the precise number depends on the species) equipped with an apical complex escape from the oocysts, a process called excystation, find their way to the appropriate body cavity, and penetrate host cells in their immediate environment. The sporozoites emerge within the host cell, begin to feed, and develop into larger trophozoites. In some species, the sporozoites and trophozoites are capable of asexual replication ‚Äî a process called schizogony or merogony. Most species, however, appear to lack schizogony in their lifecycles. In all species, two mature trophozoites eventually pair up in a process known as syzygy and develop into gamonts. During syzygy, gamont orientation differs between species (side-to- side, head-to-tail). A gametocyst wall forms around each pair of gamonts, which then begin to divide into hundreds of gametes. Zygotes are produced by the fusion of two gametes, and these, in turn, become surrounded by an oocyst wall. Within the oocyst, meiosis occurs, yielding the sporozoites. Hundreds of oocysts accumulate within each gametocyst and these are released via host's faeces or via host death and decay. Lankesteria cystodytae is an intestinal parasite of ascidians. These aseptate gregarines lack epimerites and instead possess attachment organelles known as mucrons Gregarines have been reported to infect over 3000 invertebrate species.Alarc√≥n M E., Huang C-G, Tsai Y-S, Chen W-J, Kumar A (2011) Life cycle and morphology of Steinina ctenocephali (Ross 1909) comb. nov. (Eugregarinorida: Actinocephalidae), a gregarine of Ctenocephalides felis (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) in Taiwan. Zoological Studies 50(6): 763-772 Taxonomy The gregarines were recognised as a taxon by Grasse in 1953. The three orders into which they are currently divided were created by Levine et al. in 1980. Currently, about 250 genera and 1650 species are known in this taxon. They are divided into three orders based on habitat, host range, and trophozoite morphology. Most species have monoxenous lifecycles involving a single invertebrate host. In the lifecycle, the extracellular feeding stage is known as the trophozoite. =Main divisions= Archigregarines are found only in marine habitats. They possess intestinal trophozoites similar in morphology to the infective sporozoites. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this group is paraphyletic and will need division. Generally, four zoites are in each spore in this group. Eugregarines are found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. These species possess large trophozoites that are significantly different in morphology and behavior from the sporozoites. This taxon contains most of the known gregarine species. The intestinal eugregarines are separated into septate ‚Äî suborder Septatorina ‚Äî and aseptate ‚Äî suborder Aseptatorina ‚Äî depending on whether the trophozoite is superficially divided by a transverse septum. The aseptate species are mostly marine gregarines. Urosporidians are aseptate eugregarines that infect the coelomic spaces of marine hosts. Unusually, they tend to lack attachment structures and form gamont pairs that pulsate freely within the coelomic fluid. Monocystids are aseptate eugregarines that infect the reproductive vesicles of terrestrial annelids. These latter species tend to branch closely with neogregarines and may need to be reclassified. Generally, eight zoites are in each spore in this group. Neogregarines are found only in terrestrial hosts. These species have reduced trophozoites and tend to infect tissues other than the intestine. Usually, eight zoites are in each spore in this group. The eugregarines and neogregarines differ in a number of respects. The neogregarines are in general more pathogenic to their hosts. The eugregarines multiply by sporogony and gametogony, while the neogregarines have an additional schizogenic stage ‚Äî merogony ‚Äî within their hosts. Merogony may be intracellular or extracellular depending on the species. DNA studies suggest the archigregarines are ancestral to the others. =Proposed revisions= Cavalier-Smith has proposed a significant revision of this taxon assuming the polyphyly of eugregarines. He has separated gregarines into three classes. The first of them ‚Äî Gregarinomorphea ‚Äî comprises Orthogregarinia, Cryptosporidiidae and, additionally, Rhytidocystidae previously considered as divergent coccidians or Apicomplexa incertae sedis. The Orthogregarinia with two new orders Arthrogregarida and Vermigregarida was created for the gregarines most closely related to Cryptosporidium. The second class ‚Äî Paragregarea ‚Äî was created for the archigregarines, Stenophorida and a new order ‚Äî Velocida which itself was created for Urosporoidea superfam. n. and Veloxidium. The third class was created ‚Äî Squirmida ‚Äî for Filipodium and Platyproteum. Thus, the eugregarines proved to be split and distributed among these three classes together with some other apicomplexans. This point of view was challenged in 2017 by Simdyanov and co-authors, who performed the global integrated analysis of available morphological and molecular phylogenetic data and concluded that eugregarines are rather a monophyletic taxon. Several genera of gregarines are currently not classified: Acuta, Cephalolobus, Gregarina, Levinea, Menospora, Nematocystis, Nematopsis, Steinina, and Trichorhynchus. Characteristics *Meiosis occurs in all species. *Monoxenous ‚Äî only one host occurs in lifecycle for almost all species. *Mitochondria have tubular cristae and are often distributed near the cell periphery. *Apical complex occurs in the sporozoite stage, but is lost in the trophozoite stage in eugregarines and neogregarines. *Trophozoites have a large and conspicuous nucleus and nucleolus. *They inhabit extracellular body cavities of invertebrates such as the intestines, coeloms, and reproductive vesicles. *Attachment to host occurs by a mucron (aseptate gregarines) or an epimerite (septate gregarines); some gregarines (urosporidians) float freely within extracellular body cavities (coelom). The parasites are relatively large, spindle-shaped cells, compared to other apicomplexans and eukaryotes in general (some species are in length). Most gregarines have longitudinal epicytic folds (bundles of microtubules beneath the cell surface with nematode like bending behaviour): crenulations are instead found in the urosporidians. Molecular biology The gregarines are able to move and change direction along a surface through gliding motility without the use of cilia, flagella, or lamellipodia. This is accomplished through the use of an actin and myosin complex. The complexes require an actin cytoskeleton to perform their gliding motions. In the proposed ‚Äòcapping‚Äô model, an uncharacterized protein complex moves rearward, moving the parasites forward. History The gregarines are among the oldest known parasites, having been described by the physician Francesco Redi in 1684. The first formal description was made by Dufour in 1828. He created the genus Gregarina and described Gregarina ovata from Folficula aricularia. He considered them to be parasitic worms. Koelliker recognised them as protozoa in 1848.

Early harquebusiers were characterised by the use of a form of carbine, called a \\"harquebus\\". In England, harquebusier was the technical name for this type of cavalry, though in everyday usage they were usually simply called 'cavalry' or 'horse'. In Germany they were often termed Ringerpferd, or sometimes Reiter, in Sweden they were called l√§tta ryttare.Brzezinski, p. 4 Development Gustavus Adolphus (centre) leading a mixed-cavalry charge, 1634 According to John Cruso in his cavalry manual of 1632, the harquebusier was \\"first invented in France\\".Tincey (2002), p. 18. This type of cavalryman was characterised by the use of a form of carbine, the earliest type of carbine used was called a \\"harquebus\\" (a word derived from the heavier infantry weapon, the arquebus). In the late 16th century and into the first decades of the following century the harquebusier was envisioned, like the similar and earlier petronel, as a support for more heavily armoured cavalry, demi-lancers or pistol-armed cuirassiers and reiters.Brzezinski, p. 3 Later, towards the mid 17th century, the harquebusier became the standard type of cavalry found throughout western Europe. The switch of the harquebusier from a mounted support role, reliant on firearms, to one of shock-capable close combat cavalry can be attributed to Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in the 1620s and 1630s. Initially, this was from necessity; Sweden was a relatively poor nation and could not afford to equip many expensive cuirassiers, therefore more lightly equipped cavalry had to be employed in a shock role. The success of Swedish cavalry in battle during the Thirty Years War led to other nations adopting their methods.Brzezinski, p. 4 Gustavus Adolphus also reduced the number of ranks in a cavalry formation from the previously usual six to ten, for pistol-based tactics, to three to suit his sword-based shock tactics.Blackmore, pp. 9-10 The later harquebusier was used in a shock role by cavalry leaders of the English Civil War, such as Prince Rupert of the Rhine and Oliver Cromwell. They employed harquesbusiers very aggressively: charging with sword in hand, thus relegating their firearms to a secondary function.Tincey (1990), p. 5. Indeed by the 1620s cavalry not equipped with a carbine could be termed \\"harquebusiers\\", just from the level and style of their armour protection. By the time of the English Civil War all cavalry not equipped as cuirassiers or carrying a lance, the Scots fielded light lancers as late as the 1650s, were called harquebusiers. In the course of the war the cuirassier ceased to be fielded in Britain, and when the cuirassier discarded his limb armour he instantly became indistinguishable from the harquebusier.Brzezinski, pp. 4‚Äì5.Blackmore, pp. 7-10 Equipment Snaphaunce carbine, English-made very high quality harquebusier armour of Pedro II of Portugal: an engraved cuirass, bridle-hand gauntlet, buff coat, and 3-barred lobster tailed pot helmet The harquebusier would usually have been armed with a carbine, wheellock, snaphaunce or doglock flintlock, hung from a swivel attached to a baldric, pistols in saddle holsters, and a stout, straight- bladed, sword.Tincey (1990), pp. 11-16 The 'dog' of the doglock was a type of safety-catch, very useful to prevent the unintentional firing of the carbine when on horseback. Records also indicate that some harquebusiers were also armed with a horseman's poleaxe or pick, these were hafted weapons with axe or hammer heads and armour-piercing spikes.Blackmore, p. 44 The typical harquebusier would have an iron cuirass with a breast and backplate, and an open faced helmet such as a lobster-tailed pot; the fashion conscious could replace the helmet with a broad-brimmed felt hat, often worn over a concealed iron skullcap or secrete. In England, in 1629, a harquebusier's armour cost one pound and six shillings, that of a cuirassier four pounds and ten shillings.Haythornthwaite (1983), pp. 45 and 49. A more wealthy harquebusier may have worn a buff coat (the finest quality buff coats were often more expensive than an iron cuirass) under his armour and a metal gauntlet to protect his bridle hand and forearm.Blackmore, pp. 17-19 Also worn were tall, cuff-topped riding boots; these reached the thigh and were often also of buff leather.Tincey (2002), p. 18 Munition-quality (mass-produced) armour at this time was usually of iron, sometimes containing small amounts of phosphorus; this addition gave a minimal increase in hardness. Officers and other wealthy men would have had access to steel armour, which was carefully heat treated to harden it.Alan Williams, (2003) The Knight and The Blast Furnace, BrillS.Leevera, D.Visser, W.Kockelmann, J.Dika, An archaeometallurgical study of two harquebusier breastplates using time-of-flight neutron diffraction, Physica B: Condensed Matter, Volumes 385‚Äì386, Part 1, 15 November 2006, Pages 542-544 Organisation Harquebusiers were organised into troops, and a variable number of troops made up a regiment. The organisation of the cavalry of the New Model Army in England was typical: each troop was ideally composed of 100 cavalrymen, commanded by a captain, with 6 troops making a regiment under a colonel. Regiments were usually named after their colonel, and both the colonel and his second in command, the major or sergeant major, personally led their own troop. When the regimental colonel was also a general or had other duties, a 'stand-in' termed a lieutenant-colonel was appointed. Numbers of cavalrymen per troop were often lower than the ideal when on campaign and some regiments had more troops than was normal. Prominent commanders also often had a 'lifeguard'; Prince Rupert had a 10 troop regiment plus a lifeguard of 150 men, whilst Oliver Cromwell's regiment had 14 troops.Tincey (2002), pp. 23-24 Tactics German drill manual for early 17th century harquebusiers National variation in the battlefield employment of harquebusiers existed. The French tended to retain greater use of firearms, often their harquebusiers would give a volley of carbine and or pistol fire before closing with the sword. The Swedes and Royalist English charged home directly with the sword, not using firearms until the melee. The Parliamentarian cavalry retained the use of firearms in the charge until later in the Civil War, but by the time of the New Model Army had largely adopted the direct charge with the sword.Haythornthwaite (1983), pp. 51-52. The Royalists, under Prince Rupert's direction, began the Civil War using the Swedish three ranks-deep formation but the Parliamentarians retained a six- deep formation until late 1643 or early 1644. A cavalry unit drawn up in a shallow formation would outflank a similar sized unit arrayed in a deep formation, a considerable tactical advantage.Tincey (2002), p. 26 The Swedes and Royalist cavaliers usually charged at speed, the English Parliamentarian Ironsides charged at a slower pace, troopers keeping together knee-to-knee, in order to retain their formation.Blackmore, pp. 9-10Tincey (2002), pp. 29-31 In England many harquebusiers did not employ a carbine, as is described in Militaire Discipline of 1661: \\"Many troops and regiments only with sword and pistol armed, their encounterings being not after the ancient manner of firing at a distance and wheeling off, which hath been found to be of dangerous consequence, but to fire at near distance their swords hanging at their wrists by a string, and with their sword points charging through adverse troops.\\"Blackmore, p. 9 Demise Victorian painting of a harquebusier. The image is intended to show a soldier of the late 17th century, though the equipment is more typical of early 17th: a wheelock carbine, a cuirass over a buff coat, and an old-fashioned burgonet helmet. The term harquebusier fell out of use gradually, as armour use declined and the 'fully armoured cuirassier' disappeared. Harquebusiers became part of the undifferentiated \\"horse\\" or, in French, \\"cavalerie\\", of the early and mid 18th century. In the British army many cavalry regiments having their origins as units of harquebusiers eventually transformed into dragoons. In the last two decades of the 17th century use of armour and the buff coat declined and helmets were more definitively replaced by felt hats, and uniform coats were widely adopted. As an example, all items of armour previously employed by the regiment of Oxford Blues (precursor of the Royal Horse Guards) were ordered to be put in store in 1688 before the regiment went on active service.Tincey (2002), p. 58 The equipment of the harquebusier disappeared at different rates; the doglock carbine was replaced by the 'true' flintlock in the late 17th century. Cuirasses fell in and out of fashion during the 18th century before the Napoleonic renaissance of the later type of cuirassier in the first decade of the 19th century. The lobster tailed pot helmet fell out of favour in most countries by 1700, though the Austrian army retained this type of helmet for its cuirassiers into the 1780s, especially when campaigning against the Turks.Haythornthwaite (1994), p. 16  See also  * Dragoon * Petronel * Carabinier Notes References *Blackmore, D.

Nuclear energy policy is a national and international policy concerning some or all aspects of nuclear energy and the nuclear fuel cycle, such as uranium mining, ore concentration, conversion, enrichment for nuclear fuel, generating electricity by nuclear power, storing and reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, and disposal of radioactive waste. Nuclear energy policies often include the regulation of energy use and standards relating to the nuclear fuel cycle. Other measures include efficiency standards, safety regulations, emission standards, fiscal policies, and legislation on energy trading, transport of nuclear waste and contaminated materials, and their storage. Governments might subsidize nuclear energy and arrange international treaties and trade agreements about the import and export of nuclear technology, electricity, nuclear waste, and uranium. Since about 2001 the term nuclear renaissance has been used to refer to a possible nuclear power industry revival, but nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999.The Nuclear Renaissance (by the World Nuclear Association) Following the March 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents, China, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Malaysia, Thailand, United Kingdom, and the Philippines are reviewing their nuclear power programs.

Taking stock of nuclear renaissance that never was Sydney Morning Herald, August 18, 2010. As of June 2011, countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Israel, Malaysia, and Norway have no nuclear power stations and remain opposed to nuclear power. Since nuclear energy and nuclear weapons technologies are closely related, military aspirations can act as a factor in energy policy decisions. The fear of nuclear proliferation influences some international nuclear energy policies. The global picture The number of nuclear power plant constructions started each year, from 1954 to 2013. Note the increase in new constructions from 2007 to 2010, before a decline following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. After 1986's Chernobyl disaster, public fear of nuclear power led to a virtual halt in reactor construction, and several countries decided to phase out nuclear power altogether.Research and Markets: International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power Reuters, May 6, 2009. However, increasing energy demand was believed to require new sources of electric power, and rising fossil fuel prices coupled with concerns about greenhouse gas emissions (see Climate change mitigation) have sparked heightened interest in nuclear power and predictions of a nuclear renaissance. In 2004, the largest producer of nuclear energy was the United States with 28% of worldwide capacity, followed by France (18%) and Japan (12%). In 2007, 31 countries operated nuclear power plants.Mycle Schneider, Steve Thomas, Antony Froggatt, Doug Koplow (August 2009). The World Nuclear Industry Status Report , German Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety, p. 6. In September 2008 the IAEA projected nuclear power to remain at a 12.4% to 14.4% share of the world's electricity production through 2030. In 2013, almost two years after Fukushima, according to the IAEA there are 390 operating nuclear generating units throughout the world, more than 10% less than before Fukushima, and exactly the same as in Chernobyl-year 1986.Historic Move: IAEA Shifts 47 Japanese Reactors Into ‚ÄúLong-Term Shutdown‚Äù Category, World Nuclear Industry Status Report, 16-1-2013 Asia is expected to be the primary growth market for nuclear energy in the foreseeable future, despite continued uncertainty in the energy outlooks for Japan, South Korea, and others in the region. As of 2014, 63% of all reactors under construction globally are in Asia.Multilateral Cooperation in Asia's Nuclear Sector, 2014 Pacific Energy Summit Working Paper, 8-6-14 Policy issues =Nuclear concerns= Nuclear accidents and radioactive waste disposal are major concerns. Other concerns include nuclear proliferation, the high cost of nuclear power plants, and nuclear terrorism.Brian Martin. Opposing nuclear power: past and present, Social Alternatives, Vol. 26, No. 2, Second Quarter 2007, pp. 43-47. =Energy security= For some countries, nuclear power affords energy independence. In the words of the French, \\"We have no coal, we have no oil, we have no gas, we have no choice.\\" Japan‚Äîsimilarly lacking in indigenous natural resources for power supply‚Äîrelied on nuclear power for 1/3 of its energy mix prior to the Fukushima nuclear disaster; since March 2011, Japan has sought to offset the loss of nuclear power with increased reliance on imported liquefied natural gas, which has led to the country's first trade deficits in decades.http://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=352 How Can Japan Compete in a Changing Global Market?, Clara Gillispie, The National Bureau of Asian Research, July 201 Therefore, the discussion of a future for nuclear energy is intertwined with a discussion of energy security and the use of energy mix, including renewable energy development. Nuclear power has been relatively unaffected by embargoes, and uranium is mined in \\"reliable\\" countries, including Australia and Canada. =Nuclear energy history and trends= Olkiluoto 3 under construction in 2009. It is the first EPR design, but problems with workmanship and supervision have created costly delays which led to an inquiry by the Finnish nuclear regulator STUK. In December 2012, Areva estimated that the full cost of building the reactor will be about ‚Ç¨8.5 billion, or almost three times the original delivery price of ‚Ç¨3 billion. Proponents have long made inflated projections of the expected growth of nuclear power, but major accidents and high costs have kept growth much lower. In 1973 and 1974, the International Atomic Energy Agency predicted a worldwide installed nuclear capacity of 3,600 to 5,000 gigawatts by 2000. The IAEA's 1980 projection was for 740 to 1,075 gigawatts of installed capacity by the year 2000. Even after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the Nuclear Energy Agency forecasted an installed nuclear capacity of 497 to 646 gigawatts for the year 2000. The actual capacity in 2000 was 356 gigawatts. Moreover, construction costs have often been much higher, and times much longer than projected, failing to meet optimistic projections of ‚Äúunlimited cheap, clean, and safe electricity.‚Äù Since about 2001 the term nuclear renaissance has been used to refer to a possible nuclear power industry revival, driven by rising fossil fuel prices and new concerns about meeting greenhouse gas emission limits. However, nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999, and new reactors under construction in Finland and France, which were meant to lead a nuclear renaissance, have been delayed and are running over- budget.James Kanter. Is the Nuclear Renaissance Fizzling? Green, 29 May 2009.James Kanter. In Finland, Nuclear Renaissance Runs Into Trouble New York Times, May 28, 2009.Rob Broomby. Nuclear dawn delayed in Finland BBC News, 8 July 2009. China has 32 new reactors under construction,Nuclear Power in China and there are also a considerable number of new reactors being built in South Korea, India, and Russia. At the same time, at least 100 older and smaller reactors will \\"most probably be closed over the next 10-15 years\\". So the expanding nuclear programs in Asia are balanced by retirements of aging plants and nuclear reactor phase-outs. In March 2011 the nuclear emergencies at Japan's Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and shutdowns at other nuclear facilities raised questions among some commentators over the future of the renaissance.Nuclear Renaissance Threatened as Japan‚Äôs Reactor Struggles Bloomberg, published March 2011, accessed 2011-03-14Analysis: Nuclear renaissance could fizzle after Japan quake Reuters, published 2011-03-14, accessed 2011-03-14Japan nuclear woes cast shadow over U.S. energy policy Reuters, published 2011-03-13, accessed 2011-03-14Nuclear winter? Quake casts new shadow on reactors MarketWatch, published 2011-03-14, accessed 2011-03-14 Platts has reported that \\"the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world\\". In 2011 Siemens exited the nuclear power sector following the Fukushima disaster and subsequent changes to German energy policy, and supported the German government's planned energy transition to renewable energy technologies. China, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Malaysia, Thailand, United Kingdom, Italy and the Philippines have reviewed their nuclear power programs. Indonesia and Vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants. Countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Portugal, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Norway remain opposed to nuclear power. Following the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity built by 2035. The World Nuclear Association has reported that ‚Äúnuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the Japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year‚Äù. Data from the International Atomic Energy Agency showed that nuclear power plants globally produced 2346 TWh of electricity in 2012 ‚Äì seven per cent less than in 2011. The figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 Japanese power reactors producing no power during the year. The permanent closure of eight reactor units in Germany was also a factor. Problems at Crystal River, Fort Calhoun and the two San Onofre units in the USA meant they produced no power for the full year, while in Belgium Doel 3 and Tihange 2 were out of action for six months. Compared to 2010, the nuclear industry produced 11% less electricity in 2012. =Reactions to Fukushima= Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its reactors and pledged to close the rest by 2022. The Italians have voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear. Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors. Japan‚Äôs prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in Japan‚Äôs reliance on nuclear power. Taiwan‚Äôs president did the same. Mexico has sidelined construction of 10 reactors in favor of developing natural-gas-fired plants. Belgium is considering phasing out its nuclear plants, perhaps as early as 2015. China‚Äînuclear power‚Äôs largest prospective market‚Äîsuspended approvals of new reactor construction while conducting a lengthy nuclear-safety review.Will China's nuclear nerves fuel a boom in green energy? Channel 4, published 2011-03-17, accessed 2011-03-17 Neighboring India, another potential nuclear boom market, has encountered effective local opposition, growing national wariness about foreign nuclear reactors, and a nuclear liability controversy that threatens to prevent new reactor imports. There have been mass protests against the French-backed 9900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Maharashtra and the 2000 MW Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu. The state government of West Bengal state has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 MW facility near the town of Haripur that intended to host six Russian reactors. There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency GlobeScan, commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs. > Just 22% agreed that \\"nuclear power is relatively safe and an important > source of electricity, and we should build more nuclear power plants\\". In > contrast, 71% thought their country \\"could almost entirely replace coal and > nuclear energy within 20 years by becoming highly energy-efficient and > focusing on generating energy from the Sun and wind\\". Globally, 39% want to > continue using existing reactors without building new ones, while 30% would > like to shut everything down now. Policies by territory Following the March 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents, China, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Malaysia, Thailand, United Kingdom, and the Philippines are reviewing their nuclear power programs. Indonesia and Vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants. Countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, New Zealand, and Norway remain opposed to nuclear power.

Controversy In Free Inquiry's April‚ÄìMay 2006 issue, the magazine published four of the cartoons that had originally appeared in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten and that had sparked violent worldwide Muslim protests. Kurtz, editor-in-chief of Free Inquiry said, \\"What is at stake is the precious right of freedom of expression\\". The Borders Group refused to carry this issue in their Borders and Waldenbooks stores because of the cartoons. The reason given by Borders for their decision was not sensitivity to religion but fear of violence.Borders, Waldenbooks Won't Carry Magazine, Carolyn Thompson, Associated Press Writer, March 29, 2006 The story made national and international news and the implications of this self-censorship were widely discussed, including by CBS News, the Washington Post,Two Chains Reject Magazine With Muhammad Cartoons, Associated Press, March 30, 2006 and the New York Times. The \\"blogosphere\\" widely condemned the decision of Borders to ban the magazine and columnist Christopher Hitchens lamented the action in an article.

Greisen is formed by self-generated alteration of a granite and is a class of endoskarn. Greisens appear as highly altered rocks, partly coarse, crystalline granite, partly vuggy with miarolitic cavities, disseminated halide minerals such as fluorite, and occasionally metallic oxide and sulfide ore minerals, borate minerals (tourmaline) and accessory phases such as sphene, beryl or topaz. Petrogenesis Greisens are formed by endoskarn alteration of granite during the cooling stages of emplacement. Greisen fluids are formed by granites as the last highly gas- and water-rich phases of complete crystallisation of granite melts. This fluid is forced into the interstitial spaces of the granite and pools at the upper margins, where boiling and alteration occur. =Alteration facies = * Incipient greisen (granite): muscovite ¬± chlorite, tourmaline, and fluorite. * Greisenized granite: quartz-muscovite-topaz- fluorite, ¬± tourmaline (original texture of granites retained). * Massive greisen: quartz-muscovite-topaz ¬± fluorite ¬± tourmaline (typically no original texture preserved). Tourmaline can be ubiquitous as disseminations, concentrated or diffuse clots, or late fracture fillings. Greisen may form in any wallrock environment, typical assemblages developed in aluminosilicates. Greisen environments Greisens appear to be restricted to intrusions which are emplaced high in the crust, generally at a depth between 0.5 and 5 km, with upper aureoles which are sealed shut to prevent fluids escaping. This is generally required, as the boiling to produce greisenation cannot occur deeper than about 5 kilometres. They are also generally associated only with potassic igneous rocks; S-type granite, not I-type granodiorite or diorite. Greisens are prospective for mineralisation because the last fluids of granite crystallization tend to concentrate incompatible elements such as tin, tungsten, molybdenum and fluorine, as well as metals such as gold, silver, and occasionally copper. Tectonically, greisen granites are generally associated with generation of S-type suites of granites in thick arc and back-arc fold belts where subducted sedimentary and felsic rock is melted. Distribution Examples of greisen are: * Tin and tungsten deposits of Cornwall * Ardlethan, Lachlan Fold Belt, Australia (tin-antimony greisen) * Timbarra, Lachlan Fold Belt, Australia (gold greisen deposit) * Anchor Mine, Tasman Fold Belt, Australia (tin greisen) * Pitinga topaz granite, Brazil (tin, topaz, beryl) * Lost River, Alaska, USA (tin greisen) * Sisson Brook, Burnt Hill and other deposits, New Brunswick, Canada (tin-tungsten-molybdenum greisen) * Erzgebirge, Czech Republic (tin greisen) * Tungsten deposit at Panasqueira Mine, Portugal See also  ; specifically for S-type and I-type distinction * References *Evans, A.M., 1993.

The Grand Canal permits the navigation of more than 30,000 boats a year between Basel and Strasbourg. Construction of the canal began in 1932 and was completed in 1959. The canal diverts much of the water from the original bed of the fast-flowing Rhine in this area, which is almost entirely unnavigable by boats. The Grand Canal produces hydroelectric power at Kembs, Ottmarsheim, Fessenheim and Vogelgrun, supplying electricity to one of the most heavily industrialized regions in France and even to Germany.

Carl and Minette Dixon opened the park to over 5,000 guests on June 1, 1925. They named it after the Native American word Winnepesaukah, meaning \\"bountiful waters\\" or \\"beautiful lake of the highlands\\". The park originally featured the largest swimming pool in the southeastern United States, which debuted in 1926 and was later removed. Its Boat Chute attraction, designed by Carl Dixon and opened in 1927, is the oldest mill chute water ride of its kind still in operation in the United States. In its early years, the park's primary focus was on its water attractions. Later, the park began expanding its dry amusement ride offerings with the introduction of its historic carousel and well-known Cannon Ball roller coaster in the late 1960s. Lake Winnie has grown to over , featuring 38 rides and a water park with seven attractions. History In 1924, Carl and Minette Dixon purchased approximately surrounding a lake in Rossville, Georgia. They opened the park on May 30, 1925, entertaining over 5,000 visitors with amenities for boating, fishing, and picnicking. It was named Lake Winnepesaukah in reference to a Native American word that means \\"bountiful waters\\" or \\"beautiful lake of the highlands\\". The following year, they opened a swimming pool, the largest in the southeastern United States at the time. Carl Dixon later designed a mill chute attraction which began construction in the winter of 1926 and opened as Boat Chute in 1927. The National Amusement Park Historical Association (NAPHA) considers it the oldest operating mill chute in the United States. In the 1940s and 1950s, several flat rides were added to the park, and in the 1960s, the first roller coasters appeared beginning with Mad Mouse in 1960 and the John C. Allen wooden roller coaster, the Cannon Ball, in 1967. In the 21st century, the park saw the addition of modern thrill rides such as the drop tower ride OH-Zone! and a compact, looping roller coaster called Fire Ball. The latest addition is the park's SoakYa water park, a expansion that debuted in 2013. Attractions Lake Winnepesaukah is modeled after a classic American fair theme with a midway layout featuring food, games, and amusement rides. The park's venue is the \\"Jukebox Junction,\\" an open air theater that is used for concerts and as a playground for children. The park expanded in 2013 with the addition of a water park called Soak Ya with several water attractions. The park also featured the only known working Eyerly Fly-O-Plane attraction in the United States until it closed in 2017. Family-oriented rides include the Wacky Factory, tilt-a-whirl, matterhorn, balloon race, paratrooper, orbiter, pirate ship, scrambler, a Ferris wheel, Genie, Fire Ball, bumper cars, paddle boats, a tour train, and several other family and thrill rides. In 2005, several rides from an amusement park in Panama City Beach, Florida, were brought to Lake Winnie for its 80th birthday celebration. After the revival of Miracle Strip closed down, several of its rides permanently relocated to Lake Winnespesaukah, including The Bumble Bees, The Free Whale, Kiddie Boats and The Ferris Wheel. =Other notable rides= Wild Lightnin' This coaster is a Wild Mouse Ride provided by L&T; Systems. Genie This is a Hrubetz Super Roundup, and a favorite among guests. This ride originally sat at the front of the park, featuring a special backdrop and a rainbow paint job. In the 2002-2003 off-season, the backdrop was changed. After years of flawless operations, a storm in the 2016-2017 off-season made a tree collapse on the ride, causing extreme damage; the ride was removed and replaced by a Moser Rides Asymmetrical Maverick known as the Twister; this ride has an unusual height requirement of 57\\". The next season, the Genie returned with a fresh paint job and no backdrop, in the former place of the Fly-O-Plane, which was removed permanently after an accident in 2017. https://www.wrcbtv.com/story/32462280/update-two-children-injured-on-lake- winnie-ride Boat chute The first ride at Lake Winnepesaukah ‚Äì and still one of the most popular at the park ‚Äì is the Boat Chute, which opened in 1927. According to the National Amusement Park Historical Association (NAPHA), it is the oldest Mill Chute attraction still in operation in the United States. Cannon Ball The Cannon Ball The Cannon Ball is a wooden roller coaster from legendary designer John Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. Built in 1967, the roller coaster features a drop and of track that spans three quarters of a mile. The ride lasts 90 seconds and has a top speed of . Signifying the park's location adjacent to the Georgia-Tennessee state line, the American, Georgia, and Tennessee flags are at the top of the lift hill. =Carousel= The oldest ride at the park is the Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel number 39, manufactured in 1916. Among the oldest and largest in the country, the carrousel includes 68 hand-painted steeds. OH- ZONE! The OH-ZONE! is a , 14-story tall Drop tower ride in which seated riders experience free-fall followed by a 4.6G deceleration upon return to ground level. The 2006 installation of the ride required the Fly-O-Plane to be relocated to another section of the park adjacent to the Cannon Ball roller coaster. Zoom Flume Once known as the Pipeline Plunge, these two water slides were refurbished before the 2016 season, receiving new tubing; the entrance was placed inside of the SoakYa Water Park and is now considered part of the water park. Wacky Worm Intended primarily for children, the Wacky Worm is a metal roller coaster with a ride vehicle resembling a smiling green worm. The ride has a maximum height of less than and consists of several turns and short \\"bunny hop\\" hills. Incidents On April 19, 2003, a crowd disturbance described as a \\"near-riot\\" involving 500 to 700 youths took place outside the park after management decided to close the park 90 minutes early. Catoosa County Sheriff Phil Summers claimed the incident was caused by parents leaving their children unattended at the park with little or no money, thus unable to participate in the park's activities. When sporadic fighting began in the crowd, the decision was made to close the park early, which escalated the fighting. Law enforcement agencies from Georgia and Tennessee were dispatched to the scene when the crowd began to disrupt traffic on roads surrounding the park. After the incident, the park instituted a new policy of requiring visitors under 16 years of age to be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Visitors also will be required to buy some sort of admission. In February 2019, there was a rumor from a Facebook post claiming Cardi B would be doing a concert at Lake Winnie on Saturday April 20, 2019. However, that event was fake considering Lake Winnie officially opened on Thursday May 2, 2019 and Lake Winnie was not expecting a Cardi B concert.

The group consisted of Gustave Lund (Gurra G), Wille Crafoord (Doktor C) and Peder Ernerot (Pedda P). They had several chart successes during the early-mid 1990s.Swedish album chart positions Swedish singles chart positions Their contribution to the Swedish hip hop scene is significant because they were the first successful Swedish language rap act. Their dominance in the Swedish charts during the early 1990s opened up a new market in the Swedish music scene for artists who wished to record rap music in Swedish. Previously, prior to the success of Just D, Swedish rap artists used English rhymes in a bid to succeed in the international market. Just D showed that local chart success with Swedish rhymes was a lucrative market in and of itself. Their first album were heavily influenced by De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising but after a few years the groups sound changed and they were marketed like the early incarnation of the Beastie Boys and they had the same impact on Sweden's popular music audience. They applied American hip hop rhythm & rhyme to Swedish pop music and their formula made hip hop trendy and palatable to new audiences. JustD's presentation of rap music had a certain irony and some might say parody to it. In their early albums, they also tended heavily to use Swedish record samples. In contrast to the majority of Swedish hip hop artists in the 1990s, none of the members in JustD had an immigrant background. The members of Just D came from affluent homes, and Wille Crafoord is a member of the archaic Swedish nobility. However, when the next wave of Swedish language rap music came, Swedish audiences had become ready for the rhymes of The Latin Kings, Infinite Mass, Petter, Blues and Feven.

Biography Hans Georg Nilsen B√∏rli was born at Eidskog in Hedmark, Norway. He was the fifth of seven children born to Nils Thorkildsen B√∏rli (1883‚Äì1951) and Marie Bolette Olsdatter B√∏rli (1881‚Äì1962). B√∏rli was raised on a small farm in a road-less area in the forests of Eidskog Kommune. The experience of poverty and hardship would leave a deep imprint on his later art. However, the positive effects of living close to nature, the wisdom of tradition and the solidarity between workers also had a significant bearing on his writings. A strict Christian pietism upbringing would leave B√∏rli forever struggling with the counteractive forces of rebellion and a deeply embedded sense of religious longing. B√∏rli was considered a gifted boy and was admitted to Talhaug Mercantile School in Kongsvinger. He later was admitted to a military academy in Oslo, but his education was ended by the outbreak of the Second World War. B√∏rli fought against the invading German Army, was involved in some intense battles in Vardal, and was captured in Verdal. After being released, he went back to Eidskog and worked as a teacher and forest worker for the remaining of the war. During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was also involved in illegal activities including guiding refugees across the Swedish border. His first collection of poetry, Tyrield was published in 1945. Until the mid-1950s, he published books almost annually, both poetry and prose. His writings were a characteristic blend of traditional and free form, romance and realism, perversion, seriousness, social awareness and religious quest. Ole Gundersen B√∏rli (1860‚Äì1945), his mother's father was considered one of the last great oral narrator of legends and stories of the area. He was considered an important influence on the young writer-to-be. Hans B√∏rli was by his own account also heavily influenced by the writings of poet Olav H. Hauge (1908-1994). Hans B√∏rli died in 1989 at 70 years of age and was buried at Eidskog Church.

They are mostly pale white and small ( long) crustaceans, although Limnoria stephenseni from subantarctic waters can reach . Classification The term \\"gribble\\" was originally assigned to the wood-boring species, especially the first species described from Norway by Jens Rathke in 1799, Limnoria lignorum. The Limnoriidae are now known to include seaweed and seagrass borers, as well as wood borers. Those gribbles able to bore into living marine plants are thought to have evolved from a wood (dead plant) boring species. Ecology Gribbles bore into wood and plant material for ingestion as food. The cellulose of wood is digested, most likely with the aid of cellulases produced by the gribbles themselves. The most destructive species are Limnoria lignorum, L. tripunctata and L. quadripunctata. Due to dispersal while inhabiting wooden ships, it is uncertain where these three mentioned species originated. Limnoriidae are second only to the Teredinidae in the amount of destruction caused to marine timber structures such as jetties and piers. L. tripunctata is unusually tolerant of creosote, a preservative often used to protect timber piles, due to symbiosis with creosote-degrading bacteria. Gribbles bore the surface layers of wood, unlike the Teredinidae which attack more deeply. Their burrows are 1‚Äì2 mm diameter, may be several centimetres long, and have the burrow‚Äôs roof punctured with a series of smaller ventilation holes. Attacked wood can become spongy and friable. Gribbles play an ecologically important role, by helping to degrade and recycle driftwood. Most seaweed boring gribbles attack holdfasts and their activities can cause the seaweed to come adrift especially during storms. For defence, gribbles can jam themselves within their burrows using their uropods and block the tunnel with their rear disc-shaped segment, the pleotelson. A number of crustaceans have evolved as commensals with Limnoriidae. Chelura are amphipods that inhabit the more severely attacked regions of gribble-attacked wood. Donsiella are tiny copepods that inhabit the brood pouch and body of Limnoriidae. As a source of biofuel It has been suggested that the enzymes used by Limnoriidae to break down wood may be useful for producing sugar from non-food biomass, such as wood or straw, in a sustainable way. This could then be used to produce alternative fuels. \\"Enzymes produced by the tiny creatures are able to break down woody cellulose and turn it into energy-rich sugars meaning that gribble could convert wood and straw into liquid biofuel.\\" One particular enzyme produced in a special organ in the body of the gribble called the hepatopancreas and secreted into its gut has recently been identified and characterized: the GH7 cellobiohydrolase, LqCel7B. This enzyme has been shown to be highly effective in a salty environment such as that in which the gribble lives.
