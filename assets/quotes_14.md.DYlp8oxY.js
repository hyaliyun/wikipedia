The community is considered the largest tax payer in Clark County, Nevada. The complex previously included the Stirling Club, offering various amenities to residents. History Turnberry Place consists of four 38-story condominium towers, measuring , with a total of 720 units. The project was announced in June 1998, and the first tower was completed in 2001. Upon its initial opening, Turnberry Place and the nearby Park Towers inspired a condominium boom in the Las Vegas Valley. Subsequent towers at Turnberry Place were completed in 2002 and 2004. The fourth and final tower was topped off in January 2006, and all 180 units in the tower had been sold by that point. The final tower was completed that year. At the time of construction, they were tied for the 10th tallest buildings in Las Vegas. As of 2009, they were the 20th tallest building in the area. It is the largest and tallest condominium complex in the state of Nevada. Stirling Club The Stirling Club was marketed as the centerpiece of Turnberry Place. The private club included a bar and lounge, a swimming pool and spa, tennis courts, a fitness center, and a cigar and wine room. The club also once included a restaurant operated by chef Charlie Palmer. The club opened in 2002, and its operation was funded through $400 monthly HOA membership fees paid by Turnberry Place residents. The club closed because of financial losses in May 2012, resulting in approximately 100 job losses. Turnberry Associates was unable to find an operator to continue running the club. Turnberry Place residents accounted for 80 percent of the club's revenue. The club had 1,300 members, including non-residents who purchased memberships for $2,500. A group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, incorporated as JDLB LLC, purchased the club for more than $10 million in 2013, with plans to eventually reopen it. JDLB never reopened the club, as the executives believed that trying to operate it would take away time from their jobs in Silicon Valley. The club was put up for sale in 2015.

It was limited to 500 copies, and of those 500 copies pressed, 400 are blue vinyl and 100 on grey/beige swirl vinyl. The EP was mastered by Peter Lyman, who did the same for the other EPs and singles by No Age. The EP is one of five limited edition singles and EPs released by No Age on five different labels on the same day, March 26, 2007. There are two covers, one a special edition. The regular cover features a painting done by Amanda Vietta, also responsible for the exterior re-do of The Smell as seen on No Age's Weirdo Rippers. The album has since sold out all 500 copies from Teenage Teardrop's online store. The EP's title song, \\"Dead Plane,\\" was played by No Age when they appeared on an episode of Juan's Basement, which was broadcast on Pitchfork Media's Pitchfork.tv site. \\"Dead Plane\\" was also mentioned in the article about No Age, Let It Rip, by The New Yorker, which gained them substantial fans and increased popularity. In August 2008, a video for Goat Hurt, track two on the EP, was made, for a DVD release on No Age drummer Dean Spunt's label, Post Present Medium entitled New Video Works. At this point the EP was long out of print, so No Age pressed up a limited run of 240 copies for a 3-song 10\\" sold mainly at the F*** Yeah! festival on August 30, 2008. Tracks There are four tracks on the vinyl EP. All the tracks are original. The first track on the record is Dead Plane which, in an April 17, 2008 interview, No Age named as one of their top two favorite songs to play, along with Everybody's Down. The second track on the A-side is Goat Hurt. On the album's B-side are the two tracks Never Not Beaten which precedes You is My Hot Rabbit. Of these four songs on the EP, only the title track went on to be reproduced, as it was the ninth track on No Age's album Weirdo Rippers.

His highest rank was komusubi. He held the record for most consecutive victories from entry into sumo for several years before it was broken by Jōkōryū in 2012. After his retirement, Itai caused controversy by claiming that the outcomes of many of his matches were set by match-fixing. Career He played baseball at elementary school but was converted to sumo at Oita Prefectural Ocean Science High School where his older brother was active in the school's sumo team. Despite being scouted by ex-Yoshibayama of the Miyagino stable and solicitations from the Nihon University and Komazawa University sumo teams, he did not think he could make the grade as a pro. Instead, after graduating from high school he worked in the ceramics industry until he was 22. He was active in his company's sumo division and won many national youth competitions as an amateur. He did not turn professional until September 1978 when he joined Onaruto stable, set up by the former sekiwake Kōtetsuyama Toyoya after he left Asahiyama stable. Itai rose up the rankings in record time, winning his first 26 matches, a record at that time for most consecutive victories from entry into sumo. He reached the second jūryō division just six tournaments after his professional debut, and was given the shikona of Kōtetsuyama, after his stablemaster. He was promoted to the top makuuchi division after winning the jūryō championship in July 1980. However he dropped out of his debut makuuchi tournament on the fifth day without even winning one match. He won promotion to the top division once again after winning another jūryō title in March 1981 but once again dropped out of the following tournament, this time after only three days. Struggling with a left knee injury, he fell all the way down to the unsalaried makushita division. In an effort to change his fortunes, he dropped the shikona and reverted to his real surname, which he was to use for the rest of his career. Itai finally managed to win a top division bout on his third attempt in November 1982, and came through with his first kachi-koshi or winning score in March 1983. He remained in the top division for 50 consecutive tournaments. Although he was short for a sumo wrestler at just , he was a powerful pusher-thruster, specialising in oshi techniques. He earned three gold stars for defeating yokozuna, all of which were bouts against Onokuni. He defeated Onokuni six times in a row from November 1985 until March 1988 (including when Onokuni was at ōzeki rank) and used fierce harite or slaps to the face (reinforced by strapping around his hands) which knocked Onokuni straight to the ground in one match. However by contrast he lost all 16 bouts against yokozuna Chiyonofuji. His best result in a tournament was 11-4 in March 1989, for which he was awarded two special prizes for outstanding performance and technique. At 33 he was the oldest first-time special prize winner since Shionishiki in May 1959. He earned promotion to komusubi for the following tournament, but only managed three wins in his sanyaku debut and never managed to return to the rank. In the July 1991 tournament, ranked at the bottom of the makuuchi division, he lost every one of his fifteen bouts and was demoted to jūryō. He announced his retirement from sumo three days into the following tournament at the age of 35. Unusually, his professional debut, jūryō debut, makuuchi debut and retirement all took place in the Aki basho held in September. Retirement from sumo Itai was unable to purchase or borrow toshiyori kabu, or elder stock upon his retirement and so was unable to remain in the Japan Sumo Association. As a result, his Onaruto stable folded in 1994 when no successor to his old stablemaster could be found. Itai began a new career as a chankonabe restaurant owner. In February 2000, in a lecture to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan and a string of articles published in the tabloid Shukan Gendai magazine, he claimed that during his active career yaocho, or match-fixing was widespread, with up to 80 percent of bouts being prearranged. Wrestlers who had already secured their kachi-koshi would lose deliberately to those still needing wins, in exchange for points to be collected at later tournaments. Wrestlers who had not accumulated points would have to \\"buy\\" victories instead for around $2,000. He said the fixed matches would be arranged through the wrestlers' tsukebito or personal attendants, often in the dressing room shortly before the bout, and \\"was kind of an ordinary thing.\\" Itai claimed the practice was still continuing today, although to a lesser extent. He said he could tell if a match was fixed just by watching it on TV, and accused ōzeki Chiyotaikai and yokozuna Akebono among others of throwing bouts. The Sumo Association strenuously denied the allegations, with its chairman Tokitsukaze Oyakata threatening Itai with legal action unless he withdraw his claims. Itai, who had joined a religious group called the God Light Association in the 1980s, said he was on a \\"mission from God\\" to reveal the truth behind match-fixing. Others pointed out his restaurant business was struggling and he was well paid for his interviews. Itai claimed to have evidence on tape, but it was never produced publicly and the Sumo Association did not in the end go to the courts. In October 2008 in the Tokyo District Court, Itai appeared for the defence in a lawsuit brought by Kitanoumi, the head of the Sumo Association, against the Shukan Gendai magazine over further match-fixing allegations in its March 10, 2007 issue. He repeated his belief that 75–80 percent of matches were fixed during his active days, and he stated that only three yokozuna, Onokuni, Takanohana and Wakanohana had not thrown bouts in recent times. He claimed that he arranged a fixed match with Kitanoumi in the July 1984 tournament, through an intermediary, for 500,000 yen. He also said he was now working in a glass factory and had no other source of income. Death In his later years Itai suffered from diabetes and had a pacemaker fitted. He died on 14 August 2018 after collapsing at his home. He was 62.

Overview HyperSpace includes instant- on/instant-off access to applications, a power savings management system, and a secure environment less prone to viruses, malware and other external attacks that generally target Windows. Users still have access to their most-used applications, such as a Web browser and e-mail, even when Windows or another OS is booting, shutting down, on standby, or has crashed. It can also be used to avoid the security problems associated with using the Windows operating system, or for troubleshooting Windows. HyperSpace can also extend a notebook battery life by 25%.http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2008/11/05/ Potential applications for HyperSpace include Web browsers, instant-on multimedia players, IP soft phones, e-mail, instant messaging, VoIP, remote system maintenance, repair, and embedded security. The operating system will be read- only memory-based and as such may only apply to motherboards which have this operating system embedded. It runs on top of the HyperCore hypervisor. Hybrid versus Dual HyperSpace Hybrid allows a platform to run multiple operating systems (OS) and applications as independent, side-by-side environments.http://www.trustedreviews.com/pcs/news/2007/11/07/HyperSpace- Runs-Applications-While-Windows-Boots/p1 This means one computer system can concurrently run both a Windows and a HyperSpace environment. Users have the ability to switch between the two environments in real time with one simple push of the 'F4' key. HyperSpace Hybrid runs on PCs with Intel Vanderpool Technology (VT).http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2009/012109-cool- tools.html For those without this technology, HyperSpace Dual allows the HyperSpace environment to coexist with another operating system, but the two may not run concurrently.

History The Trans- Panama Pipeline was opened in 1982 as an alternative to carry crude oil from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. In 1980s in average twenty supertankers, each with a capacity of a million barrels of crude oil, arrived each month at Puerto Armuelles from Valdez in Alaska, for transportation to the Caribbean Sea. Between 1982 and 1996 the pipeline transported 2.7 billion barrels of Alaskan oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast ports. After declining Alaskan oil shipments, the pipeline was closed in 1996. In November 2003, the Trans-Panama pipeline was re-opened for transportation of Ecuadorian crude oil to U.S. Gulf ports. In 2005, Venezuela began talks about reverse using the pipeline for its oil exports to China. In May 2008, BP signed an agreement with Petroterminal de Panama S.A., according to which the pipeline was modernized and reversed to ship BP's Angolan and other crude oil to the U.S. West Coast refineries. BP acquired of storage capacities and committed to secure shipments of . On 28 August 2009, Tesoro oil company started reverse oil shipments through the pipeline to supply the Atlantic Basin oil to the Pacific Rim refineries. On 15 October 2009, Petroterminal de Panama S.A. signed a contract with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company to design and construct the second-phase expansion of terminal storage facilities.  Technical features  The pipeline is long and it has a capacity of . Its terminal installations are located in Charco Azul Bay, south of Puerto Armuelles, with three docks constructed to receive supertankers, a system to treat ballast water, and three large tanks with a total capacity of of crude oil. From 1979 to 1982, before construction of the pipeline, these facilities were utilized to transfer petroleum from large supertankers (200,000 tons) to smaller tankers (65,000 tons) that could transit the Panama Canal.  Environmental facts and concerns  Many environmental concerns have been considered by scientists and environmental activists. However, PTP has applied little restraint in construction and operations of the pipeline with consideration to the environment. The pipeline project \\"was approved and completed in 1981–1982 before submission of an environmental impact assessment\\". The environmental studies were seriously flawed by many omissions in the biotic, and socioeconomic baseline. PTP never placed serious attention to the possibility of oil spills and effects on marine or terrestrial ecosystems. For example, \\"studies of petroleum hydrocarbons in the marine ecosystems were not performed\\". Erosion control was minimal and thousands of tons soil were displaced during construction. Many forests, rivers and creeks were damaged or destroyed resulting in negative impact on natural ecosystems. Pipeline construction through the mountains of Fortuna (Boquete and Gualaca) in Central Cordillera was later the base for the construction of the first road from Chiriqui to Bocas del Toro. The road construction was positive in social terms but the environmental impact on virgin forests has resulted in overall biodiversity losses in the Palo Seco Forestal Reserve and buffer area along the coast from Chiriqui Grande to Almirante-Changuinola and Comarca Ngäbe-Bugle. Peace Operator The pipeline is owned and operated by Petroterminal de Panama S.A., a joint venture of the Government of Panama and the NIC Holding Corporation located in the town of Melville, on Long Island (NY). The Government of Panama, currently owning 40% of the company, plans to acquire rest of shares in the company.

Guides published by the Verwaltung der Staatlichen Scholoesser of the Landesamt fuer Denkmalpfege Rheinland-Pfalz. Descriptions prepared by Magnus Backes, translated by John M. Deasy. Second English edition. Mainz, Germany, 2000. Blumenstein castle was probably constructed in the first half of the 13th century as part of a line of defensive castles along the Alsatian border.  History  The castle was first mentioned in 1332 in connection with Lord Anselm of Batzendorf and Blumenstein. After a feud with the House of Fleckenstein in 1347, the knight was banished from the castle. About 1350, the counts of Zweibrücken had one fourth of the castle, the House of Dahn owned the rest. Blumenstein Castle was probably destroyed during the German Peasants' War in 1525. The ruin passed from the counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg to the landgraves of Hesse, then to the Bishopric of Speyer and finally to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The State Office of Castles, Palaces and Antiquities installed safety measures (such as railings along stairways and around the cliff edges) in the 1970s.  Description  \\"Blumenstein Castle, situated in magnificant loneliness, at a height of about 500 meters [1,600 ft], presents, even today, one of the most unspoilt impressions of its kind.\\" ibid, p. 32. The castle sits upon the top of a narrow red sandstone pier about wide and long, about above the hilltop. Parts of the castle, including the narrow stairways, are carved directly into the red sandstone. \\"Prior to the invention of firearms, it was hardly possible to capture this picturesque castle hidden in the middle of the forest. It was necessary to siege it and starve its inhabitants out.\\"ibid, p.32  References   Literature   Friedrich Knöpp: Territorialbestand der Grafschaft Hanau-Lichtenberg hessen-darmstädtischen Anteils.

The native Monterey Pine ecosystem is one of the rarest forest ecosystems in the world. Only a few thousand acres of the endemic trees exist in four locations along the Pacific Ocean on the Central Coast of California. The Monterey Peninsula is home to the largest of these stands, but these trees are threatened by development, non-native invasive species, and diseases. The City of Monterey itself maintains more than 19,000 trees, in parks and along streets, and about of Monterey Pine forest. Monterey currently spends nearly $1 million annually on its urban forestry program, or about $33 per citizen. Carmel spends about $450,000, which with its smaller population translates to about $112 per citizen. LMP Class of 2008 Reforestation Project Pine Forests on the Monterey Peninsula A patchwork pine forests grow across the Monterey Peninsula in California, creating a rich green habitat that delights residents and visitors alike. Although the locally native Monterey Pine - Pinus radiata tree species is widely grown in landscapes and on plantations in the Western Hemisphere of Northern America, the native Monterey Pine ecosystem is one of the rarest forest ecosystems in the world. Only a few thousand acres of the endemic trees exist in four locations along the Pacific Ocean on the Central Coast of California. The Monterey Peninsula is home to the largest of these stands, but the trees there are threatened by impacts from development, non- native invasive species, and disease.Leadership Monterey Peninsula Class Projects, \\"Small-Scale Reforestation in an Urban Forest\\" The local Monterey pine forest provides numerous benefits to the region's economy, from its intrinsic beauty that attracts tourists, to recreational settings for residents and visitors, to valuable ecological services, such as watershed protection and enhanced air quality. However, except for a few small sites and the Point Lobos State Reserve, much of the remaining forest is not protected within conservation areas. According to The Monterey Pine Forest Watch, “Half of our native forest has already been removed” and “Much of the remaining forest is in private hands and subject to development.”“Our Monterey Pine Forest: A Forest Under Siege,” pg. 3, The Monterey Pine Forest Watch. Urban Forestry Even sites that are protected from tree removal, such as Veteran's Memorial Park, have been impacted by human activities and tree diseases, such as pine pitch canker. According to Robert Reid, the head of the City of Monterey's Urban Forestry program, “Since the disease was first discovered in 1986, hundreds of pines of all ages have died and their loss has had a noticeable impact on the forested areas and landscapes of the Peninsula.”“Monterey Pines Survival,” Robert Reid, City Focus, Volume XXII, Number 1, Spring 2007, p. 5. In the Spring 2007 issue of City Focus, he describes how scientists have been unable to find a cure or stop the spread of the pitch canker fungus: “The infection causes pines to ooze sap, which results in greater susceptibility to attack from destructive pine bark beetles.” The fungus is spread as beetles move from tree to tree. The local city forestry departments have small staffs and are charged with the responsibility of caring for large areas of public lands. In addition, city arborists are called upon to advise on property issues, construction impacts and risk assessment. The City of Monterey itself maintains more than 19,000 trees, in parks and along streets, and about of Monterey Pine forest. Monterey currently spends nearly $1 million annually on its urban forestry program, or about $33 per citizen. Carmel spends about $450,000, which with its smaller population translates to about $112 per citizen. An active volunteer group, Friends of Carmel Forest, supports Carmel's tree planting, surveying and education activities. Carmel's City Council also recently voted to approve a contract with a renowned tree care specialist, Barry Coates, to provide a study of Carmel's forest. The Council also approved spending up to $50,000 to implement changes recommended by the forest study. In the City of Monterey, crews trim an average of more than 1,800 trees and remove 150 annually. In 2005, a total of 338 trees were planted or replaced on City property, and 400 native tree seedlings were donated for planting on private property. In addition, the City of Monterey Urban Forestry Section provides tree maintenance services to the Presidio and Naval Postgraduate School. Given the tremendous workload and the importance of the local forests, volunteer groups such as Leadership Monterey Peninsula are critical partners in maintaining and improving the region's quality of life. Individual City Information Polled in 2007/8 by the Leadership Monterey Peninsula Reforestation Group, the following is a breakdown of the cities in Monterey County, and their reforestation efforts. City of Monterey Current Forestation Activities: As of 2008, the City of Monterey has 9 employees in the Urban Forestry Department. The City of Monterey works with various volunteer groups to plant trees in high-needs areas; there is also a Neighborhood Improvement Program (NIP) in which residents can request that trees be planted in certain residential areas, such as along the side walks. Their budget for tree- planting and maintenance in your city was $1 million, including payroll for 9 staff in 2008. This funding comes from taxes and periodic grants; maintenance through the urban forestry dept. and volunteers. Historical efforts for this department included spring 2003 stats: 768 on city property, 1500 seedlings donated for planting on private property; average number of trees is 300-500 annually. Other that have assisted in reforestation efforts include Leadership Monterey Peninsula, Boy Scouts of America, and schools that have periodically assisted with tree planting projects, as well as Volunteer Gardener Program – this group tends to do more ornamentals and flowers for the city and Monterey Green Action (Yahoo groups) – has volunteers available. City of Carmel Current Forestation Activities: Carmel's Department of Forest and Beach is responsible for the maintenance of and improvements to the urban forest. The majority of their time is spent pruning, planting, watering, treating insects, and removing dead trees. The city's annual budget for tree-planting and maintenance is $458,000 including beach maintenance and all Forest and Beach Departmental services. This department, encompassing three employees, takes care of all the arboricultural needs of over 13,000 trees growing on public property. City of Marina Current Forestation Activities: Marina has been named a \\"Tree City USA\\" community by the Arbor Day Foundation. Had to meet four standards to get this designation: 1) has a tree board or department 2) has a community tree ordinance 3) has a community forestry program w/ an annual budget of at least $2 per capita (budget is $50,554.36; population is 18,824) 4) has an Arbor Day Observance and Proclamation (Dec. 17, 2007) The tree committee has recently been reorganized; it is now a subcommittee of the planning commission. Tree planting activities are now done by a non-profit: \\"Marina Tree and Garden Club\\". Their mission includes \\"Improve the streets and public areas of the city of Marina by planting and cultivating trees and gardens therein\\" The city does not have an arborist or a tree-planting program. City of Seaside Current Forestation Activities: No formal reforestation program. Parks and Recreation Dept has an annual budget of approximately $150,000, and did plant 50+ trees in 2007. A limited number of trees are taken care (watered) of by the city parks department. There is an established relationship with their neighborhood associations to assist with planting of trees within Seaside. City of Del Rey Oaks Current Forestation Activities: Currently looking for Oak tree donations City of Pacific Grove Current Forestation Activities: Pacific Grove's tree planting program is called \\"Trees for Pacific Grove\\", a public private partnership with this non-profit. In 2007, Trees for PG raised over $10,000 through sponsorships. Individuals can become a Seedling Sponsor for $75 or a Sapling Sponsor for $250. During the same time period, Pacific Grove also planted over 1,000 trees and gave away another 500 native trees to local residents to plant on their own property. Sustainable Pacific Grove is another organization interested in tree planting in PG.

The Cathedral was designed by Belgian Architects. Its neoclassical design was said to have been inspired by the look of the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, France. Construction began in 1928 and lasted until 1938. Belgian engineer Pablo Dambach oversaw the construction of the cathedral. The iron that was used to frame the core of the cathedral was shipped directly from Belgium. The cathedral survived the 1931 Nicaragua earthquake, as only its iron core had been erected at the time. Four decades later, the cathedral was heavily damaged during the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake, and the building was subsequently condemned though it was not demolished. The closing of the cathedral eventually led to the construction of the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, also known as the New Cathedral of Managua, which was completed in 1993. Since that time, the restoration of the Old Cathedral has appeared to be possible. The Old Cathedral's tower clock, which was damaged during the Contra Civil War of the 1980s, was later removed during renovations to the cathedral in the late 1990s.

The Showboat opened as a casino hotel in 1987 and closed in 2014; the hotel reopened in 2016. It is owned by developer Bart Blatstein. History On March 30, 1987, the Showboat Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center opened with a casino and a 60-lane bowling alley, The complex was built on land leased from Resorts International, just north of the under-construction Resorts Taj Mahal (which became the Trump Taj Mahal upon opening in 1990, now reopening as the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City). The grand opening ceremony featured Bob Hope and Al Hirt. The Showboat opened the city's first racebook in 1993, following the legalization in 1990 of casino simulcast wagering. Steelman Partners completed a major renovation in 1995, creating a Mardi Gras theme. In 1998, the property's parent company, Showboat, Inc., was purchased by Harrah's Entertainment, now Caesars Entertainment. With the popularity of bowling on the decline, the bowling alley was closed in 2001, and the space was used for a new buffet and a coffee shop. In May 2003, the Showboat added a 544-room, $90 million hotel tower called the Orleans Tower. In 2007, the hotel remodeled its original tower, the Bourbon Tower. In the past decade, many improvements were made to the establishment, including a new hotel tower and a House of Blues on the boardwalk, along with a complete renovation of the boardwalk facade. In June 2014, Caesars Entertainment announced the planned closure of the Showboat, even though the property was profitable. The move was made in an effort to stabilize Caesars's other Atlantic City casinos.\\"Caesars closing Showboat Casino 'to stabilize our business in Atlantic City  Breaking News  pressofatlanticcity.comShowboat closes after 27 years in Atlantic City - News - NorthJersey.com After a buyer could not be found, the Showboat closed on August 31, 2014, at 4:00 p.m. It employed 2,100 people, but 470 of them were immediately hired at other Caesars casinos.https://web.archive.org/web/20140830182513/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/20140829_ap_3fe0a255bdfd4830ae3c3c79ef8c17a2.html The shutdown came amid a wave of closures of Atlantic City properties, with four of the city's casinos closing in 2014.

The \\"new\\" Showboat Atlantic City Hotel opened July 8, accepting reservations and welcoming guests. The new hotel features only one restaurant, bar and coffee shop. The former casino space and House of Blues areas are currently closed indefinitely and decorated with images of Atlantic City. In February 2018, Blatstein took a preliminary step toward applying for a casino license for the property. Blatstein said \\"There is over a billion dollars worth of investment in that part of the town that should not be ignored,\\" referring to the reopening of two shuttered casinos next to the Showboat, the Ocean Resort Casino and Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. In early 2019, Bart Blatstein was approved to apply for a casino license. Blatstein has plans to build a new casino in the lot in between Showboat and Ocean Casino Resort. Due to a deed restriction placed on Showboat by Caesars Entertainment, the building may not be used as a casino, so building a new building is a way around it. The new casino is expected to break ground in 2020. Later that year, Blatstein announced plans to convert 264 of the Showboat's hotel rooms into apartments.

Sultan, an American soldier who was leading the Nicaragua Canal Survey, organized a relief team of 34 soldiers, and was on an emergency committee for responding. He was charged with overseeing the restoration of railroads and water to the city, and chaired a food relief committee that provided 24,000 rations daily by April 24. The American Red Cross initially provided $10,000 towards relief, before increasing the amount to $100,000. People from Mexico and Panama, as well as other Central American countries, were sent to assist in relief and rebuilding efforts. America flew in medical supplies, working to prevent the outbreak of various diseases.  Rebuilding  In March 1932, The New York Times reported that \\"the Nicaraguan capital Is slowly emerging from ruins caused by 1931 earthquake\\". Rents fell by 40% in the year following the earthquake, and the city had slowly been rebuilding. Efforts were hampered by a lack of funding. The city was eventually rebuilt in the Spanish Colonial architecture style.

A two- story retail project had initially been planned for the site in 2001, although it ultimately did not materialize. Plans for Sky Las Vegas were announced in July 2004, with construction beginning the following year and its opening occurring in May 2007. History Original plans In February 2001, NewMark Merrill – a developer of strip malls in southern California – announced plans to purchase a property on the Las Vegas Strip. The property, located north of the Circus Circus resort and south of a planned Hilton timeshare high-rise, was owned by Bill Bennett, who also owned the nearby Sahara Hotel and Casino. NewMark Merrill was planning a two-story, retail project for the property that would be known as the Boulevard Collection. The project was designed by Lee & Sakahara, and was to be opened in 2004. After the September 11 attacks, Hilton halted construction of its nearby timeshare project, and NewMark subsequently had difficulty securing tenants because of concerns about the lack of new development at the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. Announcement and construction Nevada Development Partners purchased the vacant property from NewMark Merrill in March 2004, at a cost of $13.5 million. The company was made up of Aaron Yashouafar, the chief executive of the Los Angeles-based Milbank Real Estate Services Inc.; and David Pourbaba and Neil Kadisha, developers from southern California. In July 2004, plans were announced for Sky Las Vegas, a 40-story, 350-unit condominium tower. Construction was expected to commence in the first quarter of 2005, and was expected to cost $300 million. The project was being designed by Klai Juba Architects. An advertisement for Sky Las Vegas was published on February 1, 2005, and read, \\"Dear Tara Reid. Come let it all hang out.\\" The advertisement referred to a wardrobe malfunction that Reid had while posing for photographers at an event the previous year. In March 2005, Reid sued Sky Las Vegas, alleging that the project was benefiting from her malfunction and that the advertisement misrepresented her as \\"sexually lewd or immoral.\\" Reid wanted publication and distribution of the advertisement to cease. The case was settled later that year. In early April 2005, it was announced that groundbreaking was scheduled for early May, with completion scheduled for late 2006. The foundation was poured in September 2005. Construction had reached the 19th floor in January 2006, with an additional floor being added approximately every four days. Approximately 85 percent of the project's 409 units had been sold up to that time. NASCAR racer Geoff Bodine, who purchased a unit at Sky Las Vegas, attended a topping out party held for the project in September 2006. On April 3, 2007, a gas explosion occurred in a swimming-pool pump room on the fourth floor during construction. Three workers were sent to local hospitals, while a fourth worker had his injuries treated at the construction site. No damage was done to the building. M.J. Dean was the general contractor for the project, which cost $325 million. Hypo Real Estate co-financed the project by providing either $216.3 million or $260 million. Opening and operation Entrance Sky Las Vegas opened in May 2007, and was the first high-rise condominium project to open on the Las Vegas Strip. Four three-story residences known as SkySuites – each with four bedrooms and five bathrooms and measuring – occupy the upper three floors, above the penthouses. In July 2007, an unfinished penthouse sold for $2.7 million. Some units were rented out because of difficulty selling them, as a result of the poor economy. On July 4, 2012, a kitchen fire that was caused by an unattended stove in one of the units forced a brief evacuation of the 32nd and 33rd floors. Southbound lanes on the Las Vegas Strip were also temporarily closed by firefighters. The fire was extinguished after 10 minutes, and with no injuries. On April 25, 2013, a hot tub on the patio of a fifth-floor condominium caught on fire. South Las Vegas Boulevard was briefly closed off to traffic while firefighters contained the fire. A CVS Pharmacy store that operates inside the building was sold in March 2014, at a cost of $30 million, the most expensive sale price for a CVS store in the Las Vegas Valley. In April 2015, the tower's remaining unsold 65 units were put on the market as part of a bulk sale that also included of vacant retail space on the second and third floors. The sale, with a listed price of \\"best offer,\\" did not include the CVS store. In September 2015, Pathfinder Partners purchased the tower's remaining 64 units. The CVS was listed for sale in January 2016.

Initially, plans were announced in 1998 for Great Masters, a $300 million condominium project consisting of 56-story twin towers. The land was sold in 2000 to Turnberry Associates, which announced plans to build Madison Towers on the property. The $250 million condominium project would include 25-story twin towers, but the start of construction was delayed due to poor economic conditions as a result of the September 11 attacks. Conditions improved and the project was redesigned to be larger, with the new name of Turnberry Towers. Construction of the first tower began in June 2005, and was finished in 2007, followed by the completion of the second tower a year later. History Initial plans In November 1998, high- rise developer Bruce Stark and his Hawaii-based company, Stark Properties, announced plans to build Great Masters, a 56-story twin-tower condominium project with 592 units. The project would cost $300 million, with an estimated sales value of $500 million. The project would be built on situated at Paradise Road and Karen Avenue, behind the Sahara hotel-casino that was located on the Las Vegas Strip. Construction was expected to begin in August 1999. Stark was not concerned about competition from Park Towers or the nearby Turnberry Place. Great Masters and Turnberry Place were among the largest condominium projects proposed for the Las Vegas Valley at that time, and Great Masters would be the tallest entirely residential building in the United States, standing at . In early 2000, Stark Properties sold the land for $13.5 million to Turnberry Associates. In June 2000, Turnberry announced plans for Madison Towers, a $250 million gated condominium complex consisting of two 25-story towers that would be built on the land. Madison Towers would offer smaller condominium units at a lower price compared to the company's Turnberry Place property. The project was still in the final design stages at the time of announcement, with construction expected to begin in spring 2001. The first tower was expected to open in summer 2002. In early 2002, the project was put on hold for 12 to 18 months following decreased sales, the result of poor economic conditions caused by the September 11 attacks. As of June 2002, the project was being redesigned for a reduction in size, from 600 units to 450, with the potential to begin construction at the end of the year. Improvements in the economy led Turnberry to increase the size of the project prior to construction. By July 2004, Madison Towers consisted of two 40-story towers, with plans to open a sales center on the site later that year. In addition to the size increase, the project was renamed Turnberry Towers later that year. The project was designed by Robert M. Swedroe Architects. In March 2005, Turnberry stated that the project would consist of two 45-story towers with a total of 636 units. Sales were expected to begin that month, with construction scheduled to begin within 30 days. The first tower was scheduled for completion in early 2007. In April 2005, a lawsuit was filed by a buyer who purchased a unit in the original Madison Towers project four years earlier. The buyer alleged that Turnberry would not honor his contract for a unit that would now cost more money as a result of the design change. Construction Construction of the first tower began in June 2005, with nearly all of its 316 units sold up to that time; the second tower was approximately half sold. Condominium prices started around $500,000, with an average cost of $750,000. The project was expected to cost $500 million. The first tower was scheduled for completion in June 2007, while construction of the second tower was to begin in summer 2006. Turnberry Place Construction was the general contractor. In October 2005, seven construction workers were injured when sections of the second floor collapsed. In March 2006, excavation was underway to prepare for the construction of the second tower. During 2006, the project received a construction loan for $360 million that was funded by several banks, including Prudential Insurance Company of America. The East Tower was topped off in October 2006. As of February 2007, the second tower had been built up to the 34th floor, with 125 units left for sale. Many buyers were second-home owners and were from southern California. Approximately 800 construction workers were on the site every day. The first tower was scheduled to receive its certificate of occupancy in early June 2007. Both towers were to include their own pools and fitness centers. The East Tower neared completion in May 2007, and was finished by the following month, with the first residents expected to move in during July 2007. The West Tower was topped off in June 2007, and was completed in 2008. Both of the 45-story towers contain 318 units each. The towers stand . Operation By 2009, the property had begun renting out units that remained unsold as a result of the Great Recession. Early that year, Prudential took over the project by paying $164 million to prevent it from defaulting on the $360 million construction loan. That year, Prudential sued Turnberry for failure to pay $10 million on the construction loan. Prudential also alleged that Turnberry wrongfully diverted $12 million in condominium revenues to pay for expenses not in the initial budget, rather than using the funds to pay off the loan. Prudential also stated that it had to cover the costs of liens, taxes, and other expenses that were to be handled by Turnberry. Additionally, Prudential accused Turnberry of failure to provide purchase deposit refunds for customers totaling $4.2 million. In 2011, real estate investor CIM Group purchased the remaining 279 unsold units at a price of $48.3 million. The East Tower contained 39 unsold units, while the second tower contained 240.

The key examples are the matrix coefficients of the spherical principal series, the irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of the unitary representation of G on L2(G/K). In this case the commutant of G is generated by the algebra of biinvariant functions on G with respect to K acting by right convolution. It is commutative if in addition G/K is a symmetric space, for example when G is a connected semisimple Lie group with finite centre and K is a maximal compact subgroup. The matrix coefficients of the spherical principal series describe precisely the spectrum of the corresponding C* algebra generated by the biinvariant functions of compact support, often called a Hecke algebra. The spectrum of the commutative Banach *-algebra of biinvariant L1 functions is larger; when G is a semisimple Lie group with maximal compact subgroup K, additional characters come from matrix coefficients of the complementary series, obtained by analytic continuation of the spherical principal series. Zonal spherical functions have been explicitly determined for real semisimple groups by Harish-Chandra. For special linear groups, they were independently discovered by Israel Gelfand and Mark Naimark. For complex groups, the theory simplifies significantly, because G is the complexification of K, and the formulas are related to analytic continuations of the Weyl character formula on K. The abstract functional analytic theory of zonal spherical functions was first developed by Roger Godement. Apart from their group theoretic interpretation, the zonal spherical functions for a semisimple Lie group G also provide a set of simultaneous eigenfunctions for the natural action of the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of G on L2(G/K), as differential operators on the symmetric space G/K. For semisimple p-adic Lie groups, the theory of zonal spherical functions and Hecke algebras was first developed by Satake and Ian G. Macdonald. The analogues of the Plancherel theorem and Fourier inversion formula in this setting generalise the eigenfunction expansions of Mehler, Weyl and Fock for singular ordinary differential equations: they were obtained in full generality in the 1960s in terms of Harish-Chandra's c-function. The name \\"zonal spherical function\\" comes from the case when G is SO(3,R) acting on a 2-sphere and K is the subgroup fixing a point: in this case the zonal spherical functions can be regarded as certain functions on the sphere invariant under rotation about a fixed axis. Definitions Let G be a locally compact unimodular topological group and K a compact subgroup and let H1 = L2(G/K). Thus H1 admits a unitary representation π of G by left translation. This is a subrepresentation of the regular representation, since if H= L2(G) with left and right regular representations λ and ρ of G and P is the orthogonal projection : P =\\\\int_K \\\\rho(k) \\\\, dk from H to H1 then H1 can naturally be identified with PH with the action of G given by the restriction of λ. On the other hand, by von Neumann's commutation theorem, Algèbres hilbertiennes. : \\\\lambda(G)^\\\\prime= \\\\rho(G)^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}, where S' denotes the commutant of a set of operators S, so that : \\\\pi(G)^\\\\prime = P \\\\rho(G)^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}P. Thus the commutant of π is generated as a von Neumann algebra by operators : P\\\\rho(f)P = \\\\int_G f(g) (P \\\\rho(g)P) \\\\, dg where f is a continuous function of compact support on G. However Pρ(f) P is just the restriction of ρ(F) to H1, where : F(g) =\\\\int_K \\\\int_K f(kgk^\\\\prime) \\\\, dk\\\\, dk^\\\\prime is the K-biinvariant continuous function of compact support obtained by averaging f by K on both sides. Thus the commutant of π is generated by the restriction of the operators ρ(F) with F in Cc(K\\\\G/K), the K-biinvariant continuous functions of compact support on G. These functions form a * algebra under convolution with involution : F^*(g) =\\\\overline{F(g^{-1})}, often called the Hecke algebra for the pair (G, K). Let A(K\\\\G/K) denote the C* algebra generated by the operators ρ(F) on H1. The pair (G, K) is said to be a Gelfand pair if one, and hence all, of the following algebras are commutative: * \\\\pi(G)^\\\\prime * C_c(K\\\\backslash G /K) * A(K\\\\backslash G /K). Since A(K\\\\G/K) is a commutative C* algebra, by the Gelfand–Naimark theorem it has the form C0(X), where X is the locally compact space of norm continuous * homomorphisms of A(K\\\\G/K) into C. A concrete realization of the * homomorphisms in X as K-biinvariant uniformly bounded functions on G is obtained as follows. Because of the estimate : \\\\\\\\pi(F)\\\\\\\\le \\\\int_G F(g) \\\\, dg \\\\equiv \\\\F\\\\_1, the representation π of Cc(K\\\\G/K) in A(K\\\\G/K) extends by continuity to L1(K\\\\G/K), the * algebra of K-biinvariant integrable functions. The image forms a dense * subalgebra of A(K\\\\G/K). The restriction of a * homomorphism χ continuous for the operator norm is also continuous for the norm ·1. Since the Banach space dual of L1 is L∞, it follows that : \\\\chi(\\\\pi(F)) =\\\\int_G F(g) h(g) \\\\, dg, for some unique uniformly bounded K-biinvariant function h on G. These functions h are exactly the zonal spherical functions for the pair (G, K). Properties A zonal spherical function h has the following properties: # h is uniformly continuous on G # h(x) h(y) = \\\\int_K h(xky) \\\\,dk \\\\,\\\\,(x,y\\\\in G). # h(1) =1 (normalisation) # h is a positive definite function on G # f * h is proportional to h for all f in Cc(K\\\\G/K). These are easy consequences of the fact that the bounded linear functional χ defined by h is a homomorphism. Properties 2, 3 and 4 or properties 3, 4 and 5 characterize zonal spherical functions. A more general class of zonal spherical functions can be obtained by dropping positive definiteness from the conditions, but for these functions there is no longer any connection with unitary representations. For semisimple Lie groups, there is a further characterization as eigenfunctions of invariant differential operators on G/K (see below). In fact, as a special case of the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction, there is one-one correspondence between irreducible representations σ of G having a unit vector v fixed by K and zonal spherical functions h given by : h(g) = (\\\\sigma(g) v,v). Such irreducible representations are often described as having class one. They are precisely the irreducible representations required to decompose the induced representation π on H1. Each representation σ extends uniquely by continuity to A(K\\\\G/K), so that each zonal spherical function satisfies : \\\\left\\\\int_G f(g) h(g)\\\\, dg\\\\right \\\\le \\\\\\\\pi(f)\\\\ for f in A(K\\\\G/K). Moreover, since the commutant π(G)' is commutative, there is a unique probability measure μ on the space of * homomorphisms X such that : \\\\int_G f(g)^2 \\\\, dg = \\\\int_X \\\\chi(\\\\pi(f))^2 \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\chi). μ is called the Plancherel measure. Since π(G)' is the centre of the von Neumann algebra generated by G, it also gives the measure associated with the direct integral decomposition of H1 in terms of the irreducible representations σχ. Gelfand pairs If G is a connected Lie group, then, thanks to the work of Cartan, Malcev, Iwasawa and Chevalley, G has a maximal compact subgroup, unique up to conjugation. In this case K is connected and the quotient G/K is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space. When G is in addition semisimple, this can be seen directly using the Cartan decomposition associated to the symmetric space G/K, a generalisation of the polar decomposition of invertible matrices. Indeed, if τ is the associated period two automorphism of G with fixed point subgroup K, then :G=P\\\\cdot K, where : P= \\\\\\\\{g\\\\in G \\\\tau(g)=g^{-1}\\\\\\\\}. Under the exponential map, P is diffeomorphic to the -1 eigenspace of τ in the Lie algebra of G. Since τ preserves K, it induces an automorphism of the Hecke algebra Cc(K\\\\G/K). On the other hand, if F lies in Cc(K\\\\G/K), then :F(τg) = F(g−1), so that τ induces an anti-automorphism, because inversion does. Hence, when G is semisimple, * the Hecke algebra is commutative * (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. More generally the same argument gives the following criterion of Gelfand for (G,K) to be a Gelfand pair: * G is a unimodular locally compact group; * K is a compact subgroup arising as the fixed points of a period two automorphism τ of G; * G =K·P (not necessarily a direct product), where P is defined as above. The two most important examples covered by this are when: * G is a compact connected semisimple Lie group with τ a period two automorphism; * G is a semidirect product A\\\\rtimes K, with A a locally compact Abelian group without 2-torsion and τ(a· k)= k·a−1 for a in A and k in K. The three cases cover the three types of symmetric spaces G/K: # Non-compact type, when K is a maximal compact subgroup of a non-compact real semisimple Lie group G; # Compact type, when K is the fixed point subgroup of a period two automorphism of a compact semisimple Lie group G; # Euclidean type, when A is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space with an orthogonal action of K. Cartan–Helgason theorem Let G be a compact semisimple connected and simply connected Lie group and τ a period two automorphism of a G with fixed point subgroup K = Gτ. In this case K is a connected compact Lie group. In addition let T be a maximal torus of G invariant under τ, such that T \\\\cap P is a maximal torus in P, and set :S= K\\\\cap T = T^\\\\tau. S is the direct product of a torus and an elementary abelian 2-group. In 1929 Élie Cartan found a rule to determine the decomposition of L2(G/K) into the direct sum of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of G, which was proved rigorously only in 1970 by Sigurdur Helgason. Because the commutant of G on L2(G/K) is commutative, each irreducible representation appears with multiplicity one. By Frobenius reciprocity for compact groups, the irreducible representations V that occur are precisely those admitting a non-zero vector fixed by K. From the representation theory of compact semisimple groups, irreducible representations of G are classified by their highest weight. This is specified by a homomorphism of the maximal torus T into T. The Cartan–Helgason theorem states that :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" the irreducible representations of G admitting a non-zero vector fixed by K are precisely those with highest weights corresponding to homomorphisms trivial on S. } The corresponding irreducible representations are called spherical representations. The theorem can be proved using the Iwasawa decomposition: : \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{k} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{n}, where \\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\mathfrak{k}, \\\\mathfrak{a} are the complexifications of the Lie algebras of G, K, A = T \\\\cap P and :\\\\mathfrak{n}=\\\\bigoplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\alpha, summed over all eigenspaces for T in \\\\mathfrak{g} corresponding to positive roots α not fixed by τ. Let V be a spherical representation with highest weight vector v0 and K-fixed vector vK. Since v0 is an eigenvector of the solvable Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{p}, the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem implies that the K-module generated by v0 is the whole of V. If Q is the orthogonal projection onto the fixed points of K in V obtained by averaging over G with respect to Haar measure, it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{ v_K = c Qv_0} for some non-zero constant c. Because vK is fixed by S and v0 is an eigenvector for S, the subgroup S must actually fix v0, an equivalent form of the triviality condition on S. Conversely if v0 is fixed by S, then it can be shown that the matrix coefficient : \\\\displaystyle{f(g) =(gv_0,v_0)} is non- negative on K. Since f(1) > 0, it follows that (Qv0, v0) > 0 and hence that Qv0 is a non-zero vector fixed by K. Harish-Chandra's formula If G is a non-compact semisimple Lie group, its maximal compact subgroup K acts by conjugation on the component P in the Cartan decomposition. If A is a maximal Abelian subgroup of G contained in P, then A is diffeomorphic to its Lie algebra under the exponential map and, as a further generalisation of the polar decomposition of matrices, every element of P is conjugate under K to an element of A, so that, Chapter IX. :G =KAK. There is also an associated Iwasawa decomposition :G =KAN, where N is a closed nilpotent subgroup, diffeomorphic to its Lie algebra under the exponential map and normalised by A. Thus S=AN is a closed solvable subgroup of G, the semidirect product of N by A, and G = KS. If α in Hom(A,T) is a character of A, then α extends to a character of S, by defining it to be trivial on N. There is a corresponding unitary induced representation σ of G on L2(G/S) = L2(K), a so-called (spherical) principal series representation. This representation can be described explicitly as follows. Unlike G and K, the solvable Lie group S is not unimodular. Let dx denote left invariant Haar measure on S and ΔS the modular function of S. Then : \\\\int_G f(g) \\\\,dg = \\\\int_S\\\\int_K f(x\\\\cdot k) \\\\, dx\\\\, dk = \\\\int_S\\\\int_K f(k\\\\cdot x) \\\\Delta_S(x)\\\\,dx\\\\, dk. The principal series representation σ is realised on L2(K) as : (\\\\sigma(g) \\\\xi)(k) = \\\\alpha^\\\\prime(g^{-1}k)^{-1} \\\\, \\\\xi(U(g^{-1}k)), where :g = U(g)\\\\cdot X(g) is the Iwasawa decomposition of g with U(g) in K and X(g) in S and :\\\\alpha^\\\\prime(kx) = \\\\Delta_S(x)^{1/2} \\\\alpha(x) for k in K and x in S. The representation σ is irreducible, so that if v denotes the constant function 1 on K, fixed by K, : \\\\varphi_\\\\alpha(g)=(\\\\sigma(g)v,v) defines a zonal spherical function of G. Computing the inner product above leads to Harish-Chandra's formula for the zonal spherical function :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" \\\\varphi_\\\\alpha(g) = \\\\int_K \\\\alpha^\\\\prime(gk)^{-1}\\\\, dk } as an integral over K. Harish-Chandra proved that these zonal spherical functions exhaust the characters of the C* algebra generated by the Cc(K \\\\ G / K) acting by right convolution on L2(G / K). He also showed that two different characters α and β give the same zonal spherical function if and only if α = β·s, where s is in the Weyl group of A : W(A)=N_K(A)/C_K(A), the quotient of the normaliser of A in K by its centraliser, a finite reflection group. It can also be verified directly that this formula defines a zonal spherical function, without using representation theory. The proof for general semisimple Lie groups that every zonal spherical formula arises in this way requires the detailed study of G-invariant differential operators on G/K and their simultaneous eigenfunctions (see below). In the case of complex semisimple groups, Harish-Chandra and Felix Berezin realised independently that the formula simplified considerably and could be proved more directly. The remaining positive-definite zonal spherical functions are given by Harish- Chandra's formula with α in Hom(A,C*) instead of Hom(A,T). Only certain α are permitted and the corresponding irreducible representations arise as analytic continuations of the spherical principal series. This so-called \\"complementary series\\" was first studied by for G = SL(2,R) and by and for G = SL(2,C). Subsequently in the 1960s, the construction of a complementary series by analytic continuation of the spherical principal series was systematically developed for general semisimple Lie groups by Ray Kunze, Elias Stein and Bertram Kostant. Since these irreducible representations are not tempered, they are not usually required for harmonic analysis on G (or G / K). Eigenfunctions Harish-Chandra proved that zonal spherical functions can be characterised as those normalised positive definite K-invariant functions on G/K that are eigenfunctions of D(G/K), the algebra of invariant differential operators on G. This algebra acts on G/K and commutes with the natural action of G by left translation. It can be identified with the subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of G fixed under the adjoint action of K. As for the commutant of G on L2(G/K) and the corresponding Hecke algebra, this algebra of operators is commutative; indeed it is a subalgebra of the algebra of mesurable operators affiliated with the commutant π(G)', an Abelian von Neumann algebra. As Harish-Chandra proved, it is isomorphic to the algebra of W(A)-invariant polynomials on the Lie algebra of A, which itself is a polynomial ring by the Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem on polynomial invariants of finite reflection groups. The simplest invariant differential operator on G/K is the Laplacian operator; up to a sign this operator is just the image under π of the Casimir operator in the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of G. Thus a normalised positive definite K-biinvariant function f on G is a zonal spherical function if and only if for each D in D(G/K) there is a constant λD such that :\\\\displaystyle\\\\pi(D)f =\\\\lambda_D f, i.e. f is a simultaneous eigenfunction of the operators π(D). If ψ is a zonal spherical function, then, regarded as a function on G/K, it is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian there, an elliptic differential operator with real analytic coefficients. By analytic elliptic regularity, ψ is a real analytic function on G/K, and hence G. Harish-Chandra used these facts about the structure of the invariant operators to prove that his formula gave all zonal spherical functions for real semisimple Lie groups., pages 418–422, 427-434 Indeed, the commutativity of the commutant implies that the simultaneous eigenspaces of the algebra of invariant differential operators all have dimension one; and the polynomial structure of this algebra forces the simultaneous eigenvalues to be precisely those already associated with Harish-Chandra's formula. Example: SL(2,C) The group G = SL(2,C) is the complexification of the compact Lie group K = SU(2) and the double cover of the Lorentz group. The infinite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group were first studied by Dirac in 1945, who considered the discrete series representations, which he termed expansors. A systematic study was taken up shortly afterwards by Harish-Chandra, Gelfand–Naimark and Bargmann. The irreducible representations of class one, corresponding to the zonal spherical functions, can be determined easily using the radial component of the Laplacian operator. Indeed, any unimodular complex 2×2 matrix g admits a unique polar decomposition g = pv with v unitary and p positive. In turn p = uau*, with u unitary and a a diagonal matrix with positive entries. Thus g = uaw with w = u* v, so that any K-biinvariant function on G corresponds to a function of the diagonal matrix :a = \\\\begin{pmatrix} e^{r/2} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & e^{-r/2} \\\\end{pmatrix}, invariant under the Weyl group. Identifying G/K with hyperbolic 3-space, the zonal hyperbolic functions ψ correspond to radial functions that are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. But in terms of the radial coordinate r, the Laplacian is given by :L= -\\\\partial_r^2 - 2 \\\\coth r \\\\partial_r. Setting f(r) = sinh (r)·ψ(r), it follows that f is an odd function of r and an eigenfunction of \\\\partial_r^2. Hence :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" \\\\varphi(r) = {\\\\sin (\\\\ell r)\\\\over \\\\ell \\\\sinh r} } where \\\\ell is real. There is a similar elementary treatment for the generalized Lorentz groups SO(N,1) in and (recall that SO0(3,1) = SL(2,C) / ±I). Complex case If G is a complex semisimple Lie group, it is the complexification of its maximal compact subgroup K. If {\\\\mathfrak g} and \\\\mathfrak{k} are their Lie algebras, then : \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{k} \\\\oplus i\\\\mathfrak{k}. Let T be a maximal torus in K with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{t}. Then :A= \\\\exp i \\\\mathfrak{t}, \\\\,\\\\, P= \\\\exp i \\\\mathfrak{k}. Let : W= N_K(T)/T be the Weyl group of T in K. Recall characters in Hom(T,T) are called weights and can be identified with elements of the weight lattice Λ in Hom(\\\\mathfrak{t}, R) = \\\\mathfrak{t}^*. There is a natural ordering on weights and every finite-dimensional irreducible representation (π, V) of K has a unique highest weight λ. The weights of the adjoint representation of K on \\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\ominus \\\\mathfrak{t} are called roots and ρ is used to denote half the sum of the positive roots α, Weyl's character formula asserts that for z = exp X in T : \\\\displaystyle\\\\chi_\\\\lambda(e^X)\\\\equiv {\\\\rm Tr} \\\\, \\\\pi(z) = A_{\\\\lambda+\\\\rho}(e^X)/A_{\\\\rho}(e^X), where, for μ in \\\\mathfrak{t}^*, Aμ denotes the antisymmetrisation :\\\\displaystyle A_\\\\mu(e^X) =\\\\sum_{s\\\\in W} \\\\varepsilon(s) e^{i\\\\mu(sX)}, and ε denotes the sign character of the finite reflection group W. Weyl's denominator formula expresses the denominator Aρ as a product: :\\\\displaystyle A_\\\\rho(e^X) = e^{i\\\\rho(X)} \\\\prod_{\\\\alpha>0}(1 - e^{-i\\\\alpha(X)}), where the product is over the positive roots. Weyl's dimension formula asserts that :\\\\displaystyle\\\\chi_\\\\lambda(1) \\\\equiv {\\\\rm dim}\\\\, V = {\\\\prod_{\\\\alpha>0} (\\\\lambda + \\\\rho,\\\\alpha)\\\\over \\\\prod_{\\\\alpha>0} (\\\\rho,\\\\alpha)}. where the inner product on \\\\mathfrak{t}^* is that associated with the Killing form on \\\\mathfrak{k}. Now * every irreducible representation of K extends holomorphically to the complexification G * every irreducible character χλ(k) of K extends holomorphically to the complexification of K and \\\\mathfrak{t}^*. * for every λ in Hom(A,T) = i\\\\mathfrak{t}^*, there is a zonal spherical function φλ. The Berezin–Harish–Chandra formula asserts that for X in i\\\\mathfrak{t} :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  \\\\varphi_\\\\lambda(e^X) = {\\\\chi_\\\\lambda(e^X)\\\\over\\\\chi_\\\\lambda(1)}. } In other words: * the zonal spherical functions on a complex semisimple Lie group are given by analytic continuation of the formula for the normalised characters. One of the simplest proofs of this formula involves the radial component on A of the Laplacian on G, a proof formally parallel to Helgason's reworking of Freudenthal's classical proof of the Weyl character formula, using the radial component on T of the Laplacian on K. In the latter case the class functions on K can be identified with W-invariant functions on T. The radial component of ΔK on T is just the expression for the restriction of ΔK to W-invariant functions on T, where it is given by the formula :\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta_K= h^{-1}\\\\circ \\\\Delta_T \\\\circ h + \\\\\\\\rho\\\\^2, where :\\\\displaystyle h(e^X) = A_\\\\rho(e^X) for X in \\\\mathfrak{t}. If χ is a character with highest weight λ, it follows that φ = h·χ satisfies : \\\\Delta_T \\\\varphi= (\\\\\\\\lambda + \\\\rho\\\\^2 -\\\\\\\\rho\\\\^2) \\\\varphi. Thus for every weight μ with non-zero Fourier coefficient in φ, :\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\lambda +\\\\rho\\\\^2 = \\\\\\\\mu+\\\\rho\\\\^2. The classical argument of Freudenthal shows that μ + ρ must have the form s(λ + ρ) for some s in W, so the character formula follows from the antisymmetry of φ. Similarly K-biinvariant functions on G can be identified with W(A)-invariant functions on A. The radial component of ΔG on A is just the expression for the restriction of ΔG to W(A)-invariant functions on A. It is given by the formula :\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta_G= H^{-1}\\\\circ \\\\Delta_A\\\\circ H - \\\\\\\\rho\\\\^2, where :\\\\displaystyle H(e^X) = A_\\\\rho(e^X) for X in i\\\\mathfrak{t}. The Berezin–Harish–Chandra formula for a zonal spherical function φ can be established by introducing the antisymmetric function :\\\\displaystyle f= H\\\\cdot\\\\varphi, which is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian ΔA. Since K is generated by copies of subgroups that are homomorphic images of SU(2) corresponding to simple roots, its complexification G is generated by the corresponding homomorphic images of SL(2,C). The formula for zonal spherical functions of SL(2,C) implies that f is a periodic function on i\\\\mathfrak{t} with respect to some sublattice. Antisymmetry under the Weyl group and the argument of Freudenthal again imply that ψ must have the stated form up to a multiplicative constant, which can be determined using the Weyl dimension formula. Example: SL(2,R) The theory of zonal spherical functions for SL(2,R) originated in the work of Mehler in 1881 on hyperbolic geometry. He discovered the analogue of the Plancherel theorem, which was rediscovered by Fock in 1943. The corresponding eigenfunction expansion is termed the Mehler–Fock transform. It was already put on a firm footing in 1910 by Hermann Weyl's important work on the spectral theory of ordinary differential equations. The radial part of the Laplacian in this case leads to a hypergeometric differential equation, the theory of which was treated in detail by Weyl. Weyl's approach was subsequently generalised by Harish-Chandra to study zonal spherical functions and the corresponding Plancherel theorem for more general semisimple Lie groups. Following the work of Dirac on the discrete series representations of SL(2,R), the general theory of unitary irreducible representations of SL(2,R) was developed independently by Bargmann, Harish-Chandra and Gelfand–Naimark. The irreducible representations of class one, or equivalently the theory of zonal spherical functions, form an important special case of this theory. The group G = SL(2,R) is a double cover of the 3-dimensional Lorentz group SO(2,1), the symmetry group of the hyperbolic plane with its Poincaré metric. It acts by Möbius transformations. The upper half-plane can be identified with the unit disc by the Cayley transform. Under this identification G becomes identified with the group SU(1,1), also acting by Möbius transformations. Because the action is transitive, both spaces can be identified with G/K, where K = SO(2). The metric is invariant under G and the associated Laplacian is G-invariant, coinciding with the image of the Casimir operator. In the upper half-plane model the Laplacian is given by the formula :\\\\displaystyle\\\\Delta=-4y^{2}(\\\\partial_x^2 +\\\\partial_y^2). If s is a complex number and z = x + i y with y > 0, the function :\\\\displaystyle f_s(z) =y^{s}= \\\\exp({s}\\\\cdot\\\\log y), is an eigenfunction of Δ: :\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta f_s = 4s(1-s) f_s. Since Δ commutes with G, any left translate of fs is also an eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue. In particular, averaging over K, the function :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  \\\\varphi_s(z) =\\\\int_K f_s(k\\\\cdot z)\\\\, dk } is a K-invariant eigenfunction of Δ on G/K. When :\\\\displaystyle s={1\\\\over 2} + i\\\\tau, with τ real, these functions give all the zonal spherical functions on G. As with Harish-Chandra's more general formula for semisimple Lie groups, φs is a zonal spherical function because it is the matrix coefficient corresponding to a vector fixed by K in the principal series. Various arguments are available to prove that there are no others. One of the simplest classical Lie algebraic arguments is to note that, since Δ is an elliptic operator with analytic coefficients, by analytic elliptic regularity any eigenfunction is necessarily real analytic. Hence, if the zonal spherical function corresponds to the matrix coefficient for a vector v and representation σ, the vector v is an analytic vector for G and :\\\\displaystyle(\\\\sigma(e^{X})v,v)= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty (\\\\sigma(X)^n v,v)/n! for X in i\\\\mathfrak{t}. The infinitesimal form of the irreducible unitary representations with a vector fixed by K were worked out classically by Bargmann. They correspond precisely to the principal series of SL(2,R). It follows that the zonal spherical function corresponds to a principal series representation. Another classical argument proceeds by showing that on radial functions the Laplacian has the form :\\\\displaystyle\\\\Delta=-\\\\partial_r^2 - \\\\coth(r)\\\\cdot \\\\partial_r, so that, as a function of r, the zonal spherical function φ(r) must satisfy the ordinary differential equation :\\\\displaystyle\\\\varphi^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} + \\\\coth r\\\\, \\\\varphi^\\\\prime = \\\\alpha \\\\, \\\\varphi for some constant α. The change of variables t = sinh r transforms this equation into the hypergeometric differential equation. The general solution in terms of Legendre functions of complex index is given by :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" \\\\varphi(r)=P_\\\\rho(\\\\cosh r) = {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} (\\\\cosh r + \\\\sinh r \\\\, \\\\cos \\\\theta)^\\\\rho \\\\, d\\\\theta, } where α = ρ(ρ+1). Further restrictions on ρ are imposed by boundedness and positive-definiteness of the zonal spherical function on G. There is yet another approach, due to Mogens Flensted-Jensen, which derives the properties of the zonal spherical functions on SL(2,R), including the Plancherel formula, from the corresponding results for SL(2,C), which are simple consequences of the Plancherel formula and Fourier inversion formula for R. This \\"method of descent\\" works more generally, allowing results for a real semisimple Lie group to be derived by descent from the corresponding results for its complexification. Further directions * The theory of zonal functions that are not necessarily positive-definite. These are given by the same formulas as above, but without restrictions on the complex parameter s or ρ. They correspond to non-unitary representations. * Harish-Chandra's eigenfunction expansion and inversion formula for spherical functions. This is an important special case of his Plancherel theorem for real semisimple Lie groups. * The structure of the Hecke algebra. Harish-Chandra and Godement proved that, as convolution algebras, there are natural isomorphisms between Cc∞(K \\\\ G / K ) and Cc∞(A)W, the subalgebra invariant under the Weyl group. This is straightforward to establish for SL(2,R). * Spherical functions for Euclidean motion groups and compact Lie groups. * Spherical functions for p-adic Lie groups.

It was based on the novel of the same name by Bruce Manning. In a small town, an overheard conversation on a telephone party line results in gossip that causes a great deal of trouble for a young woman and a wealthy man. __FORCETOC__ Plot Matthew Putnam (Victor Jory) is summoned back to his small hometown of Rockridge by his aged, bedridden aunt Nettie (Helen Lowell) after seven years of enjoying himself in Europe, where he had been sent to study. She is tired and wants him to take charge of Putnam Dairies, the family business and the town's major employer. Every mother with a marriageable daughter is excited by the return of the wealthy young man, including Mathilda Sherman (Clara Blandick). However, Matthew shows no interest in Mathilda's daughter Irene (Geneva Mitchell). When Matthew visits his good friend Will Oliver (Charley Grapewin), he is pleasantly surprised to see how grown up and beautiful Will's daughter Marge (Jean Arthur) has become. His reluctance to remain in town evaporates as he spends more and more time with herflirting with her at the bank where she works. This does not sit well with Roy Daniels (Robert Allen). When Roy makes his bid for her affections, she turns him down, so he decides to leave for New York City the next day. Marge is up late at night trying to balance the church's finances, for which she and Roy are responsible. Finally, an irate Will calls over the shared telephone line (a \\"party line\\") and leaves an angry message for Roy to come over to straighten out the mess before he leaves town. However, telephone eavesdroppers misinterpret the message and assume that Roy has gotten Marge pregnant and is trying to leave town without marrying her. Mathilda is delighted at the ostensible scandal and bullies her husband Tom (Oscar Apfel), the president of the Sherman Bank, into firing Marge. She also disqualifies Marge's winning entry in the prestigious annual flower show. Marge and Matthew are oblivious to the rumors. He asks her to marry him; she accepts, provided they elope the next day. When Matthew is late for their elopement, Marge assumes he believes the stories. Will, having discovered it was his call that started the whole mess, shoots himself, but botches his suicide and survives with only a minor head wound. Marge and Mathew separately find out about the ugly stories being circulated about Marge. Matthew decides to teach the town a sharp lesson. He first transfers all his money out of the Sherman Bank, which would lead to its collapse, and orders the replacement of all 300 local workers with out-of- towners. Faced with the destruction of their community, the workers organize a meeting that Matthew attends in the new town hall. Before things get totally out of hand, Matthew's aunt Nettiewho hadn't left bed the last fifteen yearsshows up and gives the townsfolk a tongue-lashing for their malicious gossip by bringing up their own past misdeeds. Everything is eventually straightened out and the couple sneak off to the nearby town Springfield to get married. However, the chastened townspeople have not changed their ways. A mock disagreement between the newlyweds about where they should spend their honeymoon is seen and misreported as a full-blown argument by Bert West.

While under construction, the ships were altered to accommodate a single AA gun on a platform abaft the rear funnel and a pair of single two-pounder () AA guns on single mounts. They were also fitted with two triple mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes between the 3-inch AA gun and the rear pair of 4.7-inch guns.

Part of the Armée de l'Est was billeted on his grandfather's property in 1871 and watching their activities inspired his later interest in historical scenes. After completing his primary education, he attended the local Industrieschule, where he studied engraving with Johann Conrad Werdmüller. In 1880, he began a photography apprenticeship with his uncle Oswald Welti (1843-1932) in Lausanne, but stayed with him for only one year. In 1882, he was able to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and came under the influence of Arnold Böcklin, who he met in 1885. After graduating, he obtained financial support from Franz Rose (1854-1912), a generous patron of the arts. He met and married Emmeline Wildbolz in 1894 and they settled in Höngg, a suburb of Zürich. After his father's death, he assuaged his grief by visiting Innertkirchen and Vättis, where he created numerous pastel nature studies. After that, he worked in Munich until 1908. while there, he became friends with the author, Hermann Hesse. His wife died, suddenly, in 1911. He died a year later, aged only fifty.

It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Rot-Weiß Oberhausen. The stadium currently has a capacity of 21,318 spectators (4,039 seats). History Stadion Niederrhein The stadium was officially opened on February 28, 1926, with a match between Duisburger SV and Arminia Bielefeld. At that time, it was called \\"Städtisches Stadion am Gräfenbusch\\", before being renamed to Stadion Niederrhein three years later, a name which has not been changed since. From the year 1970 on, the at the time brightest floodlights in a European stadium provided enough light to allow color television broadcasts for the first time. 1982, tartan tracks were added, and in the year 1996 the old scoreboard from the Ulrich Haberland Stadion in Leverkusen was installed, a gift from Bayer 04 Leverkusen to the city of Oberhausen. In the two following years, the standing and the main terrace were renovated. The construction works were finished in 1998 and the stadium was reopened in time for the new season of the 2. Bundesliga. With Rot-Weiß Oberhausen being promoted to 2. Bundesliga in 2008, again renovations were needed to meet the requirements from the DFL. As part of this, the turf was replaced completely and undersoil heating was installed. At the beginning of the year 2017, works to replace parts of the old standing area began. The new standing terraces were opened in 2018. Other uses The stadium was one of the four grounds of the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Three group stage matches, one semi-final and the match for third place took place in Oberhausen. At the INAS World Football Championships 2006 for athletes with intellectual disabilities two years later, the match between France and Hungary (1:3) was hosted in the Stadion Niederrhein. In the 2009/10 season of the UEFA Women's Champions League, the women's football club FCR 2001 Duisburg held two of their home matches in Oberhausen, because the floodlights in the PCC-Stadion in Duisburg did not satisfy the UEFA requirements.

It was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar dynasty. Its construction began in 1553, started by Maharana Udai Singh II of the Sisodia Rajput family as he shifted his capital from the erstwhile Chittor to the new found city of Udaipur.UDAIPUR: Since 1553 CE!-Its Founding & a Concise Photo Fact-File. Ranawat, P. S., 2014. . Kumbha Exclusives, India. The palace is located on the east bank of Lake Pichola and has several palaces built within its complex. The City Palace in Udaipur was built in a flamboyant style and is considered the largest of its type in the state of Rajasthan. It was built atop a hill, in a fusion of the Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles, providing a panoramic view of the city and its surroundings. Overlooking Lake Pichola, several historic monuments like the Lake Palace, Jag Mandir, Jagdish Temple, Monsoon Palace, and Neemach Mata temple, are all in the vicinity of the palace complex. Nestled within the Aravali mountain range, these landmarks are associated in popular culture with the filming of the 1983 James Bond movie Octopussy. History The City Palace was built concurrently with the establishment of the Udaipur city by Maharana Udai Singh II and his successor Maharanas over a period of the next 400 years. The Maharanas lived and administered their kingdom from this palace, thereby making the palace complex an important historic landmark. The Mewar kingdom was flourished initially in Nagda ( to the north of Udaipur), established in 568 AD by Guhil, the first Maharana of Mewar. In the 8th century, the capital was moved to Chittor, a hilltop fort from where the Sisodias and Choudharys ruled for 800 years. Maharana Uday Singh II inherited the Mewar kingdom at Chittor in 1537 but by that time there were signs of losing control of the fort in wars with the Mughals. Udai Singh II, therefore, chose the site near Lake Pichola for his new kingdom as the location was well protected on all sides by forests, lakes and the Aravalli hills. He had chosen this site for his new capital, much before the sacking of Chittor by Emperor Akbar, on the advice of a hermit he had met during one of his hunting expeditions. The earliest royal structure he built here was the Royal courtyard or 'Rai Angan',Henderson p. 95Ward p.195 which was the beginning of the building of the City Palace complex. The court was built at the location where the hermit had advised Maharana to build his new capital.Choy p.241 After Udai Singh's death in 1572, his son Maharana Pratap took the reins of power at Udaipur. However, he was defeated by the Mughal emperor Akbar at the Battle of Haldighati in 1576 and Udaipur fell under the Mughal rule.Abram p.228 After the death of Akbar, Mewar was given back to Maharana Pratap's son and successor Amar Singh I by Jahangir.However, the Mughal army sent many expeditions against the Mewar empire, culminating in a peace treaty between both rulers. But with the increasing Marathas attacks by 1761, Udaipur and the Mewar state were in dire straits and in ruins. By 1818, Maharana Bhim Singh signed a treaty with the British accepting their protection against the other empires. After the Indian independence in 1947, the Mewar Kingdom, along with other princely states of Rajasthan, merged with the democratic India, in 1949. The Mewar Kings subsequently also lost their special royal privileges and titles. The successive Maharanas, however, retained their ownership of the palaces in Udaipur and converted parts of the palace complex into heritage hotels. Architecture The facade of Udaipur City Palace Panoramic view the Udaipur City Palace Complex at night The series of palaces in the city palace complex, behind an exquisite facade of length and height, were built on a ridge on the east of lake Pichola. The complex is located in Udaipur city at , which is set with an average elevation of . They were built over a long period, from 1559 onwards, by 22 generations of Sisodia Rajputs. Several Maharanas starting with Udai Singh II, have contributed to this edifice, which comprises an agglomeration of structures, including 11 small separate palaces. The unique aspect of this conglomeration is that the architectural design is distinctly homogeneous. The palace complex has been built entirely in granite and marble. The interiors of the palace complex with its balconies, towers and cupolas exhibit delicate mirror-work, marble-work, murals, wall paintings, silver-work, inlay-work and leftover of colored glass. The complex provides a view of the lake and the Udaipur city from its upper terraces. The palaces within the complex are interlinked through a number of chowks or quadrangles with zigzag corridors, planned in this fashion to avoid surprise attacks by enemies. Erected in the complex, after entering through the main Tripolia (triple) gate, are the Suraj Gokhda (public address facade), the Mor-chowk (Peacock courtyard), the Dilkhush Mahal (heart's delight), the Surya Chopar, the Sheesh Mahal (Palace of glass and mirrors), the Moti Mahal (Palace of Pearls), the Krishna Vilas (named after Lord Krishna), Shambu Niwas (royal residence now), the Bhim Vilas, the Amar Vilas (with a raised garden) that faces the Badi Mahal (the big palace), the Fateprakash Palace and the Shiv Niwas Palace; the last two have been converted into heritage hotels. The complex is set with facilities of a post office, bank, travel agency, numerous craft shops and also an Indian boutique belonging to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The entire complex is the property of the Mewar royal family with various trusts maintaining the structures. Structures within the complex ;Gateways Gateways, colloquially called Pols, are set to the east of Udaipur city. A number of such gateways provide access to the palace complex. The main entry from the city is through the 'Badi Pol' (Great Gate), which leads to the first courtyard. Badi Pol (built in 1600) leads to the ‘Tripolia Pol', a triple-arched gate built in 1725, which provides the northern entry. The road between this gate and the palace is lined with shops and kiosks owned by craftsmen, book-binders, miniature painters and textile dealers. Between these two gates, eight marble arches or Toranas are erected. It is said that the Maharanas used to be weighed here with gold and silver, which was then distributed among the local people. Following the Tripolia gate is an arena in front of the Toran Pol and the facade palace, the Manak Chowk, where elephant fights were staged in the past to test their prowess before starting on war campaigns.Henderson p. 95-96 The main block of the city palace is approached through a modest door from the Ganesha Deodhi terrace. The door is flanked by whitewashed walls vibrantly painted with martial animals in the traditional Rajput style. There is a big boulders in the entry where elephants were tied. This elephant parking has now become car parking. Behind the entrance of Badi Pol there is a huge wall which was for the elephant fight. The elephant which touches the wall first would be considered weak elephant. Both elephants would pull each other in this fight. ;Amar Vilas Amar Vilas is the uppermost court inside the complex, which is an elevated garden. It provides entry to the Badi Mahal. It was built in Mughal style as a pleasure pavilion. It has cusped arcades enclosing a square marble tub. Amar Vilas is the highest point of the City Palace and has wonderful hanging gardens with fountains, towers, and terraces. ;Badi Mahal Badi Mahal Badi Mahal (Great Palace) also known as Garden Palace is the central palace situated on a high natural rock formation bis-a-bis the rest of the palace. The rooms on the ground floor appear to be at the level of the fourth floor in view of the height difference to its surrounding buildings. There is a swimming pool here, which was then used for Holi festival (festival of colors) celebration. In an adjoining hall, miniature paintings of 18th and 19th centuries are displayed. In addition, wall paintings of Jag Mandir (as it appeared in the 18th century), Vishnu of Jagdish temple, the very courtyard and an elephant fight scene are depicted. Elephants fights arranged in this venue ;Bhim Vilas Bhim Vilas has a gallery of a collection of miniature paintings that depict the real-life stories of Radha-Krishna. ;Chini Chitrashala Chini Chitrashala (Chinese art place) depicts Chinese and Dutch ornamental tiles. ;Choti Chitrashali Choti Chitrashali or 'Residence of Little Pictures', built in the early 19th century, has pictures of peacocks. ;Dilkhusha Mahal Dilkhusha Mahal or ‘Palace of Joy’ was built in 1620. ;Durbar hall Durbar Hall was built in 1909 within the Fatehpraksh Palace as a venue for official functions such as State banquets and meetings. The gallery of the hall was used by the Royal ladies to observe the Durbar proceedings. This hall has a luxuriant interior with large chandeliers. Weapons of the maharanas and some of their portraits are depicted here. The foundation stone for this hall was laid by Lord Minto, the Viceroy of India, in 1909, during the rule of Maharana Fateh Singh and was then called Minto Hall. ;Fateprakash Palace Fateprakash Palace, which is now a luxury hotel, has a crystal gallery that consists of crystal chairs, dressing tables, sofas, tables, chairs and beds, crockery, table fountains which were never used. There is also a jewel studded carpet here. Maharana Sajjan Singh had ordered these rare items in 1877 from F& C Osler & Co of London but he died before they arrived here. It is said that the packages containing these crystals remained unopened for 110 years. Royal Angan the first structure built by Maharana uday Singh ;Krishna Vilas Krishna Vilas is another chamber, which has a rich collection of miniature paintings that portray royal processions, festivals and games of the Maharanas. ;Laxmi Vilas chowk Laxmi Vilas Chowk is an art gallery with a distinctive collection of Mewar paintings. ;Manak Mahal The Manak Mahal approached from the Manak Chowk is an enclosure for formal audience for the Mewar rulers. It has a raised alcove inlaid completely in mirror glass. Sun-face emblems, in gleaming brass, religious insignia of the Sisodia dynasty are a recurring display at several locations in the City Palace with one being depicted on the façade of the Manak Chowk. The largest of such an emblem is also seen on the wall of the Surya Chopar, a reception centre at the lower level. Surya or Sun emblem of the Mewar dynasty depicts a Bhil, the Sun, Chittor Fort and a Rajput with an inscription in Sanskrit of a quotation from the Bhagavad Gita (Hindu holy scripture), which means \\"God Helps those who do their duty\\". It was customary for the Maharanas to offer obeisance to the Sun facing east, every morning before taking breakfast. ;Mor Chowk Mor Chowk or Peacock square is integral to the inner courts of the palace. The elaborate design of this chamber consists of three peacocks (representing the three seasons of summer, winter, and monsoon) modeled in high relief and faced with coloured glass mosaic, built into successive niches in the wall area or jharoka, These were built during Maharana Sajjan Singh's reign, 200 years after the palace was established. The peacocks have been crafted with 5000 pieces of glass, which shine in green, gold, and blue colours. The apartments in front of the Chowk are depicted with scenes of Hindu god Lord Krishna's legends. At the upper level, there is a projecting balcony, which is flanked by inserts of coloured glass. In an adjoining chamber, called the Kanch-ki-Burj, mosaics of mirrors adorn the walls. The Badi Charur Chowk within this chowk is a smaller court for private use. Its screen wall has painted and inlaid compositions depicting European men and Indian women. Proceeding further from the Mor-Chowk, in the Zenana Mahal or women's quarters exquisitely designed alcoves, balconies, colored windows, tiled walls, and floors are seen. ;Rang Bhawan Rang Bhawan is the palace that used to hold the royal treasure. There are temples of Lord Krishna, Meera Bai and Shiva located here. ;Sheesh Mahal Sheess Mahal or Palace of Mirrors and glasses was built in 1716 by Maharana Pratap for his wife Maharani Ajabde. ;Museum In 1974, a part of the city palace and the 'Zenana Mahal' (Ladies Chamber) were converted into a museum. The museum is open for public. In popular culture The palace was picturised as a hotel in the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy, where Bond (played by Roger Moore) stayed as he began his quest to apprehend the antagonist Kamal Khan (Louis Jordan). A 1991 documentary film directed for television by Werner Herzog called Jag Mandir consists of footage of an elaborate theatrical performance for the Maharana Arvind Singh Mewar at the City Palace staged by André Heller. The palace was used for filming part of Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (English: A Play of Bullets: Ram-Leela) 2013 directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. On 15 August 2018, India Post issued a commemorative stamp depicting the Palace. The palace area of Manak Chowk serves as the venue of the annual Maharana Mewar Foundation Awards, honouring students, national and international personalities.

It is also called the \\"Lake Garden Palace\\". The palace is located in Udaipur city in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Its construction is credited to three Maharanas of the Sisodia Rajputs of Mewar kingdom. The construction of the palace was started in 1551 by Maharana Amar Singh, continued by Maharana Karan Singh (1620–1628) and finally completed by Maharana Jagat Singh I (1628–1652). It is named as \\"Jagat Mandir\\" in honour of the last named Maharana Jagat Singh. The royal family used the palace as a summer resort and pleasure palace for holding parties. The palace served as a refuge to asylum seekers on two separate occasions. Geography Jag Mandir is situated in one of the two natural islands in the Pichola lake (named after the village Picholi nearby), on its southern end. The lake was initially created in the 15th century by a local banjara tribal chieftain for carrying grain across the streams. During the reign of Maharana Udai Singh II, in 1560, the lake was substantially enlarged by constructing dams across two streams. At that time, the Maharana also built the Jag Mandir and the Lake Palace (Jag Niwas Hotel) on separate islands in the midst of the lake. Udaipur city with its City Palace and other monuments and temples were built on the periphery of the lake. History Jag Mandir's history begins with the Maharana Karan Singh's benevolence shown to Emperor Shahjahan (1605–1627). Shahjahan, before he was crowned as Mughal Emperor, was known during his young days as Prince Khurram. As Khurram, he rebelled against his father Emperor Jahangir in 1623, because he wanted to be the heir to the Mughal throne. Faced with the danger of getting thwarted in his campaign, he sought refuge in the Mewar Kingdom at Udaipur, where he was given safe haven by the then Maharana Karan Singh (it is said that this courtesy was extended because Khurram's mother was a Rajput Hindu lady). He was initially kept in the City Palace along with his wife Mumtaz Mahal and his two sons, Prince Dara and Prince Aurangzeb. Later they were shifted to the Gul Mahal, as a safe refuge, in the midst of the lake (this place since then has also been called Khurram's Palace). Gul Mahal is a domed pavilion that was specially built for Khurram by Maharana Karan Singh. It was later enlarged by his son Jagat Singh into a huge palace and named as the Jag Mandir Palace. Khurram remained under Mewar's protection during 1623–1624. The palace had such an impact on Prince Khurram, who later became Emperor Shah Jahan, that it went on to become the inspiration for one of the most magnificent Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal. The irony of this act of hospitality shown by Karan Singh to Khurram is that his father Maharana Amar Singh had been defeated in the war in 1614 by Khurram. Later, prince Karan Singh had acted as an envoy to the Mughal court, and cordial amity developed between the two rival kingdoms of Mewar and the Mughals. This relationship helped Khurram who was in 1623 given refuge in Jag Mandir by Maharana Karana Singh. Following the death of Jahangir in 1627, Khurram ascended the throne of the Mughal Empire. It is said that Khurram was bestowed the title of Shah Jahan at the Badal Mahal in Udaipur before he left Udaipur for his crowning as the Mughal emperor. As an act of reward, Khurram not only restored six districts to the Mewar kingdom, which had been earlier annexed by the Mughals, but also presented a unique ruby jewel to Jagat Singh, son of Rana Karan Singh. After Karan Singh's death in 1628, Jagat Singh (1628–1652) became the Maharana. He was responsible for many additions to the Gul Mahal and called it the Jag Mandir, after himself. For building this remarkable structure, Maharana Jagat Singh was hailed as one of the best architects of the Mewar dynasty. Khurram, after becoming Emperor Shahjahan, particularly favoured the Maharana of Udaipur, which enabled the Mewar kingdom to regain its past glory. Jag Mandir Palace from above, on Lake Pichola, Udaipur. ca. 1873 Following the unusual friendship between the Mughals and the Mewar kingdom, peace prevailed, except for occasional threats posed by Aurangzeb. However, the real threat, which almost decimated Mewar kingdom for many years, came from the marauding Marathas. The hope of survival revived when in 1817, the British came to their rescue with the \\"Treaty of Paramountcy\\" promising restoration of all the hereditary territories and protecting the state from any future invasions. Thereafter, peace and prosperity ensued in Mewar Kingdom. The pride and glory of Sisodia Rajputs were fully restored. During the revolt in 1857, Maharana Swroop Singh (1842–1861) saved a number of European families, mostly women and children from Neemuch, which were given refuge in the Jag Mandir Palace. The revolt was popularly known as the Sepoy Mutiny, and was also called the Indian Mutiny, (or the first War of Independence) against the British Raj. After the Independence of India from the British rule, on 15 August 1947, at the initiative of Maharana Bhupal Singh, the Mewar kingdom merged with the Indian union in 1949 along with other princely states of Rajasthan. Structure Gul Mahal, the earliest structure before renovation Carved statues of elephants at the jetty entry, Jag Mandir Palace. The impressive series of structures in the three-storied Jag Mandir Palace include: *Gul Mahal, which was built first as refuge for prince Khurram; *the elegant facade flanked by four carved statues of elephants on either side at the jetty entry on the lake from Udaipur; *the Garden Courtyard and the Darikhana on its northern side; *Bara Patharon ka Mahal (palace of the 12 stones); *the Zenana Mahal – a southern extension to the Gul Mahal; *and the Kunwar Pada ka Mahal. Details of these structures and of the garden are elaborated below. ;Gul Mahal Gul Mahal was the first structure built in 1551, during the reign of Maharana Amar Singh, which was further developed during the reign of Maharana Jagat Singh to house the Mughal Prince Khurram. It was initially a small sandstone (yellow sandstone) palace with an imposing dome (which gives the appearance of a crown). The crescent of Islam is fixed on top of this dome. The Gul Mahal has three circular domed chambers, one above the other. Entry to these chambers is from a columned hall. Two marble chhatris with sloping cornices rise above the main façade. The massive marble slabs affixed to the interior walls were inlaid with coloured rubies, onyx, jasper, cornelian and jade. This type of decoration is reported to have been replicated by the Mughals in their Tomb of I'timād-ud- Daulah at Agra, in 1626. The palace is also said to have housed a throne carved from a single block of serpentine, which has not been traced. The Mahal is surrounded by a roomy circular apartment built in white and black marble with murals and paintings considered an uncommon feature in Rajput architecture. On the western wing of the palace, this type of design has been repeated in three other pavilions. ;Jag Mandir Jag Mandir is the main palace, which incorporates the Gul Mahal. The towers of the palace at the corners are octagonal in shape and are topped with cupolas. A labyrinth of reception halls, residential suites, and internal courts were built inside the palace, all in Rajput and Mughal architectural styles. The Zenana (residence of royal ladies chambers) adjoins the palace. The Kunwar Pada ka Mahal (the Palace of the Crown Prince) is located at the western end. ;Entry pavilion The pavilion at the entry to the palace is an impressive white colonnade of cusped arches. The landing jetty is also located for docking of boats arriving from the jetty of Bansi Ghat on the mainland near City Palace in Udaipur. The cruise is through the Pichola Lake. The pavilion is decorated with large elephants carved in stone, four on each side of the entry steps. They face the Lake Palace. The trunks of these elephants were damaged and replaced with polystyrene. The pavilion marks the perimeter of the island in the scenic backdrop of the Aravalli hills. ;Garden The flower garden in the palace complex is set up in the large Garden Courtyard. It has yew bushes, jasmine, frangipani trees, bougainvillea, palm trees, nasturtiums, verbena and moss rose. The courtyard itself is covered with black and white tiles. Fountains and water pools, crisscrossed by walkways with low marble handrails, bedeck the garden surroundings. The present Maharana hosts lavish parties here and also rents the place for private parties. ;Darikhana Darikhana is on the northern side of the palace, which is an open-sided terrace built with marble columns. This place is now run as a restaurant by the present Maharana. ;Bara Patharon ka Mahal Bara Patharon ka Mahal is located at the eastern wing of the main palace. Mahal is so named because twelve solid marble slabs have been used in its construction. Hence, it is also known as the \\"Palace of the Twelve Stones\\". Visitor information The Jag Mandir is approached only by boat from the Bansi Ghat jetty next to the Lake Palace in Udaipur. In popular culture The 1983 James Bond film, Octopussy featured the Jag Mandir as one of its main locations.

A structure may consist of multiple ore shoots with some veins or lodes being as thick as , and extending to thousands of feet horizontally and vertically.  Locations  There are complex stratigraphic historical parameters required in understanding how ore shoots are formed. Rocks go through numerous ductile and brittle deformation events before they become mineralized. The different locations of ore shoots in Australia are determined by investigating the internal architecture of the rock pile.

It is one of the several contiguous lakes, and developed over the last few centuries in and around the famous Udaipur city. The lakes around Udaipur were primarily created by building dams to meet the drinking water and irrigation needs of the city and its neighborhood. Two islands, Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir are located within Pichola Lake, and have been developed with several palaces to provide views of the lake. There are four islands on the lake: * Jag Niwas, where the Lake Palace is built. * Jag Mandir, with the palace of the same name. * Mohan Mandir, from where the king would watch the annual Gangaur festival celebration. * Arsi Vilas, small island which was an ammunition depot, but also a small palace. This one was built by one of the maharanas of Udaipur to enjoy the sunset on the lake. It is also a sanctuary catering to a variety of birds, including tufted ducks, coots, egrets, terns, cormorants and kingfishers. Three of the numerous lakes found in the vicinity of Udaipur which connect with the Pichola lake and the Saroop Sagar Lake connected by an arched bridge built by Maharana Swaroop Singh (1842-1861) which in turn connects to the Fateh Sagar Lake, the crystal watered lake in the midst of tree lined hills and the smaller Arsi vilas.  Access  The Lake Pichola is approachable by road from the Udaipur City. Local buses, Tongas, auto-rickshaws and taxis provide the needed transport. Udaipur, in turn, is well connected through the Golden Quadrilateral road network, and it lies equidistant, at 650 kilometres, from Delhi and Mumbai on the National Highway (NH) 8. Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan is 6 hours by road and 3.5 hours drive from Ahmedabad to Udaipur. Rajasthan Tourism operates regular bus service from Delhi. It also falls on the East West Corridor which starts from Porbandar and ends at Silchar and intersects the Golden Quadrilateral and a part of this is the stretch from Udaipur to Chittor. 24 km from the lake is the Dabok Airport which connects to Delhi and Bombay. Udaipur Railway Station and Maharana Pratap Bus Stand are both 3 km away from the Lake.  History  Pichola Lake was built in 1362 AD by Banjara, a gypsy \\"Banjara\\" tribesman who transported grain, during the reign of Maharana Lakha. Later, Maharana Udai Singh, impressed by the charm of this lake with the backdrop of green hills, founded the city of Udaipur on the banks of the lake and also enlarged the Lake by constructing a stone masonry dam in the Badipol region on the shore of the Lake. Udaipur Panorama from Jag Mandir Island The lake's surroundings and the several islands within the lake have been developed over the centuries, with palaces, marble temples, family mansions, bathing ghats or chabutaras (a raised platform, normally within a courtyard); some of the famous ones are the Lake Palace (now converted into a heritage hotel) in the middle of the lake also called the Pichola Palace (pictured) or Jag Nivas located on the Jag Island, the Jag Mandir, the Mohan Mandir (in the northeast corner of the lake built by Jagat Singh between 1628 and 1652), the City Palace of Udaipur (Bansi Ghat) from where boats ply to all other parts of the Lake, the Arsi Vilas Island, which is a sanctuary for birds and the Sitamata Game Sanctuary on the western shore of the Lake. At several locations where the lake narrows, ornamental arch bridges have been built to span the waterway between the banks. Prince Khurram who rebelled against Jahangir, sought refuge of the Mewar King Maharana Karan Singh II in 1623 and was housed in the partially completed Jag Mandir. Prince Khurram later usurped the Mughal Empire, took the title of Shah Jahan.  Natini’s curse  The Natini Chabutra, is a raised platform in a courtyard, built to commemorate a \\"natani\\" (tightrope walker) legend. Maharana Jawan Singh (1828–38), in an inebriated state, is stated to have assured a \\"natani\\" that half the kingdom of Mewar would be gifted to her if she crossed the lake over a tightrope stretched across the lake from a village on the west bank of the lake to the City Palace on the east bank. It is said that she was tricked since the rope got cut off before she was to reach the other end of the rope. The girl plunged into the lake and drowned. Before she died, it is believed that she cursed that the Maharana's family, who from then on would not have any direct descendants or heirs. This curse is claimed to have come true, since six Ranas out of the seven succeeding Jawan Singh were adopted sons. Octopussy, a 1983 James Bond film, was filmed in the precincts of the Lake Palace and other two palaces in Udaipur (Shiv Niwas Palace and Monsoon Palace).  Hydrology and technical details  The Sisarma stream, a tributary of the Kotra River, drains a catchment of 55 km2 from the Aravalli Mountains and contributes to the flows in the lake. The average annual rainfall in the lake basin is . The lake has a surface area of about 696 ha. It is long and wide, and has depth varying from a minimum of to a maximum of . In the heart of the Lake, a palace called the Lake Palace was built, which is now converted into a heritage palace hotel. This palace built in marble in 1746 by Maharana Jagat Singh II, 62nd successor to the royal dynasty of Mewar, spreads across the 1.6 ha (4 acres) island and is claimed to be as impressive as the Taj Mahal. At the southern end, a dam was built across the major tributary to facilitate the Banjara tribesman to ford the stream with animals carrying grains. After 1560, Maharana Udai Sing II strengthened the dam (to a height of 15.24 m) when he established the city of Udaipur around the picturesque Lake. Machchala Magra hill, to the south of the city palace complex, is part of the old city wall and the small fort of Eklinggarh and the temple. The fact that the Pichola lake was built by nomadic gypsies testifies that the rulers of Mewar encouraged people to build water harvesting structures. During drought conditions because of lower rainfall & degradation of the catchment the lake becomes dry (pictured). During the years 1998 to July 2005. the Lakes of Udaipur were reportedly dry. Udaipur Panorama with dried Lake Pichola  Water quality  According to a study carried out by the \\"Centre of Advanced Study in Geology\\", Punjab University, the water quality of the lake has a high sodium and Bicarbonate content, which is attributed to the continental weathering due to anthropogenic pressure (tourist influx), intense development activities in the basin area and untreated effluent from municipal and domestic sewage into the Lake. The semi arid conditions of the area, saline and alkaline soils/groundwater conditions and weathering of the silicate rock exposed in the drainage basin are assessed as the reasons for the supply of major ions. The report infers that > The increase in phosphate loading and consequent depletion of silica > suggests biological consumption of the latter. The observed chemical data of > the Pichola Lake was used to predict the mineral assemblages in the > carbonate and aluminosilicate system. It demonstrates that calcite and > dolomite are the possible minerals that are in equilibrium with the lake > water system and that the lake water chemistry is in the range of stability > of kaolinite The average of the pollution parameters recorded at random intervals during 2005-2006 as reported by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board in 2006 are: * Dissolved Oxygen 6.33 mg/L; pH Value No.8.27; BOD 2.66 mg/L; Nitrate 0.11 mg/L; Nitrite 0.0045 mg/L; Fecal Coliform 16 MPN/100; and Total Coliform 110 MPN/100. The assessment of quality status determined that water is polluted and needs remedial measures to be implemented to rectify the situation. Studies conducted by Jheel Sanrakshan Samiti (Udaipur Lake Conservation Society) – JSS - a Non Governmental Organization (NGO) set up in 1992 for Ecological, Limnological and Hydrological Conservation of Udaipur Lake System, has found growth of water hyacinth, the lake bottom is also covered with a thick mat of submerged vegetation, presence of floating micro algae which are detrimental to the public health, and also harbor varieties of harmful organisms. This degree of pollution makes chlorination and treatment by other chemicals ineffective to render the water potable.  Threats to the lake  Some of the issues identified as causes for deterioration of the Lake environment are: * Polluted due to disposal of sewerage directly into surface drains or surface water body * Large-scale and uncontrolled mining of marble and other minerals leading to heavy deforestation of hill slopes. * Catchment area degradation and soil erosion causing deposition of sediments into the Lake and disturbance to the ecosystem of the area. * Encroachments * Dumping of solid, liquid waste, destruction of submergence areas and over exploitation of water * Poor governance, and * Lack of citizens and stakeholders participation in management of the Lake * Due to deteriorated water quality, out of 42 species of fishes including Mahseer and all major carp fishes only 17 species of fishes have survived.  Lake restoration works  Steps undertaken to restore the lakes by the NGOs, such as JSS and concerned government organizations are: * Water hyacinth has been eradicated * Biological measures undertaken * Sewerage plan has been partly implemented. * Catchment area conservation of the Pichhola Watershed project of Rs 34.2 million covering an area of 12702 ha under funding of the Government of India is under implementation List of Lakes in India * List of lakes in India Gallery File:City Palace of Udaipur.jpgCity Palace on Lake Pichola File:Udaipur.jpgGhats on the lake File:Jagmandir Palace.jpgJag Mandir on Lake Pichola.

It is an artificial lake named after Maharana Fateh Singh of Udaipur and Mewar, constructed north-west of Udaipur, to the north of Lake Pichola in the 1680s. It is one of the four lakes of the Udaipur city; the other three being: the Lake Pichola (within the Udaipur town), Udai Sagar Lake, to the east of Udaipur, and Dhebar Lake or Jaisamand Lake, south east of Udaipur.\\"Udaipur Lakes, Lakes Udaipur, Lakes Of Udaipur, Pichhola lake, Fatahsagar Lake, Udaisagar Lake, Lake Pichola, Badi Lake, Rajsamand Lake \\". www.amazingudaipur.com. Within the confines of the Fatah Sagar Lake, there are three small islands; the largest of these is the Nehru Park ( area), which is a popular tourist attraction, the second island ( area) houses a public park with an impressive water-jet fountain, and the third island (1.2 km2 area) is the address for the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO). The Nehru park is accessible by inboard motor boats. The blue waters of the lake and the backdrop of the green mountains has given the soubriquet of ‘the second Kashmir’ to Udaipur . Udaipur Lake Conservation Society's reports indicate that the lake supports and sustains ground water recharge, drinking water, agricultural use, industrial use, ecological water availability and provides employment to 60% population of Udaipur.  History  Sunset over the lake Maharana Fateh Singh's hunting party in Udaipur In 1687, Maharana Jai Singh first constructed the lake but two hundred years later the earthen bund which formed the lake was washed away during floods, and thereafter Maharana Fateh Singh, in 1889, built the \\"Connaught Dam\\" on Lake Dewali to mark the visit of Duke of Connaught, son of Queen Victoria. The dam enlarged the lake, and it was later renamed, Fateh Sagar Lake.  Hydrology and structures  The runoff emerging from surrounding hills drains into this lake. The lake is pear-shaped and is encircled by the Aravalli hills on three sides with a straight gravity stone masonry dam on the eastern side which has a spillway to discharge flood flows during the monsoon season. Three causeways, one from Pichola Lake, the other from Madar Lake and the third one from Badi Lake lead to the Fateh Sagar Lake. There are three inlet channels, which feed the lake and an overflow section on the eastern side in the masonry dam of length. Monsoon rains are the main source of all water to the lake. Initially constructed as an irrigation scheme, it is now the second major source of drinking water to the city of Udaipur and the irrigation supplies have been discontinued. A canal from the Rang Sagar Lake connects to the Fateh Sagar Lake. A gate controlled canal further connects Fateh Sagar Lake with Lake Pichhola. The Northeastern embankment is known by three names viz., the Pal, the Drive, or Connaught Bund (bund means embankment). During drought conditions, when the rainfall is meager, water storage in the lake is insufficient to meet the needs. To prevent loss of water due to evaporation, cetyl alcohol (hexadecanol) is sprayed over the lake surface.  Water quality issues  Some of the water quality parameters reported relate to: * pH value, which varies from a maximum of 8.4 on the surface to a minimum of 7.8 at the bottom and with minimum value of 7.9 at depth * DO [mg/l] value varies from a maximum of 9.4 on the surface and minimum of 1.2 at the bottom, at 5 m depth the lowest value being 3.3. * Maximum Nitrogen Concentration (NO3-N [mg/L] ) of 0.941 at 1 m below the surface and 0.523 at the bottom of the lake have been reported. * The lake water is reported to be polymictic, and there is lack of true thermocline. Gradient is recorded to be poor, which results in frequent mixing, as experienced in many tropical lakes. * The lake water temperature varies from a minimum of in January to in June at the surface, and correspondingly at the bottom of the lake. Eutrophication has occurred in the lake due to algal bloom; the dominant species causing this are algae: Microcystis sp and submerged macrophytes. Urbanization around the lake has also degraded water quality, which is a risk to public health of the people who are dependent on the lake for their water supply requirements. Siltation has caused reduction of storage capacity. Increase in nutrient level is also taking place on account of leaching from agricultural activity in the marginal agricultural lands around the lake periphery. These are some of the reasons attributed for lake degradation. The Udaipur city, set around the lakes, with its numerous hotels catering to the large influx of tourists and a large number of residential complexes on the slopes of the lake, also add pollutants to the lake.  Flora  Within the lake water, the flora recorded consists of the following. Macrophytes that have merged in the lake, floating macrophytes, the submerged macrophytes and the Phytoplankton. The Biomass production due to macrophytes is reported to be a maximum of on the surface of the lake, with a minimum of 329 g/m² at the bottom. The biomass recorded due to plankton is reported to be at maximum during January, as at the surface and 23 g/L at the bottom of the lake. It is a low of 16 g/L at the surface and 1 at the bottom during July, during the rainy season. The lake's surroundings have sparse vegetation cover; however, several species of plants are found along the roads and the hills in the lake basin.  Fauna  The fauna recorded in the lake are the Zooplankton, Benthos and Fish. The economically important fishes reported are: C. punctatus, C. reba, Catla catla, L. calbasu, Channa marulius, Cirrhina mrigala, L. gonius, Labeo rohita, Tor khudree, and Wallago attu. A panoramic view of Fateh Sagar Lake  Lake restoration works  The first effort to desilt the lake and improve its water quantity was undertaken by local citizen groups and environmental conservation organizations. The shallow part of the lake was desilted through voluntary labour in the early 1970s. Udaipur Lake Conservation Society, a Non Governmental Organization (NGO) set up in 1992, has independently carried out studies of the problems of the lakes of Udaipur and has been continuously pressurizing the government agencies to take up several restoration schemes on the lakes of Udaipur, including Fatah Sagar Lake, some of which are reported to have been acted upon by the Rajasthan Government. The restoration works pursued are Limnological Conservation Works (introducing new varieties of fish species), Ecological Conservation Works (catchment area treatment), Hyacinth removal (through bio- control), lining of unlined canal from Moti Magri Hill to Fatah Sagar Lake, construction of sewage lines, institutional development in the form of creating Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the lakes, etc. It has appealed in the Rajasthan High Court, through Public Interest Litigations, seeking court's intervention on several issues concerning restoration of small lakes, land acquisition up to the High Flood Level (HFL) of the Lakes, Constitution of the Lake Development Authority (LDA) for Udaipur Lakes, etc. which are reported to have been upheld by the High Court Udaipur Observatory in Fatah Sagar Lake, when it is in a dry condition Government of India, under its National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) of the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoE&F;), has sanctioned in June 2008, projects for development of Fatah Sagar Lake in Udaipur at a cost of about US$10 million (Rs 42 crore) with central government sharing 70% of the costs and the balance 30% by the State government. This programme of NLCP envisages desilting of the lake area, installation of a sewage treatment plant, beautification of the adjacent area and installation of fountains, with a completion schedule of 18 months.  Access  A winding road with a peripheral protection stone wall on the lake side exists on the eastern shore of the lake. The entire circumference of the lake could be covered by road via Moti Magri Road, Fatah Sagar Drive, Rani Road and the winding road on the eastern side route to get a picturesque view of the lake, and the Aravali Hills surrounding it. Tongas (horse driven two wheelers), auto-rickshaws and taxis can be hired to reach the lake as well.  Festival  Every year a festival called the Hariyali Amavasya Mela (Green New Moon Fair) is organized at the lake precincts, in the month of Shravan (August/September).  Aquarium  'Under The Sun' Aquarium in Udaipur. Fateh Sagar also houses an aquarium known as 'Under The Sun'. This aquarium, built under the Fatehsagar Paal, showcases over 200 species of fishes brought from 16 countries across the world. It was inaugurated on 21 October 2017.  Events  Fateh Sagar is popular destination for organizing various national and international events. Recently, it was a venue for the first edition of India's first World Music Festival, a two-day festival held on 13 and 14 February. Performances were made by artists and musicians from more than 12 countries, including Spain, Ghana, Venezuela, Italy, France as well as India.

The Moderne-style building was constructed of reinforced concrete, faced predominantly with beige brick and trimmed with limestone. On some facades smooth concrete predominates as the finish surface. The building had a smokestack that was painted to resemble a roll of Necco Wafers; this was removed in 1996 because it was unstable. During the alterations of the property for use by Novartis, the water tower was retained, and is now painted with a DNA pattern in NECCO pastel colors. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Company history The New England Confectionary Company was formed in 1901 by the merger of three Boston-area confectioners. One of these, Ball and Fobes, had in 1860 acquired another competitor whose equipment included precursors to those used to manufacture Necco Wafers. Ball and Fobes developed methods to print writing on hard candies. It was built in 1925-27 to serve as the company's sole manufacturing facility, replacing earlier facilities (which are now part of the Fort Point Channel Historic District) in Boston, and was at the time the world's largest candy factory.

In response, a number of temporary arrangements were attempted, but proved to be less than optimal; finally, in 1831, an independent Board of Revenue and a separate Sadr Diwani and Nizamat Adalat (Chief Civil and Criminal Courts) were created for these provinces. In 1833, an Act of the British Parliament (statute 3 and 4, William IV, cap. 85) concurrently promulgated the division of the Bengal Presidency, the elevation the Ceded and Conquered Provinces to the new Presidency of Agra, and the appointment of a new Governor for the latter. However, the plan was never carried out, and in 1835 another Act of Parliament (statute 5 and 6, William IV, cap. 52) renamed the region the North Western Provinces, this time to be administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, the first of whom, Sir Charles Metcalfe, would be appointed in 1836.

Following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake the previous Christchurch Central Library building was demolished, and was replaced by a new central library building in Cathedral Square, Tūranga, which opened in 2018. Early history The library began as the Mechanics' Institute in 1859, when 100 subscribers leased temporary premises in the then Town Hall. The collection consisted of a few hundred books. By 1863, with the help of a grant from the Provincial Government, the Mechanics' Institute opened a building on a half-acre of freehold land on the corner of Cambridge Terrace and Hereford Street, purchased the year before at a cost of £262.10.0. This site was to remain the home of the library until 1982. Debt, dwindling subscribers and other problems forced the Institute to hand over the building to the Provincial Government in 1873. By this time the collection numbered some 5,000 volumes, and was placed by the Province under the control of the new Canterbury College (later University). With the abolition of the provinces in 1876, the library became the property of the College, ratified by an Act of Parliament in 1878. College years Canterbury College controlled the library for over 70 years. Despite continual financial problems the bookstock and service continued to develop during most of the time. Growth Francis Stedman was the first official librarian (1876–1891), although he divided his time between the library and the College, where he was also registrar. By 1881 Stedman had increased the bookstock to 15,000 volumes. By 1898 when Alexander Cracroft Wilson (son of John Cracroft Wilson) was librarian (1891–1906) the stock had increased to nearly 30,000. Ten years later, under Howard Strong (1906–1913), the stock numbered over 40,000 volumes. This dramatic growth was partly due to the gift of James Gammack, who donated the income and rents from some of land to the library in his will in 1896. This enabled the college to demolish the original wooden Mechanics' Institute building in 1901 and replace it with a permanent material structure. Truly modern library service began under the librarianship of E. J. Bell (1913–1951). Bell classified the entire collection under the new Dewey Decimal system (still in use) by 1914, and opened a children's section that same year. In 1918, with the support of the Canterbury Progress League, a Technical Library was opened. Two years later a travelling library service to country districts began, a service that continued until the establishment of the nationwide Country Library Service in 1938. In 1924 a new wing of the library was opened including a separate children's room. A new heating unit was installed that same year. The 1930s saw a decline in the service to the public due to the Great Depression, although in 1935 the Canterbury Public Library Journal was started. If in 1940 some 1,500 people a day were using the library, the bookstock had scarcely increased since the 1920s. Canterbury College was finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the library in any form. Ever since the 1880s it had held discussions with the Christchurch City Council with a view to handing over control of the library to the council, but it had proved impossible to reach final agreement. In 1936 the council agreed in principle to take over the library, and made its first grant towards its upkeep. Control of the library was passed to the council by the Canterbury Public Library Act 1948, and ownership was formally transferred in late 1948. Council control Under a new librarian, R. O'Reilly, (1951–1968), the sheaf catalogue was transferred to a card system. The library became free in 1952, although a modest charge was retained for some popular books. The bookstock expanded rapidly, and new services became available for the first time. In 1953, the library began purchasing prints and original works of art for loan. This collection now includes original works by some of New Zealand's best known contemporary painters, including Colin McCahon, Sir Tosswill Woolaston, Rita Angus and Doris Lusk. In 1942 Dr J.C. Bradshaw had bequeathed 600 volumes of music manuscripts to the library. Under O'Reilly this collection was expanded, and in 1955 the library began purchasing and lending recordings, a collection that is now an outstanding catalogue of serious music. The dramatic expansion of services and stock required extensive alterations to the buildings. A floor was added to the old Reference Library and the New Zealand room was opened in 1956. A bindery was opened in 1952 to repair existing stock and stiffen new books and periodicals. To supplement the collections of existing volunteer suburban libraries the Suburban Extension Division was started in 1958. The first branch library, at Spreydon, was opened in 1971, and has since been followed by branches at New Brighton, Papanui, Shirley and a mobile library. A further branch is planned for Linwood to complete the suburban network. Following O'Reilly's departure in 1968 services continued to expand under his successor John Stringleman.\\"John Edwin Denys Stringleman (1921–1995)\\", 150th anniversary website The stock has grown to nearly 400,000 books, used by over 90,000 registered borrowers. Subject areas include Children's, Social Sciences and Humanities, Commerce, Science and Technology, and a fine New Zealand collection. New services continued into the 1970s. Paperbacks were introduced in 1973, along with a housebound readers' service (Storyline) and a collection of books for adult new readers. SATIS, a technical information service for business firms, was begun in 1977 as a cooperative venture between Government and city. Technology The library was the first public library in New Zealand to use a computerised lending system (1975). Late 2000s By the late 1960s it was obvious that site on the corner of Cambridge Terrace and Hereford Street could not cope with the library's growth, although some temporary accommodation was achieved with the addition of a mezzanine floor in 1970 and a prefabricated annex in 1975. In 1974 a new site was chosen on the corner of Gloucester Street and Oxford Terrace, and Warren and Mahoney chosen as architects. The next seven years saw the planning and development of this new home, with Charles Luney as the builder. Christchurch Central Library was opened to the public on 12 January 1982. By the 1960s the adjoining local bodies of Waimairi District Council and Paparua County Council had also established professional library services, and these, with the central and community libraries, formed the new Canterbury Public Library network following local government reorganisation in 1989. Canterbury Public Library celebrated 50 years of unity with the Christchurch City Council in October 1998. To mark the occasion, the library held a number of events, including a parade for information literacy in which over 700 people from various organisations, schools and community groups participated. In July 2000 Canterbury Public Library adopted a new name, Christchurch City Libraries. A new brand and logo were also launched to reflect the new name and the increasing range of services offered. In March 2006 Christchurch City amalgamated with the Banks Peninsula District and the four Banks Peninsula libraries (Akaroa, Diamond Harbour, Little River and Lyttelton) became part of Christchurch City Libraries. Since the 2011 earthquake The Gloucester Street central library building was extensively damaged during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and has now been demolished to make way for a new convention centre. In its place, a new Central Library design was approved. While it was being built, two temporary central libraries operated in 87–91 Peterborough Street. and 36 Manchester Street. The new central library is on the corner of Cathedral Square. Named \\"Tūranga\\", this new building was opened on 12 October 2018 at a completed cost of NZ$92 million.

Although fires kill large woody stems and the species does not reproduce by rhizomes or root sprouts, it sprouts readily after fire. As a result, the total number of stems does not change, but fire converts S. caroliniana from a tree into a shrub. Salix caroliniana flowers in the early spring, either before or together with the emergence of leaves. In Alachua County, Florida in 1982, flowering was recorded during February and March. The species was first described by French naturalist André Michaux in 1803 in his Flora Boreali- Americana.Salix caroliniana Michx. Tropicos. The male flowers provide much spring pollen for bees.

Walker was born into slavery in North Carolina in 1818 and escaped to freedom in 1848. After the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, she moved to Milton, Massachusetts before settling in the Pratt House in 1870, which was purchased from the daughter of Dexter Pratt.

It was then purchased in 1947 by a group of women including Elsa Brändström Ulich as the new location of The Window Shop, which hired refugees and immigrants, and may have been the first business in Harvard Square to employ African American women.

Dubbed the Queen of Lesbian Romance,Journal of Lesbian Studies, 2001 she publishes exclusively in the lesbian market as a matter of personal choice.In Their Own Words: Lesbian Writers on their Inspiration, AfterEllen.com, 5/26/2008  Early life and education  Kallmaker was born in 1960 in Sacramento, California. She graduated from California State University, Sacramento with a B.A. in Business Administration in 1988.  Lesbian romance novels  Considered a master at characterization,Lambda Book Report, Vol. 14, Issue 2, Summer 2006 Kallmaker's work reflects the interior lives of her lesbian heroines, set primarily in romance novel situations. \\"Credible and spiritedBibliophile's Bounty, Bay Area Reporter, 12/18/97\\" protagonists also face contemporary social challenges, resulting in a body of work that reflects lesbian community history since her debut novel, In Every Port (1989), which included events surrounding the assassination of Harvey Milk in 1978. Her second novel, Touchwood, established her as a writer with \\"a sure sense of the power of language and of the power of eros.The Age Thing, Bay Area Reporter, 7/1/1990\\" Her typical heroine is \\"the kind of indestructible and talented woman we all dream we could be -- much like Molly Bolt in Rubyfruit Jungle.Lesbian Review of Books, Winter, 2000.\\" In spite of publishing the majority of her work as lesbian romance genre fiction, \\"there's something original to every bookGay Power, Lesbian Lust and Literary Trash, San Francisco Bay Times, 9/21/2006\\", featuring \\"complex stories of believable, vulnerable lesbian characters who grow strong through facing tough issues.Midwest Book Review, 4/3/2003\\" Deeply influenced by mentor Katherine V. Forrest as an emerging writer, her fifth novel, Painted Moon, was hailed as \\"the next Curious Wine,Lesbian Review of Books, Summer, 1995\\" and remains one of her most popular novels, fifteen years after its original publication. Crediting Jane Austen as a foremother of the modern novel,Author's Blog Romance and Chocolate, \\"Becoming Jane, Thoughts,\\" 8/14/2007 Kallmaker's Just Like That is a lesbian version of Pride and Prejudice. Another homage-by- genre-twist novel is Christabel, inspired by the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem of the same name. Written initially under the pen name Laura Adams, Kallmaker dedicated the novelChristabel frontis dedication. Naiad Press, 1997; Bella Books 2008. to Jeannette Howard Foster for her examination of the lesbian subtext, moving her to retell the story with the women triumphant. Her ability to push the boundaries of genre fiction while maintaining her popularity is epitomized by Maybe Next Time, \\"an engrossing, compelling story of redemption, healing and surviving,Midwest Book Review, 1/11/2004\\" which won a Lambda Literary Award. Her novels include the Golden Crown Literary Society and Lambda Literary Foundation award-winning 18th & Castro, In Deep Waters 1/2, Just Like That, The Kiss that Counted, Maybe Next Time, and Sugar. Her writing career began with Naiad Press, one of the shaping publishers of lesbian fiction. In 2001, she placed her work as Laura Adams with a new press, Bella Books. After Naiad Press closed in 2003, she moved the remainder of her lesbian romance titles to Bella. In 2008, she joined Bella Books as the press's first Editorial Director, and retired from that position in 2015.  Short stories and essays  A \\"cleverly inventiveFrosting on the Cake, Bay Windows, 3/23/2002\\" short story writer, she has published more than five dozen short stories in collections from her own publishers, as well as anthologies from publishers such as Alyson, Regal Crest Enterprises, Circlet Press, Bold Strokes Books, and Haworth Press. The genre of her stories go from vanilla romance to explicit erotica. In a May 2006 interview with Q Syndicate, Kallmaker discussed some of the resistance she faced to the idea that a romance writer could also write erotica. \\"...Part of my goal for writing erotica was to decriminalize lesbian sex for lesbians, especially those in committed couples and those who don't live in an urban Mecca with an out-and- proud sex-positive attitude.Interview for Q Syndicate, by Joy Parks, May 2006\\" Volumes containing her lesbian erotica short stories have won awards from the Golden Crown Literary Society and the Lambda Literary Foundation. Published essays have dealt with issues of identity for the author. In 1993, she wrote \\"When I Grow Up I Want to Be a Lesbian\\" for Multicultural America: A Resource Book for Teachers of Humanities and American Studies, which explored the disconnect between different stages of coming out, when she first observed the community but did not yet feel a member of it. Ten years later, after the birth of her two children: \\"For many years I was, by all outward appearances, a suburban married woman.Kallmaker, Karin in \\"Dangling Earrings\\" from Milk of Human Kindness: Lesbian Daughters Write About Their Mothers (Lori L.

Forrest and Jim Van Buskirk, eds.). Alyson.\\"  Science fiction and fantasy novels as Laura Adams  As Laura Adams, Kallmaker has written lesbian science-fiction and fantasy titles that include a \\"chilling brush with reality.Lesbian Review of Books, IV.4, Summer, 1998.\\" Though the novels include strong lesbian romance storylines, their themes revolve around the power of lesbian community and spirituality.  Writing career  Kallmaker has 18 years of experience with non-profit financial management. Workplaces, such as an association of home and health care service providers to the elderly, a private lender investing in projects to benefit low income people, and a half-year at an oil refinery, have provided background for many of her novels.Kallmaker, Karin.

Although it is similar to self-disclosure in that it involves revealing and discussing a problem, it is more focused on the problems themselves and thus can be maladaptive. While self-disclosure is seen as a positive aspect found in close friendships, some types of self-disclosure can also be maladaptive. Co-rumination is a type of behavior that is positively correlated with both rumination and self-disclosure and has been linked to a history of anxiety because co-ruminating may exacerbate worries about whether problems will be resolved, about negative consequences of problems, and depressive diagnoses due to the consistent negative focus on troubling topics, instead of problem- solving. However, co-rumination is also closely associated with high-quality friendships and closeness. Developmental psychology and gender differences Girls are more likely than boys to co-ruminate with their close friends, and co-rumination increases with age in children. Female adolescents are more likely to co-ruminate than younger girls, because their social worlds become increasingly complex and stressful. This is not true for boys, however as age differences are not expected among boys because their interactions remain activity focused and the tendency to extensively discuss problems is likely to remain inconsistent with male norms. Unfortunately, while providing this support, this tendency may also reinforce internalizing problems such as anxiety or depression, especially in adolescent girls,Siegler, Robert (2006). How Children Develop, Exploring Child Develop Student Media Tool Kit & Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop. New York: Worth Publishers. . which may account for higher depression among girls than boys. For boys, lower levels of co-rumination may help buffer them against emotional problems if they spend less time with friends dwelling on problems and concerns, though less sharing of personal thoughts and feelings can potentially interfere with creating high-quality friendships. Co-rumination has been found to partially explain (or mediate) gender differences in anxiety and depression; females have reported engaging in more co-rumination in close friendships than males, as well as elevated co-rumination was associated with females' higher levels of depression, but not anxiety. Co-rumination is also linked with romantic activities, which have been shown to correlate with depressive symptoms over time, because they are often the problem discussed among adolescents. Research suggests that within adolescents, children who currently exhibit high levels of co-rumination would predict the onset of depressive diagnoses than in children who exhibit lower levels of co- rumination. In addition, this link was maintained even when children with current diagnoses were excluded, as well as statistically controlling for current depressive symptoms. This further suggests that the relation between co-rumination and a history of depressive diagnoses is not due simply to current levels of depression. Another study looking at 146 adolescents (69% female) ranging in age from 14 to 19 suggests that comparing gender differences in co-rumination across samples, it appears as if these differences intensify through early adolescence but begin to narrow shortly thereafter and remain steady through emerging adulthood Stress hormones, co- rumination and depression Co-rumination, or talking excessively about each other's problems, is common during adolescent years, especially among girls, as mentioned before. On a biological basis, a study has shown that there is an increase in the levels of stress hormones during co-rumination. This suggests that since stress hormones are released during co-rumination, they may also be released in greater amounts during other life stressors. If someone exhibits co-rumination in response to a life problem it may become more and more common for them to co-ruminate about all problems in their life. Studies have also shown that co-rumination can predict internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Since co-rumination involves repeatedly going over problems again and again this clearly may lead to depression and anxiety. Catastrophizing, when one takes small possibilities and blows them out of proportion into something negative, is common in depression and anxiety and may very well be a result of constantly going over problems that may not be as bad as they seem. Co-rumination, that tends to develop the emotional bonds between participants is also a method used by therapy cults to draw in members and increase attachment to the abusive group while at the same time damaging other relationships that may be being discussed (e.g. the members own family). Effects in daily life Co-rumination, or lack thereof, leads to different behaviors in daily life. For example, studies have examined the link between co-rumination and weekly drinking habits, specifically, negative thoughts. Worry co-rumination leads to less drinking weekly, while angry co-rumination leads to a significant increase in drinking. There have also been some gender differences found as well in the same study. In general, negative co- rumination increased the likelihood that women would binge drink weekly, versus men who would drink less weekly. When dealing with specific negative emotions, women drank less when taking part in worry co-rumination (as opposed to other negative emotions), while there appeared to be a lack of significant difference in men. (Ciesla et al., 2011) Therapy Co-rumination treatment typically consists of cognitive emotion regulation therapy for rumination with the patient. This therapy focuses both on the patient themselves and their habits of continually co-ruminating with a friend or friends. Therapies may need to be altered depending on the gender of each patient. As suggested by Zlomke and Hahn (2010) men showed vast improvement in anxiety and worrying symptoms by focusing their attention on how to handle a negative event through \\"refocus on planning\\". For women, accepting a negative event/emotion and re- framing it in a positive light was associated with decreased levels of worry. In other words, some of the cognitive emotion regulation strategies that work for men do not necessarily work for women and vice versa. Patients are encouraged to talk about their problems with friends and family members, but need to focus on a solution instead of focusing on the exact problem. Types of relationships While the majority of studies have been conducted with youth same-sex friendships, others have explored co-rumination and correlates of co-rumination within other types of relationships. Research on co- rumination in the workplace has shown that discussions about workplace problems have led to mixed results, especially regarding gender differences. In high abusive supervision settings, the effects of co-rumination were shown to intensify its negative effects for women, while associating lower negative effects for men. In low abusive supervision settings, results show that there were no significant effects for women, but had negative outcomes for men. The study suggests the reason men are at risk for job dissatisfaction and depression in low stress supervision, is due to the gender differences at an early age. At a young age, girls report to co-ruminate more than boys, and as they age girls' scores tend to rise, while boys' scores tend to drop. The study further suggests that in adulthood, men have less experience with co- rumination than women, however some men may learn skills through interacting with women or the interaction style with other men in adulthood has changed from activity-based to conversation-based; suggesting that not only do men and women co-ruminate differently, but that the level of stress may be a factor as well. In another study, co-rumination was seen to increase the negative effects of burnout on perceived stress among co-workers, thereby indicating that, while co-rumination may be seen as a socially-supportive interaction, it could have negative psychological outcomes for co-workers. Within the context of mother-adolescent relationships, a study that examines 5th, 8th, and 11th graders has found greater levels of co-rumination among mother and daughter than mother and son relationships. In addition, mother-adolescent co- rumination was related to positive relationship quality, but also to enmeshment which was unique to co-rumination. These enmeshment as well as internalizing relations were strongest when co-ruminating was focused on the mother's problems. Other relationships have also been studied. For instance, one study found that graduate students engage in co-rumination. Furthermore, for those graduate students, co-rumination acted as a partial mediator, which suppressed the positive effects of social support on emotional exhaustion. Primary Researchers Researchers in psychology and communication have studied the conceptualization of co-rumination along with the effects of the construct. A few primary researchers have focused attention on the construct including Amanda Rose Professor of Psychology at the University of Missouri, who was one of the first scholars to write about the construct. Others who are doing work on co-rumination include Justin P. Boren, Associate Professor of Communication at Santa Clara University, Jennifer Byrd-Craven, Associate Professor of Psychology at Oklahoma State University, and Dana L.

Early life Born in Morlaix, Finistère, Le Goaziou studied at the high school in Saint-Pol-de-Léon, pursuing university studies at the Sorbonne where he took a degree in philosophy. Le Goaziou became a member of Le Sillon (\\"The Path\\"), a leftist Catholic movement created by Marc Sangnier. Returning to Brittany in 1910, he participated in the creation of an agricultural cooperative in Saint-Pol-de-Leon which brought together potato farmers. At the beginning of World War I, he joined the French army. He was wounded in battle in 1916.Jean-Loup Avril, Mille Bretons, dictionnaire biographique, Les Portes du Large, Saint-Jacques-de-la-Lande, 2003, () He moved to Quimper in 1919 where he opened a bookstore and began to work as a publisher, specialising in literature on regional issues. Though a supporter of regional culture, Le Goaziou opposed the Breton autonomist and nationalist movements of the time. World War II After the Fall of France in 1940, he protested against the nationalist and collaborationist weekly L'Heure Bretonne. He also opposed the foundation of the Breton Celtic Institute, which was created under the patronage of the Germans in 1941 at the instigation of German Celticist Leo Weisgerber. Le Goaziou became president of the Union of Religious Bookstores and the Booksellers' Union of France. Involved in the Resistance, he was denounced and arrested by the Gestapo in October 1943, but released in April 1944 for lack of evidence. A report by two police inspectors dated December 5, 1943, indicate connections with François Jaffrennou, who allegedly accused Le Goaziou and a colleague of being \\"the leaders of the [Resistance] movement in Brittany\\" and \\"friends\\" of England. In April 1944, after the Liberation of France, Le Goaziou was appointed chairman of the Departmental Committee of liberation, for the Finistère region. He took part in the creation of Ouest- France, which followed the closure of Ouest-Éclair, banned by Liberation forces for collaborationism. He also created a monthly magazine, Nouvelle Revue de Bretagne which appeared from 1947 to 1953. Notable publications *A.

Sabina published many articles (several of which were censored) to magazines during this period.  Imprisonment  In 1849 he was arrested for taking part in the \\"May Coup\\" (a plan to make an uprising, inspired by Bakunin, then present in Prague)1849 and in 1851 sentenced to death together with 24 other men; but these sentences were changed by the Emperor to 18 years in the Olomouc prison; in 1857 he was released, following the Emperor's general amnesty of May 8. He came back to Prague and lived as a freelance writer.  Allegations of betrayal  In 1870 the newspaper Vaterland accused Sabina of being a police informant. Sabina successfully sued the newspaper for a libel. In 1872, in an unofficial trial by a self-appointed jury of eight Czech intellectuals (including Jan Neruda and Vítězslav Hálek), Karel Sabina was found guilty of being an informant. Sabina, unable to find exile abroad, was forced to live in hiding in Prague. For the rest of his life, Karel Sabina denied the accusations.Karel Sabina The reasons of Sabina's alleged cooperation with the police are not quite clear; if it happened, it might have been a combination of disillusion with the failed revolution which resulted in his long imprisonment, constant police pressure afterwards and his extreme poverty.Karel Sabina Being an outcast - his books were no longer sold, on posters (such as the one for the Prodaná nevěsta - whose libretto was seen by some people as Sabina's refutation of the accusations until Miroslav Ivanov's investigation in 1971 published in Ivanov's book Labyrint proved them incorrect) his name was replaced by his initials, and he risked physical attacks whenever he appeared on the streets. However, he continued to write under pen names, some of which are unknown today, thus greatly complicating the historians' effort to make Sabina's bibliography of articles complete.  Death  Sabina died in poverty and scorn in 1877, the general exhaustion being given as the cause of death.  Selected works  As a journalist, he wrote mainly for Květy, Moravský Týdenník, Humorist, Lípa, Pražské noviny and Wčela (he was an editor in the last two, replacing Karel Havlíček Borovský in both of them).

Obeying the rules and conforming to socially accepted behaviors (such as stopping at a \\"Stop\\" sign or paying for groceries) are also regarded as prosocial behaviors. These actions may be motivated by empathy and by concern about the welfare and rights of others,Sanstock, John W. A Topical Approach to Life Span Development 4th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007. Ch. 15, pp. 489–491 as well as for egoistic or practical concerns, such as one's social status or reputation, hope for direct or indirect reciprocity, or adherence to one's perceived system of fairness. It may also be motivated by altruism, though the existence of pure altruism is somewhat disputed, and some have argued that this falls into philosophical rather than psychological realm of debate. Evidence suggests that pro sociality is central to the well- being of social groups across a range of scales, including schools. Prosocial behavior in the classroom can have a significant impact on a student's motivation for learning and contributions to the classroom and larger community.Straubhaar, Joseph D., Robert LaRose, and Lucinda Davenport. Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, 2009. pp. 427–28 . In the workplace, prosocial behaviour can have a significant impact on team psychological safety, as well as positive indirect effects on employee's helping behaviors and task performance. Empathy is a strong motive in eliciting prosocial behavior, and has deep evolutionary roots. Prosocial behavior fosters positive traits that are beneficial for children and society. It helps many beneficial functions by bettering production of any league and its organizational scale. Evolutionary psychologists use theories such as kin-selection theory and inclusive fitness as an explanation for why prosocial behavioral tendencies are passed down generationally, according to the evolutionary fitness displayed by those who engaged in prosocial acts. Encouraging prosocial behavior may also require decreasing or eliminating undesirable social behaviors. Although the term \\"prosocial behavior\\" is often associated with developing desirable traits in children, the literature on the topic has grown since the late 1980s to include adult behaviors as well.Prosocial Behavior. Excerpt from \\"More about Generosity: An Addendum to the Generosity, Social Psychology and Philanthropy Literature Reviews\\" , University of Notre Dame, July 7, 2009 The term \\"prosocial\\" has grown into a world-wide movement, using evolutionary science to create real-world pro-social changes from working groups to our whole culture. Origin of the term According to the psychology researcher C. Daniel Batson, the term \\"was created by social scientists as an antonym for antisocial.\\"Altruism and prosocial behavior CD Batson… – Handbook of psychology, 1998 – Wiley Online Library. Scholar.google.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-08. Reciprocity vs. altruism in motivation The purest forms of prosocial behavior are motivated by altruism, an unselfish interest in helping another person. According to Santrock,Santrock, John W. A Topical Approach to Life Span Development 4th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007. Ch 15. pp. 489–491 the circumstances most likely to evoke altruism are empathy for an individual in need, or a close relationship between the benefactor and the recipient. However, many prosocial behaviors that appear altruistic are in fact motivated by the norm of reciprocity, which is the obligation to return a favor with a favor. People feel guilty when they do not reciprocate and they may feel angry when someone else does not reciprocate. Reciprocal altruism suggests that \\"such helping is driven by a genetic tendency\\".Dickerson, P. Social Psychology Traditional and Critical Perspectives. Pearson, 2012. Chapter 8. Thus some professionals argue that altruism may not exist, and is completely motivated by reciprocity.Pinel, John P.J. Biopsychology 8th Edition. New York: Pearson, 2011. Chapter 17. Either reciprocity or altruism may motivate many important prosocial behaviors, including sharing. Situational and individual factors Prosocial behavior is mediated by both situational and individual factors. Situational factors One of the most common situation factors is the occurrence of the bystander effect. The bystander effect is the phenomenon that an individual's likelihood of helping decreases when passive bystanders are present in a critical situation. For example, when someone drops a stack of papers on a crowded sidewalk, most people are likely to continue passing him/her by. This example can be extended to even more urgent situations, such as a car crash or natural disaster. The decision model of bystander intervention noted that whether or not an individual gives aid in a situation depends upon their analysis of the situation. An individual will consider whether or not the situation requires their assistance, if the assistance is the responsibility of the individual, and how to help.Latane, B., & Darley, J. 1970. The unresponsive bystander: Why doesn't he help? New York: Appleton- Century-Crofts. This model, proposed by Latane and Darley,Latane, B., & Darley, J. 1970 describes five things that must occur in order for a person to intervene: #Notice the situation #Construe it as an emergency. #Develop feelings of responsibility. #Believe they have skills to succeed. #Reach a conscious decision to help. The number of individuals present in the situation requiring help is also a mediating factor in one's decision to give aid, where the more individuals are present, the less likely it is for one particular individual to give aid due to a reduction in perceived personal responsibility. This is known as diffusion of responsibility, where the responsibility one feels for the person(s) in need is divided by the number of bystanders. Another factor that comes into play is evaluation apprehension, which simply refers to the fear of being judged by other bystanders. Finally, pluralistic ignorance may also lead to someone not intervening. This refers to relying on the reaction of others, before reacting yourself. Additionally, Piliavin et al., (1981) noted that individuals are likely to maximize their rewards and minimize their costs when determining whether or not to give aid in a situation – that is, that people are rationally self-motivated. Prosocial behavior is more likely to occur if the cost of helping is low (i.e. minimal time, or minimal effort), if helping would actually benefit the individual providing the help in some way, and if the rewards of providing the help are large. If it is in an individual's interest to help, they will most likely do so, especially if the cost of not providing the help is great.Dovidio, J.F., Piliavin, J.A., Gaertner, S.L., Schroeder, D.A. & Clark, R.D., III. (1991). The arousal: Cost-reward model and the process of intervention. In M.S. Clark (Ed.) Review of personality and social psychology: Vol. 12: Prosocial behaviour. pp. 86–118. Newbury Park, CA: Sage. People are also more likely to help those in their social group, or their \\"in group\\". With a sense of shared identity with the individual requiring assistance, the altruist is more likely to provide help, on the basis that one allocates more time and energy towards helping behavior within individuals of their own group. The labeling of another individual as a member of one's \\"in-group\\" leads to greater feelings of closeness, emotional arousal, and a heightened sense of personal responsibility for the other's welfare, all of which increase the motivation to act prosocially. Researchers have also found that social exclusion decreases the likelihood of prosocial behavior occurring. In a series of seven experiments conducted by Twenge et al., (2007) researchers manipulated social inclusion or exclusion by telling research participants that other participants had purposefully excluded them, or that they would probably end up alone later in life. They found that this preliminary social exclusion caused prosocial behavior to drop significantly, noting that \\"Socially excluded people donated less money to a student fund, were unwilling to volunteer for further lab experiments, were less helpful after a mishap, and cooperated less in a mixed-motive game with another student.\\" This effect is thought to be due to the fact that prosocial behavior, again, is motivated by a sense of responsibility in caring for and sharing resources with members of one's own group. Individual factors Individuals can be compelled to act prosocially based on learning and socialization during childhood. Operant conditioning and social learning positively reinforces discrete instances of prosocial behaviors. Cognitive capacities like intelligence for example, are almost always related to prosocial likings. Helping skills and a habitual motivation to help others is therefore socialized, and reinforced as children understand why helping skills should be used to help others around them. Social and individual standards and ideals also motivate individuals to engage in prosocial behavior. Social responsibility norms, and social reciprocity norms reinforce those who act prosocially. As an example, consider the child who is positively reinforced for \\"sharing\\" during their early childhood years. When acting prosocially, individuals reinforce and maintain their positive self-images or personal ideals, as well as help to fulfill their own personal needs. The correlation between a helper's state and helping tendencies are greatly restricted to the relationship between whomever takes part in the situation. Emotional arousal is an additional important motivator for prosocial behavior in general. Batson's (1987) empathy-altruism model examines the emotional and motivational component of prosocial behavior. Feeling empathy towards the individual needing aid increases the likelihood that the aid will be given. This empathy is called \\"empathetic concern\\" for the other individual, and is characterized by feelings of tenderness, compassion, and sympathy. Agreeableness is thought to be the personality trait most associated with inherent prosocial motivation. Prosocial thoughts and feelings may be defined as a sense of responsibility for other individuals, and a higher likelihood of experiencing empathy (\\"other-oriented empathy\\") both affectively (emotionally) and cognitively. These prosocial thoughts and feelings correlate with dispositional empathy and dispositional agreeableness.Penner, Louis A., Barbara A. Fritzsche, J. Philip Craiger, and Tamara R. Freifeld. 1995.\\"Measuring the Prosocial Personality.\\" pp. 147–163 in J. Butcher and C.D. Spielberger (Eds.) Advances in Personality Assessment, Vol. 10. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Other factors In addition to situational and individualistic factors, there are some categorical characteristics that can impact prosocial behavior. Several studies have indicated a positive relationship between prosocial behavior and religion. The article sounds a note of caution, however, for two reasons. Firstly, \\"it remains unresolved whether this charity gap persists beyond the ingroup boundaries of the religious groups\\"; secondly, and more importantly, the sociological surveys that suggest such a gap \\"are entirely based on self-reports of prosocial behavior. Psychologists have long known that self-reports of socially desirable behaviors (such as charitability) may not be accurate, reflecting instead impression management and self-deception.\\" In addition, there may be sex differences in prosocial behavior, particularly as youths move into adolescence. Research suggests that while women and men both engage in prosocial behaviors, women tend to engage in more communal and relational prosocial behaviors whereas men tend to engage in more agentic prosocial behaviors. A recent study examining workplace charitable giving looked at the role of both sex and ethnicity. Results showed that women gave significantly more than men, and Caucasians gave significantly more than minority groups. However, the percent of minority individuals in the workplace was positively associated with workplace charitable giving by minorities. Culture, sex, and religion are important factors to consider in understanding prosocial behavior on an individual and group level. In childhood through early adolescence Prosocial behavior in childhood often begins with questions of sharing and fairness. From age 12–18 months, children begin to display prosocial behavior in presenting and giving their toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise.Parke R, Gauvain M, Schmuckler, M. Child Development: A contemporary view point, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 2010, pages=552–553 The development of prosocial behavior continues throughout the second year of life, as children begin to gain a moral understanding of the world. As obedience to societal standards becomes important, children's ability to exhibit prosocial behavior strengthens, with occurrence and diversity of these behaviors increasing with age and cognitive maturity. What is important developmentally is that the child has developed a belief that sharing is an obligatory part of a social relationship and involves a question of right and wrong. So, as children move through childhood, their reasoning changes from being hedonistic and needs-oriented to becoming more concerned with approval and more involved in complex cognitive forms of perspective taking and reciprocity reasoning.Eisenberg, 1991 Additionally, children's prosocial behavior is typically more centered around interest in friends and concern for approval, whereas adolescents begin to develop reasoning that is more concerned with abstract principles such as guilt and positive affect. Parents can set examples that children carry into their interactions and communication with peers, but parents are not present during all of their children's peer exchanges. The day-to-day constructions of fairness standards is done by children in collaboration and negotiation with each other. Recent research demonstrates that invoking the self using subtle linguistic cues (e.g. identifying someone as a \\"helper\\" versus labeling the action, \\"helping\\") fosters the perception that a behavior reflects identity, and increases helping, or prosocial, behaviors in children significantly across tasks. Another study by Nantel-Vivier et al. used a multi-informant model to investigate the development of prosocial behaviour in both Canadian and Italian adolescents aged 10–15. Their findings have indicated that, in early adolescence, although empathy and moral reasoning continue to advance, the development of prosocial behaviors reaches a plateau. Theories for this change in development suggest that it is the result of more individualized and selective prosocial behaviors. During adolescence, youth begin to focus these behaviors toward their peer groups and/or affiliations. Consistent with previous analyses, this study also found a tendency toward higher prosocial behaviors in young adolescent girls compared to their male classmates. The earlier maturation in females may be a possible explanation for this disparity. A more recent study that focused on the effects of pubertal timing found that early maturation in adolescents has a positive impact on prosocial behaviors. While their findings apply to both genders, this study found a much more pronounced effect in males. This suggests that earlier onset of puberty has a positive correlation with the development of prosocial behaviors. In many Indigenous American communities, prosocial behavior is a valued means of learning and child rearing. Such behaviors are seen as contributing in an eagerly collaborative and flexible environment, aimed at teaching consideration, responsibility, and skills with the guidance and support of adults. Culturally valued developmental goals are integrally tied to children's participation in these contexts. It is also helpful for children to learn cultural mores in addition to individual personality development. Children learn functional life skills through real-time observation of adults and interactive participation of these learned skills within their community. Prosocial development in school Prosocial behavior can act as a strong motivator in education, for it provides students with a purpose beyond themselves and the classroom. This purpose beyond the self, or self- transcendence,https://www.perts.net/static/documents/yeager_2014.pdf is an innate human need to be a part of something bigger than themselves. When learning in isolation, the way Western academics are traditionally designed, students struggle to make connections to the material and its greater overarching purpose. This disconnection harms student learning, motivation, and attitudes about education. If teachers make space for prosocial behavior in education and social learning, then they can illustrate that what students are learning will have a direct impact on the world that they live in. This would be considered a mutually constituting relationship, or a relationship in which both individuals and culture develop interdependently. In other words, what students are learning in a classroom could be intimately connected with a purpose towards a greater cause, deepening the learning itself. Studies by Yeager et al. test the effects of having a self-transcendent purpose for learning, with the results showing that such a purpose for learning led to fewer future college dropouts, increased high school math and science GPAs, and persistence on boring tasks. This self transcendent purpose may not only encourage persistence on boring tasks, but may help to make boring tasks more meaningful and engaging. A person's ideas and opinions are largely shaped by the world that they grow up in, which in turn determines what sort of change they want to instill in the world. For example: a girl who grew up in poverty becoming a social worker. The environment she grew up in gave her an awareness of the workings of poverty, motivating her to instill change in either the institutions that cause it, or help those affected by poverty. There aren't many opportunities to make prosocial contributions in school; which makes school feel isolated and irrelevant. By encouraging students to find a self- transcendent purpose in their learning, we enable them to enjoy their learning and make connections to community contributions. Influence of media programming and video games on children Studies have shown that different types of media programming may evoke prosocial behaviors in children. The channels aimed at younger viewers like Nickelodeon and Disney Channel had significantly more acts of altruism than the general-audience demographic channels like A&E; and or TNT, according to one large-scale study. This study examined the programming of 18 different channels, including more than 2,000 entertainment shows, during a randomly selected week on television. The study revealed that nearly three quarters (73 percent) of programs contained at least one act of altruism and on average viewers saw around three acts of altruism an hour. Around one-third of those behaviors were explicitly rewarded in the plot, potentially sending the message that these acts of prosocial behavior can come with positive consequences. Another study on the topic was conducted by University at Buffalo, Iowa State University and University of Minnesota professors. They studied children for two years for the purpose of investigating the role of media exposure on prosocial behavior for young boys and girls. The study concluded that media exposure could possibly predict outcomes related to prosocial behavior. Other experimental research has suggested that prosocial video games may increase prosocial behavior in players although some of this work has proven difficult to replicate. However other scholars have been critical of this work for tending to falsely dichotomize video games into prosocial/violent categories despite significant overlap as well as methodological flaws in the experimental studies . For instance a study by Ferguson and Garza found that exposure to violent video games was associated with increased prosocial behavior, both on-line as well as volunteering in the real world. The authors speculated this may be due to the prosocial themes common in many violent games, as well as team oriented play in many games.  Legislation  In the United States, in an effort to get stations to air education and prosocial programming for children, the Children's Television Act was adopted in 1990. It states that channels must produce and air programming developed specifically for children as a condition to renew broadcast licenses. After discussions as to what the definition of \\"specifically designed for children\\" really means, in 1996 guidelines were passed to correct this ambiguity.Strabhaar, Joseph. LaRose, Robert. Davenport, Lucinda. \\"Media Now.\\" Enhanced 6th ed. Chapter 13, p. 427. Influence of observation People are generally much more likely to act pro-socially in a public setting rather than in a private setting. One explanation for this finding has to do with perceived status, being publicly recognized as a pro- social individual often enhance one's self-image and desirability to be considered for inclusion in social groups. Other research has shown that merely given people the \\"illusion\\" that they are being observed (e.g., by hanging up posters of \\"staring\\" human eyes) can generate significant changes in pro-social acts such as charitable giving and less littering. Pictures of human eyes trigger an involuntary neural gaze detection mechanism, which primes people to act pro-socially.manish dahiya,(December,2019).A sample of the self learning course on Advance Personality Development, for individuals who are striving to better their life and unleash their true potential.https://advancepersonalitydevelopment.blogspot.com// There are two different forms of prosocial behaviors. Ordinary prosocial behavior requires, \\"situational and sociocultural demands.\\" Extraordinary prosocial behavior doesn't include as much. This indicates that one form is used for a more selfish result while the other is not. Influence of perception of responsibility and guilt Guilt has long been regarded as a motivator for prosocial behavior. Extensive data from a 2012 study conducted by de Hooge, demonstrates that when a secondary individual repairs a transgressors’ damage caused to victims, the transgressors’ guilt feelings, reparative intentions, and prosocial behavior drastically diminish. Thus, reduction of guilt may have more to do with reparative actions broadly, rather than necessarily prosocial behaviors taken on by oneself. Social media in natural disasters Social media can also be a catalyst for prosocial behavior. One example occurred during the relief efforts in the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan, when users turned to Facebook and Twitter to provide financial and emotional support via their social networks. Direct donations to Japanese relief were possible on The Red Cross fan page on Facebook,Gale, Cheryl Social Media Influence in Japanese Relief. business2community.com. March 16, 2011 and via online discount sites like Groupon and LivingSocial. Relation to mood and emotion Mood and prosocial behavior are closely linked. People often experience the \\"feel good-do good\\" phenomena, where being in a good mood increases helping behaviors. Being in a good mood helps us to see the \\"good\\" in other people, and prolongs our own good mood. For example, mood and work behaviors have frequently been examined in research; studies show that positive mood at work is associated with more positive work-related behaviors (e.g., helping co-workers). Similarly, prosocial behaviors increase positive mood. Several studies have shown the benefits of volunteering and other prosocial behaviors on self-esteem, life satisfaction, and overall mental health. Additionally, negative mood can also impact prosocial behavior. Research has shown that guilt often leads to prosocial behaviors, whereas other negative mood states, such as fear, do not lead to the same prosocial behaviors.Roos, S., Hodges, E.V.E., & Salmivalli, C. (2013). Do Guilt- and Shame-Proneness Differentially Predict Prosocial, Aggressive, and Withdrawn Behaviors During Adolescence? Developmental Psychology A recent pilot study examined whether an intervention increasing prosocial behavior (kind acts) in young adults with social anxiety would both increase positive affect and decrease social anxiety in participants. Participants randomly assigned to a 4-week Kind Acts intervention, where individuals were instructed to engage in three kind acts each day twice a week over the 4 week period, showed both higher self-reported positive mood and increased satisfaction with relationships at the end of the intervention. This intervention demonstrates ways in which prosocial behavior may be beneficial in improving mood and mental health. Other research suggests that cultivating positive emotions, such as gratitude, may also facilitate prosocial behavior. A study by Bartlett & DeSteno examined the ability of gratitude to shape costly prosocial behavior, demonstrating that gratitude increases efforts to assist a benefactor even when such efforts are costly (i.e., hedonically negative), and that this increase is qualitatively different from efforts given from just general positive affective state. They also show that gratitude can increase assistance provided to strangers, not just close social ties. Awe is another positive emotional state that has been closely linked to inspiring generosity and prosocial behavior. Piff et al. studied this phenomenon through experiments using economic and ethical-decision making games and explain, \\"When people experience awe they really want to share that experience with other people, suggesting that it has this particularly viral component to it... awe binds people together—by causing people to want to share their positive experiences collectively with one another.\\" Psychopathy and lack of prosocial behavior In 1941, Hervey CleckleyCleckley, H. (1941). The mask of sanity; an attempt to reinterpret the so-called psychopathic personality.Cleckley, H. (1976). The mask of sanity 5th ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby. described psychopathy as a disorder in which individuals often initially appear intelligent, charming, and even kind but are in fact egocentric, grandiose and impulsive. He described individuals who would, on a whim, leave their families to cross the country gambling, drinking and fighting, only to return and act as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Today, psychopathy is described as a personality disorder that is characterized by decreased anxiety, fear, and social closeness as well as increased impulsivity, manipulativeness, interpersonal dominance and aggression. These traits lead to numerous types of antisocial behavior including high rates of substance abuse, serial short term relationships, and various forms of criminal behavior. One common misconception about psychopathy though is that all psychopaths are serial killers or other vicious criminals. In reality, many researchers do not consider criminal behavior to be a criterion for the disorder although the role of criminality in the disorder is strongly debated. Additionally, psychopathy is being researched as a dimensional construct that is one extreme of normal range personality traits instead of a categorical disorder. In regards to the lack of prosocial behavior in psychopathy, there are several theories that have been proposed in the literature. One theory suggests that psychopaths engage in less prosocial behavior (and conversely more antisocial behavior) because of a deficit in their ability to recognize fear in others, particularly fearful facial expressions. Because they are unable to recognize that their actions are causing another distress, they continue that behavior in order to obtain some goal that benefits them. A second theory proposes that psychopaths have a sense of \\"altruistic punishment\\" where they are willing to punish other individuals even if it means they will be harmed in some way. There has also been an evolutionary theory proposed stating that psychopaths lack of prosocial behavior is an adaptive mating strategy in that it allows them to spread more of their genes while taking less responsibility for their offspring. Finally, there is some evidence that in some situations psychopaths behavior may not be antisocial but instead it may be more utilitarian than other individuals. In a recent study, Bartels & Pizarro (2011) found that when making decisions about traditional moral dilemmas such as the trolley problem, individuals high in psychopathic traits actually make more utilitarian (and therefore more moral in some views) choices. This finding is particularly interesting because it suggests that psychopaths, who are often considered immoral or even evil, may actually make better moral decisions than non-psychopaths. The authors of this study conclude that individuals high in psychopathic traits are less influenced by their emotions and therefore make more \\"mathematical\\" decisions and choose the option that leads to the lowest number of deaths. The theories discussed above are not intended to be a comprehensive list but instead to provide a sense of how psychopaths differ in their approach to social interactions. As with most psychological/social phenomena, it is likely a combination of these factors that leads to psychopaths' lack of prosocial behavior. Further research is needed to determine the causal nature of any one of these individual deficits as well as if there is any way to help these individuals develop more prosocial patterns of behavior. Helper's high Psychologists have shown that helping others can produce \\"feel-good\\" neurotransmitters such as oxytocin and that, similar to any other pleasurable activity, the act of volunteering, giving and behaving pro-socially can become addictive. Some work has been done on utilizing this principle through the concept of helper therapy, in which therapeutic benefits are gleaned from assisting others. Community health workers have been found to gain helper benefits that include positive feelings about self, a sense of belonging, valuable work experience, and access to health information and skills through their prosocial vocation, which may buffer against the various stressors inherent in this line of work. In addition, Helper therapy may also be highly beneficial for distressed adolescents experiencing suicidal thoughts. Studies indicate that when help-seeking youth use online community forums, the help- seekers often begin to provide support for other help seekers, and develop a reciprocal prosocial community battling depression together. Prosocial dissidence Stefano Passini and Davide Morselli argue that groups will obey authority so long as its system, basis, and demands are viewed as legitimate. Passini and Morselli distinguish between anti-social disobedience, which they see as destructive, and prosocial disobedience, which they see as constructive. \\"Disobedience becomes prosocial when it is enacted for the sake of the whole society, including all its different levels and groups. In contrast, anti-social disobedience is enacted mainly in favour of one's own group, in order to attain individual rights.\\" A main difference between anti- social and pro-social dissidence is the way that they relate to authority; anti-social dissidents reject authority and disobey its norms and laws, while pro-social dissidents understand the important roles that societal laws play in maintaining order, but also recognize and address the flaws in authoritative reasoning. Pro-social protests, if viewed in a positive manner, can increase freedoms and equality for the general public, and improve democratic institutions.

Built in 1838, it is a good local example of Greek Revival architecture, further notable as the home of historian Jared Sparks. Now owned by Harvard University, it was moved to its present location in 1968, and is used for professor housing. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description The Treadwell-Sparks House stands on the north side of Kirkland Street, opposite Harvard's Memorial Hall. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and brick chimneys. It is oriented with a sidewall facing the street, and its main facade to the east. The street-facing facad is characterized by unusually wide plain pilasters and flushboarding, while the formal front is finished in wooden clapboards. It is roughly square in plan, with three bays on each side. History The house was built, originally on nearby Quincy Street, in 1838 by housewright William Saunders for Harvard Professor Daniel Treadwell. The house was purchased in 1848 by Nathaniel Silsbee for his daughter, who was married to historian Jared Sparks. The house was purchased from Sparks' heirs by the New Church Theological School and served as the New England training center for Swedenborgian ministers. In 1901 Langford Warren, architect and member of the General Convention of the New Jerusalem (Swedenborgian), designed and oversaw the construction of a chapel, rotating the house and moving it a short distance on its lot. In the 1960s, the building was sold back to Harvard and the New Church Theological School moved to Newton.From Harvard's Graduate School of Design report on the Church of the New Jerusalem (the chapel built in 1901 for the school) The structure was moved in 1968 about from its original site at 48 Quincy Street to its current location at 21 Kirkland Street in order to make room for the construction of Gund Hall.Bunting, Bainbridge (edited by Margaret Henderson Floyd). Harvard: An Architectural History. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998: 240. The move included moving the property's carriage house, and carefully preserved its original orientation to the street. The house now serves as the private residence of Harvard University's Plummer Professor of Christian Morals.

The Qubaysi group is for women only and is an active part of Syria's Islamic revivalist movement. The group calls for an apolitical Islam.Line Khatib, Islamic Revival in Syria, The rise and fall of Ba'this secularism. It aims at teaching Syrian young women and girls the Quran, al-Hadith (الحديث النبوي), Tafsir and Islamic values and traditions. It organizes religious lessons in homes and has been instrumental in spreading religious sentiment among young women. Since its early days, the movement has operated semi-openly until it was recognized by Syrian state under Bashar al- Asad government in 2003 and was allowed to openly operate its activities from official mosques.Line Khatib, Islamic Revival in Syria, The rise and fall of Ba'this secularism History The activities of the Qubaysiat women started in the early 1960. Munira al-Qubaysi منيرة القبيسي the founder of group, is a certified school teacher in natural sciences.http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2006/05/03/23408.html After graduation she was appointed as a teacher in various schools in Damascus. Her position as a school teacher enabled her to combine her education work with Islamic preaching. These preaching activities were the reason for her imprisonment a couple of time during the early 1960s.Line Khatib, Islamic Revival in Syria, The rise and fall of Ba'this secularism After Hama massacre of 1982 the group was forced to clandestinely carry out its preaching activities until 2003.http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2006/05/03/23408.html The group has greatly benefited from the change in the Syrian government's policies towards Islamic revival in the Syrian society. First, Bashar al-Assad removed the law that forbids girls to wear hijab at public schools, then he recognized al-Qubaysiat and called them to openly carry out their activities in public mosques.http://www.aina.org/news/20060903125633.pdf Ideology There is controversy surrounding the ideology of the group. Some claim that the group is influenced by the Sufi ideology of the Kuftariya Naqshbandiya order. The basis for this assumption is the fact that Munira al-Qubaysi herself was a discipline of Sheykh Ahmad Kuftaro.القبيسيات التنظيم النسائي الصوفي http://www.saaid.net/feraq/sufyah/t/11.htm Also, the nature of the group's work has a Sufi characteristic; it calls for elevating religious and moral consciousness of society by stimulating individual's ethical habits and behavior. The other assumption is that al-Qubaysiat ideology is influenced by Baathism since some members of their groups are sisters and daughters of the Baath Party.http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2013/04/25/rise-of-syrian- sisterhood/g187 This assumption is rather strong since the Group assumed Baathi posts after the 2011 Revolution. Organization Like all Sufi orders, the group has a hierarchical organization. Women are distributed among various ranks within the organization. A rank of a member of the group is known by the color of her Hijab. Members of the group are often identified by their distinctive style of dress, a hijab tied with a large knot under the chin, buttoned overcoats coming down the mid-shin level. White hijab is worn by newly recruited members or members with a low degree of commitment to the group's activities. Light blue hijab is worn by members who have been upgraded and are in the middle rank. Besides working of recruiting new girls to the group, members of this rank are entitled with organizational and educational tasks. Organizational tasks range between organizing events and arranging meeting places. Educational tasks are mainly about reciting the Quran and the Sunna with young members of the group. Dark blue hijab is given for active and senior members; these members are entrusted with the task of teaching and preaching more sophisticated texts such as Fiqh, Shareea laws.

Description and history Salem and Auburn Streets are two short residential streets located near the center of Cambridge's Cambridgeport neighborhood, which is bounded by River Street, Massachusetts Avenue, the Charles River, and the Grand Junction Railroad tracks. Auburn Street runs northwest to southeast across the neighborhood, paralleling Massachusetts Avenue. On the block of Auburn between Pearl Street and Brookline Street, Salem Street is a one-block street extending southwest to Watson Street. The district includes most of the properties on these two blocks. At the beginning of the 19th century Cambridgeport was a relatively small village, with narrow streets. The area did not see significant organized development until the mid-19th century. The houses along Salem Street and this single block of Auburn Street were all built between about 1800 and 1845, before this later development took place, and are the largest cluster of houses from that period that survive. The ten historically significant houses are typically vernacular versions of Late Georgian, Federal period, and Greek Revival architecture.

Headquartered in Munich, Germany, Wacker Neuson SE is the parent company of the Wacker Neuson Group, a global organization that develops, produces and distributes concrete technology, compaction equipment, worksite technology and compact construction equipment, also offering a range of complementary services. Founded in 1848, the family- owned company now has more than 50 affiliates, over 140 sales and service stations and over 12,000 sales and service partners worldwide (2017). The Group currently has 5,064 employees. Wacker Neuson SE has been listed on the SDAX since 2007. History Early years through to 1945 The company was founded in 1848 by Johann Christian Wacker as a blacksmith’s shop in Dresden (Germany) trading as Wacker. It started industrial production in 1875. In 1930, the company’s engineers developed a high-frequency technology for internal vibrators. At the same time, the first electrically powered rammer – an innovation in concrete and soil compaction – was developed and produced. Before the start of World War II, the company had already expanded its product portfolio and created a domestic and international sales and retail organization. Progress was halted by the destruction of the production facility in Dresden just before the end of the war. Post-war period through to 2007 Business operations were resumed in Kulmbach in 1945, and the company moved its headquarters to Munich in 1951. The first foreign affiliate was established in 1957 in Hartford (Wisconsin, USA). In 1986, Hartford operations relocated to Menomonee Falls, now home to a production facility and logistics centre. Subsequently, the company stepped up its international presence, and now has 50 affiliates, over 140 sales and service outlets and over 12,000 sales and service partners worldwide (2017). The group changed structure from a limited company (GmbH) to a public limited company, Wacker Construction Equipment AG, in 2002. Until 2005, Wacker only developed, produced and distributed light construction equipment up to approx. three tonnes in the concrete technology, soil & asphalt compaction, demolition and utility segments. Following the acquisition of Weidemann GmbH in 2005, the company branched out into compact construction equipment and the agricultural sector. Drillfix AG (Switzerland) and Ground Heaters, Inc. (USA) were purchased in 2006. 2007 to date The company was floated on 15 May 2007, and is listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It was admitted to the SDAX in autumn 2007. On October 31, 2007, the company merged with Neuson Kramer Baumaschinen AG (Linz, Austria), a manufacturer of compact construction equipment including compact excavators, wheel loaders, dumpers and skid steer loaders. Neuson Kramer Baumaschinen AG itself was the product of a merger between Neuson Baumaschinen GmbH and the long-established company Kramer-Werke GmbH. Neuson was established in 1981 as Neuson Hydraulik GmbH, based in Linz, and initially developed hydraulic mini-excavators. Neuson Baumaschinen GmbH was established in 1990. Dumper manufacturer Lifton Ltd. (GB) was acquired in 1998, and skid-steer loaders were added to the product range in 2004. Neuson and Kramer merged in 2001. In February 2009, Wacker Construction Equipment AG underwent a change of legal form and assumed its current name of Wacker Neuson SE. Group overview Brands Wacker Neuson SE organises its activities by region (Europe, America and Asia- Pacific). The group is divided into three business fields: Light Equipment, Compact Equipment (weighing up to approximately 14 tons), and Services (spare parts, maintenance and repair). The Compact Equipment segment supplies excavators, wheel loaders, telescopic handlers, skid-steer loaders and dumpers. These machines are used in application areas including structural and civil engineering, road construction, agriculture, gardening, landscaping, municipal works, recycling and industrial projects.

He served as President of the Academy of the Arts in Berlin between 1968 and 1974. Biography Early life Born to journalist and theater director Julius Hirsch and his wife Camilla, David Hirsch was the half-brother of Heinrich Theodor Hirsch. He left the Archduke Rainer Gymnasium in Vienna at the age of 17 to pursue an acting career. Heinz was exempted from military service due to a lung illness. He moved to Germany, working in theaters in Friedrichroda and Eisenach during 1917. Although he never attended an acting studio, he was also given roles in theaters in Berlin, Hamburg and other cities. In November 1918, he joined the cast of the Deutsches Theater. He had his debut on screen in the 1919 film Die Geächteten; another of his early roles in cinema was that of the first mate on the Empusa in Nosferatu. He married during 1921, but his wife suffered from Pleurisy and died after six months.Renate Waack, Wolfgang Heinz. Wolfgang Heinz: Denken, Handeln, Kämpfen. Henschel (1980). ASIN B0027D7704. Pages 13-15. Heinz later acted in the Schauspielhaus Berlin, which he left at 1923, when voice problems forced him to abandon his career for three years. In 1926, Max Reinhardt accepted him to the cast of the Deutsches Theater again, where he also started to direct plays. Heinz was a close friend of actor Hans Otto, and under his influence became a member of the Communist Party of Germany at 1930.Wolfgang Heinz. defa.de. Exile Along with all the Jewish and leftist actors, Heinz was dismissed from his work on 27 February 1933. He left for the Netherlands, from where he moved to Great Britain, and on to Vienna. He finally settled in Switzerland, in which - with many other exiles from Germany - he acted in the Schauspielhaus Zürich. At 1938, he began to direct plays in the theater. During his time in Switzerland, Heinz was one of the founders and the president of the Swiss Free Austrian Movement. He rescinded his membership in the KPD at 1943.Helmut Müller-Enbergs.

After the end of World War II, Heinz emigrated to the Soviet- occupied part of Vienna; at 1946, he joined the Communist Party of Austria. At first, he was part of the ensemble of the People's Theater. In 1948, with Karl Paryla and Emil Stöhr, he was a founding member, from 1948 to 1956, of the \\"Neue Theater in der Scala\\", a \\"workers' theatre\\". The theater held a communist and a pro-Soviet line, and openly defied the ban on Bertolt Brecht's works imposed in Vienna. Heinz met his second wife, Austrian actress Erika Pelikowsky, while working in the Scala. He was also active as a director in the Deutsches Theater since 1951. In 1956, after the Soviet withdrawal from Austria, the theater was closed. Heinz, Pelikowsky and their daughter Gabriele (born 1948) moved to East Berlin.Wolfgang Heinz. film-zeit.de.

Beside this, he also directed 80 plays through the years and appeared in several DEFA films. From 1959 to 1962, he headed the National Theatre School in Berlin. In 1960, he became a professor and a member of the Academy of the Arts. In 1963, he left the KPÖ and joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. At the same year, he replaced Langhoff as the theater's director and manager, holding this position until 1969.Heinrich Gebauer. Vom Autodidakten zum Charakterdarsteller.

The game tells of a future where many people suffer from a pandemic depression known as The Dolor. In an unnamed city, specialized doctors known as Mnemonicides treat patients who suffer from The Dolor. The game's protagonist, a young Mnemonicide named Blackiris, is given the task of curing a young girl named La of The Dolor. The game was translated to English and released in February 2008 by Insani. A remake titled was released on Nintendo 3DS's eShop on February 22, 2012. Gameplay Like most visual novels, the gameplay consists entirely of reading text and clicking the left mouse button to advance the text. The text is accompanied by a still background, sprites of the characters in the foreground, whose expressions change during conversations but are not animated in any other way, music and sound. At certain points in the game, an event CG, an image of the current situation, is shown instead of a static background with character images in front of it. True Remembrance also features an auto mode, which advances the text automatically so the player does not need to click, and a skip mode, which quickly skips through all text until either the player interrupts by clicking, or the game encounters text which has not yet been read by the player. Unlike some visual novels, True Remembrance does not feature any decision points, where the player must choose between different options that may alter the story depending on the option chosen. Another feature that is common in visual novels but absent in True Remembrance is voice acting: none of the dialogue in the game is accompanied by the character's voice. True Remembrance is also one of the rare free visual novels to have an animated opening movie, accompanied by a vocal song. Story The story begins with an introduction of its setting: a dystopian scenario set on a modern-day timeline where severe depression has become a worldwide pandemic and is given a proper medical term - The Dolor. The only way to combat this disease that has taken the grip of humanity is the complete erasure of the memories that has triggered depression on patients. Mnemonicides, doctors with inborn telepathic powers capable of memory alteration and are specially trained for the task, are individually and periodically assigned with patients, termed as Guests, to cure the latter's condition. The series of treatments takes place in a town specifically designed for Mnemonicides and Guests to live together for the length of the entire medication. Blackiris is introduced as a top notch Alpha-class Mnemonicide, who takes on a Guest named La. The ensuing storyline unravels the daily strides that they take together and the mysterious connection that they share. Characters Blackiris (黒目 Kurome) - A young Class Alpha Mnemonicide working in the City. The game begins with him on his way to meet up with his new client, a girl named La. He is considered something of a prodigy, having graduated from his class at the Academy in only two years (the norm being anywhere from four to eight years). His powers are generally unrivaled within the City. He had a calm demeanor and is rarely fazed by anything. La (ラ Ra) - A 17-year-old girl who comes to the City burdened with memories and secrets. She is Blackiris' client, and the two live together. She is sweet and loving, but not everyone realizes it, as her curt way of speaking causes her to come off as cold. Even though she is Blackiris' client, she never actually speaks to him about getting cured. Rook (キョウ Kyou) - A brash young man who works at a small café called \\"Aroma\\" within the City limits and is also a Mnemonicide. He tends to be very full of himself, claiming his place is the best out there. However, in truth, he is an extremely talented chef, though he rarely gets any customers. He is easy-going and an avid fan of games. He is one of the few people Blackiris trusts. Marcello (マール Maaru) - A young, spoiled rich boy who wants his memories erased. His family put forth a large amount of money to receive treatment from a Class Alpha Mnemonicide; Rook convinces Blackiris to take the job, but Blackiris tricks Marcello into revealing his true feelings about his memories. Irina (イーリャ Iirya) - A young woman who sneaks into the city seeking treatment from a Mnemonicide. She is getting married and wants to have her memories of her family erased. Blackiris is initially unwilling to treat her, but eventually relents due to La's pleading. Irina is a talented cook, and repays Blackiris by cooking a meal before leaving the city. Analye - The legendary \\"Alpha of Omegas\\" ― one of the few Class Omega Mnemonicides in the world. Every Mnemonicide knows his name ― but few have actually met him. Most of the textbooks in the Academy's library were written by him, or under his supervision. Dexter - Blackiris' direct superior, and the superintendent for many of the Mnemonicides in the City. Little else is known about this secretive figure. Lips - A young lady Mnemonicide currently on service in the City.

September 9, 1945) is an American author on lesbian themes, specially noted for authentic characterizing of butch and femme characters in fiction. She is the recipient of a Golden Crown Literary Society Trail Blazer award for lifetime achievement, as well as being the namesake for the Golden Crown Literary Society's Lee Lynch Classics Award. Personal Life  Lynch was born in Manhattan, NY on September 9, 1945. Throughout school, she was bullied for being different. She began to realize her lesbian sexuality around age 15. Lynch says that her protest against societal norms were individual acts, such as kissing her girlfriend in public, or dressing in men's clothing as much as possible. At the time, acts such as these meant she was basically considered a juvenile delinquent by New York law. In the 1960s, Lynch subscribed to The Ladder, the first nationally distributed lesbian publication in the United States. In the 1980s, Lynch was in a relationship with another lesbian artist, Tee Corinne. In 2009, Lynch moved from the Oregon Coast to Florida where she earned a living as a researcher. She has since retired and returned to Oregon in 2013, enabling her to work full-time on writing pursuits. In 2010, she married Elaine Mulligan Lynch in Provincetown. She now lives with her wife in the Pacific Northwest.  Career  Lynch published her first piece of writing in The Ladder in 1963. From there, she became a frequent contributor, as it was the only lesbian publication at the time.Gallo, Marcia. Different Daughters: A history of the Daughters of Bilitis and the Birth of the Lesbian Rights Movement, Carroll & Graf, 2006. In 1983, Lynch published her first novel, Toothpick House, with Naiad Press. She went on to publish 10 more novels with Naiad, between the years 1984-1994. She has also published essays, and her stories have appeared in a number of anthologies. She has written reviews and feature articles for The Lambda Book Report and many other publications. Lynch's syndicated column, \\"The Amazon Trail\\", has been running in papers across the country since 1986. Beginning in 2006, Lynch published 9 more lesbian novels with Bold Strokes Books, a New York queer publishing house. Lynch cites Isabel Miller, Willa Cather, and Jane Rule as some of her writing inspirations. Many younger lesbian writers such as Karin Kallmaker and Rachel Spangler have cited her influence, especially regarding the importance of authenticity in lesbian literature. Her adept way of characterizing butch and femme characters in her writing set the standard for many novelists writing since the 1970s. Lynch stated that her birth family has never read her work.  Awards and honors  In 2006, Lynch was inducted into the Saints and Sinners Literary Festival's Hall of Fame in New Orleans. Lynch's novel Sweet Creek was a finalist for a Golden Crown Literary Society Award and was named one of the top ten fiction books of the year by the Q Syndicate. In 2009 Lynch was awarded the Golden Crown Literary Society Trail Blazer award for lifetime achievement, in recognition of the contributions she has made to the field of lesbian literature. In addition, her novel Beggar of Love won the 2010 Ann Bannon Popular Choice Award. Amusingly enough, she also won the James Duggins Mid-Career Prize in 2010, after more than forty-five years of writing.

Although the coup d'état began on New Year's Eve and finished in the early hours of New Year's Day, scholarly sources like and have referred to the coup as the \\"Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état\\" or \\"Coup d'état of Saint-Sylvestre\\". was a coup d'état staged by Jean-Bédel Bokassa, leader of the Central African Republic (CAR) army, and his military officers against the government of President David Dacko on 31 December 1965 and 1 January 1966. Dacko, Bokassa's cousin, took over the country in 1960, and Bokassa, a military officer in the French army, joined the CAR army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, but despite this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa made plans to take over the government; Dacko was made aware of this, and attempted to counter by forming the gendarmerie headed by Jean Izamo, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser. With the aid of Captain Alexandre Banza, Bokassa started the coup New Year's Eve night in 1965. First, Bokassa and his men captured Jean Izamo, locking him in a cellar at Camp de Roux. Bokassa's men then occupied the capital, Bangui, and overpowered the gendarmerie and other resistance. After midnight, Dacko headed back to the capital, where he was promptly arrested, forced to resign from office and then imprisoned at Camp Kassaï. According to official reports, eight people were killed for resisting the coup. By the end of January 1966, Izamo was tortured to death, but Dacko's life was spared because of a request from the French government, which Bokassa was trying to satisfy. Bokassa justified the coup by claiming he had to save the country from falling under the influence of communism, and cut off diplomatic relations with China. In the early days of his government, Bokassa dissolved the National Assembly, abolished the Constitution and issued a number of decrees, banning begging, female circumcision, and polygamy, among other things. Bokassa initially struggled to obtain international recognition for the new government. However, after a successful meeting with the president of Chad, Bokassa obtained recognition of the regime from other African nations, and eventually from France, the former colonial power. Bokassa's right-hand man Banza attempted his own coup in April 1969, but one of his co-conspirators informed the president of the plan. Banza was put in front of a military tribunal and sentenced to death by firing squad. Dacko, who remained in isolation at Camp de Roux, sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador in Brazzaville in June 1969, which Bokassa intercepted. Bokassa charged Dacko with threatening state security and transferred him to the infamous Ngaragba Prison, where many prisoners taken captive during the coup were still being held. A local judge convinced Bokassa that there was a lack of evidence to convict Dacko, who was instead placed under house arrest. In September 1976, Dacko was named personal adviser to the president; the French government later convinced him to take part in a coup to overthrow Bokassa, who was under heavy criticism for his ruthless dictatorial rule. This coup was carried out on 20 and 21 September 1979, when Dacko became president again, only to be overthrown in another coup two years later. Background President David Dacko In 1958, after the French Fourth Republic began to consider granting independence to most of its African colonies, nationalist leader Barthélemy Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui- Chari, a French colonial territory which later became the Central African Republic (CAR).. De Gaulle accepted his request, and on 1 December 1958, Boganda declared the establishment of the autonomous CAR, with full independence to follow soon.. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. However, he was killed in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to the capital, Bangui.. Boganda's right-hand man Abel Goumba, described as \\"intelligent, honest, and strongly nationalistic\\". by author Brian Titley in Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa, succeeded him as the leader of the CAR.. In May 1959, a month into Goumba's term, David Dacko took control of the government. Dacko, a former member of Boganda's cabinet and party leader of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), had the support of the French high commissioner Roger Barberot, the Bangui chamber of commerce and Boganda's widow Michelle Jourdain.. Two months later, Dacko dismissed Goumba from his new post as minister of finance. Goumba and Pierre Maleombho, the former president of the National Assembly who was ousted by Dacko, left the MESAN party and organized their own opposition party, Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa (MEDAC), on 25 June 1960.. Meanwhile, on August 13, 1960, Boganda's dream was realized when the Central African Republic (CAR) attained formal independence from France.. MEDAC became moderately popular, was approved by Etienne Ngounio (the Dacko-appointed president of MESAN),. and received significant support in by-elections on 20 September.. Dacko viewed MEDAC as a dissident party and sought to disestablish it--he soon received power from the National Assembly to deal with his opponents in any way he saw fit. In December 1960, Dacko dissolved MEDAC and Goumba was arrested for \\"fomenting disorder by questioning Dacko's assumption of power\\". Goumba was eventually given a moderate sentence and subsequently permitted to move to France to complete his education.. On 1 January 1962, Dacko's cousin, Jean-Bédel Bokassa, left the French Army and joined the military forces of the CAR with the rank of battalion commandant.. Over a year later, Bokassa became commander-in-chief of the 500 soldiers in the Central African army. Due to his relation to Dacko and experience abroad in the French military, Bokassa was able to quickly rise through the ranks of the army, becoming the Central African army's first colonel on 1 December 1964.. Bokassa sought recognition for his status as the army's leader; he frequently appeared in public wearing all his military decorations, and in ceremonies often tried to sit next to President Dacko to hint at his importance in the government.. Bokassa constantly involved himself in heated arguments with Jean-Paul Douate, the government's chief of protocol, who admonished him for not following the correct order of seating at presidential tables. At first, Dacko found his cousin's antics for power and recognition amusing. Despite the recent rash of African military coups, Dacko publicly dismissed the possibility that Bokassa would someday try to take control of the country. At a state dinner, he said, \\"Colonel Bokassa only wants to collect medals and he is too stupid to pull off a coup d'état\\".. Other members of Dacko's cabinet saw Bokassa as a major threat to the regime. Jean-Arthur Bandio, the minister of interior, recommended that Bokassa be brought into the cabinet, which he hoped would both satisfy the colonel's desire for recognition and break his connections with the army. To prevent the possibility of a military coup, Dacko created the gendarmerie, an armed police force of 500, headed by Jean Izamo, and a 120-member presidential security guard, led by Prosper Mounoumbaye. Origins Dacko's government faced a number of problems during 1964 and 1965: the economy experienced stagnation, the bureaucracy started to fall apart, and the country's boundaries were constantly breached by Lumumbists from the south and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army from the east.. Under pressure from radicals in MESAN and in an attempt to cultivate alternative sources of support and display his independence in foreign policy, Dacko established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in September 1964. A delegation led by Meng Yieng and agents of the Chinese government toured the country, showing Communist propaganda films. Soon after, the PRC gave the CAR an interest-free loan of one billion CFA francs (20 million French francs.); however, the aid failed to prevent the prospect of a financial collapse for the country. Another problem which plagued the government was widespread corruption.. Bokassa felt that he needed to take over the CAR government to remove the influence of Communism and solve all the country's problems. According to Samuel Decalo, a scholar on African government, Bokassa's personal ambitions most likely played the most important role in his decision to launch a coup against the government.. Dacko sent Bokassa to Paris as part of a delegation for the Bastille Day celebrations in July 1965. After attending a 23 July ceremony to mark the closing of a military officer training school he had attended decades earlier, Bokassa planned to return to the CAR. However, Dacko had forbidden his return, and Bokassa spent the next few months trying to obtain the support of friends in the French and Central African armed forces. Dacko eventually yielded to pressure and allowed Bokassa back in October.Bokassa claimed that Dacko finally gave up after French President Charles de Gaulle personally intervened, telling Dacko that \\"Bokassa must be immediately returned to his post. I cannot tolerate the mistreatment of my companion-in-arms\\". . Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa increased. In December, Dacko approved a budget increase for Izamo's gendarmerie, but rejected the budget proposal for Bokassa's army.. At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko's treatment and was \\"going for a coup d'état\\". Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, and wanted to promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates. Dacko was not silent about his plans; he hinted at his intentions to elders of the Bobangui village, who informed Bokassa of the plan in turn. Bokassa realized he had to act against Dacko quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be no match for the gendarmerie and the presidential guard. He was also concerned the French would intervene to aid Dacko, as had occurred after the 23 February 1964 coup d'état in Gabon against President Léon M'ba. After receiving word of the coup from the country's vice president, officials in Paris sent paratroopers to Gabon in a matter of hours and M'ba was quickly restored to power. Bokassa found substantive support from his co-conspirator, Captain Alexandre Banza, who was commander of the Camp Kassaï military base in northeast Bangui, and, like Bokassa, had served in the French army in posts around the world. Banza was an intelligent, ambitious and capable man who played a major role in planning the coup. By late December, rumours of coup plots were circulating among officials in the capital. Dacko's personal advisers alerted him that Bokassa \\"showed signs of mental instability\\" and needed to be arrested before he sought to bring down the government, but Dacko did not act upon such advice.. Coup d'état on 31 December and 1 January Map of the Central African Republic Early in the evening of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his ministers' plantations southwest of the capital. At 22:30, Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup: one of his captains was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was to take control of Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers.. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a New Year's Eve celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. When asked if he would support the coup, Izamo said no, leading Bokassa and Banza to overpower him and hold him in a cellar. Shortly after midnight on 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza organized their troops and told them of their plan to take over the government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had resigned from the presidency and given the position to his close advisor Izamo, then told the soldiers that the gendarmerie would take over the CAR army, which had to act now to keep its position. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were locked up. At 00:30, Bokassa and his supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was nowhere to be found. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found. Dacko was not aware of the events taking place in the capital. After leaving his minister's plantation near midnight, he headed to Simon Samba's house to ask the Aka Pygmy leader to conduct a year-end ritual. After an hour at Samba's house, he was informed of the coup in Bangui. According to Titley, Dacko then left for the capital, in hopes of stopping the coup with the help of loyal members of the gendarmerie and French paratroopers.. Others like Thomas E. O'Toole, professor of sociology and anthropology at St. Cloud State University, believe that Dacko was not trying to mount a resistance, instead he was planning on resigning and handing his power over to Izamo.. In any case, Dacko was arrested by soldiers patrolling Pétévo Junction, on the western border of the capital. He was taken back to the presidential palace, where Bokassa hugged the president and told him, \\"I tried to warn you—but now it's too late\\". President Dacko was taken to Ngaragba Prison in east Bangui at around 02:00. In a move that he thought would boost his popularity in the country, Bokassa ordered prison director Otto Sacher to release all prisoners in the jail. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp Kassaï at 03:20, where the president was forced to resign from office. Later, Bokassa's officers announced on Radio-Bangui that the Dacko government had been toppled and Bokassa had taken over control. In the morning, Bokassa addressed the public via Radio-Bangui: Aftermath Officially, eight people died trying to resist the coup.. Afterwards, Bokassa's officers went around the country, arresting Dacko's political allies and close friends, including Simon Samba, Jean-Paul Douate and more than 60 presidential security guards, who were all taken to Ngaragba Prison. Prosper Mounoumbaye, the director of the presidential security, fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Weeks later, he was detained by the Congolese authorities and handed over to Bokassa on 23 January 1966. At Camp Kassaï, he was beaten and tortured to death, in full view of Bokassa, Banza and Dacko. Jean Izamo met a similar fate: he was transferred to Ngaragba Prison on 10 January, but was tortured to death by the month's end. President Dacko's life was spared, as Bokassa wanted international recognition for his government and France had threatened to cut off aid to the CAR if Dacko was killed. Bokassa had Dacko detained in a small room at Camp Kassaï, where he was cut off from communication with the outside world and placed on a highly restrictive diet. On 3 February, he was taken to Camp de Roux, where he remained in isolation. In the meantime, Bokassa engaged in self-promotion before the media, showing his countrymen his French army medals, and displaying his strength, fearlessness and masculinity. He formed a new government called the Revolutionary Council, invalidated the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly, calling it \\"a lifeless organ no longer representing the people\\".. In his address to the nation, Bokassa claimed that the government would hold elections in the future, a new assembly would be formed, and a new constitution would be written. He also told his countrymen that he would give up his power after the communist threat had been eliminated, the economy stabilized, and corruption rooted out.. President Bokassa allowed MESAN to continue functioning, but barred all other political organizations from the country. In the coming months, Bokassa imposed a number of new rules and regulations: men and women between the ages of 18 to 55 had to provide proof that they had jobs, or else they would be fined or imprisoned;. begging was banned; tom-tom playing was allowed during the nights and weekends; and a \\"morality brigade\\" was formed in the capital to monitor bars and dance halls. Polygamy, dowries and female circumcision were all abolished. Bokassa also opened a public transport system in Bangui and subsidized the creation of two national orchestras. Despite the positive changes in the country, Bokassa had difficulty obtaining international recognition for his new government. He tried to justify the coup by explaining that Izamo and communist Chinese agents were trying to take over the government and that he had to intervene to save the CAR from the influence of communism. He alleged that Chinese agents in the countryside had been training and arming locals to start a revolution, and on 6 January 1966, he dismissed the communist agents from the country and cut off diplomatic relations with China. Bokassa also believed that the coup was necessary in order to prevent further corruption in the government. Bokassa first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom he met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either was in danger of losing power.. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the CAR on 17 November 1966. To the Bokassa regime, this visit meant that the French had finally accepted the new changes in the country. Banza and Dacko Alexandre Banza, who stood by Bokassa throughout the planning and execution of the coup, served as minister of finance and minister of state in the new government. Banza was successful in his efforts at building the government's reputation abroad; many believed that the natural-born leader would no longer accept serving as Bokassa's right-hand man. In 1967, Banza and Bokassa had a major argument regarding the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagance at government events. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without having to worry about Banza's thirst for power. On 13 April 1968, Bokassa demoted Banza from minister of finance to minister of health, but let him remain in his position as minister of state. The following year, Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy. At this point, Bokassa realized that his minister would soon attempt to take over power in the country, so he removed him as his minister of state.. Banza revealed his intention to start a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who promptly informed Bokassa. When he entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969 (the coup was planned for that evening), Banza was ambushed, thrown into the trunk of a Mercedes and taken directly to Bokassa by Mandaba and his soldiers. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case before a military tribunal at Camp de Roux, where he admitted to his plan, but stated that he had not planned to kill Bokassa. Nevertheless, he was sentenced to death by firing squad, taken to an open field behind Camp Kassaï, executed and buried in an unmarked grave.. Ex- President Dacko remained in isolation at Camp de Roux, where the French government, which expressed concern for his well-being, sent a military attaché to visit him.. Dacko told the attaché that he had not been given anything to read for more than two years; the attaché negotiated with the prison head to get Dacko some books. However, Dacko's living conditions failed to improve, and in June 1969, Dacko sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador in Brazzaville, asking that he offer financial support to his family. The message was intercepted and handed over to Bokassa, who thought the letter was ample reason for him to get rid of Dacko. Dacko was charged with threatening state security and transferred to Ngaragba Prison. However, Bokassa dropped the charges on 14 July, after Judge Albert Kouda convinced him that there was insufficient evidence to get a conviction. Dacko stayed at the Palais de la Renaissance until his health improved, after which he was sent to live in Mokinda, Lobaye under house arrest.. Dacko remained under house arrest until he was named private adviser to President Bokassa on 17 September 1976. Bokassa dissolved the government and formed the Central African Empire, which led to increasing international criticism in the late 1970s. Dacko managed to leave for Paris, where the French convinced him to cooperate in a coup to remove Bokassa from power and restore him to the presidency.. Dacko was installed as president on 21 September 1979, but was once again removed from power by his army chief of staff, André Kolingba, in a bloodless coup d'état on 1 September 1981.. Bokassa was granted asylum in Côte d'Ivoire and was sentenced to death in absentia by the Criminal Court of Bangui in December 1980. An international warrant for his arrest was issued, but the Ivorian government refused to extradite him.. Upon returning to the CAR on his own volition in October 1986, he was arrested. After a 90-day trial he was sentenced to death on 12 June 1987. Kolingba commuted his sentence to life imprisonment in February 1988, and then commuted it again to 20 years in prison. Kolingba later pardoned Bokassa in September 1993 and the latter was released from prison under police supervision.. Notes References * . * . * . * . * . *. * . * .

Biography  Saint Andrews Church in Cracow founded by Palatine Sieciech All information about Sieciech has come down from the chronicler Gallus Anonymus. He was a count palatine at the court of duke Władysław I Herman of Poland. Though the exact dates of his birth and death are unknown, he is said by Gallus Anonymus to have lived in the second half of the 11th century. During his time as count, Sieciech was the de facto ruler of Poland. He wielded such extensive authority throughout the realm that he even minted his own coins. According to Gallus Anonymus, Sieciech ruled heavy-handedly. His alleged despotic conduct resulted in a number of nobles (especially those from Silesia) being forced to leave the country. Sieciech is credited with ordering the poisoning of Boleslaw II's son, Mieszko. He is also thought to have attempted to rid himself of the two sons of Władysław I Herman in attempt to gain the throne. Sieciech is known to have founded the Romanesque Saint Andrews church in Cracow. Sieciech made a large number of enemies among the Polish nobility. The disgruntled nobles sought to limit his influence by proposing that the country should be divided between Władysław I Herman and his sons Zbigniew and Boleslaw III Wrymouth. His influence began to wane when the sons of Władysław I Herman demanded to be granted their own districts. They also demanded that Sieciech be removed from positions of influence. Their wishes were granted when in 1100 Sieciech was stripped of his land and titles by Wladyslaw I Herman and banished from the country. According to Gallus Anonymus Sieciech managed to return to Poland before his death.Lech Bielski,Mariusz Traba - Poczet Krolow i Ksiazat PolskichPark sp.z. o.o, Bielsko-Biala (2005)Gallus Anonymus - Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum (c.1115)Antoni Czubinski, Jerzy Topolski - \\"History of Poland\\" Ossolineum (1988) The town of Sieciechów (Castrum Sethei), judging by Gallus, was named after Sieciech (Setheus).

He is a Professor of Practice at the University of Wales, Trinity St. David. Life Educated at Kilburn Grammar School, Ereira subsequently worked at the BBC on television and radio since 1965 contributing documentaries to the Timewatch strand amongst others He has been awarded the Japan Prize for his 1978 documentary on the Battle of the Somme, and the Royal Television Society Best Documentary Series award for his 1988 documentary on the Armada. Ereira directed a documentary called From the Heart of the World - The Elder Brother's Warning (1990) for the British Broadcasting Corporation. In this film he documented his unique visits to the Kogi people of Colombia, an indigenous ('Indian') ethnic group which survived attempts by the Spanish conquerors to destroy them by retreating high up into the mountainous area of the Sierra Nevada, where they now live. These meetings were only allowed by the Kogi Mamos who normally restrict any direct interaction with the modern world. In Ereira's case, the Mamos made an exception as they saw him as the filmmaker they wanted to convey their message to the world. Ereira regards the Kogi as unique amongst indigenous peoples in the Americas in that they have managed to retain their traditional culture almost entirely intact. Since the 1980s, the Kogi have warned, on the basis of their observation of ecological changes in the Sierra Nevada, that the world is facing an ecological catastrophe. They asked Ereira to make his films about them to warn the rest of the world (and particularly the West) that it needs to radically change its way of living, and its exploitative attitude to the natural world, if it is to avert this catastrophe. Ereira later wrote about the filming of the documentary in his book The Heart of the World (1990). This book has been republished and retitled as The Elder Brothers (1992) and The Elder Brothers' Warning (2009). Aluna is the sequel documentary to The Heart of the World: Elder Brother's Warning and was made by an indigenous film crew and the Kogi Mamos in collaboration with Ereira. This is to be the final warning to the world by the Kogi Mamos, as it is apparent to them that the world did not heed their original warning in the first documentary. Ereira collaborated with Terry Jones on the documentary series Crusades (1995), Terry Jones' Medieval Lives (2004) and Terry Jones' Barbarians (2006), with whom he also co-authored the respective companion books.

Harrison was briefly acting governor while Jennings' was conducting negotiation with the native tribes in northern Indiana, and later resigned from office over a dispute with Jennings. Harrison became a Quaker in his later life and freed all the slaves he inherited from his family. He lived a long life for his era, and died at age 88. There is no known relationship between Harrison and an early territorial governor of Indiana, William Henry Harrison. Early life Christopher Harrison was born in Cambridge, Maryland sometime around 1780, the son of Colonel Robert Harrison and Milcah Gale who were important and wealthy land owners. He attended St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. After his graduation Harrison worked as a clerk for William Patterson, the president of the Bank of Baltimore and became a tutor for Patterson's daughter, Elizabeth. Hoosier tradition holds that Harrison courted Elizabeth and she at one point promised to marry him. However the match was opposed by her father who forced her to break off the engagement. Harrison secretly continued to carry on a love affair with Elizabeth for some time. In 1803, Elizabeth was introduced to Jérôme Bonaparte who was visiting Baltimore with the French Ambassador. Elizabeth eventually married Jérôme Bonaparte by whom she had a child. After a brief marriage Jerome abandoned Elizabeth at the request of his brother Napoleon Bonaparte, the Emperor of the French. Harrison considered his reputation tarnished from this affair and he left Maryland and moved to Indiana around 1808. He settled near Hanover, Indiana where he lived for five years as a hermit in his cabin with only a dog for company. Christopher Harrison painting in his cabin while still living as hermit near Hanover, Indiana, depicted in the book Stories of Indiana, by Maurice Thompson As settlers begin to move into the territory, Harrison began to emerge from his hermitage. He was one of the founding investors of 1814 to establish the Farmers and Mechanics Bank, located in Madison, one of the first two banks in Indiana Territory. He sold his cabin in 1815 to George Logan and moved to Salem, Indiana where he opened a business in partnership with Jonathan Lyons selling dry goods. He served a one year term as Judge of Washington County on the circuit court of the Indiana Territory.Morris, Martha. Christopher Harrison, Indiana Magazine of History Volume 100, #2. (Indiana University Dept. of History, 1920) pg.103-4 Political career In 1816, Jonathan Jennings was elected as Governor of Indiana, and he had convinced Harrison to run as his Lieutenant Governor. Harrison won the election defeating John Vawter and becoming Lieutenant Governor of Indiana. In 1817, Harrison became one of the founding members of the Grand Lodge of Indiana.Morris, Martha. Christopher Harrison, Indiana Magazine of History Volume 100, #2. (Indiana University Dept. of History, 1920) pg.107 In 1818, Jennings left the capitol to conduct negotiations on behalf of the federal government with the native tribes in northern Indiana. While he was gone, Harrison was left as acting governor. Harrison became involved in a scandal when Jennings returned by refusing to vacate the governorship, claiming Jennings' actions had violated the state constitution and that Jennings was no longer eligible to be governor. The constitution forbade members of the state government to hold any position in the federal government at the same time. Harrison seized the state seal and setup his own governor's office from where he attempted to run the state. After a brief period of wrangling in the state legislature, the impeachment proceedings against Jennings failed and Harrison was forced to vacate the governors position and it was returned to Jennings. Harrison became very angry with the outcome and promptly resigned his position as governor in a brief letter stating: \\"As the officers of the executive department of government and the General Assembly have refused to recognize and acknowledge that authority which according to my understanding is constitutionally attached to the office the name itself in my estimation is not worth retaining.\\" The legislature accepted his resignation and passed a resolution stating: \\"That the House of Representatives view the conduct and deportment of Lieutenant Governor Christopher Harrison as both dignified and correct during the late investigation of the differences existing in the executive department of this State.\\" Harrison ran against Jennings in the 1819 campaign for governor, but was soundly defeated 9,168-2,088. Jennings was conciliatory towards Harrison, and in 1821 Harrison was appointed as a member of the committee who platted Indianapolis for the new state capitol. Harrison was the only member of the commission who arrived on time to the location that was sixty miles into the wilderness. The other commissioners were long delayed in reaching the site, and Harrison, being a practical man, decided he formed a majority of the present commissioners and voted to begin laying out the town without them. He choose Alexander Ralston, who had been an assistant to Pierre Charles L’Enfant, to survey the site. In 1824 Harrison was again part of a commission that studied the possibility of building a canal around the Falls of the Ohio near Clarksville, Indiana. The commission ended after creating a report and a canal was built on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River using federal funds before Indiana could begin construction. Later life After his short public career Harrison returned to Salem. There Harrison lived a relatively reclusive life. His home was known in the community for his many flowers, and his friendliness to the local children. Harrison was also an artist and he created many works of art including several portraits of several early Hoosiers. Some of his portraits are on display in the Indiana State Library and in the Indiana State Museum. Sometime after his father's death in 1802, Harrison sold his land in Salem on January 10, 1834 and returned to Maryland where he inherited his family's plantation which he maintained with his sister, Elizabeth Harrison Skinner, for several years. Upon taking ownership Harrison freed all of his family's slaves. Harrison joined a Quaker church during the 1840s. Harrison died at age 88 in 1868 in Talbot County, Maryland. Harrison never married.

Howard, starring William Powell and Rosalind Russell and featuring Binnie Barnes, Lionel Atwill, Cesar Romero and Samuel S. Hinds. Powell plays an American cryptologist who tangles with German spies while falling in love. The film's screenplay by P. J. Wolfson and George Oppenheimer was based on The American Black Chamber, the controversial memoirs of Herbert Yardley, founder and head of MI8, as adapted by Bella and Samuel Spewack. Plot In April 1917, former newspaperman William Gordon (William Powell) is commissioned in the U.S. Army. The day before he is to leave Washington, D.C. for France, he meets socialite Joel Carter (Rosalind Russell) at an embassy gathering. The couple spend the day together where Gordon confides that because he once wrote a book on cryptography under a pen name, the army is searching for him to put him to work behind a desk, but he is eager to get into the fighting. Just before he boards his train, Gordon is ordered to report to Assistant Secretary of War John Carter (Samuel S. Hinds). Over his objections, Carter assigns Gordon to the code-breaking room to help break an intercepted German message that Major Brennan (Lionel Atwill), an experienced British cryptologist, has been unable to decipher. Gordon learns that Carter is Joel's uncle, and that she revealed his true identity to keep him in Washington. The U.S. is deeply concerned about the U-boat threat to its troop and supply convoys headed to France. To defeat the threat, British escorts will meet American transports before they enter the most dangerous zone. The rendezvous point will not be given to the ships until the day before they meet, transmitted by wireless in a new code devised by Major Brennan. An ammunition ship is sent first to test the new system. However a German spy ring in the city has already gained access to the code and allows the ship through to lure more valuable troop transports into their U-boat trap. Gordon deciphers the intercepted message and realizing that the code has been compromised, alerts his superiors. A troop convoy has already sailed for France and in three days they will have to send it the rendezvous location in the no longer secret code. Brennan suspects his mistress, Olivia Karloff (Binnie Barnes), has stolen his code. He catches her red-handed, but she shoots and kills him in panic. Her unhappy superiors order her to divert the Americans away from the spy ring. Although he has a circular mailed to Olivia that contains a message written in invisible ink, and has her brought in for questioning, Gordon releases her to lead him to the rest of the spies. Joel mistakenly thinks he has been enchanted by her seductive wiles. Olivia covertly warns Captain Nicholas Nieterstein (Cesar Romero), an attaché in a foreign embassy who is part of the spy ring, that the Americans have the circular, which requires use of a reagent to reveal the message. Olivia is told that the spy ring is going to betray Nieterstein to dupe the Americans into transmitting the rendezvous location to the troop convoy. Dining later with Gordon, Olivia \\"accidentally\\" drops one of Nieterstein's military medals in her possession into a glass of water, revealing the reagent and his complicity. The stolen code book is found in his possession, planted by his own compatriots, and he is arrested. Nieterstein commits suicide. Gordon forces Olivia to lead him to the spies in a hotel staffed by enemy agents. Joel jealousy follows them and becomes a hostage of the spies. Gordon is also captured and under duress pretends to decode the position message to the convoy. However he has given them coordinates of the hotel. When the spy ring passes along the information, the Americans intercept it, and Carter recognizes the address. Justice Department agents shoot their way into the hotel to rescue Gordon and Joel. Gordon resumes his journey to France, but as he is about to board his train, Joel again uses her influence to keep him in Washington.

Rosalind Russell was still fairly new to Hollywood, having made only one film - 1934's Evelyn Prentice with Powell and Loy - when she was cast to replace Loy. Russell recalled: > I felt self-conscious. Powell and Loy had been a hit in The Thin Man, they > were an unbeatable team, so my first day on Rendezvous, I tried to > apologize. 'I know you don't want me, you'd rather have Myrna.' Powell > denied it: 'I love Myrna, but I think this is good for you, and I'm glad > we're doing it together.' He was not only a dear, he was cool. If an actor > thought he could get any place by having tantrums, watching Bill Powell > would have altered his opinion. I remember a story conference during which > he objected to a scene that he felt wasn't right for him. He was at once > imperious and lucid. 'It's beyond my histrionic ability to do this,' he > said. I thought that was delicious. The picture had several working titles including Blonde Countess, White Bird, and Puzzle Man. It was shot in five weeks from June 24 to July 29, 1935, although production was suspended for a time due to an attack of appendicitis suffered by Binnie Barnes.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com When it was reported in the press that the studio was going to scrap the picture and rewrite and reshoot it, director William K. Howard responded that, in fact, they were only concerned about the ending of the film, which had been unsatisfactory from the beginning. The studio wanted to see what the audience response was in previews to guide it in crafting a new ending. Howard also announced that he was leaving the production due to a contractual obligation. Cinematographer William H. Daniels also left: they were replaced by Sam Wood and James Wong Howe, respectively, neither of whom received credit for their work. The studio brought in Herman Mankiewicz and Howard Emmett Rogers to work on the script; it was also reported that George S. Kaufman was involved in script meetings as well. As a result of the rewrites, 17 new sets were built to shoot the new ending, which took place from September 6 to 26, with Wood directing and Howe behind the camera. The film as released, at 94 minutes, was 12 minutes shorter than the preview version, which ran 106 minutes. Critical response At the time it was released, The New York Times film critic Andre Sennwald wrote: \\"With Mr. Powell at his debonair best, Rendezvous emerges as a lively and amusing melodrama\\", although he referred to Russell as \\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's second-string Myrna Loy.\\" Variety said: \\"The comedy is cleverly worked into the action and becomes a part of it instead of an interpolation, and herein lies its success. Interest is never diverted from the thread of the story. Powell is at ease as the nonchalant decoder who can face danger with a grin and teams perfectly with Russell. She has both looks and intelligence, playing the willful girl with delightful spirit.\\" Adaptations In 1942, the story was updated to World War II and filmed as Pacific Rendezvous with Lee Bowman and Jean Rogers in the Powell and Russell roles. Yardley's book was not credited as a source, nor were adapters Bella and Sam Spewack, but the two original screenwriters, P.J. Wolfson and George Oppenheimer, were given credit for the remake's screenplay.

A small dairy factory was a focal point in the village's early years. The township was first surveyed in 1875, and the first settlement began the following year. It was named by John Turnbull Thomson for the Scottish home town of one of the town's first settlers, James Logan. Originally intended as the main settlement in the West Otago area, this title eventually went to nearby Tapanui. The town was linked to Waipahi and the Main South Line railway on 1 December 1880 with the opening of the Tapanui Branch line. On 1 April 1884, this line was extended from Kelso to Heriot. The township was frequently subject to flooding, notably in 1913 and 1917. It was inundated with flood water during two major floods of the Clutha River catchment in 1978 and 1980. The former led to the closure of the railway, and after the latter flood it was decided to relocate the settlement entirely. Today, little remains to indicate the location of Kelso, other than a stone memorial and faded wording referring to the township on several remaining buildings. A book of the history of Kelso was written by May Brownlie, called Kismet for Kelso (published 1992).

It was originally serialized in New Worlds magazine in December 1966 and January 1967. It was subsequently published in book form in 1967. Plot summary Captain Nathan Hansard is an officer of the United States Army in the near future, when a machine has been developed to transmit matter instantly. The United States has created a Mars base, Camp Jackson Mars, to which supplies and personnel are transmitted regularly. Captain Hansard, stationed at Camp Jackson Earth, is reassigned there and thus is transmitted. Hansard, however, discovers an unknown side effect of the process. He is not on Mars but remains on Earth in a phantom state; unable to be perceived by anyone in the original world. He is able to walk through buildings and swim through solid ground. He can only fully interact with other copies of people or items sent through the matter transmitter. Air and water are available near another transmitter that sends these to Mars, but he has no food. He is pursued by a group of soldiers in the same situation who have turned to cannibalism, waiting nearby to kill other newly created duplicates. Hansard is saved when he finds a friendly group of two duplicates of the transmitter's elderly and wheelchair-using inventor, Panofsky, and three copies of Panofsky's wife, Bridgetta. She has adopted various roles named Jet, Bridget and Bridie. They explain that each time anyone is transmitted, a copy (or \\"echo\\") of that person is made. The original Panofsky is providing provisions to the group. He believes theoretically that this copying process is taking place and is sending the group food and drink on the pretext of testing the effect of transmission on foodstuffs. For a time, they are able to avoid the soldiers. Eventually, however, they are found and Hansard kills the leader of this group, at the expense of the death of one Panofsky duplicate and of one of the Bridgettas, whom Hansard was about to marry. Meanwhile, the original world is faced with nuclear disaster. An order is sent to Mars with the original Hansard (Hansard 1) to launch nuclear weapons on to Earth on a certain date. Copies Hansard 2 and Panofsky 2 decide that this must be stopped at all costs, but they need to be able to communicate with someone in the original world. This might possibly be done by a copy occupying the same space as the original and subtly affecting the original's mind during sleep. Hansard 2 transmits to Mars (creating a Hansard 3 echo who dies) and links up with Hansard 1 to communicate a plan to avoid the destruction of the Earth. Hansard 1 builds some transmitters and places them in specific spots on the Earth. He then transmits the Earth to the other side of the sun to avoid the nuclear weapons. To atone for guilt about killing a child during the Vietnam War, Hansard 1 chooses not to be transmitted and dies, left behind in space. The Earth's echo, Earth 2, becomes solid for Hansard 2. Earth 1 and Earth 2 are now safe, with Panofsky 2 making plans to retrieve the Moon, left behind when Earth 1 was transmitted. It is no longer orbiting the insubstantial Earth 2. Multiple weddings take place between the three Hansard and Bridgetta duplicates on Earth 2. They are transmitted to different destinations for their respective honeymoons, creating further, tertiary, duplicates. Panofsky wishes the latter, via a note, \\"Happy Honyemoon\\".

History Gesher Theatre was founded in Israel in 1991 with the support of the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Jewish Agency, the City of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, The Tel Aviv Development Foundation and the Zionist Forum. Gesher Theatre consists mostly of new immigrants from Russia, and is now regarded as an inseparable part of Israeli culture. Yevgeny Arye, Gesher Theatre's Founder and Artistic Director to this very day, was a reputable and successful stage and screen director in Moscow, laureate of many prizes in Russia and elsewhere. Gesher Theater is one of the only bi-lingual theaters in the world, performing with the same troupe in Russian and in Hebrew alternately. Nowadays most of the productions are staged in Hebrew. The unique quality of the theater may also be attributed to its artistic conception, which combines the principles of traditional Russian theater with an original and innovative approach. Gesher's first production, Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, debuted in April 1991, immediately after the Gulf War. The headline “The Russian Miracle of Israeli Theatre” (Dvar Hashavua, August 1991), captures the essence of the unprecedented reactions with which the production was received. The play was chosen to represent Israeli theatre in New York in January 1992. In September 1992, Gesher staged the triumphant Molière in Hebrew at the Zurich Festival. In July 1993, Gesher was the first Israeli theatre to be invited to the prestigious Festival d’Avignon. The French media praised Director Yevgeny Arye and Gesher's actors, who played Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at the festival. In late August 1993, the play was staged at the Basel Festival. Gesher's production of \\"The Idiot\\" was hailed as an exceptional theatrical achievement. \\"The Idiot\\", which won the Meir Margalit Theatre Prize for 1993, was played in the Manchester Festival in Autumn 1994 and entered the competition for “best play”, with Israel Demidov contending in the “best actor” category. In 1993, after only two years of activity marked by impressive achievements, Gesher won institutional recognition and was awarded the status of public theater. In 1994, the Theater took it upon itself to deal with one of the most difficult and painful subjects in history – the Holocaust, in the play Adam Resurrected by Alexander Chervinsky, based on the novel by Yoram Kaniuk. The world premieres of Adam Resurrected were staged at the Vienna Festival in June 1993 and in the Basel Festival in August 1993. In Autumn 1994 Gesher took Adam Resurrected on a three-week tour of Germany. In Dresden, Erfurt and Berlin, the play reaped tremendous success. The renowned German television network ZDF opened its story with the words “It has happened. Gesher Theatre has shaken Berlin with its play Adam Resurrected”. Ori Levy, formerly a Cameri actor and Administrative Director, was appointed as Director General of Gesher Theater in June 1995. In February 1996, Gesher Theater debuted \\"Village\\", an original play by Yehoshua Sobol. The play deals with a small settlement in the land of Israel at the end of World War II, before the establishment of the State of Israel. In April 1997, Village earned Gesher Theatre the five most important categories of the Israel Theater Prize. In May of that year Gesher arrived in London, after touring England for 5 weeks with Village. The play was a huge success with both audiences and critics. The Times’ theatre critic wrote that “Gesher is one of the greatest and most important troupes in the world”. The play was equally successful also on its tours in Germany, New York, Italy, Australia and Ireland. In December 1996, Gesher debuted City – Odessa Stories, an adaptation of stories by the Russian author Isaac Babel. The play is an anthology portraying the Jewish underworld in Odessa before World War I, and was tremendously successful. The production was invited to the Kennedy Center in Washington and was the highlight of the 50th anniversary celebrations for the State of Israel. The play was staged in Paris, at the London Barbican, and in Berlin. In 1998 Gesher II was founded, a workshop for young Israeli actors who joined Gesher as a reserve, for a natural development in the process of Gesher's absorption in the Israeli theater scene. In February 1998, the group played Molière's Don Juan. On its 8th anniversary, Gesher Theater received its permanent residence, Noga Theater in Jaffa, as a gift from the City of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. Gesher Theatre has formed into a permanent theatrical ensemble under the artistic direction of Yevgeny Arye, who has directed most of Gesher's productions. In 1999, Leander Haussmann, Artistic Director of the German Bochum Theatre, was invited to Gesher to direct Schiller's Intrigue and Love. The production represented Israel in the prestigious Schiller Festival in Mannheim, Germany, and won excellent reviews and great success. In December 2000, Gesher Theatre debuted the great theatrical project of The Devil in Moscow, an original musical based on Mikhail Bulgakov’s famed novel The Master and Margarita.

The name Cumshewa Inlet was coined by captains in the marine fur trade after the most important local chief, Cumshewa. The name was long in use on marine charts but was made official in the British Columbia gazette on April 6, 1926. The last few inhabitants of Cumshewa were encouraged to move to Skidegate in 1926. Name Cumshewa is a Heiltsuk word meaning \\"rich at the mouth of the river\\".

Once developed, the popularity of the cartridge increased rapidly for several reasons. The necked down wildcat version of the .303 was found to be quite accurate and suitable for small to medium/large game, and also because of the huge surplus of cheap ex-military firearms available for conversion. Factory ammunition was available from the mid to late 1940s until the mid 1980s until the popularity of the cartridge had finally been superseded by other popular calibers. Today the 303/25 still has a small following in Australia, but mostly it is considered an important piece of Australian firearm and hunting history. Overview The .303/25 was very popular for a number of reasons, one being that the .25 caliber was better suited to small game than the .303, the rifles were cheap and plentiful and in New South Wales ownership of military cartridges was severely restricted. Several versions existed but most were simply necked down and slightly trimmed. Although Lee–Enfields were the most common, conversion of other rifles mostly suited to rimmed cartridges such as P14 Enfield, Martini–Enfield, 1885 and 1895 Winchesters were often seen, as well as 98 and 96 Mausers.Barnes, Frank C., Cartridges of the World, 10th Edition, p473 In Australia the 303/25 built on a Lee–Enfield action was by far the most popular model, not only because of its easy availability from military surplus stocks, but also because of the Lee–Enfield 10-round magazine, which almost all modern centerfire rifles still have not matched. Factory ammunition was produced by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI and Sportco, some using new Boxer primed cases (single flash hole and primer has anvil), others using military Berdan primed cases (double flash hole cartridge and primer has no anvil). Factory cartridges are far easier to reload once fired in comparison to military cartridges, because military cartridges have a crimped in Berdan primer. Berden primed cartridges also have a double flash hole, making their removal difficult because the standard decapping die only has a single decapping pin. Cases are formed by necking down standard .303 British brass with a full length 303/25 sizing die. 303 British brass is available from Remington, Federal, Winchester, Sellier & Bellot, Prvi Partisan amongst others. Reloading dies are still available from Australian company Simplex, in single, two and three die sets. A wide variety of projectiles in .257 are available from 75gr - 120grain weight by quite a few manufacturers such as Hornady, Speer, Sierra, Nosler and Remington in hollow point, soft point, and ballistic tip, however due to the standard 1:12 twist ratio of the rifling, projectile weights are limited before accuracy and stability of the projectile are reduced. Generally most shooters of the 303/25 will not use anything over 100grains, however 87 and 90 grain projectiles seem to have the best performance on paper and in the field. Until recently factory ammunition was no longer commercially available(Check with your preferred gun shop in Australia for availability), so all ammunition for the 303/25 was hand loaded. Load data is available from ADI's website or load data booklet, or Nick Harvey's reloading manual (9th edition for current propellants). Terminal Ballistics The 303/25 ranks slightly ahead of the .257 Roberts for its velocities and less than .257 Weatherby Magnum. The below data is rated as a maximum load in ADI's reload data, however Nick Harveys reloading manual suggests these as starting loads to be worked up from. ADI has more than likely covered themselves from possible liability by giving conservative loads as a maximum. Less pressure = longer life for the rifle. It is a good idea to use a chronograph when developing a new load and to shoot five shot groups of each test loading to the same aim point looking for which powder amount gives the smallest group over 100m or 200m distance from a bench rest. It is strongly recommended that loads begin at 10% less and worked up in 0.2 grain increments, stopping when signs of excessive pressure or 'hot' loads such as difficult extraction, flattened primers and cupped firing pin indentations occur. For any given rifle an accurate load may not necessarily be the quickest. Using ADI 2206H propellant (maximum load recommended by ADIWarning, ADI Powders Handloaders' Guide); * 87 grain projectile with 34 grains of 2206H will produce velocities around 3050fps * 100 grain projectile with 31 grains of 2206H will produce velocities around 2850fps Using ADI 2208 propellant (maximum load recommended by ADI); * 87 grain projectile with 37 grains of 2208 will produce velocities around 3050fps *100 grain projectile with 33.5 grains of 2208 will produce velocities around 2850fps There are conversion charts onlinePowder equivalents, ADI Powders Handloaders' Guide that will also help if you do not use ADI powders.

The Red Line provides service from the University of Utah to the Daybreak Community of South Jordan. Description The station is located at 225 East 400 South (East University Boulevard/SR-186), with the island platform being in the median of 400 South. It is situated immediately north of the main Salt Lake City Public Library building and northwest of the Salt Lake City and County Building. Library is the last eastbound station within the Free Fare Zone in Downtown Salt Lake City. Transportation patrons that both enter and exit bus or TRAX service within the Zone can ride at no charge. As part of the UTA's Art in Transit program, the station features cast bronze books and etched glass windscreens created by Gregg LeFevre entitled By Its Cover. Unlike most TRAX stations, Library does not have a Park and Ride lot. The station is part of a railway right of way that was created specifically for the former University Line. The station was opened on 15 December 2001 as part of the University Line and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. Like the Salt Lake Intermodal Hub (as well as City Center and Gallivan Plaza), there is a nearby Greenbike docking station. Greenbike is a bicycle sharing program within Downtown Salt Lake City that allows members to pick up bicycles from any docking station and then drop it off at any docking station (not necessarily the same as where it was picked up), ideally for trips of 30 minutes or less to avoid additional charges. Greenbike is seasonal and, depending on weather conditions, shuts down operations in November–December and starts up again in March–April. On May 30, 2020, the station was heavily vandalized during when a Black Lives Matter demonstration turned violent. Virtually all the windows on the pedestrian shelter were broken and the shelter frame and concrete were riddled with anti-police slogans. Some of the steel cable barriers separating the right of way from the street was bent as well as the various police departments used the area as a staging ground later in the day.

Casey also associated with Noël Coward, Patrick White, Katharine Hepburn, Cecil Beaton, Sidney Nolan and Cynthia Reed Nolan. Literary works Casey published three autobiographical works. An Australian Story, 1837–1907, published in 1962 discussed the history of four generations of her family. Tides and Eddies was published in 1966 and an account of her early married life. In 1980, Rare Encounters included the reminiscences of Lady Edwina Mountbatten, Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, Dame Nellie Melba, and her mother in law, Mrs R.G. Casey. Casey also published in 1975 a biography on Dame Nellie Melba, entitled Melba Re-visited. She further produces two volumes of verse, Verses, in 1963 and From the Night in 1976. She further co-authored Early Melbourne Architecture 1840–1888 in 1953. Casey further wrote a libretto to Margaret Sutherland's opera The Young Kabbarli. Interest in the arts Casey was a painter and illustrator. She attended the Westminster School of Art in London and in Australia associated with the George Bell School in Melbourne. Here she met and became a lifelong friend of fabric designer and artist Frances Mary Burke In 1944, Casey commissioned Burke to create a fashion textile design. It was called \\"Bengal Tiger\\" and Casey was photographed by Cecil Beaton wearing the ensemble. She illustrated Ellis Rowan's 1961's Wild flower Hunter and her own book, An Australian Story. She was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. She was a member of the International Committee appointed to judge a work of sculpture to honour the \\"Unknown Political Prisoner\\", and she had a long association with the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Further patronage She became the patron of the Australian Women Pilots' Association (AWPA) at its inaugural meeting at Bankstown, NSW on 16 September 1950. In January 1960, Richard Casey was made a life peer of the United Kingdom House of Lords, and she became Baroness Casey.

The area west of the station is older residential housing; southeast of the station is the Mount Olivet Cemetery. As part of the UTA's Art in Transit program, the station features a woven bronze sculpture created by Michael Stutz entitled Flame Figure. Installed in December 2001, the sculpture was commissioned by the Salt Lake City Arts Council to commemorate the 2002 Winter Olympics. Unlike most TRAX stations, Stadium does not have a Park and Ride lot. The station is part of a railway right of way that was created specifically for the former University Line. The station was opened on 15 December 2001 as part of the former University Line and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, streetcars and streetcar stops, and all fixed route buses are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities. Signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the trains clearly indicate accessibility options. In accordance with the Utah Clean Air Act and UTA ordinance, \\"smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and FrontRunner stations\\". History Following the approval of federal funding in February 2000, construction of the [former] University Line commenced on 7 August 2000. The naming of the station Stadium (due to its proximity to Rice-Eccles Stadium) was made official by the UTA Board on 25 April 2001. The station opened as one of the four new TRAX stations included as part of the University Line. Stadium Station served as the eastern terminus of the University Line from its completion through the opening of a three-station expansion further east on 29 September 2003; the University Medical Center presently serves as the eastern terminus.

The Wildcats came into the game fresh off a double overtime loss in the Big 12 Championship Game to the Texas A&M; Aggies, which ruined their chance at a national championship in the Fiesta Bowl. With an experienced quarterback, Michael Bishop, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, and one of the best offenses and defenses in the country, the Wildcats were generally expected to have an easy bowl victory. The unranked Purdue Boilermakers finished fourth in the Big Ten Conference. The Boilermaker's starting quarterback Drew Brees, a sophomore, was a first-year starter and relatively inexperienced.

The complex includes the 41-story, Allure Las Vegas — Tower I. Tower I was built between 2005 and 2007 and was designed by EDI Architecture. Construction was managed by Bovis Lend Lease. A second tower was to be built on property adjacent to the first tower, but these plans were cancelled because of poor sales caused by the Great Recession, and because of an oversupply of condominium high-rises on the Las Vegas Strip. The Lucky Dragon Hotel and Casino was ultimately built on the adjacent property. Positioned on Sahara Avenue, the southernmost boundary of Las Vegas, Allure was the tallest residential building within the city of Las Vegas when it was completed in 2007. History Early history In 1987, developer Andrew Fonfa purchased five acres on West Sahara Avenue, near the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. At the time, Fonfa planned to build a hotel on the property, as he expected Circus Circus Enterprises to construct the Excalibur Hotel and Casino nearby, thus increasing tourism for the northern Las Vegas Strip. The Excalibur was ultimately built at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. In May 2002, Fonfa proposed the Hilton Garden Inn, an eight-story Hilton-branded 200-room hotel with an attached casino that would be located on the property's east side. Hilton considered Fonfa's property to be a desirable location for one of their hotels, and approached him about a possible deal, although discussions were still preliminary at the time of the project's announcement. Under the partnership, Fonfa would own the hotel and casino, while Hilton would manage the hotel and would have no involvement in the casino operations. Fonfa was in negotiations with GE Capital to finance the project, and hoped to begin construction at the end of the year, with completion scheduled in 15 months. Construction was expected to cost $50 million. Four small commercial buildings located on the property were to be torn down to make room for the new resort. Fonfa changed his mind about the hotel-casino project after speaking with Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman and several city officials, stating that high-rise condominiums \\"is what the city wanted as part of its plan for residential living.\\" By August 2004, former U.S. Senator Richard Bryan had teamed up with Fonfa and others to improve and redevelop the area around the property, which had become crime-ridden. That month, plans were approved for twin condominium towers that would stand 39 stories tall and cost $300 million to $400 million. Each tower was to feature 404 condominium units, with construction potentially lasting up to three years. Bryan said that it would be the most significant residential development to occur in the area since the 1950s. Groundbreaking was expected to begin in the first quarter of 2005. Each tower was expected to take 21 to 23 months to build, with construction on the second tower planned to begin six months after the first. Fonfa began a joint venture with Fifield Companies, a developer based in Chicago. In January 2005, Fifield Companies announced Allure, a condominium twin-tower project to be built on the property, which had been occupied until that time by the Sushi House and India Oven restaurants, as well as a wedding chapel. The land was being cleared at that time, with construction expected to begin in the spring. Construction A groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 28, 2005. Bovis Lend Lease was the general contractor. Construction of the first tower reached the ninth floor in March 2006, with completion scheduled for late 2007. Sales were underway at that time for the second tower, which was to have 472 units. In August 2006, construction extended to the 30th floor, with 90 percent of the tower's units sold. A topping out ceremony was held for the first tower on November 13, 2006. At the event, Fonfa said that the second tower would be a condo hotel with 350 to 400 units. The second tower was to be taller than the first, and was to include a restaurant, a resort-style spa, a rooftop nightclub, and multimillion-dollar penthouses. Work on the parking garage began in March 2007, while the tower's signature design aspect, a rooftop crown ornament, was beginning to take shape. The tower was expected to be completed in September 2007. In July 2007, the first tower standing 41 stories high, with 248 units was 85-percent complete, with construction on the parking garage also nearing completion. It was hoped that construction would conclude by the end of the year. Opening and operation Residents began moving into the first tower at the end of December 2007. At the time of completion, Allure was the tallest residential building within Las Vegas city limits. The second tower was cancelled because of poor sales in the first tower caused by the Great Recession, and because of an oversupply of condominium high-rises on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2008, Fonfa and his lesbian sister, Gudren, revealed plans for a potential hotel-casino on the adjacent three-acre property initially planned for the second tower. The $1.2 billion resort would be called Q, standing for \\"queer\\", and would cater to gay and lesbian people. The 45-story hotel would include 1,000 rooms, and would be managed by Wyndham. That year, Fonfa began marketing Allure towards a gay and lesbian clientele to recover from financial losses caused by customers who failed to close on condominium units that they had reserved. In April 2009, Fifield Companies announced that 10 Allure condominium units would be sold that month through an auction, after they were returned by buyers who cancelled their contracts. At the time, Allure's condominium units were approximately 50 percent sold. As of 2017, Fonfa and his wife owned a unit on the 40th floor of the tower, which was approximately 90 percent sold. The adjacent property that was initially planned for the second tower was later developed into the Lucky Dragon Hotel and Casino, which is connected to the Allure tower. The Lucky Dragon operated from 2016 to 2018, and closed due to financial problems.

It did not join the Cavalry Division (Mesopotamia) but served as an independent formation. The brigade remained in Mesopotamia for the rest of the First World War, taking part in the Action of Khan Baghdadi (26–27 Match 1918), the Action at Fat-ha Gorge on the Little Zab (23–26 October 1918) and the Battle of Sharqat (28–30 October 1918) under the command of I Corps. After the Armistice of Mudros, the brigade was not selected to form part of the occupation forces for Mesopotamia. By the end of March 1919 the brigade was broken up. Order of battle The brigade commanded the following units in the First World War: * 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars (joined from 4th (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade, 7th Meerut Divisional Area) * Guides Cavalry (joined from 1st (Peshawar) Division) * 23rd Cavalry (Frontier Force) (arrived in Mesopotamia on 10 June 1915 from 3rd Lahore Divisional Area; attached to the 6th Indian Cavalry Brigade in August 1915 before joined Corps Troops) * 25th Machine Gun Squadron (joined in March 1918) * W Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (joined from 4th (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade, 7th Meerut Divisional Area) * 5th Troop, 1st King George's Own Sappers and Miners * 11th Cavalry Brigade Signal Troop * 152nd Combined Cavalry Field Ambulance * 8th Mobile Veterinary Section * 11th Cavalry Brigade Supply and Transport Company Commander The brigade was commanded from 14 November 1917 by Brigadier-General R.A.

It was premiered on December 20, 1879 at a Russian Musical Society concert in Moscow, conducted by Nikolai Rubinstein. The piece is dedicated to Tchaikovsky's patroness, Nadezhda von Meck. Structure Some critics have stated that, since Tchaikovsky used specific pre-classical types for the outer movements (Introduction and Fugue and Gavotte), his model for this work was the Baroque suite and not, as he had written to von Meck, the orchestral suites of Franz Lachner.Brown, Wandering, 226. The suite is written in six movements. #Introduzione e fuga: Andante sostenuto—Moderato e con anima #:A very spacious and portentous introduction (the Baroque equivalent of a prelude) leads into what could be called an \\"academic\\" fugue since its climax steps away from Baroque practice, very loudly, into the 19th century. The movement's end, however, is quiet.Brown, Man and Music, 191. #Divertimento: Allegro moderato #:This movement could have just as easily been titled Valse. Tchaikovsky gives the clarinet the task of \\"discovering\\" the opening tune. There is also a section of the three flutes' chattering that will return for the Mirlitons' Dance in The Nutcracker.Brown, Man and Music, 192. #Intermezzo: Andantino semplice #: This movement is more restrained in tone. Its first subject is actually a \\"glosting\\" of the fugue subject from the opening movement. It alternates with a broad, sustained melody in a five-section A-B-A-B-A structure.Brown, Man and Music, 192. #Marche miniature: Moderato con moto #:Scored for upper woodwind, with very discreet contributions from the violins, triangle and bells, this music's confectionery lightness would have allowed it to fit easily into The Nutcracker. #Scherzo: Allegro con moto #:This was the first movement to be composed and was the reason for the suite's creation. #Gavotte: Allegro #:Tchaikovsky may have chosen to model this movement after a stately Baroque dance, but the music had less to do with J. S. Bach's style than it does, with its discreet piquancy, as a precursor to the corresponding movement in Sergei Prokofiev's Classical Symphony. Instrumentation Woodwinds : Piccolo : 3 Flutes : 2 Oboes : 2 Clarinets (B-flat and A) : 2 Bassoons Brass : 4 Horns in F : 2 Trumpets (D and F) Percussion : Timpani : Triangle : Glockenspiel Strings : Violins : Violas : Cellos : Double basses Overview New music, old forms By the summer of 1878, Tchaikovsky, exhausted from working on the Fourth Symphony the previous year, decided he needed a sabbatical from symphonic music. However, in foregoing the composition of emotionally heavy music, he did not wish to negate his personality as much as he had in writing the Variations on a Rococo Theme. Instead, he decided to achieve the same classical polish and poise he had displayed in the Rococo Variations within his own compositional idiom.Brown, Wandering, 22. While the suite could be simply a selection of excerpts from a larger composition, as Tchaikovsky would later do with his Nutcracker Suite, it had historically been an independent form in itself. This was most notably the case with the Baroque suites that Johann Sebastian Bach composed for orchestra, keyboard and other instruments. These suites were made up mainly of dances of the time, such as allemandes, courantes, Sarabandes and gigues.Brown, Man and Music, 191. Few of Tchaikovsky's compositions are as far removed from the idea of the composer as musical confessor as his orchestral suites would become, yet they would remain entirely true to the pre-Romantic ideal he wished to summon. They were an outgrowth of a trend beginning in Germany following the rediscovering of Bach's orchestral suites, and he valued the genre for formal freedom as well as its unrestricted musical fantasy.Maes, 155. They would give the composer free rein to his penchant for short genre pieces and orchestration. Johannes Brahms would happily find a similar outlet in his serenades, providing him with a medium in which to compose pure orchestral music more relaxed than had previously been possible in the post-Beethoven symphony.Warrack, 161. Tchaikovsky's First Suite would be rooted in the world of the ballet divertissement. To ensure that the piece did not come across as overtly light or frivolous in tone, the composer afforded himself some highmindedness with the opening introduction and fugue. While Tchaikovsky had previously written extended fugato sections, he had written only one full-blown fugue in his compositions since leaving the St. Petersburg Conservatory, in his Op. 21 piano pieces. In addition, Tchaikovsky had to ensure that while the piece presented a wide range of styles and moods, it would add up to a coherent, satisfying experience. This caused him some difficulty as the piece's length rose to become the same as the Fourth Symphony and delayed its completion by a year.Brown, Man and Music, 190-191. Composition According to an August 1878 letter to von Meck, Tchaikovsky originally planned the suite to be in five movements: #Introduzione e fuga #Scherzo #Andante melanconico #Intermezzo: March of the Liliputians #Rondo: Dance of the Giants The scherzo was the germ for the whole composition; it was after plunging headlong into writing it that \\"there arose in my head an array of orchestral pieces which would generate a Suite in the manner of Lachner.\\".Quoted in Yoffe, 4. (Franz Lachner was a well-known and prolific composer in his day (1803–1890), though he is not now considered a major composer. His work was influenced by Ludwig van Beethoven and his friend Franz Schubert.) Complications arose when, once in Florence, Italy and anxious to continue the suite, Tchaikovsky realized the manuscripts for the three movements he had already finished were in his luggage, which had not arrived. He composed the final two movements he had planned while awaiting the luggage. The manuscripts were not among the luggage and were never found. Tchaikovsky completed the suite in April 1879.Yoffe, 4. Complicating matters was that, in August 1879, after P. Jurgenson had already started engraving the printing plates for the suite, Tchaikovsky realized all the movements were in duple meter—in other words, two beats per measure. He quickly penned a Divertimento in triple meter, which he called a minuet but is actually a waltz, to break up this potential metric monotony. Tchaikovsky suggested replacing the March with the Divertimento. Jurgenson liked the March and suggested letting the suite expand to six movements. Six, to Tchaikovsky, was one movement too many. He suggested that Sergei Taneyev be asked his opinion of the March. If Taneyev thought it worthwhile, then Tchaikovsky wanted to drop the Andante and reorder the movements as Introduction and Fugue, Divertimento, Scherzo, March, Gavotte. The Andante's case was then pleaded to the composer. By the time Rubinstein conducted the premiere, the order of the six movements was the one finally established.Brown, Wandering, 20-21. Reception Keeping the March may have actually been a prudent move on Jurgenson's part—one which the publisher may have relished as he reported the First Suite's success at its premiere. Tchaikovsky had been in Rome and could not attend. Jurgenson wrote, \\"The first movement went off without fervent expressions of delight. The second evidently pleased. The Andante pleased very much, but the March drew applause which wouldn't stop until it was repeated. The Scherzo was very well received. The Gavotte found the audience by now fatigued and bursting to get away.\\"Quoted in Brown, Wandering, 21. The suite's St. Petersburg premiere followed on April 6, 1880. It was enthusiastically received and the March again was the most successful movement. The March, in fact, would frequently become played separately because of its popularity.Brown, Wandering, 21. When Claude Debussy was employed as a tutor to Nadezhda von Meck's children, he and she would play 4-hand piano arrangements of the Symphony No. 4 and the Suite No. 1. She wrote to Tchaikovsky that \\"he is in raptures over your music\\", and about the Suite No. 1 specifically, \\"He was in utter ecstasy over the fugue, expressing himself thus: Among modern fugues I've never seen anything so beautiful. Massenet himself could never do anything like it\\".Poznansky, p. 374 Selected recordings * Antal Doráti conducting the New Philharmonia Orchestra * Neeme Järvi conducting the Detroit Symphony Orchestra * Dmitri Mitropoulos conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (one movement cut) * Stefan Sanderling conducting the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra Bibliography * Brown, David, Tchaikovsky: The Years of Wandering (New York: W.W.

Designed by GGN (Gustafson Guthrie Nichol), Piet Oudolf, and Robert Israel, it opened on July 16, 2004. The garden is a combination of perennials, bulbs, grasses, shrubs and trees. It is the featured nature component of the world's largest green roof. The garden cost $13.2 million and has a $10 million endowment for maintenance and upkeep. It was named after Ann Lurie, who donated the $10 million endowment. For visitors, the garden features guided walks, lectures, interactive demonstrations, family festivals and picnics. The Garden is composed of two \\"plates\\" protected on two sides by large hedges. The dark plate depicts Chicago's history by presenting shade-loving plant material. The dark plate has a combination of trees that will provide a shade canopy for these plants when they fill in. The light plate, which includes no trees, represents the city's future with sun-loving perennials that thrive in the heat and the sun. General information Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park has been Chicago's front yard since the mid 19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Today, Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. Today, there is truly a rooftop garden on top of the Millennium Park parking garage, which is itself above railroad tracks. In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated,Macaluso, pp. 12–13 the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city's first lots. Foresighted citizens, who wanted the lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph Street and Park Row (11th Street) \\"Public Ground--A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever.\\"Gilfoyle, pp. 3-4 Grant Park has been \\"forever open, clear and free\\" since, protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings. Millennium Park with Lurie Garden beyond the Jay Pritzker Pavilion In 1839, United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue \\"Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings\\". Aaron Montgomery Ward, who is known both as the inventor of mail order and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones.Macaluso, pp. 23–25 In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held easements on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements.City of Chicago v. A Montgomery Ward, 169 Ill. 392 (1897) In 1909, when he sought to prevent the construction of the Field Museum of Natural History in the center of the park, the courts affirmed his arguments.Gilfoyle, p. 16E. R. Bliss v. A. Montgomery Ward, 198 Ill. 104; A. Montgomery Ward v. Field Museum of Natural History, 241 Ill. 496 (1909); and South Park Commissioners v. Ward & Co., 248 Ill. 299 As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park and there are no tall buildings in the park blocking the sun for large parts of the day. The Lurie garden constantly depicts the dynamics of nature, but it is most colorful from June through the autumn. It is not a botanical garden with a scientific purpose and is instead a public garden. Thus, it does not use a plant labeling system. The plant life of the garden consists entirely of perennials. It does not now nor does it intend to incorporate annuals, which rarely survive Chicago winters. Approximately 60% of the plant life in the light and dark plates are plants that are native to Illinois. It is located across the street from the Art Institute of Chicago's new Modern Wing, and within the park it is south of Jay Pritzker Pavilion, east of the South Chase Promenade and Southwest Exelon Pavilion as well as the future site of the Nichols Bridgeway, west of the Southeast Exelon Pavilion, southwest of the BP Pedestrian Bridge. Culture The garden was an essential element of the park, as the motto of Chicago is Urbs in Horto, which is a Latin phrase meaning City in a Garden. The Garden also pays tribute to Carl Sandburg's moniker of Chicago as the \\"City of Big Shoulders\\" with a \\"shoulder\\" hedge that protects the perennial garden and encloses the park on two sides. It keeps the garden from being trampled by crowds exiting events at the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion. The \\"shoulder\\" hedge, which serves as the northern edge of the garden, also fills the space next to the void of the great lawn of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion. These hedges use a metal armature, to prefigure the mature hedge. The shoulder hedge is an evolving hedge screen of deciduous Fagus (beech) and Carpinus (hornbeam) and evergreen Thuja (arborvitae, also known as redcedars) that will eventually (over the course of approximately ten years) branch horizontally to fill the permanent armature frame and create a solid hedge. The garden was one of the gardens depicted in the 2006 In Search of Paradise: Great Gardens of the World exhibition that was shown from May 12 – October 22, 2006 in the Boeing Galleries and that was later shown in the Chicago Botanic Garden. The Chicago Botanic Garden developed the exhibition that included 65 photomurals of gardens from 21 countries using photographs that were less than five years old. Design Seattle-based landscape architecture firm GGN and Israel, a renowned lighting and set designer, determined the thematic concepts such as the placement of paths and the shapes of perennial beds. Oudolf, a Dutch perennial plantsman, designed the flower beds which contain 26,000 perennial plants in 250 varieties native to the prairie. The garden is designed with four primary components: the shoulder hedge, the light plate, the dark plate and the seam boardwalk. The shoulder hedge frames the garden's north and west sides, and the hedge and armature help to protect the perennials from heavy pedestrian traffic. The armature also provides a permanent pruning guide. In addition to the Carl Sandburg symbolism, the western hedge also forms a topiary referring to greek mythology. Lurie Garden is bisected by a diagonal boardwalk, which represents the natural Lake Michigan seawall that still bisects Grant Park. The boardwalk divides the garden into two plates, one of which contains muted colors, the other bright colors, while paralleling the line of the old Illinois Central Railroad retaining wall. The dark plate represents the early landscape history of the site, while the light plate represents the landscape of the future. The diagonal plate-dividing seam boardwalk serves as a demarcation between two eras of Chicago's landscape development. It also serves as a reminder of the time when Chicago placed boards over the marshland for pedestrians. West shoulder hedge and armature The boardwalk has a wide step on one side. The step, which provides seating, leads down to a wide canal, which runs between this step and a limestone wall. The limestone supports the plant beds of the dark plate. The water is invigorated with jets, and visitors are allowed to sit and dangle their feet in the water. It traces the angle of a historic subterranean seawall that remains beneath the site and used to be the boundary between the marshy Lake Michigan shoreline and the city. The boardwalk also crosses over stepped pools that expose a wide seam of water. The garden initially had a hardwood footbridge that passes over the shallow water in the canal, and that divides the garden diagonally. However, stories in the sixth year of the garden described steel bridges. The entire garden slopes downward to present itself for the new Renzo Piano Modern Wing addition to the Art Institute of Chicago Building. At the foot of the canal opposite the Building the water ends in a pool. Israel's lighting accents the hedges, and pathways are lit by in-ground lighting fixtures. There were complaints that the construction of the Nichols Bridgeway clutters the picturesque view of Lurie Gardens and in so doing diminishes its prairie aspect. Materials The garden is a sustainable design built on lightweight geofoam under the soil. All curbing, stone stairways, stair landings, wall coping, and wall cladding in the interior of the Garden use midwestern limestone. The garden uses granite for paving and wall veneer. Where it is exposed, the granite surfaces have a flamed finish. The boardwalk and wood benches in the Garden are fabricated from FSC-certified Ipe. The garden primarily uses patinized Naval Brass (all metal plates in the Seam), patinized architectural bronze (all handrails), and powdercoated steel (the armature). Wildlife features The seasonal highlights are as follows: Spring highlights include - Star of Persia, Arkansas Blue Star, Wild White Indigo, Quamash, Shooting Star, Prairie Smoke, Virginia Bluebells, Herbaceous Peony, Phlomis, Meadow Sage, Burnet, and Tulip; Summer highlights include - Giant Hyssop, Ornamental Onion, Butterfly Weed, Purple Lance Astilbe, Calamint, Rusty Foxglove, Pale Coneflower, Daylily, White Blazing Star, Bee Balm, Oregano, and Culver's Root; Fall/Winter highlights include - Japanese Anemone, White Wood Aster, Northern Sea Oats, Tennessee Coneflower, Purple Love Grass, Rattlesnake Master, Bottle Gentian, Common Eulalia Grass, Red Switch Grass, Little Bluestem, Prairie Dropseed, and Toad Lily. The garden features dozens of types of perennials and bulbs. The garden features both ornamental and prairie grasses. It includes evergreen and deciduous shrubs. Its trees serve as its foundation. The wide variety of plant life has lured dozens of cottontail rabbits to the Garden and the surrounding park. The garden uses no synthetic pesticides. 60,000 and 42,000 bulbs were handplanted in 2006 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, 20,000 additional bulbs were planted, bringing the total to 120,000 and extending the flowering season earlier. The garden includes 35,000 perennials in 240 varieties and 5,200 \\"woody\\" plants in 14 varieties. The dark plate's perennials include ferns, angelicas and other broad-leaved species, with a scattering of trees sprouting out of the flower beds. These plants thrive with shade from trees. The lush plants of this plate were selected by Oudolf as a tribute to Chicago's marshy beginnings. It is described as a thick wetland whose designers have described as \\"wild, naughty and hidden.\\" The shoulder hedges in 2004 The light plate is dominated by prairie plants: grasses, coneflowers, prairie-smoke and no trees. These plants thrive in direct sunlight. This plate unites lighter native plants with imported specimens. It is described as a fine-textured upland whose designers have described as \\"clean, noble and prominent\\". At the time of the 2004 opening of the Garden, the perennials were expected to need a year or two to mature and the hedges were expected to need another five to ten years to fill out. Another Tribune critic, Beth Botts, noted that the historical symbolism of the plantings is a future pleasure to be anticipated. However, she noted that it would be many years before the rosebud trees to the east could provide a pleasant shade. By the July/August 2010 issue of Garden Design, the garden was described as a garden in maturity worth revisiting. Several animal species have been sighted in the garden. 27 species of birds have been identified in the park and its garden. Butterflies and bees have are among the wildlife that visit the garden. Visitor programming In 2008, the garden hosted four million visitors from 21 countries. In its first few years, it has had over two dozen adult programs attended by 1,800 people each year and over three dozen family programs attended by 5,000 people per year. The garden participated in an \\"Ask Me\\" program in 2009, during which 12 volunteers logged 192 hours answering questions from 1,094 guests from 35 states and 20 countries as well as a series of 2009 Sunday Garden Tours in which 24 people volunteered 391 hours to guide 2,027 guests from 45 states and 26 countries through the garden. During 2009, eight volunteers spent 383 hours gardening. The garden has two staff members and four volunteers on hand to answer questions on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The garden is open from Memorial Day through Labor Day from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekends. Critical review Video of Lurie Garden Chicago Tribune Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin, rated the garden as three stars, but projected it to be a four star venue once mature. He praised the light plate especially for its vibrant composition and undulating garden as a fitting contrast to the historic Chicago skyline. He also praised the symbolism of the seam for its uniqueness. He considers the garden a testament to the value of urban planning of public spaces. Botts noted that the reward of a design awaiting maturity is in enjoying the maturation. Awards The garden is the result of an invited international competition that occurred from August to October 2000. Following the contest the garden was commissioned in October 2000 and completed in June 2004. Among the entrants in the competition were Louis Benech, Dan Kiley, George Hargreaves, Jeffrey Mendoza and Michael Van Valkenburgh. The garden has won numerous awards: Best Public Space Award by Travel + Leisure, 2005; Intensive Industrial Award by Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, 2005; Award of Honor by WASLA Professional Awards, 2005; Institute Honor Awards for Regional & Urban Design, American Institute of Architects, 2006 (Millennium Park); and Award of Excellence, American Society of Landscape Architects Professional Awards, 2008. Green Roofs for Healthy Cities considers the park to be the largest green roof in the world as it covers a structural deck supported by two reinforced concrete cast-in-place garages and steel structures that span the space above Illinois Central Railroad tracks.

History The 3.5-acre site was previously the location of a nightclub, which opened in 1978 as Jubilation, became the Shark Club in 1988, and closed in 1996. By 1997, Grand Casinos had obtained an option to purchase the land, along with several adjacent parcels, which it hoped to develop as a major casino. In 2000, Lakes Gaming, which had spun off from Grand Casinos in 1998, announced plans for a $700-million non-gaming hotel project on the land, in a joint venture with local developer Brett Torino. Lakes sold out its interest in the project to Torino in 2001, but retained ownership of the Shark Club parcel, revealing that it was in discussions with an undisclosed partner to build a timeshare project on the site. Diamond Resorts International, owner of the neighboring Polo Towers timeshare complex, announced plans for The Chateau in February 2002. A later report in August 2002 described the project as a joint venture between Diamond Resorts and Lakes Entertainment (the new name of Lakes Gaming). Marriott Vacation Club bought out Lakes's interest in the project, including ownership of the land, in June 2003. Construction of the tower proceeded in phases. The first wing opened in October 2005. The third wing began construction in 2012.

Career A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Pennel started pole vaulting at his father's farm with an old television aerial. At Coral Gables High School, where he was a member of both the gymnastics and the track and field teams, he cleared 11 feet 3 inches (3.43 m) at the age of 15. Improving steadily under the coaching of Ed Injachock he improved to 3.80 m in 1958 and in 1959 he ranked 8th among American schoolboys with 4.14 m (13 ft 7 in).

Off a dirt runway and using a borrowed aluminium pole he cleared 4.58 m, just a quarter of an inch over fifteen feet and a national record for a college freshman.

He cleared 4.47 m (14 ft 8 in) in 1961 before switching to the new fiberglass poles and within a very few months began to reap the benefits; on the last day of the year he went over fifteen feet again (4.61 m) in New Orleans and improved to 4.67 m (15 ft. 4\\") indoors on January 12, 1962, but again failed to repeat his form outdoors that season. Early in 1963, by which time he is being coached by Bob Groseclose,Athletics Weekly, (AW17.36.15) he cleared sixteen feet in training but was turned down by meeting promoters on the grounds that he wasn't good enough. He travelled to Toronto to prove himself and in his only major indoor meet of the season cleared 4.75 m (15 ft. 7¼\\") for second place. Outdoors, he started off with 4.80 m (15 ft. 9\\") and the following week, on March 23, 1963, the man who was not good enough for an indoor meet exceeded the existing world record of 4.94 m with a 4.95 m (16 ft 3\\") jump at home in Memphis. He did it again the following month with a 4.98 m jump, but neither mark was ratified as a world record. Nineteen-year-old Brian Sternberg had the honor of being the world's first 5.00-metre vaulter in Philadelphia on April 27, 1963. Interviewed afterwards he said, \\"I don't expect the record to stand a long time\\", and he was right. Just four days later Pennel surpassed the record with a 5.05 m (16 ft 6¾\\") leap at Monroe, Louisiana, but, again, his mark was not ratified. Again at Monroe on May 4, 4.88 m (16 ft 0 in) was enough for first place but on the same day at San Jose American Jeff Chase vaulted 8.74 m (28 ft 8 in); not to worry, they were vaulting for distance, not height.Athletics Weekly, (AW17.22.12) The following weekend decathlete and future world record holder Yang Chuan-kwang became the first man to vault sixteen feet and lose, being beaten by Ron Morris at a meet in Fresno, California.Athletics Weekly, (AW17.22.11) By the end of the month of May there were no less than ten men worldwide over sixteen feet and eight of them were Americans; the other \\"foreigner\\" was the Finnish athlete Pentti Nikula, who held the world record Sternberg had broken in April,Athletics Weekly, (AW17.23.11) and Sternberg had equalled Pennel's \\"world record\\" at the Modesto relays on May 25. But this was not ratified as a world record. However, Sternberg got his second and final world record at Compton, California on June 7, clearing 5.08 m (16 ft 8 in), and found 5.00 m (16 ft. 4¾\\") enough to take the NCAA at Albuquerque the following week with Cruz, Cramer, Hansen and Watson in that order all on 4.82 m (15 ft. 9¾\\"),Athletics Weekly, (AW17.26.17) and strangely he also found 4.98 m (16 ft. 4\\") sufficient to take the AAU title in St. Louis a week later with Pennel back in sixth place on 4.80m (15 ft. 9\\"),Athletics Weekly, (AW17.27.18) (the same weekend that Bob Hayes ran the first legal 9.1 s 100 yards). Pennel in 1963 Despite his poor showing in recent weeks Pennel was selected to join the squad that toured Europe that summer, so on Friday July 13 while Ron Hill was busy breaking the Commonwealth 10,000 m record Pennel was at the White City Stadium in London qualifying for the AAA Championships, which he did with ease. The following day he came back for what Mel Watman called a \\"superlative display\\" of pole vaulting. Entering the competition at 4.46 m (14 ft. 7½\\") he cleared first time but needed three tries at 4.57 m (15 ft. 0\\"), clearing on the third try by \\"at least eighteen inches\\". Further attempts were hampered by the three-mile track race being in progress so he had to time his run-up, which started on the track, quite carefully. He cleared both 4.72 m (15 ft. 6\\") and 4.87 m (16 ft. 0\\") first time. His first two attempts at the new world record 5.10m (16 ft. 8¾\\") were aborted as he mis-timed his approach, but on the third try he planted firmly and sailed over. But, again, the mark was not ratified as a world record. He had three attempts at 5.19 m (17ft. 0¼\\") but they didn't come to anything.Athletics Weekly, (AW17.29.24) By now there were thirteen men over sixteen feetAthletics Weekly, (AW17.26.11) and the race was to be the first over seventeen feet.

He improved the world record, this time clearing 5.13 m (16 ft. 10\\") and a few days later on August 25 Morris, still in Finland but now at Mikkeli, moved to third on the all-time list with a vault 5.02 m (16 ft. 5¾\\"). The previous day, however, at Coral Gables, Florida, using a pole he had borrowed from fellow vaulter Fred Hansen back in March, Pennel had cleared 5.20 m (17ft. 0¾\\") at his first attempt and just eighteen months after the world's first 16-foot vault he became the world's first 17-foot pole vaulter.Athletics Weekly, (AW17.35.17) The world would have to wait seven years before anyone cleared 18 feet (5.48 m). Pennel receiving the James E. Sullivan Award Following those amazing performances, Pennel was asked to appear on the popular television game show, To Tell The Truth. On the September 9, 1963 episode, Pennel scored against the celebrity panel (Tom Poston, Peggy Cass, Earl Wrightson, and Kitty Carlisle), and immediately donated his winnings to the Brian Sternberg Hospital Fund. On February 27, 1965 he appeared on the popular panel show \\"Whats My Line\\" not as an athlete, but rather as a wine salesman, a career he had just taken up. He nearly stumped the panel, but Bennett Cerf guessed his line at the last moment. Sternberg, a University of Washington pole vaulter, was injured during practice in an accident that left him a quadriplegic. In April 1964, Pennel was awarded the 1963 Sullivan Award as the nation's top amateur athlete, and was favored to capture the gold medal at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. Unfortunately, he suffered a back injury six weeks before the Games and finished 11th, with a height of 15–5. American teammate Fred Hansen set an Olympic record with a vault of 16–8¾ and won the gold medal.Athletics at the 1964 Tokyo Summer Games: Men's Pole Vault . sports-reference.com In 1967, Pennel was featured as Bachelor Number Three on the popular television show, The Dating Game, episode 67 008, during the second set.

Pennel was chosen as the favorite by the Bachelorette, who was a gymnast. https://youtu.be/Gcaa0Qw7CmM?t=793 After the Olympics, Hansen vaulted an unratified 17–3¾, and Bob Seagren set the mark at 17–5 two years later. Following Seagren's performance, Pennel reclaimed the record at 17–6 (5.34 m) in 1966, his third ratified world record. Pennel was favored to win an Olympic gold in Mexico City in 1968, but he finished fifth. He cleared 5.40 m on his second attempt, and this would be enough for a medal, but his pole passed under the bar, which was illegal at the time; the rule was abolished next year.Athletics at the 1968 Ciudad de México Summer Games: Men's Pole Vault . sports-reference.com In 1969, Pennel set his fourth and final world record, 17–10¼ (5.44 m).

It was registered in 2011 as the first private charitable fundraising organization in China. Its headquarters is in Shenzhen, with offices in Beijing and Shanghai. The foundation's motto is \\"Charity by All, Doing What I Can\\" (). As of April 2013, the board of directors consisted of 11 members, in alphabetical order: Feng Lun (), Jet Li (), Liu Chuanzhi (), Pony Ma (), Ma Weihua (), Jack Ma (), Niu Gensheng (), Wang Shi (), Yang Peng (), Zhou Qiren () and Zhou Weiyan ().  History  Origin The One Foundation was founded by Chinese Red Cross ambassador Jet Li on April 19, 2007 as the Red Cross Society of China Jet Li One Foundation Project () which operated under the Red Cross Society of China. Li stopped his film work throughout 2008 to devote all of his time to developing the foundation. In a Newsweek article, Li cited his personal experience with the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami as a source of inspiration for starting the foundation. At the time, Li, his wife, and two of youngest daughters were vacationing in the Maldives when the tsunami struck. His youngest 1-year-old daughter and her nanny were briefly swept away before being rescued by bystanders.http://www.newsweek.com/jet-li-explains-why-he-started- foundation-89273 In October 2008, the One Foundation registered in Shanghai as a private equity fund under the name Shanghai Jet Li One Foundation Charity Fund (). Through pilot regulations on public fundraising enacted in the Shenzhen special economic zone, the One Foundation was able to register as an independent public fundraising foundation on December 3, 2010, thus ending its affiliation with the government-run Chinese Red Cross and becoming the first Chinese NGO not affiliated with the government or a government-sponsored organization. Commentators regarded this development as a \\"breakthrough\\" in the development of Chinese NGOs.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/12/c_13687548.htm Institutional funding for the Shenzhen-based organization came from the Shanghai Jet Li One Foundation Charity Fund, Lao Niu Foundation (), Tencent Charitable Foundation (), Vantone Foundation () and Vanke Foundation (). Each founding organization donated 10 million RMB for a total of 50 million RMB start-up capital.  Chinese Red Cross Affiliation  Before its establishment in Shenzhen as an independent foundation, the One Foundation was an affiliate of the Chinese Red Cross, with its funds managed by the latter. Li cited the lack of independence as a motivating factor for the One Foundation to end its cooperation with the Chinese Red Cross in 2010. Following the Chinese Red Cross' Guo Meimei scandal in 2011, the One Foundation tried to distance itself from its former connection with the organization. After the 2013 Lushan earthquake, web users in China discovered that the English section of the One Foundation website still claimed there was a direct link to the Red Cross, and that donations to One Foundation would be \\"deposited directly into an account held by the Red Cross Society of China, earmarked for use by the One Foundation.\\" One Foundation promptly took down the English site and issued a statement that the information was outdated, representing the situation before December 3, 2010, and that only information on the site in Chinese should be considered correct. Director of Operations Rob Hemsley successfully took charge of limiting fallout from the Guo Meimei connection.  Volunteers  Volunteers for the foundation pledge themselves to donating a set amount each year and/or committing one hour of their time each month to the community through their line of work or other form of volunteer work. Volunteers are classified into four groups: Academic, Individual, Student, and Organizational. Notable volunteers include Yao Ming, Andy Lau, Michelle Yeoh, Kang Xiaoguang, Jack Ma, Xu Yongguang, Zhuang Ailing, Li Bingbing, and students of Beijing Normal University.  Donations  The One Foundation promotes donations under the slogan \\"1 person + 1 dollar + 1 month = 1 big family,\\" with the goal of pooling together individual donations to encourage participation in philanthropy and charity, particularly in China and Asia.

The objective of the eavesdropping was to find out who had leaked confidential information about planned lay-offs and acquisitions to the media in 2005 and 2006. According to German law half the members of the advisory board of large publicly listed companies have to be representatives of the employees.

He was a Liberal member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 2005 to 2017. First elected to the seat of Roe at the 2005 election, he transferred to Eyre at the 2008 election following the abolition of his former seat. Jacobs was born in Benalla, Victoria. His family moved to Western Australia in 1955 and settled on a farm at Lort River west of Esperance. Educated at Esperance Primary School then Esperance Senior High School, Jacobs attended the University of Western Australia from 1969 to 1975 and was awarded his Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery. Jacobs is married to Kathryn and they have five children; Jesse, Daniel, Aubrey, Lucy and Julian. He is a physician by profession and lives in Esperance. Jacobs had contested Roe in 1989 but it was not until the sitting Nationals member Ross Ainsworth left in 2005 that Jacobs again contested the seat and beat new Nationals candidate Jane McMeikan with a massive swing of 27%. Jacobs served as the Opposition spokesperson for Drug Abuse Strategy from 2005 to 2008, the Shadow Minister for Environment & Climate Change and the Shadow Minister for Goldfields-Esperance in 2008. He also served as the opposition whip from 2005 to 2006 and again in 2008. In May 2008, Jacobs called for a Liberal parliamentary leadership spill motion against Troy Buswell, which took place on 5 May 2008, but the motion failed and Buswell remained opposition leader. The following month Jacobs supported another unsuccessful spill motion against Buswell, this time led by Anthony Fels MLC. Buswell would eventually be replaced by Colin Barnett. Following the state election in September 2008, where the incumbent Labor government was defeated and the National Party agreed to vote with the Liberal Party in the hung parliament, Jacobs became the Minister for Water and the Minister for Mental Health. He was a member of the Barnett Ministry from 23 September 2008 until 14 December 2010. Jacobs became the member for the revived electorate of Eyre following the introduction of one-vote one-value electoral boundaries and the abolition of Roe. He was narrowly re-elected as the member for Eyre during the 2013 state election, fending off a strong challenge from the Nationals. Jacobs has called for 'more balance' in terms of Royalties for Regions spending across regional Western Australia but has defended the program against calls for it to be scrapped. He has also campaigned for more support to be extended to Western Australian farmers facing financial hardship, warning: \\"If we do not support our farmers we will see more foreign buy-up of land particularly by Chinese interests.\\". Eyre was abolished ahead of the 2017 state election, and was partly replaced by a revived Roe. Jacobs attempted to transfer back to Roe. However, the new seat was a comfortably safe WA Nationals seat with a majority of 16 percent, a disadvantage Jacobs was unable to overcome despite his 12 years in the legislature. He lost to WA National candidate Peter Rundle, taking only 35.6 percent of the two-party vote.

Social media measurement, social media monitoring or social listening is a way of computing popularity of a brand or company by extracting information from social media channels, such as blogs, wikis, news sites, micro-blogs such as Twitter, social networking sites, video/photo sharing websites, forums, message boards and user-generated content from time to time. In other words, this is the way to caliber success of social media marketing strategies used by a company or a brand. It is also used by companies to gauge current trends in the industry. The process first gathers data from different websites and then performs analysis based on different metrics like time spent on the page, click through rate, content share, comments, text analytics to identify positive or negative emotions about the brand. Social Media Measurement process starts with defining a goal that needs to be achieved and defining the expected outcome of the process. The expected outcome varies per the goal and is usually measured by a variety of metrics. This is followed by defining possible social strategies to be used to achieve the goal. Then the next step is designing strategies to be used and setting up configuration tools that ease the process of collecting the data. In the next step, strategies and tools are deployed in real-time. This step involves conducting Quality Assurance tests of the methods deployed to collect the data. And in the final step, data collected from the system is analyzed and if the need arises, it is refined on the run time to enhance the methodologies used. The last step ensures that the result obtained is more aligned with the goal defined in the first step.  Data Acquisition  Acquiring data from social media is in demand of an exploring the user participation and population with the purpose of retrieving and collecting so many kinds of data(ex: comments, downloads etc.). There are several prevalent techniques to acquire data such as Network traffic analysis, Ad-hoc application and Crawling Network Traffic Analysis \\\\- Network traffic analysis is the process of capturing network traffic and observing it closely to determine what is happening in the network. It is primarily done to improve the performance, security and other general management of the network. However concerned about the potential tort of privacy on the Internet, network traffic analysis is always restricted by the government. Furthermore, high-speed links are not adaptable to traffic analysis because of the possible overload problem according to the packet sniffing mechanism Ad-hoc Application \\\\- Ad-hoc application is a kind of application that provides services and games to social network users by developing the APIs offered by social network companies (Facebook Developer Platform). The infrastructure of Ad-hoc application allows the user to interact with the interface layer instead of the application servers. The API provides a path for application to access information after the user login. Moreover, the size of the data set collected vary with the popularity of the social media platform i.e. social media platforms having high number of users will have more data than platforms having less user base. Scraping is a process in which the APIs collect online data from social media. The data collected from Scraping is in raw format. However, having access to these type of data is a bit difficult because of its commercial value. Crawling \\\\- Crawling is a process in which a web crawler creates indexes of all the words in a web-page, stores them, then follows all the hyperlinks and indexes on that page and again stores them. It is the most popular technique for data acquisition and is also well known for its easy operation based on prevalent Object-Orientated Programming Language (Java or Python etc.). And most important, social network companies (YouTube, Flicker, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) are friendly to crawling techniques by providing public APIs Applications  For branding  Monitoring social media allows researchers to find insights into a brand's overall visibility on social media, to measure the impact of campaigns, to identify opportunities for engagement, to assess competitor activity and share of voice, and to detect impending crises. It can also provide valuable information about emerging trends and what consumers and clients think about specific topics, brands or products. This is the work of a cross-section of groups that include market researchers, PR staff, marketing teams, social-engagement, and community staff, agencies and sales teams. Several different providers have developed tools to facilitate the monitoring of a variety of social media channels - from blogging to internet video to internet forums. This allows companies to track what consumers say about their brands and actions. Companies can then react to these conversations and interact with consumers through social media platforms.  In government  Apart from commercial applications, social media monitoring has become a pervasive technique applied by public organizations and governments. Monitoring is a tradition within the public sector, and social-media monitoring provides a real-time approach to detecting and responding to social developments. Governments have come to realize the need for strategies to cope with surprises from the rapid expansion of public issues. Sobkowicz introduced a framework with three blocks of social-media opinion tracking, simulating and forecasting. It includes: # real-time detection of emotions, topics and opinions # information-flow modelling and agent-based simulation # modeling of opinion networks Bekkers introduced the application of social media monitoring in the Netherlands. Public organizations in the Netherlands (such as the Tax Agency and the Education Ministry) have started to use social media monitoring to obtain better insights into the sentiments of target groups. On the one hand, the public sector will be enabled to provide timely and efficient answers to the public by using social media monitoring techniques, but on the other hand, they also have to deal with concerns about ethical issues such as transparency and privacy. Quantifying social media Social media management software (SMMS) is an application program or software that facilitates an organisation's ability to successfully engage in social media across different communication channels. SMMS is used to monitor inbound and outbound conversations, support customer interaction, audit or document social marketing initiatives and evaluate the usefulness of a social media presence. It can be difficult to measure all social media conversations. Due to privacy settings and other issues, not all social media conversations can be found and reported by monitoring tools. However, whilst social media monitoring cannot give absolute figures, it can be extremely useful for identifying trends and for benchmarking, in addition to the uses mentioned above. These findings can, in turn, influence and shape future business decisions. In order to access social media data (posts, Tweets, and meta-data) and to analyze and monitor social media, many companies use software technologies built for business. Location-based Most social media networks allow users to add a location to their posts (reference all of our feeds).

'About-the-location' services can be defined as services which are referring to a particular location but the content is not necessarily created in this particular physical place.\\" The added information available from geotagged (link to Geotagging article) posts means that they can be displayed on a map. This means that a location can be used as the start of a social media search rather than a keyword or hashtag. This has major implications for disaster relief, event monitoring, safety and security professionals since a large portion of their job is related to tracking and monitoring specific locations. Technologies used Various monitoring platforms use different technologies for social media monitoring and measurement. These technology providers may connect to the API provided by social platforms that are created for 3rd party developers to develop their own applications and services that access data. Facebook's Graph API is one such API that social media monitoring solution products would connect to pull data from. Technology companies may also get social data from a data reseller, such as DataSift or Gnip, which was acquired by Twitter. Some social media monitoring and analytics companies use calls to data providers each time an end-user develops a query. Others will also store and index social posts to offer historical data to their customers. Additional monitoring companies use crawlers and spidering technology to find keyword references. (See also: Semantic analysis, Natural language processing.) Basic implementation involves curating data from social media on a large scale and analyzing the results to make sense out of it.

At that time there was no government funding for scientific research, and the money came from medical foundations interested in evaluating the possible uses of neutron beams for cancer treatment and for producing radio- isotopes for medical research. In the fall of 1940 he was hired by Lawrence to help on adapting and using the 37-inch cyclotron to separate isotopes of uranium for the atomic bomb project. Later, he went to Los Alamos, where the first bombs were designed and built, and where he remained for the rest of the war. With the end of the war he returned to Berkeley to complete the final year of his degree program, then went on to the University of Minnesota as a post doctoral fellow.

He is the Lexis Nexis Ohio Eminent Scholar for Advanced Data Management and Analysis. Up to October 2018, Sheth's work had been cited by over 41,000 publications. He has an h-index of 100, which puts him among the top 100 computer scientists with the highest h-index. Prior to founding the Kno.e.sis Center, he served as the director of the Large Scale Distributed Information Systems Lab at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. Education Sheth received his bachelor's in engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in computer science in 1981. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the Ohio State University in 1983 and 1985, respectively. Research Semantic interoperability/integration and semantic web Sheth has investigated, demonstrated, and advocated for the comprehensive use of metadata. He explored syntactical, structural, and semantic metadata; recently, he has pioneered ontology-driven approaches to metadata extraction and semantic analytics. He was among the first researchers to utilize description logic-based ontologies for schema and information integration (a decade before W3C adopted a DL-based ontology representation standard), and he was the first to deliver a keynote about Semantic Web applications in search. His work on multi-ontology query processing includes the most cited paper on the topic (over 930 citations). In 1996, he introduced the powerful concept of Metadata Reference Link (MREF) for associating metadata to hypertext that links documents on the Web and described an RDF- based realization in 1998, before RDF was adopted as a W3C recommendation. Part of his recent work has focussed on information extraction from text to generate semantic metadata in the form of RDF. In his work, semantic metadata extracted from biological text is made up of complex knowledge structures (complex entities and relationships) that reflect complex interactions in biomedical knowledge. Sheth proposed a realization of Vannevar Bush's MEMEX vision as the Relationship Web, based on the semantic metadata extracted from text. Sheth and his co-inventors were awarded the first known patent for commercial Semantic Web applications in browsing, searching, profiling, personalization, and advertising, which led to his founding of the first Semantic Search company, Taalee. In 1992, he gave an influential keynote titled \\"So far (schematically) yet so near (semantically)\\", which attested to the need for domain-specific semantics, the use of ontological representation for richer semantic modeling/knowledge representation, and the use of context when looking for similarity between objects. His work on using ontologies for information processing encompassed the approach for searching for an ontology- automated reasoning for schema integration, semantic search, other applications, and semantic query processing. The latter involved query transformations using different ontologies for user queries and resources and federated queries—a concept with associated measures and techniques for computing information loss when traversing taxonomic relationships. Workflow management and semantic web services In the early 1990s, he initiated research in the formal modeling, scheduling, and correctness of workflows. His METEOR project demonstrated the value of research with real- world applications; its tools were used in graduate courses in several countries, and its technology was licensed to create a commercial product and was followed up by METEOR-S. He led the research (later joined by IBM) that resulted in the W3C submission of WSDL-S (Semantic Annotation of WSDL), the basis for SAWSDL, a W3C recommendation for adding semantics to WSDL and XML Schema. For both SAWSDL and SA-REST, he provided leadership in the community- based process followed by the W3C. He coauthored a 1995 paper in the Journal of Distributed and Parallel Databases, which is one of the most cited papers in the area of workflow management literature, with more than 2,330 citations, as well as the most cited among over 430 papers published in that journal. His key technical areas of contribution in workflow management include adaptive workflow management, exception handling, authorization and access control, security, optimization, and quality of service. Information integration, database interoperability/integration, and database federations In the 1980s, large organizations wanted to couple multiple autonomous databases to accomplish certain tasks, but how this could be accomplished from a technical perspective wasn't understood. Starting in 1987, Sheth gave a number of tutorials at ICDE, VLDB, SIGMOD, and other major conferences in the area of distributed (federated) data management and developed scientific foundations and architectural principles to address these issues of database interoperability. He developed a clean reference architecture, covered in his most cited paper on federated databases. It provides an architecture consisting of a range of tightly (i.e., global as a view) to loosely coupled (i.e., local as a view) alternatives for dealing with three dimensions: distribution, heterogeneity, and autonomy. Later, he led the development of a schema integration tool in the USA. Sheth analyzed the limitations resulting from the autonomy of the individual databases and worked towards deep integration by developing specification models for interdatabase dependencies, allowing for a limited degree of coupling to ensure global consistency for critical applications. Together with Dimitrios Georgakopoulos and Marek Rusinkiewicz, he developed the ticketing method for concurrency control of global transactions that need to see and preserve a consistent state across multiple databases. This work, which was recognized with a best paper award at the 1991 International Conference on Data Engineering Conference, was awarded a patent and resulted in progress on multidatabase transactions by other researchers. His work continued in the areas of the integration and interoperability of networked databases in enterprises to Web-based database access. He has also helped to characterize metadata and develop the techniques that extract and use metadata for integrated access to a variety of content, ranging from databases to multimedia/multimodal data. Richer relationship identification on linked open data Sheth has been a strong proponent of identifying a richer and broader set of relationships, such as meronomy and causality, on the Semantic Web. His idea of a \\"relationship web\\" is inspired from the vision of memex given by Vannevar Bush. Since the inception of linked data he emphasized the utilization of schema knowledge and the information present on the Web and in linked data for this purpose. These ideas led to a system called BLOOMS for the identification of schema-level relationships between datasets belonging to linked data. Another related system called PLATO allowed for the identification of partonomical relationship between entities on linked data. Semantics and knowledge-empowered information extraction/NLP/ML, search, browsing, and analysis In 1993, he initiated InfoHarness, a system that extracted metadata from diverse content (news, software code, and requirements documents) using a Mozilla browser-based faceted search. This system transitioned into a product by Bellcore in 1995 and was followed by a metadata-based search engine for a personal, electronic program guide and Web-based videos for a cable set-top box. He licensed this technology he developed at the University of Georgia for his company Taalee in the same year that Tim-Berners Lee coined the term Semantic Web. In the first keynote on Semantic Web given anywhere, Sheth presented Taalee's commercial implementation of a semantic search engine, which is covered the patent \\"System and method for creating a semantic web and its applications in browsing, searching, profiling, personalization and advertising\\". This 1999–2001 incarnation of semantic search (as described in the patent document) started with extensive tooling to create an ontology/WorldModel (today's knowledge graph) to design a schema and then automatically extract information (through knowledge extraction agents) and incorporate knowledge from multiple high-quality sources to populate the ontology and keep it fresh. This involves machinery for disambiguation to identify what is new and what has changed. Then the data extraction agents which supported diverse content either pulled (crawled) or pushed (e.g., syndicated news in NewsML), called upon a nine- classifier committee (using bayesian, HMM, and knowledge-based classifiers) to determine the domains of the content, identify the relevant subset of the ontology to use, and perform semantic annotation. \\"Semantic Enhancement Engine: A Modular Document Enhancement Platform for Semantic Applications over Heterogeneous Content\\" is one of the earliest publications demonstrating the unusual effectiveness of knowledge-based classifiers compared with more traditional ML techniques. The third component of the system utilized ontology and metadata (annotation) to support semantic search, browsing, profiling, personalization, and advertising. This system also supported a dynamically- generated \\"Rich Media Reference\\" (a.k.a. Google's Infobox) which not only displayed metadata about the searched entity pulled from the ontology and metabase but also provided what was termed \\"blended semantic browsing and querying\\". He also led efforts in other forms/modality of data, including social and sensor data. He coined the term \\"Semantic Sensor Web\\" and initiated and co-chaired the W3C effort on Semantic Sensor Networking that resulted in a de facto standard. He introduced the concept of semantic perception to reflect the process of converting massive amounts of IoT data into higher level abstractions to support human cognition and perception in decision making, which involves an IntellegO ontology-enabled abductive and deductive reasoning framework for iterative hypothesis refinement and validation. Real-time scalable social media analytics In early 2009 he initiated and framed the issue of social media analysis in a broad set of semantic dimensions he called \\"Spatio-Temporal-Thematic\\" (STT). He emphasised the analysis of social data from the perspective of people, content, sentiment analysis and emotions. This idea led to a system called Twitris, which employs dynamically evolving semantic models produced by the Semantic Web project Doozer for this purpose. Twitris system can identify people's emotions (such as: joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.) from their social media posts by applying machine learning techniques with millions of self-labeled emotion tweets.  Entrepreneurship  Sheth founded Infocosm, Inc. in 1997, which licensed and commercialized the METEOR technology from the research he led at the University of Georgia, resulting in distributed workflow management products, WebWork and ORBWork. He founded Taalee, Inc. in 1999 based on licensing VideoAnywhere technology based on the research he led at the University of Georgia. The first product from Taalee was a semantic search engine. Alt URL Taalee became Voquette after merger in 2002, and then Semagix in 2004. In 2016, Cognovi Labs was founded based on the Twirtis technology resulting from the research he led at the Kno.e.sis Center of the Wright State University. The technology was successfully used to predict Brexit and the US 2016 presidential election.

It was designed and built in the 1920s as a movie palace styled in neoclassical Persian and Moorish architecture. Today it specializes in films produced between 1910 and 1970 and seasonal programs typically include film festivals for various genres, directors, and actors, such as Alfred Hitchcock, Bette Davis, and Cary Grant. The Stanford Theatre frequently accounts for as much as twenty-five percent of all classic film attendance in the United States. The Theatre has a \\"The Mighty Wurlitzer Organ\\" theatre organ made by Rudolph Wurlitzer Company. The organ is played live during intermissions, as well as to accompany silent films.  History  Designed by architects Weeks and Day, the theater was built at a cost of with construction starting in 1924. It had a Leatherbury-Smith orchestral organ installed with pipes ranging in size from a toothpick to a 32-foot pipe providing sounds for stringed instruments, trumpes, flutes, saxophone, clarinet, and various percussion instruments. The Theatre opened on June 9, 1925 with a showing of I'll Show You the Town after a dedication speech and had a capacity of approximately 1500. By the 1960s the Theatre was on hard times, the organ had been removed and the interior was not cleaned to a degree that, \\"many moviegoers flatly refused to enter the place, no matter what was showing.\\" In 1987 after the death of Fred Astaire, David Woodley Packard had a film festival of Astaire's works at the theatre. The two week festival was so successful that his father, Hewlett-Packard co-founder David Packard, agreed with his idea to purchase the aging theatre. It was purchased in 1987 for $7.7 million and restored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation at an additional cost of $6 million for a 1989 grand opening of The Wizard of Oz. Part of the restoration included installing an organ to replace the original which had been sold as parts. The process took 2 years to obtain and restore parts which included the 1926 console from Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the organ's 1928 pipes from Loew's Theatre. The Theatre was renovated in late 2017 with repainting, new carpets, and the seats being restored with new padding and mohair coverings.

Like epibatidine, tebanicline showed potent analgesic activity against neuropathic pain in both animal and human trials, but with far less toxicity than its parent compound. It acts as a partial agonist at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, binding to both the α3β4 and the α4β2 subtypes.

Around 70%-80% of gems mined in Sri Lanka belong to geuda varieties. Because of its semitransparent and milky appearance due to rutile inclusions, these stones have little value as gemstones in their natural state. Geuda was frequently stored in large drums or used to gravel home gardens prior to the 1970s discovery that heat treatment can drastically alter the stone's color.Stephen M Voynick, Yogo: The Great American Sapphire. Mountain Press Publishing Company, Missoula. 1985 Some geuda varieties turn to a blue color after heat treatments. Others turn to red after oxidizing. Kowangu pushparaga turns to yellow sapphire after oxidizing. After heating geuda to roughly 1800 °C, the aluminium oxide lattice-work of the gem is disrupted and cooling greatly improves both color and clarity. Though many stones are destroyed by the heating and cooling process, those that survive are significantly altered and rival naturally blue sapphires in both appearance and price.

He was the son of naturalist Anton Brugmans (1732-1789).The Mineralogical Record, Inc. Brugmans studied philosophy, mathematics and physics at the Universities of Franeker and Groningen, earning his doctorate in 1781. In 1785 he became a professor at Franeker, where he taught classes in physics, astronomy, logic and metaphysics. During the following year, he succeeded David van Royen (1727–1799) as professor of botany at the University of Leiden.New Dutch biographical dictionary. Part 1 (biography). At Leiden, he also served as director of the \\"Hortus Botanicus Leiden\\".History Hortus Botanicus Leiden In 1791, he transferred from the Faculty of Philosophy to that of Medicine, of which, from 1795, included the field of chemistry. Brugmans was very interested in the connection that exists between chemistry and medicine.International Review of the Red Cross; Military Law (biography) In 1794, when Holland became a refuge for retreating English and Hanoverian armies, he, along with physicians and medical students at Leiden, set up emergency hospital services outside the city. He repeated this activity in 1799 (for English and Russian forces north of present-day IJmuiden), and in 1809 (bombardment of Vlissingen by the British Navy). In 1795, he was put in charge of the military medical service of the newly founded Batavian Republic. His outstanding work as a physician came to the attention of Louis Bonaparte, as well as to his more famous brother, who promoted him to seventh inspector- general of the Grande Armee. Later on, the first king of the Netherlands, William I, restored Brugmans to his former functions, while giving him additional duties as inspector-general of the military service, the supervision of the Navy and the Colonies, of the military veterinary service, and of sanitary conditions in prisons and quarantine stations. As a military physician, he was dedicated towards the improvement of hospital and barrack facilities. In these endeavors, he stressed the importance of cleanliness and hygiene, and strove to prevent the spread of contagious disease. He is especially remembered for his expertise in the treatment of gangrene. A genus of subtropical flowering plants known as Brugmansia is named after him.National Tropical Botanical Garden Brugmansia ×candida (Solanaceae)  References  Further reading * Category:1763 births Category:1819 deaths Category:18th-century Dutch physicians Category:Dutch botanists Category:18th- century Dutch botanists Category:University of Groningen alumni Category:University of Franeker faculty Category:Leiden University faculty Category:People from Franekeradeel ","title":"Sebald Justinus Brugmans"},{"id":"17712774","title":"Jon Prescott"},{"id":"17712789","text":"Gene J.

Bertoncini's career has included playing with Benny Goodman, Wayne Shorter, Hubert Laws, Paul Desmond, Tony Bennett, Lena Horne, Nancy Wilson, Vic Damone, Ethel Ennis, and Eydie Gorme. Bertoncini had a long- running duo with bassist Michael Moore. He was part of the staff orchestras on shows featuring Merv Griffin and Jack Paar, and most famously The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After hearing a Julian Bream record at the advice of Chuck Wayne, Bertoncini began studying classical guitar and brought the instrument into playing jazz. For some eighteen years, Bertoncini played Sunday and Monday evenings at the Bistro La Madeleine on West 43rd Street in New York City. Bertoncini has been on the faculties of Eastman School of Music, the New England Conservatory, New York University and the Banff School of Fine Arts in Alberta, Canada.

These codes are a combination of 3 alphanumeric characters and refer to a specific option or modification to the vehicle including the paint color. Thus the specific configuration of a vehicle as it exits the factory can be described by specifying the base model and the complete list of RPO codes. Even a vehicle with no extra-cost options will have some RPOs, as information like the engine type and exterior paint color are always specified. Z71 decals on a Chevy Silverado Many RPO codes have been reused over the years. For example, the ZR1 performance option was available for the Corvette for the 1970, 1990 through 1995, 2009, and 2019 model years. In some cases (such as this), the RPO specifies a package with similar function (in this case performance) to previous uses of the code. For RPOs that never became notable the code may be reused for entirely dissimilar options. In 2018, the RPO Sticker was replaced by a QR code located on the B pillar (driver's side, between front and rear doors). While fairly complete it does not contain every RPO that is on the vehicle. RPO codes as model names A few RPO codes have become notable enough that they have been used as model names. The Camaro Z28 name came from an option code which specified a performance-oriented configuration. This happened again with the Corvette Z06 models. However most RPO codes that are promoted to model names are appearance packages only, and are not related to speed or engine performance. For example, in the 1980s you could order a Z28 Camaro with a 2.5 liter engine, although this was rare.

Officially, La Real Santisíma Villa Rica de la Bendita Providencia de San Cayetano de Chone de esta nuestra Nueva Castilla in reference to Saint Cajetan and The City of Kings, called Pueblo Viejo de Chone or Señorío de Pechance was founded in the early days of the colonization. It is in Ecuador's low-lying coastal region and plays an important CHONE transportation hub. It is about seven hours by bus from the capital city of Quito. According to the political-administrative division of the Republic of Ecuador is a territory with a legal category of Canton with the same name of its river, city and urban parish. Then there are: canton, city, town and parish Chone River. In the city are the main institutions and organizations of the council of Chone. All Canton is located along half of the province of Manabi, and political geographical axis is what is known as the northern area of Manabi. It is a prosperous area with its own identity and future competitiveness that includes the connection of production and trade hub across the northern Manabi is actually half of the province, besides being a top location enshrined in folklore coastal Ecuador mainly Montubio Ecuadorian Culture. Canton is the largest area at the provincial level and a major production center for raw materials that are absorbed quickly by the national and international industry, due to the excellent quality of their crops originated. Canton excel in this traditional crop planting and nourishing fruits of various coastal area, such as cocoa, coffee, banana, cassava, and maize. Chone City The city is established on both sides of-winter-flowing river in his honor also carries his name (Rio Chone). It is located in the grasslands and lowest marsh, moist and fertile in the Ecuadorian coast, the third most populous canton of Manabi Province and one of the most extensive in the coastal region and the country. The history of this village is also planned in the revolutionary and rebellious sentiment of its inhabitants, having been one of the first cities in Ecuador that led to one of the symbolic-armed conflict highlights. Among these conflicts are the Battle of The Yellows on 1 May 1895, with Chone Liberal Proclamation which was conducted May 5, 1895, motivated and due to the political maneuvering of the then Governor of the province of Guayas, former President Jose Maria Placido Caamano with the sale of the National Flag which caused the Liberal Revolution in Ecuador immediately ignoring government of President Dr.Luis Cordero Crespo and publicly proclaimed leader of the highest office of State Gen. Don Eloy Alfaro Delgado as President of the Republic. One month after the events in Chone, with much overlap in Guayaquil, 5 June that same year proclaimed himself President at General Alfaro. Maneuver that historians attribute the first fruits of the liberal revolution and the beginning of an uprising in Manabi to the courage of local peasants and warriors montoneros of Chone. This story is also cited in some stanzas of the Ode to Chone, a tireless struggle to endure then by the following Governments with social unrest and economic disaster for the sector. Chone is also known as La Ciudad de los Naranjos in Florida due to the abundance of crops of Orange and the exquisite taste of its fruits, as well as the production of their crops mentioned. It can appoint as Cocoa Supernova, since the product originates in the area is characterized by excellent quality, authentic flavor and a pleasant aroma and palate of choice for the world, which turned into a modern Chone welcoming place for trade and commodities businesses deriving at a domestic production engine. Chone City is also known as the Garden of beautiful women and brave men, alluding to the character of the Indians who inhabited this area and the purity of the mixed race (when the Spanish arrived and Europeans on the site) that gave beautiful attractive features to its inhabitants, especially women. Other symbolic allegories have emerged, such as Athens or Florentina Manabi Ecuador, as it was one of the cities with the highest cultural life since the late nineteenth century, as happened Fever by Pepa de Oro in the world. The first indication of the existence of Chone fifteenth century when they settled the tribes of the nausea and Chonanas in places scattered around sites in the tributaries of the Rio Chone called today and its estuary. He comes to understand that the words in the Central American Indians were imported by the first inhabitants due to the commercial relationship they maintained and characterized the repeated use of the CH in their dialects and languages. When the Spanish in the mid sixteenth century came to know of the existence of nomadic tribes in those parts of the river that came to the Bay of faces, proceeded to call it as a hamlet or Lordship of Indo-Hispanic Pechance, because the area had live acts spread of homes and because they so called themselves Indians and other residents who lived in the present territory of Chone. Spanish chroniclers of mid-sixteenth century spoke of the great river that was to lead a league in a splendid bay, where they could fit quietly and establish marine craft and boats. The year 2008 is the third city of Manabi in population and economy. Canton purely agricultural and livestock production, has the largest number of cattle in Ecuador. The City is surrounded by hills and slopes are small systems of coastal elevations with heights in excess of 100 meters above sea level. The village is located in a valley crossed by the Rio Chone being the largest watershed in the province. This canton is dynamic, hospitable and is home to beautiful women and men responsible aspiration being deployed in academic instruction. According to unofficial data set for the public, as a parish church, was founded on 7 August 1735, by the religious portovejense Fray José Antonio Cedeño and Macias, and named as Villa de San Cayetano de Chone or officially named Hispanic La Villa Rica Real Holy Order of the Blessed San Cayetano de Chone desta Our New Castile, because the city was founded not only on behalf of the saint but also inherits the titration manifesto The Royal Viceroy knew characterize the protection small towns to take with them before their official name always precedes a prefix that connects with the City of Los Reyes, which was the seat of the Viceroyalty of Peru. On 7 August, this date is understood not as Spanish foundation parroquialización, because this political-religious maneuvering was one step from the famous Bourbon Reforms headed by the reign of Philip V of Spain. The aim of the Bourbon Reforms was to define the accuracy of vast unexplored territories of the Spanish crown in the American colonies overseas, in the limited areas of each estate, mainly in the sparsely appointed interior of Atacama, where Chone part of its jurisdiction administrative policy in the Royal Audience of Quito. The latter was dependent on the government with serious demographic problems of supply and public administration, i.e., that these territories depended chonenses Atacames legally and geographically, but politically Quito. Spanish Foundation of Canton Chone came at a time when the supremacy of western European culture was thriving social entertainment, being the highest authority of this land was then the Viceroy of Peru XXVIII Don Jose de Armendariz and Perurena, Prime Castelfuerte Marquis. The foundation date on the Catholic calendar coincides with the anniversary of the death of San Cayetano de Thiene, the saint of workers. It is very important to add that the territory which contains the principal city of Chone, rises in the terrain that is surrounded by rugged mountains and swampy jungle that eventually ascends along the infrastructure of buildings and houses built on small city. In other words, urban design is intertwined in the middle and along a small semicircle of mountains with lush vegetation and exotic ancient, possibly on the moon. This vegetation covers only the cardinal directions from the northeast to the southeast in relation to the situation of demographic expansion in Canton, then forming the legitimate Chone semicircle Lunar mountain which rises in these characteristics and definitions. Today is a real virtue of the city geographically, suggesting the famous and notable antihipótesis and Spanish custom of founding cities near mountain ranges and adjacent shores or limiting the placement of the nomadic tribes in the area. Chone is definitely a move over the Spanish conquest in the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito and planned since the existence of tribes and civilizations that inhabited the area by the fifteenth century, but states that the current location of the city is due to decisions that chose to promote the indigenous, but not Spanish delegations that were by small indigenous settlements. But it is clear that the current city was established here because of the presence of the river that served as a channel and market penetration, showing signs of economic improvement in Cocoa Boom of the late nineteenth century, where Chone became a city recognized for the quality of this popular fruit of exotic origin. Physically, the lunar crescent Chone mountain is a natural phenomenon that is understood by the elevation of a group of mountains that form a single circular chain around the city at the cardinal points already mentioned. It can be clearly seen from the bridge that extends in a diagonal road towards the monument to the Liberal Proclaims June 5, 1895 in the site which is known today as the banners on the road just leads to the parishes of San Antonio and the cantons of San Vicente, Sucre, Tosagua, Rocafuerte and Portoviejo. Perhaps the Spanish only be undertaken on track layout and request that the Indians showed them to found the city is located today, citing Guayas Hill is part of the semicircular or lunar chain surrounding the city in full point cardinal East, where the main urban area is defined. To the urban and rural development Chone rightful economic organization of the City from Cocoa Boom in the late nineteenth century and its Cantonización on 24 July 1894, apart from the events that were undertaken subsequently. Scientific studies and anonymous certain educational institutions like the now-defunct Canton Reforestation Program The Educational Center Bejucal (Parish of St. Rita) argue that the northern Manabi territory includes some of the lowest in the Andean atmosphere, but that characterize the strong presence of fertile and productive contributors oxygen and forest resources for the planet. This area has a wealth of endemic and exotic flora of Ecuador, which would consider that the contribution of Chone forest remains at a significant level by the abundance of land and vegetation contributors to the improvement and cleaning of the ecosystems of the Province Manabi and country. Chone is complemented by its eastern neighbors: Flavio Alfaro and Carmen, which also promote business and agriculture and livestock generating the wealth of the territory where their cities were settled, as these cantons in the past were part of the jurisdiction of Chone until the decade of 60 and 80 respectively. Around town chonense mountains and hills rise to 500 meters swamp forming a single high mountains around the city where most of the limitations of the compass. The Pacific Ocean Cedeño Mendoza writer says: \\"All the Canton Chone, far and wide, tinged with gentle hills that give origin to endless streams or creeks that flow into marshes or barricades or in one of five major rivers that born in their land: Chone Quininde, Jama, Canuto Grande and the Rio de Oro Daule tributary. The mountain resembles a small stream or micro extraction of the Western Cordillera of the Andes. On the west side and northwest of the city is surrounded by three terraqua elevations which are defined as three hills, and the greatest of these is located in the middle forming the popular tourist lookout Cerro Guayas, where is built the statue of Christ the Redeemer of Chone. History Chone was founded on August 7, 1735 by a friar from Portoviejo, Jose Antonion Cedeño. Cedeno called the town, Villa de San Cayetano de Chone Chone, Provincial Government of Manabi 12 August 2009 Chone grew rapidly as a center for agriculture and transportation. Geography Due to the city's location, it is unfortunately prone to damaging floods during the coast's rainy season. During this time, the streets often become inundated with rain water, creating havoc on the mud streets. Many of the cities residents have taken to constructing homes on bamboo stilts to keep out the water. The city lies on the banks of the important Rio Chone. Further west, the river becomes an estuary, opening to the coastal cities of Bahia de Caraquez and San Vicente. The closest beaches are about two hours away in different directions. They include Crucita, San Vicente and San Clemente. The city of Manta has a popular beach and was home to an American military base in charge of helping battle the drug trade. Culture A popular fish is called chame (Chah-mee); known in English as the Pacific fat sleeper (Dormitator latifrons), it has many bones but is considered tasty. It is fried and served with rice, platano (plantain) and a small salad.

Pengra, in July 1865, while they were making a preliminary survey for the Oregon Central Military Road, which would later become Oregon Route 58. The lake fills a basin carved by a glacier, and the resulting terminal moraine confines the water along the lake's southeast shore.

The place was also known as Odell Lake Resort, and today is the site of Odell Lake Lodge. The historic lodge building was constructed in 1903. Recreation Odell Lake offers recreational opportunities similar to nearby Crescent Lake, which is to the south. There are several developed campgrounds around Odell Lake, as well as boat ramps that allow for sailing, wind surfing, water skiing and fishing.

Geographic range It is native to the Bahama Islands, the Cayman Islands and Cuba. It was introduced intentionally in Palm Beach, Florida, in the 1940s in an attempt to control sugar cane pests, and is now also present in a few other parts of the state. Another introduced population inhabits Swan Islands, Honduras. Description Adults may attain a snout to vent length (SVL) of , or a total length, including the tail, of . The dorsal scales are keeled and pointed. L. carinatus resembles lizards of the genus Sceloporus, but with the tail usually curled upward, especially when the lizard is in a horizontal position on rocks or on the ground.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. . (Leiocephalus carinatus, pp. 132-133.) Behavior An active, robust lizard, it is mostly terrestrial and will retreat into a burrow or cavity when frightened. It prefers sunny areas with loose rubble and rock. In the Cayman Islands a large captured specimen was observed to consistently burrow completely under the sand in a holding tank, even though a rock retreat was provided. The lizard also \\"played dead\\" when handled and remained completely motionless for a short while after being put down. The Leiocephalus carinatus utilizes tail curling as an antipredator measure when being chased. This behavior is predominantly seen when the predator is distant, as it is an attempt to intimidate would-be pursuers; when the predator is close however, the lizard instead seeks immediate refuge.Cooper, W.

Their second Dualtone album release of 2005, after their debut 2003 album Movin' On was re-released earlier in the year by their label Dualtone Records, Weather and Water was released on June 28. In a review of Weather and Water in The Washington Post, it was noted that on this album, unlike their debut, the focus was on the music supporting lyrics, rather than the blues virtuosity of Movin' On. In another review, Jim Abbott of the Tribune News Service described The Greencards as polished, \\"earthy, charming roots music with a sophisticated sheen\\", but noted that some bluegrass purists may miss the vocal idiosyncrasies that can be found on other bluegrass bands such as the Del McCoury Band. All three members of the band sing on Weather and Water, but Young's voice was noted for its \\"dreamy, haunting quality\\". Their music through the Weather and Water album had been called Celtic-influenced and bluegrass-flavored, but noted that the band had a distinctly American sound despite their overseas origins. Jason Gonulsen of Glide Magazine noted that The Greencards' debut Movin' On didn't capture the band's live energy, but that Weather and Water overcame this, and was one of 2005's best bluegrass albums. In the wake of their release, the band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. The music video for the band's single \\"Time\\" from Weather and Water received heavy airplay and rotation on Country Music Television. \\"Time\\" was described as the centerpiece track of Weather and Water. Country Music Television named Weather and Water one of the ten favorite bluegrass albums of the year, saying, \\"At the nexus of bluegrass, country and pop, this charming trio immediately win over such diverse audiences in concert. Luckily, their winning personality translates to this disc -- even with several melancholy, yet melodic, songs. Not for nothing did Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson choose them to open their summer tour of minor league ballparks.\\" The Greencards were the opening act for Dylan and Nelson on their 2005 summer tour. Kym Warner credits Gary Paczosa, an engineer that worked on Weather and Water, with helping them getting the opportunity to tour with Dylan and Nelson. Paczosa had previously served as an engineer on recordings for Alison Krauss, Nickel Creek and Dolly Parton. \\"He makes the best-sounding acoustic records in the world\\", according to Warner. During their tour with Dylan and Nelson, Buzz McClain of The Washington Post observed that The Greencards plays traditional American music due to their deep respect for the material than most American musicians do. Throughout 2005, they toured extensively with Dylan and Nelson, and afterwards toured with Tommy Emmanuel. Coinciding with their move to Nashville in late 2005, and work on their second album Weather and Water, it was seen as a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead focus on Americana-focused music. During the 2005 summer tour, Kym Warner wanted to get the chance to pick Dylan's brain, but never had the chance. Warner did not get to spend much time with him, but Dylan told him at the end of the tour, “You’ll be fine from now on.” Track listing References External links *Official site, thegreencards.com *Official MySpace for the Greencards *Country Music Television Profile *The Greencards collection at the Internet Archive's live music archive Category:2005 albums Category:The Greencards albums ","title":"Weather and Water"},{"id":"17713185","text":"Pambak or P’ambak may refer to: *Pambak, Gegharkunik, Armenia *Pambak, Lori, Armenia *Sipan, Armenia, formerly Pambak *Pambak River *Pambak mountains ","title":"Pambak"},{"id":"17713191","text":"Mizan is comprehensive treatise on the contents of Islam, written by the Pakistani Islamic scholar Javed Ahmad Ghamidi.

After the success of their second album Late as Usual (1994), Neill Burnett and Moritz Behm left the band and were replaced by Shannon Saunders and Shona LeMotte, both of whom came from musical families and had been steeped in Celtic and bluegrass traditions for years. After a tour of the United States, flutist Hanz Araki joined the band in 1996. The new members of the band drew the band into an increasingly world music-based direction, and began work on Molinos shortly afterwards. The band recorded the album at Vancouver's Mushroom Studios with rock producer John Webster in spring and summer 1997. The band tried to create an album that showed the band's disparate musical influences in world music, with the record combining influences from Celtic, bluegrass, Mexican, African, Latin and Eastern European music, but in an effective, radio-friendly way. The band tried to capture the energy and feel of their live shows on the record. The album also contains numerous guest musicians and interjects numerous jigs and reels, both new and traditional, into the band's pop songs. The album was released by the band's own label Stompy Discs, in association with Stony Plain Records, in October 1997. Two singles were issued from the album, \\"After the First Time\\" and \\"Molinos\\". The latter became the band's most commercially successful song, with it and its music video being picked up on radio and video stations, although most notably, adult album alternative station in Seattle called The Mountain added the single to their playlist, and as such proved very popular with its listeners, with attenders of the band's Seattle concerts tripling. The album itself received critical acclaim, with critics complimenting its musical style, songs, influences and production. In 1998, Molinos won the Juno Award for \\"Best Roots and Traditional Album\\" and the West Coast Music Award for \\"Best Roots Recording\\". Background The Paperboys were originally formed as a Celtic rock band in Vancouver 1991 by bassist Christopher Jonat and Tom Landa on acoustic guitar and vocals, with Jeremy Hughes on accordion and vocals, Kevin Ball on fiddle, and Dave Plenkovich on drums. This early version of the band was very popular with the Vancouver college crowds, but, after creative discrepancies, Tom kept the Paperboys name and all the other remaining bandmembers reformed as The Clumsy Lovers. Initially, Landa discovered Celtic music via the Canadian band Spirit of the West, whose flautist and co-vocalist was Geoffrey Kelly. After becoming a line-up of Landa, Cam Salay and Moritz Behm, and releasing a cassette-only release entitled January (1992), The Paperboys soon added Neil Burnett to the band on whistles and harp and, later, drummer Paul \\"Lolly\\" Lawton through a \\"Musicians Wanted\\" advertisement.Tenure liner notes. With this line-up, the band recorded their first official album, Late as Usual (1994), with producers Kelly and Colin Nairne, producer and guitarist for Barney Bentall. Released on St. Patrick's Day 1994, Late as Usual was promoted with the band's first Canadian tour, where they \\"crossed the country sleeping on couches, playing in dingy bars and Irish pubs,\\" with Landa recalling that \\"had it not been for our families who fed us along the way and gave us both encouragement and a place to sleep, that first tour would have broken us.\\" Upon returning from the tour, they found some minor success when, after filming a music video for the Late as Usual song \\"She Said\\", the video found some airplay on \\"Canada's MTV\\", MuchMusic, whilst the CBC and several college radio stations also added the song to their playlists in both Canada and the United States, whilst in January 1995, the album went on to garner a Juno Award nomination for Roots and Traditional Album of the Year, which Landa said was \\"a definite nod from the industry that we were on the right track.\\" Nonetheless, in the advent of their second tour being booked, Neil Burnett and Moritz Behm left the band to pursue other musical ventures and finish their studies, leaving the three remaining band members to quickly find two replacements, Shannon Saunders (fiddles, accordion and bass) and Shona LeMotte (fiddle), a line-up change which radically changed the band's sound. Saunders and LeMotte came from musical families and had been steeped in Celtic and bluegrass traditions for years. The new five-piece line-up concentrated more on playing in the United States in cities such as Seattle and San Francisco, and it was at one of these shows where they met Seattle resident Hanz Araki, a skilled flutist and shakuhachi player, who in 1996 joined the band, again dramatically changing the band's sound and \\"bringing with him not only a unique ethnic background but also a well-studied Irish sensibility.\\" It was with this new line-up and a new batch of songs that the band began work on their second album Molinos.Liner notes. Recording Molinos was recorded in Mushroom Studios, Vancouver. The new line-up of the band began work on the songs on Molinos in 1996, and in the spring and summer of 1997, the band recorded Molinos at Mushroom Studios, in Vancouver, British Columbia, a recording studio with a long history in Canadian music. In aiming to achieve a new sound, the band hired prolific rock producer John Webster to produce the album. Webster also engineered and mixed the album, whilst Peter Wosniak co-engineered it.Molinos liner notes. Overdubs were recorded at Beatty Lane and Chaz Jean Studios, whilst the album was mixed at The Warehouse with the assistance of Gary Winger, and was mastered by Geore Leger at Utopia Parkway. For Molinos, the band tried to capture the energy and feel of their live shows as best as they could, despite their belief that \\"nothing quite compares to an actual concert.\\" Due to the new line-up of the band changing the band's sound considerably from their original, more traditional Celtic rock sound, the band wanted to achieve a sound that blended all of the band's musical interests, from disparate world genres that, besides Celtic music, also included African, Latin, bluegrass and Eastern European music, but with a contemporary edge that meant music from the album could still be played on the radio. Landa said that becoming a pop band was not the group's aim but that commercial radio stations could use a \\"good dose of ethnic and roots music, \\" and considered Webster to be, \\"odd though it sounds, the perfect choice for what we were trying to do.\\" The band hoped that listeners would feel inspired to discover \\"the roots of this music\\" which had in turn inspired the band to make the album. Numerous guest musicians recorded parts for the album; \\"Crashing Down\\" features vocal contributions from Steve Mitchell, Danny Kramer, Anette Ducharme, Jane Sawyer and guitar work from Alpha Yaya Diallo, Graham MacLennan performs pipes on \\"Pound a Week Rise\\", Ducharme also performs vocals on \\"Molinos\\", \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Waste Some Time\\", the latter of which Kramer also sings on, whilst Webster himself performs a B3 Hammond organ on \\"After the First Time\\" and \\"Salvation\\", Harmonium on \\"Molinos\\", keyboards on \\"Same for Everyone\\" and \\"percussion on a bunch of stuff.\\" Musical style An eclectic worldbeat album, Molinos features several disparate regional types of traditional music and fuses them with accessible pop music, production and melodies. David Kidman of NetRhythms called the album a \\"vigorous fusion of rootsy pop\\" with distinct Celtic, bluegrass and Latin influences. Landa said that although the material on Molinos is \\"a mix of folk and roots, we wanted to come up with a sound that blended all of our interests - Celtic, bluegrass, Latin, African and Eastern European–but could still get play on the radio. Not that becoming a pop band was our ultimate goal, but I believed (and still do) that Top 40 radio is mostly full of shit and could use a good dose of ethnic and roots music.\\" NetRhythms also stated that the album \\"almost effortlessly conveys the high energy for which they've been renowned at festivals in recent years, certainly\\" and said that at times the band's \\"driving full-frontal sound and approach\\" reminded me of Tanglefoot, at others of the Waterboys or Oysterband without that same degree of political edge, at others there are hints of Los Lobos, the Specials, Ukrainian dance, South African townships jive and klezmer–\\"all wonderful stuff!\\" A Mexican influence is also prominent on the album. Rick Anderson of Allmusic said that \\"what the Paperboys bring to the table with their version of Celtic rock is something lacking in almost all of the other fine, artists who have taken a similar approach: namely, consistent skill at writing real pop songs with unembarrassing lyrics and honest-to- goodness melodic hooks.\\" He noted how on Molinos, the Paperboys \\"play traditional jigs and reels with solid conviction but almost always as adjuncts to their original songs. The effect can be thrilling.\\" Another critic, Tom Knapp of cultural arts magazine Rambles, characterized the album as possessing: \\"an 'infectious' style of accessible, bluegrass-tinged pop rock which definitely makes listeners aware that, yes indeed, a Celtic influence is at work here. Just listen to Shona Le Mottee's blistering fiddle riffs or Hank Araki's swirling whistle solos in some of the band's bouncy dance songs if you don't believe me.\\" Most of the album's are written by the band's main songwriter and singer Landa and have a \\"wistful pop air about them, but there's a driving undercurrent of Celtic wildness and bluegrass stylings which set the Paperboys apart from their just-pop peers.\\" Multiple Celtic-bluegrass breakdowns are said to \\"fill the album.\\" Composition First half \\"Waste Some Time\\" was influenced by Lonesome Jubilee by John Mellencamp (pictured). The opening song and title track \\"Molinos\\", co-written with Annette Ducharme who had written or co-written several hits for several Canadian artists, was written \\"partly over the phone\\" and was inspired by a poster with the message \\"They are only windmills, they cannot hear you.\\" The song was the band's first to feature a drum loop, which was described by one critic as \\"a dance-floor drum beat, and tells the story of someone who \\"doesn't quite fit in.\\" Incorporating elements of \\"The Foxhunters Reel\\", Landa considers the song \\"the perfect blend of pop and Celtic.\\" \\"Salvation\\", a song about \\"love lost to god,\\" incorporates the John Campbell-written reel \\"Sandy MacIntyre's Trip to Boston\\" for \\"added flair\\" and in the words of Landa, was inspired by how \\"values and religion are very sacred and beautiful things. The spiritual path is never an easy one and sometimes people get lost along the way.\\" Drummer Paul Lawton wrote \\"Waste Some Time\\", a song heavily influenced by John Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee (1987) and features Webster on Hammond organ. Concerning the song's subject matter, Landa said that \\"some of the best days are when the map has been lost and the plans have been thrown away. Besides, that's what answering machines are for.\\"Molinos booklet \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\", a cover of the Lennon-McCartney-composed Beatles folk song from Help! (1965), is given a \\"not-too-breakneck rocked-up bluegrassy treatment\\" and incorporates the \\"Coast of Austria\\" reel. Lawton wrote \\"Same for Everyone\\" and remains one of Landa's favourite Paperboys songs.Tenure booklet. Although the band tried several times to play the song live, they thought it was overshadowed by the \\"faster, more aggressive songs\\" as a result of \\"the danger of playing in night clubs,\\" but Landa thought they captured the essence of the song in the recording. The first part of \\"Annabell's Reel/Theme Time\\" was written by Cam for a dance company and named for \\"a small furry friend,\\" whilst the second part, \\"Theme Time\\", is \\"typical of 50s polyester bluegrass.\\" Landa, speaking about the lyrical inspiration for \\"Crashing Down\\", said \\"When I was in school, I used to write letters to the South African government on behalf of Amnesty International. It seemed back then that our efforts were in vain. I'm glad I was wrong. Don't give up!\\" Second half \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" begins with an Araki whistle set in slow, airy motion, before kicking into two fast-paced jigs, \\"The Breathing Method\\" and \\"The Jaunt\\". \\"After the First Time You Lose\\" was written by Landa and guest singer Steve Mitchell for the alternative country band Yard Sale, who were described as \\"sort of a Paperboys spin-off band.\\" The song incorporates the reel \\"Mrs. Wedderburn's Reel. (For Katie.)\\" and lyrically concerns \\"feeling tired and discouraged.\\" \\"Drunken Wagoneer\\", which features double fiddle, is radically different from the original fiddle tune it is based on, and showcases Saunders' \\"great fiddle playing and ear for harmony and arrangement.\\" Webster added an additional edge with some distortion on almost every instrument, and due to its double fiddle work, is rarely played live by the band, although Landa later noted that he \\"loves it\\" and \\"always thought it would be perfect for a soundtrack.\\" \\"Pound a Week Rise\\", a \\"miners' song\\" written by Ed Pickford with music composed by Cam Salay, began life as a tune called \\"The Blue Velvet Dress\\" which evolved into a song the band learnt from Dick Gaughan, and incorporates the reel \\"Tommy's Tarbukas\\", written by Alasdair Fraser. The highly Celtic-influenced \\"Swallow's Tail Jig/Cabin Fever Ceilidh/Swallow's Tail Reel\\", a set of tunes incorporating newly written pieces and traditional tunes, was first arranged for Vancouver's Celtic Festival and then became a regular in the band's set list. The \\"Cabin Fever Ceilidh\\" part was written by le Mottee for his friend Ray Beattie. Discussing the lyrics of \\"Oh Maria\\", which incorporates ska influences, Landa said \\"In Mexico there's a saying... 'El que se fue a la villa, perdio su silla,' which means 'He who snoozes - loses'.\\" \\"Ray's Ukrainian Wine Cellar Polka/Nelli's Afterthought\\" closes the album. The band named the first polka from Ray Colosimo of Thunder Bay, Ontario, late one night after a gig; the band recalled that they sat in his basement, or wine cellar as they exchanged tunes and home-made vino. Colosimo only knew that it was a Ukrainian wedding polka that didn't have a title or author, hence why the band came up with the title, and after this, Saunders was inspired to write the second polka. Tom Knapp of Rambles said \\"if this doesn't end your listening experience on a foot-tapping upbeat, your volume must be down all the way.\\" Release and promotion Molinos was released on October 21, 1997 by two Canada-based independent record labels, the band's self-established Stompy Discs and Stony Plain Records. Despite its autumn 1997 release date, some sources have incorrectly retrospectively cited its release date as July 1, 1997 or July 10, 1997. The album title comes from the Spanish for \\"windmills.\\" The artwork was designed by Ralph Alfonso and features a painting by Robert Cerins on the album cover and illustrations of musical instruments by Tom Bogley within the liner notes. Unusually for a roots fusion band, the sources for the interpolated tunes, such as the reels, are fully credited in the insert notes. The band dedicated the album to the memory of Stewart Wickens.Back cover. Two singles were released from Molinos; the first, \\"After the First Time\\", also had a music video produced and received airplay on Canada's CMT, MuchMusic and numerous other radio stations and music video channels across Canada. However, the second single, \\"Molinos\\", was according to Landa what \\"really started things moving.\\" A music video for the song starring Dean Meehan was produced, and both the song and the video were picked up on radio and video stations, again including CMT. According to the band, the biggest surprise was when the Seattle-based adult album alternative radio station The Mountain added the single to their playlist; Landa commented \\"bless those commercial stations that play independent bands.\\" The song got a huge response from the station's listeners who started requesting it constantly. The attendance at the band's shows in Seattle subsequently tripled and copies of the disc could not be printed fast enough; Landa recalled \\"we felt like rock stars.\\"  Critical reception  The album was released to unanimous critical acclaim, with music critics praising, among numerous points, the album's songs, musical work and production. Tom Knapp of Rambles was very favourable in his review, in which he concluded that \\"Canada just keeps sending more and more good stuff down south over the border into the States. With any luck, a few more American musicians will be inspired to put out good stuff like this. In the meantime, there's the Paperboys to help carry the slack. What are you waiting for?\\" Rick Anderson of Allmusic rated the album four stars out of five and said \\"the band's playing is solid and nicely idiomatic, but never academic or stiff. Singer/guitarist Tom Landa has a good voice and knows how to shape a song, and fiddlers Shona le Mottee and Shannon Saunders weave a sparkling fabric around and behind him. This album is a delight from beginning to end.\\" In a retrospective review published in the 2000s, David Kidman of NetRhythms was favourable and said that \\"The Paperboys have been going for over ten years, but this album's been my first exposure to the band. And wow! for it's a superior, vigorous fusion of rootsy pop with distinct Celtic, bluegrass and Latin influences. And what I hear, I like rather a lot.\\" He concluded that \\"I understand that the band have latterly moved away from the Celtic and bluegrass influences and more into the realms of soul. Molinos, however, hasn't dated one iota, and is one of the most rousing and infectious CDs of its kind – look no further for some truly vital hardcore roots music that puts most other worldbeat practitioners firmly in the shade.\\" The combination of critical success and fan popularity lead to Red House Records naming the album the band's \\"breakthrough\\", and noted it gave the band a strong following in the United States. In the spring of 1998, Molinos won the Juno Award for \\"Best Roots and Traditional Album\\", the first time the band had won the award.

He is renowned in Kollywood for both the sensuality of his melodies and the charisma of his work. From his rendition Netriunthom Engal Vitulilae with acclaimed tracks, such as \\"Pattu Selai\\", Niru has become a popular musician. He recently debuted in Tamil films as the music composer in the film Kalabha Kadhalan. Biography Having found a passion for music at an early age, Niru discovered an affinity to all things musical. Though greatly adept at playing instruments, Niru found his forté lay in composing his own music and directing the celebrated musicians of the world. In 1989, Niru moved to Paris, France, where he was in the tutelage of the Maison Populaire. There, he ameliorated and fine tuned his precision and skill for manipulating melodies. Niru graduated from SAE (Paris) in 2001, a prestigious institute with the links to Oxford, UK. Niru then progressed to study Western classical music at the Trinity College of Music, London. 2001 onwards Starting small, Niru initially began by composing jingles for advertisements, soon to be followed by a \\"nouvelle vague\\" which brought Tamil Pop to the forefront of music in France. His interest in pop music spurred him to compose for two albums, \\"Oru Parvai\\" and \\"Aalaiyin Karangal\\" in Paris, both of which proved to be illuminating. \\"Moongil Nila\\", album-extraordinaire and Niru's 3rd masterpiece encapsulated the vocal genius of P.

It flourished during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III in France (1852–1871) and had an important influence on architecture and decoration in the rest of Europe and the United States. Major examples of the style include the Opéra Garnier (1862–1871) in Paris by Charles Garnier, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, and the Church of Saint Augustine (1860–1871). The architectural style was closely connected with Haussmann's renovation of Paris carried out during the Second Empire; the new buildings, such as the Opéra, were intended as the focal points of the new boulevards. Characteristics Ceiling of the Grand Salon of the Opéra Garnier (1862–1875) The Napoleon III or Second Empire style took its inspiration from several different periods and styles, which were often combined together in the same building or interior. The interior of the Opéra Garnier by Charles Garnier combined architectural elements of the French Renaissance, Palladian architecture, and French Baroque, and managed to give it coherence and harmony. The Lions Gate of the Louvre Palace by Hector Lefuel is a Louis-Napoléon version of French Renaissance architecture; few visitors to the Louvre realize it is a 19th- century addition to the building.Ducher, Robert, Caractéristique des styles (1988), pages 188-190 Another characteristic of Napoleon III style is the adaptation of the design of the building to its function and the characteristics of the material used. Examples include the Gare du Nord railway station by Jacques Ignace Hittorff, the Church of Saint Augustin by Victor Baltard, and particularly the iron-framed structures of the market of Les Halles and the reading room of the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris, both also by Victor Baltard. A basic principle of Napoleon III interior decoration was leave no space undecorated. Another principle was polychromy, an abundance of color obtained by using colored marble, malachite, onyx, porphyry, mosaics, and silver or gold plated bronze. Wood panelling was often encrusted with rare and exotic woods, or darkened to resemble ebony. The façade of the Opéra Garnier employed seventeen different colored materials, including various marbles, stones, and bronze.Texier, Simon, Paris- Panorama de l'architecture, (2012), page 95 Architecture Paris Opera full frontal architecture, May 2009.jpgThe Palais Garnier in Paris GarnierOperaParis.jpgThe grand stairway of the Paris Opera, designed by Charles Garnier, in the style he called simply \\"Napoleon III\\" Central market, Paris, France.

It was so named for the architectural elements in vogue during the era of the Second French Empire.Copplestone, Trewin, ed., World Architecture: An illustrated history from earliest times, Crescent Books, New York, 1963 pp.310-311 As the Second Empire style evolved from its 17th-century Renaissance foundations, it acquired a mix of earlier European styles, most notably the Baroque, often combined with mansard roofs and/or low, square-based domes.Copplestone, p. 310. The style quickly spread and evolved as Baroque Revival architecture throughout Europe and across the Atlantic. Its suitability for super-scaling allowed it to be widely used in the design of municipal and corporate buildings. In the United States, where one of the leading architects working in the style was Alfred B. Mullett, buildings in the style were often closer to their 17th-century roots than examples of the style found in Europe.Copplestone, p. 311. The dominant architectural style of the Second Empire was eclecticism, drawing liberally from the Gothic style, Renaissance style, and the styles dominant during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The style was described by Émile Zola, not an admirer of the Empire, as \\"the opulent bastard child of all the styles\\".Zola, Emile, Nana. The best example was the Opéra Garnier, begun in 1862 but not finished until 1875. The architect was Charles Garnier (1825–1898), who won the competition for the design when he was only thirty- seven. When asked by the Empress Eugénie what the style of the building was called, he replied simply, \\"Napoleon III\\". At the time, it was the largest opera house in the world, but much of the interior space was devoted to purely decorative spaces: grand stairways, huge foyers for promenading, and large private boxes. Another example was the Mairie, or city hall, of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, built in 1855–1861 in a neo-Gothic style by the architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1792–1867).Renault, Christophe and Lazé, Christophe, 'Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier, (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot. () The Industrial Revolution was beginning to demand a new kind of architecture: bigger, stronger and less expensive. The new age of railways and the enormous increase in travel that it caused required new train stations, large hotels, exposition halls and department stores in Paris. While the exteriors of most Second Empire monumental buildings usually remained eclectic, a revolution was taking place inside; based on the model of The Crystal Palace in London (1851), Parisian architects began to use cast iron frames and walls of glass in their buildings.Renault, Christophe and Lazé, Christophe, Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier, (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot. The most dramatic use of iron and glass was in the new central market of Paris, Les Halles (1853–1870), an ensemble of huge iron and glass pavilions designed by Victor Baltard (1805–1874) and Félix-Emmanuel Callet (1792–1854). Jacques-Ignace Hittorff also made extensive use of iron and glass in the interior of the new Gare du Nord train station (1842–1865), although the façade was perfectly neoclassical, decorated with classical statues representing the cities served by the railway. Baltard also used a steel frame in building the largest new church to be built in Paris during the Empire, the Church of Saint Augustine (1860–1871). While the structure was supported by cast iron columns, the façade was eclectic. Henri Labrouste (1801–1875) also used iron and glass to create a dramatic cathedral-like reading room for the National Library, Richelieu site (1854–1875).Renault, Christophe and Lazé, Christophe, 'Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier, (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot. () The Second Empire also saw the completion or restoration of several architecture treasures: the wings of the Louvre Museum were finally completed, the famed stained glass windows and structure of the Sainte-Chapelle were restored by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, and the Cathedral of Notre-Dame underwent extensive restoration. In the case of the Louvre in particular, the restorations were sometimes more imaginative than precisely historical.

Neo-Gothic and other historical styles began to be built, particularly in the eight new arrondissements farther from the center added by Napoleon III in 1860. The first neo-Gothic church was the Basilica of Sainte-Clothilde, begun by Christian Gau in 1841 and finished by Théodore Ballu in 1857. During the Second Empire, architects began to use metal frames combined with the Gothic style: the Eglise Saint-Laurent, a 15th-century church rebuilt in neo-Gothic style by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862–65), Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cecile by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lusson (1854–55), and Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville by Jean-Bapiste Lassus (1854–59). The largest new church built in Paris during the Second Empire was Church of Saint Augustine (1860–71) by Victor Baltard, the designer of the metal pavilions of the market of Les Halles. While the façade was eclectic, the structure inside was modern, supported by slender cast iron columns. Not all churches under Napoleon III were built in the Gothic style. Marseille Cathedral, constructed from 1852 to 1896, was designed in a Byzantine Revival style from 1852 to 1896, principally by Léon Vaudoyer and Henri-Jacques Espérandieu.

Between 1864 and 1868, He commissioned the architect Hector Lefuel to rebuild the Pavillon de Flore from the Renaissance Louvre; Lefuel added many of his own decorations and ideas to the pavilion, including a sculpture of Flore by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. He also added apartments for the Empress, visible today, and rebuilt entirely the Porte des Lions of the Louvre in a graceful and harmonious if not perfectly historical style. This gateway originally featured a statue of Napoleon III over the central arch, which was removed during the Third Republic. The apartments of the Empress Eugénie were in the part of the Louvre reconstructed by Napoleon III, and escaped destruction during the Paris Commune. They were long occupied by the French Ministry of Finance, but have been restored to their original appearance, and present a good illustration of the Napoleon III style.

Chairs were elaborately upholstered with fringes, tassels, and expensive fabrics. Tapestry work on furniture was very much in style. The structure of chairs and sofas was usually entirely hidden by the upholstery or ornamented with copper, shell, or other decorative elements. Novel and exotic new materials, such as bamboo, papier-mâché, and rattan, were used for the first time in European furniture, along with polychrome wood, and wood painted with black lacquer. The upholstered pouffe, or footstool, appeared, along with the angle sofa and unusual chairs for intimate conversations between two persons (Le confident) or three people (Le indiscret). The crapaud (or toad) armchair was low, with a thickly padded back and arms, and a fringe that hid the legs of the chair. The French Renaissance and the Henry II style were popular influences on chests and cabinets, buffets and credences, which were massive and built like small cathedrals, decorated with columns, frontons, cartouches, mascarons, and carved angels and chimeras. They were usually constructed of walnut or oak, or sometimes of poirier stained to resemble ebony. Another popular influence was the Louis XVI style, or French neoclassicism, which was preferred by the Empress Eugénie. Her rooms at the Tuileries Palace and other Places were decorated in this style.

The buildings of the renovation show a singularity of purpose and design, a consistency of urban planning that was unusual for the period. Numerous public edifices: railway stations, the tribunal de commerce, and the Palais Garnier were constructed in the style. The major buildings, including the Opera House and the St. Augustine church, were designed to be the focal points of the new avenues, and to be visible at a great distance. Napoleon III also built monumental fountains to decorate the heart of the city; his Paris city architect, Gabriel Davioud, designed the polychrome Fontaine Saint-Michel (officially the Fontaine de la Paix) at the beginning of Haussmann's new Boulevard Saint-Michel. Davioud's other major Napoleon III works included the two theatres at the Place du Châtelet, as well as the ornamental fence of Parc Monceau and the kiosks and temples of the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, and other Paris parks. The expansion of the city limits by Napoleon III and Haussmann's new boulevards called for the construction of a variety of new public buildings, including the new Tribunal du Commerce (1861–67), influenced by the French Renaissance style, by Théodore Ballu; and the new city hall of the 1st arrondissement, by Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1855–60), in a combination of Renaissance and Gothic styles. The new city hall was located next to the Gothic church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois. Between the two structures, the architect Théodore Ballu constructed a Gothic bell tower (1862), to link the two buildings. New types of architecture connected with the economic expansion: railroad stations, hotels, office buildings, department stores and exposition halls, occupied the center of Paris, which previously had been largely residential. To improve traffic circulation and bring light and air to the center of the city, Napoleon's Prefect of the Seine destroyed the crumbling and overcrowded neighborhoods in the heart of the city and built a network of grand boulevards. The expanded use of new building materials, especially iron frames, allowed the construction of much larger buildings for commerce and industry. Architectural restoration Napoleon III commissioned Eugène Viollet-le-Duc to restore the medieval town of Carcassonne in 1853. Another aspect of the Napoleon III style was the restoration of historical monuments which had been badly damaged during the French Revolution, or were threatened with destruction by the growth of cities. This program was largely carried out by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, whose neo-Gothic design for a new Paris Opera later came in second to that of Garnier. The restoration of Notre-Dame, begun in 1845, continued for twenty-five years. Some of its additions varied from the originals. Viollet-le Duc restored the flèche, or spirelet, of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, which had been partially destroyed and desecrated during the French Revolution, in a slightly different style, and added gargoyles which had not originally been present to the façade. In 1855, he completed the restoration, begun in 1845, of the stained glass windows of the Sainte-Chapelle, and in 1862 he declared it a national historical monument. He also began restoration programs of the medieval walls of the Cité de Carcassonne and other sites. Viollet-le-Duc's restoration was criticized in the late 20th century for sometimes pursuing the spirit of the original work, rather than strict accuracy (for example, by using a type of Gothic tower cap from northern France for the walls of the Cité de Carcassonne, rather than a tower design from that region), but in Carcassonne and other cases the works would have been destroyed entirely without the intervention of Napoleon III and Viollet-le-Duc. Landscape design Bois de Boulogne.jpegThe Bois de Boulogne, built between 1852 and 1858, was designed to give a place for relaxation and recreation to all the classes of Parisians.

Haussmann assembled a remarkable team: Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, the city's first Director of the new Service of Promenades and Plantations; Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, the city's first gardener-in-chief; Eugène Belgrand, a hydraulic engineer who rebuilt the city's sewers and water supply, and provided the water needed for the parks; and Gabriel Davioud, the city's chief architect, who designed chalets, temples, grottos, follies, fences, gates, lodges, lampposts and other park architecture.De Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, pp. 21–29. Over the course of seventeen years, Napoleon III, Haussmann and Alphand created 1,835 hectares of new parks and gardens, and planted more than six hundred thousand trees, the greatest expansion of Paris green space before or since. They built four major parks in the north, south, east and west of the city, replanted and renovated the historic parks, and added dozens of small squares and gardens, so that no one lived more than ten minutes from a park or square. In addition, they planted tens of thousands of trees along the new boulevards that Haussmann created, reaching out from the center to the outer neighborhoods. The parks of Paris, provided entertainment and relaxation for all classes of Parisians during the Second Empire. The Napoleon III style of landscape design for urban parks was very influential outside of France. The American landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted had a map of the Bois de Boulogne on the wall of his office. Central Park in New York City and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco both show the influence of the Napoleon III parks.

His favorite artists included Alexandre Cabanel, Ernest Meissonier, Jean-Léon Gérôme, and William-Adolphe Bouguereau who received important commissions. Ingres near the end of his life, was also still an important figure in both portrait and history painting. During the Second Empire, the Paris Salon was the most important event of the year for painters, engravers and sculptors. It was held every two years until 1861, and every year thereafter, in the Palais de l'Industrie, a gigantic exhibit hall built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855. A medal from the Salon assured an artist of commissions from wealthy patrons or from the French government. Following rules of the Académie des Beaux-Arts established in the 18th century, a hierarchy of genres of paintings was followed: at the highest level was history painting, followed in order by portrait painting, landscape painting, and genre painting, with still-life painting at the bottom. Painters devoted great effort and intrigue to win approval from the jury to present their paintings at the Salon and arrange for good placement in the exhibit halls.Maneglier, Hervé, Paris Impérial, pp 173-174. The Paris Salon was directed by the Count Émilien de Nieuwerkerke, the Superintendent of Fine Arts, who was known for his conservative tastes. He was scornful of the new school of Realist painters led by Gustave Courbet. In 1863, the jury of the Paris Salon refused all submissions by avant-garde artists, including those by Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro and Johan Jongkind. The artists and their friends complained, and the complaints reached Napoleon III. His office issued a statement: \\"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.\\"Published in Le Moniteur on 24 April 1863. Cited in Maneglier, Hervé, Paris Impérial — La vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire, p. 173 Following Napoleon's decree, an exhibit of the rejected paintings, called the Salon des Refusés, was held in another part of the Palace of Industry, where the Salon took place. More than a thousand visitors a day came to see now-famous paintings as Édouard Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe and James McNeill Whistler's Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl.Meneglier, Hervé, Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire The journalist Émile Zola reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter and mocking comments of many of the spectators. While the paintings were ridiculed by many critics and visitors, the work of the avant- garde became known for the first time to the French public, and it took its place alongside the more traditional style of painting.Meneglier, Hervé, Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire, Éditions Armand Colin, (1990). p. 173 The government of Napoleon III also commissioned artists to produce decorative works for public buildings. Ingres was commissioned to paint the ceiling of the main salon of the Hotel de Ville of Paris with the Apotheosis of Napoleon, the Emperor's uncle. (The painting was destroyed in 1871 when the building was set afire by the Paris Commune.) Napoleon III named Ingres a Grand Officer of the Légion d'honneur. In 1862 he was awarded the title of Senator, and made a member of the Imperial Council on Public Instruction. Delacroix also received important official commissions. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on frescoes for the Chapelle des Anges at the Church of St. Sulpice in Paris. They included \\"The Battle of Jacob with the Angel\\", \\"Saint Michael Slaying the Dragon\\", and \\"The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple\\". Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot began his career with study at the École des Beaux-Arts as an academic painter, but gradually began painting more freely and expressing emotions and feelings through his landscapes. His motto was \\"never lose that first impression which we feel.\\" He made sketches in the forests around Paris, then reworked them into final paintings in his studio. He was showing paintings in the Salon as early as 1827, but he did not achieve real fame and critical acclaim before 1855, during the Second Empire.Le Petit Robert (1988) Birth of a new art movement Gustave Courbet 027.jpgGustave Courbet's painting of ordinary young women taking a nap by the Seine (1856) caused a scandal at the Paris Salon, much to the delight of the artist.

Gustave Courbet (1819–1872) was the leader of the school of realist painters during the Second Empire who depicted the lives of ordinary people and rural life, as well as landscapes. He delighted in scandal and condemned the art establishment, the Academy of Fine Arts, and Napoleon III. In 1855, when his submissions to the Salon were rejected, he put on his own exhibit of forty of his paintings in a nearby building. In 1870, Napoleon III proposed giving the Legion of Honour to Courbet, but Courbet disdainfully rejected the offer. The term Impressionist was not invented until 1874, but during the Second Empire, all the major impressionist painters were at work in Paris, inventing their own personal styles. Claude Monet exhibited two of his paintings, a landscape and portrait of his future wife Camille Doncieux, at the Paris Salon of 1866. A major decorative painter whose career was launched under Napoleon III was Puvis de Chavannes. He became known in the Paris in the Belle Époque for his murals in the Paris Panthéon, the Sorbonne and the Paris Hotel de Ville. Edgar Degas (1834–1917), the son of a banker, studied academic art at the École des Beaux-Arts and travelled to Italy to study the Renaissance painters. In 1868, he began to frequent the Café Guerbois, where he met Manet, Monet, Renoir and the other artists of a new, more natural school, and began to develop his own style.Article on Degas, the Petit Robert, p. 504-505.

South façade of the Pavillon de Flore, Louvre Palace, Paris The most prominent sculptor of the reign of Napoleon III was Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, who contributed to the decoration of several Napoleon III landmarks, including the façade of the Opéra Garnier and the new additions to the Louvre. His style perfectly complemented the historical styles, but was original and bold enough to stand on its own. Born in Valenciennes, Nord, son of a mason, his early studies were under François Rude. Carpeaux entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1844 and won the Prix de Rome in 1854, and moving to Rome to find inspiration, he there studied the works of Michelangelo, Donatello and Verrocchio. Staying in Rome from 1854 to 1861, he obtained a taste for movement and spontaneity, which he joined with the great principles of baroque art. Carpeaux sought real life subjects in the streets and broke with the classical tradition. His sculpture La Danse for the façade of the Paris Opera (1869) caused a scandal when it was installed, because of the flamboyant pose of the nude figures.Kjellberg, Pierre (1994). Bronzes of the 19th Century (First ed.). Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. p. 174. A young new sculptor, Auguste Rodin, attempted to break into the sculptural profession during the Second Empire, with no success; he applied three times to the École des Beaux- Arts, but was rejected each time.

It emerged not from the classical opera, but from the comic opera and vaudeville, which were very popular at the time. Its characteristics were a light subject, an abundance of amusement and comedy, spoken dialogue mixed with songs and instrumental music. The first works were staged in 1848 by August Florimond Ronger, better known as Hervé. The works of Hervé included Latrouillatt and Truffaldini, or the inconveniences of a vendetta infinitely prolonged too long and Agamemnon, or the Camel with Two Humps. The early works were limited to two performers on the stage at a time, and usually were no longer than a single act. After 1858, they became longer and more elaborate, with larger casts and several acts, and took the name first of operas bouffes, then operettas. Hervé opened his own theater, the Folies Concertantes on the Boulevard du Temple, the main theater district of Paris, and they were also staged at other theatres around the city. A new composer, Jacques Offenbach, soon emerged to challenge Hervé. Born in Germany, Offenbach was first a cello player with the orchestra of the Opéra-Comique, then the conductor of the orchestra for the Comédie-Française, composing music performed between the acts. In 1853, he wrote a short musical scene performed between acts, then a more ambitious short comedy, Pepito, for the Théâtre des Variétés. He was unable to have his work performed in the major theaters, so he tried a different approach. In 1855, taking advantage of the first Paris International Exposition, which brought enormous crowds to the city, he rented a theater on the Champs-Élysées and put on his musicals to full houses. He then opened up a new theater, the Bouffes-Parisiens, which opened in 1855 with a work called Ba-ta-clan, a Chinese-style Musical. Offenbach's theater attracted not only the working and middle class audiences, the traditional audience of the music halls, but also the upper classes. The comic opera scenes alternated with musical interludes by Rossini, Mozart, and Pergolese. In 1858 he took a step further with his first full-length operetta, with four acts and a chorus, Orpheus in the Underworld. It was a popular and critical triumph, playing for two hundred twenty-eight nights. After the final night, Napoleon III granted Offenbach French citizenship, and his name changed formally from Jacob to Jacques. Verdi and Wagner Grand opera and other musical genres also flourished under Napoleon III. The construction of the railroad stations in Paris brought thousands of tourists from around France and Europe to the city, and increased the demand for music and entertainment. Operas and musicals could play to larger houses, and play for much longer. The old theaters on the \\"Boulevard of Crime\\" were demolished to make way for a new boulevard, but larger new theaters were constructed in the center of the city. Verdi signed a contract in 1852 to create a new work for the Paris Opera, in collaboration with Eugène Scribe. The result was Les vêpres siciliennes. Verdi complained that the Paris orchestra and chorus were unruly and undisciplined, and rehearsed them an unheard-of one hundred and sixty-one times before he felt they were ready. His work was rewarded; the opera was a critical and popular success, performed 150 times, rather than the originally proposed forty performances. He was unhappy, however, that his operas were less successful in Paris than those of his chief rival, Meyerbeer; he returned to Italy and did not come back for several years. He was persuaded to return to stage Don Carlos, commissioned especially for the Paris Opera. Once again he ran into troubles; one singer took him to court over the casting, and rivalries between other singers poisoned the production. He wrote afterwards, \\"I am not a composer for Paris I believe in inspiration; others only care about how the pieces are put together\\".Cited in Vila (2007), pages 187-190 Napoleon III intervened personally to have Richard Wagner come back to Paris; Wagner rehearsed the orchestra sixty-three times for the first French production of Tannhäuser on March 13, 1861. Unfortunately, Wagner was unpopular with both the French critics and with the members of the Jockey Club, an influential French social society. During the premiere, with Wagner in the audience, the Jockey Club members whistled and jeered from the first notes of the Overture. After just three performances, the Opera was pulled from the repertoire. Wagner got his revenge in 1870, when the Prussian Army captured Napoleon III and surrounded Paris; he wrote a special piece of music to celebrate the event, \\"Ode to the German Army at Paris\\".Maneglier, Hervé, Paris Impérial, p. 188. During the Second Empire, before the contraction of the Opéra Garnier, Paris had three major opera houses: The Salle Le Pelletier, where the Emperor barely escaped a terrorist bomb in 1858; the Théâtre Lyrique; and Les Italiens, where only Italian works were presented, in Italian. The major French composers of the period included Charles Gounod, Hector Berlioz, and Félicien David, and Gabriel Fauré. The new French opera: Gounod and Bizet While Verdi and Wagner certainly attracted the most attention, young new French composers were also striving to win attention. Charles Gounod wrote his first opera, Sapho, in 1851 at the urging of his friend, the singer Pauline Viardot; it was a commercial failure. He had no great theatrical success until Faust, derived from Goethe, which premiered at the Théâtre Lyrique in 1859. This remains the composition for which he is best known; and although it took a while to achieve popularity, it became one of the most frequently staged operas of all time, with no fewer than 2,000 performances of the work having occurred by 1975 at the Paris Opéra alone.Giroud, V. French Opera: A Short History. Yale University Press, 2010. Georges Bizet wrote his first opera, Les pêcheurs de perles, for the Théâtre Lyrique company. It had its first performance on 30 September 1863. Critical opinion was generally hostile, though Berlioz praised the work, writing that it \\"does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\".Curtiss, pp. 140–41 Public reaction was lukewarm, and the opera's run ended after 18 performances. It was not performed again until 1886. Bizet did not have a major success until Carmen in 1875. He died after the thirty-third performance. Carmen went on to become one of the most performed operas of all time.Dean (1980), pp. 755–56 Popular music The styles of popular music also evolved under Napoleon III. The café-concert or café-concert was a Paris institution, with at least one in every neighborhood. They ranged from a single singer with a piano to elegant cafes with orchestras. A city ordinance, designed to protect the traditional musical theaters, forbid the performers in cafés from wearing costumes, dancing, or pantomime, or the use of sets or scenery; they were also forbidden to sing more than forty songs in an evening, and had to present the program in advance each day. This law was challenged by one café-concert owner, who hired a former actress from the Comédie-Française to perform scenes of classic plays in costume. The law was revised in 1867, which opened the way to an entirely new institution in Paris, the music hall, with comedy, sets, and costumed singers and dancers. For the first time, the profession of singer was given formal status, and for the first time composers could seek royalties for the performance of their songs.

It was founded in 1191 and abandoned after less than twenty years; some of the community went on to establish Ryd Abbey.  History  Guldholm was located on a peninsula of land in the Langsee lake () near the Schlei () owned by Bishop Valdemar (1158-1236), an illegitimate son of King Canute V of Denmark, and Bishop of Schleswig from 1184 to 1191. When he received reports of immorality, drunkenness and disorderly conduct at St. Michael's Abbey in Schleswig, an ancient Benedictine double monastery, his solution was to remove the monks to a remote and less comfortable location, for which Guldholm seemed highly suitable. The monks were therefore apparently transferred there in 1191 to begin work on a new monastery which at the same time was put under the new and strict Cistercian reform, with its emphasis on manual labour. Bishop Valdemar however was imprisoned in 1193 after a failed attempt to oust Duke Valdemar (later King Valdemar II) of Denmark. Without his supervision the new foundation at Guldholm was abandoned after a few years. The remains of the community went north to the banks of the Flensborg Fjord near the hamlet of Ryd and began work on a new Cistercian monastery, Ryd Abbey ( Ryd Kloster) in 1210.

It was held in Salt Lake City between 1888 and 1975, and included cultural festivals, training, and speeches by church leaders.  Format  June Conference was held over three days. Youth planned and participated in workshops about ideas for teaching youth, as well as music, dancing, exhibits, and skits, often pertaining to a conference theme. There were also music and art festivals, banquets, camp activities, testimony meetings, and programs for both youth and parents. Youth leaders received training and learned the youth theme and program for the next year. Youth programs were often on break during summer, allowing some preparation before resuming in September. The all-Church dance festival was held at the University of Utah stadium. The First Presidency and other General Authorities would speak at two general sessions of talks, including discussion of new youth programs.  History  The first annual June Conference was held in 1888, replacing training conferences for YLMIA (later called the Young Women organization) that had been held at the time of general conference. Leaders gave training workshops in teacher improvement, music, activities, and story-telling. In 1896 the YMMIA (later called the Young Men organization) joined in the event. Early features Starting in 1904, the conference also included an athletic field day for various sports. In 1911 Field Day was incorporated into the conference activities, organizing outdoor games and sports. At the 1929 conference, a girl's summer camping program was launched, along with a unified magazine for both young men and young women. The conference was also known for its large dance festivals with up to 2000 participants, introduced in 1936. These large festivals would rival even the all-Church athletic competitions. These large- scale productions were the highlight for the year for the church's youth programs. At a time when nearly all LDS stakes were in the United States, about 80 percent of them sent representatives to June Conference in Salt Lake City. Post-war growth Over the years the conference continued to adapt and expand. During World War II, when gas-rationing limited travel, the conference was suspended, resuming in 1945. In 1946 a dance festival of three thousand celebrated the war's end. The following year, at the 1947 Utah pioneer centennial, the dance festival was moved to the University of Utah's stadium to accommodate the size of the event. In 1952, 30,000 spectators (thousands having been turned away) saw traditional, western, and Maori dances in the two-hour program. The music festival in 1949 was unusually large, with three thousand singers joining in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. To spare the growing Latter-day Saint population in California from traveling to Utah, similar conferences for youth were held in August in Los Angeles, from 1954-57. The June Conference in 1969 was known for its elaborate events, international representatives, and debut of the film Pioneers in Petticoats, in honor of the YWMIA centennial. Correlation changes In 1971, the large-dance festival was replaced by regional festivals, with the June Conference festival limited to participants from Salt Lake City, and all- church athletic competitions were disbanded. As the church restructured its programs through correlation, the June Conference became a priesthood conference in 1973, integrating young men of the Aaronic priesthood with church president Harold B. Lee conducting. Last conference The final June Conference was held in 1975, at a time when the LDS Church was modernizing its growing, and increasingly international, auxiliaries. One year prior, in June 1974, annual churchwide conferences for the Primary, Sunday School, and Relief Society had also been discontinued. During this last conference, church president Spencer W. Kimball announced the conference would end as the church, experiencing increasing international growth, moved to decentralize. He emphasized that church leaders were realizing “the impracticality of concentrating our activities and learning processes in the headquarters center only.” Training and cultural activities for youth that the June Conference had once provided were instead to be conducted by local and regional church organizations. In part, this was also to encourage self- reliance and leadership within local areas. The next year, in summer 1976, BYU began the first annual Especially For Youth (EFY) event, intended to be like BYU Education Week for youth, where attendees could meet other youth from throughout the church, rather than just those at a local youth conference.

World War II With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Saalwächter received command of Marine-Gruppenkommando West and was responsible for operations in the North Sea, which led to disputes between himself and the fleet commanders, Vice Admirals Hermann Boehm, Wilhelm Marschall, and Günther Lütjens.

Information Mantra Sunrise was a progressive rock band that performed and recorded in the early 1990s. The band's power trio format featured vocalist and bass guitarist Joel Bissing, guitarist John Miner, and Wayne Garabedian, who doubled on drums and keyboards. Their self-titled debut album was recorded during 1992 and 1993 in a converted farmhouse in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Seven years later the album was released on the Las Vegas-based Tributary Music Label in 2000. The twenty-minute epic \\"Land of Sprinagar\\" became a favorite of late night progressive rock radio shows.

Miner's compositions were based for the most part on alternate tunings and the use of odd time signatures, a direction Miner would continue to explore further in years to come, particularly in his work with Art Rock Circus. Garabedian found Bissing in a coffee shop in Fresno, California and arranged an audition with Miner upon his return to California. Bissing gave the music a unique voice, a stylistic approach on bass guitar, and also made significant contributions as a songwriter on their album. The group expanded their live shows by featuring special guests performing on violin and flute. The band also incorporated elements of modern dance and eastern belly dancing at their shows. Visual elements were aided by stage smoke, slide shows and other psychedelic special lighting effects. Mantra's sophisticated staging did find its critics within the grunge movement that favored a more stripped down, no nonsense approach to live music in the early 1990s. Unfinished recordings  The band had plans to record a follow-up concept album with some tracks recorded in Seattle by Bissing and Miner, but the band was not able to finish the recording due to management and logistical problems. Another aborted attempt to revive the project with Art Rock Circus drummer Nolan Stolz fell through in 2002 in Las Vegas where Miner was working on his rock opera Heavens Cafe. The future of the follow-up album is still in question to this day.

Katz attended Burlington County College and graduated from Rutgers University with a bachelor's degree in labor studies in 1981. In 1995, she received a master's degree from Rutgers in labor and employment relations. A year after graduating from Rutgers, she started as an organizer for the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and rose through the ranks to become president of Local 1034 in 1999. Local 1034 was CWA's largest local union in the country with more than 16,000 members in both the public and private sector. Katz served as a Commissioner of the Public Employment Relations Commission for five years on an appointment by Governor Donald DiFrancesco. Katz enrolled at Seton Hall University School of Law in 2004 and graduated with a juris doctor four years later. She has been a visiting part- time lecturer at Rutgers and contributes to the \\"NJ Voices\\" blog on NJ.com. In May 2009, the radio station WKXW (101.5 FM) announced that Katz would join the afternoon drive show \\"The Jersey Guys\\" in a series of appearances. In March 2010, Katz joined the Livingston, New Jersey law firm Fox & Fox LLP. She was \\"of counsel\\" to the firm, specializing in labor law. Katz has two children, Montana and Cooper McKim, with her ex-husband Larry McKim, a New Jersey artist. Relationship with Jon Corzine Katz first met Jon Corzine in the spring of 1999, when he was running for the United States Senate. As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the job offer.Adams, Cindy. \\"Jon's Ex Tells All\\" , New York Post, June 6, 2007. Accessed May 31, 2008. Corzine and Katz were soon dating, appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's separation from his wife Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) Katz and Corzine lived together in Hoboken from April 2002 until their breakup in August 2004.

Corzine forgave a $470,000 mortgage on this house in Alexandria Township, N.J., owned by Carla Katz.\\" Corzine was sworn in as governor in January 2006 and maintained a close friendship with Katz. A state ethics panel, responding to a complaint from Republican Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's personal contact with Corzine during labor negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct. Separately, New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Tom Wilson filed a lawsuit to release all e-mail correspondence between Corzine and Katz during the contract negotiations. On May 30, 2008, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Paul Innes ruled that at least 745 pages of e-mail records should be made public, but Corzine's lawyers immediately appealed the decision. Corzine won his case on appeal, and on March 18, 2009, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that it would not hear arguments in the case, effectively ending the legal battle to make his e-mails with Katz public.

It was formed by the Spelga Dam and sits at over above sea level. It has a volume of 2,700,000 cubic metres and a catchment area of 5.423 km². It occupies an area known as Deers Meadow, and impounds the River Bann, which rises on the nearby Slieve Muck. The reservoir and dam were built as part of a project that had origins in the idea of supplying water to Belfast, in 1894. The Spelga Reservoir itself was developed between 1953 and 1957. As part of the construction, the B27 road was rebuilt above the reservoir to replace the original road submerged by the construction. The Dam was designed by the Belfast engineering firm of R. Ferguson and S. McIlveen and construction was undertaken by John Laing & Sons.Ritchie, p. 126 The Portadown and Banbridge areas receive their water supply from the reservoir. Whilst it has not been stocked with fish for some years, it is home to wild trout. In 2018 and again in 2020, heatwaves and dry weather caused the water level to drop. This exposed a portion of the original road through the Deers Meadow, including a bridge which was formerly the first bridge on the River Bann.

Jacob was the son of Jacob van Breda, a Dutch physician, physicist and politician, and Anna Elsenera van Campen. His mother died when he was two years old. He studied medicine and physics at the University of Leyden, where he obtained his degree in medicine and philosophy in 1811, afterwards he travelled to Paris. In 1816 he became professor of botany, chemistry and pharmacy at the University of Franeker. In this period he benefitted from the newly peaceful conditions in Europe by visiting places of scientific interest to him, e.g. in Germany. At Franeker he became close personal friends with one of the curators, the Dutch lawyer, administrator and politician Squire Adriaan Gillis Camper, himself the son of professor of anatomy Petrus Camper. On 9 May 1821 he married in Klein Lankum with Camper's third child and second daughter Frederika Theodora Ernestina Camper (1799-1834), who was herself an amateur-scientist who accompanied him on voyages to Georges Cuvier in France and Humphry Davy in England; she made drawings of his specimens. All children from their marriage would be stillborn. In 1822, Van Breda became professor of botany, zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Ghent. Here he was head of the local hortus botanicus and in 1825 commenced a major botanical work, the Genera et Species Orchidearum et Asclepiadearum, in fifteen tomes describing plant genera from the Dutch Indies shipped to him from Batavia; but he had to abandon this project and his position in 1830 because of the Belgian Revolution. In 1825 he had also written a biography of his deceased father-in- law: Levens-schets van Adriaan Gilles Camper. In 1831 Van Breda became extraordinary professor of zoology and geology at Leyden. After his wife died on 15 April 1834, he remarried in 1836, to Cornelia Maria Veeren. They had two daughters, Jacoba Frederica and Maria Jacoba Petronella. In 1835 he became ordinary professor at Leyden. As a geologist, Van Breda was a follower of uniformitarianism. In 1839 he moved to Haarlem where he was appointed secretary of the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen (Hollandic Society of the Sciences) — in which capacity he launched over 400 essay competitions — and head of both the Palaeontological & Mineralogical and the Physics Cabinet of the Teylers Museum. In the latter function he researched in the field of magnetism and electricity and also bought many fossils, among them the Haarlem specimen of Archaeopteryx. From 1852 to 1855 on orders of Thorbecke he was the president of a commission having to prepare the creation of the first comprehensive geological map of The Netherlands; from 1826 to 1830 he had already obtained some experience in this field when making a geological map of the Southern Netherlands (i.e. the later Belgium). The later project largely failed, however. In 1857 he retired from his position at Leyden and in 1864 from his functions in Haarlem, dying from a stroke in 1867. His successor as curator of geology, paleontology and mineralogy at Teylers Museum was Tiberius Cornelis Winkler, who had produced the first Dutch translation of Darwin's Origin of Species in 1860. Van Breda also had an extensive personal geological and paleontological collection, of about 1900 pieces, which in 1871 was sold to the University of Cambridge and the British Museum of Natural History; in 1883 one of the fossils was named in honour of Van Breda: Megalosaurus bredai, later made the type species of the dinosaur Betasuchus. Some archaeological items entered the collections of the British Museum. References *C.J. Matthes, \\"Levensberigt van J. G.

She is best known as a co-founder (in 1921) of International PEN, a worldwide association of writers. In her later years she became a keen spiritualist.Kemp, Sandra; Mitchell, Charlotte; Trotter, David. (1997). Edwardian Fiction: An Oxford Companion. Oxford University Press. p. 92 Background and education Born to Ebenezer Dawson, a brick manufacturer and his wife Catherine Armstrong. Her sister, Ellen M. Dawson, was born about 1868. Henry Dawson Lowry (Cornwall) was her cousin. Catherine Amy's mother died in January 1877, when the girl was 11 and her younger sister 7. In 1878, their father remarried and by 1881, the girls and their stepmother were living or staying with her widowed mother, Sarah Ancell, in Camberwell, where Catherine A. Dawson graduated from Anglo German College. Career At 18, she began working as a secretary, while also writing. Her \\"Charades For Home Acting\\" (44 pp.) was published by Woodford Fawcett and Co. in 1888. \\"Sappho\\", an epic poem 210 pages long, was published by Kegan Paul, Trench and Co. in 1889, at her own expense. She followed with \\"Idylls of Womanhood\\", a collection of poems published by William Heinemann in 1892. She did not marry until she was 33, to a medical doctor Horatio Francis Ninian Scott. They lived in London (Hanover Square), where their first child, Marjorie Catharine Waiora Scott, was born in 1899, then a son, Horatio Christopher L. Scott, in March 1901. Then the family moved to West Cowes on the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1902, where they lived for the next seven years. Another child, Edward Walter Lucas Scott, nicknamed Toby, was born in June 1904. Mrs. Dawson Scott, freed from daily household duties after the birth of the third child, found country life stifling and missed literary London. She started writing again and in 1906, at 41, published her first novel \\"The Story of Anna Beames\\" under a pen name of Mrs. Sappho. Two years later came her second novel, \\"The Burden\\", now using the name C.A. Dawson Scott. She produced seven more books in six years until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, including in 1909 \\"Treasure Trove\\", \\"The Agony Column\\", and in 1910 \\"Madcap Jane\\". Then in 1910, the Scott family moved back closer to London and Mrs Dawson Scott could join London's literary circle, now an author with a few publications to her name. A few more came: \\"Mrs Noakes, An Ordinary Woman\\" and a guide (with map) called \\"Nooks And Corners of Cornwall\\" in 1911. In 1912 Mrs Dawson-Scott met poet Charlotte Mary Mew, who supposedly had read her \\"Macap Jane\\". In the summer of 1913, Catherine Dawson-Scott asked Charlotte Mew to her home in Southall to recite a few poems to a small group of acquaintances — but the self-conscious poet only consented a year later, and the reading on 16 March 1914 was a great success, the mystic poet Evelyn Underhill apparently getting journalist and critic Rolfe Scott-James, then the time editor of the highly regarded New Weekly, interested in Mew, as her ‘Fame’ did appear in the magazine in May — only two months after her reading. At that time, Dawson-Scott was also engaged in, or had just finished, editing the poems of her deceased cousin, Henry Dawson Lowry, and writing her own poems. When World War I broke out, her husband was enlisted into the Royal Army Medical Corps and was sent to France while Catherine A., with the support of the British secretary of state for war Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener, is credited with the creation of the Women's Defence Relief Corps in late August 1914. The corps was made up of two divisions: civil section, to substitute women for men in factories and other places of employment in order to free those men for military service; and a “semi-military” or “good citizen” section, for active recruitment of women for the armed forces, to be trained in drilling, marching and the use of arms so they could protect themselves and their loved ones on the home front in case of enemy invasion. In effect, in the spring of 1915 members of the Corp started working on the land, and in 1916, 465 women were organized in squads for land work, to be exploited as casual labor. Later, her husband began to suffer from depression and eventually they divorced. Dr Scott reportedly went on to commit suicide. In the spring of 1917, Dawson Scott started the To- Morrow Club, a predecessor to the later International PEN Club. The name indicated that aim of the club: to draw the writers of “tomorrow”, the “literary youth” and connect them with the established writers for the purpose of exchanging ideas, advice, and comments. Dawson-Scott would sometimes invite the literary agents and editors she knew to attend the Club dinners, while encouraging the young writers to seize the opportunity of meeting them. With World War I coming to an end in 1918, the weekly dinner meeting and lecture became a regular event. At the same time, Dawson-Scott did not stop writing and in the same 1918 she published her novel \\"Wastralls\\", with which she resumed putting out one book nearly every year. What Catherine A. Dawson Scott remains best known for, however, is her founding of the International PEN Club in 1921, a successor to the earlier (1917) To-morrow Club, whose purpose had been to provide a meeting place where aspiring writers might mix with established ones. PEN Club was to offer the same to the professional writers. John Galsworthy was asked to serve as PEN Club's first President and for most of the 1920s Catherine's daughter, Marjorie, served as its secretary,. PEN was a shortened acronym for Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists, and though it was intended as apolitical, both its membership and leadership has been leftist-liberal. In addition to her organizing activities, writing novels and some non-fiction, utilizing some text by Henry Dawson Lowry (her cousin), Scott adapted one of her own novels (the 1921 The Haunting) into the libretto for the opera Gale by Ethel Leginska, which premiered in Chicago at the Civic Opera House, with John Charles Thomas in the lead, on 23 November 1935. Psychical research Scott was engaged in one more area, applying her organizational skill there, as well. As she wrote in her 1926 book From Four Who Are Dead: Messages to C. A. Dawson Scott, with a foreword by May Sinclair and published by Arrowsmith, by her late thirties \\"certain small, unusual faculties had begun to develop\\" (ibid., p. 22) in her, e.g. while resting after a meal, she once noticed she could amuse herself by closing her eyes and seeing a dark tunnel which she would then explore. Then, after a woman she had known lost her husband, she believed had psychic powers to communicate with the dead, supporting this notion with the fact that her grandfather's cousin spiritualist Edmund Dawson Rogers, who helped form the British National Association of Spiritualists in 1873 and in 1881 founded the spiritualist journal Light, which he edited from 1894 until his death in 1910. In 1881-1882 he founded the Society for Psychical Research, with Sir William F. Barrett. Scott founded \\"The Survival League\\" in 1929. This spiritualist organization attempted to unite all religions to study psychical research. H. Dennis Bradley was its first chairman.Nelson, G. K. (2013 edition). Spiritualism and Society (Routledge Revivals). Routledge. p. 160. Scott wrote that \\"Many members of my family had [...] seen phantasms, and auras, had had prophetic dreams and so on.\\" (ibid., p. 22). Her venture into spiritualism resulted, in addition of the aforementioned book describing her four \\"visions\\", including that of her dead husband, in her involvement in an organization called the International Institute for Psychical Research formed in 1934 \\"for the purpose of investigating psychic phenomena on strictly scientific lines\\" and on whose Executive Committee she served as Organising Secretary. The group met for tea and to hold spiritualist seances and discuss possible methods of investigation, as well as individual cases. Works *Charades for Home Acting. (1888) *Sappho.

The Mandarin Phetracha, previously one of Narai's trusted military advisors, took advantage of the elderly Narai's illness, and killed Narai's Christian heir, along with a number of missionaries and Narai's influential foreign minister the Greek adventurer Constantine Phaulkon. Phetracha then married Narai's daughter, took the throne, and pursued a policy of ousting French influence and military forces from Siam. One of the most prominent battles was 1688's Siege of Bangkok, when tens of thousands of Siamese forces spent four months besieging a French fortress within the city. As a consequence of the revolution, Siam severed significant ties with the West, with the exception of the Dutch East India Company, until the 19th century. Foreign policy focus of King Narai Contemporary French depiction of the King Narai of Siam King Narai's reign saw a major expansion of diplomatic missions to and from Western powers, most notably France, England, and the Vatican. Missions were also sent and received from Persia, India and China, as well as other neighbouring states. Another notable feature of Narai's reign was the unprecedented influence of foreigners at the Siamese court, embodied in the meteoric rise of Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adventurer who would eventually hold the modern equivalent of the post of Prime Minister. King Narai especially sought to expand relations with the French, as a counterweight to Portuguese and Dutch influence in his kingdom, and at the suggestion of his Greek councilor Phaulkon.Wills, p. 87 Numerous embassies were exchanged in both directions.Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mission Made Impossible: The Second French Embassy to Siam, 1687, by Michael Smithies, Claude Céberet, Guy Tachard, Simon de La Loubère (2002) Silkworm Books, Thailand , p. 182 Nationalistic upheaval France sought to convert King Narai to Roman Catholicism, and also to establish troops in the area. With Narai's permission, fortresses with French troops and under French control were established at Mergui and Bangkok, in order to reaffirm the commercial treaty of 1685, provide a counterweight to Dutch influence in the region, and help to combat piracy.Wills, p. 89 This disembarkment of French troops led to strong nationalist movements in Siam. By 1688, anti-foreign sentiments, mainly directed at the French and Phaulkon, were reaching their zenith. The Siamese courtiers resented the dominance of the Greek Phaulkon in state affairs, along with his Portuguese-Japanese wife and European lifestyle, while the Buddhist clergy were uneasy with the increasing prominence of the French Jesuits. The courtiers eventually formed themselves into an anti- foreign faction. Other foreigners who had established themselves in Ayutthaya before the French, in particular the Protestant Dutch and English as well as the Muslim Persians, also resented the growing political and economic influence of the Catholic French. Other established Catholic factions, such as the Portuguese, also had reason to resent the French presence, seeing it as a violation of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The increasing French influence not only increased competition but was also an unwelcome reminder of the declining fortunes of Portugal. Matters were brought to a head when King Narai fell gravely ill in March 1688, and conspirators maneuvered to take power. In April, Phaulkon requested military help from the French in order to neutralize the plot. The French officer Desfarges responded by leading 80 troops and 10 officers out of Bangkok to the Palace in Lopburi.Vollant des Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.110 However, he stopped on the way in Ayutthaya and finally abandoned his plan and retreated to Bangkok, fearing that he could be attacked by Siamese rebels, and troubled by false rumors, some spread by Véret, the Director of the French East India Company, including one that the king had already died.Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.18 Succession crisis Krommaluang Yothathep, daughter and only child of king Narai, was named regent on May 10, 1688. On May 10, the dying King Narai, aware of the coming succession dispute, called together his closest councilors - the Greek councilor Phaulkon; the king's foster brother and Commander of the Royal Elephant Corps, Phra Phetracha; and the King's adopted son Mom Pi. Narai nominated his daughter, Krommaluang Yothathep, to succeed him. His three councilors were to act as regents until the princess took on a partner of her choice from one of the two Siamese councilors, Mom Pi or Phetracha. Far from calming the situation, Narai's decision spurred Phetracha to act. With Narai essentially incapacitated by his illness, Phetracha staged a long-planned coup d'etat with the support of a resentful court as well as the Buddhist clergy, initiating the 1688 Siamese revolution. On May 17–18, 1688, King Narai was arrested. On June 5, Phaulkon was arrested on accusations of treason, and later beheaded. Mom Pi was killed, and many members of Narai's family were assassinated. Both of the king's brothers, his successors by right, were killed on July 9,Wills, p. 92Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.46 and King Narai himself died in detention on July 10–11, with his death possibly hastened by poisoning. Phra Phetracha was crowned king on August 1.Smithies 2002, p.184 Kosa Pan, the 1686 former ambassador to France, and a strong supporter of Phetracha, became his Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.35 Princess Krommaluang Yothathep ultimately had to marry Phetracha and become his queen. Ousting of French forces (1688) Siamese attack on du Bruant in Tavoy, in which the Chevalier de Beauregard and the Jesuit Pierre d'Espagnac were captured and enslaved.Smithies 2002, p.80 Large- scale attacks were launched on the two French fortresses in Siam, and on June 24, 1688, the French under du Bruant and the Chevalier de Beauregard had to abandon their garrison at Mergui. Du Bruant managed to escape under fire and with many casualties by seizing a Siamese warship, the Mergui.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.76 He and his troops were stranded on a deserted island for four months before being captured by a British warship. They ultimately returned to Pondicherry by way of Madras. In the Siege of Bangkok, Phetracha besieged the French fortress in Bangkok with 40,000 men and over a hundred cannon, for a period of four months. The Siamese troops also apparently received Dutch support in their fight against the French.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p. 66-71 On September 9, the French warship Oriflamme, carrying 200 troops and commanded by de l'Estrilles, arrived at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River, but was unable to dock at the Bangkok fortress as the entrance to the river was being blocked by the Siamese.Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.49 Phaulkon's Catholic Japanese-Portuguese wife, Maria Guyomar de Pinha,Vollant des Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.100 who had been promised protection by being ennobled a countess of France, took refuge with the French troops in Bangkok, but Desfarges returned her to the Siamese under pressure from Phetracha on October 18.Smithies 2002, p.11/p.184 Despite the promises that had been made regarding her safety, she was condemned to perpetual slavery in the kitchens of Phetracha.Smithies 2002, p.51, note 101 Desfarges finally negotiated to return with his men to Pondicherry on November 13, on board the Oriflamme and two Siamese ships, the Siam and the Louvo, provided by Phetracha.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.73 Some of the French troops remained in Pondicherry to bolster the French presence there, but most left for France on February 16, 1689 aboard the French Navy Normande and the French Company Coche, with the engineer Vollant des Verquains and the Jesuit Le Blanc aboard. The two ships were captured by the Dutch at The Cape, however, because the War of the Augsburg League had started. After a month in the Cape, the prisoners were sent to Zeeland where they were kept at the prison of Middelburg. They were eventually able to return to France through a general exchange of prisoners.Smithies 2002, p.19 On April 10, 1689, the French officer Desfarges—who had remained in Pondicherry—led an expedition to capture the island of Phuket in an attempt to restore some sort of French control in Siam.A History of South-east Asia p. 350, by Daniel George Edward Hall (1964) St. Martin's PressDhivarat na Pombejra in Reid, p.267 The occupation of the island led nowhere, and Desfarges returned to Pondicherry in January 1690.Smithies 2002, p.185 Recalled to France, he left 108 troops in Pondicherry to bolster defenses, and left with his remaining troops on the Oriflamme and the Company ships Lonré and Saint-Nicholas on February 21, 1690.Smithies 2002, p.179 Desfarges died on his way back trying to reach Martinique, and the Oriflamme sank shortly thereafter on February 27, 1691, with most of the remaining French troops, off the coast of Britanny.Smithies 2002, p.16/p.185 A Siamese-formed rebellion led by Thammathian broke out in 1690 against Phetracha's rule, but was suppressed. The governors of several regional provinces likewise refused to accept Phetracha's rule, and stood in rebellion until 1691. Phetracha's reign lasted until 1703, when he died and was succeeded by his eldest son Sanphet VIII. A contemporary who participated in the events, the French engineer Jean Vollant des Verquains, wrote in 1691 about its historical significance: \\"The revolution which occurred in the Kingdom of Siam in the year 1688 is one of the most famous events of our times, whether it is considered from the point of view of politics or religion.\\"Jean Vollant des Verquains, History of the revolution in Siam in the year 1688, in Smithies 2002, p. 98 Aftermath Kosa Pan, former ambassador to France in 1686, became the new Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade after the revolution, under the new ruler Phetracha. France was unable to stage a comeback or organize a retaliation due to its involvement in major European conflicts: the War of the League of Augsburg (1688–1697), and then the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1713/1714). In Siam, Phetracha had managed to expel most of the French from the country, but after an initial confinement, missionaries were allowed to continue their work in Ayutthaya, albeit with some restrictions. The Bishop of Ayutthaya Monseigneur Louis Laneau was only released from jail in April 1691. A few French employees of the king, such as René Charbonneau, former governor of Phuket, were also allowed to remain. Not all contacts with the West were severed however. On November 14, immediately after the French retreat, the 1644 Treaty and Alliance of Peace between Siam and the Dutch East India Company was renewed, guaranteeing the Dutch their previously agreed deerskin export monopoly, and giving them freedom to trade freely in Siamese ports. They also obtained a renewal of their export monopoly on Ligor for tin (originally granted by king Narai in 1671).Dhivarat na Pombejra in Reid, p.265 Dutch factors (Opperhoofden) were also stationed at Ayutthaya, such as Pieter van den Hoorn (from 1688 to 1691), or Thomas van Son (from 1692 to 1697).Dhiravat na Pombejra, in Reid p.265-266 Contact between Siam and the West remained sporadic, however, and would not return to the level seen in the reign of King Narai until the reign of King Mongkut in the mid-19th century.Background Note: Thailand, US Department of State: Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, March 2008 Western contacts aside, trade relations with Asian countries remained buoyant, with Siam remaining especially involved in the Sino-Siamese-Japanese trade. During the reign of Phetracha, about 50 Chinese junks are recorded to have visited Ayutthaya, and during the same period as many as 30 junks left Ayutthaya for Nagasaki, Japan.Dhivarat na Pombejra in Reid, p.266 The official resumption of contacts with the West started with the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United Kingdom in 1826. Diplomatic exchanges with the United States started in 1833.US Department of State France did not resume official contacts until 1856, when Napoleon III sent an embassy to King Mongkut led by Charles de Montigny. A Treaty was signed on August 15, 1856 to facilitate trade, guarantee religious freedom, and allow the access of French warships to Bangkok. In June 1861, French warships brought a Thai embassy to France, led by Phya Sripipat (Pae Bunnag).Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notes References * Hall, Daniel George Edward (1964) A History of South-east Asia St. Martin's Press * Reid, Anthony (Editor), Southeast Asia in the Early Modern Era, Cornell University Press, 1993, * Smithies, Michael (1999), A Siamese embassy lost in Africa 1686, Silkworm Books, Bangkok, * Smithies, Michael (2002), Three military accounts of the 1688 \\"Revolution\\" in Siam, Itineria Asiatica, Orchid Press, Bangkok, * Stearn, Duncan.

During the War of 1812, he volunteered during the summer of 1813, and served on the northern frontier in the winter campaign under general Wade Hampton. The next summer he was stationed at Brooklyn Heights, near New York City. After the war ended, Myers farmed and engaged in mercantile pursuits. In 1823 or 1825, he became collector of tolls at Schenectady on the new Erie Canal, until 1836, when he moved to Toledo, Ohio. In Toledo, Myers became involved with the construction of the Miami and Erie Canal. After completion of the canal, he concentrated on property management and real estate. He was elected to two terms under Ohio's first constitution to the Ohio State Senate, to represent much of Northwest Ohio starting in 1848. Under the new constitution, he served a single term as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio as a Democrat. He was in feeble health beginning in the mid-1850s, but served a two-year term as a representative from Lucas County in the Ohio House of Representatives during the American Civil War, after nomination by the Union convention. Myers' health further declined, and after much pain, he died July 19, 1864 at his home, northwest corner of Jefferson and Superior Streets, Toledo.

Control of the Menai and access to Anglesey (Ynys Môn) was crucial for medieval Gwynedd The history of Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages is a period in the History of Wales spanning the 11th through the 13th centuries. Gwynedd, located in the north of Wales, eventually became the most dominant of Welsh principalities during this period. Distinctive achievements in Gwynedd include further development of Medieval Welsh literature, particularly poets known as the Beirdd y Tywysogion (Welsh for Poets of the Princes) associated with the court of Gwynedd; the reformation of bardic schools; and the continued development of Cyfraith Hywel (The Law of Hywel, or Welsh law). All three of these further contributed to the development of a Welsh national identity in the face of Anglo-Norman encroachment of Wales. Gwynedd's traditional territory included Anglesey (Ynys Môn) and all of north Wales between the River Dyfi in the south and River Dee (Welsh Dyfrdwy) in the northeast.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, foundations of pgs 50–51, 54–55 The Irish Sea (Môr Iwerddon) lies to the north and west, and lands formerly part of the Powys border the south-east. Gwynedd's strength was due in part to the region's mountainous geography which made it difficult for foreign invaders to campaign in the country and impose their will effectively.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Recovers Gwynedd, Norman invasion, Battle of Anglesey Sound, pgs 21–22, 36, 39, 40, later years 76–77 Gwynedd emerged from the Early Middle Ages having suffered from increasing Viking raids and various occupations by rival Welsh princes, causing political and social upheaval. With the historic Aberffraw family displaced, by the mid 11th century Gwynedd was united with the rest of Wales by the conquest of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, followed by the Norman invasions between 1067 and 1100. After the restoration of the Aberffraw family in Gwynedd, a series of successful rulers such as Gruffudd ap Cynan, Owain Gwynedd, Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd led to the emergence of the Principality of Wales, based in Gwynedd.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, \\"[Llywelyn's territory had become] a virtual principality of Wales\\", page 222. The emergence of the principality in the 13th century was proof that all the elements necessary for the growth of Welsh statehood independent of England were in place.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, emerging defacto statehood pg 148. As part of the Principality of Wales, Gwynedd would retain Welsh laws and customs and home rule until the Edwardian Conquest of Wales of 1282. History  11th century  =Norse raids; Aberffraw dispossessed= Map of the extent of Maredudd ab Owain's Conquest The latter part of the 10th century, and the whole of the 11th century, was an exceptionally tumultuous period for the Gwyneddwyr, Gwynedd's Welsh populace.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Tumultuous century, Meredudd ab Owain, Viking raids of, Anglesey name origin pg 98, 99; Deheubarth's ruler Maredudd ab Owain deposed Gwynedd's ruler Cadwallon ab Ieuaf of the House of Aberffraw in 986, annexing Gwynedd to his enlarged domain, which came to include most of Wales. The Hiberno-Norse from Dublin and the Isle of Man routinely raided the coasts of Wales, with the Welsh people of Ynys Môn and the Llŷn Peninsula suffering the most in Gwynedd. In 987 a Norse raiding party landed on Môn and captured as many as two thousand of the island's residents, selling them as slaves across northern Europe. Historian and author Dr. John Davies argues that it is during this period that the Norse name for Môn, Anglesey, came into existence; it was later adopted into English.Anglesey from Ongle's ey, or Ongle's Island. http://www.anglesey-history.co.uk/ In 989 Meredudd ab Owain bribed the Norse not to raid that year. However the Norse resumed significant raids on Môn in 993, as well as on other parts of Wales for the remainder of the century. In 999 Meredudd ab Owain of Deheubarth died, and Cynan ap Hywel was able to wrestle back Gwynedd for the Aberffraw dynasty.Lloyd, J.E. A history of Wales: from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest Cynan ap Hywel, Aeddan ap Blegywryd, However, Cynan himself was deposed by Aeddan ap Blegywryd in 1005. Aeddan was not himself connected to the Aberffraw family, and was perhaps a minor commote lord. Aeddan ruled Gwynedd until 1018, when he and his four sons were defeated in battle by Llywelyn ap Seisyll, lord of Rhuddlan in lower Gwynedd.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Llywelyn ap Seisyll, virtually nothing known of..., married Anghared ferch Meredudd, Iago ab Idwal, Gruffudd kills Iago ab Idwal and takes Gwynedd and Powys pages 99,100Little is known of the ancestry of Llywelyn ap Seisyll, with later genealogists suggesting he was descended from a younger son of Anarawd ap Rhodri, which would make him a member of the Aberffraw house. However, this may be a genealogical construct to legitimize his son Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's rule of Gwynedd later in the 11th century.There is general consensus from the strong association of Llywelyn ap Seisyll and his son Gruffydd ap Llywelyn with the commote of Rhuddlan, that they may have been of the ruling family of the Rhuddlan commote. Llywelyn ap Seisyll married Anghared, daughter of Meredudd ab Owain of Deheubarth, and ruled Gwynedd until his death in 1023, when Iago ab Idwal recovered the rulership of Gwynedd for the senior line of the Aberffraw house. Iago reigned over Gwynedd until 1039, when he was murdered by his own men, perhaps under the direction of Gruffydd of Rhuddlan, Llywelyn ap Seisyll's eldest son. At age four, the Aberffraw heir Cynan ab Iago escaped with his mother to exile in Dublin. =Gruffydd ap Llywelyn; 1039–1063= Gruffydd ap Llywelyn seized control of Gwynedd in 1039 with the death of Iago ab Idwal and, after taking possession of Powys, struck at Mercia, slaying Edwin of Mercia, brother of Leofric, Earl of Mercia.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales: From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Takes Gwynedd and Powys, attacks Mercia, pg 3, Conquest of South Wales, Alliance with Ælfgar of Mercia pg 4–9, Gruffydd's decisive defeat of the Mercians in battle at Rhyd y Groes on the Severn (location unknown) neutralised Mercian incursions on Gwynedd and Powys' eastern borders as many of Mercia's leading magnates were also slain alongside Edwin of Mercia. Conquest of south Wales Gruffydd then turned his attention to the conquest of Deheubarth, ruled by his maternal cousin Hywel ab Edwin of the House of Dinefwr. The latter was \\"by no means easy to dislodge\\", wrote Lloyd. Gruffydd raided Deheubarth's province of Ceredigion in 1036, ravaging the lands of the monastic community of Llanbadarn Fawr (Great Llanbadarn). Hywel of Deheubarth was able to defend Deheubarth against Gruffydd's raids until he was defeated in 1041 at the Battle of Pencader, after which Gruffydd captured Hywel's wife and became master of Ceredigion. Following the Battle of Pencader, Hywel retained Dyfed (Pembrokeshire) and Ystrad Tywi (Carmarthenshire), the heart of Deheubarth. However he was expelled by Gruffydd in 1043 after an unrecorded event, and sought refuge in Ireland. In 1044 Hywel returned to recover Deheubarth with an army of Hiberno-Norse, but was slain and defeated in the Battle of Aber Tywi by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Between 1044 and 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn fought Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of Gwent for control of Deheubarth. Following the defeat of Hywel by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of Gwent was able to \\"stir up\\" the minor commote lords of Deheubarth on his behalf, and to call up an army to resist Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, wrote Lloyd. By 1046 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn allied with Sweyn Godwinson, Earl of Hereford, and the two of them campaigned in South Wales against Gruffydd of Gwent. In 1047 the lords of Ystrad Tywi, the heart of Deheubarth and the seat of the Dinefwr family, led an army which totally defeated the 150-strong teulu, or household guard, of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who was narrowly able to escape. In retaliation against the resurgent nobles of Ystrad Tywi and Dyfed, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn devastated those provinces, but \\"in vain\\", wrote John Edward Lloyd, \\"as his authority in South Wales was ... shattered\\" by Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of Gwent who was now firmly in control of Ystrad Tywi and Dyfed. In the summer of 1052 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn raided the Norman settlements in Herefordshire in retaliation for the displacement of his former ally Sweyn Godwinson. Sweyn Godwinson and his family were forced into exile and replaced by the Norman Ralph the Timid. Gruffydd defeated the mixed force of Norman and English sent against his raiding party near Leominster. In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn defeated and killed his southern rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch and took possession of Deheubarth, later driving out Meurig ap Hywel and Cadwagan ap Hywel of Gwent, and so becoming master over the whole of Wales. Wars with England Gruffydd allied with Ælfgar, Earl of East Anglia (and son of Leofric, Earl of Mercia) who had been dispossessed of his earldom on charges of treason, charges which may or may not have been substantiated.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Alliance with Ælfgar of East Anglia, Raid of Hereford, Defeat of Bishop Leofgar, King of Wales, Conquests pgs 8–11 On 24 October 1055, Gruffydd, Ælfgar, and Ælfgar's Hiberno-Norse mercenaries attacked the Norman settlement at Hereford, defeating Ralph, Earl of Hereford, and razing Hereford Castle. In the looting which followed, Gruffydd and Ælfgar raided Hereford Cathedral of its rich vessels and furnishings, killing seven of the canons who sought to bar the cathedral doors against the raiders. Edward the Confessor, King of England, commissioned Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, to respond to Gruffydd's raid on Hereford. However Harold was unable to penetrate into Wales but for a few miles beyond the Dyffryn Dŵr (Valley of Dore). A peace accord was reached between Gruffydd, Ælfgar, Harold of Wessex, and Edward the Confessor at Billingsley, near Boulston in Archenfield, with Ælfgar regaining his earldom of East Anglia. Despite the peace of Billingsley, cross border raids continued. In June 1056 Leofgar, Bishop of Hereford led an army into Wales in revenge for the earlier raid by Gruffydd and Ælfgar.Bishop Leofgar's raiding party also included Ælfoth, Sheriff of Hereford, and other priests of Hereford Cathedral. Gruffydd defeated Bishop Leofgar on 16 June in a battle in Dyffryn Machawy, with the bishop among those slain. The following year the men of Hereford raised another army against the Welsh, but their army was dogged by skirmishes and defeat, and they were obliged to negotiate for a peace. King of Wales Wales c. 1039–1063 Gruffydd and his \\"ever-victorious Welshmen\\", argued Lloyd, continued to pose a threat to the west of England. In 1056, a treaty was reached between Gruffydd, master of Wales and the Welsh marches, and the leading magnates of England, who included Earl Harold Godwinson, Earl Leofric of Mercia, and Aldred of Worcester (soon to be Archbishop of York). Gruffydd would be recognised in all of his conquests if he would swear fealty to King Edward the Confessor, becoming an \\"under-king\\" in a similar manner to the King of Scots. Agreeing to the terms, Gruffydd travelled from Chepstow to Gloucester where he and King Edward the Confessor met, and the treaty terms performed. From his family seat at Rhuddlan, Gruffydd ruled the whole of Wales as king. Gruffydd's position as King of Wales was further strengthened in 1057 when his friend and ally, Ælfgar, Earl of East Anglia, inherited Mercia on the death of his father, Earl Leofric. Their alliance was cemented by a dynastic marriage between Gruffydd and Ældyth, Ælfgar's daughter, around this time. As allied neighbors, Gruffydd and Ælfgar were \\"fortified against all attack\\", argued Lloyd, as their territory included Gruffydd's Wales, and Ælfgar's Mercia and Anglia. However, Earl Ælfgar died in 1062 and was succeeded by his young and inexperienced son Edwin. The loss of a strong Mercian ruler exposed Gruffydd's position. Following King Edward's Christmas court held at Gloucester, \\"at a time most unusual for campaigning in Wales\\", noted Lloyd, Harold Godwinson led a small force of huscarls from Chester into Wales, boldly striking Gruffydd's court at Rhuddlan. However Gruffydd received warning beforehand, and escaped on a small ship into the River Clwyd just as Harold's forces took Rhuddlan. Having failed to take Gruffydd in the winter of 1062, Harold Godwinson began preparations for a spring campaign in Wales. Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria and Harold's brother, brought a force into North Wales aiming to conquer Ynys Môn, while Harold assembled a light infantry at Bristol, where they boarded ships sailing for North Wales. On landing first in South Wales, and seeing the English army, the local magnates of Deheubarth came to terms with Harold and gave hostages as a guarantee of peace. Harold continued on to Gwynedd, where Gruffydd was already besieged by Tostig's army and \\"driven from one hiding place to another\\", wrote Lloyd. Harold landed in Wales and joined in the hunt, and offered peace to the Welsh of Gwynedd in exchange for Gruffydd's head. Desperate to end the Anglo-Saxon siege, Gruffydd's own men murdered him on 5 August 1063. Following Gruffydd's death, Harold took Gruffydd's widow Ældyth of Mercia as his wife. Ældyth was the only woman to have been known as Queen of Wales and then Queen of England in turn. =Mathrafal ascendency and the Harrowing of the North; 1063–1081= Wales c. 1063–1081 Harold Godwinson did not undertake the conquest or occupation of Wales; there was not the planning or resources nor any national will to conquer Wales. Harold aimed at the elimination of any centralized authority in Wales. On his death, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's maternal half brothers Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn of the Mathrafal (pronounced Mathraval) house of Powys divided Gwynedd and Powys between them, swearing fealty to Edward the Confessor who endorsed their seizure, and with Deheubarth, Glamorgan, and Gwent returned to their historic dynasties.The Mathrafal family were themselves were descended from the Dinefwr family through Angharad, daughter of the Prince of Deheubarth and mother to Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and Bleddyn ap Cynfyn.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, rules in Gwynedd, pg 12, allies with Mercia/Northumbria & aftermath, pg 14 death of, pg 16K. L. Maund is of the opinion that Bleddyn ruled Gwynedd and Rhiwallon Powys, Bleddyn ap Cynfyn allied with the Anglo- Saxons of Northern England to resist the threat from William the Conqueror following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. In 1067 Bleddyn and Rhiwallon joined with the Mercian Eadric the Wild in an attack on the Normans at Hereford Castle, and ravaged the Norman lands in Herefordshire along the River Lugg, \\"causing serious damage\\" to the Normans, wrote Lloyd. Between 1068 and 1070 Bleddyn allied with Edwin, Earl of Mercia, Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria and Morcar of Northumbria in an alliance against the Normans during the Harrowing of the North. However the defeat of the Saxons in 1070 exposed lower Gwynedd, the Perfeddwlad, to Norman incursions, with Robert \\"of Rhuddlan\\" taking Rhuddlan Castle and establishing himself firmly at the mouth of the Clwyd river by 1073. Bleddyn was killed in 1075 by Rhys ab Owain, Prince of Deheubarth, an ally of the dispossessed Aberffraw heir of Gwynedd, Gruffudd ap Cynan, who was himself attempting to recover his inheritance. Rhys ab Owain was able to recover Deheubarth for the House of Dinefwr following the death of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1063. However, Trahaearn ap Caradog of Arwystli, Bleddyn's cousin, took control of Gwynedd and by 1078 defeated Rhys ab Owain at the Battle of Goodwick.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, rules in Gwynedd, pg 17, allies with Mercia/Northumbria & aftermath, pg 14 routed by Gruffydd, pg 19; regains Gwynedd, 20; Battle of Goodwick, pg 27; death of, pg 22 Trahaearn allied with Caradog ap Gruffydd of Gwent against Deheubarth. Gruffudd ap Cynan, who grew up in exile in Dublin and was himself half Hiberno-Norse on his mother's side, made his first attempt to recover Gwynedd in 1075 when he landed on Ynys Môn with a Norse force, and mercenary troops provided by Robert of Rhuddlan. Gruffudd ap Cynan first defeated and killed Cynwrig ap Rhiwallon, an ally of Trahaearn who held Llŷn, then defeated Trahaearn himself in the Battle of Gwaed Erw in Meirionnydd, gaining control of Gwynedd. Gruffudd then led his forces eastwards into lower Gwynedd, the Perfeddwlad, to recover lands lost to the Normans. Despite the \\"assistance\\" previously given by Robert of Rhuddlan, Gruffudd attacked and destroyed Rhuddlan castle. However, tension between Gruffudd's Hiberno-Norse bodyguard and the local Welsh led to a rebellion in Llŷn, and Trahaearn took the opportunity to counterattack, defeating Gruffudd at the Battle of Bron yr Erw, above Clynnog Fawr, that same year. Gruffudd retreated to Ireland but in 1081 returned and made an alliance with Rhys ap Tewdwr, the new Prince of Deheubarth following the death of his cousin. Rhys had been attacked by Caradog ap Gruffydd of Gwent and Morgannwg, and had been forced to flee from his fortress of Dinefwr to St David's Cathedral in Penfro (Pembrokeshire). Leading Aberffraw partisans from Gwynedd and Norse-Gaelic mercenaries from Waterford, Ireland, Gruffudd joined his ally Rhys ap Tewdwr of Deheubarth, and the two marched their army north to seek out Trahaearn ap Caradog and Caradog ap Gruffydd of Powys, who had themselves made an alliance and been joined by Meilyr ap Rhiwallon of Morgannwg-Gwent. The armies of the two confederacies met at the Battle of Mynydd Carn, with Gruffudd and Rhys victorious and Trahaearn, Caradog and Meilyr all killed.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Gruffudd ap Cynan; Battle of Mynydd Carn, Norman Invasion, pg 104–108, reconstructing Gwynedd pg 116, Gruffudd recovered Gwynedd for the second time. =Norman invasion, and the Aberffraw resistance; 1081–1100= Gruffydd ap Cynan escapes from Chester, Illustration by T. Prytherch in 1900 However, Gruffudd's victory was short- lived as the Normans launched an invasion of Wales following the Saxon revolt in northern England. Shortly after the Battle of Mynydd Carn in 1081, Gruffudd was lured into a trap with the promise of an alliance but seized by Hugh the Fat, 1st Earl of Chester in an ambush at Rug, near Corwen.Warner, Philip, Famous Welsh Battles, Gruffydd's seizure pg 61, Escape from Chester, Kills Robert of Rhuddlan, pg 63, 1997, Barnes & Noble, INC. Earl Hugh claimed the Perfeddwlad up to the Clwyd river (the commotes of Tegeingl and Rhufoniog; the modern counties of Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham) as part of Chester, and viewed the restoration of the Aberffraw family in Gwynedd as a threat to his own expansion into Wales. The lands west of the Clwyd were intended for his cousin Robert of Rhuddlan, and their advance extended to the Llŷn peninsula by 1090. Once in power, the Normans sought control over the spiritual traditions and ecclesiastical institutions in Wales.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Celtic Church, 72–79 Welsh Church pg 118Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Subjection of the Welsh Church, pgs 64–74 In his effort further to consolidate control over Gwynedd, Earl Hugh of Chester had forced the election of Hervé the Breton upon the Bangor diocese in 1092, with Hervé's consecration as Bishop of Bangor performed by Thomas of Bayeux, the Archbishop of York.Barlow, Frank,William Rufus, Yale University Press, 200, p. 320–324 It was hoped that placing a prelate loyal to the Normans over the traditionally independent Welsh Church in Gwynedd would help pacify the local inhabitants. However, the Welsh parishioners remained hostile to Hervé's appointment, and the bishop was forced to carry a sword with him and rely on a contingent of Norman knights for his protection.Bartlett, Robert C. (2000). England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075–1225. Oxford: Clarendon Press. .Owen \\"Hervery (d. 1131)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition accessed 6 March 2008 Additionally, Hervé routinely excommunicated parishioners who he perceived as challenging his spiritual and temporal authority. Beach at Deganwy. Prince Gruffudd slew Robert \\"of Rhuddlan\\" near here in battle around 3 July 1093. By 1093 almost the whole of Wales was occupied by Norman forces and they erected many castles in an effort to consolidate their gains. However, their control in most regions of Wales proved tenuous at best. Motivated by local anger over the \\"gratuitously cruel\\" occupation, and led by the historic ruling houses such as Gwynedd's Aberffraw family, represented by Gruffudd ap Cynan, Welsh control over the greater part of Wales was restored by 1100. Gruffudd escaped Norman imprisonment in Chester, and slew Robert of Rhuddlan in a beach side battle at Deganwy on 3 July 1093. The flag of revolt was raised across Wales in 1094, and William II of England was compelled to respond by leading two ultimately ineffective campaigns against Gruffudd in lower Gwynedd in 1095 and 1097. By 1098 Gruffudd allied with Cadwgan ap Bleddyn of the Mathrafal house of Powys, their traditional dynastic rivalries notwithstanding, with the two coordinating their resistance campaigns. Earl Hugh of Chester and Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury had greater success in their 1098 campaign against the Welsh, bringing their army to the Menai Strait. Gruffudd and Cadwgan regrouped on defensible Ynys Môn, where they planned to make retaliatory strikes from their island fortress. Gruffudd hired a Norse fleet from a settlement in Ireland to patrol the Menai and prevent the Norman army from crossing; however the Normans were able to pay off the fleet to ferry them to Môn instead. Betrayed, Gruffudd and Cadwgan were forced to flee to Ireland in a skiff. Ynys Seiriol (Puffin island), seen here from Penmon Point. The Normans landed on Môn, and their furious 'victory celebrations' which followed were exceptionally violent with rape and carnage committed by Norman soldiers left unchecked. The Earl of Shrewsbury had an elderly priest mutilated, and made the church of Llandyfrydog a kennel for his dogs. During the 'celebrations', a Norse fleet led by Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, appeared off the coast at Ynys Seiriol (Puffin Island), and in the battle that followed, known as the Battle of Anglesey Sound, Magnus shot dead the Earl of Shrewsbury with an arrow to the eye. The Norse left as suddenly and as mysteriously as they had arrived, however leaving the Norman army weakened and demoralized. The Norman army retired to England, leaving a Welshman, Owain ap Edwin, lord of Tegeingl, in command of a token force to control Ynys Môn and upper Gwynedd, and ultimately abandoning any colonization plans there.Wilcott, Darrell \\"The Ancestry of Edwin of Tegeingl\\" Owain ap Edwin transferred his allegiance to Chester following the defeat of his ally Trahaearn ap Caradog in 1081, a move which earned him the epithet Bradwr, traitor, among the Welsh. Nevertheless, Gruffudd did marry Owain ab Edwin's daughter Anghared. 12th century =Pura Wallia and Marchia Wallie= In late 1098 Gruffudd and Cadwgan landed in Wales and recovered Ynys Môn without much difficulty, with Hervé the Breton fleeing Bangor for safety in England. Over the course of the next three years Gruffudd recovered upper Gwynedd to the Conwy and defeating Hugh, Earl of Chester in border skirmishes. In 1101, after Earl Hugh's death, Gruffudd and Cadwgan came to terms with England's new king, Henry I, who was consolidating his own authority and also eager to come to terms. In the negotiations which followed Henry I recognized Gruffudd's ancestral claims of Môn, Arfon, Llŷn, Dunoding (Eifionydd and Ardudwy) and Arllechwedd (Môn, Caernarfonshire and northern Merionethshire), the lands of upper Gwynedd to the Conwy which were already firmly in Gruffudd's control. Cadwgan regained Ceredigion, and his share of the family inheritance in Powys, from the new earl of Shrewsbury, Robert of Bellême. With the settlement reached between Henry I and Gruffudd ap Cynan, and other Welsh lords, the division of Wales between Pura Wallia, the two-thirds of Wales under Welsh control; and Marchia Wallie, the remaining one-third of Wales under Norman control, came into existence.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Pura Wallia, Purae Wallie (the Welshries), Marchia Wallie pg 109, 127–130, 137, 141, 149, 166, 176 Author and historian John Davies notes that the border shifted on occasion, \\"in one direction and in the other\\", but remained more or less stable for almost the next two hundred years. =Reconstruction of Gwynedd, 1101–1132= After generations of incessant warfare, Gruffudd began the reconstruction of Gwynedd, intent on bringing stability to his country. According to Davies, Gruffudd sought to give his people the peace to \\"plant their crops in the full confidence that they would be able to harvest them\\". Gruffudd consolidated princely authority in north Wales, and offered sanctuary to displaced Welsh from the Perfeddwlad, particularly from Rhos, at the time harassed by Richard, 2nd Earl of Chester.J.E. Lloyd, A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004,\\"Advances westward\\" pg 77, 78, 79 Alarmed by Gruffudd's growing influence and authority in north Wales, and on the pretext that Gruffudd sheltered rebels from Rhos against Chester, Henry I launched a campaign against Gwynedd and Powys in 1114, which included a vanguard commanded by King Alexander I of Scotland. While Owain ap Cadwgan of Ceredigion sought refuge in Gwynedd's mountains, Maredudd ap Bleddyn of Powys made peace with the English king as the Norman army advanced. There were no battles or skirmishes fought in the face of the vast host brought into Wales, rather Owain and Gruffudd entered into truce negotiations. Owain ap Cadwgan regained royal favor relatively easily. However Gruffudd was forced to render homage and fealty and pay a heavy fine, though he lost no land or prestige. The invasion left a lasting impact on Gruffudd, who by 1114 was in his 60s and had failing eyesight. For the remainder of his life, while Gruffudd continued to rule in Gwynedd, his sons Cadwallon, Owain, and Cadwaladr, would lead Gwynedd's army after 1120. Gruffudd's policy, which his sons would execute and later rulers of Gwynedd adopted, was to recover Gwynedd's primacy without blatantly antagonizing the English crown. In 1120 a minor border war between Lywarch ab Owain, lord of a commote in the Dyffryn Clwyd cantref, and Hywel ab Ithel, lord of Rhufoniog and Rhos (all three part of either Conwy county or Denbighshire) brought Powys and Chester into conflict in the Perfeddwlad. Powys brought a force of 400 warriors to the aid of its ally Rhufoniog, while Chester sent Norman knights from Rhuddlan to the aid of Dyffryn Clwyd. The bloody Battle of Maes Maen Cymro, fought a mile to the north-west of Ruthin, ended with Lywarch ab Owain slain and the defeat of Dyffryn Clwyd. However, it was a pyrrhic victory as the battle left Hywel ab Ithel mortally wounded. The last of his line, when Hywel ab Ithel died six weeks later he left Rhufoniog and Rhos bereft. Powys, however, was not strong enough to garrison Rhufoniog and Rhos, nor was Chester able to exert influence inland from its coastal holdings of Rhuddlan and Deganwy. With Rhufoniog and Rhos abandoned, Gruffudd annexed the cantrefi back into Gwynedd, separated from Gwynedd since the initial Norman invasions. On the death of Einion ap Cadwgan, lord of Meirionydd, a quarrel engulfed his kinsmen on who should succeed him. Meirionydd was then a vassal cantref of Powys, and the family there a cadet of the Mathrafal house of Powys. Gruffudd gave licence to his sons Cadwallon and Owain to press the opportunity the dynastic strife in Meirionydd presented. The brothers raided Meirionydd with the Lord of Powys as important there as he was in the Perfeddwlad. However it would not be until 1136 that the cantref was firmly within Gwynedd's control. Perhaps because of their support of Earl Hugh of Chester, Gwynedd's rival, in 1124 Cadwallon slew the three rulers of Dyffryn Clwyd, his maternal uncles, bringing the cantref firmly under Gwynedd's vassalage that year. And in 1125 Cadwallon slew the grandsons of Edwin ap Goronwy of Tegeingl, leaving Tegeingl bereft of lordship and annexed back into Gwynedd. However, in 1132 while on campaign in the commote of Nanheudwy, near Llangollen, 'victorious' Cadwallon was defeated in battle and slain by an army from Powys. The defeat checked Gwynedd's expansion for a time, \\"much to the relief of the men of Powys\\", wrote historian Sir John Edward Lloyd (J.E Lloyd). = During England's Anarchy 1135–1157 =  The Great Revolt; 1136–1137  Tremadog Bay, near Harlech. The region was part of the commote of Ardudwy in the Dunoding cantref, now in the Merionethshire district. By 1136 an opportunity arose for the Welsh to recover lands lost to the Marcher lords after Stephen de Blois had displaced his cousin Empress Matilda from succeeding her father to the English throne the previous year, sparking the Anarchy in England.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Great Revolt, beginnings Gwenllian pg 80, taking Ceredigion, restores Welsh monks, Battle of Crug Mawr, 82–85Davies, John, A History of Wales, the Anarchy, Norman vulnerability in Wales, extends borders, Oswestry annexed, capture of Rhuddlan, Ystrad Alun, Ial, Tegeingl, 124 The usurpation and conflict it caused eroded central authority in England. The revolt began in south Wales, as Hywel ap Maredudd, lord of Brycheiniog (Brecknockshire), gathered his men and marched to the Gower, defeating the Norman and English colonists there. Inspired by Hywel of Brycheiniog's success, Gruffydd ap Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, hastened to meet with Gruffudd ap Cynan of Gwynedd, his father-in-law, to enlist his aid in the revolt. However, with Gruffydd ap Rhys' absence the Normans increased their incursions into Deheubarth, and Gwenllian, Princess of Deheubarth, gathered a host for the defense of her country.Warner, Philip Famous Welsh Battles, Gwenllian pg 69, 79 Gwenllian was the youngest daughter of Gruffydd ap Cynan of Gwynedd, and after she eloped with the Prince of Deheubarth she joined him resisting Norman occupation in south Wales. Husband and wife led retaliatory strikes on Norman positions in Deheubarth, taking goods from the Norman, English, and Flemish colonists and redistributing them to Deheubarth's displaced Welsh, \\"as a pair of Robin Hoods of Wales\\", wrote historian Philip Warner. With her husband meeting with her father in Gwynedd, Gwenllian raised an army to counter Norman incursions ravaging Deheubarth. Gwenllian met the Norman army, led by Maurice of London, near Kidwelly Castle, but her forces were routed. Captured, the princess was beheaded by the Normans, the field where she lost her head later remembered as Maes Gwenllian, the 'Field of Gwenllian'. Though defeated, Gwenllian's 'patriotic revolt' inspired others in south Wales to rise. The Welsh of Gwent, led by Iorwerth ab Owain (grandson of Caradog ap Gruffydd, Gwent's Welsh ruler displaced by the Norman invasions), ambushed and slew Richard de Clare, the grandson of the Norman lord Richard Fitz Gilbert. When word reached Gwynedd of Gwenllian's death and the revolt in Gwent, Gruffydd ap Cynan's sons Owain and Cadwaladr invaded Norman controlled Ceredigion, taking Llanfihangel, Aberystwyth, and Llanbadarn Fawr. Liberating Llanbadarn, one local chronicler hailed Owain and Cadwaladr both as \\"bold lions, virtuous, fearless and wise, who guard the churches and their indwellers, defenders of the poor [who] overcome their enemies, affording a safest retreat to all those who seek their protection\\". The brothers restored the Welsh monks of Llanbadarn, who had been displaced by monks from Gloucester brought there by the Normans who had controlled Ceredigion. By late September 1136 a vast Welsh host gathered in Ceredigion, which included the combined forces of Gwynedd, Deheubarth, and Powys; and met the Norman army at the Battle of Crug Mawr at Cardigan Castle. The battle turned into a rout, and then into a resounding defeat of the Normans. Realizing how vulnerable they were to a resurgent Wales during the Great Revolt, the Marcher lords became estranged from Stephen de Blois due in large part to his lackluster response to the Welsh resurgence. These lords began shifting their allegiance back to the cause of Empress Matilda and the return of a strong royal government. =Gruffudd's death and legacy, 1137= Bangor Cathedral from Bangor Mountain, where Prince Gruffudd ap Cynan was interred. Gruffudd ap Cynan, now elderly and blind, died in 1137.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Gruffyd's legacy pg 79, 80 With Gruffudd at his deathbed were his family, but also leading church figures, including the diocese bishop and trusted advisor David the Scot, the archdeacon of the diocese Simon of Clynnog, and the Prior of St Werburgh's in Chestor. Gruffudd bequeathed money to many notable churches throughout Gwynedd and in other lands, including the Danish foundation of Christ Church, Dublin, where he had worshipped as a boy growing up with his mother's people. To his wife Princess Angharad,Angharad was the daughter of Owain ab Edwin of Tegeingle, and their marriage may have been in an effort to solidify Gwynedd's eastern border with Chester, a circumstance which did not prevent Cadwalader and Owain from slaying their mother's kinsmen when they revolted against Gwynedd's rule. who survived Gruffudd by twenty-five years, he left an estate and the profits from the port and ferry of Aber Menai, \\"the scene of many of his youthful adventures\\". Prince Gruffudd was interred in a tomb erected in the presbytery of Bangor Cathedral, to the left of the high altar. \\"So rested at last a man whose life had been troubled and stormy in no common degree\\", wrote Lloyd. Meilyr Brydydd, Gruffudd's Pencerdd of Gwynedd, wrote: > The king of England came with his battalions- > Though he came, he returned not with cattle. > Gruffydd hid himself not, but with open force > Hotly did champion and protect his people. Gruffudd died knowing that he left to his son Owain a more stable realm than had hitherto existed in Gwynedd for many generations, according to Lloyd. No foreign army was able to cross the Conwy, nor raiders from across the hills, that might disturb Gwynedd's peace. The stability provided by Prince Gruffudd allowed for a generation of Gwyneddwyr to settle and plan for the future without fear that their homes and harvests would \\"go to the flames\\" from invaders, according to Lloyd. The Gwyneddwyr \\"planted orchards and laid out gardens, set up fences and dug out ditches; they ventured to build in stone and, in particular, raised stone churches in place of the old timer oratories\\", wrote Lloyd paraphrasing the Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan.The lack of stone structures, and stone churches in particular, was one of the defining reasons the Norman's gave for subjecting the Welsh, according to historian John Davies. So many limewashed stone churches, the Eglwys Wen or White Churches, were built across Gwynedd that the principality \\"[became] bespangled with them as is the firmament with stars\\". Gruffudd had stone churches built at his princely manors, and Lloyd suggests Gruffudd's example led to the rebuilding of churches with stone in Penmon, Aberdaron, and Towyn, all in the Norman fashion. Additionally, Gruffudd funded the construction of Bangor Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Deiniol, under the episcopate of Gruffudd's advisor Bishop David the Scot. Gruffudd acquiesced to many of the Latin reforms brought to Wales in the wake of the Norman invaders, reforms such as a more structured episcopate within Gwynedd. =Owain ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd= When their father Gruffudd ap Cynan died in 1137, the brothers Owain and Cadwaladr were on a second campaign in Ceredigion, and took the castles of Ystrad Meurig, Lampeter (Stephen's Castle), and Castell Hywel (usually known as Humphrey's Castle) Owain ap Gruffydd succeeded his father to the greater portion of Gwynedd in accordance to conventional Welsh law and custom, the Cyfraith Hywel, the Laws of Hywel.Lewis, Hurbert; The Ancient Laws of Wales, 1889. Chapter VIII: Royal Succession; Rules to Marriage; Alienation pgs 192–200. According to Hurbert Lewis, that though not explicitly codified as such, the edling, or Heir apparent, was by convention, custom, and practice the eldest son of the lord and entitled to inherit the position and title as \\"head of the family\\" from the father. Effectively primogeniture with local variations. However, all sons were provided for out of the lands of the father and in certain circumstances so too were daughters. Additionally, sons could claim maternal patrimony through their mother in certain circumstances. Later historians refer to Owain ap Gruffydd as Owain Gwynedd to differentiate him from another Owain ap Gruffydd, the Mathrafal ruler of Powys, known as Owain Cyfeiliog.Lloyd, J.E. 0A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Gruffydd Gwynedd, Gruffydd Cyfeiliog, pg 93 Cadwaladr, Gruffudd's youngest son, inherited the commote of Aberffraw on Ynys Môn, and the recently conquered Meirionydd and Northern Ceredigion, that is Ceredigion between the rivers Aeron and Dyfi.Lloyd, J.E. 0A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Cadwaladr's inheritance, pgs 85, 93, 104Upper Ceredigion was the commotes of Penweddig and Uwch Aeron (Upper or above the Aeron river) By 1141 Cadwaladr and Madog ap Maredudd of Powys led a Welsh vanguard as an ally of the Earl of Chester as partisans for Empress Matilda in the Battle of Lincoln, and joined in the rout which made Stephen of England prisoner of the empress for a year.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd's inheritance, pg 94, 95 Owain, however, did not participate in the battle, keeping the Gwyneddwyr army home. Owain, of restrained and prudent temperament, may have judged that aiding Stephen de Blois' capture would lead to the restoration of Empress Matilda and a strong royal government in England; a government which would support Marcher lords, support absent since Stephen's usurpation. Owain and Cadwaladr came to blows in 1143 when Cadwaladr was implicated in the murder of Prince Anarawd ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, Owain's ally and intended son-in-law, on the eve of Anarawd's wedding to Owain's daughter.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Cadwaladr's betrayal, pg 95Warner, Philip \\"Famous Welsh Battles\\", Cadwaladr and Anarawd pg 80 Owain followed a diplomatic policy of binding other Welsh rulers to Gwynedd through dynastic marriages, and Cadwaladr's border dispute and murder of Anarawd threatened Owain's efforts and credibility. As ruler of Gwynedd, Owain stripped Cadwaladr of his lands, with Owain's son Hywel dispatched to Ceredigion, where he burned Cadwaladr's castle at Aberystwyth. Cadwaladr fled to Ireland and hired a Norse fleet from Dublin, bringing the fleet to Abermenai to compel Owain to reinstate him. Taking advantage of the brotherly strife, and perhaps with the tacit understanding of Cadwaladr, the marcher lords mounted incursions into Wales. Realizing the wider ramifications of the war before him, Owain and Cadwaladr came to terms and reconciled, with Cadwaladr restored to his lands. Peace between the brothers held until 1147, when an unrecorded event occurred which led Owain's sons Hywel and Cynan to drive Cadwaladr out of Meirionydd and Ceredigion, with Cadwaladr retreating to Môn. Again an accord was reached, with Cadwaladr retaining Aberffraw until a more serious breach occurred in 1153, when he was forced into exile in England, where his wife was the sister of Gilbert de Clare, 2nd Earl of Hertford and the niece of Ranulph de Gernon, 2nd Earl of Chester. In 1146 news reached Owain that his favoured eldest son and heir, Rhun, had died. Owain was overcome with grief, falling into a deep melancholy from which none could console him, until news reached him that Mold castle in Tegeingl (Flintshire) had fallen to Gwynedd, \\"[reminding Owain] that he had still a country for which to live\\", wrote historian Sir John Edward Lloyd.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Rhun's death, pg 96 Between 1148 and 1151, Owain I of Gwynedd fought against Madog ap Maredudd of Powys, Owain's brother-in-law, and against the Earl of Chester for control of Iâl (Yale, near Wrexham), with Owain having secured Rhuddlan Castle and all of Tegeingl from Chester.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Owain takes Iâl, Ruddlan, Tegeingl, pg 96, 97, 98 \\"By 1154 Owain had brought his men within sight of the red towers of the great city on the Dee\\", wrote Lloyd. =Henry II's 1157 campaign= Having spent three years consolidating his authority in the vast Angevin Empire, Henry II of England resolved on a strategy against Owain I of Gwynedd by 1157. By now, Owain's enemies had joined Henry II's camp, enemies such as his wayward brother Cadwaladr and in particular Madog of Powys.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Owain and Henry II, pg 99. 1070 Henry II raised his feudal host and marched into Wales from Chester. Owain positioned himself and his army at Dinas Basing (Basingwerk), barring the road to Rhuddlan, setting up a trap in which Henry II would send his army along the direct road along the coast, while he crossed through the woods to outflank Owain. The Prince of Gwynedd anticipated this, and dispatched his sons Dafydd and Cynan into the woods with an army, catching Henry II unaware. In the melée which followed, known as the Battle of Ewloe, Henry II would have been slain had not Roger, Earl of Hertford rescued him. Henry II retreated and made his way back to his main army, by now slowly advancing towards Rhuddlan. Not wishing to engage the Norman army directly, Owain repositioned himself first at St. Asaph, then further west, clearing the road for Henry II to enter Rhuddlan \\"ingloriously\\". Once in Rhuddlan, Henry II received word that his naval expedition had failed. Instead of meeting Henry II at Deganwy or Rhuddlan as the king had commanded, the English fleet had gone to plunder Môn. The naval expedition was led by Henry II's maternal uncle (Empress Matilda's half-brother), Henry FitzRoy; and when they landed on Môn, Henry FitzRoy had the churches of Llanbedr Goch and Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf torched. During the night the men of Môn gathered together, and the next morning fought and defeated the Norman army, with Henry FitzRoy falling under a shower of lances. The defeat of his navy and his own military difficulties had convinced Henry II that he had \\"gone as far as was practical that year\\" in his effort to subject Owain, and the king offered terms to the prince. Owain I of Gwynedd, \\"ever prudent and sagacious\\", wrote Lloyd, recognized that he needed time to consolidate power further, and agreed to the terms. Owain was to render homage and fealty to the King, and resign Tegeingl and Rhuddlan to Chester, and restore Cadwaladr to his possessions in Gwynedd. The death of Madog ap Meredudd of Powys in 1160 opened an opportunity for Owain I of Gwynedd to press Gwynedd's influence further at the expense of Powys.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Owain 1160–1170, pg 107, 108, 109, However, Owain continued to further Gwynedd's expansion without rousing the English crown and maintaining his 'prudent policy' of Quieta non movere (don't move settled things), according to Lloyd. It was a policy of outward conciliation, while masking his own consolidation of authority. To further demonstrate his goodwill, in 1160 Owain handed over to the English crown the fugitive Einion Clud. By 1162 Owain was in possession of the Powys cantref of Cyfeiliog, and its castle of Tafolwern; and ravaged another Powys cantref of Arwystli, slaying its lord, Hywel ab Ieuaf, with both actions causing little apparent reaction from the Norman occupiers. Owain's strategy was in sharp contrast to Rhys ap Gruffydd, prince of Deheubarth, who in 1162 rose in open revolt against the Normans in south Wales, drawing Henry II back to England from the continent. With Owain's growing influence throughout Wales as the premier Welsh ruler, Owain adopted the Latin title Princeps Wallensium, Prince of the Welsh, echoing historic Aberffraw claims as the primary royal family of Wales as senior line descendants of Rhodri the Great. The title was later given substance following the outcome of Great Revolt of 1166, wrote Professor John Davies.Davies, John A History of Wales, the title Princeps Wallensium =Great Revolt of 1166= In 1163 Henry II quarrelled with Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, causing growing divisions between the king's supporters and the archbishop's supporters. With discontent mounting in England, Owain I of Gwynedd joined with Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth in a second grand Welsh revolt against Henry II.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Henry and Becket, Owain's leadership in 1166, Owain recaptures Tegeingl, pg125 Gwynedd's embassy to France pg 125,126 England's king, who only the previous year had pardoned Rhys ap Gruffydd for his 1162 revolt, assembled a vast host against the allied Welsh, with troops drawn from all over the Angevin empire assembling in Shrewsbury, and with the Norse of Dublin paid to harass the Welsh coast. While his army gathered on the Welsh frontier, Henry II left for the continent to negotiate a truce with France and Flanders in order for them to not disturb his peace while campaigning in Wales.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Henry's invasion plans pg 111, Welsh drawn together, pg 112, Angevin advance into Wales 112, 113, Henry II's campaign failure, pg 113, 114 However, when Henry II returned to England he found that the war had already begun, with Owain's son Dafydd raiding Angevin positions in Tegeingl, exposing the castles of Rhuddlan and Basingwerk to \\"serious dangers\\", wrote Lloyd. Henry II rushed to north Wales for a few days to shore up defences there, before returning to his main army now gathering in Croesoswallt (Oswestry). The vast host gathered before the allied Welsh principalities represented the largest army yet assembled for their conquest, a circumstance which further drew the Welsh allies into a closer confederacy, wrote Lloyd. With Owain I of Gwynedd the overall battle commander, and with his brother Cadwaladr as his second, Owain assembled the Welsh host at Corwen in the vale of Edeyrion where he could best resist Henry II's advance. The Angevin army advanced from Oswestry into Wales crossing the mountains towards Mur Castell and found itself in the thick forest of the Ceiriog Valley where it was forced into a narrow thin line. In the Battle of Crogen which followed; Owain I positioned a band of skirmishers in the thick woods overlooking the pass, where they harassed the exposed Angevin army from secured positions. Henry II ordered the clearing of the woods on either side to widen the passage through the valley and to lessen the exposure of his army. The road his army travelled later became known as the Ffordd y Saeson, the Englishmen's Road; it led through heath and bog towards the Dee. In a dry summer the mountain moors may have been passable, however \\"on this occasion the skies put on their most wintry aspect; and the rain fell in torrents [...] flooding the mountain meadows\\" until the great Angevin encampment became a \\"morass\\", wrote Lloyd. Having suffered many setbacks, and in the face of \\"hurricane\\" force wind and rain, diminishing provisions and an exposed supply line stretching through hostile country subject to enemy raids, and with a demoralized army, Henry II was forced into a complete retreat without even a semblance of a victory. In frustration, Henry II had twenty-two Welsh hostages mutilated; the sons of Owain' supporters and allies, including two of Owain's own sons. In addition to his failed campaign in Wales, Henry's mercenary Norse navy, which he had hired to harass the Welsh coast, turned out to be too small to be useful, and was disbanded without engagement. Henry II's Welsh campaign was a complete failure, with the king abandoning all plans for the conquest of Wales, returning to his court in Anjou and not returning to England for another four years. Lloyd wrote; > It is true that [Henry II] did not cross swords with [Owain I], but the > elements had done their work for [the Welsh]; the stars in their courses had > fought against the pride of England and humbled it to the very dust. To > conquer a land which was defended, not merely by the arms of its valiant and > audacious sons, but also by tangled woods and impassable bogs, by piercing > winds and pitiless storms of rain, seemed a hopeless task, and Henry > resolved to no longer attempt it. Owain expanded his international diplomatic offensive against Henry II by sending an embassy to Louis VII of France in 1168, led by Arthur of Bardsey, Bishop of Bangor (1166–1177), who was charged with negotiating a joint alliance against Henry II. With Henry II distracted by his widening quarrel with Thomas Becket, Owain's army recovered Tegeingl for Gwynedd by 1169. The following year, Prince Owain ap Gruffydd died and was interred in Bangor Cathedrial, near his father Gruffudd ap Cynan. =The Poet-Prince and the Gwynedd interregnum; 1170–1200= \\"Prince and Poet\\" (Tywysog a Bardd), The Prince Hywel ab Owain memorial, Pentraeth, Anglesey As the eldest surviving son and elding, Hywel succeeded his father in 1170 as Prince of Gwynedd in accordance with Welsh law and custom.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest Hywel's succession and overthrow by Cristen and Dafydd, pg 134 Dafydd takes Gwynedd by 1074, pg 135, Gwynedd between 1175–1188, pg 145Davies, John, A History of Wales, Davies argues that following the death of Hywel ab Owain, Iorwerth, as the eldest son, was the legitimate heir of Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd (page 126), as the next senior surviving son of Owain Gwynedd. After Iorwerth's death, his eldest son Llywelyn ab Iorwerth was the legitimate heir to the Crown and Throne of Gwynedd. With the rule of Gwynedd returning to the senior legitimate line of Aberffraw when Llywelyn defeated Dafydd ab Owain in 1194 (page 135) However, the new prince was immediately confronted by a coup d'état instigated by his step-mother Cristin, Princess Dowager of Gwynedd, possibly leading an anti- Irish faction at court.Cristin was the daughter of Goronwy ab Owain, and was Owain ap Gruffydd's first cousin. The Archbishop of Canterbury excommunicated Owain ap Gruffydd for not putting her away, as well as for disputing the appointed bishop of Bangor. The dowager princess plotted to have her eldest son by Owain, Dafydd, usurp the Crown and Throne of Gwynedd from Hywel; and with Gwynedd divided between Dafydd and her other sons Rhodri and Cynan. The speed with which Cristin and her sons acted suggest that the conspiracy may have had roots before Owain's death. Additionally, the complete surprise of the elder sons of Owain suggests that the scheme had been a well kept secret. Within months of his succession Hywel was forced to flee to Ireland, returning later that year with a Hiberno-Norse army and landing on Môn, where he may have had his younger half brother Maelgwn's support.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Earliest Times to the Edwardian ConquestDavies, R.R. The Age of Conquest; Wales 1066–1415 Dafydd himself landed his army on the island and caught Hywel off guard at Pentraeth, defeating his army and killing Hywel. Following Hywel's death and the defeat of the legitimist army, the surviving sons of Owain came to terms with Dafydd. Iorwerth- who was next in line of succession after his slain brother Hywel- was apportioned the commotes of Arfon and Arllechwedd, with his seat at Dolwyddelan, with Maelgwn retaining Ynys Môn, and with Cynan receiving Meirionydd.Maelgwn ab Owain secured himself on Ynys Môn following his father's death, and was strong enough to retain the island following Hywel's defeat by Dafydd. Maelgwen may have also been instrumental in supporting his full brother Iorwerth in keeping Arfon and Aellechwedd, for once Maelgwn was captured Iorwerth escaped into exile in Powys, at his wife's kinsmen's court.Lloyd suggests that despite some traditions, Iorwerth was in control of Arfon and Nant Conwy at least in 1170, given that he was buried at Penmachno. He may later have been expelled after the partition, as had Cynan, only to be buried at Penmachno.Arllechwedd commote is the west bank of the Conwy river in the modern Conwy local authority area However, by 1174 Iorwerth and Cynan were both dead and Maelgwn and Rhodri were imprisoned by Dafydd, who was now master over the whole of Gwynedd.Llywelyn ab Iorwerth was too young to press for his claim, though under Welsh law would have been prince of Gwynedd on the death of his father Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd During the upheavals of 1173–74 Dafydd had remained loyal to Henry II, and as if in reward for his loyalty, but also in recognition of Dafydd's apparent supremacy in north Wales, Dafydd married the king's half-sister Emma of Anjou.The Embassy Dafydd sent to Henry II was headed by Simon the Monk, who negotiated with the English crown for the marriage of Dafydd with Emma. Henry II did not approve of the match, but needed a Welsh ally to distract from the resurgent Welsh of South Wales under The Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth and rebellious marcher lords. However, Dafydd's ascendency was short-lived as Rhodri had escaped his imprisonment and took Arfon, Llŷn, Ynys Môn, and Arllechwedd, with Meirionydd, Ardydwy, and Eifionydd returned to Gruffydd and Meredudd ap Cynan.Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth had been recognized as lord of Meirionydd by Henry II in 1177, a claim he later abandoned after unsuccessful campaigning in 1177. Rhys ap Gruffydd then undertook an alliance with Rhodri ab Owain, who controlled Arfon, Llŷn, Ynys Môn, and Arllechwedd Though Henry II continued to recognize his brother-in-law Dafydd as Prince of Gwynedd he did not send aid to him, and Dafydd effectively had to content himself with the rule of lower Gwynedd, the Perfeddwlad, establishing court at Rhuddlan Castle. The following year Dafydd joined with other Welsh rulers in swearing fealty to Henry II at Oxford.

By 1187, on reaching his majority in Welsh law at age 14, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth began asserting his senior claim as Prince of Gwynedd over those of his paternal uncles Dafydd and Rhodri, harassing their positions with the aid of Gruffydd Maelor, lord of Powys Fadog and Llywelyn's maternal uncle; as attested to by Gerald of Wales who was traveling through north Wales in 1188 recruiting soldiers for the Third Crusade.According to Lloyd and Dr. Davies, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth represented the dynastically superior claim to the title of Prince of Gwynedd. Though Welsh law is silent on how an Heir apparent, the edling, would be determined; the position of a single Heir Apparent was recognized in Welsh law. At least since the succession of Gruffudd ap Cynan, and perhaps as early as the 9th century, the tradition of primogeniture was the regular method of succession to the princely title and throne, though junior sons were also provided for.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest Gwynedd between 1187–1200 pgs 160, 161, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth was raised in exile with his mother's Mathrafal family in Powys, primarily in the court of Powys Fadog in Maelor.The age of Majority in traditional Welsh law was at age 14, according to Lloyd (pg 161)Llywelyn ab Iorwerth may have been named after his deceased maternal uncle Llywelyn ap Madog, as the name 'Llywelyn' does not appear in any of the genealogies of the Aberffraw family before himLlywelyn's mother was Marared ferch Madog ap Maredudd ab Bleddyn of the Mathrafal House of Powys Fadog. (Or Margeret daughter of Madog son of Maredith) While Dafydd maintained his alliance with the English Crown, Rhodri allied with The Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, who was now the pre-eminent prince in Wales and now styled himself Princeps Wallensium, or Prince of the Welsh, in the tradition of Owain Gwynedd.Rhodri ab Owain married Gwenllian ferch Rhys, daughter of Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth in a diplomatic marriageWith the dynastic civil war in Gwynedd from 1170, and with the division of Powys into Powys Fadog and Powys Gwenwynwyn in 1160, the Lord Rhys was the most powerful of the independent Welsh princes. Rhodri was beset by his nephews Gruffudd and Meredudd ap Cynan, the two brothers ejecting Rhodri from Môn in 1190. That same year, Rhodri allied with Ragnvald Godredsson, King of the Isles, solidifying their alliance with a diplomatic marriage. By summer of 1193 Rhodri and a contingent of allied Manx forces recovered Môn, a period known as the 'Gaelic Summer' \\"so called, no doubt, because of the influx of Gaelic- speaking allies from Mann into Gwynedd\\", argued J.E. Lloyd. In 1194 the brothers Gruffudd and Meredudd ap Cynan recovered Môn ejecting Rhodri for the second time. Then they allied with their paternal cousin Llywelyn ab Iorwerth in his bid to reclaim his inheritance. Llywelyn and his allied cousins defeated their uncle Dafydd, the usurper Prince of Gwynedd, at the Battle of Aberconwy and taking lower Gwynedd.It is unclear what role Rhodri ab Owain (Dafydd's full brother) played in the campaign, whether he was allied with Dafydd or still in exile. The allies continued to win victories at Porthaethwy on the Menai and at Coedeneu on Môn. By 1195 Llywelyn controlled all of lower Gwynedd (the Perfeddwlad), with his cousin Gruffudd ap Cynan retaining Môn, and the commotes of Arfon, Arllechwedd, and Llŷn, and with Maredudd ap Cynan given Meirionydd and the lands just north as his share. Llywelyn pursued a policy of consolidation for the next five years, first with his capture of Dafydd in 1197, and then in 1198 when he sent a vanguard to the assistance of his then ally Gwenwynwyn of Powys in his campaign to take Painscastle; but it was Llywelyn's capture of Mold Castle in 1199 which was his most significant achievement at the close of the 12th century, argued Lloyd.Llywelyn was persuaded by the Archbishop of Canterbury to release Dafydd, with Dafydd and his family went into exile in England, where he held manors at Ellesmere and Halesowen. 13th century =Llywelyn, John, and the Magna Carta; 1200–1216= Llywelyn I the Great of Wales. Llywelyn I ruled Gwynedd and Wales from 1195–1240 In 1200 Llywelyn ab Iorwerth recovered upper Gwynedd on the death of his cousin Gruffudd ap Cynan, with Gruffudd's son Hywel swearing fealty to Llywelyn as his lord and receiving Meirionydd as his portion by 1202.Gruffudd ap Cynan took the habit of a monk at the Cistercian abbey at Aberconwy. Taking the habit near death was becoming increasingly popular among Welsh nobility, according to LloydMeredudd ab Cynan of Meirionydd had initially sworn fealty to Llywelyn in 1200 and received Llŷn, however was accused of conspiracy against Llywelyn and lost all possessions by 1202, with Meirionydd going to his nephew Hywel ap Gruffydd who had remained loyal to Llywelyn, according to Lloyd (A History of Wales, from The Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, page 177) As Llywellyn ruled over all of Gwynedd by the end of 1200, the English crown was compelled to endorse all of Llywellyn's holdings that year.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994 Llywelyn I relations with English crown pg 136 However, England's endorsement was part of a larger strategy of reducing the influence of Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of upper Powys, who had filled the power vacuum left with the death of the Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, in 1197; and with Gwynedd divided over the past generation.'Upper Powys' would become known as Powys Wenwynwyn after its ruler, Gwenwnwyn John of England had given William de Breos licence in 1200 to \\"seize as much as he could\\" from the native Welsh, particularly from Powys.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994 English policy in Wales pg 136, Hangs Welsh hostages pg 137 De Breos held lordship over Abergavenny, Brecon, Builth, and Radnor, and was one of the most powerful Marcher barons. However, de Breos was out of favor with King John by 1208, and with de Breos and the king quarreling Llywelyn took the opportunity to seize both southern Powys and northern Ceredigion.Davies provides John's relationship with de Breos as an example of his inconsistency in government (page 135, Davies, History of Wales) Llywellyn's expansion was a \\"bold demonstration of the determination of the ruler of Gwynedd to be master of Pura Wallia\\", and echoed historic Aberffraw claims as primary rulers of Wales since Rhodri the Great in the 10th century, argued John Davies.After de Breos was disgraced by King John, Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys launched a campaign to take as much as he could of de Breos marcher possessions. While Gwenwynwyn was campaigning against the Normans Llywelyn himself launched a campaign to take Powys Wenwynwyn under the guise of appeasing his father in Law, King John. Llywelyn had married the king's daughter Joan in 1204Ceredigion had been ruled by Maelgwn, an ally of Gwenwynwyn In his expansion, the Welsh prince was careful not to antagonise the English king, his father-in-law. Llywelyn had married Joan, King John's illegitimate daughter, in 1204.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Aberffraw primacy pg 116, patron of bards 117, Aberfraw relations with English crown pg 128, 135, 136 In 1209 Prince Llywelyn joined King John on his campaign in Scotland, a \\"repayment of an old debt\\", argued Davies, for Alexander I, King of Scots, had joined Henry I on his campaign against the Welsh in 1114. However, by 1211 King John perceived the growing influence of Llywelyn as a threat to English authority in Wales, and invaded Gwynedd reaching the banks of the Menai. Llywelyn was forced to cede the Perfeddwlad and recognize John as his heir if Llywelyn's marriage with Joan did not produce any legitimate successors. Welsh law recognized children born out of wedlock as equal to those in born in wedlock, and according to Welsh custom Llywelyn's eldest son Gruffydd, by his longtime companion Tangwystl, may have expected to be his father's heir.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Welsh law succession pg 136 Many of Llywelyn's Welsh allies had abandoned him during England's invasion of Gwynedd, preferring an overlord far away rather than one nearby.Davies, John, A History of Wales, By John Davies, Penguin, 1994 Welsh lords, John's policy to subject Wales, Magna Carta pgs 135–136 These Welsh lords expected an unobtrusive English crown, however King John had castles built in Ystwyth in Ceredigion, and John's direct interference in Powys and the Perfeddwlad caused many of these Welsh lords to rethink their position.Not Aberystwyth Castle, a later construction John's policy in Wales demonstrated his resolve to subject the Welsh, argued Professor John Davies. John of England signs Magna Carta. lustration from Cassell's History of England (1902). Llywelyn would have been among the assembled Llywelyn capitalized on Welsh resentment against King John, and led a church sanctioned revolt against him. As King John was an excommunicate in the Catholic Church, Innocent III gave his blessing to Llywelyn's revolt, possibly even lifting Pura Wallia from the interdict. Early in 1212 Llywelyn had regained the Perfeddwlad, striking at Marcher positions in Wales, and burned the castle at Ystwyth, with the Cronica de Wallia (Chronicle of Wales) recording that the Welsh lords chose Llywelyn as their 'one leader'.The Cronica de Wallia was 'probably' written in Whitland, Deheubarth, according to Davies Llywelyn's revolt caused John to postpone his invasion of France, with Philip II of France so moved as to contact Prince Llywelyn and propose that they ally against the English kingDavies, John, A History of Wales Penguin, 1994 Relations with France pg 136 King John ordered the execution by hanging of his Welsh hostages, the sons of many of Llywelyn's supporters John's relationship with his nobles deteriorated further following the king's disastrous campaign to reconquer Normandy and Anjou from France in 1213, with the nobles eager to ally with Prince Llywelyn. Llywelyn's aid to England's nobles, in particular Llywelyn's seizure of Shrewsbury in May 1215, was one of the major factors which persuaded John to seal the Magna Carta in June 1215. Llywelyn wrestled significant concessions from the English Crown in the Magna Carta. Land seized unjustly during the conflict would be returned to the other, and the primacy of Welsh law to apply in Pura Wallia (two-thirds of the surface area of Wales)- particularly with succession to land and title- was reaffirmed, and with Marcher Law to determine rights to land held in the March. The use of the term 'Marcher Law' in the Magna Carta was the first clear reference to the hybrid of Welsh and English law used in the march. The sealing of the Magna Carta did not end the conflict between John and England's nobles sparking First Barons' War, and Llywelyn continued to press his advantages in south and mid Wales by taking many English castles between 1215 and 1216, including the important Carmarthen and Cardigan castles among them. =Aberdyfi, Worcester, and Strata Florida; 1216–1240= Wales c. 1217. Yellow: areas directly ruled by Llywelyn; Grey: areas ruled by Llywelyn's vassals; Green: Anglo-Norman marcher lordships in Wales Llywelyn's influence was felt all across Wales as he aimed to give substance to the long-standing Aberffraw claim as the primary rulers of Wales.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Llywelyn receives homage of other lords, council of Aberdyfi pags 137–139 The prince used the structures of feudalism to strengthen his position, and between 1213 and 1215 received oaths of allegiance and homage from the rulers of Powys Fadog, Powys Wenwynwyn, Maelgwn of Deheubarth, and the Welsh in Gwent and the uplands of Glamorgan, and the Welsh barons in the region between the Wye and Severn. Additionally, Llywelyn threatened the long occupied Marcher positions in Haverfordwest in Pembroke, and the Braose controlled Swansea and Brecon. In 1216 Llywelyn convened the Council of Aberdyfi with all the Welsh lords in Pura Wallia in attendance. The choice of Aberdyfi as the place to hold the assembly was significant as the location was where Llywelyn's direct ancestor, Maelgwen the Great, had been recognized as overlord and king of Wales in the 6th century.Davies gives the name as Maelgwn Fwar, Malcome the Great, History of Wales page 138 At Aberdyfi, Llywelyn held court and presided over the division of Deheubarth between the descendants of Rhys ap Gruffydd,After the death of the Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, his sons fought for control of the principality. Under traditional Welsh law and custom, Maelgwn ap Rhys was his father's heir as Prince of Deheubarth as he was the eldest son, though Maelgwn was illegitimate in the eyes of the Catholic Church. However, the Lord Rhys had amended Welsh law as followed in Deheubarth by nominating his second son Gruffydd ap Rhys as his heir. Gruffydd has been born in a Church sanctioned marriage and the Lord Rhys had thought that Gruffydd would command more respect with his dealings with rivals if the stigma (stigma as considered in the wider Anglo-Norman polity) of illegitimacy was removed. This departure from traditional Welsh law caused friction in Deheubarth, with Maelgwn retaining significant support and was able to take Ceredigion, while Gruffydd was able to retain Ystrad Tywi. The inability of either brother to dominate Deheubarth effectively destroyed that principality, with both brothers becoming vassals of Gwynedd. Gruffydd died in 1201, and in 1216 Llywelyn presided over the full division of Deheubarth, with the eldest son of Gruffydd ap Rhys retaining Ystrad Tywi, while Maelgwn retained Ceredigion. with the rulers of Pura Wallia reaffirming their homage and oath of alliagence. Effectively all other rulers of Pura Wallia were mediatized and subsumed into the de facto Principality of Wales, according to Dr. John Davies. Author and historian Beverly Smith wrote of the Council of Aberdyfi, \\"Henceforth, the leader would be lord, and the allies would be subjects\\". However, when hostilities broke out between King John and his barons again later that year, Gwenwynwyn of Powys Wenwynwyn broke his oath of allegiance to Llywelyn and sided with the king. Llywelyn reacted by seizing Powys Wenwynwyn \\"in accordance with the rights of a feudal overlord\\", according to Davies. in 1216, King John died leaving his nine-year-old son Henry III as king of England; and the coalition against royal authority in England collapsed.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Llywleyn's reign pgs 138–143Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest pgs 199–203. The election Honorius III as pope, an ally of the House of Plantagenet, transferred the full weight of ecclesiastical Roman power away from the baronial party in favor of the royalists, with the pope now excommunicating all the barons who had previously sided against King John. Papal legat Guala Bicchieri pronounced the whole of Wales under interdict for Llywelyn's support of King Louis VIII of France, and the Welsh prince was deprived of valuable allies in the upcoming year.Llywelyn's allies included the knights of Glamorgan, Peter fitz Herbert, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, Thomas Corbet of Cause, John fitz Alan and Foulk fitz Warren, but most importantly that of Reginald de Braose in June 1217The Interdiction was read at Henry III's court at Bristol, with all of the Welsh bishops present, according to Lloyd \\"Each one\\", wrote Lloyd, \\"an ally lost to Llywelyn in his contest with the [English] Crown\\". Complicating matters was the successful recasting of the struggle from one of a civil war between the English King and his barons to one between the English against \\"foreign\\" French rule. Henry III's regents, including William Marshal, were anxious to reach a settlement with Llywelyn and endorsed much of Llywelyn's achievements after lengthy negotiations with the 1218 Treaty of Worcester. However William Marshal was also the Marcher Earl of Pembroke (by marriage to the de Clare heiress Isabel), and insisted on certain restrictions to curb Llywelyn's expansion. Llywelyn was not to retain the direct vassalage of the Dinefwr lords of Ceredigion and of Ystrad Tywi (Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychen), or of Powys, and Llywelyn could garrison the castles of Carmarthen and Cardigan only until Henry III came of age.Deheubarth was effectively divided with the Council of Aberdyfi between Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi, according to professor John Davies, from 1216 there cessed to bea Prince of Deheubarth after 1216 Nor was Llywelyn able to restore his ally Morgan ap Hywel to his ancestral seat of Caerleon in Gwent. However, because Powys' new lord Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn was himself in his minority, Llywelyn would be able to govern Powys and Maeliennydd until Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn came of age. Within five years English officials sought to reverse Welsh gains of the Treaty of Worcester, and in 1223 Earl William Marshal of Pembroke, now the rector of England, took the castles of Carmarthen and Cardigan.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Between Aberdyfi and the Middle Peace, pags 138–143 That same year Hubert de Burgh, justicar of England, ordered a more defensible castle to be built in Montgomery. However, as de Burgh sought to expand his influence in Powys he was met by Llywelyn and utterly trounced in battle at Ceri in 1228. De Burgh's defeat did not stop him from winning control of other Marcher lordships, further provoking Llywelyn. The Welsh prince led his armies into regions \\"where a Welsh army had not been seen for a century or more\\", wrote Davies. Llywelyn burned Brecon, marched through Glamorgan and destroyed Neath. Alarmed, Henry III appealed to Hiberno-Norman knights in Norman colonized Ireland and offered them any lands in Wales they might win from Llywelyn. However, Henry's efforts proved too ineffective against Llywelyn, and by 1232 the Peace of the Middle was signed restoring the Welsh prince to the position he enjoyed in 1216. With the Middle Peace, Llywelyn adopted a new title Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdonia, emphasizing his preeminent position as overlord of all Wales.The title Prince of Aberffraw referred to his family's claim as overlords of all Wales, while 'Lord of Snowdon' referenced the highest peak in WalesAccording to Lloyd, \\"[t]he Prince of Aberffraw held himself to be the natural lord of the prince of Dinefwr, and thus found justification in traditional lore for the acutal supremacy which he exercised.\\" The question of succession came to occupy much of Llywelyn's domestic and foreign policies following the 1216 Council of Aberdyfi. Llywelyn had an elder son, Gruffydd the Red, who according to Welsh custom was considered by many as the heir apparent.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Llywelyn designates Dafydd as heir, \\"triumph for legitimacy\\", page 222According to Lloyd, Gruffydd's \\"fiery and enterprising spirit\\", his place as Llywelyn's natural first-born son, and his birth to a Welsh noblewoman, made Gruffydd a popular figure amongst his contemporaries and traditionalists who objected to Llywelyn's amendment to Welsh law disinheriting Gruffydd. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Page 222.Though Gruffydd had been disinherited from the Crown and Throne of the principality, Llywelyn did entrust Gruffydd with a significant portion to rule. At first Gruffydd was given Maelienydd and Ardudwy to govern, however Gruffydd's misrule (Lloyd suggests Gruffydd was reckless and violent upon his own lands) lead to Llywelyn revoking those lands from Gruffydd in 1221. Back in favor by 1223 Gruffydd was in command of Llywelyn's forces in south Wales in 1223. But by 1228 Gruffydd was again out of favor and imprisoned for six years until 1233. Once back in favor, Lloyd (page 380, note 224) suggests Llywelyn intended Gruffydd to rule Powys Gwynwynwyn, but as a vassal to his brother Dafydd. By 1237, Gruffydd already seems to be ruling over the Powys cantrefs and commotes(lordships) of Arwystli, Cerri, Cyfeiliog, Mawddwy, Mochnant and Caereinion. However, the now defunct 1211 treaty,Defunct in the sense that Llywelyn was able to restore Welsh inheritance for lands in Pura Wallia in concessions won in the Magna Carta in which the English crown would only recognize legitimate issue born of Llywelyn and Joan as heirs of Gwynedd, demonstrated to Llywelyn the value the wider Western polity placed on legitimate birth. Additionally, Llywelyn's own successes, chiefly overcoming his usurper uncle, could be viewed as a triumph for legitimacy, argued Lloyd. Considering this, Llywelyn went to great lengths to secure the succession of his second but legitimate son Dafydd, born to Joan. In amending Welsh custom, Llywelyn had an example from which to draw from. The Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, had reached a similar conclusion about legitamcy in the latter part of the 12th century, and had set aside his eldest illegitimate son Maelgwn in favor of his legitimate second son Gruffydd. However, Rhys' untimely death in 1197 and the two Dinefwr brother's rivalry over the succession plunged Deheubarth into a disastrous civil war not settled until its full division in 1216. Llywelyn sought to avoid the pitfalls the Dinefwr example revealed and curried favor with his brother-in-law Henry III of England. Despite the occasional conflict between the Welsh prince and the English king, their personal relationship as brothers-in-law was not one of constant discord, and for the greater period between 1218 and 1240 there was a sense of amenity between the two. Henry III fully endorsed Dafydd as Llywelyn's heir, and in 1226 Henry III had successfully petitioned the Papacy to free his sister Joan from any stigma of illegitimacy. In 1229, Dafydd traveled to London to do homage for the lands he would inherit, and Llywelyn arranged for the advantageous marriage between Dafydd and Isabella de Braose, daughter and co-heiress of Llywelyn's powerful ally the Marcher lord William de Breos.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Dafydd II pg 139, 143-144According to John Davies, women played an important role in the creation of dynastic empires in the Welsh March. \\"The male line died out remarkably frequently among the families of the Marcher Lords and the marriages of co-heiresses played a key role in the dismemberment of the empires of their fathers.\\" Davies, History of Wales, page 141.Llywelyn had hoped that once his daughter-in-law Isabella bore Dafydd an heir, that Dafydd would be able to control all of south Wales through Isabella. However their marriage proved childless, and the de Broase holdings were divided amongst William's daughters who were co-heiresses and bore children.The marriage between Dafydd and Isabella was one of a series of advantageous marriages that Llywelyn arranged between his house and leading Marcher barons. Llywelyn's daughter Gwladus the Dark was married to Ralph de Mortimer, and the most powerful Marcher lord Earl Rannulf of Chester arranged for the marriage of his nephew and heir (John the Scot) to Llywelyn's second daughter Elen. The marriage between John the Scot and Elen proved to be childless, \\"a misfortune of importance in the history of Wales and Scotland\\", wrote Lloyd, for \\"[W]hen John the Scot died in 1237 his territories passed to the crown, and Edward I's campaign in Wales would be greatly facilitated by the fact that he held the earldom of Chester.\\" Shortly before 1238 Llywelyn, now aged 65, suffered a slight paralytic stroke.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Wales under the rule of Llywelyn and Llywelyn's death, pages 219-227 In an effort to assure a smooth transition from his rule to that of his son's rule, the prince assembled his vassals and bishops at the Assembly of Strata Florida in Ceredigion. The choice of Strata Florida as the venue for the ceremony was significant as a gauge of how complete the Aberffraw victory was in their claim as the primary princes of Wales and heirs of Rhodri the Great. The Cistercian abbey, founded in 1164, was under the patronage of the Dinefwr family, dynastically junior rivals (but also, at times, allies of necessity) of the Aberffraw family.Strata Florida was where the Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth and other Dinefwr family members were interned In a ceremony rich in feudal pageantry and with an act of homage reminiscent of Capetian France, the leading magnates of Wales swore fealty and allegiance to Dafydd as their future feudal overlord, suzerain, and prince.Dafydd had already been confirmed as Llywelyn's heir by the papacy in 1222, and in an earlier assembly of Llywelyn's leading magnetsin 1226 =Llywelyn's death and legacy= Prince Llywelyn of Wales at his death in 1240, with his sons Gruffydd and Dafydd mourning. Llywelyn is spelt Léolin above his head in the French manuscript. In weakened health, on 10 April 1240, Llywelyn abdicated in favor of his son Dafydd, had taken the monastic habit and entered into the Cistercian Abbey at Aberconwy. The next day Llywelyn died, with a Cistercian annalist writing \\"Thus died that great Achillies the Second, the Lord Llywelyn [...] whose deeds I am unworthy to recount. For with lance and shield did he tame his foes; he kept the peace for the men of religion; to the needy he gave food and raiment. With a warlike chain he extended his boundaries; he showed justice to all [...] and by the meet bonds of fear and love bound all men to him\\". Lloyd wrote that of all the Welshmen who fought against Anglo-Norman influence in Wales, Llywelyn's \\"place will always be high, if not indeed the highest of all, for no man ever made better or more judicious use of native force of the Welsh people for the adequate national ends; his patriotic statesmanship will always entitle him to wear the proud style of Llywelyn the Great\\". Though the prince was often engaged in conflicts, his battles were largely in Marcher controlled territories and directed against Marcher positions. For the greater period of Llewellyn's reign, the lands under his rule were at peace, a peace for which his vassals sought his protection. \\"Hardly a ripple disturbed the face of the waters [and] Welsh society followed the lines of its natural development\\", according to J.E. Lloyd.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Wales under the rule of Llywelyn, pages 219-226 The prince was an experienced and astute politician, according to Professor John Davies, whose legacy for Wales in law and government included the continued refinement and sophistication of his government's administration and with the legal system within the principality.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Llywelyn's Government and laws, page 142 Though the principality's archive has disappeared, what remains of Llywelyn's correspondence with English and French counterparts reveal that the prince's chancery produced documents of high quality in both Latin and in French, the lingua franca of the era, with the volume of documents increasing substantially after 1200. T. Jones Price notes that the Welsh principality was developing the prerequisites characteristic of a cohesive state, along similar lines to continental kingdoms such as France, Navarre, and León. As in England and elsewhere, the prince issued charters, diplomas, grants, and summons, each affixed with the prince's great seal. Political offices emerged from the prince's household, as in other realms, which formed the nucleus of the Welsh government. The distain was a kind of prime minister, the chamberlain as the treasurer, and with clerks as chancellors. Localized communities became increasingly dependent on the prince's administration, with the prince's appointed judges adjudicating and passing sentences at the commote court. Under the prince's patronage, Welsh law was further codified by the Welsh jurist Iorwerth ap Madog and published sometime around 1240, and known as the Book of Iorwerth, or the Iorwerth Redaction.Price, Hew, \\"Native Law and the Church in Medieval Wales\\", Oxford University Press, 1993, 2003, As with much of Europe, Wales remained predominantly rural at the turn of the 13th century, but Llywelyn encouraged the growth of quasi-urban settlements within the Welsh principality which served as centres of trade and commerce. Money grew in circulation, with freemen and nobles paying their taxes in the form of money rather than in produce, at least in the more fertile of the principality's commotes. interned at the Cistercian Abbey at Aberconwy, now the parish church for Conwy Llywelyn was no less influential in matters of the Welsh Church as he was in war and politics, and demonstrated that he was open to religious reforms and \\"accessible to new impulses and ideas\\", according to Lloyd. Llywelyn lent his support to Gerald of Wales' efforts in elevating St. David's into a metropolitan archbishopric with jurisdiction over the whole of Wales, though he would not directly benefit from having the Bangor diocese subject to it. Llywelyn secured the election of Welshmen to vacant Welsh dioceses, largely filled with Anglo-Normans following the Norman invasion of Wales.With the exception of the Bangor diocese, the other three were directly under the influence of Anglo-Norman patronage. The Deheubarth provance of Dyfed was overrun and occupied by Normans, with the Normans and English influencing the elections of bishops of St. David's from 1114 onwards. Morgannwg (Glamorgan) fell to the Normans in 1080, with bishops of Llandaff there subject to Anglo- Norman pressure thereafter. In 1140, the diocese of St. Asaph in lower Gwynedd (the Perfeddwlad) was carved out of the diocese of Bangor under the auspices of the Normans in order to rival the Bangor diocese, which remained under the influence of the Prince of Gwynedd. However, by 1216 Llywelyn's influence in Wales was so wide that he encouraged the election of Iorwerth, abbot of Talley (Abaty Talyllychau), as Bishop of St David's in 1214, the first Welshman elected and consecrated there in 100 years. In 1215, Llywelyn had encouraged the election of Cadwgan of Llandyfai, Cistercian abbot of Whitland Abbey (Abaty Hendy-gwyn ar Daf) and son of a famous Welsh priest, as Bishop of Bangor. Llywelyn befriended the monks of Ynys Lannog (Prestholm), who were not members of any religious order but \\"anchorites of the old Welsh pattern,\\" according to Lloyd. However it was the Cistercian order with its ascetic values approximating the Rule of Saint David of which Llywelyn became most fond of. The prince donated great tracts of land to the Cistercians, particularly in Cymer and Aberconwy. Additionally, Llywelyn patronized the Knights Hospitaller and donated lands to them at Dôl Gynwal, subsequently known as Ysbyty Ifan (Hospital of John), on the banks of the Conwy. Additionally, Llywelyn warmly welcomed the new order of Franciscans, who had come to Britain and Ireland only after 1200, to Wales. =Dafydd II, the Buckler of Wales; 1240–1246= Dafydd II succeeded his father with ease as he had the support of his father's chief advisors and the principality's leading magnates, including support from Ednyfed Fychan, Bishop Hywel of St. Asaph, and Einion Fychan.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, pgs 228-237 Dafydd's half-brother Gruffydd was closely guarded, and his supporters were all but silenced with the exception of his wife Senena and of Bishop Richard of Bangor who spoke publicly on Gruffydd's behalf. Shortly after his ascension, Dafydd attended the royal court in Gloucester where he performed homage for his inheritance and wearing Gwynedd's talaith, or coronet, the special symbol of his rank, according to Lloyd. However, though Dafydd's rule began auspiciously and in \\"peace and security\\", there were plots devised to reduce his and his house's influence, both in Gwynedd and over the whole of Wales. Claimants to the lands Llywelyn incorporated into his expanded principality petitioned the English king for redress. Diplomatic and legal battles ensued throughout 1241 as Dafydd agreed to put the matter of the disputed lands to a committee of arbitrators, partly English and partly Welsh, and headed by the pope's legate Otto. Collectively the arbitrators were deputized to adjudicate on the legal possessors of the lands in question. However, Dafydd subsequently failed to appear at three of the designated hearings, which delayed the proceedings. Patience exhausted, Henry III gathered a host and prepared to invade Wales in July and August in direct violation to the church sanctioned arbitration agreement. In the face of the military intervention before him, Prince Dafydd was almost bereft of any allies. Gruffydd ap Madog of upper Powys (son of Madog, who had been an ardent supporter and vassal of Dafydd's father Llywelyn), Maredudd ap Rhotpert, and Maelgwn Fychan all deserted him. Additionally, Henry III granted the petition of Senena, wife of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, to force Dafydd to release her husband from confinement and to be restored to a portion of Gwynedd as was due his inheritance. With the summer of 1241 remarkably dry, Dafydd found himself abandoned of yet another ally which, as Lloyd wrote, \\"rarely failed a Welsh chief in his hour of need, the Welsh climate.\\" Marshes dried up, rivers became fordable while lakes shrank into shallow pools, and the natural obstacles which usually made campaigning in Wales most difficult all but disappeared. Within four weeks Henry was at Rhuddlan and Dafydd agreed to submit before him. Henry would allow his nephew to retain the title and rank of prince, but otherwise the treaty terms were harsh. Gruffydd and his son Owain would be turned over to the king with the plan to have Gruffydd established as an independent ruler somewhere in North Wales as a counterweight to Dafydd. All of the conquests of Llywelyn, including of Meirionydd, Maelienydd, Mold, and of lower Powys, were returned to other claimants; and all homages of Welsh vassals were to be transferred back to the English crown. Dafydd was to pay for the expenses of the war (eventually having to cede Tegeingl and Deganwy, both in lower Gwynedd, to England to cover war expenses) and lost his inheritance of Ellesmere in England, his late mother's marriage dowry. Henry III repossessed Cardigan and Carmarthen in Deheubarth, while John of Monmouth occupied Builth, Dafydd's wife's dowry. Dafydd's ally Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg was forced out of Kidwelly and Widigada. Most importantly, however, Henry III insisted that Gwynedd would pass to the English crown if Dafydd II were to die without an heir. Gruffydd falling from the Tower of London Though Henry III did initially intend to install Gruffydd ‘somewhere’ in North Wales as a counterweight to Dafydd, in the end Henry \\"spared [Dafydd] the last humiliation\\" of dividing Gwynedd to share between the brothers, and Gruffydd and his son Owain were installed instead in the Tower of London, \\"trading a Welsh prison for an English one\\", wrote Lloyd. Gruffydd remained popular amongst some traditionalist Welsh, and a ‘legitimist’ faction had emerged to promote his rights above those of Dafydd. Henry III thought to keep Gruffydd as prisoner and as leverage against Dafydd for ‘good behavior’. If Dafydd were to rebel then Henry III would release Gruffydd into Gwynedd to attract his supporters and causing a dynastic civil war in Gwynedd. Dafydd's policy therefore was one of prudence and self-restraint as he maintained the status quo. Then, on St. David's Day 1244, in a daring escape attempt Gruffydd fell to his death when his improvised rope of torn bed sheets and table linens gave way as he tried to propel from the White Tower. Gruffydd's death released Dafydd from the threat of rival and within a few weeks the flag of revolt was flown across Wales. Dafydd emerged as the popular leader as he publicly lamented the indignant treatment of his brother, and with Gruffydd's second eldest son Llywelyn beside and supporting his uncle.Llywelyn the son of Gruffydd the Red, named after his grandfather Llywelyn the Great, remained with and was fostered by his uncle Dafydd, while the rest of Llywelyn's family was living in London to be near Gruffydd the Red in his Tower prison. The lesser Welsh lords again swore fealty to Dafydd as their leige lord, including the Dinefwr lords in Deheubarth. However, the two lords of upper and lower Powys, and Morgan of Gwenllwg, remained aloof to the revolt. The summer of 1244 emerged as one of unrest and strife as Dafydd stirred up his supporters the length and breadth of Wales. Nightly Welsh soldiers raided English positions, Diserth was under siege, and Powys’ province of Cyfeiliog was raided as punishment for Gwenwynwyn's support for the English king. In addition to military strikes on English positions, Dafydd opened a diplomatic offensive against the English crown by appealing directly to Pope Innocent IV, a \\"bold and original strategy\\", according to Lloyd. In his plea to the pope, Dafydd offered to hold the Welsh principality as a Papal vassal, noting that Rome had acknowledged his rights as heir. Dafydd's plan had precedents, according to Davies, as \\"by 1244 about a dozen European rulers have become direct vassals of the Papacy, and the Pope had proved his ability to make and unmake kingdoms.\\" While awaiting the Pope's reply, Dafydd had begun to style himself formally as Prince of Wales, denoting not only the popular monarchy over the Welsh which his earlier forefathers had taken with the title Prince of the Welsh and the title Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon, but over a clearly defined territorial principality incorporating the whole of Wales as distinct from England. A sympathetic Innocent IV appointed the abbots of Cymer and Aberconwy as papal commissioners charged with summoning Henry III to answer charges of wantonly casting aside arbitration in his 1241 campaign in Wales in favor of war. Henry III ignored the summons and sent his own envoy to Rome with the royal version of events, which sent word by 1245 transferring jurisdiction from the Welsh abbots to the Archbishop of Canterbury, \\"revealing not obscurely the influence of the weightier purse\\", according to Lloyd. Initially Henry took little interest in Dafydd's revolt as he was distracted by possible Scottish plans at an invasion in northern England, and deputized the marcher lords the earls of Gloucester and Hereford, and the two wardens of the March, John of Monmouth and John Lestrange, and later a contingent of knights under the command of Herbert fitz Mathew, with all five proving ineffective against the Welsh prince. Frustrated, Henry III released Owain the Red into Gwynedd, hoping that the affection Gruffydd had held among some Welsh would transfer to Owain and divide the Welsh in their loyalties. However, the Welsh fully backed Dafydd who continued to win victories in the spring of 1245. Herbert fitz Mathew was killed by a force of Welsh of Rhwng Nedd ac Afan, and though 300 Welsh soldiers were killed in an ambush near Montgomery, Dafydd took Mold castle on 28 March. Aberconwy Monastery, Dafydd II's perspective looking east across the river to Henry III's army at Deganwy. At low tide, both armies crossed the sands to skirmish Henry III began to realize that Dafydd was a far more formidable adversary then he had countenanced in 1241, and assembled an army in Chester by 13 August 1245. From Chester Henry's army pushed along the coast towards Degannwy, where he pitched camp on the 26th. Here, Henry remained for two months as he built up the fortress while exposing his army to the persistent attacks and harassments by the Welsh from across the Conwy River. Henry's army became demoralized, and, in one letter preserved by Matthew Paris, a soldier wrote, Henry's army, deep behind enemy lines, was ill provisioned by sea with the road from Chester routinely raided by Welsh skirmishers. As the summer turned to fall, the war raged on ruthlessly. English forces sacked the Cistercian Monastery of Aberconwy (now Conwy Castle), almost directly opposite the Conwy River from Degannwy, and executed Welsh hostages, including the young son of Ednyfed Fychan. In retaliation, the Welsh hung and beheaded their captives. Irish mercenaries in Henry's service raided Ynys Mon destroying the harvest. By late October Henry retreated from Degannwy and returned to England, his campaign of 1245 a failure. But if Henry's campaign was a defeat, Dafydd's wasn't a clear victory either, as Henry left behind a new castle at Degannwy which was- for Dafydd- a ‘throne in the eye’ and a clear sign by Henry for the speedy renewal of the war at another time. Before the war could be renewed, Dafydd II died at his court in Aber, 25 February 1246, survived by his wife Princess Isabella, but no heirs to transmit his claim to. The question of whether or not Prince Dafydd II could have maintained his position indefinitely against Henry III will always be uncertain, according to Lloyd, but what can be said of the prince was that during his brief rule he \\"showed himself, in courage, prudence, and leadership, no unworthy son of the great Llywelyn.\\" The chronicler mourned the loss of the buckler of Wales; and Dafydd Benfras set his harp to plaintive strains in honor of the fallen chief; > He was a man who sowed the seed of joy for his people, > Of the right lineage of kings,. > So lordly his gifts, ‘twas strange > He gave not the moon in heaven! > Ashen of hue this day is the hand of bounty > The hand that last year kept the pass of Aberconwy. > Dafydd's death left the native Welsh of all regions bereft of national leadership able to defend against the encroachment of their customs and way of life. Of the next ten-year period J.E. Lloyd wrote \\"[I]t was a time during which the sense of national solidarity was for the moment lost.\\" Llywelyn the Great and Dafydd's principality was all but dismembered, and Henry III was now firmly in possession of lower Gwynedd, the Perfeddwlad, while upper Gwynedd was on the verge of a dynastic civil war between the elder sons of Gruffydd the Red; Owain and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.Once Owain had heard of his uncle Dafydd’s death, he raced from England to Wales to press his claim as Prince of Gwynedd as senior line descendant of Rhodri the Great. =Woodstock, Montgomery, and Pipton 1246–1265= Brother versus brother; 1246–1255 As soon as he heard word of his uncle Dafydd's death, Owain the Red raced to Gwynedd to press his claim as prince as the senior dynast of the House of Aberffraw. According to Hurbert Lewis (The Ancient Laws of Wales, 1889), though not explicitly codified as such, the edling (or heir apparent) was by convention, custom, and practice the eldest son of the prince, who would inherit the position of head of the family. Owain was the eldest son of Gruffydd the Red, himself the eldest son of Llywelyn the Great, and thus had standing supporting his claim for the Crown of Gwynedd. However Llywelyn, the second son of Gruffydd, was already present in Gwynedd and had been raised in the household of his grandfather and uncle, and Llywelyn had attracted a loyal following who promoted him as the heir to the legacy of Llywelyn the Great and Dafydd. Leading Welsh magnets, those who had served as counselors for Dafydd and his father Llywelyn (amongst them was undoubtedly Ednyfed Fychan \\"rendering his country a last service ere his death,\\" suggested Lloyd) advised the brothers to wait until after the war to divide the commotes between them, as Welsh inheritance laws stipulated.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Years between 1246-1255, pgs 237-240 And there were other claimants to the principality as well, for according to the 1241 treaty between Henry III and Dafydd II, if Dafydd failed to produce a legitimate heir then his lands would pass to the English crown. Additionally, there was the claim under Marcher law of Ralph II Mortimer of Wigmore, husband of Gwladys the DarkGwladys the Dark and Ralph Mortimer’s descendants would include Edward IV and his daughter Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII, which prompted David Powel to claim in 1584 that Henry VIII inherited England from his father and Wales from his mother, according to Professor John Davies (History of Wales, page 141). (and later their son Roger II), who pressed Gwladys' claim to the principality as she was then the nearest living legitimate descendant to Llywelyn the Great and a full sister of Dafydd II.Warner, Philip, \\"Famous Welsh Battles\\", Barnes & Noble Books, 1997. \\"The Battles of Llywelyn the Last, pages 91-108\\"Gwladys was the daughter of Llywelyn and Joan, full sister to Dafydd II The brothers agreed to put the matter of division aside and for the remainder of the conflict they acted in concert. From the fall of 1246 through to the spring of 1247 no royal army attempted the hazards of Henry III's last campaign, but a Marcher vanguard led by Nicholas of Meules, seneschal of Cardigan and Carmarthen castles, pressed into Gwynedd. The two brothers fortified themselves in the Snowdonia mountains, but were compelledNicholas of Meules’ Marcher vanguard (joined by Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of lower Powys (\\"Powys Wenwynwyn\\")), crossed the Dyfi River and marched into Meirionydd and Ardudwy, then crossed into the Conwy river valley reaching Deganwy Castle without opposition. Though Meules failed to meet Owain and Llywelyn’s army, his unobstructed march into upper Gwynedd in regions which had not seen an invading army since the latter 11th Century compelled the brothers into truce negotiations. into truce negotiations in the late fall and early spring of 1247. With the Peace of Woodstock, 30 April 1247, the two brothers rendered homage to Henry III and were recognisedHenry III did not press his claim to upper Gwynedd as he seemed to doubt that he \\"had the ability to fully uproot the Welsh of north-west Wales,\\" according to John Davies (History of Wales, page 144). Similarly, the Marcher claim of Mortimer on behalf of Gwladys was also unenforceable to the men of upper Gwynedd. as the rightful rulers of upper Gwynedd in exchange for the services of twenty-four knights and one hundred foot soldiers,Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, From the Treaty of Woodstock to the Battle of Bryn Derwin, pgs 144/145 but had to abandon all claims to lower Gwynedd; namely the four cantrefs of Rhos, Rhufoniog, Tegeingl, and Dyffryn Clwyd; and also to Mold. Lastly, all homages of the minor lords of Wales were released.Additionally, the rights of certain Welsh supporters of Henry III were protected, including that of a Maredudd ap Rhicert, of unknown descent, who claimed a district in the Llyn cantref and who was supported by royal power, according to Lloyd (From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, page 237 Of the treaty, Matthew Paris wrote in 1247 that Wales had been pulled to nothing. Division of Gwynedd in 1247, dark gree Owain, light green Llywelyn, gold Dafydd (from 1252)Source: J. Beverley Smith With the Woodstock treaty, royal and Marcher authority had been reasserted and expanded upon in almost all corners of Wales, with significant gains for the English crown in Northern Ceredigion (particularly around Llanbadarn Fawr), Cardigan, Carmarthen, and Builth. In North Wales, Henry III fortified his positions in lower Gwynedd, and made Deganwy a chartered borough signifying the expansion of royal authority on the Creuddyn peninsula. Additionally, Henry III retained the earldom of Chester reassessing its strategic importance as a royal springboard into Wales.Llywelyn II the Great had developed a close friendship with Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, the most powerful of Marcher lords. Their constant friendship protected the principality’s eastern border. Rannulf’s heir was his nephew John the Scott, who was married to Llywelyn I’s daughter Elen. Their childless marriage and John the Scott’s death left Chester berift of lordship, which led it to fall into the English crown’s possession, according to John Davies, (History of Wales, page 141)Henry III had appointed Alan la Zouche as Justicar of Chester (replacing John de Grey) who pressed the Welsh under his authority with increased taxes, according to Lloyd, while Geoffrey of Langley represented royal authority in the Perfeddwlad In 1254 Henry IIII invested his16-yearold son Prince Edward with all the crown possessions in Wales.In addition to the crown possession in Wales, Edward was also invested with crown possessions in Ireland, Gascony, Cheshire. John Davies wrote, \\"Henry III made strenuous efforts to strengthen his hold upon Wales, efforts upon which Edward I would build twenty years later.\\" Following the war, Owain the Red (now Owain II) and Llywelyn divided upper Gwynedd between them in accordance with Welsh custom. Though the division of commotes was more or less equal, the value of each was weighted in favor of Owain II, whose share included important fertile farming regions on Ynys Môn and the Llyn peninsula, and the historic Aberffraw family seat. Llywelyn was apportioned Arfon, which included the Episcopal seat of Bangor, and west bank of the Conwy river valley then known as Arllechwedd and Nant Conwy, but two other of his holdings were desperately far from his center of power. The status que held until the summer 1255 when the relationship between the brothers deteriorated precipitously, probably over apportioning some of Llywelyn's land to their younger brother Dafydd. Owain II had previously granted Cymydmaen to Dafydd when he came of age in 1252 and demanded that Llywelyn, as the junior brother, also carve land out of his holdings for Dafydd, to which Llywelyn refused. Owain II and Dafydd gathered a host to force the issue, and led their armies through the mountain pass of Bryn Derwin. Waiting for them in the pass, Llywelyn pounced upon his brothers and in the space of an hour inflicted such a defeat that he took both of his brothers prisoners, and thereby becoming master over the whole of upper Gwynedd. With Llywelyn's victory he effectively usurped Owain II, who was now imprisoned in Dolbadarn Castle. Owain II remained popular with the people, with the bards protesting against his imprisonment. Owain was a man who is in the tower, long a guest, Hywel Foel laments and chides Llywelyn for not reconciling with his brother, does brother not forgive brother? It pertains only to God to dispossess a man. Also held captive by Llywelyn were both of his younger brothers, Dafydd and Rhodri.According to Lloyd (From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, page 258) Rhodri was kept imprisoned as a \\"difficult person\\", but a marriage had been arranged for him with an Irish heiress, but the plans fell through. Eventually Rhodri escaped his brother’s imprisonment and lived in exile in England. Rise of Llywelyn II Between 1255 and 1256 the people of lower Gwynedd were chafing under the heavy tax burden imposed by Geoffrey of Langley, a royal favorite and lieutenant in the region who sought to extend the English shire system there.According to author Philip Warner, Geoffrey of Langley had become a favorite of King Henry III and his son Prince Edward for his ability to raise money for the often cash-strapped royal treasury. Langley’s tactics included raising taxes and fines in the regions under his administration to extortion levels, and his use of mercenaries as henchmen to enforce his policies. Geoffrey of Langley had become detested in England and in Scotland for his ruthlessness, before his appointment as royal lieutenant in lower Gwynedd, the Perfeddwlad. Warner, Famous Welsh Battles, pg 94Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Career of Llywelyn the Last pgs 241-Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, From the Treaty of Woodstock to the Battle of Bryn Derwin, pgs 144-170 Prince Edward made a tour of his holdings of Chester as its earl, and then progressed into the Perfeddwlad to inspect his castles of Diserth and Deganwy. After Edward's departure, when it became clear to the Welsh of the region that the English prince was not inclined to intervene on their behalf over Langley's ‘tyrannous exactions,’ they rose in revolt and appealed to Llywelyn II for aid. Furthermore, Prince Edward appointed Patrick Chaworth as Steward of Carmarthen, an appointment that \\"could hardly be tolerated by Llywelyn who was already bitter and resentful\\" over the conditions in lower Gwynedd, whose people appealed for his deliverance. Having reconciled with Dafydd, Llywelyn II released his brother who he thought would be a valuable lieutenant, then gathered an army and crossed the river Conwy.Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg served as one of Llywelyn's lieutenants in the campaign. Maredudd had been ejected from Cantref Mawr in Ystrad Tywi by Rhys Fachan and his English allies. According to Lloyd, From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, page 242 Within one week Llywelyn II swept eastwards almost as far as Chester itself, stretching Gwynedd's princely domain \\"to its old bounds,\\" wrote Lloyd. Only the castles at Deganwy and Diserth were left as islets under siege in what was now \\"purely Welsh country\\" again. Prince Edward and his lieutenant Geoffrey of Langley, who had been in England during the week of Llywelyn's campaign, were powerless to respond as they, and the English crown, lacked any treasury for retaliatory measures against the Welsh prince.Henry III did obtain a loan from his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, but this proved useless. Additionally, Edward did lead a counter-offensive against Llywelyn with a host of Gascons, but after initial successes they were forced to retreat to Chester, according to author Philip Warner. And the English crown was abandoned by yet another ally against Llywelyn, the Marcher lords, who \\"sympathized with the insurgents as victims of a common tyranny, and the very barons of the March, hereditary foes of the Welsh, viewed their rebellion with toleration, if not actual friendliness,\\" wrote Lloyd. The Marcher lords were suspicious of growing royal authority over the March since the Peace of Woodstock. The inability of the crown to launch any response and the ambivilance so far expressed by other Marcher lords emboldened Llywelyn towards further campaigns. First, he recovered Meirionydd,Llywelyn II expelled Llywelyn ap Maredudd who had only lately inherited Meirionydd from his father recovered for Gwynedd the royal holdings of Lanbadarn and Builth,Llywelyn granted both Llanbadarn and Builth to Maredudd ab Owain as his vassal. then took Gwerthrynion from his cousin Roger II Mortimer. In South and West Wales, Llywelyn ejected Rhys Fychan from the Ystrad Tywi region and restored Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg to both Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychan. Llywelyn held his 1256 Christmas court at Aber, one which was \\"certainly not wanting in elements of festivity,\\" wrote Lloyd. In January 1257 Llywelyn harassed Powys Fadog, already ravaged from the prior year's campaigns, and then conquered Powys Wynwynwyn as far as Pool, driving out Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn.Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of upper Powys \\"Powys Wenwynwyn\\" took flight and sought aid from John Lestrange and John fitz Alan, \\"who could do nothing, however, but hold Montgomery,\\" wrote Lloyd. (Wales from the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, page 243) Pushing into Glamorgan, Llywelyn campaigned between the rivers Towy and Tawe where he enlisted the Welsh of the Gower, Kidwelly, and Carnwyllion to his side, thereby undermining the Marcher authority of the barons Patrick Chaworth and William de Braose. A hapless King Henry III sought the aid of his brother Richard, who had just been elected as Holy Roman Emperor, but though Llywelyn II and the emperor exchanged courteous and amicable correspondence, Llywelyn II refused to yield any of his conquests, but agreed to a long truce, one which allow Llywelyn to consolidate his gains. Before Easter 1257, Llywelyn was home in Gwynedd. The peace was short-lived as in West Wales Rhys Fychan enlisted Stephen Bauzan, the royal representative in South Wales, to campaign on his behalf to re-establish Rhys in Ceredigion. Bauzan's force set out from Carmarthen to Dinefwr where they were met by Llywelyn's vassals Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg and Maredudd ab Owain. During the Battle of Cadfan, Rhys Fychan unexpectedly changed sides and rode for the cover of Dinefwr Castle, leaving Bauzan and the English army to \\"beat a retreat, and a retreat under these circumstances soon became a rout, [and] at a place called Cymerau, a general attack was made by the Welsh, and the expedition, with its leader, was overwhelmed,\\" according to Lloyd. While Henry III made plans for the invasion of Wales, the Marcher castles of Laugharne, Llanstephan, and Narberth were captured by the Welsh, and Llywelyn stormed into South Wales to direct the campaigns personally. Llywelyn captured Newport Castle in Cemais and threatened Haverford, both in Pembrokeshire (historic Dyfed), and by mid July Llywelyn destroyed Earl Richard's castle of Llangynwyd. Llywelyn then returned north to shore up defenses in Gwynedd before Henry III's campaign: On 19 August 1257 Henry III set out from Chester into lower Gwynedd while his naval contingent from the Cinque Ports raised the sieges of Diserth and Deganwy. However, reinforcements from Norman Ireland failed to materialize, and Henry III was forced into an \\"ingloriously\\" retreat back to Chester chased by Llywelyn II, who harassed his flanks \\"cutting off all who fell behind the retreat,\\" wrote Lloyd. Henry III's campaign was \\"mismanaged,\\" according to John Davies, and would prove to be a costly venture to an already cash-strapped treasury. After a short truce which ended in April 1258, Henry III called upon his feudal host to assemble in Chester in preparations for yet another Welsh expedition when political sentiment in England shifted against Henry III's government and threatened to swell into a constitutional crisis. England's nobility was dutifully armed for campaigning when they gathered at Chester by 17 June, but they were not there for a renewed war but for redress against the misgovernment of Henry III. The war against Gwynedd was now completely eclipsed by the mounting domestic crisis in England. Meanwhile, the Welsh of Cemais and Peuliniog raided the lands of Earl William of Pembroke, with Earl William blaming the nascent 'reformer' party for spurring the Welsh into open revolt.

He played most of his club career for Blackburn Rovers, whose early embracing of professionalism enabled them to become one of the major teams in English football, and with whom he appeared on the winning side in five FA Cup finals (a joint record). He was the first professional player to appear for England for whom he made eleven appearances, as a half-back. Playing career Blackburn Rovers =Early days= Forrest was born in Blackburn and began playing football at school. By the time he was twelve, he was captain of local side Imperial United. He was first spotted by Blackburn Rovers when playing for Witton in 1880. By now he had left school and was working as a tape sizer in the cotton trade. After moving on to play for King's Own Blackburn, he was eventually persuaded to join Rovers in January 1883. At this time there was no organised league system, and Blackburn were restricted to friendly matches and cup tournaments, especially the Lancashire Senior Cup and the FA Cup, in which they had been finalists in 1882. In his first season with Rovers, they reached the FA cup final with easy victories in the early rounds over Southport Central (7–0), South Shore (7–0), Padiham (3–0) and Staveley (5–1), before meeting Upton Park in the fifth round. This match was won 3–0 and was followed by a 1–0 semi-final victory over Notts County, thus setting up a final appearance against Scottish club Queen's Park, who had defeated Rovers' local rivals, and cup holders, Blackburn Olympic in the semi-final. Forrest was called up for his first England cap for their final match in the inaugural British Home Championship against Wales on 17 March 1884, still aged only 19, replacing Notts County's Stuart Macrae at left half. According to Philip Gibbons in \\"Association Football in Victorian England\\", \\"the Welsh had few answers to the skilful England forwards\\" and England won by four goals (including a pair from William Bromley-Davenport) to nil. In the cup final, played at the Kennington Oval on 29 March, Rovers lined up against a Queen's Park side, most of whom were Scottish internationals.Ironically, Scotland faced Wales in their last match in the 1884 British Home Championship on the day of the cup final and were forced to field a reserve eleven. After half an hour of play in the final, Forrest (who was playing at right-half) \\"delivered an excellent pass\\" to Jimmy Brown who rounded two defenders prior to crossing the ball into the Queen's Park goalmouth. The goalkeeper, George Gillespie, was unable to clear the ball which fell to Joe Sowerbutts who had only to apply the gentlest touch to help the ball between the posts. Shortly after, William Anderson thought he had scored for the Scots but the goal was disallowed for offside by referee Francis Marindin. Forrest then scored Blackburn's second goal – after the ball was partially cleared by Gillespie it fell to Joe Lofthouse who returned it into the goalmouth where Forrest was waiting to put the ball in the net. Forrest was almost certainly offside but, in the absence of an appeal by the Scots, Mandarin allowed the goal to stand. By half-time, Queen's Park had pulled a goal back through Christie. In the second half, both sides had goals disallowed for offside, but there was no further score, and Blackburn Rovers took the cup for the first time. Forrest was aged 19 years and 277 days when he scored his first FA Cup final goal, making him the youngest FA Cup Final scorer at the time, a record he retained for 75 years, until Dicky Dorsett scored for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the 1939 FA Cup Final. In the 1884–85 FA Cup, Blackburn again came through the early rounds without difficulty, with a victory over Rossendale (11–0) before meeting local rivals, Blackburn Olympic in the second round. Rovers won the derby match 3–2 in a tight game with a brace from Howard Fecitt and a third from Joe Sowerbutts. Rovers then easily went past Forrest's old club Witton (5–1) and Romford (8–0); a bye in round five saw them through to a sixth round meeting with West Bromwich Albion. This resulted in a 2–0 victory for the cup holders, who then met Old Carthusians in the semi-final, played on 7 March 1885. Rovers had little difficulty getting past the Old Boys 5–1 to set up a repeat of the previous year's final against Queen's Park, who had come through replayed matches against Notts County and Nottingham Forest in their last two rounds. A week before the semi-final, Forrest was selected for the Home Championship match against Ireland, together with his Rovers teammates, Herby Arthur, Joe Lofthouse and Jimmy Brown. England beat the Irish with ease by four goals to nil, including a goal each from Lofthouse and Brown. The Rovers quartet retained their places for the next match, against Wales, played on 14 March at Leamington Road, Blackburn. England were \\"disappointing\\" and Wales returned home with a well-deserved 1–1 draw. The next England match was a week later on 21 March against Scotland to be played at The Oval. Forrest and his three Blackburn colleagues were again selected for England. The Scottish officials complained as they argued that Forrest was a professional. At the time he was receiving £1 a week from Blackburn Rovers. Forrest was eventually allowed to play but he had to wear a different jersey from the rest of the team. Blackburn Rovers also had to agree not to pay him his wages in the week that he played for England, thus enabling Forrest to become the first professional to play for England. The match itself ended 1–1, with England's equalizer coming from Charlie Bambridge, thus allowing the Scots to claim the championship. The 1885 FA Cup Final, played at the Oval on 4 April, was against Queen's Park, whom Blackburn had beaten in the previous year's final. This time there was little controversy and it was soon clear that Rovers were the superior side, even though Queen's Park fielded six players who had appeared in the England versus Scotland match two weeks earlier. After 14 minutes, Forrest got the better of his marker Charles Campbell and was able to fire Rovers in front from close range, after Jimmy Brown's shot had come back off the goal-posts. Although Walter Arnott did put the ball in the net just before half-time, referee Francis Marindin disallowed the \\"goal\\" for handball. The Scots continued to attack, but Rovers increased their lead on 58 minutes when Brown, \\"who had played throughout like a man inspired\\", added a second goal. From this point, Rovers controlled the game, and Queen's Park's efforts were to no avail. After the final whistle, the Scottish team were a little unhappy that Rovers had fielded players, including Forrest, whose amateur status was questionable – despite this, there was little doubt that professionalism was here to stay. During the summer of 1885, there was further pressure put on the Football Association to accept professionalism, culminating in a special meeting on 20 July, after which it was announced that it was \\"in the interests of Association Football, to legalise the employment of professional football players, but only under certain restrictions\\". Clubs were allowed to pay players provided that they had either been born or had lived for two years within a six-mile radius of the ground. There were also rules preventing professional players playing for more than one club in a season, without obtaining special permission, and all professional players had to be registered with the FA. The new rules caused problems for some clubs in the 1885–86 FA Cup tournament, especially those who had recruited large numbers of players from Scotland. Leading teams, including Bolton Wanderers and Preston North End, were disqualified for fielding ineligible players. As a consequence, many minor teams were able to progress into the later rounds, including Brentwood who Blackburn Rovers met in the sixth round. A 3–1 victory took Rovers through to a semi-final against the last surviving totally amateur side, Swifts who included England internationals Charlie and Arthur Bambridge, and George Brann. Despite this, Swifts presented no more of a challenge than Rovers' earlier opponents and after a 2–1 victory in the semi-final, played at the County Cricket Ground, Derby on 13 March 1886, they were through to the final, where they were to meet West Bromwich Albion. Forrest was prevented from playing for England against Ireland in the opening match of the 1886 British Home Championship as this was played on the day of the FA cup semi- final. He regained his place for the next matches, against Scotland on 27 March 1886 which ended 1–1 and Wales two days later, which was won 3–1. The 1886 FA Cup Final against West Bromwich Albion was played at the Kennington Oval on 3 April 1886. Although Blackburn fielded seven players who had appeared in the two previous finals, whereas Albion had reached the final for the first time, the two sides were evenly matched and the game ended goalless. The replay took place at Derbyshire County Cricket Club's Racecourse Ground in Derby, the first time an FA cup final had been played outside London. Although Albion started the match continually attacking the Rovers goal, eventually Blackburn's experience began to show. Joe Sowerbutts added to his goal in the 1884 final by scoring the first after 26 minutes before Jimmy Brown, who had scored in the 1885 final added a second with seventeen minutes to go. Blackburn Rovers had thus become one of only two clubs (the other was Wanderers) to win the cup in three consecutive seasons. Blackburn Rovers started their campaign to claim the FA cup for a record fourth time with a bye as their first round opponents Halliwell withdrew. In the second round, they were drawn to play in Scotland against the previous season's Scottish Cup finalists, Renton based in the village of Renton, West Dunbartonshire. The first match ended in a 2–2 draw with Renton causing one of the biggest shocks for years when the Scottish club won the replay 2–0. Forrest was selected for all three matches in the 1887 British Home Championship. The matches against Ireland and Wales resulted in easy victories with scores of 7–0 and 4–0 respectively, but in England's final match of the tournament against Scotland played at Leamington Road, Blackburn on 19 March 1887 the Scots won 3–2 and went on to claim the championship. In the 1887–88 FA Cup campaign, Rovers had an easy passage through the early rounds with victories against other Lancashire clubs, including Blackburn Olympic (5–1), Accrington (3–1) and Darwen (3–0), before they were drawn against Derby Junction who were appearing in the FA cup for the first time. Rovers were defeated 2–1 in the sixth round match which was played at the Derby Arboretum. As a result of Rovers' relative lack of success, none of their players were selected to represent England in the 1888 British Home Championship, with Forrest losing his place to Wolverhampton Wanderers's Harry Allen. =Football League era= In the spring of 1888 the leading professional clubs in Lancashire and the West Midlands agreed to inaugurate a league tournament to develop the level of competition between clubs above friendly matches and appearances in cup tournaments. The new league was set up following meetings at Anderson's Hotel in London on 23 March 1888 on the eve of the 1888 FA Cup Final followed by a further meeting on 17 April at Manchester's Royal Hotel. The first season of the new Football League began a few months later on 8 September with Blackburn Rovers as one of the twelve original member clubs. Rovers' first league game took place on 15 September 1888, at Leamington Road, then home of Blackburn Rovers, when they shared ten goals in a \\"thrilling\\" match with Accrington. Jimmy Forrest scored his debut League goal on 3 November 1888 at Turf Moor, Burnley when Blackburn Rovers defeated Burnley 7–1. Forrest made 19 league appearances, all at left-half, and scored one League goal. As a wing-half he played in a midfield that achieved big (three-League-goals-or-more) League wins on five separate occasions. (registration & fee required) as Blackburn finished the first league season in fourth place, a long way behind the champions Preston North End, who were now by far the strongest club in England, justly earning them the title of \\"The Invincibles\\". In the FA cup, after a victory over Accrington and a \\"walkover\\" past Swifts, Blackburn defeated Aston Villa 8–1 in the third round (with four goals from Jack Southworth) before going out in the semi-final to Wolverhampton Wanderers after a replay. Forrest was recalled to the England team for the match against Scotland on 13 April 1889 which ended in a 3–2 victory for the Scots. The 1889–90 season saw a modest improvement in Rover's league performance with a third-place finish, with Forrest only missing one match. The FA cup saw victories over Sunderland and Grimsby Town, before defeating Bootle 7–0 in the third round, with a hat-trick from Nat Walton. The semi-final saw a re-run of the previous year's match against Wolves, but this time Rovers reached the final with a 1–0 victory with Southworth the scorer. Before the cup final, Forrest (together with Rovers teammates Billy Townley, Joe Lofthouse, John Barton and Nat Walton) was selected for the England match against Ireland on 15 March 1890. Because of the crowded fixture list, England also played a match against Wales on the same day. The match against Ireland ended in a 9–1 victory for England, with a hat-trick from Fred Geary. This was Forrest's final appearance for England, in an international career which spanned seven seasons in which he played eleven times, with six victories, three draws and two defeats, both against Scotland. The cup final was played at the Kennington Oval on 29 March 1890 against The Wednesday who were the champions of the Football Alliance which had been set up to provide competition for clubs excluded from the Football League. Rovers put out a team of players most of whom were England or Scotland internationals, although Wednesday had England internationals Teddy Brayshaw and Billy Betts in their defence. From the kick- off, the Rovers forwards had the Wednesday defence under pressure which led to Jack Dungworth handling the ball on the edge of his goal area in the sixth minute. Forrest took the free kick which fell to Billy Townley whose shot took a deflection for the first goal. Further goals from Nat Walton and Townley gave Rovers a 3–0 lead at half-time. The second half continued with Rovers on top with Jack Southworth adding a fourth goal in the fiftieth minute before Albert Mumford was able to score for Wednesday. Further goals from Townley and Joe Lofthouse in the last 15 minutes gave a winning scoreline of 6–1 to Rovers. Townley had thus become the first player to score an FA cup final hat- trick. According to Gibbons, \\"the Blackburn side had given one of the finest exhibitions of attacking football in an FA cup final, with England internationals Walton, Townley, Lofthouse and John Southworth at the peak of their form.\\" Forrest continued to play at the centre of Blackburn's defence for the 1890–91 season, forming a settled half-back line alongside fellow internationals Jack Barton and Geordie Dewar. Forrest only missed one league game as Rovers ended the campaign in sixth position. Once again, Rovers' priority was in the FA cup. In the first round they went past Middlesbrough Ironopolis 3–0 in a replayed match to set up a meeting with Chester in the second round. Jack Southworth netted his fourth hat-trick of the season in a 7–0 victory over his former club. Victories over Midlands clubs, Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion set up Rovers' sixth appearance in the cup final, to be played at The Oval on 21 March 1891, against Notts County who had defeated Rovers 7–1 in the penultimate league match on 14 March. Despite this Rovers were expected to win the final as they were the holders and fielded seven of the previous year's winning side, including Forrest, already with four cup winners medals. Blackburn dominated the early stages of the game with Dewar scoring after eight minutes. Goals from Jack Southworth and Billy Townley gave a half-time score of 3–0 to Rovers. Although County pulled a goal back in the second half, Rovers were able to defend their lead and thus claimed the cup for the second consecutive year, the fifth time overall. Forrest thus became the third player to win five FA cup finals, after Arthur Kinnaird and Charles Wollaston. Rovers' defence of the FA cup faltered at the second round stage where they suffered their first cup defeat for three seasons, against West Bromwich Albion, who went on to claim the trophy in the final. The half-back line-up of the previous season was broken up as a result of injuries to Barton and Dewar, and Rovers finished the 1891–92 season in ninth place having conceded 65 goals, with only Accrington and Darwen conceding more. For the 1892–93 season, Barton was replaced by Geordie Anderson and the trio of Forrest, Anderson and Dewar were to remain at the heart of the Rovers' defence for the next three seasons, during which their league campaigns ended with finishes in ninth, fourth and fifth places respectively. Although Rovers reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1893 and 1894, their cup-winning exploits were over until 1928. Forrest remained at Rovers until October 1895, when there was an acrimonious parting of the ways; Forrest claimed that the committee at Rovers had asked him to revert to amateur status to save paying him a wage, a charge that was vigorously denied by the club. He moved to Darwen after twelve eventful seasons which had not only seen five FA cup victories, but also the move from amateur to professional football and the creation of the Football League. Darwen Forrest joined Second Division Darwen in time for the 1895–96 season. One of the first games he played for his new club was against Rovers in a friendly at Barley Bank. He played for Darwen for one season scoring one goal before retiring from the game. Later career After his playing days ended, Forrest became licensee of the Audley Arms Hotel in Blackburn before becoming the landlord of the County Arms on Darwen Street, Blackburn for many years. He later joined a firm of shuttle peg makers, joiners and mill furnishers. He returned to Blackburn Rovers as an administrator, before becoming a director of the club in 1906. His son, James Henry Forrest, played for Rovers for four seasons in the 1920s. Jimmy Forrest died on 30 December 1925, aged 61. Footnote: One source described Jimmy Forrest as an industrious half-back, whose tough tackling was matched by an intelligent reading of the game that enabled him to anticipate danger and intercept the ball before the opposition could fully develop an attack.

Its begins at Iowa 415 in Ankeny and ends at exit 90 of Interstate 35 (I-35) in Ankeny. Originally ending at a Y intersection, south of the current intersection with Iowa 415, the route has been straightened to run west and east. Iowa 160 passes Des Moines Area Community College near its intersection with U.S. Route 69 (US 69). Route description Iowa Highway 160 begins at a stoplight intersection with Iowa 415 on the southwestern edge of Ankeny. Iowa 415 comes from the south and leaves to the west, Iowa 160 begins to the east, and Ankeny's State Street continues north. Iowa 160, known locally as Oralabor Road, meets DMACC Boulevard just from its western end and forms the southern border of the Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) campus. Iowa 160 passes businesses to the south and the DMACC campus landscape to the north before intersecting US 69, known locally as Ankeny Boulevard. East of US 69, the highway separates the commercial area to the south from the residential areas to the north. A single-track Union Pacific Railroad line serves as another dividing line as Iowa 160 enters a purely commercial area for the remainder of its length. Just from its eastern end, it intersects Delaware Avenue, a north–south street which diverts retail traffic exiting from I-35 just to the east. Iowa 160 ends on an overpass of I-35, at exit 90. History Iowa Highway 160 was designated in 1947 as a diagonal connector route from Iowa Highway 60, now Iowa Highway 415, to U.S. Route 69. Iowa 160's original west end was a Y intersection, with Iowa 60 coming from the south and heading northwest and Iowa 160 heading northeast. In 1980, Iowa 160 was extended from US 69 to I-35.

A guitar player with a signature Fender to his credit and praised by his fellow guitar players and guitar magazines, his playing is regularly compared to Stevie Ray Vaughan's.\\"'I Don't Believe' was a funk-based ninth-chord workout, spiced with some Hendrix-like motion on [Dave Gonzales]' low strings. The churning 'What Side of the Door Am I On?' and 'Years Since Yesterday' both showed a strong [Stevie Ray Vaughan] influence. Gonzales' excursions on his '50s Guild arch- top guitar were scarcely less impassioned than the late master's. Gonzales' vocals--sometimes merely well-intentioned in years past--are now nearly as fierce as his guitar work.\\" \\"Some industry wags were predicting that [Dave Gonzales] would become the next Stevie Ray Vaughan.\\" Career The Paladins The Paladins were founded in the early 1980s and are still active, though sporadically so. They put out a number of studio albums, but made their reputation on the road, touring constantly in the US and abroad. The Hacienda Brothers In 2003 Dave Gonzalez and fellow veteran musician Chris Gaffney founded the western soul band The Hacienda Brothers. The band received critical recognition for their self-titled debut album and were nominated in 2007 for \\"Group of the Year\\" by the Americana Music Association. Their third and last album was wrapped up early 2008, but Chris Gaffney died on April 17, 2008, of liver disease. Dave Gonzalaz oversaw the final production and release of the album, Arizona Motel. In the summer of 2008, Gonzalez organized \\"a kind of Hacienda Brothers farewell tour as a tribute to Gaffney,\\" with Dave Alvin as a featured guest for a show in San Francisco. Dave Gonzalez with the Hacienda Brothers at Byron Bay Bluesfest in Australia, Easter 2007 Guitar accolades Gonzalez made the list of the \\"101 Forgotten Greats & Unsung Heroes\\" selected by Guitar Player: Equipment Gonzalez plays guitars that reflect his love for the 1950s: a 1953 Gibson and a 1953 Gretsch, and formerly a late-1950s Silvertone. He is endorsed by Fender, which made a Signature Model and as a nod to Gonzalez called it the Guild Paladin (X-550). It was modeled from an original 1957 Guild that Gonzalez played while with the Paladins; it had been refretted so often that, Gonzalez says, the frets \\"just wouldn't stay in anymore.\\" His amplifiers with the Paladins were a Fender Bassman (with four 10\\" speakers) and a Fender Super Reverb, and he used an Echoplex. After he started playing (with Chris Gaffney) in a more country- oriented style, he switched guitars, adopting a number of Fender Telecasters, including a \\"killer gold-sparkle Buck Owens Tele.\\" He also plays a baritone guitar, a Fender Jazzmaster with a Fender Bass VI neck made at the Fender Custom Shop. The guitar has thick strings, from 0.14 to 0.70, and is tuned to A. He also changed amplifiers, since he played too loud for the Hacienda Brothers, and switched to a Fender Vibrolux.

Area code 818 was created in a split from area code 213 on January 7, 1984. On June 14, 1997, area code 818 was split to form area code 626 for most of the San Gabriel Valley. On May 18, 2009, area code 747 went into service as an overlay. History After the standardization of American telephone area codes in 1947, almost all of Los Angeles County used the 213 area code. Because the population and phone usage of the Los Angeles metropolitan area greatly increased during the 1980s and 1990s, the 213 area code was split into several new area codes, including the 818 and 310 area codes. The 818 area code entered service on January 7, 1984, making Los Angeles one of the first major cities to be split between multiple area codes. Area code 626 was carved out of the eastern portion on June 14, 1997. In November 1999, it was proposed that \\"at some future date\\", a new 747 area code would split from 818, the new 747 serving the southern and western portions of the San Fernando Valley. This proposal sat dormant until 2007, when the telephone industry and the California Public Utilities Commission began studying implementing this 818/747 split, or possibly an overlay of all of 818 with 747. Public hearings were held, and the overall public sentiment was for an overlay rather than the split, since they could retain the 818 area code for their existing telephone numbers. The new 747 area code would be used for numbers associated with new service. On April 24, 2008, the CPUC decided that area code 747 would overlay area code 818 effective May 18, 2009.NPA 747 to Overlay NPA 818 From that date, new numbers could be assigned to the new area code. Callers within the 818 and 747 area codes would be required to dial the area code (including calls to the same area code; cell phones could dial with or without the \\"1\\" prefix) for all calls. There was a grace period starting October 11, 2008 during which callers could still complete calls using the seven-digit number. Since mid-April 2009, calls must be dialed with the area code and number; otherwise, the call will not be completed (cell phone users can omit the \\"1\\").

Because of this conflict, some outgoing calls from VoIP networks using a 10-digit SIP address could have been mistaken for calls originating from the actual 747 area code. These addresses are no longer in use as Gizmo5 service was discontinued as of April 3, 2011.

Cervera is the capital of the comarca of Segarra, in the province of Lleida, Catalonia. The title specifically represents the heir to the Kingdom of Valencia, a part of the Crown of Aragon. The title was created on 27 January 1353 by Peter IV of Aragon for his son and heir, the infante John, who was later John I of Aragon. The title, which Peter claimed as Count of Barcelona, passed in the Crown of Aragon; it has been united with the Aragonese title Prince of Girona since 1414, after which its history may be traced under that title. The Crown of Aragon and its institutions were formally abolished after the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1713) with the accession of the first Bourbon king of Spain, by the Nueva Planta decrees, under which all the lands of Aragon were incorporated, as provinces, into a united Spanish administration, as Spain moved towards a more centralized government under the new Bourbon dynasty. By royal decreeRD 54/1977, BOE del 22 de enero de 1977 from 21 January 1977, the hereditary titles of the former Crown of Aragon have been invested in Don Felipe de Borbón, naming him \\"Prince of Asturias and other titles historically related to the Heir to the Crown of Spain\\". In the question of succession the Spanish Constitution of 1978 (Title II, art. 57.2) indicates: \\"The Heir to the Throne, from his birth or the fact that causes his call, has the rank of Prince of Asturias and other titles traditionally linked to the Heirs to the Crown of Spain\\". In 1996, on the occasion of an official visit to Cervera Prince Felipe assumed the title in a public ceremony.

Barney was among the first women to graduate with an engineering degree in United States. Given an ultimatum to either stay a wife or practice engineering she chose engineering. She was the granddaughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Early life She was born Nora Stanton Blatch in Basingstoke, Hampshire, England in 1883 to William Blatch and Harriot Eaton Stanton, daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She studied Latin and mathematics at the Horace Mann School in New York, beginning in 1897, returning to England in the summers. The family moved to the United States in 1902. Nora attended Cornell University, graduating in 1905 with a degree in civil engineering. She was Cornell University's first female engineering graduate. Pioneering women in STEM www.nsf.gov, accessed 28 February 2020 In the same year, she was the first woman admitted (accepted as a junior member) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

She was the first female member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where she was allowed to be a junior member only and denied advancement to associate member in 1916 solely because of her gender. At the time, women were only admitted as junior members. In 1916, she sued the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) for refusing to admit her as a full member, even though she met all requirements. Blatch lost, and no woman became a full ASCE member for a decade. In 2015, she was posthumously advanced to ASCE Fellow status. Marriage to Lee De Forest In 1908, she married the inventor Lee de Forest, and helped to manage some of the companies he had founded to promote his invention and the new technology of wireless (radio). The couple spent their honeymoon in Europe marketing radio equipment developed by de Forest. However, the couple separated only a year later, due largely to de Forest's insistence that Nora quit her profession and become a conventional housewife. Shortly afterward, in June 1909, Nora gave birth to their daughter, Harriot. In 1909, she began working as an engineer for the Radley Steel Construction Company. She divorced de Forest in 1911. After her divorce, she continued her engineering career, working for the New York State Public Service Commission. Later life In 1919, Nora married Morgan Barney, a marine architect. Their daughter, Rhoda Barney Jenkins, born July 12, 1920, in New York, was an architect and social activist. Nora continued to work for equal rights for women and world peace, and in 1944 authored World Peace Through a People's Parliament.

He served in the war following the Disaster of Curalaba and the great Mapuche uprising that followed in Chile that resulted in the loss of all the Spanish settlements south of the Bio Bio River. He was sent back to the royal court in Spain to argue for a reform to the way the war against the Mapuche was fought. Nájera's arguments for his reforms were incorporated in his book of Desengaño y reparo de la Guerra del Reino de Chile (Disappointment and Reparation of the War of the Kingdom of Chile).  Biography  There is no information on his life before 1600. It is only known that he served in the Spanish army in Flanders and then in France. On November 13, 1600, he left Lisbon for Chile with the rank of captain under the command of Francisco Martinez de Leiva. He arrived in Mendoza in May 1601, afterward moving to the south of Chile, where he remained until 1607. Alonso de Ribera, Governor of the Captaincy General of Chile, founded the fort Nacimiento on the banks of the Bio Bio near the confluence with the river Vergara, December 24, 1603. Gonzalez, Najera was responsible for building it and was its first garrison commander. After four years of military service in the war zone, he was appointed sargento mayor by the newly appointed Governor Alonso García Ramón in 1605. He later returned to Santiago sick and wounded in his leg, as a result of his participation in the war. Because of the critical military situation in Chile, Governor Ramon Garcia decided to send González de Nájera to Spain to report to King Philip III on the true state of the territory. The choice of González was based on his long years of experience and skilled, zealous service to the king in many prominent posts and positions in the army. In May 1607, he departed for Spain, where he arrived at the end of the next year. To record the critical situation that lived in Chile, and to convince the Council of the Indias and the King to send relief to Chile, he drafted and presented some considerations which were later transformed into the fifth and sixth points of his book Desengaño y reparo de la Guerra del Reino de Chile. In the Court, Gonzalez de Najera made a series of recommendations on how to continue the war. He pointed out the weaknesses that the current methods used in the war suffered, especially the system of \\"campeadas\\" or incursions that the Hispanic army made in Mapuche territory to burn their fields and to hunt them for slaves. He not only set out his criticism, but proposed to establish a new system to complete the conquest of the Mapuche territory and to finish with the war. This consisted of the creation of a line of forts that separated both territories, a professional army that operated from them towards the interior of Mapuche territory, the extermination of the natives who were to be hunted as slaves and their replacement by black slaves from Africa, apparently considered less rebellious than the Mauche. However, he was not heard and the Governors request for relief did not succeed. The actual decision was to impose Luis de Valdivia's system of defensive war, contrary to what was suggested by Gonzalez de Najera. However his merits were recognized and he was appointed Governor of Puerto Hércules in Tuscany, where he finished his life sometime in 1614 although the date is uncertain. Gonzalez de Najera did not succeed in getting his book Desengaño y reparo de la Guerra del Reino de Chile, published. Although he finished writing it in 1614, it never was published while he was still alive, being printed more than two centuries later in Madrid, in 1866, containing his arguments and proposals and in 1889 in Chile, with a biographical introduction by Jose Toribio Medina.

After its construction, the kurgan had been used for 48 additional burials of different types and at various depths. None of the bodies appeared to have been incinerated; some had been carelessly buried without any grave goods, while others had received wooden coffins or had at least been put on planks before the inhumation, while some had been inserted into stone coffins made of flat slabs of stone. On June 9, 1905, von Stern's crew discovered a lidless stone coffin in the eastern part of the kurgan containing a skeleton whose skull was resting on the runestone. The runestone was discovered by von Stern just as a worker intended to throw it on a pile of stone. The runestone was probably not discovered in its original location, and it is likely that it was originally located at one of the minor barrows in the vicinity.Braun & Arne 1914:45 Inscription The inscription is completely preserved, which is shown by the fact that the first and last letters are marked as the end parts of the inscription. The engravings are c. 8 cm long and 0.75 cm deep. Latin transliteration: : krani : kerþi : (h)alf : þisi : iftir : kal : fi:laka : si(n) Old Norse transcription: : Grani gærði hvalf þessi æftiʀ Karl, felaga sinn. English translation: : \\"Grani made this vault in memory of Karl, his partner.\\"Entry X UaFv1914;47 in Rundata 2.0 Identity It is difficult to determine from where Grani and Karl came. In runic inscriptions, the Old Norse word hvalf (\\"vault\\", \\"coffin\\") only appears in Gotland, and in some late inscriptions from Västergötland (both being regions in present-day Sweden). There are no special traits in the inscription that suggests that it was written in the Old Gutnish dialect of Old Norse, but the shape of the runestone and its placement are usually found on Gotland.Braun & Arne 1914:48 It is likely that the Gotlanders Grani and Karl were on their way to, or from, Constantinople but that Karl died and so Grani prepared his last resting place on an island that had always been visited by sailors, and which the Byzantines called the \\"island of Saint Etherius.\\" The runestone's description of Karl as the félag of Grani indicates that they were operating in a mercantile partnership, but it has been suggested that it could have referred to them as members of the same retinue.Duczko 2004:252 Uniqueness Few runic inscriptions have been discovered in Eastern Europe because stone material was scarce. It may also have been due to the tradition of inscribing runes on wooden poles that were erected on the barrows, something which was described by Ibn Fadlan who met Scandinavians on the shores of the Volga.Pritsak 1987:306 By the time the raising of runestones became fashionable in the 11th century, most Scandinavian settlers in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine had been assimilated by the Slavic majority, and the influx of new settlers had ceased.

Early life and education Born in Olmütz (Olomouc), Moravia, Krobatin entered the Austro-Hungarian Army as a cadet in 1861 and moved on to attend the Artillery Academy in 1865, from which he graduated in 1869 as a Leutnant. He undertook the upper course of artillery from 1871 to 1873, at the end of which he entered service in the Military Committee with the rank of Oberleutnant. Between 1874 and 1876 he studied and attended lectures on chemistry and chemical engineering at the Technical University of Vienna, becoming head of the chemistry laboratory at the Military Technical Committee in 1877. He served as a chemistry and chemical engineering instructor at the Imperial and Royal Technical Military Academy from 1877 to 1882 and recognized as an expert in munitions, he was appointed to the War Ministry in 1896 where he successful worked as a head of department and as chief of a section while also promoted to the rank of Major General in 1900.  Imperial War Minister  Krobatin during the First World War A close associate of the army chief of staff Conrad von Hötzendorf, Krobatin was appointed Imperial Minister for War on 12 December 1912 and as an integral member of the \\"war party\\" gave his full backing to the hawkish element in the military in their calls for an immediate attack on Serbia following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and the July Ultimatum. With the outbreak of war, Krobatin was responsible for the task of harnessing the economies of industrial Austria and agrarian Hungary to ensure the now mobilised military was supplied with vital arms and munitions as well as increasing industrial efficiency to meet the needs of a state with a large cohort of its industrial population no longer available for industrial and food production given their enlistment for war.Pope, S. & Wheal, E.A. (1995): The Macmillan Dictionary of the First World War Macmillan: London. According to a number of sources, Krobatin struggled in his task for the first two years of the war, and although he never really threatened to harness the economy efficiently, he succeeded in tripling the level of artillery available at divisional level. One of the first commanders to be raised to the newly created rank of Generaloberst in February 1916, Krobatin was responsible for dealing with the crisis caused by Romania's entry into the war on the side of the Entente and the sudden cutting off of resources (particularly grain and petroleum) that Romania's declaration of war brought. In Crown council on September 9, 1916, Krobatin sought backing for a proposal which would have allowed the army unrestricted powers to seize foodstuffs and punish hoarders, but this was vetoed by Chancellor Karl Stürgkh and Premier Istvan Tisza. Though occupied Serbia was eventually to produce more grain than Romania, food supplies to soldiers in the field remained a persistent and crucial worry to those at the higher echelons of the War Ministry.  Field Commander  With Conrad's dismissal in March 1917, Krobatin was left isolated in the Crown Council and he was relieved of his tenure over the war ministry in April to be handed command of the Tenth army. It was as a field commander that Krobatin was most successful. Following his role at the Battle of Caporetto in October 1917, during which his force captured two Italian divisions, he was promoted to Field Marshal on November 5, 1917. Redeployed to form part of Archduke Josef's strike force in Tyrol, Krobatin was given command of the entire Tyrol sector following the failure of the Piave Offensive and the Archduke's flight from the front in the face of mutinies on October 26, 1918.  Retirement  Following the rejection of his offer of an armistice to the Italians on October 31, the battered remains of his armies were overrun at Vittorio Veneto a few days latter. Krobatin retired immediately after the close of the war and was never again to hold a commission. He was an Honorary Doctor of Technical Science at the Vienna Technical Institute, Honorary President of the Kaiser Karl War Welfare Fund, and an honorary member of the \\"Viribus Unitis\\" Vienna Riding Association. Krobatin died in Vienna in 1933.

Example of the type of jewellery received by women in exchange for gold used to support the Napoleonic Wars. From the Birmingham Museum of Art. History Prior to production beginning in Berlin very similar jewellery was being produced in Gliwice and France. The roots of Berlin iron jewellery in Berlin can be traced back to the establishment of the Königliche Eisengiesserei bei Berlin or Royal Berlin Foundry in 1804. The Royal Berlin Foundry started with the production of iron goods such as vases, knife stands, candelabra, bowls, plaques and medallions, as well as more commercial articles such as fences, bridges and garden furniture. The first jewellery items, such as long chains with cast links, were produced in 1806. Later, necklaces consisting of medallions and joined with links and wirework mesh were manufactured. When Napoleon took Berlin in 1806 the moulds appear to have been taken back to France where further production took place for some years. The production of iron jewellery reached its peak between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal family urged all citizens to contribute their gold and silver jewellery towards funding the uprising against Napoleon during the War of Liberation. In return the people were given iron jewellery such as brooches and finger rings, often with the inscription Gold gab ich für Eisen (I gave gold for iron), or Für das Wohl des Vaterlands (For the welfare of our country / fatherland), or with a portrait of Frederick William III of Prussia on the back. Until then iron jewellery had only been worn as a symbol of mourning (because of its black colour acquired by treating the castings with linseed cakes) and was worth too little to be alluring, but suddenly it became a symbol of patriotism and loyalty and with its obvious aesthetic appeal, became popular overnight. The numbers of pieces produced started declining after 1850, but still continued to be manufactured until the end of the century when the fashion ended. Around the start of the decline or just before there appears to have been a shift towards designing the jewellery in a more gothic style. It is not widely known, but in 1916 another, similar attempt was made in Germany to promote iron jewellery and to fund the German share in the First World War. This was done by exchanging gold jewellery for an iron medallion inscribed with the words: Gold gab ich zur Wehr, Eisen nahm ich zur Ehr (I give gold towards our defence effort and I take iron for honour). This attempt, however, was not as successful. Today, Berlin iron jewellery are collector's items and true pieces are usually found in museums or private collections. Replicas are widely manufactured today and are easy to obtain especially over the internet. Collections of Berlin iron jewellery are held by among others Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, Neues Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Styles Cast-iron necklace. Held at the Birmingham Museum of Art. At first the style of the designs, especially during the Napoleonic period, was Neo-Classical, incorporating plenty of fretwork and moulded replicas of cameos. From 1810 the style changed slightly to a miniature form of Gothic Revival, incorporating the pointed arch and rose widow of the Gothic cathedral, combined with less austere, more naturalistic motifs such as butterflies, trefoils (a plant with three leaflets such as clover) and vine leaves. The jewellery has a very fine, detailed and lacy appearance. Berlin iron jewellery was lacquered black to prevent the iron from rusting and to enhance its purpose as mourning jewellery. Only a few rare examples were decorated with fine gold, silver settings or polished steel. Some were also set with medallions, imitating the Greek classical scenes on some of the jasperware made by the famous potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730–1795), or the portrait medallions of contemporaries made by James Tassie (1735–1799). Between 1808 and 1848 the Royal Berlin Factory marketed plaques as new year gifts. Known as Neujahr-plaketten (new year reliefs) they generally featured some event relevant to the year in question. Manufacturing For such intricate detail and thin-sectioned castings to be produced as were done with Berlin iron jewellery, a very pure iron which contained up to 0.7% phosphorus was used. This was done to make the iron slightly more fluid than what it would be when normally molten. Although this type of phosphoric cast iron is rather hard and brittle, strength is not the main purpose of the metal when it is used in jewellery. The molten iron was cast into metal chill moulds.

It is situated northeast of Crescent Lake and south of Odell Lake on Oregon Route 58, and is next to Crescent Lake State Airport. The zip code 97733, which includes Crescent Lake Junction, had a total population of 122 people in the year 2000.\\\\- Fact Sheet - America FactFinder \\"America FactFinder 1 June 2008. U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved 1 June 2008. History The community was originally located along the Southern Pacific Railroad line, south by southwest of its current site, and was known as Crescent Lake, Oregon. The former site was built after the completion of a section of railroad in 1923 (opened in 1926) called the Natron Cutoff, in the Cascade Range. This section superseded the route through the Siskiyou Mountains for trains traveling between the Willamette Valley and California. The community of Crescent Lake was built to service the steam trains that operated on the line until the 1950s and to maintain the track and signals over the adjacent section of the main line. Crescent Lake also served as a division meeting point where the operation of freight trains passed to fresh crews. Trains bound from Oregon to California were manned by crews from Eugene in the Willamette Valley up the \\"Hill\\" to Crescent Lake, where crews from Klamath Falls relieved them for the continuation of travel to Dunsmuir in northern California. Crews operating trains in the opposite direction were similarly relieved at Crescent Lake. Each of the relieved crews remained at Crescent Lake for a mandatory rest period, after which they relieved an arriving crew and returned to their respective home location. The site included a train depot, a roundhouse, a lodging facility for resting train crews which was known as the \\"Clubhouse\\", two general stores (one containing a tavern), a restaurant, a one-room schoolhouse, and a post office. The local railroad staff included a complete section gang (right-of-way maintainers), a signal maintainer, an electrician, a station agent and shift operators, a trainmaster, a yardmaster, and several other tradesmen. After World War II, the community began moving to its present site along Oregon Route 58, which had been completed a few years earlier in 1940. In 1958, the roundhouse was decommissioned and soon torn down, and in 1970 a fire in the restaurant destroyed the remaining businesses on what is now known as Crescent Lake Hwy.Hall, Fred R., and Mabel Park Hall, \\"Crescent Lake, Steam to Diesel, 1934-45\\"Oregon Historical Quarterly.

Garcia spent 23 years with the Houston Police Department, before becoming a city councilman. Garcia served six years as a Houston City Councilman, eventually becoming Mayor Pro-Tempore under former Mayor Bill White. In 2008 he became Sheriff of Harris County. In 2015 Garcia stepped down from post as Sheriff to run for Mayor of the City of Houston. Garcia won the general election to be Commissioner of Precinct 2 for Harris County on November 6, 2018, after advancing from the primary on March 6, 2018.  Early life  Garcia was born in Houston, Texas to his parents Maria and Ignacio Garcia, as the youngest of six children. His parents immigrated to the US after his father received a guest-worker visa before his birth, after which he petitioned to be re-admitted to the US under a work visa. In his youth, Adrian Garcia helped his parents’ automotive shop fixing cars.  Law enforcement career  Garcia became a member of the Houston Police Department in 1980, and remained a member for 23 years. In 1994, he was appointed the first Houston Police Department’s liaison to the Mayor’s Anti-Gang Office. In 1999, he was then promoted to Director of the Anti-Gang Office. He has also served as a consultant for the U.S. State Department on the subject of law enforcement and policing programs in Central America.  Houston City Council  After a campaign that included negative ads distributed by the special interest group Citizens for a Better America, in 2004 Garcia was elected the Houston city councilman for District H. Upon election he was named to the Committee on Public Safety. He also later served as the Chair of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee and Chair of the Minority Women Business Enterprise Committee. He also served as Vice Chair of Fiscal Affairs and the Vice Chair of Drainage and Flooding Committee. Garcia served on the Houston City Council for six years, and from 2007 to 2008 he served as Mayor Pro- Tempore under Houston Mayor Bill White. Over his career, he was involved in issues involving the protection of disability rights. He also testified before the U.S. House of Representatives on subjects including affordable housing and border enforcement. In 2008 Garcia ran for Sheriff, during which he again suffered from negative campaign ads, this time about possible marijuana use during his childhood. Garcia stated in response that he had already admitted to this on his Houston Police Department application, and the ad ended up boosting Garcia’s campaign coffers.  Sheriff of Harris County  After his election he became the first Latino Sheriff of Harris County with about sixty percent of the vote. In 2009, upon becoming Sheriff of Harris County, the third largest sheriff’s county in the United States, one of Garcia’s main focuses was ending the housing of inmates outside of Harris County, specifically out of state. After returning all out of county and out of state inmates to Harris County, Garcia then reprogrammed the recouped revenues to pay for additional guards and expand the use of technology in the county, including apps to connect citizens to the police. Additional programs that Garcia implemented included Mentoring Moms, that provided female inmates that were pregnant or had just given birth parenting mentorship. He also partnered with the district attorney’s office on a pilot program to keep first-offence marijuana users out of prison. Garcia used these and other programs to reduce recidivism and prison overcrowding, using house-arrest as an alternative to incarceration. He also lobbied the legislature to reinstate mental health programs in the county, specifically geared towards crime prevention. Additionally, he worked with the FAA to introduce new helicopters to the county to protect Houston’s waterways. In 2011 a 72-year-old inmate at the Harris County Jail died from complications of a heart attack after suffering physical trauma caused by correctional officers. In response to a public outcry over excessive force, Garcia fired two jailers and one deputy for failing to aid the inmate. He then won reelection in 2012. In 2013, Garcia instituted “an LGBTI policy to protect against discrimination, aid jailers in appropriately housing and classifying inmates by gender, and keep LGBTI inmates safe,” seen as one of the most effective in the US according to the Houston Press. In 2014 Garcia launched a criminal investigation into the conditions at Harris County Jail, and invited the Department of Justice to aide in the investigation, after another inmate was alleged to have been locked in a filth-ridden solitary confinement cell. As late as April 24, 2015, Garcia claimed he knew \\"nothing\\" about Goodwin's condition until after the media got involved after he attacked a prison official. Garcia has stated that he knew nothing about these conditions until after the media got involved. However, one of Garcia's former chief deputies, later claimed that he had previously told Garcia of the abuse to no effect. Local Houston activist Quanell X along with the inmate’s mother called for Garcia's resignation. In response to the incident, Garcia fired six jail officers and disciplined others. Later that year, the bipartisan Congressional Victims’ Rights Caucus awarded Garcia the Suzanne McDaniel Memorial Award for Public Awareness for his work against human trafficking. In February 2015, Garcia allowed his deputy Sheriff to become the first American deputy Sheriff to be allowed to serve wearing the Sikh articles of faith (a turban and beard) as a part of his uniform. Garcia stated that he would have to step down from his position in May 2015 in order to run for the Mayor of Houston, as per Texas law that requires the Sheriff to resign if running for another office. Upon his resignation, the Houston Chronicle wrote that, “commissioners would be doing the citizens of Harris County a disservice if they choose a successor eager to burnish his or her law-and-order, get-tough-on-crime credentials by undoing the progressive reforms Garcia has implemented in the large and unwieldy department he supervises.”  Electoral campaign for Mayor of Houston  Prior to the campaign Garcia stated he supported the establishment of county-wide pre-K education as a method of future crime-prevention in addition to citing his bringing the Sheriff’s department out of a $60 million deficit that existed before his term. He announced his intentions to run for Mayor, following a few months of public speculation on when he would join the race, on May 6, 2015, to replace the prior Mayor who was unable to run due to term limits. In his announcement speech, he claimed to have saved the Sheriff’s department $200 million over his tenure. Following his announcement, a search for his replacement began, with Garcia retaining his position as Sheriff until his replacement could be found and appointed. During a September 2015 debate, Garcia faced questioning by his mayoral opponents regarding the role he played in one of the inmate abuse cases.

Life He was educated at Oakham School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Having taken Anglican orders, he obtained a curacy at Calne, Wiltshire. After some years of the Anglican ministry at Marylebone, Ramsgate, and elsewhere, he became a Catholic in 1846. The rest of his life, the latter years of which were spent at Cheltenham, he devoted to religious literature. Works He published as his defence: *\\"Remarks on certain Anglican Theories of Unity\\" (1846); *\\"The Unity of the Episcopate considered\\" (1847); and *\\"A few earnest thoughts on the Duty of Communion with the Catholic Church\\" (1847). In 1851 jointly with James Spencer Northcote he undertook the editorship of the series of controversial pamphlets known as The Clifton Tracts. His chief works were: *lives of M. Olier (1861), Marie Harpain (1869), St. Stanislaus Kostka (1869), Baron de Rentz (1873), and Henri-Marie Boudon (1881); *\\"Devotion to the Nine Choirs of Holy Angels\\" (1869); *\\"The Life and Glories of St. Joseph\\" (1888); and *\\"Before and After Gunpowder Plot\\" (1890). Most of this work was adaptation of books in other languages. Family The poet Francis Thompson was his nephew. He married Harriet Diana Calvert, daughter of Nicholson Calvert of Humsden, born at Humsden, Hertfordshire, 1811; died at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, 21 Aug., 1896. On her husband's conversion she also joined the Catholic Church, and like him devoted herself to literary work. Her chief work is the \\"Life of Charles Borromeo\\", but she also wrote stories of Catholic life.

He is known for the idea that hadronic matter has a \\"melting point\\". The Hagedorn temperature is named in his honor. Early life Hagedorn's younger life was deeply marked by the upheavals of World War II in Europe. He graduated from high school in 1937 and was drafted into the German Army. After the war began, he was shipped off into North Africa as an officer in the Rommel Afrika Korps. He was captured in 1943, and spent the rest of the war in an officer prison camp in the United States. Most of the prisoners were young and with nothing to do, Hagedorn and others set up their own 'university' where they taught each other whatever they knew. There, Hagedorn ran into an assistant of David Hilbert, who taught him mathematics. Becoming a physicist When Hagedorn came back home in January 1946, most German universities were destroyed. Because of his training in the Crossville, Tennessee prison camp, he was accepted as a fourth-semester student at the University of Göttingen – one of the few remaining universities. After having completed his studies with the usual diploma (1950) and doctorate (1952), with a thesis under Prof. Richhard Becker on thermal solid-state theory, he was accepted as a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Physics (MPI), still at Göttingen at the time. While he was there, he was among a group of physicists including Bruno Zumino, Harry Lehmann, Wolfhart Zimmermann, Kurt Symanzik, Gerhard Lüders, Reinhard Oehme, Vladimir Glaser, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Life at CERN In 1954—following a recommendation from Werner Heisenberg who was director at MPI at the time—Hagedorn took up an appointment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The new laboratory was about to be established. The pioneering work on linear orbit theory had just been completed by Gerhard Lüders, who wished to go back to Göttingen. In the initial years, Hagedorn helped with particle accelerator designs, particularly to calculate non-linear oscillations in particle orbits. When the CERN theory group came to Geneva from Copenhagen in 1957, where it had been located at first, Hagedorn joined the group. Hagedorn brought to the Theory Division an unusual interdisciplinary background which included particle and nuclear as well as thermal, solid state and accelerator physics. Once member of the Theory Division, he exclusively focused on the statistical models of particle production. Particle production work Léon Van Hove and Rolf Hagedorn watching results on a computer terminal at CERN, 1968. Hagedorn's work started when Bruno Ferretti (then-head of the Theory Division), asked him to try to predict particle yields in the high energy collisions of the time. He started with Frans Cerulus. There were few clues to begin with but they made the best of the \\"fireball concept\\" which was then supported by cosmic ray studies and used it to make predictions about particle yields (and therefore the secondary beams to be expected from the main beam directed at a target). As a result of his investigations the self-consistency principle was developed. Many key ingredients brought soon afterward by experiment helped refine the approach. Among them is the limited transverse momentum with which the overwhelming majority of the secondary particles happen to be produced. They show an exponential drop with respect to the transverse mass. There is also the exponential drop of elastic scattering at wide angles as a function of incident energy. Such exponential behaviors strongly suggested a thermal distribution for whatever eventually comes out of the reaction. Based on this, Hagedorn put forth his thermal interpretation and used it to build production models which turned out to be remarkably accurate at predicting yields for the many different types of secondary particles. Many objections were raised at the time, particularly as to what could actually be 'thermalized' in the collisions, applying straightforward statistical mechanics to the produced pions gave the wrong results, and the temperature of the system was apparently constant when it should have risen with the incident energy or with the mass of the excited fireball (according to Boltzmann's Law). For collision energies above approximately 10 GeV, the naive statistical model needed improvement.  Hagedorn temperature and the statistical bootstrap model (SBM)  Seeing the experimental results, Hagedorn invented a new theoretical framework called statistical bootstrap model (SBM). The SBM model of strong interactions is based on the observation that hadrons are made of hadrons in an infinite chain. This leads to the concept of a sequence of heavier and heavier particles, each being a possible constituent of a still heavier one, while at the same time being itself composed of lighter particles. In this SBM framework there would be ever increasing particle production at the Hagedorn temperature. Hagedorn gave this extensive summary of the historical path across 50 years of research in particle physics at his last 2-hours public lecture in Divonne 1994, which was recorded and later made available online. Hagedorn interpreted this limiting temperature, visible at that time also in the transverse mass distribution of the secondary particles, in terms of the slope of an exponential spectrum of all strongly interacting particles appearing in the SBM; the value is of the order of ~150-160 MeV. Later work allowed the interpretation of the Hagedorn temperature as the temperature at which hadrons melt into a new phase of matter, the quark-gluon plasma. Awards and legacy An honorary book (or festschrift) was written by professor Johann Rafelski in 2016 as a tribute to Hagedorn. The book includes contributions by contemporaneous friends and colleagues of Hagedorn: Tamás Biró, Igor Dremin, Torleif Ericson, Marek Gaździcki, Mark Gorenstein, Hans Gutbrod, Maurice Jacob, István Montvay, Berndt Müller, Grazyna Odyniec, Emanuele Quercigh, Krzysztof Redlich, Helmut Satz, Luigi Sertorio, Ludwik Turko, and Gabriele Veneziano.

Early life Peppin was born around 1841, and later moved to California. He joined the Union Army as a part of the 5th Infantry California Volunteers in 1861. He served with them until the end of the Civil War, mustering out in Mesilla, New Mexico having seen little to no combat action. He began working as a mason, and built many of the houses and structures of Lincoln, New Mexico. Murphy-Dolan association Some time around 1874 Peppin became associated with James Dolan, a partner to Lawrence Murphy in a local mercantile and banking operation. By 1876, rancher and businessman John Tunstall had partnered with Alexander McSween to form a rival business, which developed into tensions between the Murphy-Dolan and Tunstall-McSween factions. By this time, Peppin was working as a Deputy Sheriff for Sheriff William J. Brady. The Sheriff's Office sided with the Murphy-Dolan faction, who soon after hired the Jessie Evans Gang and the John Kinney Gang as gunmen to harass the competition through cattle rustling. Tunstall hired Billy the Kid, Dick Brewer, Charlie Bowdre, Frank Coe, George Coe, Doc Scurlock and John Middleton to counter the hired guns employed by Murphy-Dolan. Lincoln County War On February 18, 1878, members of the Jesse Evans Gang shot and killed John Tunstall, which sparked the Lincoln County War. The Lincoln County Regulators, led by Dick Brewer, were formed to bring to justice those involved in the Tunstall murder, and several were killed over the following months, to include the Regulator leader Dick Brewer, and with Buckshot Roberts, William Morton and Frank Baker being killed by the Regulators, and later Sheriff Brady himself along with Deputy George W. Hindman. Peppin was present during the Sheriff Brady shootout, but was not wounded. Following Brady's death, John Copeland was appointed to the office of sheriff, but was dismissed shortly thereafter due to his refusing to take the side of the Murphy-Dolan faction, and he was replaced by Peppin, whose loyalties were with Murphy-Dolan, and with his weak demeanor he was easily influenced by that faction. Peppin deputized members of the Murphy-Dolan faction, to include Evans, a main suspect in the Tunstall murder. He then led a campaign against the Regulators, resulting in the death of Regulator Frank McNabb and with Regulator Ab Saunders being seriously wounded during the gunfight at the Fritz Ranch. Peppin then led a posse into Lincoln on July 15, 1878, to clash with the rest of the Regulators, assembled by Alex McSween. In what would become known as the Battle of Lincoln, Peppin and his posse well outnumbered the besieged Regulators, and received assistance from the US Cavalry under the command of Colonel Nathan Dudley. That battle ended in a draw. McSween and his business partner Harvey Morris, along with Regulator Tom Cullin were killed, as were Peppin's men, \\"Dutch Charlie\\" Kruling, Bob Beckwith, and Charlie Crawford. Other Regulators escaped, and although the tensions continued for some time afterward, for all practical purposes the Lincoln County War ended there. Aftermath Peppin lived in fear following the range wars end, resigning as sheriff immediately afterward, and begging for sanctuary at Fort Stanton, where for a time he worked as a butcher. He also worked as a butcher for rancher Pat Coghlan for a time during this period, before returning to work as a mason. He testified in the court of inquiry on behalf of Colonel Nathan Dudley, and later testified against Billy the Kid in the killing of Sheriff Brady. Peppin lived out the remainder of his life in solitude, dying in 1904.

The event is organized by the Adana Metropolitan Municipality and takes place in June. Beginning from 2006, the scope of the festival is broadened to an international dimension within the framework of the cinema in Mediterranean basin countries. The festival, taking its name from cotton boll, the traditional crop grown in the region, includes national feature films along with international short subjects (since 2006) and student films of young Mediterranean filmmakers (from 2008 on). The 15th edition of the festival was held between June 2–8, 2008.  History  The Altın Koza Film Festival was organized for the first time in 1969 jointly by the Adana Cinema Club, Adana Municipality and the State Films Archives under the simple name \\"Film Festival\\". The event recurred until 1973 uninterrupted. However, in 1974 it came to an end, discontinuing 18 years long. In 1992, the festival was revived with its 6th edition and was held until 1997 under the name \\"Altın Koza Culture, Arts and Film Festival\\". Due to earthquakes occurred in 1998 and 1999, and later because of economical reasons, the festival could not be continued for seven successive years. In 2005, the Altın Koza Festival resumed with its 12th edition.

The Conservative Party reinforced its hold on County Hall and only the loss of 2 seats in Dacorum Borough detracted from a strong showing across the County. It maintained a stranglehold on the Eastern part of the County, winning all of the seats in Broxbourne District and East Herts District. The Liberal Democrats made a strong showing in Watford and St Albans District and made gains in Tring Division (Dacorum) and Chells Division (Stevenage) from Conservatives and Labour respectively. The Labour Party were the main losers on the day, with a net loss of 11 seats and being beaten into third place in the popular vote. The Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrat Party were the main benefactors from Labour's poor performance, gaining 6 seats and 4 seats respectively. The Greens gained a single seat in Watford District (Callowland Leggatts), again at Labour's expense. Labour would find little consolation from this election suffering significant losses throughout the central and western parts of the County.

The story is told from three points of view: Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots; Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury, also known as Bess of Hardwick; and George Talbot, the 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. According to Gregory, \\"The Other Queen has been a wonderful book to research and write – I have quite transformed my view of Mary Queen of Scots and to research Bess of Hardwick, her rival and gaoler, has been enormously interesting.\\"  Plot  Mary Stuart, cousin to Queen Elizabeth, has fled to England after she has lost the support of the Scots after marrying Bothwell, whom the people believe murdered her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. She has left her son in Scotland in the hands of the Protestants and expects her cousin to restore her to her throne. Secretly, however, Mary recognizes herself as Queen of Scotland (since she was born to it), France (since she married to it), and England (since Elizabeth's paternity and her mother's marriage to her father is questionable). As Mary plots to overthrow Elizabeth, Elizabeth puts her in the custody of George Talbot and his wife, Bess of Hardwicke, in response to Mary's repeated attempts to claim the English throne. Mary is indignant at the captivity, repeatedly stating her royal status, and is upset when she is given some of the reigning queen's gowns to wear, saying that they are \\"hand-me- downs.\\" She is unafraid of punishment for any reckless or insulting behavior she makes to her cousin, believing that one would never execute a fellow monarch. Most of the novel centers around the first few years of Mary's Stuart's imprisonment, during which time she makes several failed escape attempts and almost immediately begins to seduce the earl. George slowly begins to feel his loyalty to Elizabeth fade, replaced by a strong attachment to the captive queen. This results in marital problems with Bess, who ultimately separates from him. The last chapter takes place fifteen years after the previous one. It is narrated by Bess, who reveals that Mary has recently been executed for participating in a plot to steal the throne of England. George watched the beheading in tears and was bankrupt from the years of expense to house her. Bess ends the book saying that she is well off, wealthy and prosperous, and that her granddaughter Arbella is an heir to the English throne. (However, this claim was not acknowledged, and Mary's son James I was crowned after Elizabeth's death in 1603.)

Their style of dance is British Bhangra and they frequently base their performances around Michael Jackson songs, such as \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Thriller\\". They gained wide recognition during their performances in the second series of Britain's Got Talent, in which they were runners-up to the winner street dancer George Sampson. Early years Suleman Mirza is a trainee solicitor/lawyer His involvement concerns the Michael Jackson tribute moves of the dance. Madhu Singh works at PC World in Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport. Singh's main involvement is entering part-way through the act and performing Bhangra dance. Mirza, a British Muslim of Pakistani descent, and Singh, a British Sikh of Indian descent, met when they were both auditioning separately for a student talent contest in 2000 at the University of Westminster. Being from the same part of South Asia, Punjab (a region that was carved into modern Pakistan and India during the Partition of 1947), a place well known for its dance and music, they were both interested in performing together. At the time, Mirza was a full-time economics and business student at the University of Westminster. This led to the formation of their dance group, Signature, in 2001. Since then, they performed their acts in various British Asian and Bollywood-themed shows, sometimes alongside several Bollywood movie stars. In addition, Mirza has worked with Chris Brown, Leona Lewis, McFly, Dannii Minogue, Jay Sean, Alexandra Burke, Sugababes, and choreographer Lavelle Smith Junior (who has choreographed for Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Beyoncé Knowles). In 2006, Mirza performed for Michael Jackson at the televised World Music Awards 2006 held at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, where he had met Jackson in person. Singh, meanwhile, has hosted television shows on the Zee Music channel, and had also appeared on the music video for Jay Sean's \\"Eyes on You\\" in 2004. Britain's Got Talent Audition On Britain's Got Talent in their audition in London, which aired on 24 April 2008, Signature performed to \\"Nachna Onda Nei\\" by Tigerstyle featuring Kaka Bhaniawala—a bhangra tune mixed to the beat of Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\". They combined the Michael Jackson lyrics and style of dancing with traditional bhangra style music and dancing in a comedy dance act. Before the audition, Mirza said: \\"I don't think the judges will have ever seen an act like mine before...in this act there will be a lot of moon walking, but there is a twist, and if they weren't Michael Jackson fans before they may even turn into one.\\" Mirza is then shown moonwalking around the stage, and performing Michael Jackson style dance moves. As he dances, Madhu Singh, dressed in a white coat, walks past the show presenters Ant & Dec at the side of the stage and makes his way onto the stage with a broom. The two then start a Bhangra/Michael Jackson \\"dance off\\", bringing with it a standing ovation from the audience and one of the judges, Amanda Holden. Semi-final In the first semi-final on 26 May they performed to \\"Thriller\\", winning the public vote and so went through to the final. Final Before the final show, Simon Cowell said that he believed that Signature were one of five acts who could win the show. In the final they again performed to \\"Nachna Onda Nei\\" and finished in the top three alongside street dancer, George Sampson and boy soprano, Andrew Johnston. Sampson won the show with Signature finishing as runners-up. After Britain's Got Talent Suleman Mirza (2009) Following the end of the second series of Britain's Got Talent, Signature were given the \\"official stamp of approval by Michael Jackson himself\\", while members of the Jackson family have become their fans and got in touch with Signature soon after the show ended.

It is the largest producer of traditional method sparkling wine worldwideThe Oxford Companion to Wine, Fourth Edition, entry for Freixenet, and the largest exporter of Cava. The company was founded in 1861 and now belongs to Henkell & Co. Sektkellerei. History Freixenet was started after the union of two Spanish families with a lengthy history in winemaking: the Ferrers, owners of La Freixeneda, a 12th-century farming estate in Sant Quintí de Mediona in the Alt Penedès, and the Salas, winemakers since 1830 and the founders of Casa Sala, a wine exporter to Latin America, in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia.History on the company's website, retrieved 18 March 2018 Towards the end of the 19th century, Dolores Sala Vivé, the granddaughter of the founder of Casa Sala, married Pedro Ferrer Bosch of La Freixeneda. This era saw the gradual loss of Spain’s colonies and grape production diminishing due to the phylloxera plague that had destroyed red grape vines across Europe. Inspired by the success of Champagne, Codorníu and others encouraged vineyard owners to replant with white grape varieties like Macabeu, Parellada and Xarel·lo to use for sparkling wine production. These grapes are still the primary grapes of Cava today though some producers are experimenting with the use of the Champagne wine grapes of Chardonnay and Pinot noir. As a result, the newlyweds joined forces with Dolores' father to switch the focus of the Sala family business to sparkling wines made under the traditional method, or méthode Champenoise. The name comes from La Freixenada – a family wine producing estate located in the Alt Penedès region since the 13th Century. In 1941, Freixenet launched its leading product, the Carta Nevada. In 1974, the company achieved international success with another cava, the Cordon Negro. Nowadays Freixenet offers public tours of the winery in which both cavas are produced; visitors are shown the underground cellars and the bottling plant before tasting the finished product. The winery is situated opposite the main train station in the Catalan village of Sant Sadurní d'Anoia. Around 95% of Spain's total Cava production is from Catalonia and Sant Sadurní d'Anoia is home to many of Spain's largest production houses.Oxford pg 144-145 Freixenet purchased the Australian Wingara Wine Group in 2008. Wingara owns Katnook Estate in Coonawarra and Deakin Estate in the Murray Darling region near Mildura. In August 2018, Henkell & Co. Sektkellerei (daughter company of Dr. Oetker) took control of Freixenet after acquiring 50.67% of the shares.  Marketing  This Cava company taps into a world-famous celebrity to be the face of its much-awaited Christmas TV commercial. Celebrities who have appeared in Freixenet's Christmas sparkling wine include Liza Minnelli (1977), Raquel Welch (1985), Paul Newman (1989), Antonio Banderas and Sharon Stone (1992), Kim Basinger (1993), Penélope Cruz (1994 and 2001), Alejandro Sanz (1998), Pierce Brosnan (2004), Demi Moore (2005) and Shakira (2010). After this year, the Cava producer shifted its advertising direction and became one of the first companies to explore influencer marketing by selecting Catalan artist Diana Lado to become their first official brand ambassador. This became a successful format that other companies followed. Freixenet is the main sponsor of the roller hockey (quad) team, Club Esportiu Noia, that usually competes in the main Spanish league and also European Competitions:CERH European League and CERS Cup. Due to this sponsorship agreement the name of the team is CE NOIA Freixenet. Freixenet is also the official cava of the MotoGP World Championship since 2003.

Taunton was educated at Downside, and formed a desire to enter the Benedictine Order, but health was an obstacle. He studied music at Lichfield and became an accomplished organist. He the entered the Institute of St. Andrew, founded by the Catholic convert, George Bampfield, at Barnet; but again his health prevented him from remaining.

She is Professor of English and Related Literature at the University of St Andrews, and co-General Editor of the Cambridge University Press edition of the writings of Virginia Woolf. Sellers' first novel, Vanessa and Virginia, is a fictionalised account of the life of Vanessa Bell and of her complex relationship with her sister. Sellers' second novel, Given the Choice, is set in the contemporary art and music worlds. Life Sellers gained her PhD from the University of London in 1992, having previously received a Diplôme d'Etudes Approfondies from the University of Paris (Sorbonne). While in Paris, Sellers became involved with leading French feminist writers, and has written on their work, for example, Language and Sexual Difference (Macmillan, 1995).http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=253589 She has worked closely with Hélène Cixous, and has been influential in introducing her work to the English-speaking world, in books such as The Hélène Cixous Reader (Routledge, 1994), Hélène Cixous: Authorship, Autobiography and Love (Polity and Blackwell, 1996),http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=0745612555 \\"Hélène Cixous: Live Theory (with Ian Blyth, Continuum, 2004), and in translations such Three Steps on the Ladder of Writing (with Sarah Cornell, Columbia University Press, 1993) and Coming to Writing and Other Essays (with Sarah Cornell, Deborah Jenson and Ann Liddle, Harvard University Press, 1991). Sellers' work has been oriented towards women's writing. Myth and Fairy Tale in Contemporary Women's Fiction (Palgrave, 2001)http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=252822 is an investigation into the ongoing resonance of myth and fairy tale for contemporary women's fiction, drawing on material by Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Bruno Bettelheim, Roland Barthes, Jack Zipes and Marina Warner, as well as French feminists Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, to read works by such writers as A. S. Byatt, Angela Carter, Anne Rice, Michèle Roberts, Emma Tennant and Fay Weldon. Sellers has also written on and edited a number of collections concerned with feminist theory and criticism, including A History of Feminist Literary Criticism (with Gill Plain, Cambridge University Press, 2007) and Feminist Criticism: Theory and Practice (Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1991). Sellers' interest in the writings of Virginia Woolf has led to her involvement in the Cambridge University Press edition of Woolf's writings, which she co-directs with Jane Goldman. Goldman and Sellers received an Arts and Humanities Research Council Award in 2005 for this project. The edition aims for transparency in its mapping of the variants between the first British edition of Woolf's texts and those she subsequently oversaw – in particular the first American publication. It also aims to provide full annotation to Woolf's densely allusive prose. In addition to co-directing the project, Sellers also co-edited Virginia Woolf's The Waves (with Michael Herbert). With Sue Roe, Sellers co-edited and contributed to The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf (Cambridge University Press, 2000). Sellers edited the second edition of The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf in 2010. Sellers' novel, Vanessa and Virginia, is in part a fictional biography of Virginia Woolf. It has also been translated into 16 languages, including Chinese, Spanish, French, Swedish and Dutch, and was adapted for the stage by Elizabeth Wright and directed by Gersch in 2009. The play premiered in Aix-en- Provence in 2010. Throughout, Sellers has been particularly interested in the creative process of writing. This is reflected in three collections published by The Women's Press – Delighting the Heart: A Notebook by Women Writers (1988), Taking Reality by Surprise (1991), and Instead of Full Stops (1996) – as well as in the translated selections from The Writing Notebooks of Hélène Cixous ( Continuum, 2004). For this latter project, Sellers was awarded a Leverhulme Research Fellowship in 2001–2002, which she held as a Visiting Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Sellers now combines her academic research with work as a novelist. In 2002 she won the Canongate Prize for short story writing and in 2007 received a New Writing Partnership Arts Council award for her novel Vanessa and Virginia. She is a senior member of St Catharine's College, Cambridge.

Life  His father was Franz Seraph Streber. He entered the Ludwigsgymnasium in 1850, but a nervous fever prevented him from qualifying for the university through the usual final school examination. From this ailment he never completely recovered. Entering the university by a private examination in 1858, he devoted over two years to the study of philosophy and theology, attending besides historical lectures. During this period he compiled a description and catalogue of the ancient coins in the Royal Cabinet of Medals. In 1861 he entered the archiepiscopal seminary at Freising, and in 1864 was ordained priest. After the death of his father he was unable to pursue his original intention of studying numismatics. In 1867 he was appointed religious teacher at the Wilhelmsgymnasium. Having received six months' leave of absence in 1868, he won the doctorate in theology in Rome (January, 1869). He then resumed his duties as religious teacher until June, 1870, when he was dismissed for alleged \\"intriguing in favour of the dogma of infallibility\\". He was then named pastor of Wolfersdorf, near Freising. Invited by Joseph Hergenröther to assist him in editing the new edition of the Kirchenlexikon, Streber resigned his parish, and settled in Würzburg. When Hergenröther was summoned as cardinal to Rome, Streber moved to Bonn to be near Kaulen, the new editor, and worked on the \\"Nomenclator\\". He wrote many articles for the Kirchenlexikon, the direction of which was for a time entirely in his hands. In 1892 illness forced him to withdraw to his brother's house at Tölz, where he lived in retirement until death. References ;Attribution * The entry cites: **Buchberger, Kirchlich.

Description The title of Gavin Douglas' translation \\"Eneados\\" is given in the heading of a manuscript at Cambridge University, which refers to the \\"twelf bukis of Eneados.\\" The title of the first printed edition London (1553) was The xiii Bukes of Eneados of the famose Poete Virgill.The 1553 titlepage illustrates the cover of Kendal (2011) The work was the first complete translation of any major work of classical antiquity into an English or Anglic language. In addition to Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the work also contains a translation of the \\"thirteenth book\\" written by the fifteenth-century poet Maffeo Vegio as a continuation of the Aeneid. Douglas supplied original prologue verses for each of the thirteen books, and a series of concluding poems. There is also an incomplete commentary, covering only part of the first book, written as marginal notes (almost certainly in Douglas's own hand) in the Cambridge manuscript. In the first general prologue Douglas compares the merits of Virgil and Chaucer as master poets and attacks the printer William Caxton for his inadequate rendering of a French translation of the Aeneid. Critical reception Douglas's reputation among modern readers was bolstered somewhat in 1934 when Ezra Pound included several passages of the Eneados in his ABC of Reading. Comparing Douglas to Chaucer, Pound wrote that \\"the texture of Gavin's verse is stronger, the resilience greater than Chaucer's\\".Ezra Pound, ABC of Reading (London: Routledge, 1934; repr. New York: New Directions, 1960), p. 115. C. S. Lewis was also an admirer of the work: \\"About Douglas as a translator there may be two opinions; about his Aeneid (Prologues and all) as an English book there can be only one. Here a great story is greatly told and set off with original embellishments which are all good—all either delightful or interesting—in their diverse ways.\\"C. S. Lewis, English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama, Oxford History of English Literature (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1954), p. 90. Sample Douglas translates the opening of the poem thus: Manuscripts and editions The principal early manuscripts of the Eneados are * Cambridge MS (c. 1525), in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge * Elphynstoun MS (before 1527), in the library of the University of Edinburgh * Ruthven MS (c. 1535), also in the library of the University of Edinburgh * Lambeth MS (1545–1546), in the library of Lambeth Palace. The poem was copied into this manuscript by Thomas Bellenden.Van Heijnsberg, in The Renaissance in Scotland, Brill (1984), p.195 * Bath (or Longleat) MS (1547), in the Marquess of Bath's library at Longleat The first printed edition appeared in London in 1553, from the press of William Copland. It displays an anti–Roman Catholic bias, in that references (in the prologues) to the Virgin Mary, Purgatory, and Catholic ceremonies are altered or omitted; in addition, 66 lines of the translation, describing the amour of Dido and Aeneas, are omitted as indelicate. The 1710 Edinburgh folio edited by Thomas Ruddiman, which includes a full glossary and a biography of Douglas by Bishop John Sage, is based on the 1553 edition and the Ruthven manuscript, perhaps with corrections from the Bath manuscript. The Bannatyne Club edition of 1839 is a printing of the Cambridge manuscript.The information about manuscripts and early editions is derived from John Small, The Poetical Works of Gavin Douglas (Edinburgh: William Patterson, 1874), vol. 1, pp. clxxii–clxxxii. Small's own edition in that work is based on the Elphynstoun manuscript. The standard modern edition of the Eneados is the four-volume Scottish Text Society edition by David F. C. Coldwell.David F.

It is one of the main business streets in the city and always carries heavy traffic. Earlier, the road to the south of Overbridge Junction, till East Fort Junction, also was a part of MG Road, but was later renamed, after widening to 6-lane, to Swatantra Sarani (or Free Way), though it is still known by its former name. The road continues further southwards as Kovalam Road.  Landmarks  The F=fort can still be seen to the west, and is a bustling business area. Its southern extremes constitute the main wholesale business district of Trivandrum, namely Chalai Bazaar. To the west is the famous Padmanabha Swamy Temple, inside the fort, the nucleus around which Trivandrum evolved in the 18th century. The city bus stand is also located near here. The second entry of Trivandrum Central Railway Station also opens, through Power House Road, to MG Road at Pazhavangady, which is also famous for its Ganesha temple. Important landmarks of the city like the Secretariat, housing various government offices, University College and Pazhavangadi temple are located on this 2 km stretch.  Development works  North of Overbridge Junction, the road is in various stages of being widened to six lanes, a part of the Capital Road Improvement Project. The project was expected to complete in a year. Being the capital, the road is often blocked by various protest marches. The entire city often used to face this difficulty as MG Road was the main arterial road. To overcome this problem, an underpass from Senate Hall Circle now runs below the Martyrs' Square and ends to the east of Palayam, to the north of Connemara Market, on the main road to the Railway Station. A flyover is planned from Thakarapparambu across MG Road to Powerhouse Road as well.  Public transit  Many buses servicing the city and its suburbs run through MG Road.

A highly regarded teacher and mentor to many prominent Australian musicians, such as Don Burrows, Larry Sitsky and Roger Woodward, Hanson himself was largely self-taught. As a composer, Hanson was not a follower of prevailing trends, and consequently his music was unfashionable and ignored by many other composers. Late in life however, his distinctive personal style began to receive greater recognition, and since his death his work has been held in high esteem by some critics.Review: The Centre for Studies in Australian Music, Number 20, October 2005. See Sitsky piece. Early years Hanson was born in the Sydney suburb of Burwood on 23 November 1913, the youngest of five children to Australian-born railroad engineer William Hanson, and his English- born wife Lilian, née Bennett. The marriage broke up when Hanson was quite young. Hanson was sickly as a child, suffering from bronchial complaints and a recurring ear infection that left him almost deaf in his left ear. He began experimenting in musical composition from the age of eight, inspired by his older sister's piano practice. Hanson's mother brought him up as a Baptist, and though he later left the faith he retained a lifelong interest in spirituality. Hanson attended Burwood Public and Fort Street High Schools, but left before completing his third year. He continued however to pursue piano lessons, aided by teacher Anne Spillane who kindly provided him with free lessons as his family was too poor to pay for them. He was thereby eventually able, in 1930 at the age of seventeen, to gain the Licentiate (piano) of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. From 1930 until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he made a living by teaching piano and by working in a variety of menial jobs. Hanson was able to give a number of recitals of his own compositions in the late 1930s, and had the opportunity to gain some formal training in composition after being awarded the Gordon Vickers Scholarship at the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music. Unfortunately, his Conservatorium studies would last only two months before the war interrupted them. He joined the Army in 1941, eventually rising to the rank of Sergeant in the Army Education Service. During the war he was exposed to, and developed a lasting interest in, jazz music, an interest that would come to have some influence on his own work. He left the Army in 1946.Australian Dictionary of Biography Online. Teaching career As the recipient of a Fellowship in Composition, Hanson after the war was able to resume his studies at the Conservatorium. Following a year of study which he undertook with Alex Burnard, the Conservatorium offered Hanson a place on the staff, and this he accepted. He became a teacher of Aural Training, in which he was considered something of an innovator, and later a lecturer in Harmony and Composition, Counterpoint and Aesthetics of Music. He was also active in curriculum development and assisted in the introduction of the Bachelor of Music Education degree. As a teacher, Hanson was noted for a kind, thoughtful and unpretentious manner, which was appreciated by students, while his abilities and dedication were greatly respected. He became a teacher and mentor to many future Australian composers and musicians, such as Nigel Butterley, Richard Meale and Barry Conyngham, as well as to noted performers such as jazz clarinettist Don Burrows and piano virtuoso Roger Woodward. In addition to his work at the Conservatorium, he also gave private lessons, which not infrequently ended in long discussions about philosophy or politics. Political activity Hanson himself became active in political matters when, in the early 1950s, he joined the Australian Cultural Defence Movement which sought to protect Australian culture from being swamped by foreign influences, particularly the United States and Americanization. In the prevailing mood of the times however, the movement was painted as leftist and pro-communist, and quickly crumbled. Hanson believed that his association with this movement, along with his membership in the Australian-Soviet Friendship Society, was one of the factors that held back his professional career. Music While his teaching abilities were widely acknowledged, Hanson struggled to gain recognition for his talents as a composer for much of his career, as his music was often unpopular with the audience at that time and also unfashionable. He was fifty-four years old before receiving his first commission for a piece of music,Australian Music Centre. and many of his works lay unperformed for many decades. Part of the problem lay with his independence of mind. Hanson ignored prevailing trends in the pursuit of his own muse. In the 1940s and 1950s, his work was regarded by his Australian contemporaries as too avant-garde, but by the 1960s it was being dismissed as not avant-garde enough. Hanson's rejection of serialism, responsible for the latter dismissal, was ultimately vindicated by history, but this vindication came late in his career. In 1971 he won the Albert H. Maggs Composition Award. Style Hanson's unique qualities as a composer were noticed early by English critic Neville Cardus, who perceived, after attending a concert featuring Hanson's works in 1941, \\"an originality that avoided Anglocentrism\\".New Grove Dictionary. His music has also been described as \\"of a style not usually associated with Australian composition\\".Australian Digital Thesis Program, University of Wollongong Library. Hanson himself eschewed the notion of a uniquely \\"Australian\\" style, but some have nevertheless heard an \\"unmistakeable\\" influence of the Australian landscape in his works.Sitsky & Martin. Others, by contrast, have detected traces of English pastoralism. Particularly crucial to Hanson were the compositions and the pedagogic theories of Paul Hindemith (\\"I still think Hindemith has the answers to so many things ... If you want to be incomprehensible, go and get it. I don't\\").Murdoch, James (1972), Australia's Contemporary Composers (Melbourne: Macmillan), 112. Another figure who had a powerful impact on Hanson's philosophy was the Indian poet and musician Rabindranath Tagore. Hanson's deep spirituality (he once considered becoming a missionary to India) played a notable part in his creative outlook. His appreciation of jazz is apparent in the sense of spontaneity and rhythmic fluidity that he strove to bring to his own pieces. He had a gift for improvisation and often composed directly at the keyboard. Technically speaking, Hanson rejected serialism with its rigid rules of development, but retained a fascination with the twelve-note scale and its full potentialities. This should not be taken to indicate, however, that he disdained melody. On the contrary, he has been described as \\"a lyrical composer who thought naturally in evolving lines\\". Personal life On 15 September 1956, Hanson at the age of 43 married a 23-year-old Conservatorium student, Moira Winifred Young, at St. Matthew's Anglican Church, Manly. The marriage was a very happy union despite the unconventionality of the age difference. The couple moved house several times over the next few years as prior to Hanson being placed on salary all teaching staff at the Con were contract players. Hanson's health deteriorated and in 1967 he suffered a heart attack. Young died in 1975, and after being appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in January 1976,It's an Honour: AM Hanson himself died of myocardial infarction later that year, on 6 December. The couple were survived by three daughters. During his life, Hanson sometimes commented on his pride in being born within 24 hours of the birth of his musical hero Benjamin Britten.\\"Composer gets a fresh hearing\\" by Vincent Plush, The Australian, 22 November 2012 His death, also, came only two days after Britten's. Works Hanson left behind over 100 major works, including a symphony, four concertos, a ballet, an opera, an oratorio, cantatas, chamber works and piano music. He also wrote film, television and radio scores, as well as jazz music and arrangements. More notable works include his 1948 Trumpet Concerto, released worldwide on the RCA label, the technically demanding Piano Sonata (composed between 1938 and 1941, and reflecting his feelings about the Fall of France), the piano Preludes, and his Violin Concerto. Hanson also set many of Tagore's poems to music, his most ambitious work in this regard being the 1976 oratorio The Immortal Touch. Many of Hanson's works, such as the Violin Concerto, went unperformed for many years, and his 1941 Piano Sonata was only finally published in 1976, on the day of his death.

Fr. Joseph Spillmann S.J. Joseph Spillmann (b. at Zug, Switzerland, 22 April 1842; d. at Luxembourg, 23 February 1905) was a Swiss Jesuit children's author. Life He attended the primary school and gymnasium in Zug, but bad health necessitated his leaving his studies and devoting himself to his father's business. At the age of sixteen he resumed his interrupted studies at the Jesuit college of Feldkirch. Having entered the Jesuit novitiate at Gorheim (1862), he was sent, during the Franco-Prussian War (1870), to nurse the sick. Ten years later, when his order was banished from Germany, he went to England to complete his theological studies, and in 1874 was ordained priest. Works Spillmann's importance arises chiefly from his works for the young. He had already shown a poetic gift in his contributions to \\"Der Hausfreund\\" (a calendar published by Father Pachtler in 1872), and his work was clearly marked out for him. He was appointed collaborator on the \\"Stimmen aus Maria-Laach\\" (founded in 1871) and the \\"Katholische Missionen\\" (founded in 1873). Spillmann's literary activity resulted chiefly from his connection with these periodicals, especially the \\"Katholische Missionen\\" which he edited from 1880 to 1890. From his \\"Beilagen für die Jugend\\" grew seventy portly volumes of the \\"Reisebilder\\", while twenty-one booklets, \\"Aus fernen Landen\\" owe their origin to the same source; those consisted of edifying illustrated stories for the young. His comprehensive \\"Geschichte der Katholikenverfolgung in England von 1535-1681\\" began with articles in the \\"Stimmen aus Maria-Laach\\", was continued in the supplements to this periodical, and was completed in five large volumes. For the calendar, the \\"Hausfreund\\", which was given up in 1881, Spillman wrote many stories; these were afterwards collected under the title, \\"Wolken und Sonnenschein, eight pretty stories for the young which have been frequently republished and translated into other languages. Spillmann also wrote seven longer romances, the first (Die Wunderblume von Woxindon) appearing in 1893; and the last (Der schwarze Schuhmacher) ten years later; they are written in the styles of Sir Walter Scott and Charles Dickens. An eighth romance was sketched, but a serious illness prevented its completion.

It is near the disused railway station, reached by a long footpath off the main road, at grid ref: J481404. It is a large and impressive circle lying in cultivated lowland, less than 100 ft above sea level, in the heart of the fertile Lecale peninsula. (Latitude: 54.290937N Longitude: 5.726292W) Features It is a large and complex site which appears as a large circle of over 50 closely spaced upright stones, some as much as six feet tall, with some small gaps, surrounding a space about 110 ft across. Two of the fallen stones have cavities which could be artificial cup-marks. The stones of the outer circle are nearly all composed of local Silurian grit, but a few are granite erratics. Two of the stones stand 7 ft apart immediately outside the circle on the west, and there are four outlying stones, two on the north-east (9 and 40 yards from the circle) and two on the south-west (9 and 50 yards from the circle). In the eastern half of the circle is an oval mound contained within a kerb with diameters of 46 and 58 ft, with the long axis on an east–west alignment. Immediately inside the circle on the west, opposite a pair of external stones, is an arc of six stones supporting the edge of a raised platform which occupies much the same position as the oval mound on the east. Excavations found that the mound was of stony earth, with a stone cairn at the core. Under the mound, between the cairn and the kerb were found a number of smooth boulders (baetyls) set in the old surface. Large cists were found at the east and west ends of the mound containing cremated bones. It would seem that a kerbed round mound in the passage tomb tradition was added to the east end of a long cairn in the court tomb tradition, with a stone circle encompassing this composite structure. The site is the result of long development, and a late Neolithic to earlier Bronze Age date range is likely, as it seems to span several different building phases. Aubrey Burl has noted that a number of the characteristic features of the Ballynoe circle (its diameter, outlying stones and north–south alignment) are closely paralleled in Cumbria. Excavations The mound was excavated in 1937–38 by Dutch archaeologist, Dr AE Van Giffen, who died before publishing his examination of the site. The excavation concentrated on the mound, finding stone cists containing cremated bones. The only pottery recovered was from a small cremation pocket outside the mound and was a decorated rim sherd of Carrowkeel (passage grave) ware. There was a random scatter of cremation pockets between the mound and the stone circle. The excavations failed to satisfactorily explain the relationship between the various parts of the site.

Life He studied in the University of Tübingen and was ordained priest in 1848; he then took a course of philology in the University of Munich and became professor in the Gymnasium at Ellwangen. In 1856 Pachtler entered the Society of Jesus, and some years later was appointed professor in the Jesuit College of Feldkirch, Austria. His educational labours were interrupted twice, when he acted as military chaplain to the Tyrolese troops during the Italian campaign (1866), and to German volunteers in the papal army (1869–70). After the expulsion of the Society of Jesus from the German Empire (1872), Pachtler lived mostly in the Netherlands and Austria, devoting himself to literary work. Works He was the first editor of the Stimmen aus Maria- Laach, published by the German Jesuits, one of the leading Catholic periodicals in Germany. He was a prolific writer on questions of the day: the First Vatican Council, the Roman question, the labour movement, Freemasonry, and Liberalism. He accused the Freemasons of trying to destroy Christianity, and inciting the Kulturkampf.Roisin Healy, The Jesuit Specter in Imperial Germany (2003), p. 76. Among his works are: *\\"Acta et Decreta Sacrosancti et Oecumenici Concilii Vaticani\\" (1871), *\\"Die Internationale Arbeiterverbindung\\" (1871), *\\"Der Götze der Humanität oder das Positive der Freimaurerei\\" (1875), *\\"Der stille Krieg gegen Thron und Altar, oder das Negative der Freimaurerei\\" (1873), *\\"Der Europäische Militarismus\\" (1876), *\\"Die Geistige Knechtung der Völker durch das Schulmonopol des modernen Staates\\" (1876), *\\"Das göttliche Recht der Familie und der Kirche auf die Schule\\" (1879). His book on the reform of higher education: \\"Die Reform unserer Gymnasien\\" (1883), attracted the attention of German educationists, and he was invited to become a contributor to the \\"Monumenta Germaniae Paedagogica\\", published in Berlin under the editorship of Karl Kehrbach. He contributed four volumes (II, V, IX, and XVI of the series, 1887–94), the last being edited by Father Bernhard Duhr, S.J., after the author's death. Pachtler's volumes form the standard work on the educational system of the Jesuits; it is entitled: \\"Ratio Studiorum et Institutiones Scholasticae Societatis Jesu, per Germaniam olim Vigentes\\". The work contains the official documents of the society which have reference to education, parts of the constitutions, decrees of the legislative assemblies of the order, ordinances of generals, reports of official visitations, the various revisions of the Ratio Studiorum, schedules of study, disciplinary regulations, directions for the training of teachers, and treatises of private individuals which explain the practical working of the system.

Units of Yeomanry Cavalry were raised in the East Riding of Yorkshire in the 18th and early 19th centuries at times of national emergency: the Jacobite Rising of 1745, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. These were stood down once each emergency was over. The East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry, was established in 1902, and this saw action during the First World War both in the mounted role and as machine gunners. It was converted to armoured regiment in 1920, and fought in the Battle of France and the campaign in North West Europe during the Second World War, while some of its personnel served as paratroopers in the Normandy landings and the Rhine Crossing. In 1956, it merged with two other Yorkshire yeomanry regiments to form the Queen's Own Yorkshire Yeomanry. Its lineage is continued today by the Queen's Own Yeomanry. Precursor unit A number of companies of Volunteer infantry and artillery were formed in Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire for coast defence during the Jacobite Rising of 1745. At the same time John Hall- Stevenson and 'a number of fox-hunting gentlemen and yeomen of the county', formed themselves into a cavalry unit named the Yorkshire Light Horse. They invited Major-General James Oglethorpe to be their Colonel, and he obtained the King's permission to change its title to the Royal Regiment of Hunters. It is claimed that this was the first unit of Yeomanry cavalry formed in Britain. The unit of foxhunters did some useful patrol work, and participated in Oglethorpe's winter pursuit of the rebel retreat to Shap and the Clifton Moor Skirmish, when its strength was reported to be up to 1500 well-mounted men.Norfolk, pp. 7–8, Appendix I.Wright, pp. 357–60. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars After Britain was drawn into the French Revolutionary Wars, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger proposed on 14 March 1794 that the counties should form a force of Volunteer Yeoman Cavalry that could be called on by the King to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the county. By the end of the year 27 counties had raised Yeomanry, including East Yorkshire.Rogers, p. 145. Thomas Grimston of Grimston offered to raise a cavalry force in Holderness. He issued 'Articles of Enlistment' based on those of the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and then travelled round the Holderness villages explaining his plans to the yeomen farmers. Their response was poor, even when Grimston got the local clergy to explain the plan to their parishioners. The main complaint was the low level of pay for attending drills, and unwillingness to turn out during harvest time. They were also unwilling to serve outside the East Riding, and Grimston changed the proposed name of his unit from 'East York' to 'East Riding' (formally, the East Riding Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry). Once these concerns were addressed, Grimston was able to recruit his Troop up to a strength of 58 men (against an establishment of 60) by September. He set about recruiting an ex-cavalryman to serve as troop sergeant to train the men, and obtaining uniforms and weapons. A similar Troop was raised by Captain William Hall as the Hull Gentleman and Yeomanry Cavalry.Norfolk, pp. 15-7.Norfolk, Appendix III. In February 1798 Captain Sir Christopher Sykes, 2nd Baronet, raised another Troop of 45 volunteers drawn from 16 parishes around Sledmere as the Yorkshire Wold Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry.Norfolk, p. 20 Meanwhile, the attempted French landing in South Wales in 1796 (the Battle of Fishguard) led the government to double the strength of the Militia with a new Supplementary Militia including units of Provisional Cavalry. Unlike the Yeomanry, service in these units was not voluntary, but decided by ballot, one horse-owner in every 10 being selected to serve or provide a fully equipped trooper. The East York Provisional Cavalry consisted of Troops based at Hull, Beverley, Driffield, Bridlington and Hunmanby under the command of the Lord Lieutenant (the Duke of Leeds). The force was extremely unpopular, and was never embodied, though called out occasionally for training. It was disbanded in March 1799. The preliminaries to the Treaty of Amiens in 1801 saw most of the Yeomanry disbanded, but the peace was short-lived, and Britain declared war on France again in May 1803, beginning the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Thomas Grimston quickly reformed his unit, now titled the Grimston Yeomanry Cavalry and consisting of two Troops. Similarly, Sir Mark Masterman-Sykes, 3rd Baronet, reformed his father's Yorkshire Wolds Yeomanry Cavalry, now with 300 members and himself ranked as Lieutenant-Colonel. Captain Marmaduke Constable- Maxwell of Everingham formed a new troop of 45 men as the Everingham Yeomanry Cavalry. Captain William Hall offered to reform the Hull Yeomanry Cavalry, but the offer was not acknowledged by the Lord Lieutenant and he withdrew the offer; no new cavalry unit was raised in Hull for the rest of the war.Norfolk, p. 24.Norfolk, Appendix IV. In 1808 a new Local Militia was formed, which replaced many of the Volunteer units. The Yorkshire Wolds Yeomanry Cavalry transferred to the new force, but the Grimston and Everingham Troops remained independent voluntary units until they were disbanded at the nd of the war in 1814.Norfolk, p. 33. For the rest of the 19th century there was no Yeomanry regiment in the East Riding: men who wished to serve could join the North Riding-based Yorkshire Hussars, which maintained detachments in Beverley and other East Yorkshire towns in the second half of the century.Norfolk, p. 39; Appendix V. Imperial Yeomanry Following a string of defeats during Black Week in early December 1899, the British government realised that it would need more troops than just the regular army to fight the Second Boer War. On 13 December, the decision to allow volunteer forces serve in the field was made, and a Royal Warrant was issued on 24 December. This officially created the Imperial Yeomanry (IY). The force was organised as county service companies of approximately 115 men, and volunteers (usually middle and upper class) quickly filled the new force, which was equipped to operate as mounted infantry.Rogers, p. 228.Spiers, p. 239.Dunlop, pp. 104–18.IY at Anglo-Boer War. The Yorkshire Hussars raised the 9th (Yorkshire (Doncaster)) Company and (with the Yorkshire Dragoons) the 66th (Yorkshire) Company for the first contingent. The 9th was replaced by the 109th (Yorkshire Hussars) Company in 1901.IY Companies at Roll of Honour. The concept was considered a success and before the war ended the existing Yeomanry regiments at home were converted into Imperial Yeomanry, and new regiments raised, including the East Riding of Yorkshire Imperial Yeomanry, which was approved on 15 April 1902. The unit was raised by Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock, Honorary Colonel of the 2nd East Riding Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) and a former Captain in the Yorkshire Hussars, who was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel on 15 May.London Gazette, 27 May 1902. His second-in-command was retired Major John Stracey- Clitherow, who had served in the Egyptian Campaign of 1882.Maj Roy Wilson, 'The Yeomanry cavalry', Military Modelling Vol 16, No 2, February 1986. By 1903 the new regiment had 400 men, in four squadrons at Hull, Beverley, York and Bridlington, and a Machine Gun Section.Army List, various dates. Uniform of the East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry 1908 A Squadron was based at the riding school in Walton Street, Hull. In 1911 this site was included in a new drill hall on Anlaby Road, Hull, which was shared with the 2nd Northumbrian Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (former 2nd East Yorks RGA) and named Wenlock Barracks after Lord Wenlock, who was Hon Colonel of both units. The Yeomanry regiment was popularly known as 'Wenlock's Horse'. It became a lancer regiment, with the appropriate uniform, in 1906.Hull at Great War Centenary Drill Halls.Hull at Drill Hall Project. Territorial Force The Imperial Yeomanry were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. The East Riding Yeomanry (TF) formed part of the TF's Yorkshire Mounted Brigade. At this time the regiment was organised as follows:Frederick, pp. 57–9.Conrad, British Army 1914.East Riding Yeomanry at Long, Long Trail.East Riding Yeomanry at Regimental Warpath. * Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) at Railway Street, Beverley * A Squadron at Hull * B Squadron at Beverley, with detachments at North Cave, Hornsea and Patrington * C Squadron at Fulford with a detachment at Dunnington * D Squadron at Driffield with detachments at Hunmanby, Pocklington, Settrington and Bridlington First World War Mobilisation The East Riding Yeomanry were mobilised on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914 under the command of Lt-Col P. Langdale, who had taken command on 6 June 1912. Under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the TF into being, it was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, after the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for 'Imperial Service'. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate regiments, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.  1/1st East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry The 1/1st moved north in November 1914 as Divisional Cavalry for the 2nd Northumbrian Division.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 51.63rd (2nd N) Division at Long, Long Trail.Yorkshire Mtd Bde at Regimental Warpath. On 20 May, the regiment formed part of a parade of some 40,000 men before H.M. The King and Lord Kitchener. The regiment was then ordered south to Filey and then to East Anglia, to form part of the 1/1st North Midland Mounted Brigade (later numbered as the 22nd Mounted Brigade). In October 1915, it set sail for Alexandria. In 1916, the regiment was part of the Western Frontier Force, a dreary job, causing a number of NCOs and men to join the newly formed Imperial Camel Corps and 120 officers and men to be detached for service under T. E. Lawrence. In December 1916, the 22nd Mounted Brigade moved to the Suez Canal Zone to form part of the ANZAC Mounted Division. The regiment first saw action during the First Battle of Gaza, a hard engagement for both the men and the horses, and in the Second Battle of Gaza it was posted to the far right flank. In General Allenby's reorganisation 22nd Mounted Brigade transferred to the Yeomanry Mounted Division.Becke, Pt2a, pp. 31–4. In October 1917, the regiment took part in the Third Battle of Gaza, and on 13 November at El Mughar, supported a charge by 6th Mounted Brigade. 'A' Squadron, commanded by Maj. J.F.M. Robinson M.C.,The Battle for Palestine, John D. Grainger led 22nd Mounted Brigade, having captured their objective they pressed on to Akir and established a position on the far side of the village square, however they had to withdraw as they were unsupported by the rest of the brigade. Sadly it transpired that the village was the location of a Turkish Corps Headquarters, and had the success of the attack been exploited then a major dislocation of the enemy lines could have resulted. El Mughar was the last great cavalry charge of the British Army. In December 1917, with the exception of the machine gun section, the regiment was dismounted and sent to France. From 7 April 1918, together with the Lincolnshire Yeomanry, it formed 'D' Bn, Machine Gun Corps (Mobile), redesignated 102nd Bn from 19 August.Frederick, p. 372.  2/1st East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry The 2nd Line regiment was formed in September 1914. In 1915 it was under the command of the 2/1st Yorkshire Mounted Brigade in Yorkshire (along with the 2/1st Yorkshire HussarsYorkshire Hussars at Long, Long Trail. and the 2/1st Queen's Own Yorkshire DragoonsYorkshire Dragoons at Long, Long Trail) and by March 1916 was in the Beverley area. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were numbered in a single sequence and the brigade became 18th Mounted Brigade, still in Yorkshire under Northern Command. In July 1916, there was a major reorganisation of 2nd Line yeomanry units in the United Kingdom. All but 12 regiments were converted to cyclists and as a consequence the regiment was dismounted and the brigade converted to 11th Cyclist Brigade. Further reorganisation in October and November 1916 saw the brigade redesignated as 7th Cyclist Brigade in November, now in the Bridlington area. About May 1918 the Brigade moved to Ireland and the regiment was stationed at Bandon and Fermoy, County Cork. There were no further changes before the end of the war. The regiment was disbanded at Fermoy on 12 December 1919.  3/1st East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry The 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915; that summer it was affiliated to the 5th Reserve Cavalry Regiment at York. Early in 1917, it was absorbed by the 1st Reserve Cavalry Regiment at The Curragh. Between the Wars On 7 February 1920, the Regiment was reconstituted in the Territorial Army (TA) with headquarters at Walton Street, Hull. Following the experience of the war, it was decided that only the fourteen most senior yeomanry regiments would be retained as horsed cavalry, with the rest being transferred to other roles. As a result, on 23 August 1920, the Regiment was one of eight converted and reduced to the 26th (East Riding of York Yeomanry) Armoured Car Company, Tank Corps. The Tank Corps became the Royal Tank Corps on 18 October 1923, and on 4 April 1939 the Royal Tank Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC). By 1939, it had become clear that a new European war was likely to break out, and the doubling of the TA was authorised, with each unit forming a duplicate. On 24 August the 1st East Riding Yeomanry was reconstituted in the RAC as a Divisional Cavalry Regiment (Mechanised) equipped with 28 light tanks, 44 carriers and 41 motorcycles. At the same time, it formed its duplicate 2nd East Riding Yeomanry. Second World War  1st East Riding Yeomanry =Battle of France= On 30 March 1940, after training at Tidworth, the 1st Regiment joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France as part of the 1st Armoured Reconnaissance Brigade, initially the Corps Cavalry to III Corps. However, in May, the Regiment passed under the command of 48th (South Midland) Division, 44th (Home Counties) Division, Macforce, and finally back to 48th (South Midland) Division.Joslen, p. 146. The Regiment was first involved in fighting near Ath, south of Brussels, and then over the next fortnight fought seven rearguard actions before being finally surrounded at Cassel on the night of 29/30 May while acting as rearguard to 145th Infantry Brigade. Sherman tanks of 1st ERY parked at the side of a raod in England during Exercise Fabius, May 1944. =Training= The remnants of 1ERY (7 officers and 230 men) returned to Tidworth, where the Regiment was brought up to strength by drafts from the 2nd Regiment, before moving on to Bovington to rejoin 1st Armoured Reconnaissance Brigade. The regiment next deployed to Essex for anti-invasion duties, where it was equipped with Beaverettes. When new material became available in Spring 1942, the Regiment reequipped with Covenanter tanks and Honeys, and together with the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards (replaced by the Staffordshire Yeomanry in January 1944) and the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, it formed 27th Armoured Brigade in 79th Armoured Division ('Hobart's Funnies'), experimenting with specialist assault armour.Joslen, p. 178.Dohrty, pp. 35–6. In April 1943, the Regiment again re-equipped, this time with Sherman Duplex Drive tanks. Between 8 October 1943 and 17 February 1944, 1ERY formed part of 33rd Tank Brigade in 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division before returning to the 27th.Joslen, p. 206. Sherman tank of the 1st ERY being loaded onto an LST at Gosport, 1 June 1944. =North West Europe= The training all came to fruition on 6 June 1944, when the Regiment landed on Sword Beach on D Day supporting 9th Infantry Brigade in 3rd British Infantry Division,Joslen, pp. 584–5. After the failure to seize Caen on D-Day, 3rd Division's task was to capture the high ground north of the town. Next day 1ERY supported an unsuccessful attack by the 2nd Bn Royal Ulster Rifles on Cambes-en-Plaine, one of the enemy's strongest positions in this part of the front. Two days later the two units had to advance over of flat, open land under artillery, mortar and machine gun fire. They were supported by four AVREs of 79th Assault Squadron, Royal Engineers, and Sherman Crab flail tanks of A Squadron of the Westminster Dragoons from 79th Armoured Division. The infantry suffered over 200 casualties and 1ERY lost four tanks, while all the AVREs (forced to act as infantry tanks) were knocked out, but after hard fighting the battle group gained their objective.Ellis, p. 228.Doherty, pp. 92–3. Major W Holtby, commanding 'C' Squadron, East Riding Yeomanry, 27th Armoured Brigade, briefs troop commanders in front of his HQ Sherman tank, 28 June 1944. For 50 days after the landings 1ERY took part in the bridgehead battles. During this period, it also supported 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. Because of casualties, 27th Armoured Brigade was broken up on 29 July, and on 16 August 1ERY joined 33rd Armoured Brigade,Joslen, p. 183. taking over the petrol Mk1 & II Shermans of 148 Regt RAC. The regiment was now attached to 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, for the final Falaise Pocket Battles, the advance to the River Seine, its crossing and the taking of St Valery-en-Caux; after which the Regiment transferred to 49th (West Riding) Division for the Battle of Le Havre. In October, the regiment supported 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, in the Netherlands fighting around 's-Hertogenbosch and the later crossing of the Maas. However, during the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944, it was hurried away to reinforce the pressure being put on the German \\"Bulge\\". Infantry cross the Rhine aboard a Buffalo, 28 March 1945 =Rhine crossing= In January 1ERY and 33rd Armd Bde rejoined 79th Armoured Division and re-equipped with Buffalo amphibious vehicles for the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder) on 23/24 March.Doherty, p. 163. Captain Peter Clemence of 1ERY was responsible for lighting the routes to the Buffaloes were to take to the water. This involved daylight reconnaissance of the riverbank under enemy fire as well as placing the lights under fire on the night of the operation. Clemence was awarded the Military Cross (MC).Doherty, p. 171. 1ERY's role in the operation was to carry the assault troops of 227th (Highland) Brigade, 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, with one troop of 6 Buffaloes allocated to each assaulting infantry company and two troops to each battalion for essential equipment such as 6-pounder anti-tank guns, wireless carriers and medical jeeps. The operation was practised behind the lines on the River Maas, during which one of the ERY Buffaloes overturned and its driver and co-driver were drowned. One participant commented that 'The yeomanry responsible for the actual crossing were delightful lot to work with, with a fine cavalry dash and a persistently horsey outlook, even in the water, when the squadron commanders were heard urging their drivers to \\"get their whips out\\".'Saunders, p. 146. 15th (S) Division's assault (Operation Torchlight) began at 02.00 on 24 March, and at first things went well for 1ERY and 227 Bde: two companies of 10th Bn Highland Light Infantry and three of 2nd Bn Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders crossed the river without difficulty. Unfortunately, the Buffaloes carrying A and C Companies of the HLI had got off course in the darkness, and both were landed upstream of their allotted landing zones. A section of riverbank manned by a German parachute battalion remained uncleared, and B and C Companies, following up, were also landed in the wrong place. By dint of hard fighting and heavy artillery support, the HLI cleared up the confusion by 09.00, allowing the transport to begin landing. On the Argylls' front, five out of six Buffaloes assigned to D Company were unable to climb the riverbank, and had to land their passengers some way away. D Company had to fight their way for a mile round before the could join in the fight for their objective. However, the Argylls were reinforced and got the job done.Martin, pp. 275–86.Saunders, pp. 145-51,159–68. Acting Lance-Corporal Adams of 1EYR was the driver of his Troop Commander's Buffalo; having returned from the far bank with a group of wounded and prisoners, they came under shellfire while unloading. Adams shielded one of the stretcher cases from shrapnel with his own body, while the Buffalo was badly holed and some of the German prisoners were killed. Adams was awarded the Military Medal (MM).Doherty, p. 172. Despite operating under fire for four days, the regiment only suffered one man wounded during Operation Plunder.Doherty, p. 179. For the last weeks of the war, the Regiment reconverted to Shermans, coming under the command of the First Canadian Army clearing the Netherlands. After the war the Regiment was stationed at Laboe (Kiel Estuary) until being placed in ‘suspended animation’ on 7 March 1946.  2nd East Riding Yeomanry The 2nd ERY was formed as a Royal Armoured Corps regiment as a duplicate of the 1st Regiment on 24 August 1939. On 25 June 1940, it was converted to infantry as the 10th (East Riding) Battalion, Green Howards. From the start of 1943, it started training as parachutists and on 1 June the battalion became the 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion, of the Parachute Regiment, part of the British Army's airborne forces. The battalion was serving alongside the 7th and 13th Parachute Battalions assigned to the 5th Parachute Brigade, which was part of the 6th Airborne Division. The battalion made combat drops on 6 June 1944 (Operation Overlord) and 28 March 1945 (Operation Varsity).Joslen, p. 413 The 'marching' elements of the division were ferried across the Rhine by 1st East Riding Yeomanry and 11th Royal Tank Regiment.Doherty, p. 175. Postwar The 1st ERY was reformed in the TA on 1 January 1947. In 1951 its title was officially shortened to East Riding Yeomanry (as it had always been commonly known). In 1956, the East Riding Yeomanry was merged with two other yeomanry regiments (the Yorkshire Hussars and the Yorkshire Dragoons) as the Queen's Own Yorkshire Yeomanry, which was formed on 1 April 1967, as a TAVR III unit with the RHQ and 'A' Squadron at York, 'B' Squadron at Doncaster and 'C Squadron at Hull. Then, on 1 April 1969, the regiment was reduced to a cadre and finally reformed on 1 April 1971 as 'A' Squadron The Queen's Own Yeomanry.ERY at British Army 1945 onwards. 12th (Yorkshire) Battalion, Parachute Regiment, was reconstituted in the TA on 1 March 1947. On 1 October 1956 it was amalgamated with 13th (Lancashire) Battalion. Uniforms and insignia Grimston's troop raised in 1794 wore short scarlet Hussar-style jackets with buff facings and silver braid (though Grimston himself wore a blue tunic). A standard Light Dragoon or Yeomanry Tarleton helmet was worn with buff 'turban' and hackle. The whitened leather crossbelt bore a plate engraved with 'E.R.Y.C.' (for East Riding Yeomanry cavalry) surrounded by a scroll bearing the motto Pro aris et focis ('for our altars and hearths', or more colloquially, 'for hearth and home'). The yeomen wore white breeches and black riding boots. The Hull Troop wore a green uniform with green facings and Yeomanry helmet, and the uniform of the Yorkshire Wold Troop is also believed to have been green. The East York Provisional Cavalry wore a green uniform with red facings. The East Riding Yeomanry marching along Toll Gavel, Beverley, ca 1910. When the Grimston Yeomanry were reformed in 1803 they continued to wear the scarlet uniform with buff facings and silver braid, but now with scarlet pantaloons. The reformed Yorkshire Wold Troop now wore scarlet with green facings. The Everingham Troop adopted scarlet with yellow facings and white pantaloons. The East Riding of Yorkshire Imperial Yeomanry wore serge khaki uniforms in drill order, with staff cap and brown equipment. The walking out dress comprised a Slouch hat and a serge tunic with blue plastron front, shoulder straps and waistbelt.

They are native to regions of Belize and Guatemala.  History  In the 18th and 19th centuries, the British forced the Mopan out of Belize and into Guatemala. There, they endured forced labour and high taxation. They migrated from Petén, Guatemala to avoid this forced labor and taxation. The Mopan originally settled near modern Pueblo Viaja, but Guatemalan officials claimed that they were still within bounds of Guatemala, so they moved further east around 1889 and founded San Antonio in Belize. In the 2010 Census, 10,557 Belizeans reported their ethnicity as Mopan Maya. This constituted approximately 3% of the population.  Culture  The Mopan Maya people practice a spirituality that relates to the Maya Catholic Faith. The prominent factor that has caused the decline of these traditional practices is the influence of Protestant evangelical missionaries. There is an absence of written traditions of the Mopan Maya people, so the preservation of their culture relies on oral transmission.  Language  The language of the Mopan people is Mopan language. It is a member of the Yucatec Maya language branch of the Mayan languages. Several thousand Mopan people, located in Belize and Guatemala, speak the Mopan language.  Religion  The Cacao tree has played a significant role in the religious life of the Mopan Maya people. The Cacao tree is known as ceremonial tree in the Mopan Community. The tree is locally known as cucu. Both the tree itself and its beans that it produces are said to contain spirits. The traditional religion of the Mopan people is Maya- Catholic. In this religion, the Mopan Maya people consume Cacao beverages at religious celebrations. However, since the 1970s, numerous Mopan villagers have left the Maya Catholic faith and joined Protestant groups. As a result, they reject beliefs related to spiritual aspects of the natural world.  Agriculture  The economy of the Mopan Community is based on agriculture. The Mopan people have a long history of being small holder, independent farmers.

The FTC has contacted leading book retailers, Amazon, major and independent book publishers to help determine the impact, if any, from the sale. Lawsuits In 1999, Baker & Taylor paid a settlement of $3 million USD to the U.S. government to settle a federal lawsuit.

Formation The gang was initially formed during the mid-1870s by disgruntled small ranchers, feeling themselves victimized by the large cattle holdings of ranchers such as John Chisum. In 1876 they allied themselves with the Murphy-Dolan faction, mainly due to John Tunstall and Alexander McSween being allied with Chisum. The gang was led, for the most part, by Henry M. \\"Hugh\\" Beckwith, whose brothers John and Bob were also members. The gang had certain influential connections with local law enforcement, which assisted in their being able to carry out cattle rustling without interference: Bob Beckwith and Wallace Olinger were Deputy Sheriffs for Sheriff William J. Brady, and gang member Bob Olinger was a Deputy US Marshal. Tom Walker, an uncle to later famed Texas Ranger Lon Oden, also became a member. Lincoln County War The gang began harassing the Tunstall-McSween faction in 1876, often riding with the Jesse Evans Gang and the John Kinney Gang, with both those gangs also being employed by the Murphy- Dolan faction. On February 18, 1878, members of the Evans Gang led by Jesse Evans killed John Tunstall, sparking the Lincoln County War. The Lincoln County Regulators were formed shortly thereafter to counter the gunmen hired by Murphy-Dolan. The Regulators included Billy the Kid, Richard \\"Dick\\" Brewer, Charlie Bowdre and Doc Scurlock, but numbered some forty riders in all. On April 1, 1878, Sheriff Brady and Deputy Sheriff George Hindman were killed by Billy the Kid and other Regulators in Lincoln, New Mexico. On April 29, 1878, members of the Seven Rivers Gang killed Regulator Frank McNab and badly wounded Regulator Ab Saunders, in addition to capturing Frank Coe. On April 30, 1878, Seven Rivers members Tom Green, Charles Marshall, Jim Patterson and John Galvin were killed in Lincoln, and although the Regulators were blamed, that was never proven, and there were feuds going inside the Seven Rivers Warriors at that time. What is known for certain is that Seven Rivers member \\"Dutch Charlie\\" Kruling was shot and wounded by Regulator George Coe on the morning of April 30. Some time after this, Seven Rivers gang member Wallace Olinger allowed Frank Coe to escape, giving him a pistol in the process. The Regulators tracked down and killed Seven Rivers rider Manuel Segovia on May 15, 1878, who was believed to have killed McNab with a shotgun. What would become known as the Battle of Lincoln began on July 15, 1878, lasting five days, with Bob Beckwith being killed during a gun battle with the Regulators on July 19. For all practical purposes, the Lincoln County War ended after that siege, despite the fight itself being a draw and with all but one of the Regulators escaping. Downfall After the range war came to an end, the Seven Rivers members began to turn on one another. Gang member Bill Johnson was killed by Hugh Beckwith on August 17, 1878, in Seven Rivers, New Mexico. John Beckwith was killed by fellow member John Jones on August 26, 1879, also in Seven Rivers. On November 23, 1879, gang member Tom Walker was killed in a saloon gunfight in Seven Rivers. Gang member and Deputy US Marshal Bob Olinger was killed by Billy the Kid, along with Deputy Sheriff James Bell, on April 28, 1881, during a jail escape. By this time the gang had fallen apart, with the members all going their own ways. Some went back to ranching or working as cowboys, while some became lawmen. Hugh Beckwith, the gang's leader, continued his outlaw life, but was shot and killed while committing the armed robbery of a general store in Presidio, Texas in 1892.

He was also a champion rower for New South Wales and won a national title in 1965. In the 1970s, Tutty won a landmark court case which removed trade restraints on rugby league players. Tutty primarily played at . Tutty is the brother of Olympian sculler Ian Tutty and cousin of Australian rugby league international Reg Gasnier. Early life The youngest son and second youngest child of a motor mechanic, Tutty was raised in the inner-western suburbs of Sydney. His secondary education was at Ibrox Park Boys High School and he left school after obtaining his Intermediate Certificate at the end of Year 9. At school he played a number of sports including Rugby League representing the school and the school's sports zone at various levels including a curtain raiser to an international match in 1962. After leaving school he joined the Leichhardt Wanderers Junior League Football Club in 1963, a junior team affiliated with the Balmain Tigers club. Like his older brother, Tutty rowed for the (then) Haberfield Rowing Club and for New South Wales. He rowed in the five seat of the New South Wales eight which won King's Cup in 1965. Playing career Tutty was graded to Balmain in 1964 at the age of seventeen . He became the youngest player to ever appear in a grand final when Balmain met St. George at the end of that season. He played ostensibly as an amateur so that he could continue to compete in what was then the strictly non-professional sport of rowing. In 1967, Tutty was selected to play in his only Test appearance, against New Zealand in the first Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In March 1968, citing unhappiness with the terms of his contract, Tutty applied to the Tigers for a clearance to play with another club. At the time, clubs were able to prevent any professional player who had played in one of its teams from playing with any other club, even if the player no longer played for the retaining club. The request was refused and Tutty then lodged an appeal with the New South Wales Rugby League. In May, he withdrew the appeal before it was heard and agreed to play for Balmain for the 1968 season for an increased remuneration. At the end of the 1968 season, Tutty applied once more to be placed on the transfer list but he was again refused and his name was placed on the 'retain' list. Tutty did not appeal the second refusal but sat out the 1969 season, not playing for any team. Tutty commenced legal action in May 1969. He fought for over two years for the right for players to transfer to another club. The New South Wales Equity Court granted Tutty's application to have the League's transfer system declared invalid, deeming it an 'unreasonable restraint of trade'. The League appealed to the High Court of Australia but on 13 December 1971, the High Court's judgement upheld the Equity Court's decision. The implications of Tutty's successful legal action were quickly felt throughout the game. In the first two months, South Sydney lost three internationals, John O'Neill, Ray Branighan and Ron Coote. After two years sitting out of the game, and while still waiting for a legal decision, Tutty returned to play for Balmain during 1971. He played seventeen games but did not receive any remuneration from the club. Tutty was free to play for the Penrith Panthers in 1972 and he remained with the club for three seasons. In 1975, Tutty moved to Eastern Suburbs. A broken arm during the season prevented him from participating in Easts' 38–0 win over St. George in the grand final. Tutty spent his final year in first- grade, 1976, back at Balmain. Coaching career Tutty spent one season as a first-grade coach, with Balmain in 1980. The season was not successful for the team or for Tutty, winning only seven games from twenty-two. He stood down at the end of the 1980 season and was succeeded by Frank Stanton. Tutty coached the Forster Tuncurry Hawks to successive Clayton Cup wins in 1994 and 1995. Post career recognition In 2008 the Rugby League Players Association instituted the \\"Dennis Tutty Clubman of the Year\\" award presented to the person who has \\"demonstrated the same qualities of self-sacrifice and courage as Dennis Tutty to achieve a better working environment for his fellow Rugby League Players\\". The inaugural recipient of the award was Jason King. In 2013 the award went to Clint Newton.

Life He was born in Lancashire, probably a younger son of John Rishton of Dunkenhalgh and Dorothy Southworth. He studied at the University of Oxford from 1568 to 1572, when he proceeded B.A. probably from Brasenose College. During the next year he was converted to Catholicism, and went to Douai College to study for the priesthood. He was the first Englishman to matriculate at Douai, and is said to have taken his M.A. degree there. While a student he drew up and published a chart of ecclesiastical history, and was one of the two sent to Reims in November, 1576, to see if the college could be removed there. After his ordination at Cambrai (6 April 1576) he was sent to Rome. In 1580 he returned to England, visiting Reims on the way, but was soon arrested. He was tried and condemned to death with Edmund Campion and others on 20 November 1581, but was not executed, being left in prison, first in the King's Bench prison, then in the Tower of London. On 21 January he was exiled with several others, being sent under escort as far as Abbeville, whence he made his way to Reims, arriving on 3 March. With the intention of taking his doctorate in divinity he proceeded to the University of Pont-à-Mousson in Lorraine, but the plague broke out, and though he went to Sainte-Ménehould, to escape the infection, he died of it and was buried there. Works At the suggestion of Robert Persons, he completed Nicholas Sanders's imperfect Origin and Growth of the Anglican Schism. After his death this book was published by Father Persons, and subsequent editions included two tracts attributed to Rishton, the one a diary of an anonymous priest in the Tower (1580-5), which was probably the work of Father John Hart, S.J.; the other a list of martyrs with later additions by Persons. Publication of the \\"Tower Bills\\" makes it certain that Rishton did not write the diary, and his only other known works are a tract on the difference between Catholicism and Protestantism (Douai, 1575) and Profession of his faith made manifest and confirmed by twenty-one reasons.

In August 1975, he re-joined his former club when Newcastle signed John Bird from Preston in exchange for Bruce and £60,000 – a transfer which prompted the resignation of Preston manager Bobby Charlton. On his return to Preston he struck up a successful strike partnership with Mike Elwiss and under manager Nobby Stiles helped guide Preston to league promotion in 1978, Bruce winning a golden boot by finishing the season as the league's highest goal scorer. He stayed at Preston until 1983 when he joined local side Wigan Athletic as a player and coach before retiring from football due to a knee injury in 1985. Following football, Alex forged a successful career in leisure management and finished his career as Head of Leisure at South Ribble Borough Council.

It means bringing together policy and its promoters aimed to unite the political parties and groups in favour of Weltpolitik (policy involving navy and colonial expansion) and also diminishing the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD), which other parties pretended to take seriously as a revolutionary socialist party. Most parties supported Weltpolitik but in 1909 the navy budget became controversial. Instead of choosing to tax the rich, the government chose to increase sales tax (increasing the price of goods), which led to its sudden loss of support from parties like the Deutsche Zentrumspartei and the Liberals. In 1912 election, the SPD gained 112 seats, making it the largest party in the Reichstag. Structuralist The Structuralist school of thought, led by Hans-Ulrich Wehler (who described Weltpolitik as the \\"manipulation process\\"), argued that Germany was not really controlled by the Kaiser but by the influence of four main groups in Germany, the Junkers (landowners), the army, industrialists and right wing pressure groups. Junkers Junker influence had an institutional base in the Agrarian League (est. 1893). The Prussian electoral system favoured them and allowed them to control the government of Prussia. As Prussia was the largest state in the Empire, more Prussians were elected into the Bundesrat and these were mainly Junker. The Prussian Junkers held 17 seats in the Bundesrat and 14 votes were needed for a veto. This gave them power in the Bundesrat. They used this power to block reforms that did not benefit them and to protect the interests of agriculture. \\"History, Modern British and European, publisher: Letts\\" Army The Army League of 1912 was created to advance the interests of the army and the part of the economy dependent on it. They exploited this to get 'favours' and as the Kaiser was head of the army a position he took very seriously and was obsessed by them, he filled the court with generals. It has been suggested by historians that during 1914 the army leaders had more influence than the Chancellor. The army used its influence to apply pressure on the Reichstag to pass the army bills of 1912 to 1913. Industrialists The Pan German League of 1891 tried to gain support for Wilhelm's Weltpolitik as a means of securing markets for Germany's manufactures and sources of raw materials. Their fear of socialism bound them to Weltpolitik as they hoped that the appeal to German nationalism would divert support from Socialism. Right-Wing Pressure Groups The Kaiser had a strong right-wing viewpoint due to his obsession with the army, which these groups could exploit to get their own views across.

She has been a series regular since the pilot episode, and has been played continuously by Kristin Kreuk, with two other actresses having portrayed Lana Lang as a child and as an elderly woman. The character of Lana Lang, first created for comic books by Bill Finger and John Sikela in the 1950s as a romantic interest for Superboy, was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville television series, none of which directly continues from or into the television episodes. In Smallville, Lana is the love interest for Clark Kent, though, in the first season she is dating Whitney Fordman. By season two, with Whitney's departure, Lana and Clark begin to grow closer. Clark's dishonesty over the secrets he is hiding causes their relationship to end. Lana then grows closer to Lex Luthor. Eventually Lana learns the truth about Clark and they get back together. After stealing a kryptonite-powered suit from Lex, Lana absorbs an enormous amount of kryptonite radiation, which prohibits her from getting too close to Clark, and she leaves Smallville for good, but vowed to continue to use her powers to preserve life. Initially, Lana is characterized as the intelligent \\"girl next door\\".Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.116–119 She eventually becomes a tragic figure in Smallville, as the decisions made by Clark and Lex change the character over the course of the show. As Gough explains, by the end of the sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own game. Over the course of the show, Lana transitions from the girl next door to a more \\"self-reliant young woman\\". Kreuk has been nominated for various awards for her portrayal of Lana Lang. Role in Smallville In the first season, Lana and Clark Kent (Tom Welling) are just beginning their friendship, as she is a popular cheerleader dating star quarterback Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson), and Clark cannot get near her without getting sick from the kryptonite necklace she wears. In the pilot episode, when her parents are killed in the first meteor shower, Lana (Jade Unterman) is adopted by her aunt Nell (Sarah-Jane Redmond). As the first season progresses, Lana grows closer to Clark, while Whitney begins to distance himself because of his father's medical ailments. In season two's episode \\"Heat\\" Lana sends Whitney, who left Smallville for the Marines in the season one finale, a video message breaking up with him. Lana's aunt Nell moves to Metropolis with her fiancé in the season two episode \\"Ryan\\", but Lana opts to move in with her friend Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) so that she may finish high school in Smallville. By the end of season two, Lana and Clark slowly try and start a romantic relationship, but fear backlash from Chloe because of her personal feelings for Clark. Just as the two give in to their feelings fully, Clark unexpectedly runs away from Smallville in the season two finale. At the start of season three, it is shown that Lana, alongside the Kents, has been spending her time searching for Clark; she ultimately finds him in Metropolis thanks to Chloe's help. Clark's actions in Metropolis force the two to rethink their relationship in the season three episode \\"Phoenix\\", and Lana eventually begins a new relationship with Adam Knight (Ian Somerhalder), a guy she met while in physical therapy after being trampled by a horse in season three's \\"Asylum\\". By the season three episode \\"Crisis\\", it is discovered that the relationship Adam attempted to form with Lana was just a ploy so that Adam could investigate Clark. Season three's \\"Forsaken\\" reveals that Lana, in order to move on with her life, applies and is admitted into a program to study in Paris, France. Season four shows that Lana, while in Paris, began a romantic relationship with Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles). At the beginning of season four, Lana returns to Smallville after receiving a mysterious tattoo on her lower back, which resembles a symbol on the local Kawatche cave walls, when she touched the tomb of Countess Margaret Isobel Theroux. In season four's \\"Spell\\" and \\"Sacred\\", the tattoo acts as a doorway for the spirit of Isobel to inhabit Lana's body; each time Isobel takes over Lana's body she sets out to find the three stones of knowledge, which are also being searched for by Clark and Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum). In the season four finale \\"Commencement\\", Lana is confronted by Jason's mother Genevieve (Jane Seymour), who is also after the three stones of knowledge, and during a struggle Isobel comes forward and kills Genevieve. The resulting death of Genevieve, who was revealed to have been the cause for Isobel's death centuries prior in the episode \\"Bound\\", releases Isobel's control over Lana. During the second meteor shower, Lana witnesses the landing of an alien spacecraft, and two alien beings emerging and killing everyone in sight in the season five premiere. The spaceship becomes Lana's primary focus in season five, officially teaming up with Lex Luthor to discover the mystery behind the ship in the episode \\"Splinter\\". When her relationship with Clark hits a breaking point in season five's \\"Hypnotic\\", she begins to grow closer to Lex. The relationship with Lex eventually leads to marriage in the season six episode \\"Promise\\", but not before Lana discovers Clark's secret and realizes why he has been lying to her all these years. When she learns that Lex set up a fake pregnancy in order to get her to marry him in the season six finale \\"Phantom\\", Lana effectively ends the marriage and fakes her own death to escape Lex after he threatens her. She also frames Lex for her murder, to punish him for his betrayal. It is revealed at the start of season seven that her effort fails, but as part of the \\"settlement\\" of their divorce, Lex makes sure that Lana does not go to jail for her actions. With Clark's secret no longer an issue, the two begin a real relationship in the season seven episode \\"Fierce\\". Lana becomes obsessed with making Lex pay for all his crimes against humanity, which causes her to develop the Isis Foundation, using $10 million she stole from Lex. The Isis Foundation is a counseling center for kryptonite- infected people, but it doubles as a front for Lana's surveillance on Lex. Her obsessions also begin to affect her relationship with Clark by the episode \\"Wrath\\". Eventually, Lana realizes that, even though she loves him, the only way for Clark to help the world to the best of his ability would be if she left Clark and Smallville for good, which she does in the season seven finale. In the season eight episode \\"Bride\\", Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), believing he is tracking Lex Luthor who has been missing since the season seven finale, discovers Lana instead. Oliver convinces her to return to Smallville so that she can attend Chloe's wedding. In the season eight episode \\"Power\\", it is revealed that Lana really returned so that she could steal Lex's \\"Prometheus\\" technology, which harnesses alien DNA to give the wearer of a \\"super-suit\\" superhuman abilities, for herself. By the end of the episode, the procedure is complete, and Lana becomes just as strong and invulnerable as Clark. In the episode \\"Requiem\\", Lana discovers that her suit absorbs kryptonite, but also emits the radiation making her a potential danger to Clark. When Winslow Schott puts a kryptonite bomb on the roof of the Daily Planet under Lex's orders, Lana is forced to absorb all of the kryptonite to deactivate the bomb. As a result, she leaves Smallville to go on her own quest as Clark can no longer get near her without the kryptonite radiation hurting him. Portrayal Creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar were initially trying to find someone for the role of Clark Kent, but Kristin Kreuk was the first to be cast, as Lana Lang. Casting director Coreen Mayrs sent David Nutter, the director of the pilot episode, a tape of 69 people and the second person on the tape was Kreuk. They loved her audition tape so much they immediately showed her to the network. For one of her auditions, she read the graveyard scene with Tom Welling; the network thought they had \\"great chemistry\\". Jade Unterman and Louise Grant portrayed the character as a child and an elderly woman, respectively. At the time she was cast as Lana, Kreuk had no idea who the character was in Superman lore. Her uncle, who owned a comic book shop, filled her in on the details and she learned more from the producers. Kreuk realized that the character in the comics and her character on the show were two different people. As a result, Kreuk learns about the development of Lana as Lana is learning in the show, just as Welling does with Clark Kent.Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.116-119 When asked if her being cast as a traditionally red haired character caused outcry from fans, Kreuk believes that whoever did \\"got over it pretty fast\\". By season three, Kreuk had decided to \\"invest\\" herself less in her character, as she felt that her character's ultimate development was entirely in the hands of the producers. She no longer became frustrated when the producers had Lana doing things that Kreuk felt were out of character, instead trusting that they would find the right direction for the character.Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion) pp.116-119 Kreuk enjoyed the fourth season because it gave her the chance to stretch her acting abilities with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, \\"That was a lot of fun; I thought it was funny as well […] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That was a lot of fun for me because the show [sometimes] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things.\\" Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's \\"Thirst\\", an experience she remembers as \\"uncomfortable\\" due to the fake blood they covered her in. Coincidentally, Annette O'Toole, who portrayed Martha Kent in the series, played Lana Lang in Superman III, starring Christopher Reeve. Character development Storyline progression One of the early turning points for the character came in season one's \\"X-Ray\\", when Lana discovers information about her parents that changes her perspective on them. It began with her mother's graduation speech, which showed that her mother was not as happy as her aunt had led her to believe. Lana's perception of her mother drove the way she led her own life, which was based on the idea of everyone perceiving her in a good light. In season two, Lana discovers that her mother had had an affair with a man named Henry Small, and that he was her biological father. This continued the idea established in season one that Lana's perception that her parents were this perfect couple was wrong. According to Kreuk, meeting her biological father allowed the character to realize that she had to create her own life, as the one she had envisioned did not actually exist. Season two also showed Lana's transition from the \\"girl next door\\" to a more \\"self-reliant young woman\\". At the beginning of the season Lana is forced to come to terms with her diminished feelings for Whitney, as well as her growing feelings for Clark. It takes time before Lana is strong enough to finally tell Whitney the truth, in a video message, about the way she feels. The Talon, a local coffee shop co-owned by Lana, becomes her new grounding force as Whitney and her aunt have left Smallville. Kreuk thinks that it can be hard to believe that a sixteen-year-old girl could become co-owner of a coffee shop, but she believes that it helps to provide more independence for the character and establish her more within the show. Eventually, in order to really get to know herself, and find her role in life, Lana leaves Smallville for Paris. In season four, Kristin Kreuk felt like Lana is \\"going a little crazy and is uncertain about her direction, and feels people aren't validating her beliefs\\".Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp. 116-119 Characterization At the start of the show, Lana Lang is characterized as the girl next door. As Kreuk describes her, she is the \\"beautiful, popular girl who is really lonely\\". She has a \\"hole in her heart\\", because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. Kristin feels that deep down the character is a \\"tough girl\\", and that Lex manages to bring that side of her out more. For instance, he convinces her to fight back against a rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon – the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, that tough side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark. Kreuk thinks that Lana \\"lived in her head a little bit\\"; she was intelligent enough to read classical books, but would also read romantic novels \\"on the sly\\". As Alfred Gough sees it, Lana is a by-product of Clark and Lex's decisions. She will always love Clark, and Clark will always love her, but it was Clark's bad decisions, and Lex's \\"basest instincts\\" that make Lana the \\"receptacle of all of these bad decisions\\", marking her as a tragic figure on the show. While Lana was with Clark, Kreuk characterizes her as a \\"wimpy, whiny kind of girl\\"; with Lex, Lana is \\"strong, powerful, and doesn't have to question, 'What is going on? What does he think? Does he love me? I don't know where I stand.'\\" To clarify, Lana's relationship with Lex brings out a darkness that had not been seen in the character. This is evident in \\"Nemesis\\" when Lana manipulates her way into seeing Lionel, only to interrogate him about why he forced her to marry Lex, as well as leaving Lex to die in the tunnels. As Gough explains, by the end of the sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own games. Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski feels that Lana is one of the most gullible characters on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic. Relationships When Smallville first began, Lana was in a romantic relationship with Whitney Fordman, the star quarterback of the football team. Kreuk believes that Lana truly was in love with Whitney when they first started dating, but by the time the audience first sees her in the pilot she is no longer in that same state of mind. Kreuk believes that by the time of the pilot Lana had grown “comfortable” with Whitney, and that was where their relationship ended. Though Lana had growing feelings for Clark, Kreuk feels that the producers rushed the coupling of Clark and Lana at the end of the second season. She believes that with everything that had happened throughout the season between the two characters, it seemed a bit of a stretch for Lana to just quickly fall into Clark's arms. The next season began to develop more of the relationship between Lex and Lana. Kreuk believes that Lana cares for Lex as a friend, and that she recognizes the \\"undertones\\" that Lex may be placing on their relationship, but that Lana tends to ignore them. Kreuk recognizes that Lex is a big part of Lana's life, and that Lana tries to pay more attention to the good that Lex does and focus less on the darker aspects of his life. The friendship that Lana shares with Chloe was deeply damaged at the start of season three, so much so that not even Kreuk realized how badly until the episode \\"Truth\\". Lana is aware that Chloe still has romantic feelings for Clark, but their friendship suffered the most when Chloe revealed that she had known where Clark had been hiding for months. The feelings of distrust for Chloe remained hidden until \\"Truth\\"—where Chloe gained the ability to have others speak the truth no matter what—when Lana finally revealed how much she cannot trust Chloe. This developing friendship between Lex and Lana puts a strain on Lana's relationship with Clark. Just as Clark is beginning to realize the truth about Lex and his lies, Lana is starting to trust Lex more. Ultimately, it is Clark's own lack of honesty that forces Lana to leave Smallville and go to Paris at the end of season three. In the end, Kreuk believes that Clark is Lana's only true friend, as Lex is more focused on bringing his father to justice and she and Chloe have a tense relationship based on their mutual feelings for Clark. While in Paris, Lana begins a new romantic relationship with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, but she also still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the \\"first love\\" that she never had the chance to discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know what it is like to truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the \\"intense connection between [the] two\\".Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp. 116-119 Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: \\"There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty […] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them.\\" Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is going to have to be honest with her. The beginning of season five saw, for the first time, Clark and Lana in a happy relationship together, one that was void of dishonesty and secrets. The return of Clark's powers in \\"Hidden\\", as well as the secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In \\"Hypnotic\\", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship \\"turned into much more\\". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because \\"she knows she will never really love him.\\" Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life has been motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in \\"Void\\", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Although she did not truly love Lex, Kreuk argues that Lex was not a rebound guy and that Lana did have feelings for him.\\" Even though Lana eventually marries Lex in season six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced her in that direction and she ended up getting in over her head.Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 116-119 By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and that she did not make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good. Reception In 2001, Kristin Kreuk was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress, as well as Female Cinescape Genre Face of the Future. The following year, alongside co-star Tom Welling, Kreuk was nominated for a Best Actress Saturn Award again. She would receive two more nominations in that category, one in 2004 and one in 2006, before she departed from the show. In the 2003 Teen Choice Awards, Kristin Kreuk was nominated for Choice TV Actress: Drama/Action Adventure. She was nominated again in 2004, 2006, 2008 for the revised category Choice TV Actress: Action Adventure, and finally in 2009. Kreuk was also co-nominated with Welling at the 2006 Teen Choice Awards for Most Beautiful Couple (TV - Choice Chemistry). DVD Verdict's Brian Byun felt that the casting of the series was \\"pitch-perfect\\"; noting that Kreuk is \\"painfully luminous\\" as Lana Lang, which makes it obvious why she is the object of Clark's obsession. Other media appearances Young adult novels Lana makes her first literary appearance in Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. In Strange Visitors, Lana attempts to organize a fund raiser for the family of a school mate, Stewart, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her effort is rendered moot when Lex Luthor and Dr. Donald Jacobi, a con artist that comes to Smallville, pick up Stewart's medical bills after a meteor rock removes all of the malignant cancer cells in his brain. In Smallville: Dragon, Lana visits an antiques dealer, Mrs. Mayfern, looking for a gift for her boyfriend, Whitney. When she leaves she breaks up with Whitney and starts dating Clark. It is eventually discovered that she was hypnotized by Mrs. Mayfern, whose homegrown herbal tea is fertilized by meteor rocks. Comic books Lana made a non-speaking cameo appearance in the ninth issue of the show's comic book continuation Smallville: Season Eleven, written by executive story editor Bryan Q. Miller. Though Clark and Bart Allen do not notice her, she watches them race over the coast of Cameroon.Smallville Season 11 vol. 1 #9 (January 2013) Lana returns in a parallel storyarc Valkyrie, in which she uses the superhero alias \\"Angel of the Plateau\\" and battles terrorists in Africa. Lana also saves Lois from one of their attacks. Lana reveals that she has been using her abilities to help and protect children from people who would exploit them after Lana had settled in Africa. However, Lois tries not to reveal her relationship with Clark to Lana. Elsewhere, the terrorists seek John Corben's aid in defeating Angel of the Plateau. Corben's new kryptonite heart (installed by Winslow Schott) has absorbed the nanites embedded in Lana's skin, rendering her powerless and no longer emitting the kryptonite radiation once more. After Lois helps Lana defeat Corben, Lana reveals that she had seen Lois's engagement ring, thus she already knows about Clark's relationship with Lois. Lana gives her blessing to Lois, and decides to remain in Africa as the Angel.Smallville Season 11 Specials #2 (June (2013) See also *Lana Lang -- The DC Comics version of the character References Category:Superman in other media Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional cheerleaders Category:Smallville characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2001 Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional stalking victims ","title":"Lana Lang (Smallville)"},{"id":"17716604","text":"One September Afternoon is a 1980 jazz album by saxophonist Art Pepper playing with Stanley Cowell, Howard Roberts, Cecil McBee and Carl Burnett.

In 1989, a novel class of autoantibodies was detected in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which were directed against a protein with an estimated molecular mass of 33 kDa in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells.Hassfeld et al.: Demonstration of a new antinuclear antibody (anti-RA33) that is highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis & Rheumatism 1989 ; 32:1515-20. The antigen was therefore named RA33. Protein sequencing of highly purified RA33 revealed that it was identical to hetergoneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRPA2B1).Steiner et al.: Purification and partial sequencing of the nuclear autoantigen RA33 shows that it is indistinguishable from the A2 protein of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex. Journal of Clinical Investigation 1992 ; 90:1061-66 Nowadays, the name anti-RA33 defines autoantibodies that are directed against hnRNP A2 and its splice variant hnRNP B1. Anti-RA33 occur in approximately 15-35% of patients with RA, in 20-25% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and in 35-40% of patients with mixed connective tissue disease, being rare or absent in other forms of arthritis.Steiner et al.: Autoantibodies to the A/B proteins of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex: Novel tools for the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. International Archives of Allergology and Immunology 1996;111:314-19. Anti-RA33 antibodies can be easily detected by immunoblotting employing crude nuclear extracts or the recombinant antigen. ELISA can also be employed which has been found to be less sensitive than immunoblotting. The pathogenic role of anti-RA33 antibodies is not fully understood. Anti-RA33 antibodies and T cells directed against RA33 might contribute to autoimmunity and inflammation by immune complex formation or by virtue of secretion of cytokines that may initiate and drive the pathogenic process.Fritsch et al.: Characterization of autoreactive T cells to the autoantigens RA33 (hnRNP A2) and filaggrin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Journal of Immunology 2002 169:1068-76 Of note, anti-RA33 are detectable already in the earliest disease stage of RA or even years before the onset of actual clinical disease. However, anti-RA33 antibodies are not associated with significant bone erosions or disease activity. In the absence of rheumatoid factor and anti- citrullinated protein antibody they are associated with a milder disease in RA.

The Strait of Gibraltar as seen from space (North is to the left: Spain is on the left and Africa on the right) Cetacea in the strait Comprising 189.1 square kilometres, it was declared a natural park in 2003. The park is located at the southernmost point of mainland Spain, and of mainland Europe, making it the southernmost park of Europe. The location at the point where the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea meet in the Strait of Gibraltar places it on the migratory route for many birds. Description Estrecho Natural Park is located on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula and protects the area of the coast from the Bay of Getares (Algeciras) to Cape Grace (Tarifa). It was declared a nature reserve in the year 2003 and is a protected area of 18,910 hectares. It is the most southerly protected area of the European continent and unites ecological, scenic, historical and cultural themes. It is part of the Transcontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean since it was designated in 2006. The east coast of the park is on the Mediterranean Sea and west coast is on the Atlantic Ocean. The Strait of Gibraltar, which links these seas and separates Europe from Africa, is a stopping point for migratory birds and marine mammals. The distance between the two continents is only 14 km and from prehistoric times this step is also a transit path for humans. The union of two oceans makes unique marine environment that houses an exceptional biodiversity of extraordinary interest. The climate of the area is characterized by mild temperatures and a dry season and a total lack of rain. Like all parks in Andalusia, El Estrecho Natural Park has a management board and an advisory body to the Governing Board. Since its creation, the conservative director of the park is Jesus Cabello Medina, forest engineer, who has enjoyed a career in the Ministry of Environment. The Governing Board is chaired by Sena Ildefonso Rodríguez, journalist and professor, re-elected in February 2008 for his second term. Geology The park is located in the foothills of the Betic Cordillera, part of the geological unit of Algeciras which extends to the north of Morocco. Algeciras unit consists of Margo Flychs Arenic-mica of the Oligocene – early Miocene, postorogenic land are located in the west of the park and are unique to the Quaternary, are mainly alluvial deposits. The main geological formations of the park are the mountains of The Hub and The Kid, with respect to coastal formations include karst submarine. Hydrology In eastern and due to the high slopes of the mountains of the hub there is no river wide entity, although several small rivers and runoff, among these rivers stands the river Guadalmesi and Marchenilla river valleys that form; in the west the ground is lower and there are located the Jara River and the de la Vega that are wetlands at its mouth. Flora and fauna Within the park you can find different ecosystems, each with its flora characteristic, the Mediterranean scrub is the most abundant, contains species such as palms, heather, mastic, erguen, matagallo and other xerophytic species, forests are mainly cork alternating in some areas with introduced pine species in the riparian or canutos predominantly Andalusian gall along the rhododendron or hornbeams and numerous species of ferns. As for the fauna include birds that make their migration from Africa to Europe in numbers of tens of thousands. There are an abundance of large mammals themselves are in the nearby Parque Natural de los Alcornocales due to rough terrain and predominantly creeping vegetation type, thus it can be found mongoose, genets and other small mammals. Regarding the flora and fauna have been found underwater meadows of angiosperms in several areas of the park but due to the wing of the waves are not high concentrations. The marine fauna is exceptionally narrow, numerous species of cetaceans whales, dolphins, orcas, sperm whales, blue whales, etc. History The earliest evidence of human journey through these lands are the remains of Neanderthals found in the Rock of Gibraltar. That may correspond to one of the world's last populations of this group of people. Additionally, there are remains of the earliest modern humans in the area, from the Lower Paleolithic. There are about 34 known caves and shelters with rock art and funerary structures and dolmens different representative periods from the Palaeolithic to the Cueva del Moro to the Bronze Age of the Tombs of the Algarbes with veranda megalithic burials. Later, the territory was populated by many of the civilizations in the area. Within the park boundaries are sites like Cala Arenas, Carthaginians, Romans and Claudia Baelo or medieval as the Hill Campus of the Gallows or the Castle of Tarifa. Under the waters of the park are many wrecks, mostly from the modern age.

History  The process of colonization of the region, now occupied by the city of João Pinheiro began probably in the half of the 18th century, the period preceding the discovery of gold mines in the regions with the movement of inputs and flags bearing the lands of Paracatu. Prior to occupancy by the white man, the territory was inhabited only by Amerinds (the tribe of Cataguá) and fugitive blacks of Paracatu and Goiás mines By 1818, near the banks of the Vereda Extreme came a small town founded by pioneers and drovers who sought the captaincy of Goiás, this was the first landing of the white man in these parts. However, some of these adventurers settled animated by livestock and the diamond mines in the Rio Santo Antônio. It was a fever and this became the main activity of the camp nascent. The town was named Santana Cheerful, this was the first name of the primitive camp belonging to the bishopric of Pernambuco - which gave the municipality current. According to oral tradition, a very brave Curraleiro ox that lived in the vicinity of the site, often in the evening, went to the camp and remained there throughout the night mooing. The habit of that animal, called Alegre, intrigued everyone. It is said that this was the reason for the name of settlement. In 1873, the village of Santana Merry was elevated to district (in land of Paracatu). Until 1902, the mining has been extensively explored by the river Santo Antônio bed and other waterways. On August 30, 1911, Santana Cheerful, received its current name, and went dismembered Paracatu. In 1925 you were granted fora-city and seat of municipality. The city has a few parties of tradition, as is the case of the Cowboy Festival, held in April, the off-season carnival, João Pirô, held in October and Party City, held in September.

Feist and Janny Wurts. It is the third and final book in the Empire Trilogy and was published in 1992. It was preceded by Servant of the Empire, which was published in 1990. Plot introduction After rising to power, Mara of the Acoma must now face the power of the brotherhood of assassins, the spies of rival houses, and the might of the Assembly, who see her as a threat to their power. Plot summary In the last novel of the series, Mara's actions in the first two books come back to haunt her. Although revered by the general population as the Servant of the Empire, her enemies plot revenge. Mara's son and heir Ayaki is killed by the Hamoi Tong in an attempt on Mara's life. Although the tong is known for preserving the secrecy of its employers, a token of the Anasati house is found in the assassin's hiding place. With her heart set on vengeance, Mara, as leader of Clan Hadama, calls for war with Clan Ionani, of which the Anasati, led by Lord Jiro, are a member. The Assembly of Magicians, \\"Great Ones\\" tasked with protecting the Empire, forbid the war, claiming the conflict would tear the Empire apart. Two years later, an assassin of the Hamoi Tong poses as a Midkemian trader and poisons Mara with a chocolate drink. Mara's Spy Master Arakasi ruthlessly tortures the apothecary who sold the poison in order to find an antidote, and her husband Hokanu, although ambushed by assassins, manages to survive and return with the recipe. Mara survives, but her unborn child dies, and it is discovered that Mara will be able to bear only one more child. As she recovers, Arakasi is given the task of destroying the Hamoi Tong by stealing its records. Mara gives birth to Hokanu's daughter, who is named Kasuma, but Hokanu's reluctance to accept a girl as his heir damages the intimate connection between him and Mara. Arakasi infiltrates the tong, killing its leader and stealing the records. On delivery, it is discovered that the death of Hokanu's father, Kamatsu, had been paid for by Jiro. Mara realizes that the Great Ones forbade the war against the Anasati as a result of a centuries-long policy of keeping Tsurani culture in stagnation, as well as a fear that she will be responsible for a radical upheaval in society. Hoping to find a way to resist the Assembly, Mara commits her children to the protection of the Emperor and journeys to the heart of the Thuril Highlands and Chakaha, the city of the cho-ja, where she convinces the cho-ja to aid her. Two cho-ja magespowerful creatures whose presence in the Empire is forbidden under the terms of an ancient treaty between the Tsurani cho-ja and the Assemblyreturn with her to her estates, where she immediately learns that the Emperor Ichindar has been assassinated and that all the Houses of the Empire are mobilizing for war. Mara quickly realizes that her enemies, the Anasati foremost among them, seek to claim the Emperor's Golden Throne and that it is Jiro's intention to marry the late Emperor's daughter, Jehilia. Mara's children, trapped in the Imperial City of Kentosani, represent major threats to anyone who wishes to take the throne; in particular, because of her adoption into the Imperial Family in Servant of the Empire, Mara's twelve-year-old son, Justin, is Ichindar's closest living male relative. Allies of the Anasati are situated within immediate range of Kentosani, and although the Acoma army is able to block reinforcements, neither Mara, Hokanu, or Jiro can initiate the conflict without incurring the wrath of the Assembly. Fighting breaks out amongst other Houses, but without the involvement of the Acoma, Shinzawai, or Anasati, no definite conclusion can be reached. Mara and Jiro are summoned to Kentosani by the Assembly; Jiro, who is several days closer, orders his allies to attack the city once he is inside, while Mara devises a way to disrupt his plans. She takes ten guards and makes her way toward Kentosani, while her oldest advisers and a large honour guard provide a distraction on the main roads. At the same time, she commands her army to attack the Anasati army, and though the Acoma are the larger force the battle is interrupted by the Great Ones, who force a withdrawal and, after questioning her Force Commander, begin to suspect her alliance with the cho-ja. They set out to find her, but in an expensive sacrifice the decoy force succeed in taunting a hot-headed Great One into destroying them all, allowing her time to avoid an Anasati ambush and enter a cho-ja hive. Hokanu launches a mounted attack on Jiro's own honor guard, who prove ill-prepared to fight against men on horseback. Hokanu strangles Jiro, then proceeds toward Kentosani. The Great Ones, angered by Mara's new alliance, inadvertently break their treaty with the cho-ja in an attempt to kill her, and the cho-ja mages are able to transport her to the Imperial City. A marriage is hastily arranged between Justin and Jehilia, which takes place as the Great Ones try to breach wards set by the cho-ja. Justin's coronation is completed just as the Great Ones are about to break through, but, faced with a new emperor who holds the support of the temples (and the Gods), they are forced to accept Mara as Regent as well as the introduction of a new social order. The series ends with a reunion between Mara and Kevin of Zūn, who returns to Tsuranuanni as an ambassador from The Kingdom of the Isles, unknowing that he has fathered a child, and shocked to find his son upon the Imperial Throne. Kevin and Mara, who has divorced Hokanu, quickly resume their romance. Arakasi, Mara's Spymaster, is focused upon more in this novel: he falls in love whilst infiltrating the Hamoi Tong, and his struggle to reconcile his emotions and his profession form a running subplot.

Plot introduction In the world of Kelewan, Mara of the Acoma has now become an expert player in the Game of the Council through bloody political maneuvering. After buying a group of Midkemian prisoners-of- war, she finds one of them—Kevin of Zūn—to be a great asset in her ongoing struggle for survival and power. Plot summary Having risen in wealth, power and social standing but still threatened by powerful enemies, Lady Mara of the Acoma is in as much danger as ever after her triumphs in Daughter of the Empire. Lord Desio of the Minwanabi, son of the defeated Lord Jingu, swears an unbreakable blood oath to the Red God of Death that he will destroy the Acoma or end his own bloodline. He enlists into this cause his cousin Tasaio, the cruel military genius who had managed to send Mara's father and brother to their deaths without breaking any laws or losing honor. Though challenging the norms of Tsurani society had served her well, Mara remains a product of her culture and does not question many of her beliefs and conventions. Through the eyes of her Midkemian slave Kevin of Zūn, she begins to see the flaws, contradictions, limitations and potential of the Tsurani Empire—and finds Kevin, a love like she has never known. The Minwanabi plot to kill the Acoma military commander Keyoke and then force Mara into a campaign in the faraway desert lands of Dustari. Thanks to Mara's cho-ja warriors and Kevin's innovative \\"barbarian\\" tactics, Mara and her ally the Lord of the Xacatecas manage to overcome a Minwanabi ambush and secure an unprecedented treaty with the desert chiefs of Dustari. Tasaio is exiled for his failure against Mara, but ascends to Lord of the Minwanabi after Desio's death in battle on the barbarian world of Midkemia. Mara barely survives an extended overnight attack orchestrated by Tasaio and a second attack sent by powerful members of the Omechan clan who seek the office of Warlord in the Imperial capital of Kentosani. Mara continues acquiring allies and favors toward an endgame she knows is unavoidable. Her hopes of freeing Kevin from slavery are dashed by a proclamation from the Emperor Ichindar forbidding such practice, and soon she is even forced to relinquish Kevin for an Imperial exchange of prisoners with the Barbarian King. However, Mara manages to influence Ichindar and manipulate the High Council to thwart Tasaio's ambitions and destroy the Minwanabi once and for all. Mara—pregnant with Kevin's child—is named Servant of the Empire.

Plot introduction In the world of Kelewan, Mara of the Acoma must lead her followers through terror and peril while surviving the ruthless Game of the Council. Mara must plot, bend tradition, avoid assassination attempts and trade her heart for power in order to save the Acoma from destruction.  Plot summary  At the age of 17, Mara's ceremonial pledge of servantship to the goddess Lashima is interrupted by the news that her father and brother have been killed in battle. Now Ruling Lady of the Acoma, Mara finds that not only are her family's longtime enemies, the powerful Minwanabi, responsible for the deaths of her loved ones, but her military forces have been decimated by the Minwanabi betrayal and House Acoma is vulnerable to utter destruction. An immediate assassination attempt thwarted, Mara relies on the loyalty and advice of her military commanders Keyoke and Papewaio, her former nurse Nacoya, and her own wits to find solutions that will stave off the enemies who would see her ruined. Mara bends tradition to suit her needs by contriving a way to recruit grey warriors — the former soldiers of fallen Houses, traditionally outcast — to bolster the ranks of her army. Among them is the Spy Master Arakasi, whose network of informants had failed to save his former Lord from destruction at the hands of the Minwanabi, but remains intact and at his disposal. Mara makes an alliance with the Queen of a new colony of cho-ja, an insectoid species comprising both fierce warriors and gifted artisans, improving both her military might and potential wealth from cho-ja exports. Mara also arranges a political marriage with her family's second most powerful enemy, the Anasati. Given a choice between the second and third Anasati sons, she makes the surprising choice of Buntokapi, the third son, generally regarded as incompetent and brutish. After their marriage, Buntokapi reveals himself to be a strong military leader and much smarter than others have given him credit for, but also proves to be both an abusive husband and a somewhat inept ruling lord. Mara becomes pregnant with an heir, securing her alliance with the Anasati, and sets in motion the rest of her plan; falling prey to her machinations, Buntokapi finds himself forced to commit ritual suicide to save his honor. Finally, facing Lord Jingu of the Minwanabi himself on his own estates at a celebration attended by the many noble families of Kelewan, Mara avoids assassination and turns the tables to contrive Jingu's own \\"honorable\\" suicide, avenging her father and brother.

It was discovered by Jun O'Hara, who demonstrated that the energy blows up as the knot's strands get close to one another. This is a useful property because it prevents self-intersection and ensures the result under gradient descent is of the same knot type. Invariance of Möbius energy under Möbius transformations was demonstrated by Michael Freedman, Zheng-Xu He, and Zhenghan Wang (1994) who used it to show the existence of a C^{1,1} energy minimizer in each isotopy class of a prime knot. They also showed the minimum energy of any knot conformation is achieved by a round circle. Conjecturally, there is no energy minimizer for composite knots. Robert B. Kusner and John M. Sullivan have done computer experiments with a discretized version of the Möbius energy and concluded that there should be no energy minimizer for the knot sum of two trefoils (although this is not a proof). Recall that the Möbius transformations of the 3-sphere S^3=\\\\mathbf R^3\\\\cup\\\\infty are the ten-dimensional group of angle-preserving diffeomorphisms generated by inversion in 2-spheres. For example, the inversion in the sphere \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf v\\\\in\\\\mathbf R^3\\\\colon \\\\mathbf v-\\\\mathbf a=\\\\rho\\\\\\\\} is defined by \\\\mathbf x\\\\to\\\\mathbf a+{\\\\rho^2\\\\over \\\\mathbf x-\\\\mathbf a^2}\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf x-\\\\mathbf a). Consider a rectifiable simple curve \\\\gamma(u) in the Euclidean 3-space \\\\mathbf R^3, where u belongs to \\\\mathbf R^1 or S^1. Define its energy by :E(\\\\gamma)=\\\\iint\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma(u)-\\\\gamma(v)^2}- \\\\frac{1} {D(\\\\gamma(u),\\\\gamma(v))^2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}(u)\\\\dot{ \\\\gamma}(v)\\\\,du\\\\,dv, where D(\\\\gamma(u),\\\\gamma(v)) is the shortest arc distance between \\\\gamma(u) and \\\\gamma(v) on the curve. The second term of the integrand is called a regularization. It is easy to see that E(\\\\gamma) is independent of parametrization and is unchanged if \\\\gamma is changed by a similarity of \\\\mathbf R^3. Moreover, the energy of any line is 0, the energy of any circle is 4. In fact, let us use the arc-length parameterization. Denote by \\\\ell the length of the curve \\\\gamma. Then :E(\\\\gamma)=\\\\int_{-\\\\ell/2}^{\\\\ell/2}{}dx\\\\int_{x-\\\\ell/2}^{x+\\\\ell/2}\\\\left[{1\\\\over\\\\gamma(x)-\\\\gamma(y)^2}-{1\\\\overx-y^2}\\\\right]dy. Let \\\\gamma_0(t)=(\\\\cos t, \\\\sin t, 0) denote a unit circle. We have : \\\\gamma_0(x)-\\\\gamma_0(y)^2={\\\\left(2\\\\sin\\\\tfrac12(x-y)\\\\right)^2} and consequently, :\\\\begin{align} E(\\\\gamma_0)&=\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi}{}dx\\\\int_{x-\\\\pi}^{x+\\\\pi}\\\\left[{1\\\\over \\\\left(2\\\\sin\\\\tfrac12(x-y)\\\\right)^2}-{1\\\\overx-y^2}\\\\right]dy\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=4\\\\pi\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi}\\\\left[{1\\\\over \\\\left(2\\\\sin( y/2)\\\\right)^2}-{1\\\\overy^2}\\\\right]dy\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=2\\\\pi\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi/2}\\\\left[{1\\\\over \\\\sin^2y}-{1\\\\overy^2}\\\\right]dy\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=2\\\\pi\\\\left[{1\\\\over u}-\\\\cot u\\\\right]_{u=0}^{\\\\pi/2}=4 \\\\end{align} since \\\\frac1u-\\\\cot u=\\\\frac u3-\\\\cdots. Knot invariant A knot is created by beginning with a one-dimensional line segment, wrapping it around itself arbitrarily, and then fusing its two free ends together to form a closed loop (, ). Mathematically, we can say a knot K is an injective and continuous function K\\\\colon[0,1]\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^3 with K(0)=K(1). Topologists consider knots and other entanglements such as links and braids to be equivalent if the knot can be pushed about smoothly, without intersecting itself, to coincide with another knot. The idea of knot equivalence is to give a precise definition of when two knots should be considered the same even when positioned quite differently in space. A mathematical definition is that two knots K_1,K_2 are equivalent if there is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism h\\\\colon\\\\R^3\\\\to\\\\R^3 with h(K_1)=K_2, and this is known to be equivalent to existence of ambient isotopy. The basic problem of knot theory, the recognition problem, is determining the equivalence of two knots. Algorithms exist to solve this problem, with the first given by Wolfgang Haken in the late 1960s . Nonetheless, these algorithms can be extremely time-consuming, and a major issue in the theory is to understand how hard this problem really is . The special case of recognizing the unknot, called the unknotting problem, is of particular interest . We shall picture a knot by a smooth curve rather than by a polygon. A knot will be represented by a planar diagram. The singularities of the planar diagram will be called crossing points and the regions into which it subdivides the plane regions of the diagram. At each crossing point, two of the four corners will be dotted to indicate which branch through the crossing point is to be thought of as one passing under the other. We number any one region at random, but shall fix the numbers of all remaining regions such that whenever we cross the curve from right to left we must pass from region number k to the region number k+1. Clearly, at any crossing point c, there are two opposite corners of the same number k and two opposite corners of the numbers k-1 and k+1, respectively. The number k is referred as the index of c. The crossing points are distinguished by two types: the right handed and the left handed, according to which branch through the point passes under or behind the other. At any crossing point of index k two dotted corners are of numbers k and k+1, respectively, two undotted ones of numbers k-1 and k+1. The index of any corner of any region of index k is one element of \\\\\\\\{k\\\\pm1,k\\\\\\\\}. We wish to distinguish one type of knot from another by knot invariants. There is one invariant which is quite simple. It is Alexander polynomial \\\\Delta_K(t) with integer coefficient. The Alexander polynomial is symmetric with degree n: \\\\Delta_K(t^{-1})t^{n-1} = \\\\Delta_K(t) for all knots K of n>0 crossing points. For example, the invariant \\\\Delta_K(t) of an unknotted curve is 1, of an trefoil knot is t^2-t+1. Image:Trefoil knot left.svgThe left handed trefoil knot. Image:TrefoilKnot_01.svgThe right handed trefoil knot. Let :\\\\omega(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=\\\\frac1{4\\\\pi}\\\\varepsilon_{ijk}{x^idx^j\\\\wedge dx^k\\\\over\\\\boldsymbol{x}^3} denote the standard surface element of S^2. We have :\\\\mathrm {link}(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2)=\\\\int_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\in\\\\gamma_1,\\\\boldsymbol{y}\\\\in\\\\gamma_2}\\\\omega(\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{y}) :\\\\int_{S^2}\\\\omega(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=\\\\frac1{4\\\\pi}\\\\int_{S^2}\\\\varepsilon_{ijk}x^idx^j dx^k=1,\\\\qquad \\\\omega(\\\\lambda\\\\boldsymbol{x})= \\\\omega(\\\\boldsymbol{x}){\\\\rm {sign}}\\\\lambda, \\\\quad{\\\\rm { for} }\\\\quad\\\\lambda \\\\in\\\\R^*.

Möbius Invariance Property Let \\\\gamma be a closed curve in \\\\mathbf R^3 and T a Möbius transformation of S^3=\\\\mathbf R^3\\\\cup\\\\infty. If T(\\\\gamma) is contained in \\\\mathbf R^3 then E(T(\\\\gamma))=E(\\\\gamma). If T(\\\\gamma) passes through \\\\infty then E(T(\\\\gamma))=E(\\\\gamma)-4. Theorem A. Among all rectifiable loops \\\\gamma\\\\colon\\\\ S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbf R^3, round circles have the least energy E (\\\\mathrm{ round} \\\\mathrm{ circle})=4 and any \\\\gamma of least energy parameterizes a round circle. Proof of Theorem A. Let T be a Möbius transformation sending a point of \\\\gamma to infinity. The energy E(T(\\\\gamma))\\\\ge0 with equality holding iff T(\\\\gamma) is a straight line. Apply the Möbius invariance property we complete the proof. Proof of Möbius Invariance Property. It is sufficient to consider how I, an inversion in a sphere, transforms energy. Let u be the arc length parameter of a rectifiable closed curve \\\\gamma, u\\\\in\\\\mathbf R/\\\\ell\\\\mathbf Z. Let :E_\\\\varepsilon(\\\\gamma)=\\\\iint_{u-v\\\\ge\\\\varepsilon}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{ \\\\gamma(u)-\\\\gamma(v)^2}-\\\\frac{1}{D(\\\\gamma(u),\\\\gamma(v))^2}\\\\right)\\\\,du\\\\,dv\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad(1) and :\\\\begin{align} E_\\\\varepsilon(I\\\\circ\\\\gamma)=&\\\\iint_{u-v\\\\ge\\\\varepsilon} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{I\\\\circ\\\\gamma(u)-I\\\\circ\\\\gamma(v)^2} -\\\\frac{1}{(D(I\\\\circ\\\\gamma(u),I\\\\circ\\\\gamma(v)))^2}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad\\\\times\\\\I'(\\\\gamma(u))\\\\\\\\cdot\\\\I'(\\\\gamma(v))\\\\\\\\,du \\\\,dv.\\\\end{align}\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad(2) Clearly, E(\\\\gamma)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to0}E_\\\\varepsilon(\\\\gamma) and E(I\\\\circ\\\\gamma)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to0}E_\\\\varepsilon(I\\\\circ\\\\gamma). It is a short calculation (using the law of cosines) that the first terms transform correctly, i.e., :\\\\frac{\\\\I'(\\\\gamma(u))\\\\\\\\cdot\\\\I'(\\\\gamma(v))\\\\}{I( \\\\gamma(u))-I(\\\\gamma(v))^2}= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma(u)-\\\\gamma(v)^2}.

Freedman–He–Wang conjecture The Freedman–He–Wang conjecture (1994) stated that the Möbius energy of nontrivial links in \\\\mathbb R^3 is minimized by the stereographic projection of the standard Hopf link. This was proved in 2012 by Ian Agol, Fernando C. Marques and André Neves, by using Almgren–Pitts min-max theory . Let \\\\gamma_i: S^1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R^3, i=1,2, be a link of 2 components, i.e., a pair of rectifiable closed curves in Euclidean three-space with \\\\gamma_1(S^1) \\\\cap \\\\gamma_2(S^1) = \\\\emptyset. The Möbius cross energy of the link (\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) is defined to be : E(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) = \\\\int_{S^1 \\\\times S^1} \\\\frac{\\\\dot\\\\gamma_1(s)\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2(t)}{\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t)^2}\\\\, ds\\\\, dt. The linking number of (\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) is defined by letting :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm {link}(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) &=\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi} \\\\oint_{\\\\gamma_1}\\\\oint_{\\\\gamma_2} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\\\mathbf{r}_2}{\\\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\\\mathbf{r}_2^3} \\\\cdot (d\\\\mathbf{r}_1 \\\\times d\\\\mathbf{r}_2)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int_{S^1 \\\\times S^1} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm {det}(\\\\dot\\\\gamma_1(s),\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2(t),\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t))}{\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t)^3}\\\\, ds \\\\, dt.\\\\end{align} { border=0 cellpadding=5 align=\\"center\\" -valign=\\"center\\" \\\\cdots align=\\"center\\"140px align=\\"center\\"140px align=\\"center\\"140px  -valign=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\"linking number −2 align=\\"center\\"linking number −1 align=\\"center\\"linking number 0  -valign=\\"center\\"  align=\\"center\\"140px align=\\"center\\"140px align=\\"center\\"140px \\\\cdots -valign=\\"center\\"  align=\\"center\\"linking number 1 align=\\"center\\"linking number 2 align=\\"center\\"linking number 3 } It is not difficult to check that E(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2)\\\\geq 4\\\\pi {\\\\rm link}(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2). If two circles are very far from each other, the cross energy can be made arbitrarily small. If the linking number \\\\mathrm {link}(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) is non-zero, the link is called non-split and for the non-split link, E(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2)\\\\geq 4\\\\pi . So we are interested in the minimal energy of non-split links. Note that the definition of the energy extends to any 2-component link in \\\\mathbb R^n . The Möbius energy has the remarkable property of being invariant under conformal transformations of \\\\mathbb R^3. This property is explained as follows. Let F:\\\\mathbb R^3 \\\\rightarrow {S^3} denote a conformal map. Then E(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) = E(F\\\\circ \\\\gamma_1,F\\\\circ \\\\gamma_2). This condition is called the conformal invariance property of the Möbius cross energy. Main Theorem. Let \\\\gamma_i: S^1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R^3, i=1,2, be a non-split link of 2 components link. Then E(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) \\\\geq 2\\\\pi^2. Moreover, if E(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) = 2\\\\pi^2 then there exists a conformal map F:\\\\mathbb R^3 \\\\rightarrow {S^3} such that F\\\\circ \\\\gamma_1(t)=(\\\\cos t,\\\\sin t,0,0) and F\\\\circ \\\\gamma_2(t)=(0,0,\\\\cos t,\\\\sin t) (the standard Hopf link up to orientation and reparameterization). Given two non-intersecting differentiable curves \\\\gamma_1, \\\\gamma_2 \\\\colon S^1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3, define the Gauss map \\\\Gamma from the torus to the sphere by :\\\\Gamma(s,t) = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1(s) - \\\\gamma_2(t)}{\\\\gamma_1(s) - \\\\gamma_2(t)}. The Gauss map of a link (\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2) in \\\\mathbf R^4, denoted by g=G(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2), is the Lipschitz map g:S^1 \\\\times S^1 \\\\to S^3 defined by g(s,t) = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t)}{\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t)}. We denote an open ball in \\\\mathbf R^4, centered at \\\\mathbf x with radius r, by B^4_r(\\\\mathbf x). The boundary of this ball is denoted by S^3_r(\\\\mathbf x). An intrinsic open ball of S^3, centered at \\\\mathbf p\\\\in S^3 with radius r, is denoted by B_r(\\\\mathbf p). We have :\\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial s}= {\\\\dot \\\\gamma_1-\\\\langle g,\\\\dot\\\\gamma_1\\\\rangle g \\\\over \\\\gamma_1-\\\\gamma_2}\\\\quad\\\\mbox{and}\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial t}= -{\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2-\\\\langle g,\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2\\\\rangle g\\\\over\\\\gamma_1-\\\\gamma_2}. Thus, :\\\\begin{align}\\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial s}\\\\right^2 \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right^2-\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial s}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle^2 &\\\\leq \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial s}\\\\right^2 \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{\\\\dot \\\\gamma_1^2-\\\\langle g,\\\\dot \\\\gamma_1\\\\rangle^2}{\\\\gamma_1-\\\\gamma_2^2}\\\\frac{\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2^2-\\\\langle g,\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2\\\\rangle^2}{\\\\gamma_1-\\\\gamma_2^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\dot \\\\gamma_1^2\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2^2}{\\\\gamma_1-\\\\gamma_2^4}. \\\\end{align} It follows that for almost every (s,t)\\\\in S^1\\\\times S^1, {\\\\rm Jac\\\\, }g(s,t)\\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\dot \\\\gamma_1(s)\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2(t)}{\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t)^2}. If equality holds at (s,t), then \\\\langle \\\\dot \\\\gamma_1(s),\\\\dot\\\\gamma_2(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\dot \\\\gamma_1(s),\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle \\\\dot\\\\gamma_2(t),\\\\gamma_1(s)-\\\\gamma_2(t) \\\\rangle=0. {\\\\mathbf M}(C) \\\\leq \\\\int_{S^1\\\\times S^1} {\\\\rm Jac\\\\, }g\\\\,ds\\\\,dt\\\\leq E(\\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2).

He is a former Commonwealth and WBO Inter-Continental super featherweight champion. Boxing career Hailing from Willenhall ABC in Willenhall, Coventry Pithie won the 1994 ABA featherweight title. Highlights in his amateur career included defeating future world champion Prince Naseem Hamed. He represented England in the 57kg division, at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Pithie turned professional in February 1995 at the Tryst Sports Centre, Cumbernauld, Scotland. In his debut Pithie defeated Doncaster's Colin McAuley with a third round knockout and knocked out McAuley again in his second fight. Dean Pithie won 12 of his next 13 fights, drawing the other with Kelton McKenzie. He avenged this draw in his next fight. This brought his record to 15-0-1 (7 KO). He fought Steffy Bull in his next fight for the WBO Intercontinental Championship, disposing of Bull by the way of TKO. Pithie made one defence of his title before being beaten by Gary Thornhill to record his first professional defeat. Pithie managed to put himself back into contention for minor belts with two successive wins after this defeat, and earned at shot at Andrew Matabola for his WBC international title. However Pithie was defeated by way of 8th Round TKO. Pithie claimed the WBC International title in his next fight however, avenging his loss at the hands of Matabola by 2nd round TKO. Pithie was rated alongside the best featherweights in the country, and was tipped in some circles for British, European, and possibly world honours eventually. After 2 defences, Pithie fought Michael Gomez for the British Super Featherweight title, losing on points. After a draw with Jim Wiseman at Skydome, Coventry, Dean fought a Frenchman by the name of Afif Djelti for the IBO super featherweight world title. Pithie was knocked out in 6 rounds. Pithie went on to win the Commonwealth title, defeating Liverpudlian Alex Moon in front of a capacity crowd in his hometown of Coventry, Pithie called on former Coventry boxer Steve Earlyto train him for the bout which was live on Sky Sports. This was to be a career highpoint. Pithie came out punching in the 12th round just like the first. Pithie only managed to hold the bout for one defence, a reign which would be co-terminus with the end of his career, losing his final fight to Glaswegian Craig Docherty. Pithie's Final Record was 25 won, 5 lost, 2 draw. Personal life Pithie lives in Coventry.

Like other Eastern European institutions of its kind, it was both a high school and a higher learning institute, housing several faculties. History Academia Mihăileană's founder is intellectual Gheorghe Asachi, who obtained the permission and support of the ruling Prince Mihail Sturdza. It derived its Mihăileană name from the monarch's first name (literally: \\"Michaelian Academy\\"). Sturdza issued the official decision which authorized the founding of the Academy in 1834. Because the institution was not assigned a building of its own, courses began at the Vasilian Gymnasium, a school founded by the same Asachi in 1828. On June 6, 1835, the academy had its official inauguration on separate premises, with the participation of Prince Sturdza. A dedication liturgy was held in the nearby Talpalari Church, which thenceforth served as the academy's chapel. Although Academia Mihăileană no longer provided faculty courses after 1847, it was not legally abolished, and temporarily suspended its activity (during a time of political turmoil caused by the frequent Ottoman–Russian clashes on Moldavia's soil, and the periods of Russian occupation). In 1860, Alexandru Ioan Cuza (Domnitor of the Principality of Moldavia) decided to disestablish the institution and split its patrimony. Its faculties were set up as a nucleus for the newly established University of Iaşi, while the inferior courses were re-created as the National High-School Iași (where studies lasted 7 years). Many of the academy’s professors continued their activity within the University. Organisation Academia Mihăileană was organized in three faculties, of Law, Philosophy and Theology, following the model of its predecessor, the Princely Academy from Iaşi (1707–1821), where Asachi had been a teacher of Applied Sciences and Engineering from 1813 to 1819. The program of study in the faculties of Philosophy and Theology lasted two years, while the Faculty of Law took three years. In order to be admitted into the Faculty of Law, one had to first graduate from Philosophy. The Academy delivered certificates of study, but not specific academic degrees. Like present-day graduates of the French École Normale Supérieure, students who completed courses at Academia Mihăileană only received a certificate that gave them the right to work in the service of the state, in administration, justice or education. Due to the quality of the study programs and to the qualification of the professors (most of them had a PhD from Austrian or Hungarian universities and were members of various academic associations), the Western universities readily recognized the Academy's study certificates. Their possessors could enlist directly in a doctoral program, similar to graduates of any Western university in the period.

Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is as a practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the smoker of the cigar. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale. Although far rarer than their prank cousins, exploding cigars used as a means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the United States Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960s to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Notable real- life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar. Manufacture and decline Exploding cigar comic from July 8, 1919 edition of the Oakland Tribune by Fontaine Fox. The largest manufacturer and purveyor of exploding cigars in the United States during the middle of the 20th century was the S. S. Adams Company, which, according to The Saturday Evening Post, made more exploding cigars and other gag novelty items as of 1946 than its next eleven competitors combined. The company was founded by Soren Sorensen Adams, dubbed \\"king of the professional pranksters\\", who invented and patented many common gag novelties such as sneezing powder, itching powder, the dribble glass and the joy buzzer.The New York Times Company (October 21, 1963). Obituaries section: Soren S. Adams, 84, Novelties Maker (Associated Press). Retrieved on June 9, 2008. The largest New York–based manufacturer of exploding cigars was Richard Appel, a German refugee from Nuremberg, who in or about 1940 opened a gag novelty factory on Manhattan's Lower East Side.CondéNet (2008). Abstract of the March 30, 1940 issue of The New Yorker, p. 13: Gagman by Maurice Zolotow. Retrieved on June 10, 2008. By the time exploding cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety had fallen out of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 in the aftermath of a death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end. However, the decline in the use and advertisement of the exploding cigar was neither complete, nor permanent, and they can be obtained worldwide. In the United States, makers include Don Osvaldo and Hawkins Joke Shop. However, their availability in the USA is limited, as some states, such as Massachusetts, have banned their sale entirely. Prank exploding cigars have caused many injuries over their history. For example, in 1902 one Edward Weinschreider sued a cigar shop for an exploding cigar which burned his hand so badly three of his fingers had to be amputated.Brooklyn Daily Eagle (October 22, 1902). Front page: Loaded Cigar Damage Suit. Digitized version available through the Brooklynpubliclibrary.org . Retrieved on June 9, 2008. As has been observed by one legal scholar, \\"[t]he utility of the exploding cigar is so low and the risk of injury so high as to warrant a conclusion that the cigar is defective and should not have been marketed at all.\\"Steenson, Michael K. A Comparative Analysis of Minnesota Products Liability Law and the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability. 24 William Mitchell Law Review 1 (1998) Laws have been enacted banning the sale of exploding cigars entirely, such as Chapter 178 of Massachusetts' Acts and Resolves, passed by its legislature in 1967. In fiction Both prank and intentionally deadly exploding cigars have been featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows to be of the prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar. Film examples include Cecil B. DeMille's 1921 romance Fool's Paradise, wherein the main character is blinded by an exploding cigar; Laurel and Hardy's Great Guns (1941), which features a gag in which tobacco is replaced by gunpowder; in Road To Morocco (1942) with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope features the duo mixing gunpowder with tobacco in order to create chaos and escape a desert sheik with their girls; the Elke Sommer vehicle, Deadlier Than the Male (1967), where a murder by exploding cigar is a key plot element; in The Beatles' 1968 animated feature film, Yellow Submarine, where an exploding cigar is used to rebuff a psychedelic boxing monster; the 1984 comedy Top Secret!, in which Omar Sharif's British secret agent character is pranked with an exploding cigar by a blindman; and in the 2005 film V for Vendetta, where the main antagonist's cigar is swapped with an exploding one during a comedy skit. Appearance of exploding cigars in the Warner Bros. cartoon franchises, Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes was fairly common, often coupled with the explosion resulting in the pranked character appearing in blackface. Some examples include: Bacall to Arms (1942), wherein an animated Humphrey Bogart gets zapped by an exploding cigar leaving him in blackface, 1949's Mississippi Hare, where the character, 'Colonel Shuffle' likewise ends up in blackface after the explosion, 1952's Rabbit's Kin, in which Pete Puma offers Bugs Bunny an exploding cigar (true to form, Bugs Bunny turns the tables on the hapless feline, placing the cigar in Pete's mouth after he is dazed and lighting it with expected results), and 1964's Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare, where the Tasmanian Devil successfully gets Bugs Bunny to smoke an exploding cigar. Other media examples include television appearances such as when Peter Falk's Columbo must solve an industrial magnate's death by exploding cigar in the episode \\"Short Fuse\\" (1972), in a season four episode of the United States television, CBS crime drama, CSI: NY titled \\"Child's Play\\", wherein the forensic team investigate the death of a man killed by an exploding cigar, and in a 1966 episode of The Avengers entitled \\"A Touch of Brimstone\\"; in video games such as Day of the Tentacle where hoagie can offer George Washington an exploding cigar; and as a stock device by the Joker in Batman comic books. For example, in Batman #251 (1973) entitled The Joker's Five-Way Revenge, an exploding cigar containing nitro-glycerin is used by the Joker to kill one of the members of his gang. In reality Ulysses S. Grant's delayed gift According to a 1932 Associated Press story, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant gave Horace Norton, the founder of a defunct college in Chicago, an exploding cigar soon after being introduced to him, but the \\"joke\\" wasn't revealed until many years later. According to the story, unaware of the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was shutting its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted. The tale of \\"Grant's cigar\\" has unquestionably been embellished over time. The possibility exists that the tale is a hoax or urban legend or that the cigar was tampered with by someone after Grant's purported presentation. Ernest Hemingway Reportedly, Ernest Hemingway, urged on by a group of journalists with whom he was drinking at the Palace Hotel bar in Rapallo, Italy, presented an exploding cigar to one of four bodyguards of Turkish general İsmet İnönü. When the cigar \\"went off\\", all four guards drew their guns and aimed at Hemingway. He apparently escaped without any grievous bodily injury. CIA plot to assassinate Castro Mad Magazine. Written by Al Jaffee and painted by Norman Mingo In the late 1950s under Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential administration and in the early 1960s under John F. Kennedy's, the CIA had been brainstorming and implementing plots to assassinate Fidel Castro, going as far as enlisting the help of American Mafia leaders such as Johnny Roselli and Santo Trafficante, Jr. to assist in carrying out their plans. Many assassination ideas were floated by the CIA in the covert operation which was dubbed \\"Operation Mongoose.\\" The most infamous was the CIA's alleged plot to capitalize on Castro's well known love of cigars by slipping into his supply a very real and lethal \\"exploding cigar.\\" A November 4, 1967 Saturday Evening Post article reported that during Castro's visit to the United Nations in 1966 a CIA agent approached New York City police chief inspector Michael J. Murphy with a plan to get Castro to smoke an exploding cigar. While numerous sources state the exploding cigar plot as fact, at least one source asserts it to be simply a myth, and another, mere supermarket tabloid fodder. Another suggests that the story does have its origins in the CIA, but that it was never seriously proposed by them as a plot. Rather, the plot was made up by the CIA as an intentionally \\"silly\\" idea to feed to those questioning them about their plans for Castro, in order to deflect scrutiny from more serious areas of inquiry. Whether true or not, the CIA's exploding cigar assassination plot inspired the cover of the October 1963 issue (#82) of Mad Magazine. Conceived by Al Jaffee, the cover (pictured at right) bears the headline, \\"You'll Get a BANG out of this issue of Mad Magazine\\", and features a painting by Norman Mingo depicting Castro in the act of lighting a cigar wrapped with a cigar band on which is drawn Alfred E. Neuman with his fingers plugging his ears, awaiting the explosion.October 1963 Mad Magazine Cover . Retrieved on June 4, 2008. An exploding cigar is also featured on the poster for the Channel 4 British Documentary, 638 Ways to Kill Castro, which shows Castro with a cigar in his mouth that has a fuse projecting from the end and a lit match approaching. An exploding cigar was tested on a season 2 episode of Deadliest Warrior, KGB vs. CIA. The cigar completely destroyed the upper and lower jaw of a gel head but was determined to be very unreliable due to its timed fuse and small explosive payload.
