Its programming format consists primarily of news, talk and sports. The station is licensed to Cumulus Media. The station is also audible on translator K255DJ 98.9 FM in Columbia. History KFRU was founded in Bristow, Oklahoma by E.H. Rollestone, in January 1925. That fall, the station was purchased by Stephens College and moved to Columbia (with Rollestone going on to found KVOO-AM, now KFAQ).Tulsa Radio: KVOO-AM On September 24, 1935, the Federal Communications Commission approved transfer of the station from Nelson R. Darragh, of St. Louis, to Luther L. Hill, of Des Moines. Several owners later, the station was purchased by the St. Louis Star-Times newspaper, mostly for its regional broadcast frequency of 630 kHz, later moved to its St. Louis radio station, KXOK. In 1940, KFRU became an affiliate of the Blue Network. The station was assigned its current 1400 kHz frequency in 1941. Mahlon Aldridge, Jr. was appointed manager in 1945, purchasing the station in 1948 in partnership with the publisher of the Columbia Daily Tribune. In 1957, the station's format consisted of a mixture of country music, news and sports. Aldridge sold his interest to his partner's son in the 1980s, and competition caused the station's audience share to fall. After another change in ownership, KFRU was purchased by a local ownership group headed by Al Germond, who moved the studios into the broadcast complex with their KARO-FM (now KPLA) station. The group formed and purchased additional stations in the Columbia and Jefferson City markets under the name of Premier Marketing Group. In 2004, KFRU and the other Premier Marketing Group stations were sold to Cumulus Broadcasting. In August 2017, KFRU applied for an FM translator at 98.9 as part of the FCC's AM revitalization project. The translator signed on for the first time on August 18, 2019. Network affiliations=ABC Radio Network When KFRU was purchased by the Star-Times, it became affiliated with the NBC Blue Network, now the ABC Radio Network,. KFRU switched to the Westwood One/CNN news feed in 2012. After Westwood One ended their newsfeed, KFRU returned to ABC News Radio on August 31, 2020. Missouri Tiger Network KFRU was the longtime flagship station of play-by-play broadcasts of Missouri Tiger football and basketball teams. On December 22, 2009, Mizzou Sports Properties (owned by Learfield Sports) announced it would move Tiger broadcasts to Zimmer Radio's mid-Missouri cluster, fronted by 99,000-watt KCMQ, starting in 2010. With KMOX-AM in St. Louis as a network affiliate, the network has had many regional and national broadcasters providing play-by-play and color commentary for MU sports broadcasts, including: *Jack Buck (member of the Baseball and Radio Hall of Fame) *Harry Caray (member of the Baseball Hall of Fame) *Bob Starr *Bob Costas (NBC Sports) *Kevin Harlan (CBS Sports) *Tom Dore (Chicago Bulls) *Joe Buck (Fox Sports) *John Rooney (Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals) *Bill Wilkerson *Kellen Winslow (Fox Sports Net) (member of the College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame) *Dan Kelly (member of the Hockey Hall of Fame) *Jon Sundvold *Kevin Calabro Former color commentators include Jim Kennedy and Rod Kelly. The current broadcast teams through the 2011-12 season are: *Football - Mike Kelly (play-by-play), Howard Richards (color commentary) and Chris Gervino (sideline) *Men's Basketball - Mike Kelly (play-by-play) and Gary Link (color commentary) *Women's Basketball - David Lile or Will Palaszczuk (play-by-play) and Gary Link or Michael Porter (color commentary) St. Louis Cardinals Baseball Network As of the 2012 Major League Baseball season, the station is no longer a St. Louis Cardinals radio network affiliate; Zimmer Radio's KSSZ replaced KFRU as the Columbia market affiliate. According to previous years' KFRU promotional advertisements, they had been affiliated with the Cardinals for at least 60 years. Awards *Peabody Award for Public Service by a Small Station, 1940 *Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism, presented to Mahlon Aldridge *KFRU awarded the Missouri Broadcasters Association 2015 Station of the Year award. This was the first ever Station of the Year award given by the MBA. *KFRU inducted into the Boone County Historical Society's Hall of Fame, October 8, 2015, just days after the station's 90th Anniversary. Affiliation with the University of Missouri School of Journalism Prior to the founding of University-owned station KBIA-FM in 1971, KFRU was a primary training ground for broadcast journalism students at the University. Even after this time, the station still employs students and recent graduates; many graduates list the station on their current employment biography pages.

Based on a French design, it was developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory, and built by six different British companies including Daimler, Rolls-Royce and Wolseley Motors Limited. Design and development The RAF 1 was based on the Renault 70/80 hp engine, being intended specifically to replace that engine in the B.E.2c. It featured larger cylinders () for a total displacement of 540 cubic inches (8.8 L). It was rated at 92 hp (70 kW) at 1,600 rpm. The heads were cast integrally with the cylinders, with the intake and exhaust valves set one above the other in an upside-down F-head configuration. The engines featured a large diameter lightweight flywheel at the rear, enclosed in a cast housing. Engine oil was picked up from the bottom of the crankcase and slung into a reservoir at the top. From there it was gravity fed, via a gallery high on the right side of the engine block, to the main bearing caps, and then to the connecting rod journals by centrifugal effect of the turning crankshaft. The main bearings were ball bearings and were splash fed. Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 reduction gearbox at the front. This drove the four- bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed. Excess engine oil from the flywheel overflowed the reservoir and trickled over the large surface area of the round flywheel cover. Two passages cast into the cover took air-fuel mixture from the carburettor mounted at the bottom to a copper U-shaped inlet manifold mounted between the banks of cylinders, and the flywheel cover acted as a heat exchanger, preheating the fuel-air mixture. In late 1915, the bore was increased to , leading to an increased displacement of 590 cubic inches (9.7 L) and power of 86 kW (115 hp) at 1,800 rpm. Lumsden 2003, p. 223. Supercharger In late 1915 a supercharged experimental version of the RAF 1a was developed, the engine being flown in a B.E.2c improving the climb from taking 36 minutes to reach 8,500 ft without the supercharger, to reaching 11,500 ft in the same time.http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/aircraft/50719-increasing-charge-2.html Variants RAF 1 RAF 1a (standard engine for aircraft using this powerplant) RAF 1b (uprated version slated for installation in the B.E.2e - reliability problems precluded production)Hare (1990) p. 115 RAF 1c RAF 1e Applications List from Lumsden *Airco DH.6 *Armstrong Whitworth F.K.2 *Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3 *Boulton Paul P.6 *Boulton Paul P.9 *de Havilland DH.51 (prototype) *Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 *Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9 (For a brief period following WWI examples were fitted to several privately owned aircraft due to the engine's cheapness and comparative fuel economy - one was even found in a privately owned S.E.5a).

Kuykendall also served as professor of history at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He is most noted as a historian of the Hawaiian Islands, South Pacific, and Pacific Northwest. Early life Kuykendall was born in Linden, California. His parents Reverend John Wesley Kuykendall and Marilla Persis Pierce were both Methodist missionaries and descendants of Dutch settlers from New York. In 1919 Kuykendall married Edith Clare Kelly from Hollister, California. They had two sons, John Richard Kuykendall and Delman Leur Kuykendall. Kuykendall attended California‚Äôs College of the Pacific where he was active in campus life as a debater, editor of the college newspaper, and student body president. He graduated in 1910 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Following his graduation from 1911 to 1912, Kuykendall taught at College Park Academy and started his graduate studies in history at Stanford University. After a year of study, Kuykendall took a break and moved to Florida to work with his brother at a newspaper. In 1916 Kuykendall returned to California to work as a field research agent for the California Historical Survey Commission. He apparently succeeded at collecting and assessing the material he obtained in the field and compiling his results into cohesive works. Kuykendall had resumed his post-graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1919 Kuykendall completed his M.A. thesis entitled History of Early California Journalism. He had intended to complete his doctorate when he was again awarded the Native Sons of the Golden West fellowship to do research in the Archives of Seville, Spain. While in Spain, Kuykendall was tapped to be the executive secretary of the newly established Hawaiian Historical Commission. He left Spain in 1922. Professional life Ralph Kuykendall arrived in Honolulu, Hawaii on June 19, 1922. As executive secretary of the Hawaiian Historical Commission, Kuykendall was expected to research and complete three historical works. The first was a school textbook on Hawaiian history. The second was a history on Hawaii‚Äôs role in World War I. And the third was a comprehensive and authoritative history of the Hawaiian people. Kuykendall mostly relied upon the historical collections at the Territorial Archives, the Library of Hawaii and other museums. Earlier histories were written from the perspectives of the missionaries, or the missionaries, or traders and foreign governments. Kuykendall wanted to incorporate all of these perspectives Kuykendall's first book, A History of Hawaii, was approved by the Hawaii State Legislature in 1925. It co-authored with the help of Dr. Herbert E. Gregory who served as the Director of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. A History of Hawaii documents the early beginnings of the Hawaiian kingdom to United States territory. The year 1926 marked its first use in Hawaii classrooms. The second book, titled Hawaii in the World War, was co-authored with Lorin Tarr Gill. Published in 1928, Hawaii in the World War details the territory's military and domestic involvement in the war. The final, third book, an accurate history of the Hawaiian people, was by far the most difficult to complete. The work was to be a narrative history divided into three sections; 1) ancient history prior to 1778, 2) Hawaiian monarchy from 1778 through the overthrow of 1893, 3) the transition from provisional government to republic to territory. Kuykendall drew largely from the archives of Washington D.C., the Oregon Historical Society, British Columbia, Harvard College Library, Washington State archives, the Mormon archives in Salt Lake City, Bancroft Library, and the California State Library. He also acquired new collections of documents, newspapers, periodicals, books, and manuscripts. In 1923 Kuykendall accepted a position as history professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa. Kuykendall continued to serve as the executive secretary of the Hawaiian Historical Commission until its dissolution in 1932. He published a few more books, including the trilogy The Hawaiian Kingdom. Volume 1: Foundation and Transformation, 1778-1854, published 1938 is about the formation of the Hawaiian Islands under a single kingdom and the development of the Hawaiian nation. The book spans the first half of the Kamehameha Dynasty; Kamehameha I, Kamehameha II, Kamehameha III. Volume 2: Twenty Critical Years, 1854-1874, published 1953, is about the ‚Äúmiddle period‚Äù after the establishment of the Kingdom. It is about international relations, immigration, changing economics and society. Kuykendall described this period as ‚Äúneglected‚Äù by academics. The book spans the last half of the Kamehameha Dynasty; Kamehameha IV, Kamehameha V, and Lunalilo and his brief dynasty. Volume 3: The Kalakaua Dynastism, 1874-1893, published 1967, is about the decline of the Kingdom, Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, and eventual overthrow. The book spans the KalƒÅkaua Dynasty; KalƒÅkaua, Lili ªuokalani. Volume 3 was one of Kuykendall‚Ä≤s posthumous publications. Also, in 1948, Ralph Kuykendall and A. Grove Day published Hawaii: A History From Polynesian Kingdom to American Statehood. Kuykendall was diagnosed with cancer in the early 1960s and he moved to Tucson, Arizona to live with his son. Kuykendall continued to work up until his death in 1963; he left several unfinished manuscripts. The University of Hawaii at Manoa named the building in which the English Department resides after Kuykendall. Bibliography for Ralph S. Kuykendall 1919 History of Early California Journalism.

Development Early in 2000, HIT started design work on a new 4√ó4 internal security (IS) vehicle called the Mohafiz. This was first shown in mid-November 2000 and in December 2000 started extensive trials. Engine It is powered by a 4.2 litre diesel engine coupled to a manual transmission with five forward and one reverse gears and a two speed transfer case. If required, a more powerful 4.5 litre diesel engine could be installed to provide a higher power-to-weight ratio. Although the first example of the Mohafiz is based on a Toyota Land Cruiser chassis, it could also be built on other 4 √ó 4 chassis. This includes the Land Rover Defender 110 (4 √ó 4), which is already in service with the Pakistan Army in large numbers. Vehicles supplied to Iraq were based on a Land Rover 110 (4 √ó 4) chassis. Design The Mohafiz APC has an all- welded aluminium armour body that provides the occupants with protection from small arms fire up to 7.62 mm in calibre and shell splinters. The fully enclosed engine compartment is at the front with the crew compartment extending to the rear. The commander and driver are seated at the front and provided with bulletproof windows to their front and a forward opening door with a bulletproof window in the upper part of either side. These bulletproof windows are covered by wire mesh screens. The bulletproof windows provide the same level of protection as the armoured hull. The troop compartment is at the rear with the troops seated on either side on bench seats and enter the vehicle via a large door in the rear opening to the right. Bulletproof windows are provided in the sides and rear of the troop compartment. A total of ten firing ports are provided to allow rifles and other small arms to be used from within the vehicle. The upper parts of the hull slope slightly inwards as does the hull rear. Mounted on the forward part of the roof is a manually operated one person turret armed with a 7.62 mm machine gun and/or a tear gas grenade launcher and a two part roof hatch which opens left and right. Vehicles delivered to Iraq are fitted with a one-person turret armed with a 7.62 mm PK machine gun. To the immediate rear of the turret are two forward opening roof hatches although the design of the vehicle is flexible so that various types of roof hatch arrangement are possible.

Administratively, it is a comune of the Italian province of Imperia. The main economic activities are horticulture and tourism. The town is notable for claims of independence from Italy as the sovereign Principality of Seborga. Economy Seborga is known in the region for its agricultural activity: in particular, cultivation and collection of olives and floriculture crops. Thanks to Seborga's publicity as a principality, tourism has expanded in recent years. The principality's historic town centre was also restored, ensuring that its charms were protected from commercial overdevelopment. Culture An important cultural event in Seborga is the annual festival of Saint Bernard, the town's patron saint, held on August 20. Seborga's twin city is L'Escar√®ne, France. The festival includes a procession of citizens and the carrying of a statue of Saint Bernard. Transport Seborga is situated along Provincial Road 57 in Imperia. The nearest motorway access is at the Bordighera exit on the A10. The nearest railway station is also the one in Bordighera, on the Ventimiglia-Genoa line. Principality of Seborga In the early 1960s, Giorgio Carbone, then head of the local flower-growers co- operative, began promoting the idea that Seborga retained its historic independence as a principality. By 1963 the people of Seborga were sufficiently convinced of these arguments to elect Carbone as their ostensible head of state. He then assumed the self-styled title Giorgio I, Prince of Seborga, which he claimed thereafter.\\"Prince of Seborga fights on for 362 subjects\\" , Italy Magazine, 15 June 2006 Carbone's status as prince (although without any legal power) was further supported by locals on 23 April 1995, when, in an informal referendum, Seborgans voted 304 in favour, 4 against, for the principality's constitution, and in favour of independence from Italy.\\"Noel Gallagher is my choice for monarch\\", Caitlin Moran, The Times, 30 January 2006 The prince was known locally as Sua Tremendit√† ('His Tremendousness').\\"Battle rages for His Tremendousness's throne\\", Malcolm Moore, Daily Telegraph, 13 June 2006 The national anthem of Seborga, titled \\"The Hope\\", was composed by Carbone himself and set to music by Maestro Luigi Poggi of Bordighera in 1994.http://www.principatodiseborga.com/pds/bandiera- stemma-inno Prince Giorgio Carbone reigned until his death at the age of 73. He died on 25 November 2009.Obituary: 'His Tremendousness Giorgio Carbone', Daily Telegraph, 27 November 2009. The following year the Principality held its first election for a new Prince. There were five proposals, of whom two, Marcello Menegatto and Gian Luigi Morgia, were nominated by council as candidates. Elections were held on 24 and 25 April 2010. Out of a total of 220 eligible voters, 89 voted for Menegatto and 67 voted for Morgia, making Menegatto the new Prince of Seborga. 31 year old Menegatto was crowned Prince in a ceremony held on 22 May 2010. After his victory against Mark Dezzani in the 2017 elections, Menegatto gained seven more years on the throne of Seborga, but abdicated in 2019 and was succeeded by his ex-wife Nina Menegatto, who won the 2019 elections against Laura Di Bisceglie and became the first Princess in Seborga's history. The Republic of Italy and international institutions consider and treat Seborga as an integral part of the territory of Italy. Law enforcement, public health, telecommunications, school services and all other public services are provided as in the rest of Italy. Seborgans regularly pay taxes, participate in the Italian administrative life, and vote in local and national (Italian) elections. For instance, in the elections of the Senate in 2001 the voter turnout was 84.21%.

Three species are known growing naturally in southern Africa, including two species endemic to South Africa and one species in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. One species A. salicifolia, which grows in Australia, has a wider distribution through nearby Timor and westwards through some more of the Lesser Sunda Islands (Indonesia). This species has the widest distribution of all and is the type species‚Äîthe first to have a formal scientific name, description and represent the genus. In biodiversity‚Äìrich New Guinea , many areas do not have complete formal scientific botanical survey. In this context, science seems to have only recorded the knowledge of A. papuana growing there naturally as the putative sole endemic species. Regionally widespread A. salicifolia does not seem to have scientific records from New Guinea even though science has recorded it many times in the regions of northern Australia and Timor nearest to southern and western New Guinea. Biogeography, habitats and conservation In mainland Australia's warmer places, twelve species are known by published formal botanical descriptions‚Äîtrees, shrubs and subshrubs, growing naturally in rainforests, brigalow scrubs, monsoon forests (rainforests in a climate of a summer wet season and cool dry season, with drought‚Äìdeciduous trees), tropical savannas, coastal scrubs, some arid desert areas and in similar vegetation associations further south than the tropics. Certain species particularly occur in Australia's restricted areas of naturally high nutrient soil types, for instances, soils built from limestone or basalt parent materials. Areas of more fertile soils than average Australian soils, have not surprisingly had their native vegetation associations preferentially destroyed for converting the soils to European‚ÄìAustralian agricultural methods. This has disproportionately brought about the decline of the specialised native plants of these soils. Two Australian species found in Queensland have herbarium specimen collections and published informal descriptions, but are awaiting formal publication of scientific descriptions and names. Collectively, the fourteen known Australian species range throughout warmer parts of the continent, including parts of the semi-arid and arid zones, in Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, New South Wales and South Australia, except for Tasmania and Victoria where they have not been recorded. Some Australian species have very reduced, scarce or isolated known ranges and natural habitats, . Atalaya collina Yarwun Whitewood trees, have a known range of only two very isolated populations to the west of Gladstone, Queensland, hence this species' populations have a national conservation status listing of \\"endangered\\" in the Australian government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC). Ian D. Cowie, Glenn M. Wightman and Benjamin Stuckey formally scientifically named and described the restricted endemic, unique, Atalaya brevialata subshrub species, in their recently published, Dec 2012, scientific paper. Botanists have found this species growing naturally only in a restricted area of the Darwin region of Australia. In their formal scientific description Cowie, Wightman and Stuckey have published the species global conservation status (IUCN) of \\"endangered\\" under the following criteria \\"IUCN B1, 2ab (i, ii, iii, iv, v)\\". A. brevialata plants have the unusual and unique nature among Atalaya species of a suffruticose growing habit; meaning, in this case, a species which has evolved from an ancestral group of woody‚Äìtrunked shrubs or trees into having woody growth only underground and above ground only leafy growth. They grow naturally only up to tall subshrubs, with the leafy above ground growth that dies back each dry season to the underground woody rootstocks. In South Africa three species grow naturally. The scarcity of A. natalensis trees and their restricted range has received the global conservation status (IUCN) of \\"vulnerable D2\\". A. capensis has a global conservation status (IUCN) listing also, of \\"Lower Risk / conservation dependent\\" . In Papua New Guinea A. papuana grows naturally in coast monsoon dune scrub (coastal rainforests on dune soils that become seasonally dry, with deciduous trees), tropical savanna forests and in regenerating areas of regularly burning swamp forests and rainforests. Naming and classification European science formally named and described the genus Atalaya in 1847, authored by Carl L. Blume, with the Timor type specimen of the species Atalaya salicifolia. Two species were formally described in 1965 by Pieter W. Leenhouts in preparations for treatment of the family Sapindaceae in Flora Malesiana. In 1981, 1985 and 1991, Sally T. Reynolds scientifically described several new Australian species in two scientific journal articles and in her writing of the Atalaya section of the Flora of Australia (series). Species Australian species information was sourced from the authoritative Australian Plant Name Index and Australian Plant Census, the Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants information system, Fruits of the Australian Tropical Rainforest, scientific journal papers, the Flora of New South Wales, and the Flora of Australia. Regarding taxa in New Guinea, Malesia and Africa only few information sources were found, such as the Census of Vascular Plants of Papua New Guinea, Flora Malesiana, and the South African National Biodiversity Institute web sites and the IUCN, respectively, thus for these lands this list may be incomplete. *Atalaya alata ‚Äì KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique *Atalaya angustifolia ‚Äì Queensland, Australia *Atalaya australiana ‚Äì Queensland, Australia *Atalaya brevialata ‚Äì Northern Territory endemic, Australia *Atalaya calcicola ‚Äì Queensland, Australia *Atalaya capensis ‚Äì South Africa endemic *Atalaya collina ‚Äì Queensland, Australia *Atalaya hemiglauca ‚Äì WA, SA, Qld, NSW, NT, Australia *Atalaya multiflora ‚Äì Qld, NSW, Australia *Atalaya natalensis ‚Äì South Africa endemic ‚Äì Globally Vulnerable *Atalaya oligoclada ‚Äì Queensland, Australia *Atalaya papuana ‚Äì SE New Guinea *Atalaya rigida ‚Äì Queensland, Australia *Atalaya salicifolia ‚Äì WA, NT, Qld, NSW, Australia; Timor, Sumbawa, Sumba, Leti, Malesia *Atalaya sericopetala ‚Äì Queensland, Australia *Atalaya variifolia ‚Äì WA, NT, Qld, Australia ;Species provisionally named, described and accepted according to the authoritative Australian Plant Name Index while awaiting formal publication *Atalaya sp.

Politics=Mayor and City Council Coonerty and State Attorney General gathered for a press conference at police headquarters on March 15, 2011 In 2004 and again in 2008, Coonerty was elected to four-year terms on the Santa Cruz City Council, finishing first in a field of 10 candidates in 2008. Coonerty additionally served as mayor twice during his time on the city council, in 2008 and 2011. As part of his responsibilities as mayor, Coonerty served as the lead city negotiator in an agreement with the University of California Santa Cruz related to their Long Range Development Plan. The agreement ended half a dozen lawsuits. The agreement was adopted unanimously by the City Council, County Board of Supervisors, and a citizen group. For this effort, he was profiled as a Santa Cruz Sentinel Newsmaker of the Year in 2008. He also coauthored the Clean Oceans, Rivers and Beaches initiative which passed as an initiative in the November 2008 election. He served a second one-year term as mayor in 2011. During his term, he worked to balance the city budget, launch the Mayor's Academy, and appoint a Technology Task Force to improve the use of technology by the city. As a result of this effort, Code for America selected Santa Cruz as one of its six partner cities for 2012. He additionally played a key role in 2012 in recruiting the NBA G-League Santa Cruz Warriors to Santa Cruz. Some of Coonerty's efforts have received national attention, including the creation of an Ayuda Linea (Help Line) for day laborers to report incidents of abuse, and a policy to invest part of the City's reserve funds in local financial institutions, an effort praised by the National Center for Local Sustainability. Coonerty also founded Santa Cruz NEXT, a non-partisan organization dedicated to engaging the next generation of Santa Cruz in the civic life of the community. In 2008, he was selected \\"as one of the nation‚Äôs most promising young leaders\\" to be a Rodel Fellow in Public Leadership at the Aspen Institute. Board of Supervisors Coonerty was elected to the Board of Supervisor in 2014 and 2018, capturing 76% and 78% of the vote respectively. In February 2015, Coonerty and fellow supervisor Bruce McPherson wrote new regulations designed to incentivize small and affordable housing by requiring construction projects to pay higher fees into a fund providing grants for affordable housing as well as more funding for childcare facilities. In June 2015, Coonerty wrote a letter subsequently approved by the Board of Supervisors requesting the county withdraw investments from banks that have pleaded guilty to committing felonies, an initiative that won praise from Robert Reich. Coonerty led the effort to establish a local Nurse-Family Partnership Program and a Thrive by Three Fund to support families' health and educational outcomes. During his time as supervisor, Coonerty has led the expansion of the Community Partnership for Accountability, Connection and Treatment (PACT), a collaborative anti-crime project between government and nonprofits that focuses on improving outcomes for repeat offenders. In 2015, PACT was awarded the National Association of Counties Achievement Award for excellence in public safety.

Pseudoproline (also pseudo-proline, œà-Pro) derivatives are artificially created dipeptides to minimize aggregation during Fmoc solid- phase synthesis of peptides. History The chemical synthesis of large peptides is still limited by problems of low solvation during solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) or limited solubility of fully protected peptide fragments: even chemoselective ligation methods are hampered by self- association of unprotected peptide blocks. The elucidation of the relationship between preferred conformation of a growing peptide chain and its physicochemical properties reveals that Œ≤-sheet (beta-sheet) formation is often paralleled by significant decrease in solvation and solubility.Mutter, M., Vuilleumier, S., Angew.

M., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1998) 120, p.2714 have been reported to modify the intrinsic properties of peptides responsible for aggregation and secondary structure formation. Pseudoprolines consist of serine- (Oxa) or threonine-derived oxazolidines [Oxa(5-Me)] and Cysteine-derived thiazolidines (THz) with Proline-like ring structure (see top right). Mutter and coworkersMutter, M., Nafzi. A., Sato. T., Sun, X., Wahl. E, W√∂hr,T. Peplide Res. (1995) 8. 145. have defined oxa- and thiaproline derivatives of serine, threonine, and cysteine with Ser(œàPro). Thr(œàPro), and Cys(œàPro), respectively, where the abbreviation œàPro indicates the relationship to proline (with heteroatomic ring substitution in position 4). Pseudoprolines with substitution in position 2 of the proline ring are named Ser/Thr/Cys-(œàR1,R2 Pro). Due to the preference for a cis-amide bondNefzi. A., Schenk K., Mutter. M . Protein Pept Lett. (1994) 1, p.66 with the preceding residue of C2-substituted pseudoprolines, their incorporation results in a kink conformation of the peptide backbone, thus preventing peptide aggregation, self-association, or Œ≤-structure formation. Strategies for the use of Pseudoproline in Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). Hence, pseudoprolines fulfill two functions simultaneously: they serve (1) as temporary side-chain protection for Ser, Thr, and Cys and (2) as solubilizing building blocks to increase solvation and coupling rates during peptide synthesis and in subsequent chain assembly. Pseudoprolines are obtained by reacting the free amino acids with aldehydes or ketone.F√ºlop F., Mattinen J., Pihlaja K., Tetrahedron (1990) 46, p.6545Kallen RG., J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1971) 93, p.6236 The coupling of amino acid derivatives to a growing peptide chain containing N-terminal pseudoproline generally results in low yields because of the sterically hindered nature of the oxazolidine (thiazolidine) ring system and the decreased nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom. Consequently, the preformation of suitably protected dipeptide derivatives of the type FMOC- Xaa1-Oxa/THz-OH is preferable for use in peptide synthesis. Two conceptually different approaches are feasible for preparing oxazolidine- and thiazolidine- ring-containing dipeptide derivatives: (1) the in situ acylation of Ser- or Thr-derived oxazolidines or Cys-derived thiazolidines using acid fluorides or N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA); and (2) the direct insertion of the oxazolidine systems into dipeptides (post-insertion) containing C-terminal Ser or Thr. The method of choice strongly depends on the nature of the pseudoproline as welI as on the substituents at C2 of the cyclic system. Advantages Conversion of pseudo-Pro (œàPro) residues. Pseudoprolines are a powerful tool for improving the quality of synthetic peptides.P. White, et al. (2004) J. Pept. Sci. 10, 18 Pseudoproline dipeptides have greatly increased the success rate for synthesizing both long and difficult peptides. Pseudoproline dipeptides can be introduced in the same manner as other amino acid derivatives. The routine use of pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides in the FMOC solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of serine- and threonine-containing peptides leads to remarkable improvements in quality and yield of crude products and helps avoid unnecessary repeat synthesis of failed sequences.Balbach J, Schmid FX. (2000). Proline isomerization and its catalysis in protein folding. In Mechanisms of Protein Folding 2nd ed. Editor RH Pain. Oxford University Press. Pseudoproline dipeptides have proven particularly effective in the synthesis of intractable peptides, long peptides/small proteins, and cyclic peptides, enabling in many cases the production of peptides that otherwise could not be made. These dipeptides are extremely easy to use: simply substitute a serine or threonine residue together with the preceding amino acid residue in the peptide sequence with the appropriate pseudoproline dipeptide (see the figure on your right). The native sequence is regenerated on cleavage and deprotection.T. Haack & M. Mutter (1992) Tetrahedron Lett. 33, 1589W.R.Sampson, et al. (1999) J. Pept. Sci. 5, 403P. White, et al.

More importantly, at the end of 2004, more than 600 peptides were either in development or advanced preclinical phases.Marx, V. Chem Eng News 2005, 83, 17-24 Improvements Scheme of part of the beta-sheet of the RANTES structure. Circled amino acids were incorporated as pseudo-Proline dipeptides. Traditionally, solid-phase synthesis has relied on polystyrene-based resins for the synthesis of all kinds of peptides. However, due to their high hydrophobicity, these resins have certain limitations, particularly in the synthesis of complex peptides, and in such cases, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based resins are often found to give superior results. Another powerful strategy for expediting the assembly of complex peptides is to employ pseudoproline dipeptides. These derivatives disrupt the interactions among chains that are usually the cause of poor coupling yields in aggregated sequences. A large arsenal of chemical tools is now available for the synthesis of almost all peptides up to 40 amino acid residues. However, several small-size peptides and many large peptides and/or proteins are still unavailable by classical methods. Composition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based resin. Recently, an efficient stepwise solid-phase synthesis of RANTES (24-91) was published. RANTES is a major HIV-suppressive factor produced by CD8+ T Cells.Cocchi F. et al., Science 270:1811-1815, 1995 The serine protease CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV) induces a NH2-terminal truncation from RANTES (1-91) to RANTES(24-91), which inhibits the infection of monocytes by an M-tropic HIV-1 strainProost P. et al., J Biol Chem, Vol. 273, Issue 13, 7222-7227, 1998 The 68 amino acid of RANTES(24-91) has a high propensity to aggregate.Nardesse, V.;Longhi, R.

They include Alice in the Cities (1974), The Wrong Move (1975), and Kings of the Road (1976). All three films were shot by cinematographer Robby M√ºller and mostly take place in West Germany. The centerpiece of the trilogy, The Wrong Move, was shot in colour whereas Alice in the Cities was in black and white 16 mm, and Kings of the Road was in black and white 35 mm film. Conception Director Wim Wenders didn't conceive of the three films as a trilogy, and they were first labelled as one by U.S. critic Richard Roud. However, U.S. filmmaker Michael Almereyda writes that \\"they are unified by shared themes, an exacting formal rigor, and the presence of R√ºdiger Vogler.\\" Almereyda remarks that Wenders' earliest feature films, Summer in the City and The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty, also involved \\"aimless journeys,\\" but the Road Movie trilogy was distinct as \\"travel not only propels the story but also absorbs and reshapes it.\\" The films were also made on small budgets but with great mobility.  Legacy  The three low-budget films established Wenders' and M√ºller's road movie style, a style that they later resurrected in bigger budget color films including Paris Texas and Until the End of the World. The trilogy also introduced (in Alice in the Cities) the fictitious wandering character Philip Winter who returns in three later Wenders films, Lisbon Story, Until the End of the World, and Faraway, So Close!. The style of aimless wandering in the Road Movie trilogy influenced other directors including American director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise) who worked with Wenders on The State of Things. The Road Movie trilogy established Wenders' prominence in international cinema and has attained minor cult film status among Wenders and M√ºller fans. A number of issues, such as rights issues concerning the soundtracks of the films, have made the three Road Movie films hard to find on video in the United States. However, in 2016 The Criterion Collection released the films on DVD and Blu-ray as Wim Wenders: The Road Trilogy.

Edison State Community College currently offers more than forty associate degreeshttp://www.edisonohio.edu/programs and short term technical certificates, a broad range of baccalaureate transfer programs, developmental coursework, and continuing education offerings designed to result in university transfer, career advancement, and workforce development.  History  left Edison State Community College was chartered in 1973 under provisions of the Ohio Revised Code as the first general and technical college in Ohio. The college thus emerged without special local taxation as a two-year, public, co-educational, state-supported institution of higher learning. Under its charter, it was authorized to offer studies in the arts and sciences, technical education and continuing education. By virtue of legislative action, the College's name was changed in 1978 from Edison State General and Technical College to Edison State Community College. Today, the College is known as Edison State Community College. From modest beginnings in a rented facility, the College has grown in stages to its current campus. Its enrollment and offerings have grown steadily during its brief forty-year history, from 309 students enrolled in 30 courses in 1973 to more than 3,000 students enrolled today. Edison State Community College currently offers five different degrees, two of which are designed for transferring to a four-year college or university, and three which prepare graduates for immediate employment. An additional campus was opened in Darke County in the spring of 1979 in response to Edison's commitment to providing quality education opportunities. Originally housed in a rented facility, the Wagner Avenue location was opened in 2001 and officially became the Darke County Campus to better reflect the range of student services and enrollment opportunities available to area residents.Darke County History.

A seventeenth-century engraving shows some images of what may be Standing Baba. More recently Khareshwari seem to stand inside. Author Gregory David Roberts places Babas inside in his description of Khareshwari in the novel Shantaram. Additionally, two online photos of Khareshwari both show men inside, not under a tree. The Standing Baba have a swing-like device that allows them to rest their arms during the day. During the night, a Khareshwari will support his torso on the swing as he sleeps. The swing usually has a sling beneath it. The sling can hold one of the Khareshwari's legs at a time. It is unclear if this is intended to rest one leg or to increase the pressure on the other leg. While Khareshwaris may walk about, they usually just stand/hang in their swing. Standing for years at a time causes swollen legs and ulcerated feet. Roberts and others describe the Khareshwari tapa as extremely painful and even permanently disabling.

They grow naturally in the New Guinea, the Moluccas, Sulawesi, Indonesia, Timor, Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Niue, Tonga, Palau (Caroline Islands) and the Philippines. The known centre of diversity of New Guinea has nine known species recognised by science . In Australia, they grow naturally through the northern half of the eastern coastal zone, northwards from the Newcastle region in New South Wales through eastern Queensland to the northernmost point of Australia Cape York Peninsula. One of them E. xylocarpa has a common name of white tamarind, while another E. nervosa has a common name of beetroot tree. A few members of the Australian Sapindaceae are called tamarinds, although they have no close relation to the true tamarind, which is a member of the bean family. Conservation At the global scale, several Elattostachys species have been threatened with extinction, as officially recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Three New Guinea endemic species E. aiyurensis, E. goropuensis and E. rubrofructus, one Sulawesi endemic species E. erythrocarpum and one New Caledonia endemic species E. dzumacensis have been vulnerable to global extinction according to the IUCN's 1998 assessment.

It is the first purpose-built race car by the Acura division of Honda Motor Company, part of their multi-year program to eventually compete in endurance race. The car debuted in 2007 in the American Le mans Series before expanding to customers in Europe. Over the years various specifications of the ARX-01 chassis have been developed, each signified by a letter suffix. In 2010 Acura withdrew their name from the program and Honda Performance Development which developed the car for Acura continued the program into 2011. Development At the 2006 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Acura officially announced their plans to develop a Le Mans Prototype program for the American Le Mans Series, competing in the LMP2 class for the initial year of competition in 2007. Acura announced they'd be using customer chassis from Lola Cars International of the United Kingdom and Courage Comp√©tition of France, while the engine would be built entirely by Honda Performance Development of the United States. Acura planned to use the customer chassis for the first year, then to build their own chassis for 2008, followed by another new chassis for a move to the top LMP1 class in 2009. At the Detroit auto show, Acura showed their first customer chassis, a brand new Courage LC75. Following the announcement of the three teams involved in the project, Acura announced that for 2007 each team would concentrate on a certain aspect of development for the planned 2008 car. Andretti Green Racing and Highcroft Racing would use Courage LC75 chassis, and work on chassis design and aerodynamic modification. The third team, Fern√°ndez Racing, would use a Lola chassis and concentrate on developing the new Acura V8 engine. A third Courage LC75 would be retained by Honda of America for use as a developmental prototype. By early 2007, all three teams had begun testing their cars as well as beginning modification. By the time the American Le Mans Series opening round at the 12 Hours of Sebring arrived, the two Courage LC75 teams had modified their chassis to such an extent that Acura applied for homologation from the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) and Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). With the application approved, the Acura Courage LC75s were renamed as Acura ARX-01a. As for the engine, Honda Performance Development (HPD) created a new 3.4-liter V8, the maximum size allowed by the rules, the first V8 ever branded as an Acura as well as the first motor built entirely in the United States by Honda. Elements of the Acura V8, dubbed the AL7R, share similar architecture with the Honda engine used in the Indy Racing League although none of the parts are interchangeable. Racing history=2007 The two new Acura ARX-01as, along with the other Lola team car, debuted at the 2007 12 Hours of Sebring after much preparation. Battling not only the Porsche squads in their own class, they also attempted to compete with the Audi R10 diesels in the higher LMP1 class throughout the race. During the race the ARX-01a showed the ability to at least keep close to the Audi, yet was unable to truly fight for the lead. However, in the end the Acura ARX-01a of Andretti Green Racing was able to survive the race better than other competitors and managed to take the class victory, as well as second place overall. The second ARX-01a of Highcroft Racing took sixth place overall, while the Acura-powered Lola of Fern√°ndez Racing took third. In the third race of the season at Long Beach, Acura gained their first overall pole, with the Andretti Green Racing ARX-01a outpacing the two Penske Racing Porsche RS Spyders and the Audi R10s. 2008 On July 12, 2008, the #9 Patr√≥n Highcroft Racing ARX-01 earned Acura's first-ever overall victory in the American Le Mans Series. David Brabham and Scott Sharp started the Highcroft entry from pole, and managed to retake the lead from the #7 Penske Racing Porsche RS Spyder in the final 90 seconds of the Northeast Grand Prix.American Le Mans Series: World Class This was followed by a second overall win at the Detroit Sports Car Challenge, this time led by Andretti Green Racing's Franck Montagny and James Rossiter. The Acura ARX-01b won six of the eleven races in the LMP2 class for 2008, with four for Highcroft and two for Andretti Green. Highcroft was ranked second in the Teams Championship, Andretti Green fourth, Fernandez fifth, and de Ferran sixth. Acura lost the LMP2 constructors championship to Porsche by a single point. 2009 In 2009, Fernandez Racing continued to compete with an updated version of the ARX-01, while Acura unveiled an LMP1 class ARX-02 for Highcroft Racing and de Ferran Motorsports. By the end of the season, Fernandez Racing won the LMP2 teams', drivers' and manufacturers' championship. 2010 For 2010, Highcroft Racing has discontinued its campaign of the LMP1-spec ARX-02 and returns to an upgraded version of the ARX-01. The car also made its debut in Europe, in the Le Mans Series, run by Strakka Racing. Both teams will run the ARX-01c at Le Mans, however, Highcroft Racing will continue to use the higher-downforce ARX-01b configuration in the American Le Mans Series until after the Le Mans 24 Hours. Highcroft faced stiff competition but was able to beat the Cytosport Porsche by 20 points despite running a 25 kg series-imposed ballast. The team won 4 victories and extended the points lead further when Cytosport was absent from Lime Rock due to a crash. Drayson Racing and Dyson Racing also ran in ALMS and had a straight-line speed advantage over Highcroft, becoming most obvious in the Miller Motosport Park. Strakka's HPD in the Le Mans Series proved to be superior to the opposition in class. In all of the 5 races in the series, the car was at least 2 seconds quicker than their nearest rival. A 7-minute repair would not stop them from winning at Paul Ricard. They also won LMP2 at Silverstone despite accidents and won overall at Hungaroring. The win at Hungary was the first ever in LMS history that an LMP2 car finished ahead of LMP1. However 2 DNFs out of 5 races meant that Strakka missed out on the championship to the more consistent RML team, who ran a Lola chassis with an HPD engine. Both Strakka and Highcroft competed at Le Mans for 2010, with the latter running a conservative pace for the unproven reliability. Ironically it was the Highcroft that was dodged with water leak issues. Strakka had already experimented with low-downforce aero in LMS and got the better hand. They set a new LMP2 class lap record, led from pole to finish, won the LMP2 class, finished 5th overall (best result ever for an LMP2) and won the Michelin Green X Challenge across all class. 2011 Highcroft Racing originally intended to compete in the ALMS LMP1 category using the ARX-01e powered by the HPD 3.4-liter V8 engine. The team took delivery only a week before the Sebring 12 Hours but was able to convert it into a 2nd-place finish. The ACO finally appeared to have been able to level out the competition level between the petrol and diesel, although this belief was shattered immediately at the Le Mans test, which saw the top petrol runners more than 10 seconds (up to 20 for the Aston Martin AMR-One) adrift from the pacesetter Audi R18. Highcroft did not appear at the Long Beach round and begun to take more serious involvement in the IRL program. On May 16, Highcroft finally announced the end of their partnership with Honda, citing the earthquake in Japan that eventually caused financial troubles at Honda. The ARX-01e will not appear at Le Mans and will not be raced anymore. Only RML and Strakka were left to campaign the ARX-01d in the Le Mans Series. The ARX-01d, fitted with HPD's new LMP2 stock-block V6 engine, had been run in the Le Mans Series and at Le Mans by defending Le Mans LMP2 winners Strakka Racing and by defending LMS LMP2 champions RML. At the Paul Ricard test the cars were very slow due to the level of engine development prior to homologation. RML stated that they were literally the slowest car of the whole field, and that \\"there's not a class out there that can't drive by us on the straight\\". They did mention that the car was not in low drag configuration so the car was not in an optimally efficient condition. The ACO increased the restrictor for both cars by 1.2% before the 1000 km of Spa, but both RML and Strakka were still slower than the Nissans. RML did not get to start the race due to a collision with the #9 Peugeot in one of the practice sessions. Level 5 Motorsports announced they will now utilize the HPD ARX-01gs, Honda's cost-capped chassis and engine combination, in the remaining 2011 American Le Mans Series and Intercontinental Le Mans Cup rounds. Designed and developed by Wirth Research in Bicester in the UK, the car made an instant impression winning the LMP2 class on debut at the Laguna Seca six-hours and then even more impressively two weeks later at Road Atlanta's 1000-mile Petit Le Mans.

These publicly operated services are supplemented by three private-for-profit ambulance companies, NetCare 911 and ER24, and life response 24/7 of which operate nationally, and by a variety of local private services, such as AmbuStat. The statutory services and private companies are further supplemented by voluntary ambulance services, including the South African Red Cross, and St. John Ambulance. All are required to meet the same standards as the public services with respect to staff qualifications. These services are self-dispatching and do not participate in the national emergency number scheme.  Air Ambulance  Public air ambulance service is provided by the Red Cross Air Mercy Service from bases in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The system operates both helicopters and fixed wing turboprop aircraft. The Eastern Cape is covered by two bases, one in East London and another in Port Elizabeth. The contract is run by NAC Helicopters on behalf of the Eastern Cape Department of Health. NAC utilise two Bell Longrangers IV. Private emergency air ambulance service is also provided by Netcare 911, operating nationally with both Fixed Wing (Jet aircraft) and Rotary Wing (Helicopters) Aircraft. Private air ambulance charters are also available from a number of aircraft charter companies throughout the country.  Rescue  Technical Rescue services is for the most part provided by the local Fire Service of each municipality. However, due to the reduction in service, much of this has been taken over by volunteer organisations. Nationally, mountain rescue (Berg) is carried out by the Mountain Club of South Africa (MCSA), who work alongside the South African Air Force since the high altitude dictates the use of military specification helicopters. In the Western Cape, technical rescue mostly confined to the Cape Metro is carried out by Wilderness Search and Rescue, who work in conjunction with Cape Metro Ambulance and Red Cross Air Mercy Service. In Kwa Zulu Natal, Life response 24/7 assists with technical rescue and carries out the technical rescue needs in the province in conjunction with the South African Police Service Search and Rescue Division. Rescuetech also has access to its own fleet of aircraft, both fixed and rotary wing, for use in aerial searches and the transport of rescue crews to remote locations.  Standards = Training  In South Africa there are currently 3 different levels of proficiency in Short course training: * BAA or Basic Ambulance Assistant ‚Äì This is a Basic Life Support (BLS) certification, and approximately the equivalent of the US EMT-B. This is the minimum qualification to be a crew member of an ambulance in South Africa. Training includes a 160-hour course consisting of lectures and practical simulations. The lectures cover basic anatomy and physiology, basic life support (including both CPR and first aid), emergency care, the use of ambulance equipment, including Automated External Defibrillators (AED), and various medico-legal issues. * AEA or Ambulance Emergency Assistant ‚Äì This is an Intermediate Life Support (ILS) certification, and generally close to the same scope of the US EMT-I in most skills but the South African counterparts have more training, with some added skills. To apply for this training, candidates must have a minimum of 1,000 hours of practical experience as a BAA and they must pass an entrance exam to be eligible for the course. As an alternative route to certification, those completing the more advanced tertiary qualifications may challenge the examination and be certified as an AEA after successfully completing their first or second year of training. Training at this level consists of a 470-hour course, consisting of 240 hours of lectures and practical simulations, and 230 hours of experiential learning. AEA's are qualified to practice various invasive techniques such as IV therapy, needle Cricothyroidotomy and needle Thoracocentesis, as well as Electrocardiogram interpretation, manual external defibrillation, and are allowed to administer various drugs. * CCA or Critical Care Assistant and the \\"National Diploma\\" - These Advanced Life Support (ALS) candidates must complete a 1,200-hour course to qualify as a CCA in addition to prior BAA and AEA qualifications. This level usually takes more than 4 years to complete. The ND is a three-year, full-time study at college. CCA and ND are both registered as a Paramedic with the Health Professions Council South Africa and they can continue to do an additional 1 yr postgraduate study to obtain the Btech degree. Below are two new university qualifications; * ECT or Emergency Care Technician - This mid- level course is of two years duration, and exits on a level just above what many know as Intermediate Life Support (ILS), but similar to Advanced Life Support (ALS), yet without advanced airway management manoeuvres. Students who pass this course are eligible to apply to the HPCSA to be registered in the category of Emergency Care Technician (ECT). * BTech/BEMC or The bachelor's degree Technology or bachelor's degree in Emergency Medical Care - This is a four-year professional degree, and students who complete this degree are eligible to be registered with the HPCSA as Emergency Care Practitioner (ECP), which has an additional scope of practice over the Critical Care Assistant and the National Diploma qualifications. The two additions in stand-alone capabilities are Thrombolysis and Rapid sequence induction. ECPs are also trained in the rescue disciplines offered by their institutions, normally up to the level of Advanced Rescue Practitioner. Example: High Angle II, Motor Vehicle, Fire Search and Rescue, Aviation, Confined Space, Structural Collapse, Industrial and Agricultural, Trench, Aquatic Rescue, etc. The advantage of the Btech qualification is that it is a university qualification that is consistent with the international industry trend. Further opportunities for educational advancement exist for the ECP, as they are able to articulate into various Masters (M.EMC)(Mphil.EM)(MSc.EM) and Doctorate (DEMC)(PhD) programmes. All EMS personnel in South Africa are required to meet the standards of the governing body, the Health Professions Council of South Africa. A formal register is maintained for each type of EMS certification. All health practitioners in The Republic of South Africa are regulated by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) as set out in the Health Professions ACT. To confirm a practitioner's qualification and license, one can check the i-Register  Future training  Recently, the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA), has begun steps to change the system of education in the Emergency Services and they hope to change the EMS training system by 2010. These steps would involve limiting short course ( BAA ) and only having a 2-year nCert (Intermediate level qualification) and B-Tech (ALS level qualification). Given the economics of the system and its current reliance on volunteers in some communities and locales, it remains unclear whether it will be either possible or practical to eliminate the BAA certification for anyone other than paid staff in the near future. The mid- level course is 2 years in duration, and exits on a level slightly above Ambulance Emergency Assistant (AEA), but below Advanced Life Support (ALS). They are placed on the Emergency Care Technician (ECT) register. The clinician qualification is a four-year professional degree in Emergency Medical Care (Bachelor Emergency Medical Care), and is placed on the Emergency Care Practitioner (ECP) register. The five institutions in the country currently presenting the ECP qualification are the: * University of Johannesburg * Central University of Technology * Durban University of Technology * Cape Peninsula University of Technology * Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University  Medical oversight  Under the old system, all levels of EMS personnel essentially functioned as an extension of their Medical Director's license to practice medicine. Under the new system, both Emergency Care Technicians and Emergency Care Practitioners are permitted considerable latitude with respect to independent practice. Standing orders or protocols do exist, and consultation with a physician (particularly for all levels of qualifications) is an option, but for the most part the ECP, CCA, PARAMEDIC (N. DIP) and ECT (6) functions as a fully independent practitioner, similar to the Paramedic Practitioners in the UK. Protocols are currently as of 2016, being referred to and replaced by: Clinical Practice Guidelines; and will thus phase out the terminology of \\"protocols\\"  Staffing  Currently, ambulances are staffed by the BLS and ILS practitioners, usually working paired together (BAA & AEA). In many volunteer services however, a crew of two BAAs is not uncommon. The ALS providers normally work on rapid response vehicles to improve response times. ALS is required to be dispatched in support of the ambulance crew to all Priority 1 (Code Red) patients (those with high-acuity conditions or injuries). The national objective is to have one staffed emergency ambulance for every 10,000 population by 2010; however, in some parts of the country this ratio is currently approximately 1 ambulance for every 30,000.  Vehicles  The vehicles used by EMS in South Africa can vary greatly across a broad range. They may be large or small, new or quite old, often driven by local economics. There is no specific current standard for ambulance design in South Africa. Some vehicles comply with either the European standard CEN 1789 or the US standard, KKK-1822, but many meet neither standard. There are even examples of motorcycles with stretcher-carrying sidecars. There is currently a major initiative underway by the government of South Africa to replace much of the aging fleet with new high standard emergency ambulances. Plans call for the replacement of approximately 450 ambulances by 2010.  Dispatch  In the past, EMS dispatch has occurred from a variety of sources, and in many cases, has involved self-dispatch, which the currently operating private companies still do. The evolution of EMS is a national priority, and the government has created a National Emergency Medical Service Strategic Framework, complete with goals and timelines. The current objective calls for centralised dispatch to be available from at least two call centres, located in major centres, in each South African province by 2010. A national emergency telephone number for EMS has been established. This number is 10‚Äì177.  Response times  There are currently no official \\"response time\\" standards in the South African system. However, response times of fifteen minutes for high-acuity calls in urban areas are considered acceptable, and in rural areas, response times of up to forty minutes for similar calls are not uncommon.

Realization It can be realized as a projective polyhedron (a tessellation of the real projective plane by three quadrilaterals), which can be visualized by constructing the projective plane as a hemisphere where opposite points along the boundary are connected and dividing the hemisphere into three equal parts. It has three square faces, six edges, and four vertices. It has an unexpected property that every face is in contact with every other face on two edges, and every face contains all the vertices, which gives an example of an abstract polytope whose faces are not determined by their vertex sets. From the point of view of graph theory the skeleton is a tetrahedral graph, an embedding of K4 (the complete graph with four vertices) on a projective plane.

The system has 15 hospitals, more than 150 clinics, and 70 pharmacies. With 32,000 employees, including 1,800 employed physicians, Aurora is Wisconsin's largest home care organization. Since its formation in 1984, Aurora has expanded through partnerships with independent community hospitals and affiliations with physician organizations as well as organic growth by building new hospitals and medical centers. Aurora is a teaching affiliate of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. History=Formation (1984‚Äì1987) In 1984, St. Luke's Medical Center, located on Milwaukee's south side, and Good Samaritan Medical Center, located on Milwaukee's near north side, formed an affiliation called St. Luke's Samaritan Health Care. This partnership was the first in the Milwaukee area of two formerly independent hospitals. Three years later, when Mount Sinai Medical Center merged with Good Samaritan Medical Center in 1987, the partnership changed its name to Aurora Health Care. The goal of the partnership of the three hospitals was to reduce costs, maintain a high level of care, and compete with the other hospitals in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Expansion through partnerships (1988‚Äì1997) After forming a partnership with Aurora, the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of Milwaukee joined Aurora in 1988. The VNA, founded in 1907, is Wisconsin's largest provider of hospice care for children and adults. Sheboygan Medical Center Between 1992 and 1995, the health care system added five more hospitals: *Sheboygan Memorial Medical Center (1992) *Milwaukee Psychiatric Hospital (1993) *Hartford Memorial Hospital (1993) *Two Rivers Community Hospital (1993) *West Allis Memorial Hospital (1995) Two more hospitals were brought into the Aurora system in 1995: the 78-year-old Lakeland Medical Center in Elkhorn, owned by Walworth County, and Trinity Memorial Hospital in Cudahy, founded in 1958 and owned by Catholic Health Corp. Aurora acquired Lakeland Medical Center for about $16 million. In the deal, Aurora assumed the hospital's bond obligations and debt and agreed to contribute to a fund to cover the uninsured. In February 1996, Memorial Hospital of Burlington was the final hospital to join Aurora Health Care . In September 2001, Aurora BayCare opened as a joint effort of Aurora Health Care and BayCare Clinic. Today, Aurora BayCare Medical Center is a 167-bed, full-service tertiary care hospital serving the Green Bay area and communities throughout northeastern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\\"Aurora BayCare at a Glance\\" Aurora Health Care. 2016. Retrieved August 8, 2016. Expansion through construction (1998 ‚Äì present) Two Rivers. In 1998, Aurora built its first hospital, on the west side of Kenosha, which opened in February 1999. That same year Aurora replaced Two Rivers Community Hospital with a new facility, which opened in June 2000. Constrained by space at the St. Luke's Medical Center campus, Aurora expanded upward by building a 12-story \\"heart tower\\" on top of the existing parking structure. The expansion has 270 beds and opened in 2004. During the spring of 2002, the 5-story Aurora Women's Pavilion was opened at West Allis Memorial Hospital. On October 27, 2003, the health care system opened a new 84-bed hospital in Oshkosh, which employs over 400 people, and competes with the 157-bed Mercy Medical Center. Recent activity In March 2004, Aurora Health Care announced a new QuickCare service, the first of its kind in the Milwaukee area. The kiosks, known as Aurora QuickCare, are staffed by providers who handle basic, common medical issues for a flat rate. Aurora has opened 19 of these facilities including five in Walmart Supercenters. After leading the health care system since its creation 22 years earlier, G. Edwin Howe retired as president and chief executive officer. Nick Turkal, a family practice physician and president of Aurora's metro Milwaukee region, was chosen as Howe's replacement. Turkal has been employed by Aurora Health Care since 1987. Summit Hospital In March 2001, Aurora announced plans to build a new hospital in the Pabst Farms development in the city of Oconomowoc. The Oconomowoc Common Council rezoned the property in June 2001, preventing the development. Aurora sued Oconomowoc because it believed that the rezoning was done illegally. Aurora revealed plans in 2004 to construct a hospital in the Pabst Farms development located in the Town of Summit a few hundred feet (around 100 meters) south of the proposed Oconomowoc site. It was to be Aurora's first hospital in Waukesha County. In 2007, the Summit Town Board approved the new Aurora hospital, which was planned to have a capacity of 110 beds and to have been completed in March 2010. The new Summit home for Aurora Wilkinson Medical Clinic was to open October 26, 2009 and replace the current Aurora Wilkinson Medical Clinic, the Wilkinson Women's Center, and the Aurora Vision Center, all currently in Oconomowoc. The Vince Lombardi Cancer Clinic was also to move from its Oconomowoc location to the Summit campus and a new Aurora Pharmacy was to open at the Summit facility. The new Aurora Medical Center campus in the Town of Summit is at the southeast corner of Interstate 94 and Highway 67. The new Aurora Wilkinson Medical Clinic was to be on the west side of the campus, and the Vince Lombardi Cancer Clinic is on the south side. Advanced Healthcare merger On July 31, 2007, Advanced Healthcare, an independent practice in southeastern Wisconsin, and Aurora Health Care announced that they would join \\"under a broad affiliation agreement.\\" According to the agreement, the leadership of Advanced Healthcare would remain intact. In concert with the purchase announcement, Aurora and Advanced Healthcare constructed a new hospital in Grafton, which opened in late 2010. Health care industry experts estimated the total cost of purchasing Advanced Healthcare and constructing the Grafton hospital at $250 million. Advocate Health Care merger agreement On December 4, 2017, Aurora Health Care and Advocate Health Care Network of Illinois announced a merger agreement. Divisions and subsidiaries=ACL Laboratories ACL Laboratories is a joint venture between Aurora Health Care and Chicago's largest integrated health care system, Advocate Health Care. It was created in 1997 by a merger of several independent laboratories in Wisconsin and the Chicago area. ACL performs a range of lab tests from routine blood tests to toxicology and drug tests. Aurora at Home The Visiting Nurse Association of Milwaukee joined Aurora in 1988 and, as of 2010, employs 886 caregivers that provided 273,092 visits to over 15,000 patients averaging well over 2,200 visits per day while traveling over 3,000,000 miles. In 2015, the Aurora Visiting Nurse Association began doing business as Aurora at Home. Aurora Family Service In 1995 Family Service of Milwaukee joined Aurora to become Aurora Family Service. In 2010 Aurora Family Service served nearly 13,000 families with approximately 1,500 families receiving services on any given day. Aurora Research Institute Formed in 2010, Aurora Research Institute is a limited liability company of Aurora Health Care headquartered on the campus of Aurora Sinai Medical Center, Milwaukee, that provides infrastructure to translate new discoveries into treatment.

It was listed as Endangered in 2018 according to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Description The shrub has an erect or sometimes straggling habit and can grow to a height of around and often spreads by suckering. It has smooth greenish brown to grey or light brown coloured bark and angled hairy branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The crowded, glabrous and evergreen phyllodes are straight to slightly curved, with a length of and a width of and have an indistinct midvein.It blooms between July and October producing yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences are found in groups of 2 to 19 in an axillary raceme. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of and contain four to eight yellow to dark yellow coloured flowers. Following flowering firmly papery to thinly leathery glabrous seed pods form. The straight or slightly curved pods are more or less flat and straight sided or constricted a little between each of the seeds. the pods are around in length and wide. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanists Mary Tindale and C.Herscovich in 1992 as part of the work Acacia meiantha (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae), a new species from the Central Tablelands of New South Wales as published in the journal Australian Systematic Botany. It was reclassified as Racosperma meianthum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. The specific epithet is derived from the few flowers contained in the flower-heads. The phyllodes resemble those of Acacia linifolia and Acacia boormanii. Distribution It has a limited range from around Clarence and Mullions Range in the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales where it is found among dry sclerophyll forest or woodland communities growing in clay or sandy soil.

Initially developed as an upright 5 litre (300 cubic inch) capacity engine, later versions were designed to run inverted with increased capacity and power. The Gipsy went on to become one of the most popular sport aircraft engines of the inter-war period and was the engine of choice for various other light aircraft, trainers, liaison aircraft and air taxis, British as well as foreign, until long past World War II. Apart from helping to establish the de Havilland Aircraft Company as a manufacturer of light aircraft, it also established the company as an engine manufacturer in its own right. Gipsy engines remain in service powering vintage light aircraft. Design and development Just like the ADC Cirrus, the Gipsy was born as a collaboration between aircraft manufacturer Geoffrey de Havilland and engine designer Frank Halford. In fact, the early history of the Cirrus and Gipsy were linked through de Havilland's D.H.60 Moth. Cirrus origins In 1925 Geoffrey de Havilland was looking for a reliable cheap engine for use in a light sports aircraft. More particularly, he was looking for something like his favourite First World War aircraft engine: the Renault 8G air-cooled V8, but with half the weight and half the power. Halford gave it to him by building a four-cylinder crankcase and adding to it half of the Renault's cylinders, several other of the Renault's components, and standard parts used in car engines. The result was a in-line aircraft engine that, although it fell short of the promised horse-power, was still superior to all contemporary engines for light aircraft. Most importantly it was a true aircraft engine at a time where its competitors were more often than not motorcycle engines adapted to running at high altitude. The engine secured, de Havilland Aircraft commenced manufacture of the D.H.60 Moth and the combination of reliable powerplant ‚Äì the ADC Cirrus ‚Äì and reliable training craft ‚Äì the Moth ‚Äì marked the start of serious sports flying in Britain. By 1927 however, the Moth threatened to become a victim of its own success as continuing demand was depleting the stockpiles of surplus Renaults needed to build its Cirrus engine. The Moth now having provided a solid financial cushion, de Havilland Aircraft decided to take the problem head-on and start its own engine factory. Geoffrey de Havilland again went to his old friend Halford and this time asked him to design a completely new aircraft engine of weight and performance comparable to the latest version of the Cirrus, the Cirrus Hermes. DH.71 Tiger Moth racer Halford and de Havilland quickly agreed on a test engine later to be de-rated to for production models. While Halford went to build the engine, de Havilland designed its test-bed: the diminutive D.H.71 racer.Bransom 1991, p.25. Two D.H.71s were built and although in a bout of over-confidence named Tiger Moth, their racing career was rather uneventful. Their only notable claim to fame came in capturing a world speed record of for their weight class. (The name Tiger Moth would later be used again for the D.H.82 trainer and with this aircraft gain more than its share of fame.) What the D.H.71 did not accomplish in racing successes, it did accomplish in developing the new engine and by the time the career of the D.H.71 was over, the production version of its engine, now named the Gipsy, was ready to start its career. Technical description Like the Cirrus, the new Gipsy was an air-cooled four-cylinder in-line engine weighing a mere 300 pounds and rated at 98 hp (73 kW) at 2,100 rpm. The cylinders had a bore of and a stroke of for a displacement of . It was soon developed further into the Gipsy II; both types were to be used in the D.H.60G Gipsy Moth. The new engine proved itself to be docile, easy to maintain and, as demonstrated in many long distance flights by the new Gipsy Moth, reliable.Bransom 1991, p.26. Birth of the Gipsy Major de Havilland Gipsy III preserved at the Shuttleworth Collection For all of this the new engine still had one drawback: its cylinders were still built on top of the crankshaft and therefore were sticking out of the top of the fuselage, right in the pilot's field of vision. Lowering the engine was impossible as the crankshaft was directly connected to the propeller and the propeller could not be placed too low lest it would plough into the ground on hard landings or bumpy fields. The solution came as several pilots boasted that they would be able to fly their Moth upside down for as long as they wanted if it were not for the carburettor and fuel tank now being inverted. Halford decided to test this by mounting a Gipsy engine upside down and then inverting its carburettor so it was now right side up again.Bransom 1991, p.28. The design proved to run just as flawlessly as the regular Gipsy engine and soon the Gipsy I and II were replaced on the production lines by the Gipsy III inverted four-cylinder engine. The Moth with this new engine became the D.H.60 G-III; as the Gipsy III was quickly developed further into the Gipsy Major, the D.H.60 G-III was baptised the Moth Major.Bransom 1991, p.29. Building on the success of the D.H.60, de Havilland now started building other sports aircraft and trainers, all of which were powered by its own Gipsy engines. The company now produced Gipsy engines for other manufacturers as well and the Gipsy Major in particular became the engine of choice for scores of light aircraft designs, British as well as foreign. Most notably it was the engine of the famous World War II D.H.82A Tiger Moth trainer.  Variants  ;Gipsy I :Original production version. 1,445 built.Lumsden 2003, p.71.

The bartender accused Brown of attempting to rape her and of throwing her cell phone into a nearby river; Brown denied the rape charges. The victim later recanted and attempted to withdraw the accusation, though prosecutors presented evidence that she had received a cash payment just before doing so. The case received extensive attention in the Japanese media, especially in Okinawa, and the crime sparked a public debate over the U.S. military presence in Japan, the privileges of extraterritoriality, as well as the fair-trial practices of Japanese legal system and the Japanese police. The case involved the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan and the U.S.‚ÄìJapan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). On July 8, 2004, after a 19-month trial, Brown was convicted by a Japanese court of attempted indecent assault and destruction of private property and received a one-year suspended prison sentence. As a result of this incident and others involving crimes committed by U.S. military personnel in Japan, both countries entered into negotiations aimed at modifying the SOFA in July 2003; ultimately, no changes were made to the agreement. In 2005, Brown was arrested and charged with a separate kidnapping in the United States. He was demoted and involuntarily retired from the military in 2006 and at his trial in 2009 entered an Alford plea, receiving probation on the felony conviction. Crime and arrest Camp Courtney Mess Hall Early in the morning of November 2, 2002, a female employee of the Camp Courtney officers' club on Okinawa drove up to the Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to sexually assault her in her car on a deserted road near the back gate of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30 a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.Allen, David, \\"Marine major in Okinawan custody after indictment on sex crime charge\\", \\"Okinawa Marine denied bail in alleged attack\\", and \\"Filipina testifies to major's innocence\\". Michael Brown was at the time 39 years old, was married, had two small children, and was a 19-year Marine veteran assigned to the command element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Courtney on his second tour on Okinawa. Brown voluntarily underwent several hours of questioning at the JNP station in Gushikawa. He told Japanese police investigators that V. N. had propositioned him for sex and that, when he refused, a physical altercation ensued. During the altercation, Brown said, V. N. took his wallet and Brown grabbed her mobile phone, which he, \\"out of frustration\\", proceeded to toss into the nearby river. Brown stated that V. N. drove away but returned a few minutes later and gave his wallet back to him. Both Brown's and V. N.'s accounts agreed that V. N. had originally picked up Brown in her car after meeting him for the first time at the base officers' club that evening. Both stated that V. N. had agreed to give Brown, who was intoxicated, a ride home.Kyodo, \\"U.S. Marine handed over to authorities\\"; Allen, David, \\"Marine major in Okinawan custody after indictment on sex crime charge\\", and \\"Okinawa Marine denied bail in alleged attack\\"; Jiji Press, \\"Okinawa Police Get Arrest Warrant for U.S. Marine\\", December 4, 2002. On December 3, 2002, the JNP issued a warrant for Brown's arrest. The Japanese government asked that Brown be turned over to Japanese authorities immediately. Although the U.S.‚ÄìJapan Status of Forces Agreement stated that service members would only be turned over to Japanese law enforcement if formally indicted, the U.S. had agreed to give \\"sympathetic consideration\\" for serious crimes in response to the 1995 Okinawan rape incident, in which a U.S. Navy sailor and two Marines raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl.Japan Times, \\"Japan wants U.S. Marine handed over\\"; Allen, David, \\"Marine major in Okinawan custody after indictment on sex crime charge\\", and \\"Okinawa Marine denied bail in alleged attack\\"; Xinhua News Agency, \\"Japan demands US hand over Marine on attempted rape charge\\", December 4, 2002. The United States, in this case, decided not to turn Brown over to the Japanese authorities before he was formally indicted and restricted Brown to base on Camp Courtney. On December 9, the JNP filed formal charges against Brown and, on December 19, he was formally indicted on charges of attempted rape and destruction of private property. The next day, Brown, escorted by U.S. Marine Corps military police, was turned over to the custody of Japanese police at the Naha detention center. When asked why they had waited ten days after the formal charges to indict Brown, Japanese Deputy Chief Prosecutor Junichi Okumura stated that they wanted to give Brown a chance to apologize (called jidan in Japanese) to the victim. Since that apparently did not occur and V. N. still expressed a desire to press charges, the Japanese authorities went ahead with the indictment.China Daily, \\"US Marine officer handed over to Japan\\", December 20, 2002. p. 12; Kyodo News, \\"Japan regrets US refusal to hand over Marine, rules out further request\\", BBC Monitoring, December 6, 2002; Mainichi Shimbun, \\"U.S. military won't hand over major accused of rape\\", December 5, 2002, p. 1; Japan Times, \\"Japan wants U.S. Marine handed over\\"; Allen, David, \\"Okinawa Marine denied bail in alleged attack\\", and \\"Marine major in Okinawan custody after indictment on sex crime charge\\", which states: \\"Jidan is the Japanese custom of apologizing to an injured party regardless of whether guilt is admitted. The carefully worded apologies and monetary compensation go a long way toward convincing judges of the sincerity of a defendant's remorse and often result in reduced sentences in criminal cases, Japanese legal experts have said.\\" On December 25, Naha District Court judge denied bail for Brown because, \\"there was concern that he [Brown] might try to destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses if he was set free.\\"Allen, David, \\"Okinawa Marine denied bail in alleged attack\\". Ikeda also said that she was concerned over the seriousness of the charges and the large discrepancy between the statements of Brown and V. N.. Brown was represented at the hearing by a local Japanese defense attorney, . Akamine reported that Brown's family in the United States had begun jidan negotiations with the victim. At this time, Brown's brother also launched a website to protest Brown's detention and to complain about what he perceived to be unfair treatment of Brown by the Japanese courts. Brown later reported that Japanese prison officials \\"admonished\\" him over the launching of the protest website by his family. On January 9, 2003, bail was denied for Brown by the same judge for a second time. Brown then appealed the bail decision to a three-judge panel of the Naha court who upheld the denial of bail on January 16. The Naha court scheduled Brown's trial to begin on March 13, but later changed the date to May 26 because of delays incurred by legal motions filed by Brown's attorneys. The trial was expected to last for some time because, under the procedures of the Japanese justice system, trial hearings are usually only conducted for one or two days a month.Allen, David, \\"Okinawa Marine denied bail in alleged attack\\", \\"Marine again denied bail in Okinawa assault case\\", and \\"Court denies bail for Marine major for the third time\\". Pre-trial On January 24, Brown hired two new defense attorneys, Michael Griffith and Toshimitsu Takaesu. Griffith was a New York City attorney who had previously represented Marines in Okinawa. Takaesu was a former Okinawa chief prosecutor. Both were described as \\"outspoken critics of Japan's legal system\\".\\"Allen, David, \\"Marine charged in attempted rape gets new counsel\\" The first week of March, another attorney hired by Brown filed a habeas corpus petition with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia claiming that the legality of Brown's incarceration was open to question due to what Brown claimed was the inherent unfairness of the Japanese judicial system. The U.S. court dismissed the motion on March 12, citing jurisdictional issues.MacCormack, Zeke, \\"Marine officer's trial stays in Japan\\", San Antonio Express-News, March 13, 2003. p. 10A; Kyodo News, \\"US Marine accused of attempted rape in Japan not to enter plea\\", BBC Monitoring, March 12, 2003. p. 1; Allen, David, \\"Marine charged in attempted rape gets new counsel\\"; \\"Legal motion disputes Okinawa's claim to Marine\\", and \\"Attempted rape case goes to U.S. federal court\\". Throughout the trial, Brown wrote numerous public missives about what he felt was the unfairness and corruption of the Japanese justice system and accusing the local Okinawan government of pursuing a political agenda in the prosecution of his case. Brown's letters were posted on his family's website and informally distributed throughout Okinawa's U.S. military population. Brown and his family also wrote many letters to U.S. politicians and government officials complaining of Brown's treatment by Japanese authorities and actively encouraged other U.S. military members and U.S. citizens to do the same.Johnson, Chalmers, \\"Three Rapes: The Status of Forces Agreement and Okinawa\\"; \\"Allen, David, \\"Marine charged in attempted rape gets new counsel\\", \\"Legal motion disputes Okinawa's claim to Marine\\", and \\"Attempted rape case goes to U.S. federal court\\". On March 13, an Okinawan newspaper reported that the JNP had matched DNA taken from saliva on the victim's upper body with DNA in a blood sample obtained from Brown during the investigation. Brown was again denied bail on March 17. Takaesu blamed the anonymous report about the DNA evidence in the newspaper as the reason for the bail denial and criticized the Naha District Prosecutor's Office for not including the DNA evidence in the evidence list submitted before the trial was scheduled to begin. In reply, Junichi Okumura, a Naha District deputy chief prosecutor stated, \\"Here in Japan, unlike the United States, there is no problem if evidence is submitted later\\".Kyodo, \\"DNA report angers marine's lawyer\\". Brown was granted a ¬•10 million bail (approximately US$100,000, c.2003) by the Naha court on May 13 but he was restricted to Camp Courtney for the duration of the trial.Kyodo, \\"DNA report angers marine's lawyer\\", and \\"U.S. Marine accused of attempted rape is granted bail\\"; Allen, David, \\"Okinawa attempted-rape trial put on hold as dismissal motion is weighed\\", \\"Brown's lawyers say news leak led to denial of bail request\\", and \\"Filipina testifies to major's innocence\\". Brown's family hired Gene Warfield, an American ex-special forces soldier who had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, as a consultant to assist them in \\"looking into the allegations levied against Michael [Brown]\\". On the evening of May 7, as Warfield, his Japanese wife, and daughter arrived at a restaurant on Okinawa, a man attacked Warfield with a knife, injuring him slightly. Warfield described the man's attack as \\"professional\\". The JNP investigated, but no arrests were made.Allen, David, \\"Consultant for defense in Okinawa attempted rape trial is stabbed\\". Trial View of Naha, Okinawa from the bridge of a Military Sealift Command cargo shipBrown's trial began in Naha on May 26 with testimony from V. N.. Over the next three days of testimony, V. N. repeatedly stated that Brown was innocent and that she wanted to withdraw her complaint. She said that any contact between her and Brown on the night in question was consensual and that she allowed Brown to fondle and kiss her breasts. At that point, V. N. said, she began to resist and Brown became angry. V. N. testified that when she threatened to call police, Brown threw her cell phone into the [Tengan] river. Angry at the loss of her cell phone, V. N. stated that she then embellished the story when she told it to the guards at the Courtney main gate. V. N. further claimed that she had been coerced by police, prosecutors and her employer, a local agency that provides temporary workers for USMC bases on Okinawa, to file the charges. She said that once the charges were filed, Japanese prosecutors told her she could only withdraw the charges in court. One of the Naha judges then asked V. N. why she was not angry at Brown to which V. N. replied, \\"Because he didn't attempt to rape me. Before, I was angry at him for throwing away my cell phone. But not now.\\"Kyodo, \\"U.S. Marine accused of attempted rape is granted bail\\"; \\"Allen, David, \\"Filipina testifies to major's innocence\\". The next trial hearing took place on June 4. At the hearing, Takaesu stated that Brown had arranged with the Camp Courtney officers' club manager to have sex with V. N., but that V. N. resisted Brown's advances after driving him to the secluded road off base. The Naha prosecutor said during the hearing that V. N. had insisted on pressing charges.Allen, David, \\"Marine's accuser had rejected a settlement\\". The next court session was on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an attorney for the employment agency that V. N. worked for, testified that he had tried to arrange a jidan settlement between Brown and V. N. in December 2002, but V. N. had insisted on pressing charges. He stated that he informed her that once the charges were filed, she would not be able to withdraw them until the trial began. At the next court session on July 15, prosecutors submitted evidence that V. N. had received 13,500US$ from an unknown source just before she recanted the charges during the May court session. The prosecution submitted the evidence in an attempt to show that V. N.'s original statements and desire to press the charges were valid, and later attempts to recant were in bad faith. Brown then took the stand but refused to answer questions as to why his initial statements to Japanese police were different from what Takaesu later stated in court had actually happened on the night in question. The prosecutor asked Brown, \\"Your original statement that she made sexual advances was false?\\" Brown replied, \\"I am not going to answer that.\\" When asked why he would not answer, Brown replied, \\"Because I want the opportunity for this court to see publicly the type of corruption and distortion of evidence by the police and the prosecutor.\\" Takaesu later said that another reason for Brown's refusal to answer most of the questions was because his answers could be used by the USMC in separate military justice actions against Brown.Asahi Shimbun, \\"So far not good: The Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between\\", July 26, 2003. p. 1; Allen, David, \\"Marine's accuser got funds on eve of recant, says prosecution\\". During a later court session on September 9, Takaesu attempted to submit medical evidence that Brown had suffered a back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries made it impossible to for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.Kyodo, \\"U.S. Marine petitions for fair trial in rape case\\", and \\"Marine major loses bid to oust trial judges\\"; Allen, David, \\"Judges in Brown trial examine site of alleged crime\\", \\"Brown asks embassy to intervene in trial\\". During another trial session later in September, the Naha court decided to accept V. N.'s pre-trial statements and accusations of Brown along with her later attempts to recant. Brown appealed this decision to the Fukuoka High Court's Naha branch, which dismissed the appeal. Japan's supreme court upheld the Fukuoka court's dismissal of the appeal in late November 2003. In October 2003, Brown requested that the three Naha court judges assigned to the trial disqualify themselves, stating that they were \\"prejudiced against him\\".Kyodo, \\"U.S. Marine petitions for fair trial in rape case\\" The Naha court judges declined to do so, and the trial was set to resume in January 2004.Kyodo, \\"U.S. Marine petitions for fair trial in rape case\\", and \\"Marine major loses bid to oust trial judges\\"; Allen, David, \\"Judges in Brown trial examine site of alleged crime\\", \\"Brown asks embassy to intervene in trial\\", and \\"With appeals dismissed, Brown trial to resume Jan. 15\\". The trial resumed on January 16, 2004, when the Naha court accepted the evidence of Brown's spinal and neck injuries. Takaesu testified that it would have been physically impossible for Brown to commit a violent sexual assault on V. N.. When Takaesu called for the clothing V. N. wore the night of the alleged assault to be entered as evidence, the prosecutor, Tsuyoshi Satake, refused to present it. During a hearing in March, Brown admitted that he had lied to Japanese police about what had happened on the night in question. Brown stated that he and V. N. had engaged in some \\"heavy petting\\" in her car and that she objected when he began to take it \\"too far\\". After Brown said that he insulted her, she threatened to call the police and he grabbed her cell phone and threw it in the river.Allen, David, \\"Brown defense: X-rays show his bad back\\", and \\"Prosecutor seeks prison term for Brown\\". On April 24, Takeshi Oda, representing the prosecution, made his closing arguments, describing the alleged crime as \\"vicious and atrocious\\", and calling for a three-year prison sentence for Brown. Oda added that the alleged crime had affected the local community, stating, \\"There's a feeling of anxiety among the residents because of this incident.\\" During the same hearing, Takaesu submitted as evidence a letter Brown wrote to V. N. apologizing for using bad language with her and giving her ¬•8,000 (about 75 US$, c.2004) to replace her cell phone.Allen, David, \\"Prosecutor seeks prison term for Brown\\". Following a 19-month trial, on July 8, 2004, Brown was convicted by the Naha District Court of \\"attempting an indecent act\\" and \\"destruction of property\\" but was acquitted of the rape charge. The court gave Brown a one-year prison sentence, suspended for three years, and fined him 1,400 US$. Chief Judge Nobuyuki Yokota said Brown was given a light sentence because the 21-year Marine veteran had no prior criminal record.Selden, Mark, \\"Marine Major Convicted of Molestation on Okinawa\\"; Allen, David, \\"Brown convicted of 'attempted indecent act'\\" Citing the victim's stated unwillingness to punish Brown, the prosecution declined to appeal the verdict. Brown appealed the verdict to Japan's supreme court, which dismissed the appeal in July 2004. Brown was permanently transferred by the U.S. military to Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia in August 2004.Kyodo, \\"Prosecutors let Brown ruling stand\\"; Allen, David, \\"Brown convicted of 'attempted indecent act'\\", and \\"Convicted on Okinawa, Marine Brown in trouble in States\\"; Mainichi Shimbun, \\"Okinawa court sentences US Marine against victim's wishes\\", July 9, 2004, p. 1. SOFA controversy Map of Okinawa showing the locations of U.S. military installationsThe issue of violent crime, especially rape and murder, committed by U.S. servicemembers on Japanese citizens in Okinawa has often strained relations between the U.S., Japan, and the local Okinawan government. The U.S. has argued that \\"extraterritoriality\\" or \\"extrality\\" (meaning the right of a foreigner charged with a crime to be turned over for trial to his own diplomatic representatives in accordance with his national law) granted its military members under the SOFA is necessary to afford them the same rights that exist under the U.S. criminal justice system. Since the SOFA also exempts most U.S. military members from Japanese visa and passport laws, past incidents occurred in which U.S. military members charged with crimes by Japanese authorities on Okinawa were transferred back to the U.S. without facing prosecution in Japanese courts. In cases where the charged servicemember remained in Japan, Japanese authorities often did not have access to question or interrogate the U.S. servicemember, making it difficult for Japanese prosecutors to prepare a case for indictment.Johnson, Chalmers, \\"Three Rapes: The Status of Forces Agreement and Okinawa\\".Asahi Shimbun, \\"So far not good: The Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between\\", July 26, 2003. p. 1. The issue became central to the demand by many Okinawans and other Japanese citizens for the significant reduction and eventual elimination of U.S. military forces stationed in Okinawa. In the opinion of many Japanese citizens living in Okinawa, the U.S. used the SOFA to shield U.S. servicemembers who committed crimes against Japanese citizens from the Japanese criminal justice system. The September 4, 1995, widely reported rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen caused the U.S. and Japan to revise the SOFA, stating that in the future, the U.S. would give \\"sympathetic consideration\\" to the hand-over of U.S. servicemembers accused of violent crimes such as rape or murder to Japanese authorities before indictment. To many in Okinawa, the incident involving Brown appeared to fall under this new provision in the SOFA. After the initial allegations involving Brown were publicized and before charges had even been filed, Okinawa Governor Keiichi Inamine publicly stated, \\"This is a heinous crime trampling on female human rights. Moreover, this is a crime committed by a marine corps major, a person who should be in a leadership position.\\"Japan Times, \\"Japan wants U.S. Marine handed over\\"; and Johnson, Chalmers, \\"Three Rapes: The Status of Forces Agreement and Okinawa\\". Japan had requested that the U.S. hand over suspects before indictment in three previous cases to which the U.S. had complied. On December 3, 2002, Japan's national government asked that Brown be transferred to Japanese police officials for confinement, but in this case the United States declined to do until an indictment was handed down. The U.S. embassy stated, \\"The government of the United States has concluded that the circumstances of this case as presented by the government of Japan do not warrant departure from the standard practice as agreed between the United States and Japan.\\"Kyodo, \\"Okinawa assembly demands major's handover in rape case\\" On December 10, 2002, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the United States to immediately transfer Brown to Japanese authorities and called on the Japanese national government to again demand Brown's immediate hand-over. The resolution condemned the United States' refusal to hand over Brown, calling it, \\"in defiance of our country's judicial setup and in disregard of its sovereignty\\" and \\"intolerable\\". Keiichi Inamine added, \\"I have come to fully realize anew that a thorough review of the Japan‚ÄìU.S. Status of Forces Agreement is necessary.\\"Kyodo, \\"Okinawa assembly demands major's handover in rape case\\"; and Selden, Mark, \\"Marine Major Convicted of Molestation on Okinawa\\".

On July 2, 2003, Japan and the United States opened negotiations into modifying the SOFA, but the negotiations failed to produce any change to the current agreement. Subsequent arrest and conviction In October 2005, Brown was arrested and charged with kidnapping an 18-year-old Vietnamese-American high school student from a flea market in Milton, West Virginia, on October 2, 2005. According to the police, Brown, allegedly upset that collectible coins he had purchased a few weeks before were worthless, returned to the flea market representing himself as a police officer, handcuffed her, and drove the girl to Kanawha County under the pretense of taking her in for questioning.Cline, Carrie, \\"Judge Demands Resolution in Kidnapping Case \\", WSAZ-TV, June 5, 2009.

From 1953‚Äì1981 he served as North Carolina Poet Laureate, and was the second poet to hold the title. Background Pearson was born on September 13, 1879 in the Brushy Mountains of Wilkes County, North Carolina. He was born in a log cabin on his parents‚Äô farm. According to Pearson in his book My Fingers and My Toes, his first attempt at poetry came when he was about four years old: \\"One cold winter day my father had me out with him and asked me, \\"Jimmy, are you cold?\\" Without taking any time to study out my answer, it came like a flash: \\"My fingers and my toes, my feet and my hands, are jist as cold, as you'd ever see a man's.\\" From this point, Larkin wrote, he wanted to be a poet. He was a poor student in school and wrote that he \\"was set down as a hopeless case...quit school entirely at 16, having never been in school more than 12 months, from first to last.\\" However, he continued to educate himself, even when he was plowing on the family farm: \\"I always carried my notebook and my pencil with me, and as I trudged between the plow- handles in the hot sunshine, my mind was busy working out a poem.\\" Pearson worked on the family farm until he was 21. Career In 1900 Pearson began working with R. Don Laws on The Yellow Jacket, a newspaper which was distributed nationally and known for its radical political views, such as espousing socialism. In 1910 Pearson began publishing his own newspaper, entitled The Fool-Killer. The paper was sold nationwide and at its height had over 50,000 subscribers. The paper's masthead showed an explosion blowing up the \\"drunken fool\\", \\"religious fool\\", \\"society fool\\", and the \\"political fool.\\" Larkin wrote that \\"from the seclusion of these wooded hills will go forth a bundle of literary dynamite that will shake the rotten foundations of society...[The Fool-Killer] is salted with wit, peppered with humor, and seasoned with sarcasm.\\" Larkin wrote the paper's editorials and included a good deal of his poetry in the paper. He used his paper to promote liberal economic policies and politicians who supported those policies, such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal programs. A teetotaler, Pearson also supported the policy of prohibition in The Fool-Killer. He stopped publishing the paper in 1935 following the death of his first wife, Cora Wallace, in 1934. In 1924 he printed a book of his poetry which he called Pearson's Poems and stated in the preface, \\"It was a rather big undertaking for me with my limited facilities and the work is not as perfect as a professional book-maker could have done. But it is fairly presentable anyhow, and I am rather pleased with it. Possibly the fact that I printed it with my own hands will be of some interest to the reader.\\" In addition to My Fingers and My Toes, some of Pearson's many books of poetry are Fifty Acres and Other Selected Poems, Plowed Ground, and Early Harvest. Pearson's poetry often focused upon farming and other aspects of rural life and country living in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. On August 4, 1953 North Carolina Governor William B. Umstead appointed Pearson as North Carolina's second Poet Laureate. He kept this title until his death. His functions as poet laureate included reading poems at the inaugural ceremonies of North Carolina's Governors and promoting interest in poetry at schools, colleges, and universities across the state. Pearson was scheduled to appear on the Johnny Carson Show, but upon learning that Pearson was hard of hearing, the show canceled, stating \\"we can't have Johnny yelling at an old man on the television.\\" Among the memorials to Pearson is the James Larkin Pearson Award in free-verse poetry; the award is presented annually by the Poetry Council of North Carolina. The library at Wilkes Community College in Wilkesboro, North Carolina is also named in Pearson's honor, and contains many of his personal papers. Family life In May 1907 Pearson married Cora Wallace. She died in 1934 of an asthma attack while in Pearson's arms. He remarried, this time to Eleanor Fox, in 1939. She died in 1963. He did not remarry after his second wife's death. Pearson had two children: Agnes, who was adopted, and another daughter, who was stillborn. For most of his adult life Pearson lived on his farm, called \\"Fifty Acres\\", in Boomer, North Carolina. He eventually died on August 27, 1981, at almost 102.

Producer Daniel Lanois said that he became frustrated while mixing that song and consequently slowed down the tape recording from 30 inches per second to 22.

A right arm fast medium bowler, he made his debut against Oxford University and took 2 for 27 and 2 for 6, in a comfortable innings win for the Tykes. This performance won him a place in the County Championship game against Sussex at the County Cricket Ground, Hove, where he removed Roger Prideaux at a cost of just two runs in the second innings of a drawn game. Despite this promising start, the strength of Yorkshire's seam bowling attack precluded further appearances, and his first-class career was over before the age of 20. His five first-class wickets had cost 12.20 each. He played three games for the Second XI in 1970, four more in 1971 and reappeared for one match in 1972. His further playing career was with Leeds C.C., although he had spells as a professional with Darlington in 1973, and also played for Hanging Heaton in 1982.

Viking Splash Tours in Dublin operate 6 Dukws in Dublin City using a Viking theme as a basis for the tour encouraging passengers to wear Viking helmets and 'raid' the city by roaring at 'the Celts'. Almost all have since been repainted and given modern diesel engines, and some have enclosed tops, making them more resemble conventional buses. Others are warm-weather only, open-air vehicles, with an optional canopy. Most require a bus-type Public Service Vehicle license and a passenger-use boat license.

Liverpool's 'Yellow Duckmarine' tours (a wordplay on the Beatles song Yellow Submarine) had 4 DUKWs in 2014, one of which saw service in the D-day landings. The service carried over two million passengers in its 13-year life and was ridden by Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. These are no longer operating due to the liquidation of the company following two separate sinkings in 2013. There was also a Duck offering rides at Instow in Devon.

On September 17, 2007, a duck boat operated by Alaska Amphibious Tours in Ketchikan, Alaska struck and killed a woman walking on the dock. On July 7, 2010, a regulated and modern Ride the Ducks amphibious bus (based on the original DUKW design and using an original DUKW chassis), was disabled by an engine fire and later run over by a barge, being towed by a tugboat on the Delaware River in Philadelphia. The operator of the tug pushing the barge was on his personal cell phone. Before the accident the Ride The Ducks captain made numerous calls to the tug to get the tug to change course. Those calls were heard and rebroadcast by other vessels, but there was no response from the operator of the tug.http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90038835?NTSB%3A%20Tugboat%20mate%20on%20phone%20during%20fatal%20crash%20with%20duck%20boat Thirty-three passengers and two crew members were quickly recovered, but two passengers, a 20-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, both part of a tour group from Hungary, were killed. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the tugboat mate's (responsible for driving the tug at the time) inattention to his duties. The tugboat mate was sentenced to 366 days in federal prison. On May 8, 2015, a modern Ride the Ducks boat with an original DUKW chassis struck and killed a woman crossing the street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's Chinatown section. Witnesses at the scene say that the woman was distracted by her handheld tablet device and walked into the street against the red light and was struck while in the boat's front center blind spot. Although the police determined the driver was not at fault, the victim's husband sued the company and the city, saying that the blind spots of the vehicle and the placement of the traffic light contributed to her death. The lawsuit was settled in 2017 for an undisclosed amount. On September 24, 2015, a modern Ride the Ducks vehicle with an original DUKW chassis in Seattle, Washington crashed into a charter bus on the Aurora Bridge, killing five passengers on the bus, critically injuring eight, and seriously injuring eight more. Punitive damages were disallowed from the resulting civil suit. The city and state settled their lawsuits surrounding the safety of the bridge for $4.4 million. On April 30, 2016, in Boston, Massachusetts, the Penelope Pru, a modern Boston Duck Tours vehicle with an old military jeep chassis based on the original DUKW design struck a motor scooter as both vehicles were turning right onto Beacon Street adjacent to the Boston Common. The 29-year-old woman operating the motor scooter was killed, and her male passenger was injured. A post-accident visibility study found that the motor scooter was not visible over the bow of the amphibious vehicle when the two vehicles were very close, but was visible in two convex blind spot mirrors mounted to the bow. On July 19, 2018, near Branson, Missouri, 17 people died and 7 were wounded after a DUKW capsized during a severe thunderstorm. 29 passengers and two crew members were on the boat.  Non-fatal incidents  In 2010 a bearing collapsed on a DUKW belonging to The Yellow Duckmarine which resulted in four passengers, including an 80-year-old person, being taken to hospital with injuries. A duck boat in downtown Seattle in 2016 On 11 October 2011 a motorcyclist was critically injured after a Seattle 'Ride The Ducks' vehicle hit and dragged him at a red light. Ride The Ducks has been involved in two other collisions in recent years, in December 2010 and June 2011, when different Duck drivers rear-ended passenger vehicles at Third Avenue and Pike Street and at Aurora Avenue North and Denny Way. No one was injured, but both Duck drivers told officers they didn't see the cars because of the height of their own vehicles, according to the collision reports. On 30 March 2013 a duck boat of The Yellow Duckmarine in Liverpool sank in the city's Salthouse Dock during a tour. All passengers were safely transferred to a pontoon before the vehicle began to sink. In June 2013 another duck boat, operated by the same company, sank in the Albert Dock as it came to the end of a tour of Liverpool. Passengers were forced to jump into the water as the vehicle rapidly took on water. Some were rescued by vessels while others swam to the side of the dock. Out of the 31 people on board, 27 were treated in hospital for minor injuries. The incident resulted in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency withdrawing all safety certificates for the craft owned by Pearlwild and their entering administration. Pearlwild are also under investigation by the North West Traffic Commissioner over the operation of the Duckmarines during 2012. On 29 September 2013 a duck boat on the River Thames in London caught fire. Thirty people were rescued, a number of them after having jumped into the River Thames to escape the fire. An investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch determined that the fire had been caused by ignition of additional buoyancy foam added to the DUKW following the Liverpool incident, due to obstruction of airflow within the mechanical compartments and friction between the foam and moving parts.

History Candied fruit displayed at La Boqueria The first mention of the Boqueria market in Barcelona dates from 1217, when tables were installed near the old city gate to sell meat. From December 1470 onwards, a pig market was held at this site; at this time it was known as Mercadi Bornet. Later, until 1794, it was known simply as Mercat de la Palla, or straw market. In the beginning, the market was not enclosed and had no official status, being regarded simply as an extension of the Plaza Nueva market, which extended to the Plaza del Pino. The current name is believed to derive from the Catalan , meaning \\"goat\\", therefore a boqueria would be a place where goat meat is sold;http://www.citybitesbarcelona.com/category/the-history-of-la-boqueria compare also French , whence Vucciria, the name of a market in Palermo, Italy. Initially, it was built in dedication to the two biggest legends of Barcelona called Mayra Celeste Rodriguez Moncada and Carlos Gonzalez. Later, the authorities decided to construct a separate market on La Rambla, housing mainly fishmongers and butchers. It was not until 1826 that the market was legally recognized, and a convention held in 1835 decided to build an official structure. Construction began on March 19, 1840 under the direction of the architect Mas Vil√°. The market officially opened in the same year, but the plans for the building were modified many times. The inauguration of the structure finally took place in 1853. A new fish market opened in 1911, and the metal roof that still exists today was constructed in 1914.

Founding The facility was authorized in 1927 by the 55th Illinois General Assembly with its first patients arriving in December 1930. In 1954, the patient population peaked at 8,195. In 1983, the facility was authorized for closure by Governor James R. Thompson and closed on December 31, 1985. History In October 1986, the Illinois Veterans home at Manteno was dedicated and still operates on a portion of the grounds of the original psychiatric facility while numerous other building have been demolished. There are very few buildings left; for example, the Morgan Cottage is left along with the sewage plant. These buildings are abandoned but left in original condition. Many other buildings have been renovated for other uses as of July 2009. The site was redeveloped as a VA home, an industrial park, and a portion of the grounds is now the Manteno Municipal golf course. A state hospital cemetery is to the east of the site. The grounds are the now the home of numerous housing developments including a residential treatment center for males and females ages 12 to 21 called Indian Oaks Academy, which is a member of the Nexus family of treatment programs.Indian Oaks Academy See also *List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities *Jerome Y.

At Japanese weddings, funerals, miyamairi and other ceremonies at Shinto shrines, tamagushi are ritually presented to the kami (spirits or gods) by parishioners or kannushi priests. Linguistic history The Japanese word tamagushi is usually written with the kanji tama Áéâ \\"jade; gem; jewel; precious; ball; bead\\" and kushi ‰∏≤ \\"string together; skewer; spit; stick\\", or sometimes written Áéâ„Åê„Åó with hiragana since the official T≈çy≈ç kanji do not include ‰∏≤. The earliest recorded transcription of tamagushi is ÁéâÁ±§, using kuji Á±§ \\"bamboo slip; (divination) lot; written oracle; raffle; lottery\\" instead of kushi. The (ca. 720 CE) Nihon Shoki \\"Chronicles of Japan\\", which repeatedly mentions a 500-branched masakaki ÁúüÊ¶ä \\"true sakaki\\" tree (tr. Aston 1896:43, 47, 121), is the locus classicus for tamagushi ÁéâÁ±§. A kannushi holding a tamagushiThis mytho-history records a legend that when the sun-goddess Amaterasu got angry with her brother Susano'o and closed the door on the \\"Rock-cave of Heaven\\", the gods decorated a giant sakaki tree in order to lure the sun out of the darkness. > Then all the Gods were grieved at this, and forthwith caused Ama no nuka-do > no Kami, the ancestor of the Be [\\"clan; guild\\"] of mirror-makers, to make a > mirror, Futo-dama, the ancestor of the Imibe [weavers' clan], to make > offerings, and Toyo-tama, the ancestor of the Be of jewel-makers, to make > jewels. They also caused Yama-Tuschi [Mountain-god] to procure eighty > precious combs of the five-hundred-branched true sakaki tree, and Nu-dzuchi > [Moor-god] to procure eighty precious combs of the five-hundred-branched > Suzuki grass. (tr. Aston 1896:47) This \\"precious combs\\" translation derives from tama Áéâ (tr. \\"Toyo-tama\\" and \\"jewels\\") and kushi Ê´õ \\"comb\\", which is a Nihon Shoki graphic variant of kuji Á±§ in the goddess named Tamakushi Hime ÁéâÊ´õÂß´ (tr. \\"jewel-comb\\" Aston 1896:62). The (ca. 645-760 CE) Man'y≈çsh≈´ \\"Myriad Leaves Collection\\" does not use the word tamagushi but one poem (tr. Pierson 1929-1938:199) describes making it with paper mulberry: \\"I tie pure white strands of mulberry to the branches of the sacred tree\\". Some common tamagushi collocations include: *tamagushi o sasageru Áéâ‰∏≤„ÇíÊçß„Åí„Çã \\"offer a tamagushi\\" *tamagushi h≈çn≈ç Áéâ‰∏≤Â•âÁ¥ç \\"dedicate/offer tamagushi [in front of a shrine altar]\\" *tamagushi-ry≈ç Áéâ‰∏≤Êñô \\"[cash] offerings for tamagushi [presented at a shrine]\\" Tamagushi has an uncommon secondary meaning of \\"name for the sakaki tree\\". The (ca. 1439 CE) Shin Kokin Wakash≈´ \\"New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems\\" (tr. Carr 1995:8) contains the first occurrence, \\"Holding the ornamented tamagushi leaves\\". The sakaki (Cleyera japonica) is a flowering evergreen tree, which is considered sacred in Japanese mythology. In the present day, Shinto shrines often plant it as a sakaiki (Â¢ÉÊú® \\"boundary tree\\") to demarcate sanctified space. Sakaki is written with the kanji Ê¶ä, which graphically combines boku or ki Êú® \\"tree; wood\\" and shin or kami Á•û \\"spirit; god\\", compare Shinboku (Á•ûÊú® \\"sacred tree\\"). Carr (1995:11) characterizes Ê¶ä as \\"a doubly exceptional logograph\\"; it is an ideograph \\"character representing an idea\\" (which is an infrequent type of logograph \\"character representing a word\\", see Chinese character classification), and it is a kokuji ÂõΩÂ≠ó \\"national character; Japanese-made character\\" (rather than a typical kanji Êº¢Â≠ó \\"Chinese character\\" loanword). Etymology The etymology of tamagushi, like many Japanese words, is uncertain. Despite consensus that -gushi ‰∏≤ means \\"skewer; stick\\" (of sakaki), the original signification of tama- Áéâ \\"jade; jewel; ball\\" remain obscure. The Kokugaku scholar Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801) suggested an etymon of tamukegushi ÊâãÂêë„Åë‰∏≤ \\"hand-offered stick/skewer\\". The Shinto theologian Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843) proposed \\"bejeweled stick/skewer\\", with tama Áéâ referring to decorative \\"jewels\\" (cf. tama Áè† \\"jewel; pearl; bead\\"). The famous ethnologist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962) hypothesized \\"spiritual stick/skewer\\", with tama Áéâ meaning tama Èúä \\"spirit; soul\\" (believed to be shaped like a tama ÁêÉ \\"ball; sphere; globe\\"). The Ehime lawsuit Tamagushi was central to the \\"Ehime-ken Yasukuni jinjƒÅ tamagushi sosh≈ç\\" ÊÑõÂ™õÁúåÈùñÂõΩÁ•ûÁ§æÁéâ‰∏≤Ë®¥Ë®ü \\"Ehime Prefecture's Yasukuni Shrine tamagushi lawsuit\\" over the constitutional separation of state and religion (see Nelson 1999 or Morimura 2003 for details). Although Article 20 of the Constitution of Japan prohibits the state establishment of religion and Article 89 forbids expenditure of public money \\"for the use, benefit, or maintenance of any religious institution\\", the Ehime Governor officially paid for tamagushi-ry≈ç Áéâ‰∏≤Êñô \\"tamagushi offerings\\" presented at several Shinto shrines. In 1982, a group of prefectural residents sued his office for having misappropriated ¬• 166,000 (approximately US $1900) in public funds. On March 17, 1989, the Matsuyama District Court ruled the tamagushi offerings were unconstitutional and ordered the defendants to repay the prefecture. On May 12, 1992, the Takamatsu High Court overturned the Matsuyama decision, reasoning that the Shinto offerings were constitutionally allowed within the realm of \\"social protocol\\". On April 2, 1997, the Supreme Court of Japan overturned that decision and made a landmark ruling that tamagushi offerings were unconstitutional. The question of what constitutes support of State Shinto remains controversial. For instance, the reformist politician Ichir≈ç Ozawa disagrees with the court ruling. > There are some instances where the values specified in the constitution are > not in accord with the Japanese traditional culture. The Shinto rite of > worshipping one's ancestors is very different from the idea of religion in > the West. The 'Tamagushir≈ç Decision' of the Supreme Court against Ehime > Prefecture, which declared that making donations to purchase tamagushi was > against the Constitution based on the religious freedom of Article 20, would > not strike the Japanese (who believe in many gods) as anti-constitutional. > Perhaps it would be better to impose restrictions on religious freedom only > in order to suppress the development of state-sponsored religious fascism. > (2001:169) References *Aston, William George, tr. 1896.

He served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the Second District of Montana. Biography Riddick was born in Wells, Faribault County, Minnesota and was educated in the public schools in Michigan, He attended Albion College in Albion, Michigan and Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. His sister, Florence Riddick Boys (1873-1963), was a journalist, suffragist, and state official in Indiana. From 1899 to 1910, Riddick was editor of the Winamac Republican newspaper in Indiana. Following that he was a rancher and County Assessor of Fergus Co., Montana. In 1918, Montana's at-large congressional district, which elected two separate members, was abolished, and the 1st and 2nd districts were created in its place. One of the at-large representatives, John M. Evans, opted to run for re-election in the 1st district, while the other, Jeannette Rankin, instead opted to run for the Senate. Riddick ran in the newly created 2nd district, and was narrowly elected over Harry B. Mitchell, the Democratic nominee. He was re-elected in a landslide over M. McCusker in 1920. Rather than seek re-election to a third term, he opted to run for the United States Senate in 1922 to replace retiring Senator Henry L. Myers. Riddick won the Republican primary over State Attorney General Wellington D. Rankin, but in the general election, he lost to Burton K. Wheeler, the Democratic nominee, by a wide margin. After leaving politics, Riddick served as president of the National Republic, a magazine published in Washington, D.C. He was the operator of a home development at Sylvan Shores in South River, Maryland. In later years he lived in Maryland and Florida. His son, Merrill K. Riddick, ran for several offices in Montana as well as President. Death Riddick died on July 9, 1960 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He is interred at Hillcrest Memorial Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.

The Upper Guinean forests ecosystem, of which the Simandou Range forms part of, extends across southern Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, southern C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Ghana, and western Togo. It is believed to have once covered as much as , but over centuries of human activity, nearly 70 percent of the original forest cover has disappeared, leaving isolated patches of different forest types that host ecological communities of exceptional diversity and numerous endemic species. GDA (Global Development Alliance) Promotes Forest Conservation, Community Development, USAID Guinea, 20 April 2004, Accessed 11.12.2010 The variety of habitats found in the Simandou Range include humid Guinean savanna, Western Guinean lowland forest, montane and gallery forests, and the rare and endangered West African montane grassland habitat. The Pic de Fon forest at the southern end of the range is a relatively intact area of approximately 25,600 ha that contains many typical flora and fauna of the Guinean montane forests ecosystem, including endangered species such as the Nimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei), the West African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), the Diana monkey (Cercopithecus diana diana) and the Sierra Leone prinia (Schistolais leontica), a bird of the West African highlands known from only three other sites in the world. Frog Hylarana fonensis is known from nowhere else. The area has so far been protected by relative isolation but its biodiversity is now threatened by the encroachment of agriculture, illegal and unregulated bush meat hunting, logging, uncontrolled bush fires, road development, potentially destructive mining operations and human population growth. Government agencies' lack of capacity to enforce environmental legislation increases the threat. Land tenure conflicts and ecologically destructive subsistence farming practices (slash and burn agriculture), exacerbated by poverty, also pose problems for the environment. The range has two classified forests: Pic de Fon, designated in 1953, with an area of 256 km2, and Pic de Tib√©, designated in 1945, with an area of 60.75 km2.\\"2014 United Nations List of Protected areas of Guinea (data based on the WDPA October release)\\" Protected Planet.

Late 18th century written right-to-left. A zograscope is an optical device for magnifying flat pictures that also has the property of enhancing the sense of the depth shown in the picture. It consists of a large magnifying lens through which the picture is viewed. Devices containing only the lens are sometimes referred to as graphoscopes. Other models have the lens mounted on a stand in front of an angled mirror. This allows someone to sit at a table and to look through the lens at the picture flat on the table. Pictures viewed in this way need to be left-right reversed; this is obvious in the case of writing. A print made for this purpose, typically with extensive graphical projection perspective, is called a vue d'optique or \\"perspective view\\", Zograscopes were popular during the later half of the 18th century as parlour entertainments. Most existing ones from that time are fine furniture, with turned stands, mouldings, brass fittings, and fine finishes. According to Michael Quinion, the origin of the term is lost, but it is also known as a diagonal mirror, as an optical pillar machine, or as an optical diagonal machine.Worldwidewords.org In Japan, the zograscope became known as ÂíåËò≠ÁúºÈè° (Oranda megane, 'Dutch glasses') or Ë¶ó„ÅçÁúºÈè° (nozoki megane 'peeping glasses'), and the pictures were known as ÁúºÈè°Áµµ (megane-e, 'optique picture') Áπ∞Áµµ (karakuri-e 'tricky picture').

From around 1700 many of such \\"perspective boxes\\" or \\"optica\\" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives. *In 1730, the first zograscopes, then called \\"optiques\\", were developed in Paris. Many perspective views, mainly of scenes from France and Germany but some from England, were published.Court, T. H., & von Rorh, M. (1935). On old instruments both for the accurate drawing and the correct viewing of perspectives. The Photographic Journal, 75(February), 54-66. Retrieved from https://archive.rps.org/archive/volume-75/734093?q=rohr%201935> Optiques incorporated a mirror but lacked any simple means of varying the distance of the lens from the image. *In 1745, the first English versions of the devices began to appear and soon many perspective views were printed for it, mostly of views with urban architecture. The oldest known reference to the English device is found in an advertisement in an English newspaper from April 1746. The term optical diagonal machine dates from as early as 1750. Experience of zograscope viewing Zograscopes created an unprecedentedly realistic experience of depicted scenes, so much so that Blake (2003) described it as \\"virtual reality\\". A zograscope allowed viewers to move their eyes over very large scenes, yielding an immersive experience. Koenderink et al. (2013) showed that viewing photographs with a zograscope allowed observers to see depicted objects, such as Rodin's Danaid (Rodin), in objectively measured depth. Explanation Magnification of images was well understood by the time the first devices were constructed in the early 18th century. Basically, the image is placed at the focal point of a biconvex or plano-convex lens (a magnifying glass) allowing someone to view the magnified image at varying distances on the other side of the lens. Court and von Rorh (1935) suggested that the popularity of the early French models was because they allowed presbyopic purchasers to see the images clearly despite the French fashion against wearing glasses. But Chaldecott (1953) doubted this could have been the sole reason for the devices' enduring popularity, leaving the major factor to be the realistic appearance of the depicted images. A zograscope makes a realistic experience for someone looking through it is by enhancing depth perception. One way is by minimizing other depth cues that specify the flatness and pictorial nature of the picture. The image is magnified, perhaps giving it a visual angle similar to the real scene the picture is depicting. The edges of the picture are blocked by the frame of the lens. The light coming from the lens to the eye is collimated, preventing accommodation. In early prints of interior scenes, some objects were hand-tinted with saturated colors whereas the background was tinted with \\"a pale wash\\" exploiting color contrast as a depth cue. A second way a zograscope could enhance depth perception is by creating binocular stereopsis. Because each eye views the image from a different position, the surface of the picture could have binocular disparity from different magnification for the two eyes or from differences in the rotation of the images received by the eyes, so-called cyclodisparity. Such disparities create an overall slant of the picture surface around the vertical meridianOgle, K. N. (1950). Researchers in binocular vision. New York: Hafner Publishing Company. or horizontal meridian respectively. As well, coloured parts of the image will be refracted differently for each eye, creating a version of chromostereopsis. Even if the binocular disparity were incorrect for the surface of the image or any coloured parts of it, the stereoscopic information tends to integrate with the other depth information in the image. Construction of modern variation A simple zograscope can be built from a frame (by cutting a rectangular opening in the bottom of a cardboard box) and placing in the frame a large, magnifying, fresnel lens available from stationery stores. When this is placed over a computer monitor displaying a photograph of a natural scene, the depicted depth will be enhanced.

Girls' sports teams are often referred to as the \\"Lady Lions.\\" History In 1942, Miss Elizabeth Evans, director of the Department of Education for the New England Fellowship [of Evangelicals], presented a plan to the board of directors for the formation of evangelical Christian elementary and secondary schools in New England. The New England Association of Christian Schools (NEACS), incorporated in 1946, was begun as a result of that meeting. Ms. Evans' hope was to have a network of elementary schools in the Boston suburbs that would serve as feeder schools for a central high school in Boston. North Shore Christian School in Lynn, a school in Rumney, New Hampshire and several schools on the South Shore were part of this network. With the help of local evangelical leaders such as Harold John Ockenga and T. Leonard Lewis, President of Gordon College, Miss Evans proceeded with the plans to start a secondary school. Boston Christian High School opened in 1946 over a bowling alley on Huntington Avenue. The school quickly outgrew this space and Christian High School moved to Garden Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts to a school building formerly used by the Browne and Nichols School. Under the leadership of Miles Strodel, assistant headmaster, the board started to consider a move to Lexington, Massachusetts. A key concern in making this move was access to the MBTA so that teens who lived in Boston would be able to attend the school. After the move, the name was changed to Lexington Christian Academy. The academy has been fully accredited since 1967 by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. In the 1990s, a thorough curriculum review was undertaken. At that time AP courses were added. In order to implement the curriculum, updated facilities were needed. LCA has added new classrooms and a library, a new gym and athletic fields. Five science labs have been added, the last two through a generous gift from the Van Lunen Foundation.

The company sells products under the Oberto, Oberto Classics, Lowrey's Meat Snacks, Pacific Gold Beef Jerky and Cattleman's Cut brands. History Constantino Oberto founded the Oberto Sausage Company making and selling hand-made Italian sausage in Seattle, Washington, in 1918. Using Italian family recipes, he began making salami, coppacola and other sausages. On Labor Day 1943, Oberto died leaving his company and its two employees to his family. Art Oberto, Constantino's 16-year-old son, took over the company. He continued to run the company while completing his studies at West Seattle High School, resisting pressure to sell the business. By 1954, revenue had grown enough to begin construction on a new factory, completed the following year, with the help of a loan from the family of Oberto's new wife, Dorothy Vennetti. Oberto Brands continued to grow through the 1960s with the production of its flagship beef jerky product and introduction of the product at Safeway stores in 1967. Safeway was the first national grocery chain to carry Oberto Brands jerky. In 1990, Laura Oberto joined her father in a leadership role and became the co-chairman of the company. The following year, she took over as president of Oberto Brands. In 1994, Oberto Brands purchased Smoke Craft and Lowrey's meat snacks brands and facilities, both based in Albany, Oregon. The purchase added 200 employees to the company. In 1999, the company entered into a distribution partnership with the Frito-Lay company. In 2002, Oberto Brands purchased the Pacific Sun Industries which produced the Pacific Gold brand. In 2009, after slow sales, Oberto Brands ended the distribution deal with Frito-Lay and began distributing its own products. Shortly after the agreement was terminated, Oberto Brands named Tom Ennis CEO and president. The company adjusted the recipes for its flagship jerky products in 2012, removing corn syrup, preservatives, dextrose, and other artificial ingredients. In 2013, Oberto Brands opened a production and distribution center in Nashville, Tennessee. The factory added over 300 employees to the company's workforce. Ennis left the company in 2014 and Thomas Hernquist was named the CEO and president in January, 2015.

It was directed by Clark L. Paylow from a screenplay by Lewis Simeon and Jerrold I. Zinnamon. Ring of Terror stars George E. Mather as Lewis, with Austin Green and Esther Furst in supporting roles. Ring of Terror was poorly received by nearly every critic who reviewed it. Criticisms were directed at the pacing and the age of the actors, with many critics feeling it was unsuitable for them to play college students due to their age. The film was featured in the sixth episode of the second season of Mystery Science Theater 3000, along with the third chapter of the 1939 serial The Phantom Creeps.  Plot  Medical student Lewis Moffitt (George E. Mather) protects a secret fear of the dark, stemming from an ordeal as a child which involved a dead body that frightened him. Despite this, he acts indifferent during the first autopsy that he and his class witness, which has a positive effect on his courage. However, the autopsy provokes his soon- to-be frat brothers to come up with a strange induction practice, expecting it to go wrong. They task Lewis with finding and taking the ring of a deceased person, so he can be accepted into the fraternity. Ring of Terror is narrated by a graveyard keeper, who invites the audience to follow him while he attempts to find his missing cat. When he finds himself near a specific gravestone, he finds himself thinking about Lewis Moffitt and his ordeal.  Production  Ring of Terror was directed by Clark L. Paylow, from a screenplay by Lewis Simeon and Jerrold I. Zinnamon. Ring of Terror is Simeon and Zinnamon's only film credit. Ring of Terror features a musical score by James Cairncross. It is Cairncross' only credit in the entertainment industry. Cinematography was done by Brydon Baker, and the film was edited by Jodie Copelan. It was produced and released by Playstar.  Reception  Ring of Terror received generally negative reviews. A review in Fight Night on Channel 9: Saturday Night Horror Films on New York's WOR-TV, 1973-1987 by James Arena gave Ring of Terror a C, but noted that \\"it was just off-beat enough to hold my interest.\\" Ring of Terror was included in Steve Miller's 150 Movies You Should Die Before You See. Miller gave Ring of Terror five thumbs down. He especially criticized the fact that the actors cast as college students were far too old, noting that they were in their late 30s and early 40s. Michael Adams, in his book Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies: A Film Critic's Year-Long Quest to Find the Worst Movie Ever Made, reviewed Ring of Terror and found it to be dull and full of padding. Like Miller, he noted that the actors were far too old to play college students. He pointed out that lead George E. Mather was 42 when he filmed Ring of Terror. VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever called Ring of Terror a \\"cheaply made flop.\\"  Mystery Science Theater 3000  Ring of Terror was featured in a second season episode of the television comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000. It was the sixth episode of the season, and was first broadcast on Comedy Central on November 3, 1990. Due to the short running time of Ring of Terror, the third chapter of the 1939 serial The Phantom Creeps was played after Ring of Terror concluded. It was the final chapter of The Phantom Creeps to be featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  DVD releases  Ring of Terror has been released on DVD several times. On July 8, 2003, Alpha Video released Ring of Terror on a standalone DVD.

Jonson's text comments on significant recent developments in astronomy and journalism. The text of the masque was first published in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641. Astronomy The masque refers to the discoveries of features on the Moon made by contemporaneous astronomers -- Galileo Galilei most famous among them -- using the earliest telescopes.Jonson was writing even before the term \\"telescope\\" had come into use in English; he calls the instrument a \\"trunk,\\" or tube. Similarly, Thomas Tomkis calls the telescope a \\"perspicill\\" in his 1615 play Albumazar. Their observations of mountain ranges and other geographic and geological features on the Moon's surface was interpreted as equivalent to the discovery of a \\"new world\\" -- as in two later works by John Wilkins, The Discovery of a World in the Moon (1638) and A Discourse Concerning a New Planet (1640). Journalism Jonson combined these new discoveries, and this perception of a new frontier of knowledge, with the innovative contemporary climate in the dissemination of news. The later Jacobean era was the time when the first English-language newspapers and news agencies were coming into being. Jonson expressed his skeptical attitude toward these developments in several works written in this period, most notably in The Staple of News (1625), but also here in his 1620 masque. (Jonson even recast some of the masque's prose into verse for the play.) The show Jonson opens his masque with a conversation among two heralds, a printer, a chronicler, and a factor (a kind of columnist or correspondent). All are in some sense in the news business, though their approaches differ; the traditional heralds are startled by the capitalist assumptions of the printer, who asks them the cost-price of their news.Sanders, p. 126. The characters discuss a number of contemporary issues, culminating in the news from the Moon -- which allows for satire on a range of subjects. The Moon is described as \\"an earth inhabited...With navigable seas and rivers...forests, parks, coney-ground, meadow-pasture, what not?\\" With all the similarities between Earth and Moon, though, there are differences; the Moon's denizens have no spoken language, rather communicating by signs -- which renders all the lawyers mute. They also have no tailors; as a result, the lunar \\"self- lovers\\" have all died. This conversation climaxes in the anti-masque, which is a dance of \\"Volatees,\\" a race of lunar bird-men. The serious portion of the masque follows, in which the \\"scene opens\\" to disclose the principal masquers, led by Prince Charles, who descend, \\"shake off their icicles,\\" and dance, to the accompaniment of music and song. The masque also features the inevitable lavish praise of King James. The lunar bird-men derive from the True History of Lucian, perhaps through the medium of Rabelais' Pantagruel.Brown, p. 92. Modern music The modern composer Theodore Antoniou wrote incidental music for the masque; his score was premiered on 30 November 1978, at a performance in Athens, Greece.

Distribution The Pacific bluefin tuna is primarily found in the North Pacific, ranging from the East Asian coast to the western coast of North America. It is mainly a pelagic species found in temperate oceans, but it also ranges into the tropics and more coastal regions. It typically occurs from the surface to , but has been recorded as deep as . It spawns in the northwestern Philippine Sea (e.g., off Honshu, Okinawa and Taiwan) and in the Sea of Japan.Monterey Bay Aquarium. Pacific bluefin tuna. Accessed 30 December 2011 Some of these migrate to the East Pacific and return to the spawning grounds after a few years. It has been recorded more locally as a visitor to the Southern Hemisphere, including off Australia, New Zealand, Gulf of Papua and French Polynesia. The species is considered to consist of only one stock. Physiology At Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, Japan Thermoregulation Almost all fish are cold-blooded (ectothermic). However, tuna and mackerel sharks are warm-blooded: they can regulate their body temperature. Warm-blooded fish possess organs near their muscles called retia mirabilia that consist of a series of minute parallel veins and arteries that supply and drain the muscles. As the warmer blood in the veins returns to the gills for fresh oxygen it comes into close contact with cold, newly oxygenated blood in the arteries. The system acts as a counter-current heat exchanger and the heat from the blood in the veins is given up to the colder arterial blood rather than being lost at the gills. The net effect is less heat loss through the gills. Fish from warmer water elevate their temperature a few degrees whereas those from cold water may raise it as much as warmer than the surrounding sea. The tuna's ability to maintain body temperature has several definite advantages over other sea life. It need not limit its range according to water temperature, nor is it dominated by climatic changes. The additional heat supplied to the muscles is also advantageous because of the resulting extra power and speed. Life cycle Pacific bluefin tunas reach maturity at about 5 years of age, the generation length is estimated at 7‚Äì9 years and based on two separate sources the longevity is 15 years or 26 years. At maturity it is about long and weighs about . Individuals that are long are regularly seen, and the maximum reported is in length and in weight. Elsewhere, a mass of up to has been reported for the species.TAG Bluefin Science in the Pacific.

Large females can carry more eggs than small ones, and between 5 million and 25 million eggs have been reported. Pacific bluefins eat various small schooling squids and fishes, but have also been recorded taking sessile animals, pelagic red crabs and krill. Human interaction=Commercial fishery Santa Catalina in 1913 Pacific bluefin tuna support a large commercial fishery. Aquaculture Japan is both the biggest consumer and the leader in tuna farming research.Ito, Masami, \\"Does Japan's affair with tuna mean loving it to extinction?\\", Japan Times, August 31, 2010, p. 3. Kinki University of Japan first successfully farmed already-hatched bluefin tuna in 1979. In 2002, they succeeded in breeding them, and in 2007, the process was repeated for a third generation. This farm-raised tuna is now known as Kindai tuna. Kindai is a contraction of Kinki University (Kinki daigaku). Conservation Unlike the other bluefins (Atlantic and southern), the Pacific bluefin tuna was not considered threatened initially, resulting in a Least Concern rating in 2011. In 2014, it was found to be threatened and the status was upgraded to Vulnerable.Casey, M. (17 November 2014). Sushi eaters pushing Pacific bluefin tuna to brink of extinction. Retrieved 30 November 2014. Overfishing is occurring in the Pacific bluefin, but overall the stock was not yet believed to be in an overfished condition in 2011.Menashes, E.H. (2011).

According to stock assessments completed in 2011, 2014 and 2016 by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC), the present-day population is at just 2.6 percent of its historic levels.2016 ISC Report: http://isc.fra.go.jp/pdf/ISC16/ISC16_Annex_09_2016%20Pacific%20Bluefin%20Tuna%20Stock%20Assessment.pdf The overall fishing mortality rate for this species remains up to three times higher than is sustainable. In 2010, it was estimated that the complete spawning biomass was 40‚Äì60% of the historically observed spawning biomass. In 2000‚Äì2004, between 16,000 tonnes and 29,000 tonnes were caught per year. Its wide range and migratory behavior lead to some problems, since fisheries in the species are managed by several different Regional Fisheries Management Organisations that sometimes give conflicting advice. The IUCN have recommended that the responsibility is moved to a single organisation. Other recommendations include a substantial reduction of fishing of this species, especially juveniles. As much as 90% of the caught Pacific bluefins are juveniles. Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program have placed all bluefin tunas on the \\"Avoid\\" list,Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch.

Mercury levels Pacific bluefin flesh may contain levels of mercury or PCBs that are harmful to humans that consume it. A similar problem exists in other tuna species. Cuisine About 80% of the Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tunas are consumed in Japan, and tunas that are particularly suited for sashimi and sushi can reach very high prices. In Japan, some foods made available for the first time of the year are considered good luck, especially bluefin tuna. Winning these new year auctions is often used as a way to get publicity, which raises the prices considerably higher than their usual market value: on 5 January 2013, a Pacific bluefin tuna caught off northeastern Japan was sold in the first auction of the year at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo for a record 155.4 million yen (US$1.76 million) ‚Äì leading to record unit prices of US$3,603 per pound, or ¬•703,167 per kilogram.

Christianborg cross-roads shooting On 20 February 1948, Dr. Nkrumah and Dr. J. B. Danquah met and addressed World War II veterans who had been agitating for their end-of-service benefits following World War II at the Palladium Cinema, Accra. These veterans had fought with the Gold Coast Regiment of the Royal West African Frontier Force and had not been paid their gratuities on their return home. Nkrumah and Danquah both gave their support and encouraged the veterans in their protest over their post-war neglect. On 28 February, what became known as the \\"Christianborg Cross-Roads shooting\\" occurred. Some Second World War veterans marched to the Christianborg Castle, the seat of the colonial government. They intended submitting a petition to the Governor, Sir Gerald Creasy about their poor conditions, unpaid war benefits and neglect. Police Superintendent Colin Imray, a British police officer, ordered the veterans to disperse, but they refused. He then ordered his men to open fire on the unarmed soldiers and, when they refused, opened fire himself killing three of them namely, Sergeant Cornelius Frederick Adjetey, Private Odartey Lamptey and Corporal Attipoe. This led to another round of riots and looting in Accra during which foreign (European and Asian) stores were looted. The riots lasted for five days.

It was built between 1427 and 1430 on the order of Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, the ruler of the Serbian Despotate. It was further fortified by the Ottoman Empire, which had taken the city in 1459. The fortress withstood several sieges by Ottomans and Serbs, surviving relatively unscathed. During World War II it was heavily damaged, by explosions and bombing. As of 2009 it is in the midst of extensive restoration and conservation work, despite which the fortress remains \\"one of the rare preserved courts of medieval Serbian rulers.\\" Smederevo Fortress was declared a national Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979. In 2010, the fortress was placed on the tentative list for possible nomination as a World Heritage Site (UNESCO). Location Smederevo Fortress, 45 kilometers southeast of Belgrade, covers 11.3 hectares in the center of the modern-day city of Smederevo. It is strategically located on the right bank of the Danube river on the triangular plain formed by the confluence of the Danube and Jezava rivers, only 72 meters above sea level. This location allowed the Serbian capital to remain near the Christian Kingdom of Hungary, while also satisfying Sultan Murad II of the Ottoman Empire by eliminating the uncontrolled passage of the Hungarians into the Morava Valley. (Excerpt from Smederevo 1430‚Äì1930 by Ljubomir Petroviƒá.) The fortress' position connecting the Balkans and Central Europe has made it an important religious and commercial center for centuries, now aided by being on the Pan-European X corridor. (A reprint of the specific section may be found here.) The Danube also connects it to many other historic sites, most notably Belgrade and its suburb of Vinƒça, Novi Sad, Golubac Fortress, Lepenski Vir and Viminacium. History Inner city southern walls and water trench (10) Despot's Palace remains (18) Amidst the turbulence of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the early 15th century, the region's Christian rulers lost several battles, such as the Battle of Kosovo and the siege of Veliko Tarnovo. Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá had to maintain the Serbian Despotate in a delicate balance between the Ottomans and Hungarians. Around 1403, he accepted the Hungarian vassalage from King Sigismund and established the new capital in Belgrade, which was ceded to him as an award. After Stefan's death in 1426, ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, Stefan's nephew and successor, had to return Belgrade to the Hungarians. To compensate for this loss, ƒêuraƒë decided to build a new capital, and the choice fell to Smederevo. Smederevo, which had no prior settlement, was chosen for several reasons. In 1428, during the Ottoman Empire's war with Venice, the Hungarians and Ottomans agreed to recognize Brankoviƒá as an independent ruler of Serbia, thereby turning it into a buffer state. A contract also established Ottoman overlordship of Serbia, in conjunction with remaining a Hungarian vassal. Between the longer status with Hungary and religious differences with the Ottomans (Hungary and Serbia were Christian, as compared to the Muslim Turks), it was preferred that the capital be closer to Hungary than the Ottoman Empire. Smederevo's location on the Danube, between Belgrade and Golubac, provided easy access to other points along the river. It also allowed the control of Danube traffic, including blocking Hungarian entry into the Morava valley, which satisfied the Turks. In the fall of 1428, construction of the capital began. In 1430, the first part of the fortress, including a palace and enough other buildings to form an inner city, was completed. Work on a fortified suburb and additional fortifications continued until 1439. On April 20, 1434, ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá's youngest daughter Katarina and Ulrich II of Celje were wed in the new fortress. This marriage stressed the friendly relations the Despot had with the Ottoman Porte, although Ulrich's kinship with the Queen of Hungary implied an increased Serbo-Hungarian alliance. As a result, Vizier Mehmet Sarid≈æe- pasha arrived in Smederevo in mid-1434 with a message from Edirne. It stated that Serbia's safety from the Ottoman Empire could only be guaranteed through the marriage of Brankoviƒá's older daughter to Sultan Murad II. After much deliberation, the council convoked at the palace conceded, and arrangements were made for Mara to be engaged to the Sultan. That autumn, Murad sent several of his \\"most famous viziers\\" to retrieve his fianc√©e. On August 14, 1435, a formal contract of \\"brotherhood and friendship\\" between Serbia and the Republic of Venice was signed in Smederevo's audience hall.From \\"Pod vla≈°ƒáu proklete Jerina\\": \\"... in curia sine [sic] palatio residentie apud Semedram in sala mogna audientie.\\" This contract resulted in ƒêuraƒë and his sons being counted as Venetian citizens. In early June 1439, the peace with the Ottomans, which had been gained through Mara's marriage to the Sultan, was broken. Led by Murad II, 130,000 Turkish soldiers occupied the hills around Smederevo. Brankoviƒá rushed to Hungary for help, leaving his son Grgur in command. Help was not forthcoming, but Smederevo withstood the attack, even when Murad brought in cannons. A view to the northern wall and Danube. Nearly three months later, on August 18, 1439, hunger forced the Serbs to surrender. Princes Grgur and Stefan were sent to Anatolia and blinded, despite the pleas of their sister, now Sultana Mara. Five years later, however, Smederevo, Grgur, and Stefan returned to Brankoviƒá through the Peace of Szeged. Smederevo Fortress shortly before the explosion in 1941 Around the beginning of 1449, Brankoviƒá imprisoned Hungarian regent John Hunyadi in the dungeons of the fortress until he was ransomed by his countrymen. In 1453, Sultan Mehmed II and Isak-bey Arbanazoviƒá led another attack on Smederevo as part of a devastating raid on Serbia. The Turks took 50,000 men, women and children during that raid, but Smederevo was well-led by Thomas Kantakouzenos. Despite having only 6,000 men, compared to the Ottomans' 20,000, the city withstood. Mehmed the Conqueror besieged Smederevo for the second time and the fortress was besieged by the Ottomans for the third time in 1456, being defended by Serbian forces. In March 1459, Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá took over command of Smederevo Fortress. In 1459, Smederevo was captured by the Ottomans, leading to the end of the medieval Serbian state while Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá flead to Bosnia John V. A. Fine, John Van Antwerp Fine; (1994) The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest p. 575; University of Michigan Press, During World War II, German forces used the fortress for ammunition storage. On June 5, 1941, the ammunition exploded, blasting through the entirety of Smederevo and reaching settlements as far as 10 kilometers away. Much of the southern wall of the fortress was destroyed, the nearby railway station, packed with people, was blown away, and most of the buildings in the city were turned into debris. Around 2,500 people died in the explosion, and every other inhabitant was injured or wounded (approximately 5,500). Bombing by the Allies in 1944 caused further damage. Current and future use The fortress is currently used as a city park, and occasionally hosts festivals, concerts, fairs, and other cultural events. A stage has been built in the inner city. To the southeast, the previously open space along the Jezava now has a harbor and a marina. There are also discussions underway to determine compatible future, modernized uses, and to develop projects to restore and rehabilitate the fortress. Panoramic view of the Small Town (inner city) Panoramic view of the Big Town Cultural and historical significance Smederevo Fortress - 1920s Smederevo Fortress has been described as \\"one of the most striking and monumental pieces of architecture surviving from medieval Serbia\\", and \\"the witness of Serbian creative force.\\" It is an accurate display of traditional medieval defensive architecture and has remained well preserved, suffering no major deterioration until World War II. The fortress and surrounding area have accumulated evidence of the civilizations that developed throughout history, mainly between the 15th and 20th centuries, providing a direct testimony for the progress of the medieval Serbian state and corresponding Orthodox Church. One of the fortress' double-arched windows. The fortress was built by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá as the new capital of Serbia. During construction, Brankoviƒá's wife Jerina was seen speaking with the foreign overseers--her brother George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos and his men--which resulted in her being commonly associated with the project. Among the workers, this association, coupled with required long-term labor and high taxes, gained her the nickname \\"Prokleta Jerina\\" (\\"Damned Jerina\\"). The amount of effort exerted also produced a variety of exaggerations and stories, such as the epic poem \\"Starina Novak i knez Bogosav\\" (\\"Elder Novak and Count Bogosav\\"), which stated that many people fled to the woods and became hajduci in order to escape taxes and further work. While there were in fact hajduci in the area, it is unclear whether they were actually related to the fortress' construction. Once the first part was completed, Smederevo Fortress quickly became an important connection between the Balkans and central Europe. Shortly after it was built, the city reached its peak importance as a religious, commercial, and trade center, at which point it was populated mainly by Serbs and colonies of merchants, primarily from Dubrovnik. Around the same time, the relics of Saint Luke the Evangelist, who became the patron saint of Smederevo, were brought and stored in the church in the fortress. In relation to the structure itself, the inner city is notable for the audience hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture. High in the stone wall on the Danube side, four sets of double-arched windows are carved in a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles. This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed. The Despot's inscription tower. There is also a tower in the inner city with a large brick inscription naming ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and stating the date of construction. It reads \\"V Hrista Boga blagoverni despot ƒêurƒë, gospodin Srbljem i Pomorju Ze(t)skomu; povelenijem jego sazida se grad sij v leto 6938.\\" (\\"In Christ the Lord faithful Despot ƒêurƒë, Lord of Serbs and the Littoral of Zeta. By His order this city was built in the year of 6938 [1430]\\".)Tvrƒëava - Prestoni grad www.smederevo.org.rs Above it is an immured cross, which gives the tower its names \\"Krstata kula\\" (\\"Krstata tower\\") and tower \\"Krstaƒça\\". This type of inscription is rare, and found only on former Byzantine territory. It is the sole example in the former Yugoslavia. In the fortified suburb are the minimal remains of two more significant structures. One was a sacral complex, Blagove≈°tenjska crkva (Annunciation Church), where the Saint's relics were stored. Though its construction began in the 15th century, it was built over several historical phases. The second structure was a Turkish bath from the 17th century. For years, Smederevo Fortress stood as the last defense against Ottoman assaults. During their attack in 1439, it also became the first site in Serbia to see cannon fire. When it fell in 1459, it became the center of a Turkish sanjak. Later, Smederevo was a province of the Habsburg Monarchy, and between 1805 and 1807 it was once again the center of the renewed Serbian state.

Church remains Smederevo Fortress is a monumental complex built in the Byzantine tradition and modeled after Constantinople fortress. Although its foundations were not intended to be submerged, it is classed as a water fortress because it is completely surrounded by water. After the fortress' completion, there was a decline in its military importance and few structural changes were made. As a result, the original architectural style has been preserved to this day. The fortress is encircled by 1.5 kilometers of crenelated walls over 2 meters thick, and 25 towers which are each approximately 25 meters tall. Two sides were bordered by the Danube and Jezava rivers, though the Jezava has now been redirected away from the wall. The third side had two moats added to the defensive system, one for the inner city and one for the suburb. The area south of the outer walls was left open. Construction There were four main phases in the construction of the fortress. The work on the first part, a fortified manor for Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá built at the confluence of the rivers, began in the autumn of 1428. Under the eye of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, older brother of Despotina Jerina Brankoviƒá, lumber, lime, and enormous stones from the former Roman cities of Mons Aureus (the modern village of Seone, west of Smederevo (The map near the bottom shows Seone to the west of Smederevo)), Margum (at the mouth of the Great Morava), and Viminacium were collected. In the spring of 1429, Greek and Ragusan workers began the brickwork. In 1430, the elegant manor was completed. It included a palace stretching along the length of the moat wall; a throne hall against the Danube wall; a keep, Don≈æon kula (Donjon tower), in the corner formed by the walls; a treasury in a high chamber; and other auxiliary buildings, creating an inner city. A view to the Danube from an inner city tower The throne hall, where Brankoviƒá received his visitors, was built with four double-arched windows, fashioned in a mixed Gothic/Romanesque style. Don≈æon kula was intended to be the final line of defense. It was constructed with walls over 4 meters thick, and housed the nobility during Turkish attacks. Hidden doors were built into the Jezava wall, allowing for passage towards Hungary. The next nine years were spent expanding the fortifications to include a larger fortified suburb, thereby finishing the main fortress. In the suburb, a sacral complex was built in phases from the 15th century onwards, and a Turkish bath was added by the Ottomans in the 17th century. There was a ship gate in the suburb's Danube wall, where sailors could enter the fortress. It is unclear whether any long-term residential buildings were built. Between 1460 and 1480, while held by the Ottoman Empire, a larger defensive system was built, including escarpments, low walls, and more towers. During the first half of the 18th century, fortified trenches were added. Current condition The state of deterioration of the fortress ranges widely, from krstata kula which is still well preserved, to sections of the walls which have seen no repair work and have collapsed in some places. The southwestern wall of the fortified suburb The first, and most severe, damage happened during World War II. On June 5, 1941, ammunition stored in the fortress exploded, destroying not only a large part of the southern wall, but also decimating most of Smederevo. Further damage was caused by the Allies' bombing in 1944. A dam in the Iron Gate, completed in 1972, raised the water level of the lower Danube basin and caused significant flooding. Between 1970 and 1980, a system was built to protect the fortress and surrounding city from future high water, however there was once again major flooding in 2006, a result of heavy rainfall and melting snow. The fortress has been the focus of restoration and conservation efforts, followed by archaeological and architectural research, since at least 1970. The majority of work so far was done between 1970 and 1995. While some parts were at least partially repaired, others only received conservation work and are still in bad condition. In the inner city, the foundation is the only part of the palace which remains standing, and the audience hall has only an outline where the base was. What remains has been partially restored and is now stable, though issues of vegetation growth and permanent maintenance remain. The surrounding towers also still need work, as many have collapsed. The town's restoration was followed in 1994‚Äì1995 with an archaeological investigation. The southeastern wall of the fortified suburb The fortified suburb is still in very bad condition. Parts of the wall are missing and several towers are leaning or partially collapsed. The corner tower behind the Turkish inscription tower, and the stretch of wall along the Danube have seen conservation efforts, and the southern wall, which has been restored several times as part of a levee, is stable, but the conservation work is of poor quality. Much of the time has instead been spent on archaeological excavations and research, especially of the remains of the sacral complex and Turkish bath. The escarpment along the Danube, which had partially collapsed several times, has seen restoration work, and is now in good condition. On the other sides, much of the escarpment is gone or underground, and the overall condition is unknown. The ambiance and setting are also threatened, though they remain the best along the Danube. The other two sides are surrounded by modern development, such as a marina on the eastern side, a railway to the south, and a variety of other urban structures. The planned final result of the work is for full rehabilitation of both Smederevo Fortress and its immediate surroundings, including relocating the railroad, though estimations of cost vary widely. Between 2003 and 2004, the cost for just the conservation work was estimated to be ‚Ç¨10,600,000, while the total rehabilitation cost, including conservation, restoration, and research, reached as high as ‚Ç¨22,000,000. In 2005, the combined cost for basic conservation and research dropped to ‚Ç¨4,000,000. Ongoing risk factors Despite conservation efforts, the fortress is still at risk of damage, for reasons, both natural and man-made. The higher groundwater level resulting from the dam in the Iron Gate threatens its stability, and has increased the number of floods, especially before the coast was consolidated. Air pollution and vegetation growth are increasing the rate of decay. Urban encroachment, especially by the railroad, continues to threaten the character of the area surrounding the fortress. Unrestricted visits by tourists, combined with inadequate protection, maintenance, and support, both administrative and financial, also contribute to the slow deterioration of the fortress.

In 1992, Genoud told a London newspaper \\"My views have not changed since I was a young man. Hitler was a great leader, and if he had won the war the world would be a better place today.\\" Early life Genoud was from Lausanne, Switzerland. He met Adolf Hitler in 1932 as a teenager in a hotel while studying in Bonn.Wyden, Peter (2001) The Hitler Virus: The Insidious Legacy of Adolf Hitler. Arcade Publishing. pp.111-12. , He joined the pro- Nazi National Front in 1934, and two years later he traveled to Palestine where he met the grand mufti of Jerusalem, Amin el-Husseini. Working for both Swiss and German intelligence agencies, Genoud traveled extensively in the Middle East. World War II Genoud traveled to Berlin frequently during the war \\"to see his friend the grand mufti,\\" and visited him afterward many times in Beirut. The grand mufti allegedly \\"entrusted Genoud with the management of his enormous financial affairs\\". In 1940, together with a Lebanese national, he set up the Oasis nightclub in Lausanne to serve as a covert operation for the Abwehr. In 1941, Abwehr agent Paul Dickopf sent Genoud into Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Belgium. Genoud befriended several top Nazis, including Karl Wolff, \\"supreme SS and police leader\\" in Italy. At the end of the war, Genoud represented the Swiss Red Cross in Brussels. Post-war Genoud is notable for having been the executor of last will and testament of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, and for reportedly making a fortune from publishing Goebbels' diaries which he held the posthumous rights for along with Hitler and Bormann's works.https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2015/11/the_german_menace_of_islamofascism.html This enterprise suffered a setback in 1960 when Paula Hitler died without his securing the full rights to the literary works of Adolf Hitler.Harris, Robert (1996) Selling Hitler: The Story of the Hitler Diaries.

Algerian Liberation Front While in Egypt in the 1950s, through contacts in Gamal Abdel Nasser's government, he was introduced to the leaders of the Algerian Liberation Front, which he would eventually finance by 1954 after originally supplying weapons. In 1958 he founded the Arab Commercial Bank, which would be active in lending to Arab nationalist groups and as the chief repository for the Algerian National Liberation Front. Palestine In the 1960s Genoud began supplying arms for Palestinian causes. The Lausanne-based New European Order organisation, met in Barcelona in April 1969 where Palestinian groups received financial support and Genoud placed them in contact with former Nazis who would assist their military training, including pledged support designated for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. He was a close associate of Dr. George Habash and Jacques Verg√®s, and in September 1969 he contributed finances for the legal expenses of three Palestinians from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine following their attack on an El Al flight in Zurich, where he personally sat at their defense table.

She is best known for the paintings of horses in military service she produced during World War One and for her illustrations to the 1915 edition of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty. Biography=Early life Lucy Kemp-Welch was born in Bournemouth, the first child of solicitor Edwin Buckland Kemp-Welch. She showed an early excellence in art and exhibited for the first time when she was 14 years old. After attending a local art school, in 1891 she and her younger sister Edith moved to Bushey to study at Hubert von Herkomer‚Äôs art school. As one of Herkomer's best and most favoured students, she was able to set up her own studio, in an old former inn known as 'Kingsley'. In due course Kemp-Welch took over the running of the Herkomer School in 1905 and ran it until 1926, first as the Bushey School of Painting and then, after relocating it to her own home, as the Kemp-Welch School of Animal Painting. After 1928 the school was run by Kemp-Welch's former assistant Marguerite Frobisher as the Frobisher School of Art. While still a student Kemp-Welch had a painting, Gypsy Drovers taking Horses to a Fair shown at the Royal Academy in 1895. Kemp-Welch received further public recognition in 1897 when her painting Colt- Hunting in the New Forest was also shown at the Royal Academy. The painting was purchased by the Chantrey Bequest for 500 guineas, and is now in the British national collection at the Tate. In total, throughout her career Kemp- Welch had 61 paintings displayed at the Royal Academy. In 1914 Kemp-Welch became president of the Society of Animal Painters. In 1915 she provided illustrations to an edition of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and used Robert Baden-Powell's horse Black Prince as a model. She had previously illustrated Round About, A Brighton Coach Office by M E King in 1896 and The Marking of Mathias in 1897. As well as pictures of horses, Kemp-Welch painted other animals, flowers and landscapes. She also painted at least two Boer War scenes, In Sight':Lord Dundonald's dash on Ladysmith, 1901, (Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter), and Sons of the City (private collection). Both of these featured horses in military action and led to several significant commissions for her during World War One. World War One Artwork for Forward! Forward to Victory Enlist Now (1914) The Straw Ride- Russley Park Remount Dep't, Wiltshire (Art.IWM ART3160) In December 1914, Kemp-Welch was engaged by the British Parliamentary Recruiting Committee to paint the artwork for the famous army recruitment poster, Forward! Forward to Victory Enlist Now which she signed, 'L.K.W 1914.' During World War One women were employed at Army Remount Depots in training and preparing horses for military service. Kemp-Welch was commissioned by the Women's Work Section of the Imperial War Museum to paint a scene at the largest such depot, one staffed entirely by women, at Russley Park in Wiltshire. The Museum authorities were unhappy with the painting, The Ladies Army Remount Depot, Russley Park, Wiltshire which Kemp-Welch first submitted but were aware of a larger and much better composition on the same subject that she had painted and intended to sell to a private client for ¬£1,000. Kemp-Welch agreed that the second painting, The Straw-Ride- Russley Park, Remount Dep't Wiltshire was the better of the two and agreed to sell it to the IWM to forefill her commission. However she was unable to agree a fee with the Women's Work Section and after protracted discussions, donated it free of charge to the Museum. In 1916 Kemp-Welch sought and was given permission to visit the Royal Field Artillery camp at Bulford on Salisbury Plain. The officer in command of the camp allowed Kemp- Welch to set up an easel while eight batteries of horse artillery were continually ridden towards her so she could sketch the horse teams in movement at close quarters. These sketches resulted in two large works, The Leaders of a Heavy Gun Team, now in the Royal Artillery Institution, and Forward the Horses. These paintings were shown at the Royal Academy in 1917 and Forward the Horses was purchased by the Chantrey Bequest for the Tate. Although popular images at the time, these painting are not without their critics as they provided a heroic view of warfare but one at odds with the reduced role of horse artillery in an increasingly mechanised conflict. As well as Bulford Camp, Kemp-Welch also made studies at several other Royal Artillery camps, notably several in Hampshire near Winchester. The resulting pictures included Big Guns to the Front, an image of shire horses pulling guns through a snowy landscape, which was shown to great acclaim at the Royal Academy in 1918 and was purchased for the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff in 1921. Later life The Ladies' Army Remount Dep't, Russley Park, Wiltshire, (1918) (Art.IWM ART 3094) In 1924, for the Royal Exchange, Kemp-Welch designed and completed a large panel commemorating the work of women during World War One. From 1926 onwards she focussed on depicting scenes of gypsy and circus life and spent several summers following Sanger's Circus, recording the horses. She resided in Bushey, Hertfordshire for most of her life and a major collection of her works is in Bushey Museum. They include very large paintings of wild ponies on Exmoor, galloping polo ponies, the last horse-launched lifeboat being pulled into a boiling sea, heavy working horses pulling felled timber and hard-working farm horses trudging home at the end of the day. The Lucy Kemp-Welch estate has been represented by Messum's Fine Art since 1975. Her younger sister Edith, who died in 1941, was also an artist as was her cousin Margaret Kemp-Welch (1874-1968). Like her sister, Edith Kemp-Welch also produced a poster for the British war effort, an image of Britannia with the slogan \\"Remember Scarborough\\". ReferencesFurther reading *Harrington, P.

Biography Sotiropoulos was born in Nafplio in 1831. He went to Athens to study law at the University of Athens, but was forced to interrupt his studies due to illness. Instead he turned to his other passion, Economics. In 1853 he was accepted as a tax inspector in the Ministry of Finances, and served in this capacity in various provincial towns. His rise was quick: by 1856 he was department head and soon after general secretary of the Customs Department. From this position he reformed the Customs service and wrote a new set of regulations for it, and suggested other reforms such as the abolition of the tithe. For his services, King Otto awarded him the Silver Cross of the Order of the Redeemer. Following the ousting of Otto in 1862, Sotiropoulos entered politics, and was elected as a representative for Triphylia in the II National Assembly of 1862‚Äì64. He served as Finance Minister in the 1864‚Äì65 Constantine Kanaris cabinet, and was then nominated for president of the Court of Audit, but refused the post and instead focused on his parliamentary career: he was almost repeatedly re-elected from 1865 to 1895. A supporter of Alexandros Koumoundouros, after the latter's death in 1883 he served as an independent, criticizing both Charilaos Trikoupis and Theodoros Deligiannis, the two dominant and rival figures of Greek politics after Koumoundouros' death. In the 1887 elections he even led his own group of nine MPs. During this time, he was elected twice Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament, in 1878‚Äì79 and 1879‚Äì80, and served as Finance Minister in virtually all of Koumoundouros' cabinets (1865, 1870‚Äì71, 1875‚Äì76, 1880‚Äì82) as well as Justice Minister in 1880. His tenure in the Finance Ministry was marked by his personal integrity, a fight against corruption and mismanagement, and an effort to reduce spending and increase revenue. In May 1893, after the resignation of Trikoupis due to the country's impending default, Sotiropoulos was tapped by King George I to form a government as Prime Minister in co-operation with Dimitrios Rallis. Sotiropoulos held the Finance Ministry as well in this cabinet, but it proved shot-lived as he was forced to resign a few months later. Sotiropoulos died in Athens in 1898. Writings In 1866, Sotiropoulos was kidnapped and held by brigands for 36 days before he was ransomed for 60,000 drachmas.

MOEMS includes a wide variety of devices, for example optical switch, optical cross-connect, tunable VCSEL, microbolometers. These devices are usually fabricated using micro-optics and standard micromachining technologies using materials like silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and gallium arsenide. Merging technologies This figure first was introduced by M. Edward Motamedi digital micromirror showing the mirror mounted on the suspended yoke with the torsion spring running bottom left to top right (light grey), with the electrostatic pads of the memory cells below (top left and bottom right) DLP CINEMA. A Texas Instruments Technology MOEMS includes two major technologies, microelectromechanical systems and micro- optics. Both these two technologies independently involve in batch processing similar to integrated circuits, and micromachining similar to fabrication of microsensor. MEMS offers inherently device miniaturization and wide applications in sensors and actuators, robotics, accelerometers, microvalves, flow controllers, global positioning systems (GPS) component miniaturization; and a host of other sensors and actuators for applications to space, air, land, and sea vehicles, as well as industrial, biotechnology, and consumer electronics During the 1980s the acronym of MEMS created a fortune for publication, getting government contracts and publicity. DARPA assigned a program manager for this field and significantly soon MEMS is promoted to be the king of the technology. Several high tech journals that were originated were attached to MEMS by supporting miniaturization and low cost manufacturing. Many private companies which did not have sufficient knowledge about MEMS also started jumping on the bandwagon. Parallel with MEMS developments and even earlier, sensor technology advanced to microsensors and joining with microactuators. Development of microsensors and microactuators were also due to a mother technology of micromachining. Micromachining is the root of everything we have today in high technology. This technology was never credited in history as it deserved. It was commercially used during the 1960s in Switzerland, for micromachining quartz orders of magnitudes harder than micromachining silicon. MEMS acronym was so powerful during the 1980s, that with no choice microsensors and microactuators that included micromachining, all joined MEMS by a soft landing. As a result, the MEMS acronym was more attractive for publicity and even today is dominating in microtechnologies without giving credit to its real parents. During the MEMS era, and before that time frame, Rockwell International was involved in commercial MEMS development under government contracts. During early 1980s Rockwell successfully built the first CMOS MEMS high performance and high G accelerometer chip for space applications.M. E. Motamedi, \\" Acoustic Accelerometers \\", IEEE Trans. on Ultrasonic‚Äôs, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, Vol. UFFC-34, No. 2, P. 237, March 1988 The wafer was processed inside Rockwell VLSI lab in Anaheim, CA. This was a breakthrough in MEMS technology, but it did not appear in the literature until 1988. During 1992, Rockwell applied micro-optics to the system development of several industrial applications, including, microlenses for silicon focal planes,M.E.

(invited paper) Rockwell Science Center also developed refractive microlens technology, including gray scale photolithography.H.O. Sankur, et al, Fabrication of IR microlens arrays by reactive ion milling,‚Äù SPIE Proceeding of Miniature and Micro-optics and Micromechanics, 2687, pp 150-155, 1996 Diffractive microlenses based on binary optic structures are typically fabricated in bulk material by multiple sequential layers of photoresist patterning and reactive ion etching (RIE), to form a multi-step phase profile. This profile approximates the ideal kinoform lens surface. A special staircase process, called binary optics, is used to fabricate diffractive components. With so many successes in micro-optics and MEMS, Rockwell researchers who were involved in both MEMS and micro-optics, initiate development of several of innovative photonics ideas combining both technologies. MOEMS is a promising multi technology for miniaturization of critical optical systems. The acronym is defined of three high tech fields of micro-optics, micromechanics, and microelectronics. MOEMS indirectly could merge in micromachining, microsensors and microactuators if their processes are compatible with integrated circuits. Merging all these multi technologies made MOEMS an ideal know-how for many industrial demonstrations of commercial devices, such as optical switches, digital micromirror devices (see DLP), bistable mirrors, laser scanners, optical shutters, and dynamic micromirror displays. All technologies of MOEMS have the potential of batch processing and embossed replication which, again, makes them highly attractive and necessary for commercial applications. MOEMS is an enabling technology for applications that cannot be addressed, using micro-optics alone and is currently playing a significant role in numerous optical applications. The trend toward miniaturization and integration of conventional optical systems will accelerate the adoption of MOEMS technology in commercialization of many industrial components which are today‚Äôs most desirable elements of optical communication. History of MOEMS During 1991-1993, Dr. M. Edward Motamedi, a former Rockwell International innovator in the areas of both microelectromechanical systems and micro-optics, used internally the acronym of MOEMS for microoptoelectromechanical systems. This was to distinguish between optical MEMS and MOEMS, where optical MEMS could include bulk optics but MOEMS is truly based on microtechnology where MOEMS devices are batch-processed exactly like integrated circuits, but this is not true in most cases for optical MEMS. In 1993, Dr. Motamedi officially introduced MOEMS for the first time, as the powerful combination of MEMS and micro-optics, in an invited talk at the SPIE Critical Reviews of Optical Science and Technology conference in San Diego. In this talk Dr. Motamedi introduced the figure below, for showing that MOEMS is the interaction of three major microtechnologies; namely micro-optics, micromechanics, and microelectronics.M. E.

Description Beginning at its southern end where the Bowery crosses East 4th Street, the road then splits in two, both with Cooper Square addresses, until they cross Astor Place between East 8th Street and St. Marks Place and become Fourth Avenue (the western street) and Third Avenue (the eastern street).New York City Department of Transportation \\"Bowery - Houston - Bleecker Transportation Study (Congestion Analysis) p.4-2 \\"Third and Fourth Avenues converge at Cooper Square to become Bowery...\\"Rosenberg, Andrew and Dunford, Martin.

It was renamed for Peter Cooper, the 19th Century industrialist and philanthropist, after his death in 1883.\\"S\\" on Old Streets of New York] In 1853, Cooper had broken ground for Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, an institution founded on the belief that high-quality education should be available to all who qualified, including women - a radical notion at the time - without cost. It continued to provide every student with a full-tuition scholarship until 2014. Frederick A. Peterson's Cooper Union Foundation Building on the north end of the square, the oldest existing American building framed with steel beams,Actually, steel railroad tracks used as beams. still stands where it was located when it opened in 1859, but the interior was extensively reconstructed in 1975 not only to modernize it, but also to fulfill one of Cooper's plans which was never realized at the time: the installation of a round elevator. The exterior of the building was restored in 1999 as well. Downtown of the Foundation Building is a small park, Cooper Triangle, which includes a monument dedicated to Peter Cooper. Across the street, at 41 Cooper Square, is the school's newest building, the New Academic Building, designed by Thom Mayne of Morphosis. The Village Voice's headquarters are on the western side of the square, as are classroom buildings of Grace Church School and Kaplan, Inc. The sleek, modern high-rise Cooper Square Hotel at 25 is one of the newest buildings on the square.\\"The Story\\" at the Cooper Square Hotel website\\"Cooper Square Hotel\\" coverage at Curbed The New York City Department of Transportation's \\"Reconstruction of Astor Place and Cooper Square\\" plan\\"Reconstruction of Astor Place and Cooper Square\\" New York City Department of Transportation (January 6, 2011) calls for some changes to be made to Cooper Square beginning in 2013. The western leg of the square will be a northbound bus-only lane, from a two-way multi-use roadway. The confusing intersection of the two legs at Fifth Street would become a simple \\"Village Plaza\\", with sidewalk extensions and a small amphitheater on the western sidewalk. Finally, Cooper Triangle would be renovated, and expanded to make a new \\"Cooper Walk\\" leading up to Cooper Union. New trees would be planted up and down the square on both sides.

It has a population of about 120,000. It is part of the metropolitan zone of Bucaramanga, which is the fifth largest urban area of Colombia by population. Geography Piedecuesta is situated in the Rio de Oro valley. One of its most notable landmarks is the Cantera's Hill, on top of which sits a large statue of the Virgin Mary (known locally as Cantera's virgin). Other landmarks include Guatiguara's valley, the Saints' Plateau, part of Chicamocha Canyon, and Ruitoque Plateau. Economy Piedecuesta is an important agricultural area; some products are Castilla blackberries (major national producer), tobacco (a traditional product since the Spanish Colonial Era), Tahitian lime (one of the largest national producers), and sugar cane (the town remains a major panela producer). The town is a major service center and owns the most develop-able land of a metropolitan city. Piedecuesta also contains multiple rivers within its boundaries, such as the Gold River, the Manco River, and the Hato River. Recent developments include: Ruitoque Plateau, which offers golf courses and high level condominiums; the Valley of Menzuly, which will soon include an international hospital; and The Saints' Plateau, a tourist destination. Industrial development in Piedecuesta has seen recent surges with the expansion of large companies into the area. These companies include ICP(Colombian Institute of Petroleum) and UIS Guatiguar√° (a high-level research center of the Industrial University of Santander). Tourism The Saints' Plateau landscape includes several waterfalls and views of Chicamocha Canyon. Holy Week: As most citizens of Piedecuesta are of the Catholic faith, this day is traditionally spent visiting religious monuments such as the virgin of the Cantera's Hill, the Mountain of Hermits, and the procession of Nazarene into the main streets. Liberty Park lies in the center of the town and is surrounded by several buildings, including the San Francisco Javier church (which was built with red stone from the Cantera's Hill) and the Perpetuo Socorro church (the first church of the town). The presence of two large churches in a town of this size is unusual in Colombia. The Municipal Palace is an ancient building of the local government.

The province of V√©lez is found in the area shaded red, established as an independent segment of the confederation (neither Zipa nor Zaque). The area was originally inhabited by four Muisca tribes, three of which named the: Semisos, Irobaes y Popobas, their heritage now only surviving in the names of three surrounding veredas. Annual parades celebrating local culture and music The area between Puente and neighbouring Santa Sof√≠a (or Guatoque) was inhabited by a major tribe called the Sorocot√° , governing a major commercial centre possibly home to the region's largest agricultural market. Puente's local radio station is today called La Voz de Sorocot√° (The Voice of Sorocot√°). The town still has a market every Monday which sees locally sourced produce brought to the town from the town's plethora of surrounding farms. The town's Santa Barbara church, the local parish. In 1730 supposedly built over the former residence of the cacique of the Sorocot√°s However as the former territory was recorded to have been based in Guatoque-Santa Sof√≠a the narrative is unconfirmed. The Hoyo de La Romera on the side of Santa Sof√≠a remains the only alleged historical vestige to the area's indigenous past, though the claim is yet to be supported by archeological evidence. Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada travelled south through the area in 1537 in the search for El Dorado. Having followed the course of the Magdalena River, his expedition then travelled down the Saravita, which formed the main trajectory of the subsequent conquests. It was in this area that some sources report that Quesada's men made the first ever encounter with a \\"truffle\\" crop later identified as the potato. Following the Spanish conquests a new town was baptised Puente Real de V√©lez, existing as a subsidiary to the town founded by Martin Galeano in 1539, before eventually acquiring its current name during the period which followed the comunero rebellions of 1781. These local uprisings set in motion the first wave of Spanish American victories against the Spanish Empire, however an eventual liberation only arrived after 1819. Every year on the 8th of May week, the town transforms with homage to the comuneros. On the day of the main celebration, townspeople dress in traditional late-18th century attire and have parades across the town. The town's Cantarrana Street was the setting for a now-regularly commemorated massacre at the close of the bipartisan Colombian Civil War of the mid-twentieth. On 29 September 1960, the decennial conflict antagonising liberals and conservatives culminated with a shooting involving local brigand Efrain Gonzalez killing 11 civilians and injuring 19. In nearby Flor√≠an lie the Windows of Tisquizoque waterfalls, associated with the former cacique of the same name. Furthermore, interest in El Pe√±on has also risen prominently because of speleological research and tourism. The town has a tropical climate with significant precipitations even during the driest month. The area's average monthly temperatures range the mid 20s .

Lowry (c.1824‚Äì1865) was an American Democratic politician, newspaper publisher and pioneer in St. Cloud, Minnesota before the American Civil War. He moved there from Kentucky, bringing some slaves with him as laborers. He was elected to the Territorial Council, as the first mayor of the city, and to the Minnesota State Senate in 1862. Repeatedly attacked in writing by the abolitionist newspaper publisher Jane Swisshelm, he found his political influence reduced. He started a rival paper The Union, which became the St. Cloud Times. He died young in 1865. Early life and education Born in Kentucky, Lowry became a trader and slaveowner. His father was David Lowry, a Cumberland Presbyterian minister of Scots descent. Migration In 1847 Lowry moved to Minnesota, settling in Brockway about 10 miles north of Saint Cloud, on the Mississippi River. He moved into St. Cloud in 1853. His success as a trader enabled him to build a large mansion there. His father, a Presbyterian minister who established a Cumberland mission; and sister Elizabeth and her husband also migrated to St. Cloud by 1854. Lowry took slaves with him as laborers, although the territory residents voted to have it be \\"free\\" or without slavery. Initially Lowry worked as a trader with Indians for furs, establishing a wide network. More Southerners entered the state after 1857, when the US Supreme Court ruled in the Dred Scott case that, as slaves were not citizens, they had no standing to file freedom suits. Its decision also that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional meant that Minnesota could not enforce its prohibition against slavery. Although the numbers of slaves were not high, several counties around and including St. Cloud had populations of slaves brought by Southerners before the American Civil War. When the war broke out, most of the Southerners left, taking their slaves with them. Political career Lowry became active in the Democratic Party in the territory, and established himself as the political boss of St. Cloud. He was elected to the Minnesota Territorial Council, serving from 1852 to 1854. He served as the first mayor of the newly incorporated city in 1856. The city hospital was built on land which he had owned. Active in the state party, Lowry was being groomed to run as Lieutenant Governor. He is well known in Minnesota folklore for his conflict with the abolitionist newspaper publisher Jane Grey Swisshelm, who repeatedly attacked him for his slaveholding as well as mistreatment of the Winnebago people, damaging his political influence. He started a rival paper, The Union, to offset her paper's opinions.

Originally designed by the Spanish aircraft company Iberavia, its first (of two) prototype flew on 16 July 1951. It was a low-wing monoplane of conventional configuration with fixed, tricycle undercarriage and a large, bubble canopy over the two side-by-side seats. Flight characteristics were found to be pleasing, but before plans could be made for mass production, Iberavia was acquired by AISA. The new management decided to continue with development, but made a few changes to the design, reducing the size of the canopy, and replacing the undercarriage with a taildragger arrangement. This configuration entered production in 1952 with an order from the Director General for Civil Aviation for 70 aircraft for use in Spain's aeroclubs. The Spanish Air Force then ordered 125 for use in training and liaison roles. The Air Force then requested 200 aircraft built with the seats in tandem, which were designated I-115 by the manufacturers powered by a 112 kW (150 hp) ENMA Tigre inverted air-cooled engine.

As of 2020, San Gil had a population of roughly 46,000 people within the total municipal area, making it the third largest urban area in the department, after Bucaramanga and Barrancabermeja. Founded in 1689, San Gil is over 300 years old. It was officially named the tourist capital of the region in 2004, thanks to its outdoor activity opportunities such as rafting, caving, kayaking and hiking. View of the main square of San Gil, Santander, 1999.  History  San Gil's history goes back to pre-Columbian times, when it was inhabited by native indigenous people called the Guanes. Spanish conquest during the colonial period nearly eradicated the local tribes. The town was officially founded on March 17, 1689 by Don Gil Cabrera D√°valos and Leonardo Correa de Betancourt. According to official sources, San Gil played an important role during the Colombian independence period. \\"Comuneros\\" rebels came from nearby regions, united, traveled to the capital, Bogota, and fought for the nation's independence, a process which occurred during the early 1820s.  Demographics  San Gil's population, as of 2005, was 42,000, (including the rural area). The majority (36,748) reside in the urban area. The population as of 2020 was estimated to be 46‚Äô152, an increase of roughly 1,500 people, but showing a tendency to decrease in rural areas, decreasing from 6,240 to a projected 5,601. Ninety- eight percent of houses have access to electricity, 90.3% to running water, and 84.1% to a sewage system.  Tourism  In 2004, San Gil was named the tourist capital of the region. The area offers several outdoor activity opportunities, such as rafting (grade 1-5), kayaking, hiking, and caving. Local companies offer rafting packages through various rivers depending on skill level. ‚ÄúParque el Gallineral‚Äù is a popular destination with its characteristic moss-covered trees resembling beards. It has a small entrance fee. The park has a number of paths running through its 10-acre area and by the city‚Äôs main river, ‚ÄúRio Fonce‚Äù. The park‚Äôs name comes from the 1867 characteristic ‚Äúgallinero‚Äù trees planted throughout the whole area. San Gil's main square is called \\"Parque la Libertad\\" (Liberty Park), which is the most common meeting place in the town and a hub for night life. The town's main cathedral, built in 1791 and remodeled in 1965, is located in this area. ‚ÄúParque Nacional del Chicamocha‚Äù (Chicamocha National Park or PANACHI) is another Eco-tourist park located roughly 1 hour away from San Gil, placed on a scenic spot in the Chicamocha Canyon. The park has a museum, hiking trails, rafting, paragliding and other outdoor activities. It also has a 6.3 km (3.91 mi) long cable car, one of the longest in the world in its category, offering a ride across the canyon and into the plateau called \\"Mesa de los Santos\\". Barichara, a small colonial town roughly 20 minutes away from San Gil, is another popular destination. Situated at the rim of the Chicamocha Canyon, it offers a scenic view across the canyon and the Suarez River. It is known as \\"one of the prettiest towns in the whole nation\\" due to its well preserved colonial architecture and stone streets.  Economy  Besides tourism, the region's economy relies heavily on agriculture. Products such as tobacco, sugar cane and coffee are commonly grown in farms nearby which are mainly commercialized in the town's main market plaza. One of the region's most historically important entrepreneurs was Jos√© Mar√≠a Rueda G√≥mez, known as \\"Conde de Cuchicute\\", who, in spite of his eccentricity, pushed the development of coffee production, and helped establish the first bank and a hydroelectric power plant for the region.  Transport  San Gil is very well connected to the rest of the country. By Air it is connected through \\"Los Pozos\\" a small regional airport for chartered flights and seasonal commercial flights By land Berlinas del Fonce, Copetran, Omega, Reina and Cootrasangil among other companies ensure connectivity with Bogota and Bucaramanga.

It was founded in 1681 by Jos√© de Archila and Jos√© D√≠az Sarmiento.The town was very influential in the history of Colombia. There began the revolt of the Comuneros of 1781 against the oppression of Spanish rule. Socorro was the capital of Santander between 1862 and 1886. History The origin of the population was much more prosaic and simple. Broadly it can be argued that formed beside the road leading from Velez to Giron, the exact site where today is located. Jose de Archila and Jos√© D√≠az Sarmiento, wealthy landowners chanchona Valley, donated the land to the Virgen de Nuestra Senora del Socorro, to set the village on 16 June 1683. Blas Garc√≠a Cabrera, influential and neighboring potentate representing many settlers, requested the erection of the parish to the metropolitan curia Santa Fe, with such good fortune, that the Archbishop Antonio Sanz Lozano Auto created it by November 27 Next, under the name of ‚ÄúNuestra Senora del Socorro‚Äù and 2 December, the president, governor and captain general of New Granada, Francisco del Castillo de la Concha civilly approved the new administrative section. At the request of Captain Francisco Arias of Toledo and numerous neighbors, after four decades of constant progress of population, chairman Archbishop Francisco de Cossio and Otero granted the title of city in 1771, which changed the name to \\"City of Our Lady Cossio Socorro and Otero, whose officials took office on Aug. 15. However, as such grace, not filled the legal requirements, ie they were granted by the King of Spain, Felipe V objected and overruled on December 30, 1712. Perhaps the origin of \\"Very Noble and Loyal Villa\\", to which King III of Spain with this honorable designation lifted on 25 October 1771, granting further coat of arms on 25 April 1773, which is Marine exaltation. For the Mother of God, under the title Our Lady of Mercy, has presided over all the events of the years of Vila today. In 1795 King Charles IV created the capital province of Socorro with the same name, in territory more than half of the current department of Santander, which remained in force until 13 May 1857, when Congress established the State of Santander, which later became king. Socorro sporadically served as capital and property since 14 September 1861 by the Constituent Assembly Act until 24 March 1886, when Dr. Antonio Roldan pro executive decree, the moved to Bucaramanga. Socorro in the Revolution broke the Communards on 16 March 1781. Arciniegas states: \\"In New Granada the independence war, began to germinate in Distress\\" and is absolutely right. For the excessive taxes, socorran people revolted against colonial authorities in the revolution of the commoners, the only social upheaval in the annals named captains, generals as his chiefs, that is, chose a plural executive, which means that democracy was born here, the right of citizens to elect and be elected. Here also originated the army, clad in sisal-soled sandals, trousers, blanket, linen shirt and hat of bamboo, because Don Juan Generalissimo Francisco Barbee official appointed upper and lower, sergeants, corporals and the full range of levels that existed and exist in the military. The villagers were betrayed, Galan, Molina and Juan Manuel Jos√© Ortiz Manosalvas and Alcantuz paid with his life the perennial desire to be free men. But the seed of freedom remained dormant. Again the Socorrans, headed by Dr. Jose Lorenzo Silver and Martinez gave the dish with the colonial regime on 10 July 1810. Historia Del Socorro Socorro is the birthplace of Colombian painter Oscar Rodr√≠guez Naranjo (1907‚Äì2006).  Geography =The location of Socorro Socorro has a total land area of 12,210 hectares.

Its boundaries are north to the town of Cabrera and Pinchote the south by the Socorro Confines and Palms on the east with Paramo on the west with Simacota and Palmar. Landscape Socorro's landscape ranges from strongly inclined (25% to 50%) to very steep (slopes greater than 75%). Having areas of gentle slope determines the usage of land to nature conservation, forestry or exploiting permanent crops such as coffee, sugar cane, citrus, banana, cassava, tomato, beans, millet, corn, watermelon, pumpkins, etc.. However, due to the needs of the population, these regions have been affected by logging and burning of native forests for the establishment of farming in unsuitable areas, or for operation in annual crops with the consequent danger of promoting to keep soil erosion, unprotected natural vegetation, so it's reforestation few programs do not consider the native vegetation to preserve the species by altering the native flora. The steep slopes prevent the use of heavy farm machinery, by tillage implements and utensils rudimentary and smaller tools. Climate and vegetation The vast majority of the area which sits the Socorro corresponds to the weather that occurs in pre-montane humid forest (1,200 to 2,000 m) and tropical dry forest (900 to 1,200 masl). One of the main factors determining the climate of the municipality is its elevation, being located in a mountainous slope. His lands are distributed in warm and temperate climatic zones, being most of the land in production between 1,000 and 1,800 m above sea level.

JEB is the result of a genetic mutation that inhibits protein production that is essential for skin adhesion. Therefore, tissues, such as skin and mouth epithelia, are affected. Blisters form over the entire body causing pain and discomfort,and open sores leave newborn foals highly susceptible to secondary infection. The condition can be categorized into two types of mutations: JEB1 and JEB2. JEB1 is found in Belgian Draft horses, as well as other related Draft breeds. In contrast, JEB2 is found in American Saddlebred horses. Breeds affected JEB has documented in Belgian drafts, American Cream Draft, Breton drafts, Comtois, and American Saddlebreds. Of these horses, 12% of Belgians and 4% of Saddlebreds are thought to carry the disorder.\\"Testing for Genetic Diseases.\\" Equus 353. pp 42‚Äì43. Humans JEB also affects the human population. Symptoms are closely related to those that are seen in horses. Blisters occur over a large portion of the body and are very susceptible to agitation. There are other symptoms associated, such as alopecia (hair loss), abnormalities of fingernails and toenails, and joint deformities. Children born with JEB may not live past the first year of age if the condition is severe enough. Other children that have a less severe case of JEB may live a normal lifespan. Genetics JEB is an autosomal recessive trait; both parents must carry the recessive gene in order to have an affected offspring. If N represents a normal individual and J represents an affected individual, the following crosses indicate the rate of occurrence among related horses. (N/J) x (N/J) = 50% N/J, 25% N/N, and 25% J/J (N/N) x (N/J) = 50% N/N and 50% N/J Foals which are homozygous recessive (J/J) do not make it to reproductive age, so cannot be a parent. Carriers (N/J) do not display symptoms and have normal skin. Mutations in the genes LAMB3, LAMC2, and COL17A1, are the cause of JEB. These genes are associated with the protein responsible for skin attachment to the underlying layers, laminin 332. When the genes undergo mutations, the protein is altered, making it dysfunctional. As a result, the skin is very fragile and may be damaged by even minor trauma. Another protein, called type XVII collagen, is affected by a mutation in COL17A1. Due to this mutation, the defective protein is not able to produce collagen, which provides strength and structure for the skin. For this reason, the skins resistance to trauma is weakened. Symptoms Foals appear normal immediately after birth. JEB affects tissues including mucous membranes, so one of the first signs is blistering of the gingiva and tongue after the first attempt at nursing. Within the next few days, the foal develops lesions all over the body, especially over pressure points. The proteins affected by the gene mutations are also present in the hooves, causing hooves to slough. Other symptoms that occur in JEB: * Corneal lesions * Dental dysplasia * Depression * Oral ulcers * Suppressed appetite * Incisors present at birth Diagnosis and testing Biopsies of the skin may be performed to identify the cleavage that takes place at the dermal-epidermal junction. Another test that can aid in a diagnosis of JEB is the positive Nikolsky‚Äôs sign. By applying pressure to the skin, transverse movements can indicate slipping between the dermal and epidermal layers. An easier and more definitive test is through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This method allows mane and tail samples to be genetically tested for the mutated genes that cause the condition. Hair samples must be pulled, not cut, with roots attached. The test can detect both JEB1 and JEB2. Testing costs around $35.00 US per sample. Prognosis One of the biggest risks factors faced by the affected foals is susceptibility to secondary infection. Within three to eight days after birth, the foal may die from infection or is euthanized for welfare reasons. Treatment and prevention Currently, there are no treatments available for JEB. However, the disorder can be prevented through good breeding management. Horses that are carriers of JEB should not be incorporated into breeding programs. Although, if breeders are insistent on breeding a carrier, precautions need to be taken to ensure that the other mate is not a carrier as well. Genetic testing for the disorder is highly recommended among breeding programs for the Draft horse and Saddlebred breeds to determine their carrier status.

It knows no boundaries, is not gender-specific, embraces all faiths and cultures. It is just about the values of our common humanity. Its growing international presence required the formation of an international coordinating organization (ALIVE) in 2004. ALIVE is established as a not-for-profit foundation in Geneva, Switzerland. As of November 2018, Living Values Education through ALIVE has some 30 Associate representative country organisations and 15 country Focal Points, individuals representing the educational approach. Over 40 countries in all regions of the world are involved in extending Values awareness to all age groups with emphasis of school education, special \\"At Risk\\" interest areas; drug rehabilitation, prison inmates, refugees, street children, earthquake, war and natural disaster victims. The facilitators and trainers for Living Values reach into every facet of society where Values are felt to be recognised and understood as the common bond of all people. In addition to practical activities in group workshops, classroom activity and study groups in Values educational delivery, Living Values is also extended into countries around the globe with Online Correspondence Courses to anyone seeking to explore Values in their personal lives, community, school classroom, business etc., through the organisation's website - http://livingvalues.net Activities LVE provides professional development courses with educational resource materials to help educators and others support all people to explore and develop universal values, according to their cultural background. The focus is on twelve primary values being: Peace, Love, Respect, Tolerance, Responsibility, Humility, Honesty, Cooperation, Happiness, Simplicity, Freedom, Unity. All of which can be expressed in life through attitude, behavior and relationships. Other values are also involved. The Programmes support children, youth, educators, parents, business and communities in understanding, developing and sharing values in daily life. Living Values Education (LVE) is a way of conceptualizing values awareness that promotes the development of values-based learning communities and places the search for meaning and purpose at the heart of our lives. LVE emphasizes the worth and integrity of each person involved in the provision of education, in the home, school and community. In fostering quality values-based education, LVE supports the overall development of the individual and a culture of positive values in each society and throughout the world, believing that values awareness is a fundamental purposeful activity designed to help humanity flourish. [13] The implementation of Living Values Education is facilitated by the Association for Living Values Education International (ALIVE), a non-profit-making association of organizations around the world concerned with values education. Drawing on a strong volunteer base, the advancement and implementation of Living Values Education has been historically supported by UNESCO and a host of other organizations, agencies, governmental bodies, foundations, community groups and individuals. It is part of the global movement of the United Nations International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. ALIVE groups together national bodies promoting Living Values Education and is an independent organization that does not have any particular or exclusive religious, political or national affiliation or interest. [13] In 2001, LVE's series of five books won 'The Teachers' Choice Award' by Learning Magazine,[5] a national publication in the USA for teachers and educators. This series of three age group (3‚Äì7, (8‚Äì14), (Young Adults) activity books have all been re-edited in 2019 and are publicly available through Amazon. Separate special programmes exist for children at risk including refugees and Children Affected by War (LVARCAW), street children, [6] youth in need of drug rehabilitation and young offenders. The Ministry of Labor in Vietnam noted in March 2008 that LVE‚Äô drug rehabilitation program was the most successful drug rehab program in government rehabilitation clinics in the country. [13] New initiatives introduced in 2019 widen the reach of LVE through distance facilitator training programs, increased regional gatherings of ALIVE membership, a much detailed website offering extended resource of downloadable materials covering a wide-ranging application of values aspects.

Jessica Bawens-Sugimoto feels that in general, \\"slash and yaoi fans are dismissive of mainstream hetero-sexual romance\\", such as \\"the notorious pulp Harlequin romances\\". Deborah Shamoon said that \\"the borders between yaoi, sh≈çjo manga and ladies' comics are quite permeable\\", suggesting that fans of BL probably enjoyed both homosexual and heterosexual tales.Shamoon, Deborah (July 2004) ‚ÄúOffice Sluts and Rebel Flowers: The Pleasures of Japanese Pornographic Comics for Women‚Äù in Linda Williams ed.

Duke University Press p. 86 Kazuma Kodaka, in an interview with Giant Robot suggested that the Japanese yaoi fandom includes married women who had been her fans since they were in college. Dru Pagliassotti's survey indicates that loyalty to an author is a common factor in readers' purchase decisions. Y≈çka Nitta has noted a split in what her readers want - her younger readers prefer seeing explicit material, and her older readers prefer seeing romance.Totilo, Stephen. (10 March 2006) Japanese Comics With Gay Themes Attracting Young Female Readers MTV.com There is a perception that the English-speaking yaoi fandom is demanding increasingly explicit content,Chavez, Ed (30 October 2007) Yaoi-Con and BL, No Longer ‚ÄúNiche‚Äù Publishers Weekly but that this poses problems for retailers.ICv2 (2006) A Yaoi Explosion - Dozens of Titles Announced at Yaoi-Con In 2004, ICv2 noted that fans seemed to prefer buying yaoi online. Andrea Wood suggests that due to restrictions placed on the sale of yaoi, many Western teenage fans seek more explicit titles via scanlations. Dru Pagliassotti notes that the majority of respondents to her survey say that they first encountered BL online, which she links to half of her respondents reporting that they get most of their BL from scanlations. In 2003, there were at least five BL scanlation groups. Japanese fan practices in the mid to late 2000s included the concept of the feeling of moe, which was typically used by male otaku about young female characters prior to this. Robin Brenner and Snow Wildsmith noted in their survey of American fans that gay and bisexual male fans of yaoi preferred more realistic tales than female fans did. Shihomi Sakakibara (1998) argued that yaoi fans, including himself, were homosexually oriented female-to-male transsexuals.Sakakibara, Shihomi (1998) Yaoi genron: yaoi kara mieta mono (An Elusive Theory of Yaoi: The view from Yaoi). Tokyo: Natsume Shobo, . Akiko Mizoguchi believes there is a \\"shikou\\" (translated as taste or orientation), both towards BL/yaoi as a whole, and towards particular patterns within the genre, such as a \\"feisty bottom (yancha uke)\\" character type. Her study shows that fans believe that in order to be \\"serious\\" fans, they should know their own preferences, and \\"consider themselves a sort of sexual minority\\". She argues that the exchange of sexual fantasies between the predominantly female yaoi fandom can be interpreted that although the participants may be heterosexual in real life, they can also and compatibly be considered \\"virtual lesbians\\". Patrick Galbraith suggests that androgynous beautiful boys contribute to the appeal of yaoi amongst women who are heterosexual, lesbian or transgender. The small Taiwanese BL fandom has been noted to be against real-person BL fanfiction, banning it from their messageboard.  Fujoshi and fudanshi  is a reclaimed Japanese term for female fans of manga, anime and novels that feature romantic relationships between men. The label encompasses fans of the yaoi genre itself, as well as the related manga, anime and video game properties that have appeared as the market for such works has developed. The term \\"fujoshi\\" is a homophonous pun on , a term for respectable women, created by replacing the character meaning married woman, with the character meaning fermented or rotten, indicating that a woman who enjoys fictional gay content is ruined for marriage. The name was coined by 2channel in the early 2000s as a derogatory insult, but was later reclaimed as a self-descriptive term. \\"Fujoshi\\" carried a connotation of being a \\"fallen woman\\".Kotani Mari, foreword to Sait≈ç Tamaki (2007) \\"Otaku Sexuality\\" in Christopher Bolton, Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr., and Takayuki Tatsumi ed., page 224 Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams University of Minnesota Press An issue of Yureka which examined fujoshi in detail in 2007 contributed to the spread of the term. Older fujoshi use various terms to refer to themselves, including as , a pun on a homophonous word meaning \\"fine lady\\", and , which sounds similar to a phrase meaning \\"Madame Butterfly\\", possibly taken from a character nicknamed in the 1972 manga series Ace o Nerae! by Sumika Yamamoto. According to a 2005 issue of Eureka, in recent times fujoshi can refer to female otaku in general, although it cautions that not all yaoi fans are otaku, as there are some more casual readers. As fujoshi is the best-known term, it is often used by the Japanese media and by people outside of the otaku subculture to refer to female otaku as a group, regardless of whether they are fans of yaoi or not. This usage may be considered offensive by female otaku who are not yaoi fans. Men who, like fujoshi, enjoy imagining relationships between characters (especially male ones) in fictional works when that relationship is not part of the author's intent may be called or , both of which are puns of similar construction to fujoshi. Bara manga author Gengoroh Tagame has said that men may choose a fudanshi label because it is more socially acceptable than coming out as gay. As characters Fujoshi and fudanshi are used as characters in otaku-themed anime and manga, particularly those aimed at men. Popular titles include Tonari no 801-chan, My Girlfriend's a Geek, Kiss Him, Not Me and The High School Life of a Fudanshi. A TV series featuring a policewoman who is a fujoshi, Fujoshi Deka, has been broadcast. Yaoi and slash Besides commercially published original material, Japanese yaoi also encompasses fan- made d≈çjinshi, fanart, computer games, etc.; a large percentage of the d≈çjinshi offered at Comiket are yaoi stories based on popular anime and manga series. This may be seen as a parallel development to slash fiction in the West. Although sh≈çjo manga stories featuring romances between boys or young men were commercially published in Japan from the mid-1970s, and soon became a genre in their own right, the spread of yaoi though the Western fan community is generally linked to the pre-existing Western slash fiction community. In the mid-1980s, fan translations of the sh≈çjo manga series From Eroica with Love began to circulate through the slash community via amateur press associations,Thorn, Matthew. (2004) ‚ÄúGirls And Women Getting Out Of Hand: The Pleasure And Politics Of Japan's Amateur Comics Community.‚Äù pp. 169-186, In Fanning the Flames: Fans and Consumer Culture in Contemporary Japan, William W.

Although the English- speaking online yaoi fandom is observed to increasingly overlap with online slash fandom,Youssef, Sandra Girls who like Boys who like Boys - Ethnography of Online Slash/Yaoi Fans Honours Thesis for Bachelor of Arts, Mount Holyoke College, 2004. slash fiction has portrayed adult males, whereas yaoi follows the aesthetic of the beautiful boy, often highlighting their youth. Mark McLelland describes this aesthetic as being seen as problematic in recent Western society. Yaoi fans tend to be younger than slash fans, and so are less shocked about depictions of underage sexuality. Jessica Bauwens-Sugimoto detects a tendency in both yaoi and slash fandoms to disparage the others' heteronormativity, potential for subversiveness or even the potential for enjoyment.

Biographic data  Herr√°n was born and died in Bogot√°. He was also the son-in-law of Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera.  Early life  Herr√°n initiated his education in the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolom√© in Bogot√°, but he dropped out of school at the age of 14 to join the revolutionary army in 1814.  Military career  He enlisted in the revolutionary army of General Sim√≥n Bol√≠var as a teenager. He fought in several battles, and in the battle of Cuchilla del Tambo he was captured by the Spanish forces. He was court-martialed and sentenced to death by the military court. His death sentence was commuted in exchange for serving in the Spanish Army, which he did for five years. Later, he escaped and rejoined the revolutionary army of General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre with the rank of captain. He joined the armies of the southern campaigns in Nueva Granada and Per√∫. He fought in the battles of ‚ÄúBombon√°‚Äù (April 7, 1822), ‚ÄúBattle of Jun√≠n‚Äù (August 6, 1824), and ‚ÄúAyacucho‚Äù (December 9, 1824), the last of the greatest battles of the independence war against Spain. Because of his valor and heroic actions in combat, General Bol√≠var promoted him to the rank of General in 1828. Later, he was commissioned as Military Chief of the province of Panam√°. His best military performance was during the war of 1839, defending the government of Jos√© Ignacio de M√°rquez against the revolt of General Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando, due to the administration‚Äôs closure of the Catholic convents in the city of Pasto.

Political career  As stated above, Herr√°n was proclaimed as a presidential candidate by President M√°rquez. He faced two opponents, Eusebio Borrero and Vicente Azuero. However none of the three obtained a majority of the popular vote, and thus the election of a President was left to Congress . In 1841, Congress elected General Alc√°ntara as President and General Domingo Caycedo as Vice-President.  The Presidency  Herr√°n was elected President by Congress in 1841, for a four years period, but he was not able to be inaugurated as he was still commanding the government troops in the war against the southern revolt. He was supposed to be inaugurated on April 1, 1841, as provided by the Constitution, but in his place the Vice-President Domingo Caycedo was inaugurated.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos; trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 42; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 Due to the fact that the civil war that started in 1839 had escalated and spread to the Northern provinces, Herr√°n commissioned General Caycedo to lead the government troops in the northern campaign. Thus, Juan de Dios Aranzazu, President of the ‚ÄúConsejo de Estado‚Äù assumed the presidency from July 5, until October 19, 1841, when Caycedo returned to the presidency. Herr√°n returned triumphant to Bogot√° on May 19, 1842, and is sworn in as President.

Born in Metropolis, Illinois, he threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and . Early career A nephew of former major league first baseman Ben Taylor, Hawk Taylor was a schoolboy sensation at Metropolis Community High School, where he batted .650 in 1957, his senior season. The Braves signed him to a $119,000 bonus contract, the highest in MLB history at the time.Schmitt, Steve, Hawk Taylor. Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project The bonus rules then in force in baseball mandated that Taylor spend his first two pro seasons on the Braves' big-league roster, and he made his major league debut in June at the age of 18, appearing in seven games‚Äîalmost exclusively as a pinch runner or pinch hitter: he was given only one at bat by the future pennant- and World Series-winning Braves, and caught only one inning on defense. By his second season, , the bonus rule had been amended and the Braves were permitted to option Taylor to the Class B Three-I League to gain valuable playing time. Recalled by Milwaukee after September 1 when rosters expanded, he appeared in four games, starting two as a left fielder, and notched his first MLB hit. He then spent all of 1959 and 1960 sharpening his skills in the upper levels of the Braves' farm system, and was selected to the 1960 All-Star team as a catcher by the Triple-A American Association. Service with four MLB clubs Taylor then was a member of the Braves' official major league roster for the full seasons of ‚Äì63. However, because of injury and service in the United States Army, he appeared in only 56 total games over those three campaigns. Eclipsed by hard-hitting Joe Torre as the Braves' catcher of the future, Taylor moved to the outfield, where he started 22 games and played all three outfield positions. He hit his first MLB home run on the final day of the 1961 season, a ninth-inning, pinch-hit blow off Mike McCormick that enabled Milwaukee to even the score at 2‚Äì2 against the San Francisco Giants at County Stadium, and paved the way to an eventual 3‚Äì2 Brave triumph in extra innings.Retrosheet box score (1 October 1961): \\"Milwaukee Braves 3, San Francisco Giants 2 (2)\\" Hampered by a broken collarbone in 1963, Taylor managed only two hits in 29 at bats all season, and on December 2 his contract was sold to the National League's tail-ending team, the New York Mets. The Mets proceeded to give Taylor his most extended MLB opportunity. In , he got into 92 games, including 45 as a catcher and 16 in the outfield, and set personal bests in hits (54) and runs batted in (23). His offense declined in both and , although on August 17 of the latter season, he hit the first pinch- hit grand slam home run in Mets' history. After getting into only 13 games for the Mets and spending part of that year in the minor leagues, Taylor was acquired by the California Angels in July; the Angels' general manager, Fred Haney, had been Taylor's first-ever big-league manager. He batted .308 in limited duty (23 games and 52 at bats) for the Angels, spent 1968 in the minor leagues, and then was selected in the December 1968 Rule 5 draft by a brand- new expansion team, the Kansas City Royals. He was a member of the inaugural Royals' team in and performed creditably as a utilityman, with 24 hits and three home runs in 64 games, then added one more MLB season to his belt in a similar role for the Royals. Prior to the 1971 season, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox organization, and was playing with their Louisville Colonels affiliate when a back injury ended his career at the age of 32. Over his 11 major league seasons, Taylor played in 394 games and had 724 at bats, 56 runs scored, 158 hits, 25 doubles, 16 home runs, 82 RBI and 36 walks, as well as a .218 batting average, .258 on-base percentage, .319 slugging percentage, 231 total bases, two sacrifice flies and four intentional walks. In the field, he appeared as a catcher in 131 games, as an outfielder in 63, and a first baseman in 15. After his playing days ended, Taylor enjoyed coaching stints at Murray State University, Lambuth University and Paducah Community College. He was married to Marie Holifield Taylor for 49 years.

During the height of its existence, Blakeley was a thriving town which flourished as a competitor to its western neighbor, Mobile. Blakeley was the county seat for Baldwin County from 1820 until 1868, when the county government was moved south to Daphne. It was the location of a major fort during the Civil War. One of the last battles of the Civil War was fought here in April 1865, as Union soldiers overran Confederates. The town is now in an Alabama historic state park known as Historic Blakeley State Park, north of Spanish Fort. Before the town was established and populated by European settlers, Native Americans had lived in the area. A burial mound was found near the site of the town and was excavated. Four skulls, various bones and copper ornaments were found. In 1813, Blakeley was founded by Josiah Blakeley, \\"an entrepreneur and adventurer from Connecticut\\" who moved to Mobile in 1806. He purchased of land in the northeastern portion of Mobile Bay. In 1813 he hired a surveyor to lay out the town of Blakeley and sold the first 10 lots. On January 6, 1814, the Mississippi Territorial Legislature authorized Josiah Blakeley to lay out a town to be known as Blakeley.A Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama: Containing the Statutes and Resolutions in Force at the end of the General Assembly in January, 1823.

They left for New York City in 1820 to found Brown & Bell, a shipyard famous for its clipper ships and steamships. Blakeley had a \\"deep natural port, which was reachable by ships that could not cross the Dog River bar, a sandbar that sometimes impeded shipping access to Mobile.\\" For some years, Blakeley competed with Mobile to be the top port in what was then the Alabama Territory. A post office operated under the name \\"Blakeley\\" from 1826 to 1866. In 1974, the ghost town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Biography Thomas Edward Scrutton was born in London, the son of Thomas Urquhart Scrutton, a wealthy shipowner and head of the well-known shipping firm of Scrutton and Co. He was educated at the Mill Hill School. From there, he was a student at Trinity College, Cambridge, and at University College London. At Cambridge he won the Whewell Scholarship and the Yorke Prize four times, the first person to do so. He was also President of the Cambridge Union. Despite his achievements, he did not obtain a fellowship at Trinity; his former pupil Sir Frank MacKnnon speculated that Scrutton did not attempt to gain fellowship, due to a feeling among some fellows that he lacked \\"originality\\". He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1882, and developed a busy practice in commercial cases. He became a King's Counsel in 1901 and a bencher of the Middle Temple in 1908. He was also professor of constitutional law and legal history at University College, London. In the 1886 election, he stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate for Limehouse. He wrote The Contract of Affreightment as Expressed in Charter-parties and Bills of Lading (1886), in which he was able to draw on his knowledge of the family business as well as his legal training. Over a century later, this is still the standard text on the topic, while several of his other legal works, especially that on copyright, remain useful. Scrutton owned and was involved with the management of St. Paul's Industrial School, subject of a scandal in 1882 brough to notice by Elizabeth Surr and others. It was asserted that food intended for the boys was diverted to the staff, the boys were not eating or being clothed properly and there was a history of excessive punishment including the use of manacles and handcuffs. The home secretary ordered an inquiry, and for the school to be closed. In June 1882, Scrutton, who was a member of the school board and chairman of its industrial schools sub-committee, brought a successful action for libel against fellow school board member Helen Tayor, who was requird to pay Scrutton ¬£1,000, but who was also exonerated by the judge from any personal malice. The St. Paul's Industrial School inquiry brought about a thorough reform of the London industrial schools. Scrutton had to resign as chair and later as a member of the school board. Judicial career Copyright, Vanity Fair, 1911 He was a judge of the King's Bench Division (1910‚Äì16) and of the Court of Appeal (1916‚Äì34).Online Encyclopedia: Sir Thomas Edward Scrutton He frequently sat in the Court of Appeal with BankesSee The Rowers of Vanity Fair/Bankes JE and Atkin LJJ, a combination which has often been cited as one of the strongest benches ever to sit in commercial cases.E.g. in Borealis Ab v. Stargas Limited and Others and Bergesen D.Y. A/S [2001] UKHL 17; [2001] 2 All ER 193, per Lord Hobhouse at para 20; Imageview Management Ltd v. Kelvin Jack [2009] EWCA Civ 63 per Jacob LJ at para 20 and per Mummery LJ at para 64. On the criminal side he presided over the celebrated 1915 \\"Brides-in-the-Bath\\" trial of George Joseph Smith, and made a crucial ruling on \\"similar fact evidence\\" : Smith was charged with murdering only one of his recent brides by drowning her in the bath, but Scrutton ruled that the fact that two of his other brides had died in almost identical circumstances was admissible as evidence of a method or pattern of murder. Despite his great ability, Scrutton had a reputation as a difficult judge to appear before: \\"he did not suffer fools gladly, and often refused to suffer them at all\\" was one verdict. His stern appearance and sweeping beard (he is said never to have shaved) intimidated most of those who appeared before him. His intolerance extended even to other judges, particularly the flamboyant and controversial Sir Henry McCardie whom he openly despised, and whom he attacked with increasing bitterness until their mutual antipathy resulted in a public quarrel. McCardie committed suicide soon afterwards, but the cause is generally thought to have been depression, unconnected to the quarrel. His reputation for being difficult may explain his failure to achieve further promotion to the House of Lords, since he was unquestionably well qualified on merit to be a Law Lord. In his later years he is said to have mellowed considerably: Henry Cecil, the judge and humourist, recalled in his memoir Just Within the Law that Scrutton, in the only case Cecil argued in front of him, had been perfectly polite, although he could not resist one dry comment that a barrister who feels that he must repeat every point four times cannot have much opinion of the Court's intelligence. James Atkin, Baron Atkin, his former pupil, always spoke of Scrutton with affection and respect Personal life and family In private life he had a passion for golf. He was noted for religious scepticism: at his death he left instructions that there should be \\"no empty Christian rituals\\" at his burial, although his wishes were either ignored or overlooked. His son Tom, in contrast to his father's scepticism, became a clergyman. He married Mary Burton in 1884 and had three sons and one daughter. The youngest son died in the First World War.Sir Frank MacKinnon, D.N.B 1931 - 1940 Mary Midgley, the philosopher, was his granddaughter, and gave a valuable sketch of him in her 2005 autobiography An Owl of MInerva.

Nominal compounds occur with various structures, but morphologically speaking they are essentially the same: each noun (or adjective) is in its (weak) stem form, with only the final element receiving case inflection. Avyayƒ´bhƒÅva The first member of this type of nominal compound is an indeclinable, to which another word is added so that the new compound also becomes indeclinable (i.e., ). Examples: + (\\"per power\\"; as much as possible), + (near ), etc. In avyayƒ´bhƒÅva compounds, the first member has primacy (), i.e., the whole compound behaves like an indeclinable due to the nature of the first part which is indeclinable. Tatpuru·π£a (determinative) Unlike the avyayƒ´bhƒÅva compounds, in Tatpuru·π£a compounds the second member has primacy (). There are many types of tatpuru·π£a (one for each of the nominal cases, and a few others besides). In a tatpuru·π£a, the first component is in a case relationship with another. For example, \\"doghouse\\" is a dative compound, a house for a dog. It would be called a refers to the fourth case, that is, the dative). Incidentally, the word \\"tatpuru·π£a\\" is itself a tatpuru·π£a (meaning a \\"that-man\\", in the sense of \\"that person's man\\", meaning someone's agent), while \\"caturthƒ´tatpuru·π£a\\" is a karmadhƒÅraya, being both dative and a tatpuru·π£a. An easy way to understand it is to look at English examples of tatpuru·π£as: \\"battlefield\\", where there is a genitive relationship between \\"field\\" and \\"battle\\", \\"a field of battle\\"; other examples include instrumental relationships (\\"thunderstruck\\") and locative relationships (\\"town-dwelling\\"). All these normal Tatpuru·π£a compounds are called , because the case ending should depend upon the second member because semantically the second member has primacy, but actually the case ending depends upon the first member. Literally, means opposite or different case ending. But when the case ending of both members of a tatpuru·π£a compound are similar, then it is called a karmadhƒÅraya tatpuru·π£a compound, or simply a karmadhƒÅraya compound. Dvigu is a subtype of in which the modifying member is a number. (lit., \\"[a] two-cow [person]\\"; i.e., one who has two cows) itself is a compound : +. KarmadhƒÅraya (descriptive) It is a variety of tatpuru·π£a as shown above, but treated separately. The relation of the first member to the last is appositional, attributive or adverbial, e. g. (owl+demon) is a demon in the shape of an owl. =Madhyama-pada-lopƒ´- samƒÅsa= It is that variety of KarmadhƒÅraya tatpuru·π£a compound in which the middle part is implied but not present for brevity. E.g., , lit. \\"god- Brahmin\\", concatenated from \\"god-worshipping Brahmin\\". Na√±-samƒÅsa Example: + = , in which 'na' when placed in an initial position becomes 'a-' (or an- before a word starting with a vowel). While useful in classification, this is said to be etymologically \\"incorrect\\". Historically 'a-' negation is originated from na in its weak grade, Indo-European ne is normal grade form (Sanskrit na) and its weak grade is sonant ≈Ü, which in Sanskrit becomes a or an depending on the following sound. Upapada-samƒÅsa A variety of tatpuru·π£a compound in which nouns make unions with verbs. These compounds can be recognized by the fact that the second part contains a (possibly transformed) verbal root (dhƒÅtu): kumbham + k·πõ = kumbhakƒÅra [potter, lit. pot- maker]; ≈õƒÅstram + j√±ƒÅ = ≈õƒÅstraj√±a [learned person, one who knows scriptures]; jalam + dƒÅ = jalada [one that gives water; cloud]. Dvandva (co-ordinative) These consist of two or more noun stems, connected in sense with 'and' (copulative or coordinative). There are mainly two kinds of ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ (dvandva pair) constructions in Sanskrit: Itaretara dvandva The result of (itaretara dvandva \\"enumerative dvandva\\") is an enumerative word, the meaning of which refers to all its constituent members. The resultant compound word is in the dual or plural number and takes the gender of the final member in the compound construction. For example: * rƒÅmalak·π£ma·πáau (Rama and Lakshmana), equivalent to rƒÅma≈õ ca lak·π£ma·πáa≈õ ca. It describes the sons of King Da≈õaratha, around whom, along with RƒÅma's wife Sƒ´tƒÅ, the epic RƒÅmaya·πáa revolves. * rƒÅmalak·π£ma·πáabharata≈õatrugh·πáƒÅ·∏• (Rama and Lakshmana and Bharata and Shatrughna), equivalent to rƒÅma≈õ ca lak·π£ma·πáa≈õ ca bharata≈õ ca ≈õatrugh·πáa≈õ ca. It describes all the sons of King Da≈õaratha. * dhƒÅtulakƒÅrapuru·π£avacanƒÅni (verb stem, case, person and number), equivalent to ‡§ß‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§≤‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§µ‡§ö‡§®‡§Ç ‡§ö dhƒÅtu≈õ ca lakƒÅra≈õ ca puru·π£a≈õ ca vacana·πÉ ca. It describes the method of describing verb inflections and conjugations. SamƒÅhƒÅra dvandva Words may be organised in a compound to form a metonym, and sometimes the words may comprise all the constituent parts of the whole. The resultant compound word exhibits (samƒÅhƒÅra dvandva collective dvandva), and is always neuter and in the singular number. * pƒÅ·πáipƒÅdam (limbs/appendages), equivalent to ‡§™‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä ‡§ö ‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡•å ‡§ö pƒÅ·πáƒ´ ca pƒÅdau ca (two) hands (and) two feet According to some grammarians, there is a third kind of dvandva, called ekashesha dvandva (one-(stem)-remains dvandva), where only one stem remains in the compound of multiple words: this exhibits \\"true\\" metonymy. * pitarau (parents), equivalent to mƒÅtƒÅ ca pitƒÅ ca (mother and father). Here, the only stem used is pit·πõ (father) which in dual case (as there are two entities: mother and father) declines to give pitarau (fathers), or in this case pitarau (parents). Itaretara dvandva can also be performed to give mƒÅtƒÅpitarau (mother and father), and this can mean precisely the same as pitarau. Bahuvrƒ´hi (possessive) Bahuvrƒ´hi, or \\"much-rice\\", denotes a rich person‚Äîone who has much rice. Bahuvrƒ´hi compounds refer (by example) to a compound noun with no head‚Äîa compound noun that refers to a thing which is itself not part of the compound. For example, \\"low-life\\" and \\"block-head\\" are bahuvrƒ´hi compounds, since a low-life is not a kind of life, and a block-head is not a kind of head. (And a much-rice is not a kind of rice.) Compare with more common, headed, compound nouns like \\"fly-ball\\" (a kind of ball) or \\"alley cat\\" (a kind of cat). Bahurvrƒ´his can often be translated by \\"possessing...\\" or \\"-ed\\"; for example, \\"possessing much rice\\", or \\"much-riced\\". In simple terms, it is a compound which is an adjective for a third word which is not a part of the compound. Aluk-samƒÅsa  In an aluk-samƒÅsa, case endings do not vanish, e.g., ƒÅtmane + padam = ƒÅtmanepadam. ƒÄmre·∏çita (iterative) A compound consisting of the same word repeated, but with the first occurrence being accented. Amreditas are used to express repetitiveness; for example, from d√≠v (day) we obtain div√©-dive (day after day, daily) and from dev√° (god) we obtain ' or dev√≥-devas (god after god).

It is his second, following his bestselling 2003 debut, The Kite Runner. Mariam is an illegitimate child, and suffers from both the stigma surrounding her birth along with the abuse she faces throughout her marriage. Laila, born a generation later, is comparatively privileged during her youth until their lives intersect and she is also forced to accept a marriage proposal from Rasheed, Mariam's husband. Hosseini has remarked that he regards the novel as a \\"mother-daughter story\\" in contrast to The Kite Runner, which he considers a \\"father-son story\\". It continues some of the themes used in his previous work, such as the familial aspects, but focuses primarily on female characters and their roles in Afghan society. Earning widespread critical acclaim upon publication, A Thousand Splendid Suns was released on May 22, 2007, and received favorable prepublication reviews from Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, and Booklist, becoming a number one New York Times bestseller for fifteen weeks following its release. During its first week on the market, it sold over one million copies. Columbia Pictures purchased film rights in 2007 and confirmed intentions to create a movie adaption of the book. The first theatrical adaptation of the book premiered on February 1, 2017, at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, California. Creation=Title The title of the book comes from a line in the Josephine Davis translation of the poem \\"Kabul\\",\\"Kabul\\", oldpoetry.com by the 17th-century Iranian poet Saib Tabrizi: :\\"Every street of Kabul is enthralling to the eye :Through the bazaars, caravans of Egypt pass :One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs :And the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls\\" In an interview, Khaled Hosseini explains, \\"I was searching for English translations of poems about Kabul, for use in a scene where a character bemoans leaving his beloved city, when I found this particular verse. I realized that I had found not only the right line for the scene, but also an evocative title in the phrase 'a thousand splendid suns,' which appears in the next-to-last stanza.\\" Inspiration When asked what led him to write a novel centered on two Afghan women, Hosseini responded: > \\"I had been entertaining the idea of writing a story of Afghan women for > some time after I'd finished writing The Kite Runner. That first novel was a > male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's > wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I > hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was > fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I > recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, > five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in > pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and > wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many of those > women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began > writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those > resilient women over and over. Though no one woman that I met in Kabul > inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible > stories of survival were always with me, and a good part of my inspiration > for this novel came from their collective spirit.\\" Writing Hosseini disclosed that in some ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly because when he penned The Kite Runner, \\"no one was waiting for it.\\" He also found his second novel to be more \\"ambitious\\" than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, \\"As I began to write, as the story picked up the pace and I found myself immersed in the world of Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and enabled me to tune out the background noise and get on with the business of inhabiting the world I was creating.\\" The characters \\"took on a life of their own\\" at this point and \\"became very real for [him]\\". Similar to The Kite Runner, the manuscript had to be extensively revised; Hosseini divulged that he ultimately wrote the book five times before it was complete. The novel's anticipated release was first announced in October 2006, when it was described as a story about \\"family, friendship, faith and the salvation to be found in love\\". Plot On the outskirts of Herat, a girl named Mariam lives with her embittered and estranged mother, Nana. Mariam's father, Jalil, is a businessman who owns a cinema and lives in Herat with his three wives and nine children, but his affair with Mariam's mother led to him sweeping her under the rug by building her a small hut outside of the city, relegating her to it. Nana resents Jalil for his mistreatment of her and deceptive attitude towards Mariam. Jalil travels to visit Mariam, his illegitimate daughter, every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. Jalil promises to do so. When he does not come, she travels to his house in Herat and sleeps on the street outside after Jalil's doorman refuses to let her in, claiming that Jalil is busy. Later, she storms into the house and sees her father, but Jalil's chauffeur drives her back home. Upon returning home, Mariam finds that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. She is taken to live in Jalil's house, but his wives push him to quickly arrange for Mariam to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty years her senior. Mariam resists, but is soon pressured into the marriage, moving away with Rasheed. In Kabul, Rasheed is initially kind and waits for her to adjust. However, as Mariam becomes pregnant and miscarries multiple times, their relationship sours, and he becomes increasingly moody and abusive over her inability to bear him a son. Meanwhile, a younger girl named Laila grows up in a neighboring house in Kabul. She is close to her father, a kind-hearted teacher, but worries over her mother, who is depressed and unresponsive following her two sons' death in the army. Laila is also close friends with Tariq, a neighbor boy, but their friendship is increasingly frowned upon by others as they grow older; in spite of this, they develop a secret romance. When Afghanistan enters the war and Kabul is bombarded by rocket attacks, Tariq's family decides to leave the city, and the emotional farewell between him and Laila culminates in them making love. Laila's family eventually also decides to leave the city, but a rocket destroys their house as they are preparing to leave, killing her parents and severely injuring Laila. She is subsequently taken in by Rasheed and Mariam. As Laila recovers from her injuries, Rasheed expresses interest in her, to Mariam's dismay. Laila is also informed that Tariq and his family have died on their way out of the city. Upon discovering that she is pregnant with Tariq's child, Laila agrees to marry Rasheed to protect herself and the baby, giving birth to a daughter, Aziza, whom Rasheed rejects and neglects for being a girl. Jealous of Laila and Rasheed's interest in her, Mariam initially is very cold, but gradually warms Laila as she attempts to cope with both Rasheed's abuse and the baby. The two become close friends and confidants, formulating a plan to run away from Rasheed and leave Kabul, but they are soon caught. Rasheed beats them both, locking them up separately and depriving them of water, almost killing Aziza. A few years later, the Taliban rises to power and imposes harsh rules on the Afghan population, severely curtailing women's rights. In a women's hospital that has been stripped of all supplies, Laila is forced to undergo a C-section without anesthesia to give birth to Rasheed's son, Zalmai. Laila and Mariam struggle with raising Zalmai, who Rasheed dotes on and favors greatly over Aziza. There is a drought, and living conditions in Kabul become poor. Rasheed's workshop burns down, and he is forced to take other jobs. He sends Aziza to an orphanage, and Laila endures a number of beatings from the Taliban when caught alone in attempts to visit her daughter. One day, Tariq appears at the house and is reunited with Laila, who realizes that Rasheed had hired the man to falsely inform her of Tariq's death so that she would agree to marry him. When Rasheed returns home from work, Zalmai tells him about the visitor. Suspicious of Laila and Tariq's relationship, Rasheed savagely beats Laila. He attempts to strangle her, but Mariam intervenes and kills him with a shovel, telling Laila and Tariq to run. Afterward, she confesses to killing Rasheed in order to draw attention away from them and is publicly executed. Laila and Tariq leave for Pakistan with Aziza and Zalmai, and spend their days working at a guest house in Murree, a summer retreat. After the fall of the Taliban, Laila and Tariq return to Afghanistan. They stop in the village where Mariam was raised and discover a package that Mariam's father left behind for her: a videotape of Pinocchio, a small sack of money, and a letter. Laila reads the letter and discovers that Jalil had regretted sending Mariam away, wishing that he had fought for her. Laila and Tariq return to Kabul and use the money to repair the orphanage Aziza had stayed in, where Laila starts working as a teacher. She becomes pregnant with her third child, and if it is a girl, vows to name her Mariam. Characters * Mariam is an ethnic Tajik born in Herat, 1959. She is the child of Jalil and Nana born out of wedlock. She suffers shame throughout her childhood because of the circumstances of her birth. Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: \\"The keyword with Mariam is that she is isolated in every sense of the word. She is a woman who is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence. Really, she just wants a connection with another human being.\\" Despite initially resenting Laila, she becomes a \\"friend and a doting alternative mother\\" to her through the \\"common hardship\\" of being married to the \\"abusive, psychologically imposing\\" Rasheed. * Laila is an ethnic Tajik. Born in 1978, to Hakim and Fariba, she is a beautiful and intelligent girl coming from a family in which the father is a university-educated and a teacher. Hosseini states that compared to Mariam, Laila \\"had a much more fulfilling relationship with her father, her boyfriends and her childhood friend, Tariq. She expected to finish school and is looking for personal fulfillment. These are two very different representations of women.\\" Her life becomes tied to Mariam's when she becomes the second wife of Rasheed, Mariam's husband. This originally draws resentment from Mariam, who \\"[feels] her territory infringed upon\\". Despite this, \\"Laila becomes her daughter for all practical purposes\\" due to Mariam's childlessness, struggles, and abuse they both face during the marriage. Towards the end of the novel she becomes a schoolteacher at the orphanage where Aziza had stayed. * Rasheed is an ethnic Pashtun, a shoemaker, and the antagonist of the novel. He marries Mariam through an arrangement with Jalil and later marries Laila as well. After suffering years of domestic abuse at his hands, Mariam bludgeons Rasheed to death with a shovel during a violent struggle. Hosseini stated that he hoped to create a multi-layered character in Rasheed, saying, \\"Rasheed's the embodiment of the patriarchal, tribal character. In writing him, I didn't want to write him as an irredeemable villain. He is a reprehensible person, but there are moments of humanity, such as his love for his son.\\" He identified an encounter with an Afghan man four years earlier as the foundation for this character; the man \\"had a very sweet, subservient wife\\" and had not yet informed her that he was planning to marry again. * Tariq, an ethnic Pashtun born in 1976, is a boy who grew up in Kabul with Laila. He lost a leg to a land mine at the age of five. They eventually evolve from best friends to lovers; after a decade of separation they are married and expecting a child by the end of the novel. * Nana is Mariam's mother and a former servant of Jalil. Mariam's birth is the result of an affair between Nana and Jalil. Jalil's favoritism towards his wives and legitimate children leaves Nana bitter towards Jalil. She hangs herself when Mariam is fifteen after Mariam journeys to Jalil's house on her birthday. Nana perceives this to be betrayal and regards as an act of desertion. * Mullah Faizullah, a Sufi, is Mariam's elderly Koran teacher and friend. He dies of natural causes in 1989. * Jalil is Mariam's father, a wealthy man who had three wives before he fathered Mariam. He marries Mariam to Rasheed after Nana's death, but later regrets sending her away. He dies in 1987. * Hakim is Laila's father. He is a well- educated and a progressive schoolteacher. He is killed in a rocket explosion along with Fariba. * Fariba is Laila's mother. In Part One, during her brief meeting with Mariam, she is depicted as cheerful, but her happy nature is disrupted when her two sons, Ahmad and Noor, leave home to go to war and are later killed. She spends nearly all of her time in bed mourning her sons until the Mujahideen are victorious, and is later killed in a rocket explosion along with Hakim. * Aziza, born in the spring of 1993, is the daughter of Laila and Tariq, conceived when Laila was fourteen. When the news of Tariq's alleged death arrives, in order to hide the child's illegitimacy and provide for herself, Laila decides to marry Rasheed. Aziza's birth marks the beginning of Laila's fall from favor with Rasheed and the friendship between Mariam and Laila. * Zalmai, born in September 1997, to Laila and Rasheed. He serves as a redeeming facet of Rasheed, idolizing him despite the abuse to his mother and Mariam. Zalmai remains unaware of the fact that Mariam killed Rasheed and continuously asks Laila about him, who lies by saying that he simply left for some time. After initially blaming Tariq for his father's mysterious disappearance, he comes to accept Tariq as a father-figure. Analysis=Family When asked about common themes in The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini replied: > \\"Both novels are multigenerational, and so the relationship between parent > and child, with all of its manifest complexities and contradictions, is a > prominent theme. I did not intend this, but I am keenly interested, it > appears, in the way parents and children love, disappoint, and in the end > honor each other. In one way, the two novels are corollaries: The Kite > Runner was a father-son story, and A Thousand Splendid Suns can be seen as a > mother-daughter story.\\" He ultimately considers both novels to be \\"love stories\\" in that it is love that \\"draws characters out of their isolation, that gives them the strength to transcend their own limitations, to expose their vulnerabilities, and to perform devastating acts of self-sacrifice\\". Women in Afghanistan Hosseini visited Afghanistan in 2003, and \\"heard so many stories about what happened to women, the tragedies that they had endured, the difficulties, the gender-based violence that they had suffered, the discrimination, the being barred from active life during the Taliban, having their movement restricted, being banned essentially from practicing their legal, social rights, political rights\\". This motivated him to write a novel centered on two Afghan women. Washington Post writer Jonathan Yardley suggests that \\"the central theme of A Thousand Splendid Suns is the place of women in Afghan society\\", pointing to a passage in which Mariam's mother states, \\"Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.\\" In the book, both Mariam and Laila are forced into accepting marriage to Rasheed, who requires them to wear a burqa before it is implemented by law under the Taliban. He later becomes increasingly abusive. A Riverhead Trades Weekly review states that the novel consistently shows the \\"patriarchal despotism where women are agonizingly dependent on fathers, husbands and especially sons, the bearing of male children being their sole path to social status.\\" Reception In the first week following its release, A Thousand Splendid Suns sold over one million copies, becoming a number-one New York Times bestseller for fifteen weeks. Time magazine's Lev Grossman placed it at number three in the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, and praised it as a \\"dense, rich, pressure-packed guide to enduring the unendurable.\\"Grossman, Lev; \\"The 10 Best Fiction Books\\"; Time magazine; December 24, 2007; Pages 44 - 45.Grossman, Lev; Top 10 Fiction Books; time.com Jonathan Yardley said in the Washington Post \\"Book World\\", \\"Just in case you're wondering whether Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns is as good as The Kite Runner, here's the answer: No. It's better.\\" A Thousand Splendid Suns received significant praise from reviewers, with Publishers Weekly calling it \\"a powerful, harrowing depiction of Afghanistan\\" and USA Today describing the prose as \\"achingly beautiful\\". Lisa See of The New York Times attributed the book's success to Hosseini \\"[understanding] the power of emotion as few other popular writers do\\". Natasha Walter from The Guardian wrote, \\"Hosseini is skilled at telling a certain kind of story, in which events that may seem unbearable - violence, misery and abuse - are made readable. He doesn't gloss over the horrors his characters live through, but something about his direct, explanatory style and the sense that you are moving towards a redemptive ending makes the whole narrative, for all its tragedies, slip down rather easily.\\" Cathleen Medwick gave the novel a highly positive review in O, the Oprah Magazine: > \\"Love may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you consider the > war-ravaged landscape of Afghanistan. But that is the emotion‚Äîsubterranean, > powerful, beautiful, illicit, and infinitely patient‚Äîthat suffuses the pages > of Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. As in his best-selling first > novel, The Kite Runner, Hosseini movingly examines the connections between > unlikely friends, the fissures that open up between parents and children, > the intransigence of quiet hearts.\\" The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani wrote a more critical review, describing the opening as \\"heavy-handed\\" and early events in the novel as \\"soap-opera-ish\\". Despite these objections, she concluded, \\"Gradually, however, Mr. Hosseini's instinctive storytelling skills take over, mowing down the reader's objections through sheer momentum and will. He succeeds in making the emotional reality of Mariam and Laila's lives tangible to us, and by conjuring their day-to-day routines, he is able to give us a sense of what daily life was like in Kabul ‚Äî both before and during the harsh reign of the Taliban.\\" Similarly, Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor concluded that A Thousand Splendid Suns was ultimately \\"a little shaky as a work of literature\\". The depictions of the lead female characters, Mariam and Laila, were praised by several commentators. John Freeman from The Houston Chronicle found them \\"enormously winning\\" while Carol Memmott from USA Today further described them as \\"stunningly heroic characters whose spirits somehow grasp the dimmest rays of hope\\". Medwick summed up the portrayals: \\"Mariam, branded as a harami, or bastard, and forced into an abusive marriage at the age of fifteen, and Laila, a beauty groomed for success but shrouded almost beyond recognition by repressive sharia law and the husband she and Mariam share. The story, epic in scope and spanning three decades, follows these two indomitable women whose fortunes mirror those of their beloved and battered country‚Äî'nothing pretty to look at, but still standing'‚Äîand who find in each other the strength they need to survive.\\" Jennifer Reese from Entertainment Weekly dubbed Rasheed \\"one of the most repulsive males in recent literature\\". Lisa See wrote that, with the exception of Tariq, \\"the male characters seem either unrelentingly evil or pathetically weak\\" and opined, \\"If a woman wrote these things about her male characters, she would probably be labeled a man- hater.\\" On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed A Thousand Splendid Suns on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels. Adaptations Columbia Pictures owns the movie rights to the novel.

The film is inspired by the true story of the MIT Blackjack Team as told in Bringing Down the House, the best-selling book by Ben Mezrich. Despite its largely mixed reviews and controversy over the film's casting choices, 21 was a box office success, and was the number one film in the United States and Canada during its first and second weekends of release. Plot Ben, a mathematics major at MIT, is accepted into Harvard Medical School but cannot afford the $300,000 tuition. He applies for the prestigious Robinson Scholarship which would cover the entire cost. However, despite having an MCAT score of 44 and high grades, he faces fierce competition, and is told by the director that the scholarship will only go to whichever student dazzles him. Back at MIT, a professor, Micky Rosa challenges Ben with the Monty Hall Problem which he solves successfully. After looking at Ben's 97% score on his latest non-linear equations test, Micky invites Ben to join his blackjack team, which consists of fellow students Choi, Fisher, Jill, and Kianna. Using card counting and covert signalling, they are able to increase their probability of winning while at casinos, leading them to earn substantial profits. Over many weekends, the team is flown to Las Vegas and Ben comes to enjoy his luxurious lifestyle as a so-called big player. The team is impressed by Ben's skill, but Fisher becomes jealous and fights him while drunk, leading Micky to expel him. Meanwhile, the head of security, Cole Williams, has been monitoring the team and begins to turn his attention to Ben. Ben's devotion to blackjack causes him to neglect his role in an engineering competition, which estranges him from his friends. During the next trip to Las Vegas, he is emotionally distracted and fails to walk away from the table when signaled, causing him to lose his earnings of $200,000. Micky is angered and quits the team, demanding that Ben must repay $200,000. Ben and three of the students decide that they will continue to play blackjack without Micky, but they are caught by Williams, whom Micky tipped off. Williams beats up Ben and warns him not to return. Ben learns that he is ineligible for graduation because his course taught by an associate of Micky's is marked as incomplete (with Micky's influence, the professor initially gives Ben a passing grade throughout the year without him having to work or even show up to class). Furthermore, his winnings are stolen from his dormitory room. Suspecting Micky, Ben confers with the other blackjack students, and they persuade Micky to make a final trip to Las Vegas before the casinos install biometric software. The team puts on disguises and returns to Planet Hollywood, winning $640,000 before they are spotted by Williams. Micky flees with the bag of chips, jumping into a limousine, but realizes it was a setup when he discovers that the chips are fake. It is revealed that Ben and Williams made a deal to lure Micky to Las Vegas so that Williams may capture and beat him, because Williams has past grievances against him. Williams proceeds to hold Micky hostage and subject him to beatings. In exchange, Williams allows Ben to play for one more night in Las Vegas, enjoying immunity from capture. However, as Ben is leaving with his earnings, Williams betrays him and takes the bag of chips at gunpoint. Ben protests, and Williams explains that he needs retirement funds, whereas intelligent people like Ben will always find a way to succeed. However, Ben's long-time friends (with whom he has reconciled) Miles and Cam also turn out to be quite good at card- counting while working with Choi and Kianna during Micky's capture and as such, the now 6-man team make a lot of money despite Williams's robbery of Ben and Micky's chips. The film ends with Ben recounting the entire tale to the dazzled and dumbfounded scholarship director. CastProduction The filming of 21 began in March 2007. Principal filming of the Las Vegas scenes took place at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, the Red Rock Casino, and the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas. Filming also took place at Harvard Medical School, Chinatown, in Cambridge, and the Christian Science Center in Boston, Massachusetts. As Massachusetts Institute of Technology did not allow filming on campus, the MIT school and dorm interiors, the gymnasium, and the alumni reception were all shot at Boston University. Reception=Critical response Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 36% of 169 critics gave the film a positive review, for an average rating of 5.17/10.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Box office In its opening weekend, the film grossed $24,105,943 in 2,648 theaters in the United States and Canada, averaging $9,103 per venue and ranking first at the box office.

Casting controversy A race-based controversy arose over the decision to make the majority of the characters white Americans, even though the main players in the book Bringing Down the House, upon which the film 21 is based, were mainly Asian-Americans. The lead role was given to London-born Jim Sturgess, who required a dialect coach to speak with an American accent. Jeff Ma, who was the real-life inspiration for the character Ben Campbell and served as a consultant on the film, was attacked as being a \\"race traitor\\" on several blogs for not insisting that his character be Asian-American. In response, Ma said, \\"I'm not sure they understand how little control I had in the movie-making process; I didn't get to cast it.\\" Ma said that the controversy was \\"overblown\\" and that the important aspect is that a talented actor would portray him. Ma, who is Chinese American, told USA Today, \\"I would have been a lot more insulted if they had chosen someone who was Japanese or Korean, just to have an Asian playing me.\\" Nick Rogers of The Enterprise wrote, \\"The real-life students mostly were Asian-Americans, but 21 whitewashes its cast and disappointingly lumps its only Asian-American actors (Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira) into one-note designations as the team's kleptomaniac and a slot-playing 'loser.'\\" The Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) reported on their web site: \\"After the 'white-washing' issue was raised on Entertainment Weeklys web site, [21] producer Dana Brunetti wrote: \\"Believe me, I would have LOVED to cast Asians in the lead roles, but the truth is, we didn't have access to any bankable Asian-American actors that we wanted.\\" Home media 21 was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Region 1 on July 21, 2008. Reaction from casinos In pre-production, the producers and the book's original writers predicted that the Vegas casinos would be unhelpful, as a film that told viewers the basics of card counting might hurt their bottom line. A featurette included with the DVD completely and accurately describes the \\"Hi-Lo\\" system used by the MIT Blackjack Club and by Rosa's team in the film. In fact, the writers were surprised when told by the producers that MGM Studios would finance the film, though all \\"MGM\\" casinos (including one used by the real MIT Blackjack Team) are owned by MGM Resorts International and are no longer related to MGM Studios. In reality, as another DVD featurette reveals, the casinos (including MGM Resorts) saw the film as an attention-getter; people who saw it would be encouraged to go to Vegas and play: some just for fun and some attempting to count cards but failing to learn or memorize the entire strategy or making too many mistakes. The film withheld critical strategy details (such as the conversion from the \\"running count\\" to a \\"true count\\"), and most beginning card counters underestimate the number and value of the mistakes they make.

Al-Masri was implicated in the 2006 Transatlantic Aircraft Plot, which was to be carried out by a terrorist cell operating in London, but which was orchestrated by al-Qaeda's central leadership. Biography Al-Masri was Egyptian (the epithet literally means 'the Egyptian') but he received combat experience, and terrorist and insurgent training in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya. Al-Masri was thought to be a provincial al-Qaeda commander in Afghanistan, but according to The New York Times, \\"[al-Masri] emerged as one of Al Qaeda's senior operatives after the death of Abu Hamza Rabia, another Egyptian who was killed by a missile strike in Pakistan in 2005.\\" The information about al-Masri's ascendency through the al-Qaeda leadership allegedly came from interrogations of al-Qaeda operatives captured in Pakistan. Al-Masri was suspected of helping recruit and train operatives who carried out the 7 July 2005 London Bombings. According to American intelligence officials, he was also suspected of involvement in the foiled plan to blow up airliners over the Atlantic Ocean in 2006. Al-Masri lived in Germany before going to Afghanistan to join the Mujahadeen. After Afghanistan, he returned to Germany to begin building a network in Europe. In 2006, two attempts were made by coalition forces to kill him. Death According to U.S. government counterterrorism sources, al-Masri is believed to have died in December 2007, in Pakistan's tribal region, probably due to hepatitis.

Named for counties in Kansas and Missouri established in honor of David Rice Atchison, a mid-19th century Democratic United States Senator from Missouri, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-60 was laid down on 14 November 1943 at Neville Island, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 24 December; sponsored by Mrs. Daniel W. Mack; and placed in reduced commission on 24 January 1944 so that she might descend the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers under her own power to New Orleans where she was placed in full commission on 7 February with Lieutenant Carl E. Ellis in command. Service history The new tank landing ship held shakedown training off Panama City, Florida, from 19 February to 4 March; then returned to New Orleans for repairs and loading. She next moved to New York City, where she took additional cargo on board for transportation to the United Kingdom. After crossing the Atlantic in convoy, LST-60 safely arrived in Falmouth, England, on 2 May. From there, she proceeded to Southend- on-Sea to load for the Normandy invasion. LST-60 sailed from Southend on 5 June with Commander, Group 3, embarked for the initial assault. Following successful unloading of troops and cargo at Normandy the next day, the ship commenced cross-channel operations, making 53 trips to the French mainland without mishap before being ordered back to the United States for overhaul. Escorting a convoy en route, LST-60 safely arrived in Norfolk on 1 July 1945 and continued on to New Orleans for repairs. Originally scheduled to join the Pacific Fleet following overhaul, LST-60 received new orders with the end of the war on 15 August. Instead, she proceeded to Green Cove Springs, Florida for inactivation and was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 June 1946. The name USS Atchison County was assigned to LST-60 on 1 July 1955. In 1958, the tank landing ship was declared unfit for further naval service. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1958; her final fate is unknown. LST-60 earned one battle star for World War II service.

Stone (born Gerschon Lichtenstein, May 18, 1903 ‚Äì May 26, 1967) was a Polish-born American character actor in movies, radio, and television. Career Director Frank Borzage (center) on the battlefield set of 7th Heaven with cast members (from left) Charles Farrell, George E. Stone (reclining), √âmile Chautard and David Butler (1927) Poster for The Big Brain (1933) starring Stone (lower left) He was born Gerschon Lichtenstein in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Congress Poland into a Jewish family. He sailed from the Port of Hamburg, Germany, as a steerage passenger on board the S/S President Grant, which arrived at the Port of New York on May 29, 1913; at Ellis Island, he passed federal immigrant inspection with his two sisters and a brother. As an actor, Stone's slight build and very expressive face first attracted attention in the 1927 silent-film 7th Heaven, where he played the local street thug The Sewer Rat. Originally billed as Georgie Stone, he made a successful transition to talking pictures in Warner Bros.' Tenderloin, speaking in a pleasant, slightly nasal tenor. Stone was then typecast in streetwise roles, often playing a Runyonesque mobster or a gangland boss's assistant. He was best known as Rico Bandello's right-hand man Otero in the gangster classic Little Caesar (1931). He adopted a dapper pencil moustache for these screen roles. One of his most famous appearances was in the classic musical 42nd Street (1933), in which wiseguy Stone assesses a promiscuous chorus girl: \\"She only said 'no' once, and then she didn't hear the question!\\" His one starring film (as George E. Stone) was the Universal Pictures gangster comedy The Big Brain (1933). In 1939, comedy producer Hal Roach hired Stone for his film The Housekeeper's Daughter. It was a difficult role: Stone had to play a mentally retarded murderer in a sweet, sympathetic manner. Stone went clean-shaven, emphasizing a boyish, innocent look, and played the part so sensitively that Roach often cast him in other films. In 1942, Stone burlesqued Hirohito in Roach's wartime comedy The Devil with Hitler. Stone's most familiar role was \\"The Runt\\", loyal sidekick to adventurous ex-criminal Boston Blackie in Columbia Pictures' action-comedies. Stone was supposed to perform with Chester Morris in the first film of the series, Meet Boston Blackie, but was sidelined by a virus. Actor Charles Wagenheim filled in for him, and Stone joined the series in the second entry, Confessions of Boston Blackie. Stone's performances in the Blackies were well received, and he enthusiastically played scenes for laughs (doing dialects, disguising in women's clothes, posing as a child, or reacting in wide-eyed amazement or frustration to each story's twists and turns). Both Chester Morris and George E. Stone reprised their screen roles for one year in the Boston Blackie radio series. In the 1942 film Little Tokyo, U.S.A., he played the Japanese agent, Kingoro. Even in his smallest roles, Stone made an impression. In the 1945 newspaper-themed feature Midnight Manhunt, he plays a murder victim who doesn't say a word but expires eloquently. Another tiny role has Stone contributing to the perennial holiday favorite Miracle on 34th Street ‚Äì but not in the film. He appears in the coming-attractions trailer, as an openly cynical screenwriter confronted by a bossy movie producer. Stone made guest appearances in movies and television through the 1950s, in situation comedies (The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show) and action- adventure shows (Adventures of Superman, as mob leader \\"Big George\\"). When it came to playing tough guys, Stone could be just as convincing as the biggest, brawniest men. In the feature film The Man with the Golden Arm, Stone is the vindictive mobster who has been cheated at cards, and attacks dealer Frank Sinatra's friend Arnold Stang in a brutal fistfight. Stone's vision deteriorated in the late 1950s, limiting him to walk-on roles or undemanding character parts. He plays nervous stool pigeon \\"Toothpick Charlie\\" in Billy Wilder's comedy hit Some Like It Hot, and became a TV regular in the popular Perry Mason series, in the minor role of court clerk. One of Stone's closest friends was reporter-humorist Damon Runyon. Stone often appeared in movie adaptations of Runyon's work; his last film, Pocketful of Miracles (1961), cast Stone as a blind beggar. Illness and death Throughout his career, Stone was sidelined by illness. In 1936, he fell ill with pneumonia and lost out on a film role. He was also sidelined by a virus and was unable to film the first of Columbia's fourteen Boston Blackie pictures (1941‚Äì49) with Chester Morris. He fell ill again in 1948, and in the early 1950s began losing his sight to the point of almost total darkness in both eyes. He told The Daily Mirror on November 1958, ‚ÄúTo me, it meant the end of everything I‚Äôd taken for granted.‚Äù In 1958, he underwent surgery to save his sight. In fact, his sight was so limited by the time that he played the county clerk on Perry Mason that he had to be led around the set by his co-stars. After suffering a major stroke in 1966 which left him bedridden and unable to speak, Stone spent the majority of his last year of life at the Motion Picture Country Home until he died May 26, 1967. Accolades  For his contributions to motion pictures, Stone received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His resting place is at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery.

This species used to belong to the Stylidium graminifolium complex, but the name was conserved for this single species when two others were split from the complex and introduced as new species in 2001.Jackson, W.D. and Wiltshire, R.J.E. (2001). Historical taxonomy and a resolution of the Stylidium graminifolium complex (Stylidiaceae) in Tasmania. Australian Systematic Botany, 14(6): 937-969. S. graminifolium is endemic to Australia and is one of the Stylidium species with the widest distribution throughout Australia.Darnowski, Douglas W. (2002). Triggerplants. Australia: Rosenberg Publishing. It is a perennial plant with grass-like leaves and is easily cultivated. It has been considered to be a carnivorous or protocarnivorous plant because it possesses glandular trichomes underneath the flowers that can trap and digest prey. Description This species is an erect perennial herb with 5‚Äì40 cm (2‚Äì8 in) long narrow, grass- like leaves that appear from a basal rosette. A 15‚Äì90 cm (6‚Äì36 in) long scape bearing the racemous inflorescence appears in the spring and summer (October through February). The flowers are butterfly shaped and pale or bright pink with petals paired laterally. The calyx and corolla are both covered in glandular trichomes. The pollination mechanism involving a sensitive \\"trigger\\"‚Äîa floral column, in which the stamen and style are fused‚Äîis unique to the family Stylidiaceae. In S. graminifolium, the column is red and stamens are a greenish color.Erickson, Rica. (1958). Triggerplants. Paterson Brokensha Pty. Ltd.: Perth, W.A. This species, like most Stylidium species, possesses glandular trichomes underneath the flower and on the scape, which are capable of digesting and absorbing nutrients from prey captured in the sticky mucilage. This information leads some researchers to believe that the plants are carnivorous or at the very least protocarnivorous.Darnowski, D.W., Carroll, D.M., P≈Çachno, B., Kabanoff, E., and Cinnamon, E. (2006). Evidence of protocarnivory in triggerplants (Stylidium spp.; Stylidiaceae). Plant Biology, 8(6): 805-812. (Abstract online: HTML)  Distribution and habitat  S. graminifolium has one of the widest ranges in the genus Stylidium, extending from Tasmania to Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland over to South Australia. Its most common habitat is dry sclerophyll forests with nutrient- poor soil conditions. S. graminifolium from Curtis's Botanical Magazine, 1817, plate 1918. Taxonomy Stylidium graminifolium was one of only four Stylidium species collected in 1770 from Botany Bay when Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander joined James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Endeavour.Stearn, William T. (1969). A Royal Society Appointment with Venus in 1769: The Voyage of Cook and Banks in the 'Endeavour' in 1768-1771 and Its Botanical Results. Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 24(1): 64-90. It was first formally described by Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1805. It was again described by Olof Swartz just two years later in 1807 under the same name. Around the same time, other botanists were considering placing these new species in the new genus Candollea, which would be in the family Dilleniaceae, but Stylidium was retained as the older nomenclature and placed in its own family, Stylidiaceae.The International Plant Names Index. (2004). Stylidium. Accessed 2 April 2007.  Stylidium graminifolium complex  After S. graminifolium was discovered and formally described, new forms and varieties were added to what came to be known as the Stylidium graminifolium complex, a group of plants that has been treated as a single species but may have significant morphological differences that require the complex to be split into new species. The complex was formally split into three species in 2001, with S. graminifolium lectotypified from the collections of Banks and Solander in the 1770s. S. graminifolium sensu stricto is more narrow-leaved and is diploid (2n = 30). The other two species, S. dilatatum and S. armeria, that used to be included in this complex are tetraploid (2n = 60) and may represent polyploid speciation. The three species also represented different habitats and ranges, with S. graminifolium distributed widely in south-eastern continental Australia and Tasmania, S. dilatatum in the subalpine areas of south-eastern Australia and widely distributed in Tasmania, and S. armeria in the littoral habitats in Tasmania from Macquarie Harbour to the Tasman Peninsula. Cultivation S. graminifolium in cultivation. Stylidium graminifolium is one of the few Stylidium species commercially available for sale as seed. This species, along with six other triggerplants, was tested for horticultural value and cold hardiness by Douglas Darnowski in the United States from 2000 to 2002. Dr. Darnowski's study concluded that S. graminifolium was able to survive cold temperatures down to -10¬∞C, making it suitable for growing outside in as low as USDA hardiness zone 8. Darnowski also postulated that S. graminifolium's attractive floral spikes could be of use in floriculture and could be used to replace purple loosestrife in winter and spring arrangements. It has a relatively long flowering period and has somewhat specific conditions for germination, including smoke treatments and higher temperatures to simulate a bushfire, though germination can occur without these conditions. These germination requirements reduce the risk that it will become an invasive species. It is also able to grow on nutrient-poor soils and withstand significant drought. These attributes increase its potential for floricultural use.Darnowski, D.W. (2003). Triggerplants (Stylidium; Stylidiaceae): A new floral and horticultural crop with preliminary analysis of hardiness. Proceedings of the XXVI International Horticultural Congress, Toronto, Canada 11‚Äì17 August 2002; Elegant Science in Floriculture, Acta Hort., 624: 93-101. There are two cultivars of S. graminifolium, Tiny Trina and Little Saphire, that are tentatively recognized cultivar names by the Royal Horticultural Society.Royal Horticultural Society database search for S. graminifolium 'Tiny Trina'. Accessed 21 April 2007.Royal Horticultural Society database search for S. graminifolium 'Little Saphire'. Accessed 21 April 2007. The epithet Little Saphire is derived from the bright blue foliage that distinguishes this cultivar from the type species.

The piece is written for solo violin and orchestra. The opera premiered at the Op√©ra Garnier in Paris on March 16, 1894.  Description  The M√©ditation is an instrumental entr'acte performed between the scenes of Act II in the opera Tha√Øs. In the first scene of Act II, Athana√´l, a Cenobite monk, confronts Tha√Øs, a beautiful and hedonistic courtesan and devot√©e of Venus, and attempts to persuade her to leave her life of luxury and pleasure and find salvation through God. It is during a time of reflection following the encounter that the M√©ditation is played by the orchestra. In the second scene of Act II, following the M√©ditation, Tha√Øs tells Athana√´l that she will follow him to the desert. The piece is in D major and is approximately five minutes long (although there are a number of interpretations that stretch the piece to over six minutes). Massenet may also have written the piece with religious intentions; the tempo marking is Andante religioso, signifying his intention that it should be played religiously (which could mean either strictly in the tempo or literally with religiously- founded emotion) and at walking tempo, or around 60 BPM. The piece opens with a short introduction by the harps, with the solo violin quickly entering with the motif. After the violin plays the melody twice, the piece goes into a section marked animato, gradually becoming more and more passionate (Massenet wrote poco a poco appassionato). The climax is reached at a place marked poco piu appassionato (a little more passion) and is then followed by a short cadenza-like passage from the soloist and returns to the main theme. After the theme is played twice, the soloist joins the orchestra while playing harmonics on the upper register as the harps and strings quietly play below the solo line.  Orchestration  The piece calls for solo violin, two flutes, two oboes, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, contrabassoon, 2 horns, SATB chorus, two harps and strings. The solo violin part is generally played by the orchestra's concertmaster in an opera setting, or by a featured soloist standing in front of the orchestra in a concert setting. The SATB chorus is indicated by Massenet to be sung by the entire chorus from behind the curtain in an opera setting, and by four to eight soloists seated among the orchestra in a concert setting. Other arrangements have also been made, such as the variation for the violin and piano.  Performers and adaptations  The M√©ditation from Tha√Øs is considered to be one of the great encore pieces; world-class violin soloists such as Michael Rabin, Anne Akiko Meyers, Joshua Bell, Sarah Chang, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Itzhak Perlman, David Garrett and Maxim Vengerov have performed the piece as soloists with major orchestras throughout the world. The M√©ditation has been transcribed for violin and piano and for other instruments as well. The cellist Yo-Yo Ma and pianist Kathryn Stott have recorded a version for cello and piano by Jules Delsart; the flautist James Galway, the euphoniumist Adam Frey, and trumpeter Sergei Nakariakov have also performed and recorded separate versions on their respective instruments, each with orchestral accompaniment. Jazz bass saxophonist Adrian Rollini quoted the opening bars of the melody in a 1925 recording of Milenburg Joys with the Varsity Eight, although he did play it in the key of D-flat major, a semitone lower than the original composition.  Choreography  The British choreographer Frederick Ashton created a balletic pas de deux from the M√©ditation. Premiered on 21 March 1971, the piece was created on Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell of The Royal Ballet and performed at the Adelphi Theatre as part of a Gala Performance. The piece is not related to the plot of the opera, but resembles a vision scene, with Sibley resembling \\"a disembodied, weightless spirit\\",Vaughan, p. 379 and features costumes by Dowell. It was so well received at its first performance that Ashton had to announce an immediate encore, and Marie Rambert considered it one of Ashton's three masterpieces (along with Symphonic Variations and La fille mal gard√©e). There is a recording of the piece that was shown on BBC Television and the pas de deux was featured in the international cinema screening The Royal Ballet Dances Frederick Ashton from the Royal Opera House in 2013.

Career After World War II Benveniste, at this time known as Albert, lived in Paris and in 1948 co- founded the Zero Press with George Solomos (who was then known as Thermistocles Hoetis). Their first publication in spring 1949 was Zero Magazine.Zero: A Review of Literature and Art. One of the poets they published was Lionel Ziprin, whose recollections of Benveniste appeared in Jewish Quarterly: \\"'He was a Turkish Jew; he had a very good poetry magazine, called The Trigram. I knew him in college; he went into the army. Later, he stayed in Paris. ...He and a guy called Themistocles Hoetis, this guy George Solomos, published a magazine called Zero; George came to New York, and he said: Give us what you got.

Following the second issue of Zero, which featured work by Paul Bowles, James Baldwin and Matta, Benveniste moved to London, then later Cornwall and Kent where he wrote a full length radio play \\"Tangier for the Traveller\\" for the BBC Home Service. Besides being a poet, he also worked as a printer, a typographer, and as a book designer. In London during 1965, he co-founded and managed the pioneering Trigram Press, which published work by George Barker, Tom Raworth, Jack Hirschman, J. H. Prynne, David Meltzer, B. S. Johnson, Jim Dine, Jeff Nuttall, Gavin Ewart, Ivor Cutler, Anselm Hollo, and Lee Harwood, among others.Trigram Press Archive In the 1980s Benveniste and his second partner Agnetha Falk moved to Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, where they operated a secondhand bookshop.Iain Sinclair, London: City of Disappearances, London: Hamish Hamilton, 2006. When he died in 1990, Benveniste was buried in the graveyard of Heptonstall church, with a gravestone that reads: \\"Foolish Enough to Have Been a Poet\\". He was both pleased and amused that his grave was to be within speaking distance of Sylvia Plath's own gravestone a few feet away. Gabriel Gudding blog , October 10, 2006. The artist Pip (Penelope) Benveniste, Asa's first wife, was also his partner in the Trigram Press project and provided the funds for its establishment. Pip's middle son (and Asa's stepson) Paul Vaughan was the highly skilled printer at Trigram Press, operating the classic Gutenberg Printing Press to a very high standard and developing groundbreaking results with silkscreen images for books, limited edition prints and other outlets. Pip died on August 30, 2010 (see Guardian obituary, September 16, 2010); she is now recognised as an important post-war British modernist painter.

An illness in Wittman's infancy claimed most of his vision in one eye, which convinced him from an early age that his dream of flying was unattainable.National Aviation Hall of Fame inductee However, he learned how to fly in 1924 in a Standard J-1 and built his first aircraft, the Harley-powered \\"Hardly Abelson\\"http://museum.eaa.org/collection/aircraft/Wittman%20Hardly%20Abelson.asp#TopOfPage in late 1924. From 1925 to 1927, he had his own flying service, giving joyrides, and during this time also became a demonstration and test pilot for The Pheasant Aircraft Company and Dayton Aircraft Company, flying the Pheasant H-10 in multiple events. He also began his air-racing career, flying his first race in 1926 at a Milwaukee event in his J-1. After competing in his first transcontinental air race from New York to Los Angeles in 1928, he attained a medical waiver on his eyesight and received his pilot's certificate soon after (signed by Orville Wright). Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame Inductee http://www.wisconsinaviationhalloffame.org/inductees/wittman.htm He then went on to design, build and pilot his own aircraft, including \\"Chief Oshkosh\\" in 1931 and \\"Bonzo\\" in 1934. Wittman's first race in an aircraft design that was his was in \\"Bonzo\\", in the 1935 Thompson Trophy race, where he placed second. In 1937, piloting his second homebuilt, \\"Chief Oshkosh\\", Wittman placed second in the Greve Trophy Race. Wittman flew \\"Bonzo\\" in the Thompson Trophy race, and he led for the first 18 laps of the 20 lap race, at an average speed of over 275 mph (442.57 km/h). Suddenly his engine began to run rough, and Wittman was forced to throttle back to remain in the race, finishing in 5th place. In 1938, he was awarded the Louis Bl√©riot medal by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI). Also in 1937, Wittman designed and built \\"Buttercup\\". A high wing design built to outperform the Cubs, Chiefs, T-Crafts, and Luscombes of the day. Based on that aircraft, he built the Wittman Big X in 1945, and the popular Wittman Tailwind series of homebuilts. During World War II, his Wittman Flying Service was part of the Civilian Pilot Training Program, training pilots for the Army Air Corps. After the war, Wittman finished eighth in the 1946 Thompson Trophy race with a clipped-wing Bell P-63 Kingcobra fighter. In 1947, Bill Brennand won the inaugural Goodyear class race at the National Air Races piloting Wittman's 'Buster'. \\"Buster\\" was a rebuild of the pre-war \\"Chief Oshkosh\\", went on to win many more Goodyear/Continental Trophy races, and was retired after the 1954 Dansville, New York air races. It is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Wittman built an entirely new \\"Bonzo\\" for the 1948 National Air Races, where he flew it, finishing third. Wittman raced \\"Bonzo\\" through the 1950s and 1960s, including the first few Reno National Championship air races, before retiring from Formula One competition in 1973. \\"Bonzo\\" is now displayed next to Wittman's prewar \\"Bonzo\\" in the EAA Aviation Museum, along with several other Wittman airplanes. Wittman was manager of the Oshkosh, Wisconsin airport from 1931 to 1969, which is now named after him (Wittman Regional Airport). Wittman became involved in the newly formed Experimental Aircraft Association in 1953 and was instrumental in bringing the EAA's annual fly-in to the Oshkosh Airport in 1970. He designed and built the Wittman V-Witt to compete in the new Formula V Air Racing class. He competed in races with that aircraft until 1979. Winners of the Formula V National Championship are presented with the Steve Wittman Trophy. Wittman remained active in aviation his entire life. For Wittman's 90th birthday celebration, he demonstrated aerobatic maneuvers in his V-Witt and Oldsmobile-powered Tailwind. He also used \\"Buttercup\\" to give Young Eagles flights. Letters of appreciation were given by President Bill Clinton and Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson. Steve married Dorthy Rady in 1941. He taught her to fly and she accompanied him to most of his races. Dorthy died in 1991 and Wittman married Paula Muir in 1992. On April 27, 1995, Wittman and Muir took off for a routine cross-country flight from their winter residence in Ocala, Florida to their summer residence in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Wittman \\"O&O;\\" N41SW (41 for 1941, year of his first marriage, plus SW, his initials) crashed five miles south of Stevenson, Alabama, killing both Wittman and Muir. The cause was improper installation of the wing fabric, causing it to debond, resulting in aileron/wing flutter.National Transportation Safety Board, Accident ID ATL95FA092 In 2014, Wittman was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

In the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it is called ghol. It is called moru ‡¥Æ‡µã‡¥∞‡µç in Tamil and Malayalam, taak ‡§§‡§æ‡§ï in Marathi, majjiga in Telugu, majjige in Kannada, ale (pronounced a-lay) in Tulu. It is often called laban in the Old Dhaka in Bangladesh. In Indian English, it is often referred to as buttermilk. Preparation and variations Chaas is made by churning yogurt (curds/dahi) and cold water together in a pot, using a hand-held instrument called madhani (whipper). This can be consumed plain or seasoned with a variety of spices. Chaas can be made from fresh yogurt, and the natural flavour of such chaas is mildly sweet. This type of chaas is very close to lassi, with two major differences: chaas is more dilute (with water) than lassi and unlike lassi, chaas does not have added sugar. Although chaas can be made from fresh yogurt (curds/dahi), it is more commonly made at home from yogurt that is a few days old and has become sour due to age. Indeed, one of the purposes for making chaas at home is to usefully finish off old yogurt that is lying in the fridge for long. Such chaas has a tangy, slightly sour taste which is considered delicious. A pinch of salt is usually added to it for further enhancement of taste, and other seasonings can be added also, as described below. A third variation of chaas is obtained by adding actual buttermilk (water left over after churning butter) into the chaas. This gives a slightly sour-bitter taste to the final product, and it is necessary to add seasonings to mask these flavours. Chaas made using buttermilk is very healthy but the taste is not relished by all. However, if proper seasonings and spices are used, it can be delicious. This type of chaas is more unusual and rare compared to the other types, because it is available only when butter is churned at home. Seasoning and flavours Chaas can be consumed plain, but a little salt is usually added. This is the most common seasoning for chaas. Numerous other seasonings and spices can be added to salted chaas, either singly or in combination with each other. These spices are usually roasted in a wok, using a spoonful of cooking oil, before being added to the Chaas. The spices which can be added thus are: Coarsely ground and roasted cumin seeds, curry leaves, asafoetida, grated ginger, very finely diced green chillies and Mustard seeds. Sugar can also be added to chaas, but if sugar is added, then neither salt nor spice can be used. Adding sugar to chaas makes it very similar to lassi, the main difference being that chaas is more dilute (with water) than lassi. Lassi is more popular in Punjab and certain regions of north India, while chaas (known by various named) is popular in all other parts of the country. Vendors have come up with several proprietary products and standardized flavours of chaas which are produced on an industrial scale and sold as bottled drinks. The best-seller among such brands is Amul's Masala Chaas, which has standardized several traditional flavours for the mass bottled-drink market. Other popular modern flavours available as bottled drinks include rose-flavoured Chaas Gulabi and mint- flavoured Mint Chaas. Both have added sugar and differ from flavoured lassi in being more dilute and less expensive. Consumption In India, the consumption of chaas has cultural resonances and associations which are not found in the context of other beverages like tea, coffee or lassi. An earthen pot is used to prepare chaas and store it for a few hours before consumption. The use of an earthen pot makes the chaas cool even in summer. In the extremely hot desert areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan, people consume chaas with salt after getting exposed to the sun because this may aid rehydration. Chaas or Moru is consumed more in Southern India as it rehydrates your body from the hot climatic condition. Chaas is consumed all year round. It is usually taken immediately after meals, but is also consumed on its own as a beverage.

Transmission Gully is a chain of steep-sided, isolated valleys in the Wellington Region of New Zealand, running approximately north-south between the Kapiti Coast and Tawa, through hills east of Porirua. The gully's name comes from the 110,000-volt transmission line that formerly ran through it. The line was built in 1924, linking Wellington to the Mangahao hydroelectric station near Shannon, and later to the wider North Island transmission grid. Despite lying mostly within the boundaries of Porirua City, Transmission Gully is sparsely populated, and most of the land is farmland, forest, or scrub. There are some areas with lifestyle blocks, particularly near Pauatahanui, and Transmission Gully is also home to Battle Hill Farm Forest Park. In 1879 a proposed Haywards‚ÄìPlimmerton Line railway route north from Wellington was to use these valleys but was never built. The only road access through Transmission Gully is the narrow and winding Paekakariki Hill Road. Beginning at Paekakariki, it travels up and over the western ridge of Transmission Gully, and then gradually descends the western bank along most of the length of the gully to Pauatahanui. The Transmission Gully Motorway travels through the gully and is currently under construction. It will eventually become part of State Highway 1 when it is scheduled to be completed in late 2020. The motorway was begun as part of the Wellington Northern Corridor portion of the former National Government's Roads of National Significance package of new state highways. It will not, however, offer any access to the gully itself, as no on- or off-ramps are planned to be constructed between Pauatahanui and MacKay's Crossing, north of Paekakariki.

Saratoga Passage lies in Puget Sound between Whidbey Island and Camano Island. Saratoga Passage extends about 18 miles in a northwesterly direction from its entrance between Sandy Point on the Whidbey Island side and Camano Head on the other. At its northern end, Saratoga Passage connects with Penn Cove and Crescent Harbor, and leads east into Skagit Bay. Depths in the passage are from about 600 feet at the southeastern entrance to about 90 feet near Crescent Harbor. Langley, Washington is the only city on either island located on the passage. Most of the waterfront on either side is high bank of forested sand and clay banks. There are four low bank communities on the Whidbey Island side of the passage: Sandy Point, Langley, Bells Beach and Fox Spit. The beaches are gravel and sand and the tide generally runs out a good distance. There is considerable maritime traffic in these waters, mostly recreational and fishing boats, with occasional tugs bound to or from Deception Pass or the Swinomish Channel. High-speed passenger ferries running between Seattle, Victoria and Friday Harbor use Saratoga Passage and Deception Pass as an alternative to crossing the Strait of Juan de Fuca in rough weather. This area is generally considered a resort area. Dungeness crab, clams and flatfish are abundant. In the past, strong salmon runs passed through on the way to the rivers on the mainland, but they have all but disappeared as have the once plentiful bait of candlefish and herring. Most of the fishing in southern end of Whidbey Island takes place on the western side, in Possession Sound, Mutiny Bay, or Double Bluff. Saratoga Passage was named by Charles Wilkes, during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838‚Äì1842, for the Saratoga, the flagship of Thomas MacDonough during the Battle of Lake Champlain of the War of 1812. Wilkes had named Camano Island MacDonough Island, to honor the naval commander, but that name was removed when Henry Kellett reorganized the official British Admiralty charts in 1847. Wilkes' name MacDonough was changed to Camano to honor the Spanish explorer Jacinto Caama√±o. Wilkes' name Saratoga Passage was retained. George Vancouver had previously, in 1792, named Saratoga Passage \\"Port Gardner\\", in honor of Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner. Today the name Port Gardner survives as the bay and harbor of Everett.

He was succeeded in 1884 by Robert J. Lowry; and in 1885 Livingston Mims began the longest term as president, serving, with a two-year interruption, from 1886 through 1906. Subsequent presidents have all served two years or less. The first club house was located at 43 Walton Street. In August 1884, the club moved to a new establishment at 114 Peachtree Street. The Club presently operates three facilities for the use of its members, the oldest of which, the downtown Atlanta club building on John Portman Blvd., was dedicated on December 16, 1911. Herbert Barker was the original architect of the golf course, which was completed in 1911. The Capital City Country Club, located in Brookhaven, was leased in 1913 and purchased in 1915. At that time the golf course was increased from nine to eighteen holes. The present country club building was erected in 1928.

First published in serialized installments in L'√âcho de Paris between September 1892 and May 1893, Dans le ciel, assembled and edited by Pierre Michel and Jean-Fran√ßois Nivet, first appeared its present form in 1989. English translation : In the Sky, Nine- Banded Books, Charleston, 2015. Translation : Ann Sterzinger. Introduction : Claire Nettleton.In the Sky, Nine-Banded Books, 2015. Plot summary Inspired by the art of the Impressionists ‚Äì using Claude Monet and, mainly, Vincent van Gogh as models for its central characters ‚Äì, Dans le ciel conveys the author's growing conviction that the only worthwhile art communicated its striving for the incommunicable and that the finished work could express no more than the frustration of its goals. Vincent van Gogh, The Starry Night, 1889 (Museum of Modern Art, New York) A series of interlocking narratives, the novel begins by relating the creative failures of the self-styled novelist Georges, who produces nothing but an unfinished autobiography, then chronicles the poignant struggles of the painter Lucien, whose inability to complete his masterpiece culminates with his suicide when he severs his own hand. It is with the discovery of the terrible fate of the self-mutilating artist that Mirbeau's truncated narrative is itself left in suspension. Commentary In the novel's disjointed, fragmentary structure, Mirbeau expresses his rejection of the artificial unity of conventional novelistic form. As referred to in the title, it is in the sky that the artist locates the uncapturable ideal and on the terrestrial plane that the story of his creative tragedy plays out. Octave Mirbeau‚Äôs text focuses on the unbridgeable distance between the inspiration orienting the artist upward and the heavy, gravity-bound smallness of his limited ability. Since the artist can never express with the ¬´ clumsy, faithless tools of his head and hands ¬ª Pierre Michel and Jean-Fran√ßois Nivet, Octave Mirbeau, l'impr√©cateur au c≈ìur fid√®le, Librairie S√©guier, 1990, p. 478.(Michel and Nivet), the perfect beauty he intuits, his art becomes an experience of suffering. The existential struggle of the artist, like Lucien, whose labor is foreordained to come to nothing, suggests that the creator maintains his dignity through a refusal to surrender and that he attains nobility in the rejection of compromise and the determination to persevere.  Characters = Lucien  Lucien is one of the central fictional characters in the novel. He is the friend of the embedded narrator, Georges, to whom he has bequeathed his house, situated on a fantastic mountain peak that rises vertiginously into the sky. Lucien is modeled on Vincent van Gogh, whose paintings The Irises and The Sunflowers Mirbeau himself had purchased, and whose masterpiece The Starry Night is attributed to Lucien. However, while considering the Dutch artist to be entirely sane, Mirbeau portrays Lucien as becoming gradually unhinged. Still, Lucien is meant to be taken as an entirely imaginary character, in no way a faithful rendering of his real-life counterpart. Like Clara in Le Jardin des supplices (The Torture Garden) and C√©lestine in Le Journal d‚Äôune femme de chambre (The Diary of a Chambermaid), Lucien is given no last name. The son of a butcher, Lucien had had the good fortune to emerge ¬´ sound in mind and body from the stupefying regimen of secondary school ¬ª, and thereafter, against the wishes of his father, had elected to become a painter ‚Äì in the same way that l‚ÄôAbb√© Jules, from the novel of the same name, had chosen to become a priest, ¬´ By God! ¬ª Lucien‚Äôs artistic credo can be reduced to the formula he never tires of repeating: ¬´ See, feel, understand. ¬ª But Lucien‚Äôs conception of art remains confused, as he moves back and forth between Impressionism, Divisionism, and Expressionism. Never able to express his ideal of art in words, he aims too high, and the works he completes are always tragically inferior to those that he imagines, the works that his refractory hand is incapable of executing : ¬´ The deeper that I penetrate into the inexpressible and supernatural mystery of nature, the weaker and more impotent I feel in the face of such beauty. Perhaps one can conceive of nature vaguely in one's mind, but rendering that conception by using the crude, awkward, and untrustworthy instrument of the hand ‚Äì that, I believe, is beyond one's human capabilities. ¬ª Thus, in the course of his development as a character ‚Äì having forgotten his original convictions and lost himself in the aesthetic of the Symbolists and Pre-Raphaelites, whom Octave Mirbeau had earlier skewered in his Combats esth√©tiques ‚Äì Lucien ends by committing suicide after cutting off his ‚Äúguilty‚Äù hand. In creating a character who constantly challenges himself, who constantly aspires to an absolute that is impossible and unattainable, Mirbeau explores the tragedy of an artist who is uncompromising, unwilling to conform to the academic traditions of art, and who, rather than submitting to them, confronts head-on the institutionalized prejudices encountered in the world of politics, the fine arts, and a public inhospitable to change.

The piece is in one movement, lasting about 9 minutes. It is dedicated to the memory of Claude Debussy, who died in 1918, and was premiered in London on June 10, 1921, conducted by Serge Koussevitzky. A piano reduction by Arthur Louri√© was published in 1926 , a full score appearing only after Stravinsky re-orchestrated the work in 1947 . Instrumentation The Symphonies was originally scored for an ensemble of 24 wind instruments: 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), alto flute, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, alto clarinet in F, 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, and tuba. The 1947 revision requires 23 players: 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 3 clarinets, 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, and tuba. Analysis In the title of this piece, Stravinsky used the word \\"symphonies\\" (note the plural form) not to label the work as an essay in the symphonic form, but rather in the word's older, broader connotation, from the Greek, of \\"sounding together\\" . The music of the Symphonies draws on Russian folk elements, and is constructed of \\"contrasting episodes at three different yet related tempos\\" . The chorale which concludes the piece was originally published in the magazine La Revue musicale in an edition entitled Le Tombeau de Claude Debussy, which included short pieces from several composers, including Maurice Ravel and Manuel de Falla, dedicated to Debussy's memory . It appeared as a piano score in the Tombeau. Reception The premiere at Queen's Hall, London, was greeted initially by laughter and derision from an audience unaccustomed to Stravinsky's experimental work. According to Arthur Rubinstein, who attended the performance with Stravinsky, laughter broke out during the bassoon segment, and the conductor, Koussevitzky, \\"instead of stopping the performance and addressing the audience with a few words, assuring them that it was a serious work in the modern idiom, smiled maliciously and even had a twinkle in his eye as he looked over his shoulder at the laughing audience\\" . A reviewer for the Times reported, however, that the hisses \\"were no sign of ill-will towards the composer\\", and subsided when Stravinsky stood up at the end of the performance to bow .

Gilbert envisioned the set as resembling John Martin's 1853 painting The Plains of Heaven: vaporous mountains and headlands around ethereal blue and a flowering slope on which sit white-clad angels. Gilbert also specified that the women characters 'in costume & general appearance ‚Äì should suggest the idea rather of angels than of conventional fairies, and they exhibit an 'overweening sense of righteousness,' arising from their freedom from sin.Stedman Background W.S. Gilbert in about 1870 W. S. Gilbert created several blank verse \\"fairy comedies\\" at the Haymarket Theatre for John Baldwin Buckstone and starring William Hunter Kendal and his wife Madge Robertson Kendal (sister of the playwright Tom Robertson), in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planch√©, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907‚Äì21). Volume XIII. \\"The Victorian Age\\", Part One. VIII. Nineteenth-Century Drama, ¬ß 15. W. S. Gilbert. The first was The Palace of Truth in 1870, a fantasy adapted from a story by Madame de Genlis. Second was Pygmalion and Galatea (1871), a satire of sentimental, romantic attitudes toward myth, and The Wicked World was third. These plays, together with Sweethearts (1874), Charity, and Broken Hearts (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed Entertainments had done for him on the musical stage. They established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque and won him artistic credentials as a writer of wide range, who was as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour. Although these fairy comedies represented a step forward for Gilbert, the blank verse is a drawback, as it limits Gilbert's vital prose style. The plot of The Wicked World clearly fascinated Gilbert. Not only did he write a short story on the theme in 1871, but he also co-wrote a parody of it, The Happy Land (1873), and he returned to it in his 1909 comic opera, Fallen Fairies. Gilbert sued The Pall Mall Gazette, which had called The Wicked World indecent because of the references to \\"mortal love\\" in the script. Gilbert lost the case, but he had the satisfaction of having his play found inoffensive in a court of law. Like a number of Gilbert's blank-verse plays, The Wicked World treats the subject of the consequences that ensue when an all-female world is disrupted by men, and the romantic complications they bring. His plays The Princess (1870) and Broken Hearts (1875), and his operas Iolanthe (1882) and Princess Ida (1884), are all treatments of this basic idea.Introduction to Broken Hearts, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2009 Stedman calls this a \\"Gilbertian invasion plot\\".Stedman (p. 95): In \\"a Gilbertian invasion\\" plot, outsiders change a tranquil society, as where the Thespians take control of Olympus in Thespis, and the Flowers of Progress remodel Utopia in Utopia, Limited. Another of Gilbert's recurring themes that is present in this play, as well as in Broken Hearts, The Yeomen of the Guard, and other Gilbert works, is his distrust of heroic men.

Act I From \\"Fairy Land\\", on the upper side of a cloud, the mortal world below is visible. Two female fairies, noble, sinless beings, are curious about the nature of the \\"wicked world\\". Selene, the Fairy Queen, appears and explains that every fairy has an exact physical counterpart in the mortal world. A male fairy, Lutin, returns from a journey to the earth and sends the male fairies Ethais and Phyllon to visit the Fairy King in \\"mid-earth\\". They are to return to Fairyland with \\"some priceless privilege\\" for the fairies. After the two fairies leave, the others decide to bring up to Fairyland the mortal counterparts of Ethais and Phyllon, as a law of Fairyland allows them to do. They hope to convert these mortals to the virtuous life by the power of their example. They are also curious about \\"the gift of Love\\", which, Selene tells them, is the one compensation mortals have been given for all the evils they must endure on earth. Selene magically summons the mortals to Fairyland. These counterparts are \\"barbaric knights\\", engaged in fighting a duel with each other at the moment that they are transported into the clouds, and Sir Ethais is wounded. They call off the fight for the moment, realising that they are surrounded by beautiful women. The women are impressed by these men: Selene exclaims, \\"what can gods be like if these are men?\\" A fairy, Darine, and Selene are both attracted to Sir Ethais. Lutin re-enters, and Sir Ethais mistakes him for his servant Lutin, the mortal counterpart. Lutin, seeing that \\"mortal love\\" has struck the fairies, is disgusted, and explains that \\"love is but the seed;/The branching tree that springs from it is Hate!\\". Feeling out of place, Lutin angrily goes to join the other two male fairies in mid-earth. Selene kneels at the feet of Sir Ethais, declaring that she loves him. Act II Darine and other fairies are waiting by the entrance to Selene's \\"bower\\", where Selene has been nursing the wounded Sir Ethais for six hours. The fairies complain to each other about Selene's conduct: \\"Surely this knight might well have learnt on earth/Such moral truths as she is teaching him.\\" When Selene appears, the others treat her with ironic politeness and leave. Sir Ethais is better now and has declared his love for her. She is naively romantic, while he is a gallant, smooth-talking cad. She gives him a ring as a pledge of love, and they return into her bower. Darine is still in love with Sir Ethais, and she is intensely jealous. Sir Phyllon tells her that she can win Sir Ethais's love by healing him with a \\"panacea that will heal all wounds\\", which is in the possession of Ethais's servant Lutin, a comic character. Darine persuades Selene to summon the mortal Lutin to Fairyland. The servant, finding himself surrounded by beautiful women, concludes: \\"By some mistake my soul has missed its way,/And slipped into Mahomet's Paradise!\\" So starved are the fairies of \\"mortal love\\" that even he earns their affection. The mortal Lutin is married to the mortal counterpart of Darine. When the fairy Darine enters, he naturally assumes that, unfortunately, his wife has also been transported to this paradise. Darine asks him for the panacea to heal Sir Ethais, disclosing that she loves Ethais, and Lutin is outraged. Why should he assist his wife's love affairs? He gives her a sleeping potion, telling her that it is the panacea. Darine tells Sir Ethais that Sir Phyllon claims he is a coward and is exaggerating the seriousness of his wound. Sir Ethais, enraged, wants to resume the fight, but he is prevented by his wound. Darine says she has Lutin's panacea, and gives it to him in exchange for a pledge of his love for her ‚Äì the ring that Selene gave him. Selene enters, and Darine berates her for introducing mortal love to Fairyland. Selene, seeing the justice of this, resigns as Fairy Queen, and the coronet is placed on Darine's head. Darine also shows her the ring that Sir Ethais has given her. Selene is shocked and disillusioned, becoming bitterly angry with Sir Ethais, Darine, and her fellow-fairies. She cries: \\"Are ye not content?/Behold! I am a devil, like yourselves!\\" Act III The sleeping potion has worked on Sir Ethais, and he cannot be awoken. The mortal Lutin is told that Darine is not his wife, but merely her fairy counterpart. Relieved, he gives her the real panacea, which she immediately gives to Sir Ethais. He revives and attacks Sir Phyllon, who he believes called him a coward. Phyllon denies it, and Darine admits that she lied to gain Ethais's love. Both men are disgusted by this. Sir Ethais apologises to Selene for betraying her love, but he is appalled by the bitter intensity of her feelings, which is the result of a mortal passion being put into an immortal body. The three male fairies are returning, and their mortal counterparts must leave. Selene tries to hold Ethais back, because her love for him, though embittered, still burns. Saying, \\"I go to that good world/Where women are not devils till they die!\\", he shakes her off and leaps off the cloud and back to earth. Final Scene As the mortals disappear, the fairies seem to be awakening from a dream. They regain their true, virtuous selves and are ashamed of their former conduct. Darine and Selene are reconciled, and Selene says that they have no right to feel superior to mortals who fall from virtue more readily because they have been more often tempted. The fairies Lutin, Ethais and Phyllon have brought great news. Their king has decided to bestow on the fairies the gift of mortal love! Selene's final speech, rejecting this gift, prefers the fairies' life of placid tranquillity to the interesting but tempestuous life the mortals enjoy. \\"No, Ethais ‚Äì we will not have this love!\\" NotesReferences * * *Crowther, Andrew.

Her most notable project is the revitalization of Central Park in New York City. After serving as Central Park administrator, Rogers became the first president of the Central Park Conservancy, a private not-for-profit corporation that she helped found in 1980 to bring citizen support to the restoration and renewed management of Central Park. Early life Rogers was born in San Antonio, Texas to C. L. and Elizabeth Browning. She grew up with two brothers in Alamo Heights. A graduate of Wellesley College, where she majored in art history, she later received a Masters in city planning from Yale University. She moved permanently to New York in 1964. Career In 1979, Rogers was appointed the first administrator for Central Park by then-Mayor Ed Koch. At the time, the public space was strewn with trash and long neglected with virtually no funding allocated to improving its condition. Working with then NYC Parks commissioner Gordon J. Davis, Rogers conceived of a master plan to reinstate the Greensward Plan design by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, while also keeping in mind the public purpose of the greensward and practical considerations. Rogers' aim was \\"the renewal of the physical beauty of the park as originally envisioned by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, yet integrated with contemporary social and recreational uses.\\" Rogers recruited friends and volunteers to assist her in reclaiming discrete sections of the park. One of these colleagues was Lynden Miller. In 1982, Rogers asked Miller to tackle Central Park's Conservatory Garden. She founded a program in Garden History and Landscape Studies at the Bard Graduate Center, New York, in 2001, and directed it until 2005. Barlow Rogers is the president of the Foundation for Landscape Studies. Awards Her alma mater honored her with an Alumni Achievement Award in 1989. In 2005, the American Society of Landscape Architects presented her with its LaGasse Medal for her achievements. A discreet bronze plaque on a boulder on the slope above the Diana Ross Playground honors her service to Central Park. Personal life Rogers' first marriage ended in divorce. She has two children.

It was one of the few Harmonium poems first published in that volume,Buttel, p. 160 so it is still under copyright. However, it is quoted here as justified by Fair use to facilitate scholarly commentary. Interpretation The poem marks Stevens's realization that the life of the imagination is more complex and fraught with peril than he had once supposed. Robert Buttel is impressed by an \\"eerie collocation of colors\\" which contributes to the \\"disturbing effect of the invasion of the world of moonlight and dream by Berserk, who personifies the violence of day.\\" Vendler understands the poem as Stevens meeting his own potential madness. The prince of peacocks, the poet, meets Berserk, who will not be evaded even in dreams. She thinks that the initial promise of the poem, the brutal encounter between the prince and Berserk, is dissipated in the final stanza, \\"an unrewarding ending\\".Vendler, p. 16 It may be that Vendler understands the dread in the penultimate stanza to take as its object only the bushy plain. The scope of the dread is narrow. But if the scope is broad, encompassing the final stanza, then the prince knows the dread of the beauty of the moonlight. The eeriness that Buttel mentioned continues to the end of the poem. There isn't a retreat from brutality to incantation, as Vendler sees it, but rather the brutality of the blocks and blocking steel extends into the final stanza. Compare \\"The Public Square\\" for the shared architectural motif.  Notes  References  * Buttel, Robert. Wallace Stevens: The Making of Harmonium. 1967: Princeton University Press. * Vendler, Helen.

Early life Goe was born in Louth, Lincolnshire, England, the only son of Field Flowers Goe, a solicitor, and his wife Mary Jane. Goe was educated at the King Edward's Grammar School, Louth and later at Hertford College, Oxford where he graduated B.A. in 1857 and M.A. in 1860. Career Goe was ordained deacon and priest in 1858 by Archbishop Thomas Musgrave of York. Later that year Goe was appointed curate at Kingston upon Hull. He was rector of Sunderland from 1873 to 1877 and St George's, Bloomsbury, London, from 1877 to 1887. Goe had shown ability as a parish worker, preacher and organiser and in 1886 he was appointed the Bishop of Melbourne in succession to James Moorhouse. Though strongly Evangelical he was not bigoted and had signed the memorial protesting against the persecution of the ritualists. He was installed at the cathedral church of St James, Melbourne, on 14 April 1887. Goe was aware of many problems in his church which needed attention but resolved that until the cathedral could be finished and paid for these must stand aside. St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne was completed, except for its spires, and consecrated on 22 January 1891. By that time the land boom had burst and for the next ten years Melbourne suffered from a severe depression. The financial question caused so many difficulties that it was almost impossible to do more than mark time. The forming of new dioceses had several times been discussed and, on 3 October 1901, an act was passed in the church assembly which gave to the state of Victoria three additional dioceses; Bendigo, Wangaratta and Gippsland. Late life and legacy In 1861 he married Emma, the daughter of William Hurst; they had no children. Goe's wife died on 24 July 1901 and he resigned on 1 November 1901 but acted as administrator until his departure for England on 7 April 1902. He lived in retirement at Wimbledon, near London, until his death on 25 June 1910. Goe was a large man, and regarded as kind. He was neither a great scholar nor a great thinker, but he was a man of shrewd sense who preached peace on earth and goodwill to all men and kept his diocese going through a difficult period.

It is a five piece band, with Manuel B√ºrkli performing the vocals and guitar, Jan Krattiger on guitar, Jenny Jans on piano, Samuel Burri on bass, and Lorenz Hunziker on drums. History Ma√±ana was founded by Manuel B√ºrkli and Jan Krattiger (an acoustic duo) when they were joined by bassist Samuel Burri, pianist Stephan Bader and drummer Lorenz Hunziker. They started performing in venues around Basel in 2003. They were subsequently signed by the label Inside Agency, and soon begun recording some of their songs. They then started opening for bands including I Am Kloot, Keane, Mew and A-ha. Ma√±ana's first record, Fast Days EP, was released in December 2003 throughout Switzerland. It contained five tracks which the band had recently recorded. The band was then able to gain worldwide exposure with their signature track, \\"Miss Evening\\", being featured on the soundtrack of FIFA 2005. The song, which had been getting frequent airplay in Switzerland and around Europe, was heard by hundreds of thousands of people, who would form the basis of their wide and dedicated fan base. In late 2004, \\"Miss Evening\\" was released around Switzerland as Ma√±ana's first single. But to combat the increasing global demands for their music, their Fast Days EP and \\"Miss Evening\\" singles were soon released for legal download on iTunes, Sony Connect and Amazon. The CD version of the EP was a hot seller at the Virgin Megastore in New York's Times Square, where staff made a Ma√±ana shelf display. Feeling that their popularity had grown enough, Ma√±ana embarked on their first ever tour, of Northern Europe in Autumn 2005. This included nine shows in Germany, Austria, The Netherlands and Sweden. They finished the tour with five shows in England, including Liverpool's Cavern Club and headlined the Dublin Castle in London's hipster paradise of Camden Town. A new album has been in planning since early-2005 under the guidance of Swiss label Coffee, and in August 2007 it was announced that they would begin recording their album, in both Basel and Hamburg. Demos of their new songs Time/Gently and Some Kid have been played on Ma√±ana's MySpace page, however. In recent times, Ma√±ana has been performing in numerous festivals and events around Switzerland. Ma√±ana released their debut full album (Interruptions) in August 2008. Under unknown circumstances, Stephan Bader left the band sometime after the release of Fast days. Jenny Jans currently fills his role.  Musical style and influences  Ma√±ana play an essential alternative rock, with heavy influences from indie pop and indie rock. They are influenced by British bands Doves, U2 and The Verve. In more recent times they have looked up to their fellow Swiss band Lovebugs. The band says it is their goal to create \\"their own style\\". Despite being from Switzerland, almost all of Ma√±ana's lyrics are in English.

The velvet provides an especially dark background against which colors stand out. Velvet painting is an ancient technique, and took on a new popularity in the United States in the late 20th century.Nina C. Ayoub (March 6, 2011) \\"Tacky or Terrific? The Art of Experience\\", Chronicle of Higher Education,  Early history  Black velvet paintings originated in Kashmir, the homeland of the fabric. These original paintings were generally religious and portrayed the icons of the Caucasus region which were painted by Russian Orthodox priests. Marco Polo and others introduced black velvet paintings to Western Europe, and some of these early works still hang in the Vatican Museums.  Modern history  The paintings are widely sold in rural America, and frequently have kitsch themes. They often depict images of Elvis Presley (see Velvet Elvis), Dale Earnhardt, John Wayne, Jesus, Native Americans, dogs playing poker, wolves, and cowboys, and the colors are often bright and vivid to contrast the dark velvet. They can also include more exotic or avant-garde themes. Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico was a center of velvet painting in the 1970s. A displaced Georgia farmboy, Doyle Harden, was the pioneer who created an enormous factory, where velvets were turned out by the thousands by artists sitting in studios. One artist would paint one piece of the picture, then slide the velvet along to the next artist, who would add something else. Velvet paintings mass-produced by hand in this manner fueled the boom in velvet paintings in the 1970s in the United States. Edgar Leeteg has been called \\"the father of American black velvet kitsch\\". In Portland, Oregon, a museum devoted solely to velvet paintings, the Velveteria, operated from late 2005 to January 2010. It reopened in December 2013 in the Chinatown neighborhood of Los Angeles, Calif.  See also  *Birodo yuzen  References  Further reading  *Eric A.

Havr√°nok is an important archaeological site in northern Slovakia. It is on a hill above the Liptovsk√° Mara water reservoir around from the village of Bobrovn√≠k, about halfway between Ru≈æomberok and Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° in the Liptov region. The archaeologists unearthed a prehistoric Celtic hill fort and a medieval wooden castle in the 1960s, during the construction of the Liptovsk√° Mara dam. Both objects have been partially reconstructed. During the Iron Age and the Roman Era, the shrine of Havr√°nok was an important religious center of the Celts living in Slovakia. History The Havr√°nok hill fort was an important religious, economic, and political center of the P√∫chov culture (300 BCE - 180 CE), in which the dominant Celtic tribe of Cotini mingled with the older people of the Lusatian culture. The prosperous oppidum was destroyed along with other Celtic settlements in Slovakia around the beginning of the Common Era either by the Germanic tribe of Quadi or by Dacians. A medieval wooden castle existed near the remnants of the ancient hill fort from the 11th to 15th century CE. Celtic shrine The hill fort was a religious center of the Celts living in northern Slovakia. Its wooden shrine was built in the 1st century BCE around an exceptionally high wooden column, probably a totem or a statue. http://havranok.host.sk/ Excavation of a ritual pit situated near this central cult object revealed bones of at least seven people sacrificed during druidic rituals.Stopy Keltov ved√∫ na liptovsk√Ω Havr√°nok - cestovanie.SME.sk The victims were beaten to death, quartered, and in some cases also burnt. Parts of their bodies were subsequently thrown into the pit. A large number of agricultural tools in the vicinity of the pit indicate that human sacrifices may have served to insure a good harvest. The shrine also included a number of smaller wooden columns, with burnt offerings (mostly jewels, agricultural products, and animals) buried next to them. Other buildings In addition to the shrine, the reconstructed buildings include a fortified gateway of the hill fort with a part of the stone walls (120-50 BCE), farmstead (300-100 BCE), a pottery kiln (300-100 BCE), and huts from various periods. In the Iron Age and the Roman Era, Havr√°nok was surrounded by several Celtic villages. Some of them were inundated by Liptovsk√° Mara reservoir. The small medieval castle is also partially reconstructed and the whole area of Havr√°nok is now an open-air museum. The site was proclaimed the national cultural monument in 1967.

The Las Vegas Club opened in 1930, joining the Las Vegas Hotel which had opened in 1908. The Las Vegas Club was relocated across the street in 1949. At its new location, the Las Vegas Club operated within the Overland Hotel, which was established in 1905. Jackie Gaughan and Mel Exber purchased the Las Vegas Club in 1962, and added a sports theme. Hotel towers were added in 1980 and 1996; the latter tower was part of a $35 million expansion. Exber died in 2002, and Gaughan sold the Las Vegas Club to Barrick Gaming in 2004. Barrick's partner, Tamares Group, bought out Barrick's ownership stake in 2005. The hotel portion, with 410 rooms, was closed in April 2013. Tamares sold the Las Vegas Club two years later to Derek and Greg Stevens, who owned two other downtown casinos. The Stevens closed the Las Vegas Club casino on August 20, 2015, with plans to redevelop the resort through renovations and some demolition. It was later decided that the buildings would be demolished entirely for a new resort. Demolition began in 2017, and the Circa Resort & Casino is scheduled to open on the property in October 2020. History=Overland Hotel The eventual site of the Las Vegas Club, at the corner of Main Street and Fremont Street, was initially occupied by the Overland Hotel. John Wisner bought the property at a 1905 land auction for $1,750. He opened the Overland Hotel later that year. In 1906, Wisner announced plans to build a two-story addition, with the existing hotel building being renovated to form a wing of the new hotel. The addition was built south of the original structure. Construction of the new building was underway in 1907, and it opened that December. The hotel included gambling and a bar. In early 1911, the ground floor was divided into three business spaces, including one for a restaurant. The hotel burned down in a fire on the night of May 23, 1911. One person was killed and several were injured after jumping from a second-floor balcony. The fire originated in the hotel's restaurant. Wisner had plans to rebuild the hotel as a two-story building made of reinforced concrete. The new Overland opened in November 1911, with the same amenities as before. A veranda was soon added to the building, giving it the same appearance as its predecessor. A complete remodeling of the hotel began in 1918. Twelve new hotel rooms were constructed along Main Street in 1921, and the hotel was modernized. Wisner died a year later, at the age of 66. His estate went to his daughter, Ethel Wisner Genther. The Genthers carried out further improvements to the hotel in 1924, including renovations to the entire top floor. The Overland included a showroom for salespeople to demonstrate their products. Original Las Vegas Club The Las Vegas Club originally operated on the south side of Fremont Street, at 21-23 Fremont Street, midway between Main and 1st Street. John Horden and Harry Beale had initially built the two-story Las Vegas Hotel (also called the Hotel Las Vegas) in 1908. It operated at 19 Fremont Street, next to the Northern Club casino. An addition was completed in 1911, adding a barbershop, a billiard hall, and card games. The Las Vegas Hotel also included a bar, which was later removed and replaced by a shop in the late 1920s. The Las Vegas Club opened in late 1930, diagonally across the street from the Overland Hotel. J. Kell Houssels owned the Las Vegas Club with Horden and A. F. Gilmore, who had spent approximately $1,400 on building improvements prior to the opening. Before Houssel's involvement, the casino had been operating as the Smoke House, owned by Gilmore and located at 23 Fremont Street. The Smoke House had offered card games and pool. Horden died in 1941. Benny Binion came to Las Vegas in the mid-1940s and became a partner in the Las Vegas Club. In 1948, Houssels was issued a gaming license to operate the casino, although nine associates ‚Äì including Binion ‚Äì were denied licensing. Binion then ended his partnership with Houssels and the casino. In 1949, Houssels was unable to work out a new lease deal with Horden's wife. The Las Vegas Club closed that year, when Houssels relocated it across the street to the Overland Hotel at 18 Fremont Street. Meanwhile, the original Las Vegas Club later operated as The Westerner casino during the 1950s, and then as the Club Bingo until 1983, when it became part of the Pioneer Club. New location Las Vegas Club facade At its new location, the Las Vegas Club occupied the bottom floor of the Overland Hotel, while the latter continued operations under its own name for some time. In 1957, Houssels sought state approval for a 15-percent interest in the Las Vegas Club. W. W. Naylor also sought a 12-percent interest. Naylor was the founder of a restaurant chain called Biff's, named after his son. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Las Vegas Club included a Biff's restaurant. The Las Vegas Club closed in mid-1959. A year and a half later, a group had plans to lease the casino from Houssels and its three other owners: Joe and Vic Hall, and Bernard Vandersteen. The leasing group consisted of gaming executives Jackie Gaughan, Mel Exber and Larry Hezzelwood. In May 1962, Gaughan, Exber and Hezzelwood purchased the Las Vegas Club and Overland Hotel from Houssels. The group also purchased adjoining businesses such as the Chatterbox Bar, which operated inside the Overland. The total sale price was $1 million. Hezzelwood, at the age of 63, died of an apparent heart attack in December 1962. Mel Exber served as the president of the Las Vegas Club, and his brother and son would also work there as executives. The Overland Hotel remained operational during the mid-1960s. Exber was a fan of sports, especially baseball. A sports theme was added to the Las Vegas Club, and was in place by 1970. Two restaurants were named after baseball concepts, including the Bullpen and the Dugout. The latter restaurant replaced Biff's. The Las Vegas Club also featured the Sports Hall of Fame, an assortment of sports memorabilia from Exber's own collection. The collection included rare photographs, autographed items, and World Series baseball bats from 1946 to 1958. Much of the memorabilia was devoted to the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. In addition, the casino issued limited-edition casino chips featuring notable sports players such as Babe Ruth. A Hickok Belt, won by Maury Wills in 1962, was loaned to Exber in 1971 for display in the Las Vegas Club. It was stolen from the casino 10 years later. In 1975, Gaughan and Exber announced plans for a $4 million expansion, including a 208-room tower to be built behind the Las Vegas Club. The renovation project would also update the exterior to resemble a sports stadium. The Las Vegas Club's facade was inspired by Ebbets Field, where Exber's favorite team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, used to play. The facade included a brass statue of a baseball player, surrounded by a wall of mirrored panels. By 1977, the \\"Overland\\" name was no longer in use. Gaughan and Exber ultimately added two hotel towers, the first of which was finished in 1980. Visiting baseball teams would play at nearby Cashman Field and would frequently stay at the Las Vegas Club. =Later years= In the 1990s, the Las Vegas Club's sports book struggled to compete against those located in newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Most of the sports book's customers were locals, and it had difficulty attracting tourists. The second hotel tower, standing 16 stories high, was topped off in early 1996. The Las Vegas Club ultimately occupied two acres. A $35 million expansion was opened in October 1996, and was expected to be fully finished a month later. It included an casino area designed to resemble a baseball stadium, with murals depicting fans. The casino had a total of , with 400 new slot machines added, bringing the total number to 850. It also had six blackjack tables, offering the most liberal rules in the world. The original casino facility and the sports book also underwent a renovation. The expansion included the 16-story tower, for a total of 415 rooms. The Dugout coffee shop was expanded and two new restaurants were added, including The Upper Deck, featuring four rooms each themed around a different sport. The expansion was partially influenced by the success of the Fremont Street Experience, located in front of the Las Vegas Club. Exber said that when the expansion was finished, \\"We will have built a haven for sports fans.\\" The expansion proved to be popular among such fans. In the late 1990s, Gaughan sought a buyer for the Las Vegas Club, with a selling price of $45 million. Mel Exber died in May 2002, from complications following a stroke. At the end of the year, Gaughan agreed to sell the Las Vegas Club and three other downtown casinos ‚Äì including the Plaza ‚Äì to Barrick Gaming. Barrick was in partnership with the Tamares Group. The $82 million sale of the four casinos was finalized in March 2004. In June 2005, Tamares bought out Barrick's 23-percent ownership in the four downtown casinos, including the Las Vegas Club. At the end of the year, Tamares chose Navegante Group to operate the casinos. Navegante did so through an entity known as PlayLV. The casino's sports book was subsequently closed. A new poker room opened in January 2007. Two months later, Tamares announced that it was considering converting the property into a high-rise condo-hotel. This ultimately did not happen. In May 2007, Navegante announced that it would end its relationship with Tamares within a year, stating that the latter company would be better off finding an operator that could also invest in its properties. At the time, the Las Vegas Club had 780 slot machines and 18 table games. Although Navegante departed, PlayLV continued its role as casino operator. Tinoco's Kitchen, a 120-seat Italian restaurant, opened in early 2009. The casino's gourmet restaurant, Great Moments, closed that year. During 2011, the Las Vegas Club offered the only bingo in downtown Las Vegas. The game was played in a temporary room, as Tamares planned to relocate its bingo operations to the Plaza following renovations there. The Las Vegas Club lacked a pool, although hotel guests had access to the one at the Plaza. In January 2012, the hotel began limiting its reservations to weekends only. Tamares was considering various possibilities for the Las Vegas Club, although any work on the resort would not take place until the full completion of renovations at the Plaza. Tinoco's Kitchen closed in May 2012, leaving the resort without a major dining option. Later that year, magician The Amazing Johnathan opened SCREAMont Experiment, a Halloween attraction at the Las Vegas Club. It consisted of a haunted house maze. In February 2013, The Amazing Johnathan announced that he was hired to give the Las Vegas Club a complete redesign, although these plans never materialized. In April 2013, Tamares announced that it would close the Las Vegas Club's hotel at the end of the month. Tamares subsequently redirected prospective hotel guests to the Plaza. The Las Vegas Club had 410 hotel rooms, which never reopened. The casino continued to operate, and renovations were underway at the time of the hotel closing. The Las Vegas Club struggled financially and offered few amenities following the closure of the hotel. A bar offered hot dogs, but casino patrons were otherwise directed to the Plaza for food as well as entertainment. =Closure and demolition= In May 2014, Tamares announced its hopes to add a CVS pharmacy to the Las Vegas Club. Plans for a pharmacy proceeded in May 2015. The pharmacy would be located on the Las Vegas Club's east side and would sell alcohol. It would take over the casino's corner entrance, reduce gaming space, and replace a bar.Martin, Bradley (8 May 2015). \\"Fremont Street's Las Vegas Club to be Chopped in Two\\". Las Vegas Eater. Retrieved 7 July 2015. At the time, the casino measured and had 327 slot machines. Other downtown casino owners were opposed to the pharmacy. The Fremont Street Experience had placed limits on alcohol consumption and sales in 2014, although pharmacies were exempt. The opposing casino owners stated that the new rules had reduced the number of emergency calls and \\"chronic inebriates\\" in the area, while stating that a pharmacy would bring back problems such as crime and medical emergencies. On August 14, 2015, it was announced that the Las Vegas Club had been sold to brothers Derek and Greg Stevens, who also owned the Golden Gate and The D casinos in downtown Las Vegas. The Stevens were among opponents of the pharmacy, which was part of a larger vision that Tamares had for redeveloping the Las Vegas Club. However, the company wanted to focus more on its Plaza resort, and the opposition to the pharmacy was a contributing factor in the sale. The Stevens had talked with Tamares five years earlier about purchasing the Las Vegas Club, although the discussions eventually ended, before resuming again in July 2015 amid the pharmacy opposition. The sale did not include the \\"Las Vegas Club\\" name. A day after the sale was announced, Derek Stevens said that the Las Vegas Club would close in 60 days for renovations and some demolition. However, it was announced later in the day that the casino would be shutting down over the next five days. The casino's 19 table games closed on August 16, 2015, leaving only slot machines and the casino cage open. The remainder of the casino was closed on August 20, 2015, shortly after midnight. The closing received little fanfare. A small group of regular customers visited the casino ahead of its closing. A gift shop remained open through the end of the month. Some employees of the Las Vegas Club were transferred to the Plaza. The sports memorabilia was soon sold off to the public. After the closure, Derek Stevens planned to evaluate the building over the next few months to determine how to use the property. He initially expected redevelopment to consist of renovations combined with demolition and new construction. However, he disliked the building's design and eventually decided to demolish it entirely, in favor of a new project known as Circa Resort & Casino. In April 2016, the Stevens purchased adjacent businesses ‚Äì such as the Mermaids Casino ‚Äì which would also be demolished for the new resort. The extra property provided new possibilities for a larger version of the Stevens' upcoming resort, and the brothers took additional time to determine specifics about the new project. To retain the property's gaming license, 16 slot machines in the Las Vegas Club were temporarily opened to the public for eight hours on June 27, 2017. Demolition of small buildings, such as Mermaids, was underway in August 2017, before moving on to the Las Vegas Club hotel towers by October. Because of the location, demolition of the towers proceeded one floor at a time for the safety of the public. Demolition continued into early 2018 and was expected to conclude around that time. Circa is scheduled to open in October 2020.

In addition to introducing common programming techniques, it also aims at offering insights in robotics and artificial intelligence. RoboMind is available as stand-alone application for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It was first released in 2005 and was originally developed by Arvid Halma, a student of the University of Amsterdam at the time. Since 2011, RoboMind has been published by Research Kitchen.Research Kitchen, Delft, The Netherlands. The simulation environment The application is built around a two-dimensional grid world in which a robot can move around, observe neighboring cells, or mark them by leaving a paint trail. The world may also contain so-called beacons that can be carried around by the robot in order to clear its way. Since version 4.0, it is possible to export RoboMind scripts to robots in the real world directly. Currently, Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 are supported.RoboMind's Lego Mindstorms NXT support The scripting language RoboMind offers a basic scripting language that consists of a concise set of rules. Apart from commands to make the robot perform basic movement instructions, the control flow can be modified by conditional branching (if-then-else), loops (while) and calls to custom procedures. Example script to draw square: paintWhite repeat(4) { forward(2) right } Recursive line follower example: follow procedure follow{ if(frontIsWhite){ forward(1) } else if(rightIsWhite){ right } else if(leftIsWhite){ left } else{ end } follow } The programming environment offers an integrated text editor to write these scripts, with syntax highlighting, autocompletion and line numbering. Modifications to the environment, such as painting grid cells, are used to store a runtime state. This shows the robot in its environment is directly related to 2D Turing machines.Robomind Turmite: 2D Turing Machine, a YouTube movie.Sorting Turing Machine in RoboMind, a YouTube movie. Since version 5.0, the language does allow the declaration of variables and functions (procedures that return values). The scripting language itself is currently available in 22 languages: Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Ukrainian. All instructions and keywords can be translated. This makes it easier to learn for non-English speakers than most other programming languages that are constrained to English syntax and Latin alphabets. Relation to other educational software RoboMind is somewhat similar to Karel the Robot but its syntax is closer to C/C++ while Karel is closer to Pascal. RoboMind can be related to the Logo, at which a turtle can be moved around to create geometric shapes. The syntax of RoboMind however is different and corresponds more directly to mainstream scripting languages, such as JavaScript. In RoboMind perceiving and changing the environment are of equal importance, where Logo focuses mostly on the latter. This makes RoboMind more suitable to demonstrate real life applications. In Logo, on the other hand, users have more freedom to create visual effects. Other free educational programming languages, such as Alice and Scratch focus on the wider domain of interactive story telling.

At age eight, she played an instrumental role in the Mendez v. Westminster case, the landmark desegregation case of 1946. The case successfully ended de jure segregation in California and paved the way for integration and the American civil rights movement.\\" Mendez grew up during a time when most southern and southwestern schools were segregated. In the case of California, Hispanics were not allowed to attend schools that were designated for \\"Whites\\" only and were sent to the so-called \\"Mexican schools.\\" Mendez was denied enrollment to a \\"Whites\\" only school, an event which prompted her parents to take action and together organized various sectors of the Hispanic community who filed a lawsuit in the local federal court. The success of their action, of which Sylvia was the principal catalyst, would eventually bring to an end the era of segregated education. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honor, on February 15, 2011. Early years Mendez was born in 1936 in Santa Ana, California. Her parents were Gonzalo Mendez, an immigrant from Mexico who had a successful agricultural business, and Felicitas Mendez, a native of Juncos, Puerto Rico. The family had just moved from Santa Ana to Westminster to tend a farm that they were renting from the Munemitsus, a Japanese-American family that had been sent to an internment camp during World War II. This took place during a period in history when racial discrimination against Hispanics, and minorities in general, was widespread throughout the United States. In the 1940s, there were only two schools in Westminster: Hoover Elementary and 17th Street Elementary. Orange County schools were segregated and the Westminster school district was no exception. The district mandated separate campuses for Hispanics and Whites. Sylvia and her two brothers, Gonzalo Jr. and Jerome Mendez, attended Hoover Elementary, a two-room wooden shack in the middle of the city's Mexican neighborhood, along with the other Hispanics. 17th Street Elementary, which was a \\"Whites-only\\" segregated school, was located about a mile away. Unlike Hoover, the 17th Street Elementary school was amongst a row of palm and pine trees and had a lawn lining the school's brick and concrete facade. Realizing that the 17th Street Elementary school provided better books and educational benefits, Gonzalo decided that he would like to have his children and nephews enrolled there. Thus, in 1943, when Sylvia Mendez was only eight years old, she accompanied her aunt Sally Vidaurri, her brothers and cousins to enroll at the 17th Street Elementary School. Her aunt was told by school officials, that her children, who had light skin would be permitted to enroll, but that neither Sylvia Mendez nor her brothers would be allowed because they were dark-skinned and had a Hispanic surname. Mrs. Vidaurri stormed out of the school with her children, niece and nephews and recounted her experience to her brother Gonzalo. Mendez v. Westminster Mendez's father Gonzalo and his wife Felicitas took on the task of leading a community battle that changed California, and set an important legal precedent for ending segregation in the United States. Felicitas attended the family's agricultural business, giving Gonzalo time to meet with community leaders to discuss the injustices of the segregated school system. Initially, Gonzalo received little support from the local Latino organizations, but finally, on March 2, 1945, he and four other Mexican-American fathers from the Gomez, Palomino, Estrada, and Ramirez families filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles against four Orange County school districts -- Westminster, Santa Ana, Garden Grove, and El Modena (now eastern Orange) -- on behalf of about 5,000 Hispanic-American schoolchildren. During the trial, the Westminster school board insisted that there was a \\"language issue\\", however their claim fell apart when one of the children was asked to testify. The testimony proved that most of the children spoke English and showed that Hispanic-American students had the same capacity for learning as their white counterparts. On February 18, 1946, Judge Paul J. McCormick ruled in favor of Mendez and his co-plaintiffs. However, the school district appealed. Several organizations joined the appellate case as amicus curiae, including the ACLU, American Jewish Congress, Japanese American Citizens League, and the NAACP which was represented by Thurgood Marshall. More than a year later, on April 14, 1947, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling in Mendez v. Westminster in favor of the Mexican families. After the ruling was upheld on appeal, then-Governor Earl Warren moved to desegregate all public schools and other public spaces in California. Aftermath On January 19, 1948, Mendez and her siblings were finally allowed to attend the 17th Street Elementary school, thus becoming one of the first Hispanics to attend an all- white school in California. However, the situation was not easy for her. Her white peers called her names and treated her poorly. She knew that she had to succeed after her father fought for her to attend the school. Gonzalo Mendez died in 1964 at the age of 51, unaware of the impact that the case for which he fought would have on the nation. Felicitas Mendez lived another 3 decades and died of heart failure at her daughter's home in April 1998.Los Angeles Times; Felicitas Mendez; Filed Key School Desegregation Suit Mendez v. Westminster set an important precedent for ending segregation in the United States. Thurgood Marshall, who was later appointed a Supreme Court justice in 1967, became the lead NAACP attorney in the 1954 Brown case. His amicus brief filed for Mendez on behalf of the NAACP contained the arguments he would later use in the Brown case. The Mendez case also deeply influenced the thinking of the California governor at the time, Earl Warren. By 1954, when the Brown case appeared before the high court, Warren had become the chief justice. Legacy Mendez became a nurse and retired after working for thirty years in her field. She adopted two girls and lives in Fullerton, California. She travels and gives lectures to educate others on the historic contributions made by her parents and the co-plaintiffs to the desegregation effort in the United States. The success of the Mendez v. Westminster case made California the first state in the nation to end segregation in school, paving the way for better-known Brown vs. Board of Education seven years later, which would bring an end to school segregation in the entire country. Sandra Robbie wrote and produced the documentary Mendez v. Westminster: For all the Children / Para Todos los Ninos, which debuted on KOCE-TV in Orange County on September 24, 2002 as part of their Hispanic Heritage Month celebration. The documentary, which also aired on PBS, won an Emmy award and a Golden Mike Award. A ribbon- cutting ceremony was held in the Los Angeles County Law Library for the opening of a new exhibit in the law library display case titled \\"Mendez to Brown: A Celebration.\\" The exhibit features photos from both the Mendez and Brown cases, in addition to original documents. In 1998, the district of Santa Ana, California honored the Mendez family by naming a new school the \\"Gonzalo and Felicitas Mendez Fundamental Intermediate School\\", after Sylvia Mendez's parents. In 2004, Mendez was invited to the White House for the celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month. She met with President George W. Bush, who shared her story with key Democrats, including U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton of New York. On April 14, 2007, the U.S. Postal Service unveiled a stamp commemorating the Mendez v. Westminster case. The unveiling took take place during an event at Chapman University School of Education, Orange County, California commemorating the 60th anniversary of the landmark case. On September 9, 2009 a second school opened in the Los Angeles community of Boyle Heights bearing the name \\"Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez Learning Center.\\" The dual school campus commemorated the efforts of the Mendez and other families from the Westminster case. An exhibit honoring Mendez v. Westminster was scheduled to open in September 2011, at the Old Courthouse Museum in Santa Ana. This exhibit known as \\"A Class Act\\" is sponsored by the Museum of Teaching and Learning. Sylvia Mendez is a member of the exhibit planning committee along with her brother, Gonzalo. On February 15, 2011, Sylvia Mendez was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2012, Brooklyn College awarded Sylvia Mendez an honorary degree.CUNY On May 23, 2018, the board of Berkeley Unified School District voted unanimously to rename Le Conte Elementary School, located at 2241 Russell Street, as Sylvia Mendez Elementary School. The school is a Spanish-English two-way immersion school. Mendez has been a spokesperson at Berkeley schools and her story has been inspirational to Berkeley students, teachers, and parents.http://www.berkeleyside.com/2018/05/24/leconte-elementary-renamed-for- sylvia-mendez-desegregation-pioneer See also * Lemon Grove Incident *List of notable Puerto Ricans *List of Puerto Rican Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients ReferencesFurther reading * * *David S.

Its area has been entirely absorbed by the growth of London; with its name currently referring to the Brixton district.Mills, A., Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names, (2001) Its area corresponds to London Boroughs: Southwark, Lambeth, Wandsworth and parts of Merton and Richmond upon Thames. History The name is first recorded as Brixiges stan in 1062, meaning stone of a man called Beorhtsige. The stone may have been the location that early hundred meetings took place.Brixges Stane, the Meeting Place of the Brixton Hundred in Surrey, Graham Gower, Local History Publications 1996 Gower suggests that the stone was located at the boundary of Streatham, Clapham and Lambeth parishes. A nearby location on Brixton Hill became the location for the hundred gallows. Brixton Hill had been known as Bristowe Causeway long before the modern Brixton area was developed. The Surrey House of Correction, now known as Brixton Prison, was opened there in 1820. The hundred contained the parishes of Battersea (including the detached part of Penge), Bermondsey (also later Rotherhithe), Camberwell, Hatcham, Lambeth, Walworth, Streatham, Barnes, Merton, Mortlake (also later Wimbledon and Putney), Tooting and Wandsworth.British History Online - The hundred of BrixtonOpen Domesday Online: Brixton Hundred, accessed July 2018.

History Front view of the 1952 Disco Volante Spider, highlighting the lenticular cross-section of the body. The 1900 C52 was originally developed in 1952 to take part to Sport category races. Its fully enveloping aerodynamic bodywork was developed and built together with Carrozzeria Touring, and wind tunnel tested. Studied to achieve a low drag coefficient even in crosswinds, the body featured a lenticular cross-section both viewed from the front and from the side; the underbody was faired-in. According to some the design of the Jaguar E-type has some design cues similar to the Disco Volante. Built around an all-new tubular space frame, the Disco Volante used lightened components from the Alfa Romeo 1900. As on the 1900, the engine was an inline-four with double chain-driven overhead camshafts, but used an aluminium block and inserted sleeves instead of the 1900s cast iron one. While the 1900s 88 mm stroke was retained, cylinder bore had grown from 82.55 mm to 85 mm, bringing total displacement to 1,997.4 cubic centimetres; compression ratio was raised to 8.73:1. So configured, fed by two twin-choke sidedraught carburettors, the engine produced at . The transmission was 4-speed gearbox with synchronised forwards speeds and a multi plate dry clutch. Suspension was, as on other Alfa Romeos of the time, by double wishbones at the front and solid axle linked to the chassis by an upper triangle and two lower longitudinal reaction arms. The brakes were drums on all four corners, and the 6.0√ó16\\" tyres were fitted to wire wheels with duralumin rims. Thanks to its aerodynamic shape the car could attain a top speed of . Three examples of the two-litre Disco Volante were built in total. In 1953 two of them were modified to carry out further aerodynamic tests. One was given a fixed roof, becoming an enclosed coup√©; the other, doing away with the characteristic bulging wings in favour of more conventional ones, became the so-called \\"fianchi stretti\\" (Italian for \\"narrow hips\\") spider. The latter car was the only Disco Volante to be raced in period‚Äîbeing fielded in some competitions during 1953‚Äîsince the program did not progress past the experimental stage. Two more cars with the original spider body style were built fitted with a 3,495 cc, cast iron block, double overhead camshaft straight-six engine from the contemporary Alfa Romeo 6C 3000 CM racing car in place of the all-alloy four-cylinder; one was dismantled soon after its construction. Thanks to an output of at , the 3.5-litre Disco Volante could reach a top speed of .

He has worked with the European editions of Donald Duck and Woody Woodpecker. Familien Gnuff and Villiam are two of his own comics creations. Since the start of his career in the 1970s, he has worked for Danish, Swedish and Dutch comics publishers. During the 2010s he has also acted as a novelist. Biography=Background and 1970s Milton was born in Overlund, in Jutland and near Viborg. His first published comic strip was the realistic police series Zenit, produced in 1972‚Äì1973 for Jyllands-Posten. The following year Milton completed his training as a teacher at the Skive Seminarium. Freddy Milton's comics career took off in 1974, when he became involved with the Swedish publishing company Semic Press. There he worked with the comic book adaptions of old newspaper strips, while drawing his and Magnus Knutsson's Sherlock Holmes parody Hairlock Shomes (in Danish known as Sheerluck Homes) for the comics anthology Seriemagasinet. Most of Milton's works during the 1970s appeared in his own comics publication Sejd. It was published between 1973 and 1978, and amongst the strips debuting there were Familien Gnuff (1974‚Äì1978). During that same period, he also started the fanzine Carl Barks & Co, a Donaldistic magazine focusing on the Disney artist Carl Barks together with articles on animation. Freddy Milton and Daan Jippes in 2008, at the Helsinki book fair. In 1975, Milton started a collaboration with the Dutch artist Daan Jippes on Disney comics stories. This led to the production of 10-page Donald Duck stories for the Dutch publisher Oberon and the Dutch comic book Donald Duck Weekblad. This phase of his career ended in 1982, after 18 collaboratively produced stories. A complete collection of these stories are being published in English in 2018 by Fantagraphics, as part of the book collection Disney Masters. 1980s Freddy Milton moved to Copenhagen in 1980, and there he made a living from drawing European Disney comics and from translation work for Semic Press and its Danish subsidiary Interpresse. During the following years, Interpresse released two Milton albums with Woody Woodpecker. They were also published in Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. Later, Milton wrote stories with Woody Woodpecker and Familien Gnuff for the monthly comic book S√∏ren Sp√¶tte (the Danish name for Woody Woodpecker) and the Scandinavian subsidiary versions. These stories were also collected into album format. Over the years, Milton developed his own comics style containing social consciousness in a Disney-influenced drawing tradition. This social criticism was especially prominent of his adult comics like Villiams Verden (1982, followed by Villiams anden Verden in 1984) and the album series Dekalog over Janteloven (a series of stories built upon the satirical take on the Ten Commandments by author Aksel Sandemose). In 2002‚Äì2003 the latter was translated into Swedish by Seriefr√§mjandet, under the title Villiam's V√§rld: Dekalog √∂ver Jantelagen. Towards the end of the 1980s, Milton was involved in producing role-playing books, with titles such as Hvem myrdede Kock-Robin?, Dr√∏je dage i job-junglen, Jagten p√• Den vise Sten and Video eller virkelighed? In addition, he contributed to the production of a number of comics albums for LEGO; these albums were also released in Sweden (Borgungarna) and in Germany (Burg Donnerstein). Later years In 1995 Milton started the humorous Viking strip Svend, Knud & Valdemar, produced for the monthly magazine Glimt. This comic strip has since 2001 been released in album format under the name Jomsvikingerne (see Jomsvikings). Two years later, however, he returned to the funny animal scene through a transposition into comics of K. H. Wieth's children's story Musebogen. In parallel, Milton continued to draw Disney comics for the Netherlands, now without Jippes and sometimes after his own scripts. During the 2010s, Freddy Milton has also served as a novelist, often in the dystopian genre with stories from a bleak future. In 2014, the publisher Limbo released Fort Europa. In 2016 came Svinef√¶lden and in 2017 Algernon. Family Freddy Milton was married to Bodil Larsen during the years 1984‚Äì2000. Together they have four children.

The Deputy Judge Advocate of New South Wales was the senior legal officer of the colony and functioned in many ways as a Chief Justice. Bent was the first barrister to be appointed to a judicial office in the infant colony in an era when military officers were commonly appointed to the position. Bent Street in Sydney, Bent's Basin and Ellis Bent Road, Greendale near the Warragamba Dam are named after him. Early years and education Bent was born in 1783 although his birthdate is sometimes recorded as 1779.Serle He was the second son of Robert Bent and the younger brother of Jeffery Bent. He grew up in Surrey, England on the family estate Moulsey. He was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in 1804 and a Master of Arts in 1807. He was called to the Bar in 1805 practising in England for a number of years. He was described as a tall and rather heavy man, and his health was poor. Judge-advocate He was appointed by Lord Bathurst as the deputy judge-advocate of the colony of New South Wales as from 1 January 1809. He arrived at Sydney on 1 January 1810 on board HMS Dromedary, which happened to be carrying the new Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie. Bent took over from his predecessor Richard Atkins who was generally regarded in the colony as incompetent. The role of deputy judge-advocate (commonly referred to as the \\"judge-advocate\\") placed Bent as the primary judicial member of the colony. He presided with six military officers in the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, which was the only criminal court of colony which dealt with serious criminal crimes and was the only court which could sentence a person to death. He also presided with two nominees appointed by the governor in the Court of Civil Jurisdiction, which was the principal civil court of the colony. He held a commission to preside in the Vice-Admiralty Court to deal with admiralty issues that arose from time to time. He lastly presided with another magistrate as the Bench of Magistrates to deal with less serious criminal matters in Sydney. Bent was well regarded by Macquarie initially, and set about his role of judge-advocate with vigor and good faith. In recognition, Macquarie had a new residence built for Bent, which was completed in June 1812.Currey Legal reform in the colony Bent made recommendations to Lord Bathurst concerning the administration of justice in the colony. Some of these related to the introduction of jury trial in the colony and the creation of a new superior court to deal with civil matters. For this latter court, he proposed that a judge be appointed to sit with two magistrates. Macquarie recommended that the plan be adopted and suggested to the English authorities that Bent should be made the first judge of any such court created. Bent was passed over for the position, and instead it was offered to his brother Jeffrey Bent. The establishment of this latter court, the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature (commonly referred to as the Supreme Court) lessened the workload of Bent as the Court of Civil Jurisdiction over which he presided was abolished as a result of the establishment of that Supreme Court. Bent was quite progressive for the time. He allowed ex-convict lawyers to appear before his court when such a course was not possible in England under English law. He did this was allowing them to appear as agents of the parties, rather than formally admitting the lawyers as officers of the court. This met with general approval in the colony as it was a practical solution which facilitated the application of justice in the colony at a time when the colony was in its infancy. It has to be remembered that Bent was the first lawyer to emigrate to the colony of his own free will. Later years Macquarie and Bent were to be at loggerheads in the later years of Bent's appointment. They firstly disagreed over the independence of the judiciary, something that is taken for granted today in common law countries. Macquarie took the view that Bent's commission required him to obey the orders and directions of the governor in all times. Bent took the view that he should only obey the \\"lawful\\" instructions of the governor. Secondly, Bent came under the influence of his brother. Unfortunately, Bent's brother proved to be the opposite of Bent and was obstructive at every possible time. Whilst Bent had been initially progressive in allowing convict lawyers to appear in the Court of Civil Jurisdiction to assist litigants as agents, he sided with his brother that they should not be allowed to appear in the newly created Supreme Court of Civil Judicature to which his brother had been appointed. This raised Macquarie's ire as it impeded the ability of the new court to function. Lastly, Bent clashed with Macquarie over the introduction of new shipping rules for the colony. Bent had initially concurred with Macquarie's shipping rules in 1810. However, in 1814, when Macquarie provided a draft set of revised rules, Bent found them to be unnecessary and some to be illegal. Closing days The mounting differences between Macquarie, Bent and Bent's brother led Macquarie to write to Lord Bathurst offering to resign unless both Bents were removed from office. Bathurst did so in January 1816, siding with Macquarie rather than the Bents. Before notification of Bent's dismissal arrived in the colony, Bent had died on 10 November 1815. Bent left a widow and four children, and a fifth child was born subsequently to his death. Unfortunately, he left no estate to his wife and children on his death. Macquarie graciously wrote to Lord Bathurst recommending the payment of a pension to widow in view of Bent's services to the colony. Bathurst approved, and a pension of ¬£200 a year was granted to Mrs Bent in 1817. She subsequently returned to England. Ellis Bent headstone, Botany Bay Cemetery Burial Bent was buried at Old Sydney Burial Ground, now the site of Sydney Town Hall. He was buried there rather than at Garden Island (upon which Bent had a lease) because of his earlier disagreements with Macquarie. In 1823 Bents vault was removed to Garden Island. Later, after 1825 when Brevet-Major John Ovens died, he was also removed to Garden Island in accordance with Bent's earlier wishes. Later, his sandstone tomb was transferred to the Rest Park in St Thomas' Cemetery. His headstone is located at the Botany Cemetery, Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. where many of the headstones from the old Devonshire Street Cemetery were relocated. ReferencesSources *C. H.

Arrested for having forged evidence against Alfred Dreyfus, he was found dead in his prison cell. He was considered a hero by the Anti- Dreyfusards. Early life and career Hubert-Joseph Henry was born into a farming family. He enlisted in the French Army as an infantryman in 1865. Promoted to sergeant-major in 1868 Henry served in the Franco-Prussian War, escaping twice as a prisoner of war. In 1870, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in an infantry regiment. In 1875 Henry was appointed as an aide to General de Miribel, Chief of the General Staff. Four years later Henry, now a captain, joined the Statistics Section of the Ministry of War - the office responsible for counter-intelligence. He subsequently served in Tunisia, Tonkin and Algeria before returning to counter-intelligence duties in Paris. Lieutenant Colonel Georges Picquart, appointed new chief of army's intelligence section in 1895, was convinced that Major Henry had forged a document in order to prove definitively that Alfred Dreyfus was a traitor in favor of Germany. Thanks to the general staff's and government's support Henry was promoted Lieutenant Colonel, whereas Picquart was initially removed from office, the army, and even arrested. Dreyfus affair In August 1898, Minister of War Godefroy Cavaignac ordered Captain Louis Cuignet to examine the documents which sent Captain Dreyfus to his exile from France to Devil's Island. This matter should have been brought before Parliament, owing to the impossibility of obtaining a revision of the legal process, but due to Cavaignac's nature he threw caution to the wind. Cuignet soon learned that the most damning evidence brought to the court in 1896 by Henry was in fact a forgery using two separate documents, later known as the \\"faux Henry,\\" to achieve the sentence he and his supporters desired. Henry was called in for questioning on 30 August by Cavaignac and managed to protest his innocence for only an hour before he confessed. This led to the resignations of Generals de Pellieux and de Boisdeffre, who admitted having been duped by the forgery. Imprisonment and death Henry was sent to the military prison at Fort Mont- Val√©rien. The day after he arrived he began to write: to his wife, \\"I see that except for you everyone is going to abandon me\\"; to his superior General Gonse, \\"I absolutely must speak to you\\"; in one cryptic comment seemingly implying his guilt he wrote \\"You know in whose interest I acted.\\" The meaning of this comment has never been explained; it may have referred to Ferdinand- Walsin Esterhazy, who was the actual author of the bordereau document, which had been used to arrest Captain Dreyfus, or perhaps to Lt Col Sandherr, another superior who passed on the bordereau to other high-ranking officers, such as the Minister of War, General Auguste Mercier. Henry was found dead in his cell on the morning of 31 August 1898, having died at some point the previous night. The cause of death was a wound to the throat. While halfway through a bottle of rum and midway through another letter to his wife, Henry wrote \\"I am like a Madman\\" and proceeded to slit his throat with a shaving razor. On the day of his arrest, the Colonel had been searched and no razor had been found; this sparked another outcry of murder. However, due to Henry's actions, letters and state of mind, a cause of suicide was declared. Post- death and the Henry Monument At first anti-Dreyfusards such as √âdouard Drumont and Henri Rochefort upon hearing of Henry's suicide felt as though it was as good as declaring the guilt of a forged document and therefore Dreyfus' innocence to the people of France.

It is also San Antonio's only health system recognized by U.S. News & World Report, regarded as one of America's Best Hospitals. Owned and operated by Bexar County, it is the third largest public health system in Texas. The hospital is also the site of the Genene Jones murders, one of the largest serial killer cases in American History. The current teaching hospital sits at the same site as the original area hospital, The Robert E. Green Memorial Hospital, which opened in 1917. In 1968, the site underwent major updates when the University of Texas Medical School at San Antonio was constructed alongside the newly built Bexar County Hospital. As the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, University Hospital is a regional Level I Trauma Center and a leader in organ transplantation. The facility is located in the South Texas Medical Center.  Genene Jones Serial Killer Case and Controversy  The hospital is also the site of one of the most notorious serial killings in American history. During the late 1970s, the nurse Genene Jones is believed to have murdered as many as 60 infants at the hospital using injections of digoxin and heparin. Having suspicions about her role in the deaths, hospital administrators chose to make blanket staffing changes in order to avoid controversy and an investigation, which allowed Jones to kill an additional infant at another medical facility. It is widely believed that the hospital administration also destroyed evidence in order to escape legal liability. Jones was eventually only convicted for two deaths, including Rolando Santos while he was a patient at Bexar County Hospital. Expansion University Hospital is undergoing a $778 million expansion and renovation designed by the Dallas office of Perkins + Will. The expansion is expected to increase the number of beds from the current 498 to more than 700, and to nearly double floor space to about 2 million square feet. In addition to adding on a new section, the existing two towers will be renovated and the helicopter pad will be moved from the south parking garage to the roof of a 10-story parking garage under construction. New Women's & Children Tower A Women & Children's Tower with 250 private rooms is expected to open in 2022 during the second phase of University Health System's capital improvement program. The project features a heart, vascular and endoscopy suite, new parking structure and an additional shell space for future growth. The new tower plans features special amenities for mothers and babies, and will be prepared to care for high-risk deliveries and complications during and after pregnancy. There will be a dedicated Obstetrics and Gynecology Emergency Department, Caesarian- section rooms, and a level IV neonatal intensive care unit connected to the labor and delivery unit. The tower is also expected to be equipped to care for sick or injured children with a Children's Emergency Department, a pediatric rehabilitation gym and family friendly rooms.

Early life As Creager has explained in a 2011 interview, he commenced skateboarding at the age of three: > My neighbor Mike Skinner introduced skateboarding to me around the age of > three. He basically brainwashed me as a small child by pushing me around on > his board when my mind was just developing. My first real board was a Sure- > Grip that belonged to my sister, but the one I remember the most from early > on was a Ken Park. I had all the plastic accessories on it‚Äîplus Rip Grip and > cut-up griptape in all different colors. But back then, the only things that > mattered to me were the wheels. If I could roll, I was in business. Professional skateboarding Creager specializes in technical street skating and for more than twenty years his professional skateboard footage has frequently featured ledge structures (Creager produced a ledge skateboarding instructional video segment for TransWorld SKATEboarding magazine in 2011). Creager was a senior member of the Blind Skateboards team and stated that it felt unstable when he first joined the company: > It was scary. At one point, I was the only rider on the team. I was worried. > I had lost a sponsor before and knew how it felt, but this time was > different: it wasn‚Äôt about getting kicked off‚Äîit was that the company might > fall apart. In 2011, Creager revealed that he had been with the company for almost twenty years, stating that his entire skateboarding career has been devoted to the brand: \\"I‚Äôve dedicated my whole skate career to Blind and stood behind the company in times of both good and bad but I‚Äôm confident that Blind will take care of me.\\" Creager was sponsored by Tensor, the skateboard truck brand founded by skateboard pioneer Rodney Mullen‚ÄîCreager released signature truck models with the brand. As of September 2013, Creager is a team rider for the Theeve truck brand. Since 2011, Creager has become increasingly involved with The Berrics website that is owned by professional skateboarders Steve Berra and Eric Koston. In addition to being sponsored by the Berrics brand, Creager is often featured in the website's video segments and on January 14, 2013, the website released a birthday video that featured Creager skating in the Berrics training facility. The Blind company published a media release on March 13, 2014 stating that Creager had parted ways with the company. Creager's future plan for a board sponsor was not included as part of the announcement. Creager is described as \\"a one of a kind inspiration to all of us at Blind, the team, everyone at Dwindle and skaters worldwide,\\" with \\"uncanny board control and effortless style,\\" whose \\"parts are timeless and serve as inspiration for skaters of all ages from every corner of the globe.\\" Speculation arose on the internet about whether Creager will join the Almost Skateboards team, as a photo of an Almost board is posted on Creager's Facebook page on March 6, 2014. Sponsors As of September 2013, Creager is sponsored by High School Dropout‚Ñ¢, Etcetera Project, The Skateboard Club, Mob Grip and Keen Ramps. Company owner Creager launched a skateboard accessories brand in 2011, entitled \\"Etcetera\\". According to the brand's publicity, the company \\"is committed to creating and innovating new products for skateboarding.\\" As of September 2012, Etcetera produces the following accessories for the retail market: \\"Primo Insoles\\", \\"Ankle Stabiliser\\", \\"Lace Belt\\", and the \\"Wall Ride\\" skateboard deck-storage device. Creager explained the idea behind the brand in a 2011 interview: > It‚Äôs an accessories line designed to help keep skaters on their boards > instead of nursing an injury. Ankle braces you can skate in, fully padded > insoles and other products that I need to keep under wraps for a just little > longer. It‚Äôs been in the works for a long time now. I just think it‚Äôs crazy > that some of these ideas skaters come up with never get made, so that‚Äôs why > we exist. Etcetera also sponsors a team that consists of Lizard King, Jordan Hoffart, Manny Santiago, Ronnie Creager, Morgan Smith, Marc Johnson, and Chase Gabor (Johnson was added to the team in September 2012). Creager starred in a commercial for Etcetera, filmed at and near his home in California, US, and the production was published on the Internet in February 2012. Accolades In July 2013, professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez included Creager in his \\"top ten\\" list of favorite professional skateboarders. In addition to recommending Creager's 1996 Trilogy video part, Rodriguez explained the selection on his personal website: > I love that dude man. That guy, again.. style, creativity, technical > abilities, precision. I would always be captivated by his skateboarding > every time I would see anything from him. It seemed so easy and graceful > when you would see him skate. Personal life Creager currently resides in California, U.S., near Orange County.

While similar to the general movement of Orientalism in its negative outlook upon Western Asian ‚Äì especially Arab ‚Äì culture and religion, it differs in both its emphasis upon the role of the Arab slave trade and the Coolie slave trade in the historic dialogue between sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab ‚Äì and greater Muslim ‚Äì world, as well as a lack of colonial promotion over the Middle East region as was promoted by European orientalism in the same region. The term \\"black orientalism\\" was first used by Kenyan academic Ali Mazrui in his critique of Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s documentary Wonders of the African World. Supporters of this movement include writers such as Chinweizu.

St. Crepinus and St. Crepinianus, martyrs (c. 288), are patrons of the diocese. According to Louis Duchesne, the establishment of a see at Soissons dates from about 300. The territory of Soissons and Laon played an important political part under the Merovingians. After the death of Clovis (511), Soissons was the capital of one of the four kingdoms into which his states were divided. The Kingdom of Soissons, which ceased to exist in 558, when Clotaire I reunited all the Frankish states, came into being again in 561 when the death of Clotaire led to a redivision of the territory. It finally disappeared in 613 when the Frankish lands were once more reunited under Clotaire II. It was re-established by the Concordat of 1802 as suffragan of Paris, but in 1821 it became suffragan of Reims. It consists of *all the ancient Diocese of Soissons, except the civil district of Compi√®gne, which went to the Diocese of Beauvais *all of the Diocese of Laon, except two parishes, which went to Reims *that portion of Vermandois which formerly belonged to the Diocese of Noyon *a few parishes which formerly belonged to Cambrai, Meaux, Troyes, Reims. See of LaonBishops of Soissons The Bishop of Soissons as senior suffragan of Reims had the privilege, during a vacancy of the metropolitan see, to replace the archbishop at the ceremony of anointing a King of France. The Bishop of Laon ranked as Duke and peer from the twelfth century. As second ecclesiastical peer, he had the privilege of holding the ampulla during the anointing of the king.

In May 864, Pope Nicholas wrote to Hincmar, complaining that Rothadus had neither been restored nor sent to Rome for judgment, and indeed that he had been detained (Hincmar had ordered Rothadus imprisoned in a monastery). On 20 January 865, Pope Nicholas wrote to Bishop Rothadus, who had been restored to his diocese of Soissons, restoring his possessions. P.

Hilduin, abbot (822‚Äì30), in 826 obtained from Pope Eugene II relics of St. Sebastian and St. Gregory the Great; he caused the relics of St. Godard and St. Remi to be transferred to the abbey; he rebuilt the church which was consecrated 27 August 841, in the presence of Charles the Bald and seventy-two prelates. The king bore the body of St. M√©dard into the new basilica. In 853 Charles the Bald presided over the Council of Soissons at Saint-Medard, in the company of fifty-one bishops. Bishop Rothadus of Soissons was deposed, due to the malevolence of Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, but restored on orders of Pope Nicholas I.Fisquet, pp. 150-154. The church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by Pope Innocent II, who granted those visiting the church indulgences known as \\"St. M√©dard's pardons\\". In this abbey Louis the Pious was imprisoned in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the abbots of St. M√©dard's are: St. Arnoul, who in 1081 became Bishop of Soissons; St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century); Cardinal de Bernis, made commendatory abbot of St. M√©dard in 1756. The Benedictine Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by Ebroin and his wife Leutrude. The Cistercian abbey of Longpont, founded in 1131, counted among its monks the theologian Pierre Cantor, who died in 1197, and Blessed John de Montmirail (1167‚Äì1217), who abandoned the court of Phillipe-Auguste in order to become a monk. The abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier monks were: St. Gobain, who, through love of solitude, retired to a desert place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward Bishop of Laon, who wished to die in his monastery; St. Humbert, first abbot of Maroilles in Hainaut. The abbey adopted the rule of St. Benedict. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, abbot of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the Benedictines of St. Maur. Among the abbots of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, abbot of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his monastery. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first abbess; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the abbey became a Benedictine monastery. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb√©ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its abbots were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112 and whose autobiography, \\"De Vita Sua\\" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title \\"Gesta Dei per Francos\\" he wrote an account of the First Crusade. The Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed Lucas de Roucy, dean of Laon, and followed the rule of Premonstratensians. In the Diocese of Soissons, the Premonstratensians had the abbeys: Chartreuve, Valsery, Saint-Yved de Braine, Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr√©tien, Lieurestaur√©. The portion of the ancient Diocese of Noyon within the jurisdiction of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was martyred under Diocletian. It was the chief town of a diocese until 532, when St. M√©dard, the titular, removed the see to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the Church of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of Charles Martel until 771, and again from 844 the abbots of St-Quentin were laymen and counts of Vermandois. The abbey church became the Saint-Quentin Basilica, built from the 12th to 15th centuries. During the Middle Ages a distinct type of religious architecture sprang up in Soissons; Eug√©ne Lef√®vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the cathedral of Laon, as it exists, is not the one consecrated in 1114 and visited by Innocent II in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150‚Äì1225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), and Philip I (1059) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, Abbot of St. Martin's of Tournai, wrote a volume on the miracles of Notre Dame of Laon. The H√¥tel-Dieu of Laon, once known as H√¥tellerie Notre Dame, was founded in 1019 by the Laon chapter. The H√¥tel-Dieu of Ch√¢teau Thierry was founded in 1304 by Jeanne, wife of Philip the Fair. Saints The following are honoured as connected with the religious history of the diocese: St. Marculfus, Abbot of Nanteuil (sixth century) in the Diocese of Coutances, whose relics, transferred to Corbeny in the Diocese of Laon, were visited by the kings of France who, after their anointing at Reims, were wont to go to the tomb of St. Marculfus to cure the king's evil. Among the natives of the diocese may be mentioned: Petrus Ramus (1515‚Äì72), Jean Racine (1639‚Äì99), La Fontaine (1621‚Äì95), Dom Luc d'Achery (1609‚Äì1685), Charlevoix (1683‚Äì1761), Camille Desmoulins (1760‚Äì1794). Before the application of the Congregations Law (1901), there were in the Diocese of Soissons Jesuits, Trinitarians, and several teaching congregations of brothers. Some congregations of women had their origin in the diocese: the Nursing and Teaching Sisters of the Child Jesus, with mother-house at Soissons, founded in 1714 by the Madame Brulard de Genlis; the Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Charly; Sisters of Notre Dame, nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at Saint-Erme, founded in 1820 by the Abb√© Chr√©tien; the Franciscan sisters of the Sacred Heart, a nursing order, founded in 1867, with mother-house at St-Quentin; the Servants of the Heart of Jesus, of whom there are two branches, the \\"Marys\\" who lead a contemplative life, and the \\"Marthas\\" who nurse the sick; they were founded at Strasburg in 1867, and brought to St-Quentin after the war of 1870‚Äì1.

History  Jean-Paul Huchon, the French civil administrator and politician's dedication plaque on Beirut's National Park. In the 13th century, William of Tyre (or ), the medieval prelate, chronicler and the archbishop of Tyre, named the forest of Beirut, as \\"La Pin√©e\\" or \\"Sapinoie\\". The park, Horsh, has suffered throughout history from frequent abuse of its timber especially by the armies of the Crusaders, Mamluks, Ottomans, and the Allies of World War II to build ships and weapons.Al-Wali, T. (1993). Beirut fi'Tarikh wal'Hadara wal'Omran (Beirut: History, Culture, and Urbanism). Beirut: Dar al-Elem lil'Malayeen. pp. 106-107. Large parts of the pine forest were segmented-out to become an Ottoman Casino in 1917 (which became the Pine Residence later during the French Mandate of Lebanon), a horse racecourse in 1921, Al-Shohadaa Cemetery in 1958, and Rawdat al-Shaheedein Cemetery in the 1970s. Moreover, the development of new roads during the 1950s state planning produced some leftovers of the remaining woodland that became subject to conflict and appropriation. Horsh was bombed to burn by Israeli jet fighters during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Much of it was also turned into a Palestinian refugee camp. From a pine forest over 1,250,000 m2 in 1696 it decreased to a park over 800,000 m2 in 1967 (‚âà 5% of Municipal Beirut),Al- Wali, T. (1993). Beirut fi'Tarikh wal'Hadara wal'Omran (Beirut: History, Culture, and Urbanism). Beirut: Dar al-Elem lil'Malayeen. Today, Horsh Beirut is a triangular park at the southern border of the city limited by Omar Beyhum Street, 22 November Avenue, Abdelnasser Avenue and National Museum of Beirut (Mus√©e national de Beyrouth). It lies along the axis of the old airport road amidst areas of Mazraa, Tarik el-Jdideh, Qasqas, Sabra, Ghobeyri, Shiyah, Furn el-Shebak, and Badaro while it is separated from Ras el-Nabaa by the Beirut Hippodrome. The park, or Horsh Beirut, has been reconstructed after the end of the Lebanese Civil War and it has been closed for the general public for about 25 years. Lebanese citizens had to apply for a permission and only have chances to get one if they are older than 35 years. At the same time there have been reports of Western foreigners getting permission while applications by Lebanese were rejected.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXfM93OFGNQ Beirut residents have repeatedly protested against the denial of access to the park including the unequal access policies for Western and non-Western park visitors. However, it ended up being reopened to the public by the governor of Beirut, Ziad Chebib, on September 3, 2015, in what was considered a victory for civil society after constantly demanding its reopening to all Lebanese citizens.

Janders were very common during the barter economy era but have been replaced by diesel and electric mills which are more efficient and are able to operate all year, as they are not dependent on seasonal rains. They are also more accessible than janders, which had to be located on the banks of running streams, generally some distance away from where people lived. Some janders are still operating in the foothills. The local tribes of the Murree Hills such as the Dhanyal, Abbasi and Satti were the main users of these traditional mills.  Parts  A Jander consists of three main parts: 1\\\\. The fan (operated by water flowing from an elevated point). 2\\\\. Millstones (two large wheel-like structures that rotate on an axle and can weigh up to a ton. They are rotated by the fans). 3\\\\. The cone (used to funnel grain between the millstones for grinding).  Operation  A jander operates as follows: Water is stored at a small, elevated, dam-like collection point. Typically, the water is diverted from a large stream or mill pond to the water wheel along a channel or pipe (also known as a flume or head race). The potential energy of the water's movement drives the blades of a wheel and converts it to mechanical energy, which in turn rotates an axle that drives the jander's mill stones. Water leaving the wheel is drained through a tail race. The passage of water is controlled by gates that allow some measure of flood control. There are two types of janders: one with a horizontal water wheel on a vertical axle, and the other with a vertical wheel on a horizontal axle. The horizontal janders are the older design. The force of the water would strike a simple paddle wheel set horizontally in line with the water. This then turned a runner stone balanced on the rynd atop a shaft leading directly up from the wheel. The bed stone does not turn. The problem with this type of mill was the lack of gearing. The speed of the water set the maximum speed of the runner stone which, in turn, set the rate of milling.

It covers an area of about in the Lushai Hills at an altitude range of . It was declared a tiger reserve in 1994 and is part of Project Tiger. The tropical forests of Dampa Tiger Reserve are home to a diverse flora and fauna. It consists of forest interpolated with steep precipitous hills, deep valleys, jungle streams, ripping rivulets, natural salts licks. Dampa Tiger Reserve is not easily accessible unlike other park where you can ride on a four wheeler but one has to walk through the forest if one wishes to sight animals. In the tiger census of 2018, no tiger was found in this reserve. Etymology The word Dampa means \\"lonely men\\" and refers to a local narrative about a village, where a lot of the women died. History The protected area was initially established as wildlife sanctuary in 1985 with an area of about , which was reduced to about . In 1994, it received the status of a Tiger Reserve with an area of and thus became part of Project Tiger. Jurisdiction is under two ranges, namely Teirei Range and Phuldungsei Range. Workers consist of a field director who is headquartered in W. Phaileng. There are also about five foresters and 10 regular forest guards. Flora Rare floral species have been found in Dampa Tiger Reserve including rare ginger species Globba spathulata and Hemiorchis pantlingii. Fauna= Mammals  Dampa Tiger Reserve hosts Indian leopard, sloth bear, gaur, serow, barking deer, wild boar, hoolock gibbon, Phayre's leaf monkey, gray langur, Rhesus macaque and slow loris. Four Bengal tigers were recorded in 1994 but none were recorded in 2019. Dampa Tiger Reserve has one of the highest clouded leopard populations in South and South East Asia. In 2012, tiger presence was confirmed through Scat samples. No tiger was recorded in Dampa Tiger Reserve in the years 2018‚Äì2019. However, the National Tiger Conservation Authority recommended that tigers from Assam‚Äôs Kaziranga National Park be introduced to Dampa Tiger Reserve.  Birds  Bird species sighted in Dampa Tiger Reserve include great hornbill, wreathed hornbill, oriental pied hornbill, scarlet- backed flowerpecker, Kalij pheasant, grey peacock-pheasant, speckled piculet and white-browed piculet, bay woodpecker, greater yellownape, greater flameback, great barbet, blue-throated barbet, red-headed trogon, Indian cuckoo, Asian barred owlet, green imperial pigeon, mountain imperial pigeon, emerald dove, crested serpent eagle, Malayan night heron, long-tailed broadbill, Asian fairy bluebird, blue-winged leafbird, golden-fronted leafbird, orange-bellied leafbird, scarlet minivet, maroon oriole, greater racket-tailed drongo, Indian paradise-flycatcher, pale-chinned blue flycatcher, blue-throated flycatcher, black-naped monarch, grey-headed canary flycatcher, white-rumped shama, slaty-backed forktail, spotted forktail, chestnut-bellied nuthatch, velvet-fronted nuthatch, black bulbul, black- crested bulbul, ashy bulbul, white-throated bulbul, slaty-bellied tesia and striated yuhina. Threat It has been reported that there has been an increase in built up (590%), bamboo forest (192.89%) and scrub (74.67%) areas. These increases are simultaneously accompanied by decrease in cover area of evergreen/semi evergreen closed forests from 152.47 km2 in 1978 to 95.27 km2 in 2005. This could be due to the practice of shifting cultivation by villagers at the border of the reserve. A 62-km fence and patrol road along the Bangladesh boundary near the reserve in Mizoram is hindering the free movement of Tigers at Dampa. Oil palm and Teak plantations which occupy areas close to the Dampa Tiger Reserve are also reducing habitat of birds and animals and could pose a bigger threat to wildlife than shifting cultivation. There have also been reported cases of poaching by different groups including local hunters and insurgent groups like Shanti Bahini and the National Liberation Front of Tripura.

The movement began in the writings of Maraimalai Adigal, Paventhar Bharathidasan, Devaneya Pavanar, and Pavalareru Perunchitthiranaar, and was propagated in the Thenmozhi literary magazine founded by Pavalareru Perunchithiranar. V G Suryanarayana Sastri (popularly known as Parithimar Kalaignar), a Professor, was a 20th-century figure in the movement; in 1902 he demanded classical-language status for Tamil, which it received in 2004.  Movement Thani Tamiƒº Iyakkam's Parithimar Kalaignar. He (translated) changed his name from the Sanskrit 'Suryanarayana Sastri' to Tamil 'Parithimaar kalaignar'. Perunchithiranar, Father of Tamilnation The modern revival of the Tamil Purist Movement (also known as the Pure Tamil Movement) is attributed to Maraimalai Adigal, who publicly pledged to defend pure Tamil in 1916. Advocates of purism popularised Tamil literature and advocated for it, organising rallies in villages and towns and making Tamil purism a political issue. The logical extension of this effort was to purge Tamil of the Sanskrit influence (including its negative social perceptions, which they believed to keep the Tamils in a state of economic, cultural, and political servitude) seen as making Tamil susceptible to northern political domination. Anti- Sanskrit and anti-Hindi Tamil Nadu policies brought them into conflicts with the Brahmins, who supported North Indian languages even while they lived in Tamil Nadu. Tamil was given some national sovereignty by a language policy after Indian independence and had been used in some high schools since 1938 (and in universities from 1960). In 1956, the Indian National Congress government passed a law making Tamil the official language of Tamil Nadu, and in 1959 set up the Tamil Development and Research Council to produce Tamil textbooks in the natural and human sciences, accounting, mathematics, and other subjects. A series of children's encyclopaedias, commentaries on Sangam poetry, and a history of the Tamil people were published in 1962-63. However, these measures seemed insufficient to the proponents of \\"Pure Tamil\\", as expressed by Mohan Kumaramangalam in 1965 at the peak of the anti-Hindi agitation: > In practice, the ordinary man finds that the Tamil language is nowhere in > the picture ... In Madras city like any other metro, English dominates our > life to an extraordinary extent ... I think it will be no exaggeration to > say that a person who earns very high can live for years in Madras without > learning a word of Tamil, except for some servant inconvenience! Since the Congress government had turned down a number of demands, such as the use of \\"pure\\" rather than \\"Sanskritised Tamil\\" in schoolbooks and resisting the name change from Madras to Tamil Nadu until 1969, it seemed unconcerned about separatism. This bred resentment among Tamil purists, as expressed by Devaneya Pavanar in 1967: > None of the Congress Ministers of Tamil Nadu was either a Tamil scholar or a > Tamil lover. The Congress leaders of Tamil Nadu as betrayers of Tamil, > cannot represent the State any more. Blind cannot lead the blind, much less > the keen sighted. Moreover every political meeting, they will say \\"Jai > Hind!\\". This Means, they are meant to rule only in broader (not specific) > India. In the elections that year, Congress was replaced by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government under C N Annadurai. The Tamil purism movement successfully lobbied for Tamil to be declared a \\"classical language\\" (vuyarthanichemai) of India in 2006, a status also accorded to Sanskrit in the Indian constitution. This gave rise to the Centre for the Study of Tamil as a Classical Language in Chennai, but it took another year to obtain official Tamil translations in Tamil Nadu courts.

It was an initiative of John Tyndall of the British National Front but received no funding from the British NF.New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies History The NFA was established originally in 1977 as a sister organisation of the British National Front; sister organisations were also formed in New Zealand and South Africa at the same time. It did not become fully operative until 1978.What happened when the British National Front tried to set up in Australia thirty years ago? NFA followed Tyndall's British imperial view and called for a ‚Äúregenerated British Australia‚Äù. Like the sister organisations, it sought to align itself with other right-wing and racist groups. However, its British Australian nationalism and anti-immigrant stance separated it from the more Europeanist/Americanist 'white race' neo-Nazi far-right that was emerging in Australia, many of whose members were themselves immigrants rather than of British origin. The first party Chairman was Rosemary Sisson. Branches were formed in Victoria, with Sisson as branch secretary; in Queensland, with Victor Robb as branch secretary; and in New South Wales with neo-Nazi Robert Cameron as branch secretary. Divisions emerged between the Victoria and New South Wales branches.New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies Cameron was later joined by fellow neo-Nazi Ross \\"the skull\\" May during the 1980s. Cameron was accused of being an \\"informer-provocateur\\" and that his presence discredited the party as a 'respectable' right-wing party.Jim Saleam The Other Radicalism chapter 4 From June 1978 the party published a magazine called Frontline, in collaboration with the National Front of New Zealand. Victor Robb was the party's first electoral candidate in 1978. He \\"campaigned at the time on a platform of making Australia racially pure\\".

He is a founding member of the American rock band Huey Lewis and the News. He has been heavily involved in the San Francisco Bay Area music scene for decades, having been in several other bands, including Rubicon, Sly and the Family Stone, Van Morrison, Sound Hole, and Johnny Colla & The Lucky Devils. Johnny has two children, Allison Colla and Ryan Colla. History with bands The first bands that Colla was involved with from Fairfield, CA were The Furlanders, The Yewess Army and Cottonmouth. In the early seventies he relocated to Marin County, CA and joined Sound Hole as a singer and saxophonist. Sound Hole was successful at a local level and became Van Morrison's backing band for a time. Other members of Sound Hole were drummer Bill Gibson and bassist Mario Cipollina, who also eventually ended up with Huey and The News. Sound Hole was the major local competition to Huey's band, Clover. After Sound Hole, Colla was enlisted as sax man/arranger with Sly and the Family Stone, recording and touring with Sly for a few years. In the late 1970s Sound Hole and Clover alumni merged to form a new group, the American Express, which later became known as Huey Lewis and the News. For the News, Colla became saxophonist, rhythm guitarist, backing singer and songwriter. Colla was drawn to San Francisco from the Sacramento Valley during the 1960s Summer of Love. Like many others, Colla patronized the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore Auditorium, eventually pursuing his idols and musical dreams over the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County. > \\"I moved to Marin because that's where all the musicians moved after the San > Francisco scene blew up. For a start-up musician in the seventies, it was a > hot-bed of musical activity; a great place to be and be heard.\\" He says. > \\"Then I beat the odds. We not only started a great band, but actually became > successful at it!\\" Colla co-wrote hit songs such as \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\\", \\"If This Is It\\", \\"The Power of Love\\", and \\"Back in Time\\". Lewis and Colla co-produced the band's 2001 album Plan B, and they are currently working on a new HLN project. Solo career Colla embarked upon a solo career to expand his personal musical horizons, releasing his first solo album Lucky Devil in the mid 1990s. He released his second solo album, I Hear Voices, in 2012, which takes a more vocal approach than Lucky Devil, and he is currently working on an a cappella version of the same CD.

History After Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry gained the franchise to operate part of the cross harbour ferry routes, including the Central ‚Äì Yau Ma Tei route, starting from 1 January 1924, the company set up Yaumatei Ferry Pier at Public Square Street for its ferry operations. In 1933 a new vehicular ferry route from Central to Yau Ma Tei was started, and Jordan Road Ferry Pier was built to handle vehicular ferries. Original ferry operations also moved to the new pier. A new bus terminus was built outside the pier. However, the demand for the pier started to decline after the opening of Cross Harbour Tunnel in 1972 and commencement of complete operation of the Modified Initial System of MTR in 1980. In 1996 the pier was demolished due to reclamation in west Kowloon, and operations moved to the nearby Canton Road Government Dockyards Temporary Pier still under the name of Jordan Road Ferry Pier. All ferry routes from the pier were suspended starting from 2 February 1998.

This program extends the base curriculum. Although the TDSB closed the school in June 2018 due to low enrolment, the school facility is currently used to temporarily accommodate students from York Memorial Collegiate Institute. History and overview Scarlett refers to John Scarlett, an early land owner and entrepreneur in the area. Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was a graduate of the school. The school was originally constructed in 1962 under its working name, Hilltop Collegiate Institute at the cost of $1,311,800.00 ($11,100,260.48 in 2019 dollars) when the Etobicoke Board of Education approved the Hilltop application on December 19, 1961.http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1962D_MSBT-Minutes-1962.pdf The original design consisted of 9 standard classrooms, 1 art, 1 music, 3 science labs., a library, 1 home economics, 1 shop, 3 typing rooms, double gymnasium, cafeteria, secretarial, merchandising, accountancy, and business machines classrooms. Scarlett Heights Collegiate opened in September 1963. In the September 2006 issue of Toronto Life, Scarlett Heights was named ‚ÄúBest For Business‚Äù in the rating of the ‚Äú10 Best Schools In Toronto‚Äù. Students at Scarlett Heights are required to wear a uniform consisting of a white and grey shirt typically with the school's name imprinted on it; with black pants. Entrance to this academy requires students to demonstrate their commitment to a high academic achievement. Students wishing to apply for entrance complete an admissions portfolio, sign a learning contract, adhere to the Academy's uniform dress policy, and commit to a social responsibility component in the curriculum. Optional attendance students must have a minimum grade 8 average of 70% to be eligible for admission to the school. Approximately 700 students attend Scarlett annually. Most students come from Rexdale, Mimico, Islington, Scarlett Manor, Scarlett Wood Court, Dixon, Fontenay Court, Richview, La Rose as well as other parts of Toronto. The school is served by many different TTC routes, including 73C Royal York, 52 Lawrence West, 58 Malton, 32 Eglinton West and 37 Islington. Like many other high schools, overcrowding on the buses does occur, especially the 73C northbound towards Rexdale. The school contains a large gymnasium, a weight/fitness room, a library, a cafeteria, an auditorium, four full computer labs, two partial computer labs, an outdoor soccer field, basketball court and a newly paved jogging track, they also share a field with Hilltop Middle School. The school is also known for holding many sporting events including tryouts for kids basketball teams like Etobicoke Thunder. SHEA, along with most schools in Toronto, is an ethnically diverse school. The largest ethnic groups represented in the school include Somalis, Indians, Afghans, Serbs, and many others. Feeder schools include Hilltop Middle School and Dixon Grove Junior Middle School. Second life Due to the fire at York Memorial Collegiate Institute on May 6, 2019, Scarlett Heights property is proposed to be used as a temporary home for York Memorial students beginning in the 2019‚Äì20 school year.https://toronto.citynews.ca/2019/05/29/displaced-york-memorial-community- must-choose-new-home/  Notable alumni  * Rob Ford, 64th Mayor of Toronto (December 1, 2010 ‚Äì November 30, 2014). * Doug Ford, Jr., 26th Premier of Ontario, Former Toronto City Councillor for Ward 2, Toronto  In film  Some scenes for the movie Ginger Snaps (2000) and Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019) were filmed at the school.

The Castle of Sant'Aniceto (also San Niceto) is a Byzantine castle built in the early 11th century on a hill in Motta San Giovanni, now in the province of Reggio Calabria, southern Italy. It is one of the few examples of High Middle Ages architecture in Calabria, as well as one of the few well-preserved Byzantine fortifications in the world. The name derives from that of St. Nicetas, a Byzantine admiral who lived in the 7th-8th centuries. Towers of the Castle of Sant'Aniceto History The castle was built as a refuge and a warning place during a period in which the ravages of Saracen pirates on the Calabrian and Sicilian coasts were frequent. When the Normans conquered southern Italy, the structure was enlarged, with the addition of rectangular towers. In the 13th century the castle became the command center of the flourishing fief of Sant'Aniceto (which included Motta San Giovanni and Montebello). Two centuries later, entered in conflict with Reggio Calabria, and in 1459 it was destroyed by Alfonso of Calabria. Architecture The castles has an irregular plan, which reminds that of a ship with the bow directed towards the mountains and the aft to the sea. Nest to the entrance are two square towers. At the feet of the short steep path leading to the plain below is a small church, which has a frescoed dome portraying the Christ Pantokrator, a typical subject of Byzantine Art. The height of the well-preserved walls varies from 3 to 3.5 meters, and they are some one meters thick.

They were also the first boats to be fitted with wireless transmitters. Ten were laid down between 1907 and 1910, though only 8 were completed as D-class boats. The final two hulls were completed as British E-class submarine. Design and description The patrol submarines evolved from the C-class boats. They were designed to be propelled by diesel motors on the surface to avoid the problems with petrol engines experienced with the A class. These boats were designed for foreign service with an endurance of at on the surface and much improved living conditions for a larger crew. D-class boats were fitted with twin screws for greater manoeuvrability and were fitted with saddle tanks. The D class were the first submarines to be equipped with deck guns forward of the conning tower beginning with D6. Also, reserve buoyancy was increased to 20.6%. Armament also included three torpedo tubes (2 vertically in the bow and 1 in the stern). The D class was also the first class of British submarines to have standard radio fitted. The aerial was attached to the mast of the conning tower that was lowered before diving. With their enlarged bridge structure the boat profile was recognisably that of the modern submarine. The D-class submarines were considered to be so innovative that the prototype, D1, was built in utmost secrecy in a securely guarded building shed. She was launched at Barrow with equal secrecy, with only departmental heads and a few officers from the cruiser , that was currently in dock being present. Once moved to the fitting out berth, she was once again screened from view. The boats cost between ¬£79,910 and ¬£89,410 each excluding the deck gun. Operations The D class were based at Harwich, Immingham, Blyth and Dover. Their wartime role was to sink German warships. In the latter stages of World War I the D class were used for training crews based at Portsmouth. During World War I the boats patrolled the North Sea and the Heligoland Bight, and protected cross channel troopships. During the war, four boats (D2, D3, D5, and D6) were lost, and the remainder (D4, D7, and D8) were paid off in July 1919.

Following the death of Abu Hafs al-Urduni on 26 November 2006, he was named leader of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya, the battalion of foreign fighters once commanded by the notorious Saudi-born Ibn al-Khattab. Although Russian intelligence has claimed that he was a native of Jordan who served as a combat pilot (achieving the rank of Lieutenant) in the Jordanian Air Force and who also underwent military training in the United States this is not considered to be true. He is not Jordanian, it is reported in other sources that he was Saudi. He was killed by Russian security forces outside the village of Serzhen-Yurt, Chechnya on 21 April 2011. Early life Although little is reliably known of Muhannad's early life, he was born in 1969 and hailed from the Medina area of Saudi Arabia's western Hejaz region. It is said that he have graduated with honors from the Islamic University of Madinah and is believed to have descended from Al Ashraf, meaning ‚Äúfrom the family of the Prophet.‚Äù Rebel activity Muhannad arrived in the Caucasus in 1999 during the early days of the Second Chechen War, attempting to pass through Georgia into Chechnya. Upon arrival in the Pankisi Gorge ‚Äì a mountainous valley in northeastern Georgia inhabited mostly by ethnic Chechens known as Kists ‚Äì Muhannad waited almost two years for his opportunity to cross the border. During his time living amongst the Chechen refugees, Muhannad gave lectures on the history of Islam and advocated a ‚Äúpurer‚Äù form of the religion than that traditionally practiced by Chechens; it is perhaps no coincidence that Wahabbi influence began to appear in Pankisi around this same time. Muhannad was eventually able to gain entry into Chechnya with a group controlled by the Akhmadov brothers in 2001, arriving along with other prominent Arab fighters such as Abu Atiya, Abu Rabia, and others. Having acquired previous battlefield experience in Afghanistan,The Philippines, Bosnia, and Kosovo, Muhannad joined the battalion of Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya led by Khattab. In October 2006, Chechen Republic of Ichkeria president Dokka Umarov made Muhannad one of three deputies to Magomet 'Magas' Yevloyev, the Ingush commander of the separatist military wing then known as the Caucasian Front. The following month, Abu Hafs al-Urduni - the successor to Abu al-Walid (killed in 2004) and Khattab (killed in 2002) as commander of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya - was killed by Russian forces in Dagestan, leading to Muhannad's unanimous appointment as the new Emir on 9 December 2006. It is likely that in this same time period, he became the key facilitator connecting Chechen separatists to financial supporters in the Middle East. Following Umarov's declaration of a North Caucasus-wide insurgent organization called the Caucasus Emirate in September 2007, Muhannad was declared his naib, or deputy. In the meantime, Muhannad was also a ranking member of the rebel unit commanded by Aslambek Vadalov, and his participation in combat operations put him on equal footing with his indigenous counterparts, garnering him much respect. In February 2008, he was reportedly killed by officers of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) during a search operation near the village of Arshty in Ingushetia. Interfax, however, refuted Muhannad's death the same day, saying it was a different militant. Dokka Umarov later appeared on video with Muhannad to refute statements of his death, calling them lies and propaganda. According to different sources, Muhannad took part in attacks on Russian security forces in eastern Chechnya in 2008 and in western Chechnya along the border with Ingushetia in 2009. In January 2009, he issued a statement declaring the Caucasus Emirate's support for the Palestinians in Gaza who at that time were under siege by the Israeli military; when he followed that with a declaration on 6 April appointing Umalat Magomedov (also known as al-Bara) to the role of Emir of the Dagestan Front, it suggested that Muhannad had a larger profile within the Caucasus Emirate than most believed a foreign fighter could attain, and that he had the legitimate ability to influence decisions made by Umarov. On 29 August 2010, Muhannad was one of two commanders who led an assault on the village of Tsentoroy, birthplace of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov. The audacious operation was ultimately defeated after several hours of heavy fighting that resulted in the deaths of twelve militants and five security officers. Split with Dokka Umarov On 1 August 2010, the rebel website Kavkaz Center posted an announcement from Dokka Umarov in which he stated he was stepping down from the top leadership position in the Caucasus Emirate and naming Aslambek Vadalov as his replacement. However, just three days later Umarov would retract his resignation, leading to confusion over who was actually in control of the North Caucasus insurgency. On 12 August, a video posted on a Russian militant website appeared featuring Muhannad, Khuseyn Gakayev, Vadalov, and Tarkhan Gaziev; in it, the four veteran field commanders alleged that Umarov's renunciation was disrespectful to his subordinates, and while they still pledged allegiance to the Caucasus Emirate, they no longer supported him. According to Muhannad, the primary reason for the mutiny was Umarov's disobedience of the mujahideen shura council's consensus that he step down; in response, Saifullah Gubdenski - leader of the Dagestani fighters - fiercely condemned Muhannad by accusing him and his foreign predecessors of \\"neglecting the aspirations of local rebel leaders\\" and lashing out at the \\"outsiders' selfish desire to install their men in leading positions in traditionally parochial\\" Caucasian militant groups. Furthermore, the vast majority of insurgents in the republics surrounding Chechnya continued to support Umarov, at one point reaching out for external theological support via the London-based Syrian Salafi ideologue named Abd al-Mun'im Mustafa Halima (also known as Abu Basir al-Tartusi), who called on Muhannad to \\"either repent and obey Emir Doku Abu Osman (Dokka Umarov) or leave the [North] Caucasus and return home.\\" Umarov himself accused Muhannad of being the \\"main organizer of fitna (split/discord) among the Mujahideen\\" in Chechnya, and asked him to re- affirm his loyalty. When Muhannad did not, Umarov allegedly relieved him of his command, leading to a very significant break within militant ranks. Death Muhannad was killed on 21 April 2011 in a search and destroy operation carried out in forested, mountainous terrain east of the village of Serzhen-Yurt at the junction of three districts in the Chechen republic: Shali, Kurchaloi, and Vedeno. According to the press center of the Chechen Interior Ministry, the operation featured officers from several district police stations, a Spetsnaz battalion of Russian MVD ‚ÄúSouth‚Äù troops, Spetsnaz from the 2nd Patrol Regiment of the Chechen MVD, and a detachment of the ‚ÄúTerek‚Äù unit from the MVD of the North Caucasus Federal District (SKFO). The search team allegedly happened upon a group of six militants at 11:50 AM, who promptly split into groups of \\"two or three\\" so as to avoid capture. According to Russian officials, Muhannad and an Ingush militant named Ilez Sultygov ran into an ambush set by a group of commandos, and were killed in the ensuing shootout. Russian television showed footage of Muhannad's body on 22 April 2011, a common practice by Russian authorities following the successful liquidation of militant commanders. Following his death, Russian authorities stated that Muhannad was \\"directly involved in virtually every suicide terrorist attack committed in the Russian Federation over the past few years,\\" at least according to intelligence gathered from captured Chechen militants. Ramzan Kadyrov also claimed that Muhannad only weighed around 50 kilograms at the time of his death, using this as proof that the insurgency was having \\"serious difficulties with the supply of food\\" and was \\"on the verge of starvation.\\" Kadyrov, however, is known for outrageous and unverifiable claims, making it worth noting that in the photograph released of Muhannad's corpse he does not appear to be much different physically than those taken over the past decade. Muhannad's top deputy and presumed successor - an ethnic Kurd from Turkey called Abdulla Kurd - would be killed less than two weeks later, capping a momentous month for the Russian security services that included the elimination of several high-ranking Emirs in other provinces, including Supyan Abdullayev (Deputy Emir of the Caucasus Emirate), Israpil Velijanov (Emir of Vilayat Dagestan), Asker Dzhappuyev (Emir of the United Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay) and several other field commanders and lesser known Emirs of smaller sectors. Muhannad's killing was of significant importance given that he was one of the most ruthless, capable and tactically proficient field commanders as well as the last prominent Arab volunteer in Chechnya; analysts called it one of Russia's most significant security successes in the region in years. A July 2011 rapprochement by the feuding separatist factions re-aligned Gakayev, Vadalov, and numerous other field commanders who had previously forsworn their oaths of loyalty to Umarov; Muhannad's death is thought to have paved the way to reconciliation between the two sides.

Career  She began practicing Judo in PSC Glauchau/Meerane at the age of 7 years. Her first coaches were Erhard and Michael Hinke. In 1995 she went to a sport boarding school in Leipzig where she trained as part of the high performance Judo group. B√∂hm finished her Master of Sport science at the University of Leipzig in 2005. In 2007, she started to study journalism. Her coach since 1999 has been Norbert Littkopf. He was for several years also the coach of the German women's national team. Her first major success was in 1997, when she won the gold medal at the European Junior Championships in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Two years later she won the silver medal. She gained 5th place at the 2000 European Judo Championships in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland and won her first gold medal at the German National Championships. In her first World Judo Championships‚Äî2003 in Osaka, Japan‚Äîshe surprisingly won the bronze medal. This qualified her for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. In Athens she won a bronze medal in the middleweight (70 kg) division. She beat opponents Quin Dongya (China) and Catherine Roberge (Canada). In the semi-final she lost her only fight against Edith Bosch (Netherlands). After this fight, B√∂hm beat Catherine Jacques (Belgium) in only 38 seconds with an ippon-score (Te-Guruma) for a bronze medal. In 2005, B√∂hm sustained several injuries. Six weeks before the 2005 World Championships in Cairo, Egypt, she broke her left foot. Nevertheless, she battled through her injuries to narrowly miss bronze. In the following year she had several surgical procedures, which prevented her from going to the 2006 European Championships. In 2007, she qualified for the World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She only won one fight, placing her 9th place. This meant that she did not achieve direct qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. However, in 2008 she returned to her old form. She won bronze medals at the Super World Cup in Paris, France and Sofia, Bulgaria. This placed her among the top 5 on the European ranking list, which qualified her for the Olympics. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she lost the bronze medal match of the middleweight (70 kg) division to American Ronda Rousey.

The novel deals with the issue of leukoderma. A Marathi novel by Sumati Kshetramade deals with the same topic (leukoderma), and concerns a female protagonist named \\"Anupama\\". It was also adapted into a Television soap with Aishwarya Narkar playing the protagonist. Murthy says she came to know about the Marathi novel only after finishing writing her Kannada novel. Plot summary The protagonist of Mahashweta, Anupama is a Sanskrit erudite. She acts, directs and translates Sanskrit plays in her college. One day, she visits Dr. Desai, her father‚Äôs friend, hoping to sell tickets to the play she hosts for a fundraising program. There she meets Dr. Anand, an intelligent and handsome junior doctor and also a distant relative of Dr. Desai‚Äôs wife. Soon Anand‚Äôs heart is drawn towards the exquisite beauty of Anupama, who is also attracted to the handsome Anand. He half-heartedly buys the tickets from her by the persuasion of Dr. Desai, who introduces both of them to each other. Anand goes to the play titled ‚ÄòMahashweta‚Äô, which is also the name of the heroine. He is marveled by Anupama‚Äôs beauty as well as by her acting as Mahashweta. He makes up his mind to marry her. He enquires about Anupama to Shrinath, the brother- in- law of Dr. Desai. Shrinath disagrees with Anand‚Äôs idea because of the economic and social divide between him and her. Anand hails from an affluent family; his deceased father was a successful contractor. But Anupama is the daughter of a poor schoolmaster in a village and completes her higher studies surviving on scholarship. However he presents the matter to his ‚Äòpossessive noun‚Äô and ‚Äòdomineering‚Äô mother Radhakka, and she reluctantly agrees to the alliance. On realizing the impoverished state of Anupama‚Äôs household, Radhakka decides to conduct the marriage at her expense. Thus, Anupama‚Äôs life turns into a fairy tale, and she feels all her suffering has come to an end- her mother had died in her infancy, so was raised by her grandmother, and her stepmother Sabakka and her two stepsisters Nanda and Vasudha always looked down on her, because Anupama‚Äôs beauty shadowed theirs, as for Sabakka only to the motherless Anupama is she indifferent, otherwise she is compassionate to all motherless children. In spite of the love shown by Anand, she does not feel at home in his house because her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law treat her as a stranger. She feels even more desperate when Anand leaves to England for higher studies. Her discovery of the scandalous relationship of her sister-in-law, Girija also adds to the sorrow. But she adjusts. However, her life crumbles down when she discovers a white patch in her foot. It is diagnosed to be Leukoderma. But Anupama keeps it a secret. Though she takes medication for the cure, the patch keeps growing. One day, Radhakka sees Anupama leave the clinic of the dermatologist and cross-examines her. She realizes that Anupama is afflicted with leukoderma and hurls insults at her. The entire household starts to treat her worse than a servant. Radhakka sends for Anupama‚Äôs father, Shamanna and throws her out of the house in spite of his begging. Thus, Anupama returns to the village, where she faces the social stigma of a married woman living with her parents, her stepmother‚Äôs continual barbs and the ostracism that accompanies her skin condition. She is also abandoned by Anand who remains mute to her distress letters. Anand married her only for the sake of her beauty, and once it faded Anupama meant nothing to him. Shamanna gets a transfer and the family moves to another village. Three years elapse and Anupama‚Äôs condition is no better. As a last resort, she visits the village temple of which the goddess is believed to fulfill all the desires of her devotees. On the way she overhears two women talking about the marriage of Girija and the search of a new wife for Anand. Thus she contemplates suicide but becomes determined to rebuild her life against all odds. She decides to leave for Bombay where she is invited by her best friend Sumithra. There Sumithra‚Äôs husband, Hari arranges a clerical job for Anupama, and she begins to be independent and happy, also because Bombay does not remind her of Leukoderma. But life‚Äôs stock of suffering gives her one more shot. Hari who is attracted to Anupama‚Äôs beauty tries to molest her and she puts up a bold defense. After the incident, Anupama moves into the house of her colleague, Dolly and becomes a part of the family so much so that Dolly entrusts the house to Anupama when she migrates to Australia. Meanwhile, Anupama gets a job as a Sanskrit lecturer at a college. Shamanna who begs her to return to Anand dies and Sabakka demands Anupama to provide for her daughters. One day Anupama meets with a minor accident and is treated by Dr. Vasant. By his love for Sanskrit, they become friends. She also befriends Dr. Satya, the roommate, and colleague of Dr. Vasant. Anand, on the other side, leads an indecisive life; occasionally feeling sorry for Anupama and mostly approving of his decision to leave her. For him, even the sight of the parijata flower which personifies Anupama becomes frightening. But his discovery of Girija‚Äôs scandalous affair before her marriage and his mother‚Äôs support for it makes him look at Anupama from a different angle. He, thus, realizes his mistake and decides to bring her back to life. However, he fails to trace her. Anand later goes to Bombay to attend an International Medical Conference and gets invited by a friend to see a Sanskrit play. He agrees reluctantly as plays reminded him of Anupama. At the play, he realizes that it is conducted by Anupama and her students, but he fails to talk to her and manages to get her address. The next day Anupama is shocked to find Anand at the doorstep. Their conversation turns bitter as she narrates the misery she underwent and questions Anand‚Äôs actions. He begs her to forgive him and return to his life. But Anupama makes her decision clear to him: \\"How can you possibly expect a burnt seed to grow into a tree? Husband, children, affection, love...they are all irrelevant to me now (Mahashweta 148).\\" The novel ends with the planning for another drama with one of Anupama‚Äôs students, who suggests ‚ÄòMahashweta‚Äô and Anupama recites the famous lines from the play.

He is a right-handed opening batsman and very occasional right-arm medium bowler who initially played for Gauteng following his debut in 2001, and since 2004 for Lions. Personal life Cook was born in November 1982 in Johannesburg, Transvaal, son of former Test cricketer Jimmy Cook, himself an \\"exceptional opening batsman\\" with over 20,000 first-class runs. Domestic career In 2009 he scored 390 runs in a single innings, surpassing several South African and international first-class cricket records, and was included in the South Africa A squad. Cook holds the record highest score in South African first-class cricket ‚Äì 390 from 648 balls on 25 October 2009 against the Warriors ‚Äì which was also the team's first triple century. Cook had previously been a spectator to his father's own 313 and Daryll Cullinan's previous-record 337, and commented later that \\"When my brother and I used to play cricket in the garden, there was one score neither of us could ever go past and that was dad's. Neither of us could ever score more than 313.\\" Cook's score is also the twelfth-highest and fourth-longest in first-class cricket history ‚Äì taking over 14 hours to complete ‚Äì and was part of a record-breaking 365-run partnership with Thami Tsolekile, also a record for South African first-class cricket. In June 2018, Cook stepped down as the captain of Lions, after being in charge of the team for three seasons. International career On 18 January 2016 he was added to South Africa's Test squad, and became the 6th South African (and 102nd Test player) to score a century on debut coincidentally at Centurion Park, which was a historical moment, during the first day of the fourth Test against England. Cook was the first South African to face the pink ball as well as the first ever delivery in a day-night Test match and co-incidentally his father Jimmy Cook was also the first ever South African to have faced the white ball in an ODI. Cook is the first ever batsman to score a test century in the 3rd innings of a Day/Night test match, when he scored 104 in that innings. His 104 is still the highest individual score for any batsman in the 3rd innings of a day-night test match.

He also played for Bury, Bradford City, Huddersfield Town, Bournemouth and Colchester United between 1961 and 1974. Career Born in Prestbury, Aimson began his career with Manchester City, making his debut at centre-half at the age of 18 against Blackburn Rovers. The game ended in a 4‚Äì1 defeat for City on 9 December 1961. He retrained as a striker over the course of the next year, and in the 1963‚Äì64 season scored six goals in 17 appearances in all competitions. He signed for York City in 1964 for a ¬£1,000 fee, scoring 26 goals in his first season, helping the club win promotion to the Third Division.

It was promoted by Angelo Savoldi and his sons Mario, Tom, and Joseph Savoldi. An \\"outlaw\\" wrestling promotion in the 1980s, International World Class Championship Wrestling held interpromotional events with the Puerto Rican- based World Wrestling Council, the American Wrestling Association and World Class Championship Wrestling. Many of its former roster would later find success in the World Wrestling Federation, World Championship Wrestling, Extreme Championship Wrestling and elsewhere during the 1990s. History=ICW: 1984-1991  Originally known as International Championship Wrestling (not to be confused with the similarly named ICW promotion run by Angelo Poffo between 1978 and 1984), the promotion started holding events the Boston area sometime around 1984 or 1985. Initially ICW was affiliated with the Puerto Rico-based World Wrestling Council, recognizing the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship and the WWC Tag Team Championship as the top championships in the promotion. The titles were never clearly named as ‚ÄúWWC‚Äù titles on ICW television, nor were they presented as being owned by ICW. On February 27, 1985, Dory Funk, Jr. defeated Carlos Col√≥n for the WWC Universal Heavyweight Title in Bangor, Maine. It marked the first time that the WWC Universal Title changed hands outside of Puerto Rico. During the time WWC and ICW had a working relationship talent from both federations travelled to the other federation to compete. The working relationship brought such superstars as Abdullah the Butcher, the Invaders and Hercules Ayala to the New England Area. Angelo Savoldi‚Äôs grandson ‚ÄùJumping‚Äù Joe Savoldi won the WWC Tag-Team Championship alongside Al Perez (known as the New York Rockers) on January 6, 1985 when they beat Super Medico I and Black Gorman. Sometime in 1985 the working relation between ICW and WWC ended, which led to ICW creating both a Heavyweight and a tag-team title with their own names on them in 1985-86. ICW next worked out another working relationship with Championship Wrestling from Florida which saw several Florida stars come to ICW such as Kevin Sullivan (who also acted as a booker for ICW) as well as top stars Blackjack Mulligan, Mark Lewin, Austin Idol and The Russian Brute, George Petraski and Bruiser Brody. ICW also had a history of working with the American Wrestling Association, promoting joint cards in New England as well as AWA talent appearing on ICW shows from time to time. The ICW would expand beyond New England and produced cards in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York State. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, ICW cards occurred in towns like Harrisburgh, Middletown and Monticello, NY. This model was differentiated ICW from other regional federations, in that ICW was a very large territory that didn't have one town or city to act as its local base. So while the company had a presence in a wide area, it never got that strong local following of World Class, the PNW or the USWA. Over the years ICW established a kind of ‚Äúopen door‚Äù policy, working with any federation or any individual competitor who was interested in working in the federation; this open door policy even saw the Japanese Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling Brass Knuckles Champion Atsushi Onita challenge the ICW Heavyweight champion Tony Atlas to a Title Vs Title Match. Onita lost the match by Disqualification to keep the titles separate. Around 1989-90 ICW began using more ‚Äúkid oriented‚Äù gimmicks like ‚ÄúSuper Duper Mario‚Äù (a wrestling version of Super Mario) as well as Curly Moe, the Equalizers: Zip, Zap and Zoom and even had a ‚ÄúTeen Report‚Äù segment hosted by kids. Paul E. Dangerously, after being fired from WCW, went to work for the company as a writer, but was fired on his first day in the middle of his first TV taping.Wrestling Observer Newsletter: 11/27/89 IWCCW: 1991-1995  In 1991, the promotion entered into a working agreement with Kevin Von Erich to use the World Class Championship Wrestling name. Von Erich had sold the WCCW territory to Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler in 1989 but retained the rights to the World Class name (which is why Jarrett and Lawler created the United States Wrestling Association). Since there was no real ‚Äúhome promotion‚Äù of WCCW the ‚Äúmerger‚Äù was only really felt in ICW and mainly as a way to re-brand the federation so that it did not have the same name as Angelo Poffo‚Äôs old ICW territory. Due to this working agreement, ICW changed the name of the promotion to International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW), using the same opening sequence as WCCW did in the 1980s, with Earth from the Apollo 16 mission in the background. Kevin Von Erich had won the WCCW Texas Title and appeared in several promos with the belt to announce the merger of the two federations. Kevin was billed as the ‚ÄúWorld Class‚Äù champion. The idea was that down the road the two champions (Tony Atlas and Kevin Von Erich) would meet to create an IWCCW title. Kevin appeared a couple of times in New England, wrestling at 2 or 3 TV tapings. He participated in a memorable interview with wrestler Tony Rumble, aka The Boston Bad Boy. During that interview, Rumble berated the Von Erichs, and Kevin in return ran Rumble out of the studio when he signalled for the iron claw. Another World Class mainstay, Chris Adams, was to have been a part of IWCCW, but was not able to join the federation due to his legal troubles. After a short while Kevin Von Erich returned to Texas, effectively ending any plans to merge the two titles, but the name was kept. The IWCCW name lasted until the promotion closed down in 1995. A video series, All Star American Wrestling' was released during 1992 and 1993 which featured matches from IWCCW. In early 1993 however, many of its longtime veterans left the promotion to join the newly formed Century Wrestling Alliance (the present day NWA Cold Front) promoted by former manager and booker Tony Rumble. Among those jumping to Rumble's promotion included then Heavyweight Champion Tony Atlas, Light heavyweight champion Joe Savoldi and Tag Team champions the Billion Dollar Babies, leaving many of its titles vacant. IWCCW began to decline as its events were held irregularly throughout 1994 and early 1995. Despite a short lived revival in 1995 that saw former WWF stars such as Tito Santana and Koko B. Ware hold the IWCCW title, the promotion folded in the latter part of 1995. Mario Savoldi kept promoting cards in the New England area after the demise of ICW/IWCCW. In 1999 Savoldi was involved in a promotion called Ultimate Professional Wrestling (not to be mistaken for Ultimate Pro Wrestling) which continued IWCCW‚Äôs tradition of mixing current wrestling with classic matches on their TV shows. UPW's website claims to be a direct continuation of ICW. Television Despite being a small promotion that mainly toured in the New England area ICW/IWCCW had a nationally syndicated show from its inception. The show, simply called International Championship Wrestling was even seen on Satellite channels in the United Kingdom. The ICW shows usually featured a combination of original ICW/IWCCW footage and repeats of footage from other territories such as WWC, Florida Wrestling, Memphis, the National Wrestling Alliance and vintage footage of the World Wrestling Federation. From around 1990 and on ICW Television often repeated old ICW matches, sometimes presenting them as brand new, other times repeating the same match for weeks in a row ‚Äì Vic Steamboat‚Äôs title victory over Tony Atlas and Joe Savoldi beating the Tasmaniac for the IWCCW Lightheavyweight title were two of the matches that were shown repeatedly. IWCCW‚Äôs ‚ÄúRevolving door‚Äù policy often meant that events would be hyped on Television but never actually happened in real life, the best example of this was an angle between ‚ÄùRavishing‚Äù Rick Rude and The Honky Tonk Man over who was the best Intercontinental Champion of all time. Vignettes were aired for months on end but neither Rude nor the Honky Tonk Man ever worked in an ICW ring to settle the issue. In addition to its television series, IWCCW owns the rights to WCCW footage produced following its buyout by promoter Jerry Jarrett in 1988 and includes the video libraries of USWA Dallas, Wild West Wrestling and the Global Wrestling Federation, and IWCCW remains one of the few North American regional promotions whose collection is not owned by the World Wrestling Entertainment video library. During the late 1990s, the Savoldi family released several low cost DVD series including Classic Superstars of Wrestling which includes early matches from Steve Austin, Mick Foley and Booker T. Stars of the future IWCCW gave many future superstars their first breaks in wrestling and their first television exposure. The federation was in many ways the breeding ground for future Eastern Championship Wrestling (later ‚ÄúExtreme Championship Wrestling‚Äù) performers due to the fact that Paul Heyman worked for the company as head booker Williams, Scott E. Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of the ECW. Champaign, Illinois: Sports Publishing L.L.C., 2006. in late 1989 and early 1990 and got to know quite a few of the people involved, such as Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge who both competed in IWCCW under different gimmicks. Rocco Rock was a masked high flier known as ‚ÄúThe Cheetah Kid‚Äù while Johnny Grunge worked both as ‚ÄúJohnny Rotten‚Äù and ‚ÄúEqualizer Zap‚Äù. Heyman would repackage both men as The Public Enemy. Peter Senerchia, a former IWCCW Light Heavyweight Champion who had been wrestling in the promotion as The Tasmaniac, agreed to appear at an IWCCW taping in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1990. However, after a disagreement between him and promoters Mario and Tom Savoldi, he left the promotion and eventually began competing in Eastern Championship Wrestling during the early 1990s.Loverro, Thom.

According to Dreamer (interviewed in WWE Magazine), he delivered some food to a person's house, who just so happened to be watching Dreamer win the IWCCW title on TV at the same time.

There was a controversy over implementation of the Act on private toll operators and private toll roads and bridges but the controversy was settled in 2003 when on a case taken up by him, the Indian Ministry of Road Transport & Highways clarified that the Act was valid even for the present times and toll exemption was to be granted to both 'on duty' and 'off duty' defence personnel. Toll tax exemption to defence personnel was later challenged in the Punjab & Haryana High Court by way of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) but the petition was dismissed by the Court which upheld the exemption. The Indian Tolls (Army & Air Force) Act, 1901 was then challenged in the Supreme Court of India but the petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court too, thus upholding the provisions of the Act which provides a very special privilege to the military community.http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=207677Supreme Court upholds 105-year-old law He is also credited with effective implementation of entertainment tax exemption to serving defence personnel in cinemas and theatres.

Walter was duly elected as the first mayor of Stratford District Council, a position he held for three terms (nine years) until retiring in 1998.Walter, David (2005), Stratford: Shakespearean Town Under the Mountain. Dunmore Publishing, Wellington, New Zealand He reportedly originated the colloquial name for State Highway 43: the Forgotten World Highway. After 15 years at the helm of local government and 24 years on County and District Councils, Walter moved on from territorial politics to become a Taranaki Regional Councillor. In November 2001 he replaced inaugural chairman Ross Allen and retired in 2007. Walter has also played significant roles in a number of other organisations. He chaired the TSB Community Trust, served as a director of TSB Bank, and represented the Regional Council on the board of Westgate Transport Ltd.Taranaki Regional Council Newsletter: November 2001 No. 36 Honours and awards In 1990, Walter was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1995 Queen's Birthday Honours, Walter was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services.

It can be due to interaction between electrostatic fields and net charge or electric polarization effects. The beam-like structure/element is generally cantilevered (fix at one of its ends). In nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are typical ones for electrostatic deflections. Image:Electric deflection CNT.JPG Mechanisms of electric deflection due to electric polarization can be understood as follows: Image:Electric polarization effect.jpg As shown in Fig.2, when a material is brought into an electric field (E), the field tends to shift the positive charge (in red) and the negative charge (in blue) in opposite directions. Thus, induced dipoles are created. Fig. 3 shows a beam-like structure/element in an electric field. The interaction between the molecular dipole moment and the electric field results an induced torque (T). Then this torque tends to align the beam toward the direction of field. Image:Electric induced torque.jpg In case of a cantilevered CNT (Fig. 1), it would be bent to the field direction. Meanwhile the electrically induced torque and stiffness of the CNT compete against each other. This deformation has been observed in experiments.Poncharal Science 283, 1513 (1999)Wei APL 79, 4527 (2001) This property is an important characteristic for CNTs promising nanoelectromechanical systems applications, as well as for their fabrication, separation and electromanipulation.

Techniques of multivariate statistics are used. Companies that use multivariate testing include Optimizely (for landing page optimization), Mailchimp (for email), and Marpipe (for ad creative). In internet marketing In internet marketing, multivariate testing is a process by which more than one component of a website may be tested in a live environment. It can be thought of in simple terms as numerous A/B tests performed on one page at the same time. A/B tests are usually performed to determine the better of two content variations; multivariate testing uses multiple variables to find the ideal combination.https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/glossary/multivariate- testing/ The only limits on the number of combinations and the number of variables in a multivariate test are the amount of time it will take to get a statistically valid sample of visitors and computational power. Multivariate testing is usually employed in order to ascertain which content or creative variation produces the best improvement in the defined goals of a website, whether that be user registrations or successful completion of a checkout process (that is, conversion rate). Dramatic increases can be seen through testing different copy text, form layouts and even landing page images and background colours. However, not all elements produce the same increase in conversions, and by looking at the results from different tests, it is possible to identify those elements that consistently tend to produce the greatest increase in conversions.WilsonWeb.com, Conversion/Testing: 10 Factors to Test that Could Increase the Conversion Rate of your Landing Pages, by Sumantra Roy, 06/05/2007 Testing can be carried out on a dynamically generated website by setting up the server to display the different variations of content in equal proportions to incoming visitors. Statistics on how each visitor went on to behave after seeing the content under test must then be gathered and presented. Outsourced services can also be used to provide multivariate testing on websites with minor changes to page coding. These services insert their content to predefined areas of a site and monitor user behavior. In a nutshell, multivariate testing can be seen as allowing website visitors to vote with their clicks for which content they prefer and will stand the most chance of their proceeding to a defined goal. The testing is transparent to the visitor with all commercial solutions capable of ensuring that each visitor is shown the same content on every visit. Some websites benefit from constant 24/7 continuous optimization as visitor response to creatives and layouts differ by time of day/week or even season. Multivariate testing is currently an area of high growth in internet marketing as it helps website owners to ensure that they are getting the most from the visitors arriving at their site. Areas such as search engine optimization and pay per click advertising bring visitors to a site and have been extensively used by many organisations but multivariate testing allows internet marketeers to ensure that visitors are being shown the right offers, content and layout to convert them to sale, registration or the desired action once they arrive at the website. There are two principal approaches used to achieve multivariate testing on websites. One being Page Tagging; a process where the website creator inserts JavaScript into the site to inject content variants and monitor visitor response. Page tagging typically tracks what a visitor viewed on the website and for how long that visitor remained on the site together with any click or conversion related actions performed. Page tagging is often done by a technical team rather than the online marketer who designs the test and interprets the results in the light of usability analysis. \\"Web Analytics Demystified\\", \\"Web Analytics and Data Collection: The Page Tag\\", By Judah Phillips Later refinements on this method allow for a single common tag to be deployed across all pages, reducing deployment time and removing the need for re-deployment between tests. The second principal approach used does not require page tagging. By establishing a DNS-proxy or hosting within a website's own datacenter, it is possible to intercept and process all web traffic to and from the site undergoing testing, insert variants and monitor visitor response. In this case, all logic sits on the server rather than browser-side, and after initial DNS changes are made, no further technical involvement is required from the website point of view. SiteSpect is known to employ this method of implementation. Multivariate testing can also be applied to email body content and mobile web pages. In addition to testing the efficacy of various creative/content executions on a website, the principles of multivariate testing can and often are used to test various offer combinations. Examples of this are testing various price points, purchase incentives, premiums, trial periods or other similar purchase incentives both individually and in combination with each other. The value of this is that marketers (both traditional and online) can use multivariate testing principles online to quickly ascertain and predict the effectiveness of offers without going through the more traditional multivariate testing methods which take significantly more time and money (focus groups, telephone surveys, etc.).  Design of experiments  Statistical testing relies on design of experiments. Several methods in use for multivariate testing include: #Full factorial the most straightforward method whereby all possible combinations of content variants are served with equal probability. #Discrete choice and what has mutated to become choice modeling is the complex technique that won Daniel McFadden the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2000. Choice modeling models how people make tradeoffs in the context of a purchase decision. By systematically varying the attributes or content elements, one can quantify their impact on outcome, such as a purchase decision. What is most important are the interaction effects uncovered, which neither the Taguchi methods nor optimal design discern.MarketingNPV, 3 Ways to Accelerate Your Learning Process #Optimal design involves iterations and waves of testings. Optimal design allows marketers the ability not only to test the maximum number of creative permutations in the shortest period of time but also to take into account relationships, interactions, and constraints across content elements on a website. This allows one to find the optimal solution unencumbered by limitations. #Taguchi methods: with multiple variations of content in multiple locations on a website, a large number of combinations need to be tested, and medium/low traffic websites can take a long time to get a large enough sample to find statistically significant differences in performance if differences really exist. For example, if three different images are to be tested in each of three locations, there are nine combinations to test. Taguchi methods (namely Taguchi orthogonal arrays) can be used in the design of experiments in order to reduce the variations but still give statistically valid results on individual content elements.Webpronews.com, Scientific Web Site Optimization using AB Split Testing, Multi Variable Testing, and The Taguchi Method, by Matthew Roche, 07/26/2004 Taguchi uses fractional factorial designs.

In the early 1970s, while working in a shipyard, he raffled his first pay cheque, selling tickets to workmates and earning well above the value of his wage. By 20 he was married and a father to two girls and, although he had left school early, Griffiths was determined to have an education. He entered university on a scholarship and worked as a taxi driver to support his family while he studied. Griffiths graduated from Monash University in 1979 with a Bachelor of Economics and a Bachelor of Laws.In the news and on the move, Monash University, August 1996 Griffiths' first contact with politics came in the early 1980s, when he worked in the office of former New South Wales Premier, Neville Wran, before being elected to the Federal seat of Maribyrnong in 1983. Political career=Ministries held Entering the parliament in 1983, Griffiths became the Minister for Resources in 1990, the Minister for Tourism in 1991 and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development in 1993. It was reported that in just two years in the Resources portfolio, Griffiths \\"pushed through reforms in a staggering number of areas. Resource rent taxes, expanded offshore oil exploration, quarantine and inspection, food quality, national power supply policies and forest development are but a few of the reforms\\". Griffiths was also quoted as favouring \\"sensible economic development\\" and saying that Australia \\"needs a development ethic\\". During his time in the Tourism portfolio, Griffiths urged more private investment in tourism infrastructure if Australia was to grow as a major tourist destination.P. Skeggs, \\"Rooms Key to Tourism Boom\\", Herald Sun, 10 June 1992 He said the Australian Tourist Commission would focus on promoting Australia as a destination for travelers with special interests in sport, the environment, culture, arts, food and wine and that the Commonwealth Department of Tourism was examining ways to give tourists more opportunities to enjoy Aboriginal culture. At the time of his appointment to the Industry portfolio, Griffiths was described as \\"the big winner out of Paul Keating's ministerial reshuffle\\". While in this portfolio, the development of Australia's regional areas was a key focus, including the establishment of the Task Force on Regional Development, which visited 60 regions across Australia to hear community ideas for local development.\\"Locals given a say\\", Herald Sun, 21 December 1993 The Task Force, which was instructed to examine the differing effects of industry and economic structural change between regions, was led by the then ACTU Secretary, Bill Kelty and reported back to Griffiths in December 1993. Committee Service Griffiths was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges from 1983 to 1984, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee from 1987 to 1990 and the Industry, Science and Technology Committee from 1994 to 1996.

Griffiths told the media at the time that anecdotal evidence suggested there was a wide spectrum of involvement in areas of insider trading in the business community and it was therefore incumbent upon governments to ensure they took whatever steps were available to prevent that sort of business behavior.7.30 Report, ABC Television, 9 February 1989 Griffiths also chaired a Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into progress made towards the achievement of equal opportunity and equal status for Australian women, to mark the fifth anniversary of the enactment of the Sex Discrimination Act in Australia. Griffiths said at the outset of the inquiry that \\"anyone who takes seriously the issue of the status of women and opportunities for women in Australian society, will concede readily that vis- a-vis the male of the species, they are, in most areas, at something of a disadvantage. It's a moot point of course, the extent to which legislation can change the objective circumstances and the subtle forms of discrimination that they face, but certainly very few people with an interest in the area would argue that you shouldn't have things like sex discrimination legislation and affirmative action legislation\\".\\"Ring the Bells\\", ABC Television, 4 August 1989 Griffiths went on to say that while more opportunities were opening up for women, the inquiry wanted to find ways \\"to ensure that the Parliament has an ongoing role in trying to bring about...the impetus for change\\".

But he had waited for \\"total vindication\\" before declaring his resignation. \\"I am in the happy situation of being totally vindicated,\\" he told the media at the time. \\"I spoke to the Prime Minister this morning who I might say tried to talk me out of announcing my resignation and who confirmed his previous public commitment that I would return to the Cabinet as soon as possible. But there is life after politics, and I intend to pursue life after politics.\\" In a statement, then prime minister Paul Keating praised Griffiths' contribution to the parliament and the cabinet from the time of his election in 1983. \\"It has always been my expectation and hope that the current inquiry into those matters will clear Alan Griffiths of any wrongdoing,\\" Keating said. \\"Alan Griffiths would have had sufficient support among his parliamentary colleagues to return to the ministry in due course. I would certainly have welcomed his return to Cabinet.\\" At the time, Codd had offered to give the prime minister an interim report which could have cleared the way for Griffiths to make an early return to the Cabinet. But the prime minister declined, preferring to await the final report which would take several more months. After politics=Quantm After leaving politics, Griffiths founded a technology company, Quantm, based on an advanced computer program developed by CSIROJohn McBeth, \\"Quantum's (sic) Leap to Riches\\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 19 September 2002 The technology generated huge savings on Australasian, US and Chinese infrastructure projects, according to a report in the respected regional journal The Far Eastern Economic review.

It automates the process through which roads are designed and costed and presents the planner with a range of options. Griffiths, the majority owner and founder of Quantm, and the Quantm board in 2006 agreed to sell the company to an arm of a U.S. construction conglomerate, Trimble Navigation Ltd, for what was believed to be a multi-million dollar price tag to pursue other entrepreneurial business ventures, including a United Kingdom-based high technology business.Reuters Significant Developments, \\"Trimble Navigation Limited acquires Quantm\\", 6 April 2006; interview Alan Griffiths, 20 September 2011 In early 2006, Quantm, as a leader in transport route optimisation, was selected by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program ‚Äì Transportation Research Board as one of eight technologies enabling highway and railroad planners to successfully factor in environmental concerns in transportation decisionsENP Newswire, \\"Quantm Honored by Transportation Research Board as Key Pro- Environment Technology\\", 26 January 2006 Quantm, which by 2006 was already being used by 14 U.S. states, was chosen from a field of 70 technologies for the prestigious award Shopitize Since 2010, Griffiths has been Executive Chairman of Shopitize based in the UK.

Formation After the success of 1st Ranger Battalion in the North Africa campaign, the Army saw the merit in small special operations units. Portions of 1st Ranger Battalion was split into 2nd, 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions. The battalion was formed from American volunteers in North Africa.Cawthorne, Nigel, The Mammoth Book of Inside the Elite Forces, Robinson, 2008 Training Much like their predecessor, 4th Ranger Battalion had a strict training regimen, directed by William Orlando Darby. 3rd and 4th Battalions trained alongside each other, with members of 1st Battalion acting as training cadre. Passing along the lessons taught by the British 3 Commando Brigade, the Rangers engaged in rough training, including live-fire exercises (an uncommon practice at the time). Major Roy Murray took command of the Rangers as they prepared for their first mission. Combat On 10 July 1943, 4th Battalion, along with 1st and 3rd spearheaded Seventh Army's Amphibious Battle of Gela and Licata, beginning the Allied invasion of Sicily. Arriving ahead of the 1st Infantry Division, the Rangers quickly encountered the Italian 4th \\"Livorno\\" Division and the Hermann Goering Division. Facing an overwhelming surprise attack, the Livorno Division surrendered. The Hermann Goering Division was pushed back into the city of Messina where it held off the Allied forces for the remaining German forces to escape. The Battalion suffered heavy casualties during the Battle of Cisterna and it; along with the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalion, were virtually destroyed and were subsequently disbanded.Cawthorne, Nigel, The Mammoth Book of Inside the Elite Forces, Robinson, 2008 See also *United States Army Rangers References *Lock, John D. and Moore, Harold G.

Career Born in East Kilbride, McGinty came through the youth system at Rangers. He made his Premier Division debut in January 1995 against Partick Thistle but only made a further three appearances in as many seasons. Former Rangers striker Mark Hateley signed McGinty for Hull City in November 1997 and he played over fifty games for the club before leaving for Conference side Scarborough on a short-term deal in August 1999. McGinty returned to Scotland for a spell at Airdrie but moved on to Irish League side Portadown where he broke his leg in April 2000. On his recovery, McGinty played one match for Dumbarton in August 2000 but he signed for Cumnock Juniors later that month. McGinty stepped back up to senior football when Tom Hendrie signed him for St Mirren in November 2001. In spite of injury problems which included a Bell's palsy affliction in 2002‚Äì03, he appeared 137 times in all competitions for the Paisley side before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in April 2007. McGinty dropped back to the Junior grade with Irvine Meadow in the summer of 2007. In a successful period for the Ayrshire side, he won league titles in 2009 and 2011 and was part of the first Junior side to face an SPL side in the Scottish Cup when Meadow reached the fourth round in 2009‚Äì10.

It has been said the book is a love letter to the people of Te Tii, the Northland town where he was living at that time. An Explanation of Poetry to My Father was published and written in 2001. Written in the middle of his work on Playing God, the book was a distraction for Colquhoun from that work. The poems are an explanation of why the son of a builder would go and write poetry. Playing God, Colquhuoun‚Äôs third book, was published in 2002 to critical acclaim and popular support. It has sold over 10,000 copies in New Zealand and in 2007 was published in the UK.

McDuff (voice provided by Jack Lester) could talk not only to the other animals, but also to Dr. Campbell.

The design centred on the idea of being an improved version of William Stroudley's D1 tanks, the D3 intending to be replace the D1s on certain duties. The design shared spare parts with Billinton's other designs, the cylinder's design being shared with the C2 goods engines, the boilers with the E4 radial tanks. Their first employment was services radiating around Tunbridge Wells and outer-suburban work into London. One locomotive, number 363, was named after the company's chairman, Sir Julian Goldsmid, who was so fond of the engine he had an image of the locomotive used on the railway's cap badges. Another locomotive, No. 375 Glynde, was used to haul an armoured train for the 1st Sussex Volunteers for two years from 1896. The class, along with other Billinton and Stroudley engines, were reboilered. Two were rebuilt as class D3x with larger boilers, but this proved to be ineffective, and smaller boilers were used on the rest, which remained as class D3. After the First World War, the class were increasing more at the countryside end of the system in their operating scope. Southern Railway The locomotives passed to the Southern Railway (SR) in 1923. They were soon seeing new changes, as 10 members of the class were moved to London Bridge to act as carriage shunters, while from 1931 the repairs and overhauls of the class were undertaken at Ashford works rather than at Brighton, after the latter works was mothballed. Electrification and the transfer of locomotives from other areas were the first real threats towards the class's survival, some spending time in store, and the first withdrawals taking place from 1933. However, they were fitted for working motor trains (otherwise known as Push-pull trains) by the Southern during the 1930s to replace D1 tanks, although the D3 were considered rougher riding. World War Two: Luftwaffe versus D3 During World War II, on 26 November 1942, one engine, number 2365, was working an afternoon New Romney to Ashford passenger train through the Romney Marshes near Lydd when she was attacked by a low-flying German fighter aircraft. Cannon fire from the plane caused the dome on the top of the engine's boiler to burst, but no railway staff or passengers were hurt. Either by actual contact as he misjudged his dive, or in the sudden uprush of steam from the boiler, the pilot lost control of his plane and, as it crashed, he was flung out and drowned in a dyke. The engine was reboilered and returned to service on the New Romney branch early the following year. Other members of the class which had been stored before the war found themselves being pressed back into service; when fears for an invasion were at their worst, this led to some being moved away to other places, including Salisbury. British Railways Twenty-eight locomotives passed to British Railways in 1948, and they were numbered 32364-32398 (with gaps). Although still working motor trains successfully, the class in general were becoming worn out. The D3s were replaced by former South Eastern H class and London & South Western M7 class tanks engines during the early 1950s. Most were withdrawn by 1953, but one, 32390, remained in traffic for two more years until being cut up at Brighton Works in 1955. During those two years she was used to cover for failing M7s from Tunbridge Wells, or for special railtours. Her last days were spent working from Brighton on services to Horsham. None of the engines has survived into preservation. Accidents and Incidents Sometime before being withdrawn in 1955, No. 2390, formerly named St. Leonards, crashed through the shed wall.

Youth Ruth Blaney was raised in Irving, Kansas in Marshall County by parents William T. and Lillian F. Blaney. Ruth had a natural interest in mechanics and assisted her father who ran a hardware store. Her first flight in an airplane occurred on July 4, 1920 when she took a ride with a local barnstormer at the age of 15.Blaney, W.T. ‚ÄúCloud Hopper: No. 3. Clipped Wings‚Äù San Diego Sun, July 9, 1930. Searching for her career path, she worked at a general store and at a beauty parlor near Kansas City. She married briefly in 1925 but the marriage was annulled soon afterwards. On June 16, 1925 she married Mac P. Alexander, a farmer from Olathe, Kansas. They lived together for two years but separated due to irreconcilable differences. In roughly 1927, Ruth fell from a horse, breaking her shoulder, several ribs, and several fingers. During her recovery she nearly died from pneumonia but surprised her doctors by making a full recovery. After this, she divorced Mac Alexander, and move to San Diego, California in order to pursue aviation. At the time, San Diego, California went by the nickname ‚ÄúAir Capital of the West.‚ÄùAlexander, Ruth, ‚ÄúCloud Hopper: No. 4: Ambition,‚Äù San Diego Sun, July 10, 1930. Flight School Arriving in San Diego, Ruth worked as a beautician to save up sufficient funds for flight school. However, at precisely the same time, the editor of the local San Diego Sun newspaper announced a contest to encourage women‚Äôs participation in aviation ‚Äì the winner of the ‚ÄúMiss Air Capital of the West‚Äù contest would receive a free full course of instruction at the Ryan Flying School (a cost of $1375, roughly $20,000 in 2019 dollars).Alexander, Ruth ‚ÄúCloud Hopper: No. 5: Opportunity, San Diego Sun, July 11, 1930. Ruth entered the contest along with approximately 60 other women and was one of the ten finalist, but did not finish in the top three. A 19-year-old San Diegan named Peaches Wallace placed first. However, Ruth was undaunted and took stock of her assets and determined that she had sacrificed and saved enough nickels and dimes to pay for her tuition and enrolled at the Ryan Flying School. These activities were reported regularly in the San Diego Sun. Ruth‚Äôs instruction began on September 9, 1929 at Ryan Field (Dutch Flats), the same airport from which Charles Lindbergh had used to start his journey in the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927. Ruth made her first solo flight on October 25, 1929 and completed her training on November 11, 1929, the first Kansasan to graduate from the Ryan school. On November 17, 1929 she became the 65th licensed woman pilot in the U.S., also attaining her FAI license the same day.Alexander, Ruth ‚ÄúCloud Hopper: No. 6: First Chance‚Äù San Diego Sun, July 12, 1930. World Record for Altitude Less than 24 hours after attaining her license, Alexander took off from Ryan Field on November 18, 1929, in a Great Lakes biplane and continued climbing to what she believed was an altitude of better than 18,000 feet over the skies of San Diego. This was later recognized as a new official world record altitude for women in light planes of 15,718 feet, generating considerable notoriety not only for herself but San Diego and the Ryan Flying School. She was hailed as a local hero and given a special banquet by the San Diego Chamber of Commerce on November 22, 1929 and met with Mayor Harry C. Clark.‚ÄùCoronado Girl Passes Rigid F.A.I.

In December, she was flown on a special flight to Oakland, California for a special lunch in her honor with Amelia Earhart. After the lunch, Ruth was flown in a Ford Trimotor around the Bay area and offered the chance to pilot the aircraft, reportedly becoming the third woman in the US to have done so.Alexander, Ruth ‚ÄúCloud Hopper: No. 7: Fledgling, San Diego Sun, July 14, 1930. Gliding After witnessing the gliding instruction of William Hawley Bowlus at Lindbergh Field in primary gliders,Irving Leader, January 17, 1930. Ruth expressed an interest in becoming the first woman in the U.S. to earn a glider license. However, shortly thereafter, Anne Morrow Lindbergh visited San Diego and took instruction from Bowlus, becoming the first woman to receive a first-class glider license in the U.S. On February 16, 1930, Ruth Alexander qualified for a United States second-class glider license from the slopes of Mount Soledad, near La Jolla, California. In doing so she followed Anne Morrow Lindbergh as the second woman in the United States to achieve this distinction. Alexander made a perfect flight using a primary glider lasting 2 minutes 33 and 2/5 seconds.San Diego Sun, February 17, 1930. In the spring of 1930, she became a glider instructor and, in so doing, became the first woman in the United States to hold this position. She was a charter member of the Anne Lindbergh Gliders Club of San Diego and joined the Ninety-Nines organization of women pilots. Commercial Pilot‚Äôs License In March of 1930, Ruth was granted a commercial pilot‚Äôs license. Given Ruth‚Äôs growing national fame, a contingent from Kansas travelled to California to meet her including Kansas Governor Clyde M. Reed, other politicians, Fred Trigg the editor of the Kansas City Star, and others. Ruth‚Äôs first official passenger was Governor Reed on a flight from Ryan Field.San Diego Evening Tribune, March 13, 1930. Another World Record for Altitude On July 4, 1930, Ruth Alexander flew a Nicholas- Beazley NB-3 (Barling NB-3) light aircraft (serial number 52, U.S. Department of Commerce registration number 880M) to 21,000 feet; this was not confirmed as an official record owing to problems with the official barograph. Her altitude had exceeded the rating for the barograph drum.San Diego Union, July 4, 1930.San Diego Union, July 5, 1930. On July 11, 1930, Alexander took off at 1:34 p.m. in the same Barling from Lindbergh Field. After briefly losing consciousness at extreme altitudes despite using an oxygen tube, she established a new world record in light planes (for both men and women) of 26,600 feet at the apex of the flight.San Diego Union, July 11, 1930.San Diego Sun, July 12, 1930.\\"Girl Flies Up 20,000 Feet,\\" The Irving Leader, July 11, 1930. The American record held prior to this flight was set by D. S. Zimmerly (male) at an altitude of 24,074 feet over St. Louis, Missouri on February 16, 1930. Later in July, Ruth became the first woman in the US to become an air deputy.‚ÄúRuth Alexander is First Woman Air Deputy in U.S.,‚Äù San Diego Sun, July 30, 1930. Three Flags Flights In July of 1930, Ruth proposed to fly from Mexico to Canada via the U.S. ‚Äì a ‚Äúthree flags flight‚Äù along the west coast air route. Tex Rankin had established a speed record over this route and Ruth wished to exceed it. In addition, Ruth looked to become the first woman to make a round trip flight from Canada to Mexico, and the first woman to fly from Canada to Mexico non-stop. Her northbound route started on August 27, 1930 from Agua Caliente, Tijuana, Mexico to San Diego and then Los Angeles. On August 28 she continued from Los Angeles to Oakland, then Portland. And on August 29, she completed the northbound leg to Seattle before finally landing at Vancouver (Lulu Island). The return leg on August 31 started at roughly 3:20 a.m. from Vancouver and concluded back at Agua Caliente at 7:15 p.m. for a total flight time of 15 hours, 54 minutes, 30 seconds. The 1,460 mile journey was flown at an average speed of 91.25 mph which was the fastest time by a woman on the route but not faster than Rankin‚Äôs prior 14 hours and 37 minutes. The flight earned NAA records for distance over a specified air route by a woman, and a speed record over the course by a woman.San Diego Union, August 31, 1930.San Diego Union, Sept 2, 1930. Journey Home In September, 1930 Ruth wrote to her parents in Irving that she was planning to fly from San Diego to Wichita, Kansas, continuing from there to New York City, with return stops at various cities on the east coast before returning to San Diego in October. Arrangements were made for her to meet the Lindberghs and the Mayor of New York upon her arrival. Given the flight was sponsored by the Agua Caliente Company, the flight originated at the Agua Caliente Race Track before continuing to Lindbergh Field and then east to Wichita. Her takeoff from Agua Caliente at 1:05 a.m. on September 18, 1930 was uneventful, leading to a landing at Lindbergh Field shortly thereafter. Topped off with fuel, she once again took off at 3:28 a.m. from Lindbergh Field but instead of completing her cross-country journey she entered low clouds and fog, is believed to have tip stalled, and crashed at Plumosa Park in Loma Portal, San Diego just west of the airport.San Diego Union, September 18, 1930.Oakland Tribune, September 18, 1930.Los Angeles Times, September 18, 1930. The crash was at such a high rate of speed that she died instantly upon impact.

He was a national champion, a three-time Olympian and an Australian representative at five World Rowing Championships. He won a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in the men's eight. Early life and studies Fernandez was born in Melbourne. He grew up in the remote mining town of Gove, Northern Territory, but moved to Adelaide for high school, where he attended Christian Brothers College. His main sporting interest at the time was Australian Rules Football, but he was required to participate in a summer sport as well, and he selected rowing. Fernandez was quoted in the Yass Tribune: \\"At school, we had to play a summer sport. I had a mate who did a bit of rowing‚Ä¶ so I thought ‚Äòah well, I‚Äôll give it a go' \\" He later studied science at Adelaide University. During this time, he was recruited to the Adelaide University Boat Club when one of the regular members fell ill. He quickly rediscovered his love for the sport, and by the age of 19 was rowing for Australia. State and club rowing Fernandez made his first state crew for South Australia in the 1991 South Australian men's eight contesting the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He raced again in South Australian King's Cup crews in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and stroked those crews in 1992, 1993, 1994. After accepting a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport and during his senior Australian representative years, Fernandez raced the King's Cup in Australian Capital Territory crews. He rowed in the five seat of the ACT eight in 1997 to a King's Cup victory and rowed in three more ACT eights in 1998, 1999 and 2000. International representative rowing Fernandez' Australian representative debut came at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics when he was selected amongst a number of other new faces in the men's eight. They rowed to a fifth placing in the Olympic final. In 1993 Fernandez rowed in the four seat of the men's eight who competed at the 1993 World Rowing Championships on Racize, Croatia and placed fourth. By this time he was in residence at the Australian Institute of Sport and training with the Australian heavyweight sweep-oared squad under head coach Reinhold Batschi. In 1994 Batschi selected Fernandez and Nick Porzig in an Australian coxed four with David Weightman, Shane McLaughlin and with Brett Hayman on the rudder. They placed fifth at the World Championships in Indianapolis. That four also contested and won gold at the 1994 Commonwealth Regatta in Ontario, Canada held alongside the 1994 Commonwealth Games.1994 Commonwealth Regattahttp://www.rowingaustralia.com.au/athletes.asp?cmd=Details&ID;=23 In 1995 Fernandez was back in the Australian eight where he would stay for the rest of national representative career. At the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere Finland and stroked by Rob Scott they finished overall eleventh. Fernandez, Porzig, Hayman, Rob Jahrling, and Ben Dodwell remained in the Australian eight into the 1996 Olympic year and were joined in the crew by the Stewart twins and the New South Wales pair of Walker and Wearne taking over in the stern end. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics the Australian eight rowed to a sixth place. Following a post-Olympic break Fernandez stepped back into the five seat of the eight for the 1998 World Rowing Championships in Cologne where they rowed to a sixth placing. In 1999 the crew raced at the World Rowing Cup III before contesting the 1999 World Rowing Championships in St Catharine's Canada where they missed the A final and finished in seventh place. In 2000 the Australian eight qualified for the Olympics and raced at two Rowing World Cups in the lead up campaign as well as at the Henley Royal Regatta where they raced as an Australian Institute of Sport eight and won that year's Grand Challenge Cup. At Sydney 2000 with Fernandez at stroke, the Australian eight won their heat in a pace that blew away the eventual gold medallists Great Britain. However, in the final they started slowly and their late sprint home left them 0.8 seconds behind the Brits at the line and to take the silver Olympic medal in a thrilling finish.Fernandez at World Rowing Fernandez retired from rowing following the Sydney Olympics.

Ritual slaughter involves a prescribed practice of slaughtering an animal for food production purposes. This differs from animal sacrifices that involve slaughtering animals, often in the context of rituals, for purposes other than mere food production. Ritual slaughter as a mandatory practice of slaughter for food production is practiced by Muslim and Jewish communities totaling nearly 25% of the world population. Both communities have similar religious philosophies in this regard. Temple Grandin has researched Ritual Slaughter practices and says that abattoirs which use recommended practices cause livestock little pain; she calls the UK debate over Halal slaughterhouses misguided,http://www.grandin.com/ritual/rec.ritual.slaughter.html and suggests that inhumane treatment of animals happens in poorly run slaughterhouses regardless of their halal status.https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/we- spoke-to-temple-grandin-about-the-uk-halal-slaughterhouse-controversy The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC), which advises British government on how to avoid cruelty to livestock, on the other hand, says the way Jewish Kosher and Muslim Halal meat is produced causes severe suffering to animals. Ritual slaughter is in many EU countries the only exception from the standard requirement, guarded by criminal law, to render animal unconscious before slaughter (before any cutting). While the Jews accept absolutely no stunning (rendering unconscious prior to cutting), many Muslims have accepted it as long as it can be shown that the animal could be returned to normal living consciousness (so that stunning does not kill an animal but is intended to render following procedure painless).Religious slaughter of animals in the EU History Walter Burkert in Homo Necans discusses animal sacrifice as arising from the anthropological transition to hunting. With the domestication of livestock, the hunt was gradually replaced by the slaughter of livestock, and hunting rituals were consequently transformed to the context of slaughter. In antiquity, ritual slaughter and animal sacrifice was one and the same. Thus, as argued by Detienne et al. (1989), for the Greeks, consumption of meat not slaughtered ritually was unthinkable, so that beyond being a tribute to the gods, Greek animal sacrifice marked a cultural boundary, separating \\"Hellenes\\" from \\"barbarians\\". Greek animal sacrifice was christianized into slaughter ceremonies involving Greek Orthodox Christian ritual, known as kourbania. Ancient Egyptian slaughter rituals are frequently depicted in tombs and temples from the Old Kingdom onward. The standard iconography of the ritual involves a bull lying fettered on the ground with the butcher standing over it cutting its foreleg. The scene is attended by a woman and two priests.Eberhard Otto, An Ancient Egyptian Hunting Ritual, Journal of Near Eastern Studies (1950). Jewish and Islamic ritual slaughter Jewish and Islamic dietary laws require similar procedures for slaughtering animals. Ritual slaughter with a sharp knife is classified in the U.S. as 'humane' under the Humane Slaughter Act and practiced with no restrictions; in Europe, some countries have outlawed the practice as inhumane (see below). According to Jewish and Muslim law, \\"slaughter is carried out with a single cut to the throat, rather than the more widespread practices of stunning with a bolt into the head before slaughter.\\"Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end', BBC News, June 10, 2003, accessed September 18, 2006 BBC article from June 10, 2003 reporting that the FAWC thought that ritual slaughter in Britain should be banned. These recommendations were rejected by the government. The animal must be alive when its throat is cut and die from loss of blood. Any kind of prestunning for livestock to be slaughtered according to the Jewish Kosher practice has not yet been accepted.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific: Guidelines for Humane Handling, Transport and Slaughter of Livestock, chapter 7 Jewish Shechita 15th c. depiction of Jewish ritual slaughter of animals for consumption Shechita (Hebrew: ) is the Jewish ritual slaughter for poultry and cattle for food according to Halakha.Deut. 12:21; Deut. 14:21; Num. 11:22 Talmud ‚Äì Tractate Hulin Shulkhan Arukh Yore De'ah. The practice of slaughter of animals for food is the same as was used for Temple sacrifices, but since the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, sacrifices are prohibited. The Torah explains that animals not sacrificed must be slaughtered by the same practice, and today Shechita, kosher slaughtering does not include any religious ceremony, although the slaughtering practice may not be deviated from, if the meat is to be consumed by Jews. The act is performed by drawing a very sharp knife across the animal's throat making a single incision incising the trachea and esophagus. The carotid arteries are also cut, allowing the blood to drain out. The knife must also be perfectly smooth, and free of any nicks. The animal must be killed by a shochet - religious slaughterer also known in Hebrew as shochet ubodek (slaughterer and inspector). An inspection is mandatory and the animal is rejected for Jewish consumption if certain imperfections are discovered. A shochet must be a Jew in good standing in the community. The training period for a shochet varies, depending on the skill of the trainee. Qualifying as a slaughterer of only chickens can be achieved with a shorter period of study. Islamic ·∏éabƒ´·∏•ah ·∏éabƒ´·∏•ah () is the practice prescribed in Islam for slaughtering all halal animals (goats, sheep, cattle, chickens, etc.), only excluding fish and most sea-life, according to Islamic law. This means that unlawful animals (pig, dog, lion, etc.) may not be slaughtered (dabihah). This practice of slaughtering halal animals needs several conditions to be fulfilled: #the butcher must follow an Abrahamic religion (ie. to be Muslim, Christian, or Jew); #the name of God/Allah should be called while slaughtering each halal animal separately; #the killing should consist of complete drainage of blood from the whole body by a swift, deep incision with a very sharp knife on the throat, cutting the wind pipe, jugular veins and carotid arteries of both sides but leaving the spinal cord intact. The objective of this technique is to drain the body of the animal's blood more effectively, resulting in more hygienic meat.Halal/Haram/Zabiha, ISNA Halal Certification Agency. High-volume ritual slaughter Religious slaughter brings extra challenges for large, high-volume slaughterhouses where focus is on fast, cost-effective throughput. There has been reports that 3.2 cuts are in practice required for Jewish and 5.2 for Halal slaughter. It was also reported that for 1 in 10 animals arteries of an animal are not correctly severed resulting in prolonged death.  European restrictions on ritual slaughter  Legal requirements for ritual slaughter in Europe 2018: A number of countries in Europe (as well as Australia) have issued restrictions or outright bans on ritual slaughter. As of 2018, Slovenia is the only European country which has prohibited ritual slaughter altogether. A number of other countries, most notably in Scandinavia, has introduced legal requirements for animals to be stunned either before or just after having their throats cut during ritual slaughter. The question whether animals should be stunned or not remains a hotly contested issue, where animal welfare concerns regularly clash with religious concerns. Bans on ritual slaughter have been proposed or enacted in a number of European countries, from the 1840s onward. Most of them have been removed. Although ostensibly introduced for reasons of animal welfare, the consistent involvement of antisemites in the campaigns from the outset in the 1840s has, among other things led Pascal Krauthammer in a doctoral dissertation to conclude that the aim of the Swiss anti-Semitic campaign, that included elements from blood libel accusations in neighbouring countries, was to reimpose restrictions on Jews at a time when they were just beginning to achieve enfranchisement.Pascal Krauthammer. \\"Das Sch√§chtverbot in der Schweiz 1854 - 2000.

The Ritual Slaughter Question from the Aspects of Animal Protection, Politics and Xenophobia) (Includes a Summary in English) In 2014, Denmark ruled that Islamic and Jewish slaughter practices are inhumane, requiring that all animals be stunned before being killed for food, sparking a debate on religious freedom and the relative harms of different practices. In 2019, Belgium banned Kosher and halal slaughter. In 2020, a poll showed that 9 out of 10 Europeans want their governments to ban the slaughter of animals that have not been stunned.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/09/nine-out-of-10-eu- citizens-oppose-animal-slaughter-without-stunning-poll-finds Ethnic and regional traditions=Tauromachy Bullfighting and Running of the Bulls is still widely practiced in Spain, Portugal and many Spanish influenced areas of the Northern Mediterranean and Latin America. It is a modern adaptation of ancient ritual slaughter supposedly imported by Roman soldiers who worshiped Mithras. Bali Bali (pronounced Bal-ee) or Bali Sacrifice (sometimes known as Jhatka Bali) is the ritual killing of an animal in Hinduism. Jhatka is the prescribed practice for Hindu ritual sacrifice, however other practices such as strangulation and the use of a wooden spile (sphya) driven into the heart is used. The reason for this is that priests saw the animal making a noise as a bad omen. Jhatka requires the instant killing of the animal in a single decapitating blow with an axe or sword.

After a new Soviet Constitution was adopted in October 1977, the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR considered a draft constitution in which, in contrast to the Constitution of 1936, Georgian was no longer declared to be the sole State language. A series of indoor and outdoor actions of protest ensued and implied with near-certainty there would be a clash between several thousands of demonstrators and the Soviet government, but Georgian Communist Party chief Eduard Shevardnadze negotiated with the central authorities in Moscow and managed to obtain permission to retain the previous status of the Georgian language. This highly unusual concession to an open expression of opposition to state policy of the Soviet Union defused popular anger in Tbilisi, but triggered tensions in the Abkhaz ASSR (Abkhazia), an autonomous republic in northwest Georgia, where Abkhaz Communist officials protested against what they saw as a capitulation to Georgian nationalism and demanded that their autonomy be transferred from Georgia to the Russian SFSR. The request was rejected but a number of political, cultural and economic concessions were made. Since 1990, 14 April has been celebrated in Georgia as the Day of the Georgian Language.  Background  The late 1970s witnessed the reemergence of a Georgian national movement which called for the revival of Georgian national culture and, in its most radical form, saw no compromise to Georgia's ultimate independence from the Soviet Union, a rare instance of pro-independence dissident movement in the Union at the time. Although Georgian opposition intelligentsia preached avoidance of conflict with non-Georgian minorities, as such conflict would hamper the road to independence, and forged ties with the Russian dissidents of the time, including Andrei Sakharov, the movement had a strong anti-Russian emphasis and alarmed some minorities, especially in Abkhazia, where there was a lingering ethnic discord between Georgian and Abkhaz communities. In early 1977, the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB) managed to suppress most Russian dissident groups and moved to Georgia, with the irreconcilable Georgian opposition leaders, Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia, being arrested in April. Such measures failed to curb the movement, however. New influential young dissidents such as Tamar Chkheidze, Avtandil Imnadze, later Giorgi Chanturia, and Irakli Tsereteli, emerged in support of the jailed leaders, and several underground publications (samizdat) were founded.Cornell, Svante E. (2001), Small Nations and Great Powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus, pages 154‚Äì5. Routledge (UK), During this period Georgia acquired the position of the republic with the highest level of per capita higher education in the Soviet Union, and the increasing number of students, especially the rural youth with higher education and with little connection to the Communist Party and Nomenklatura, formed a ground for anti- Soviet sentiments.Cornell, Svante E. (2002), Autonomy and Conflict: Ethnoterritoriality and Separatism in the South Caucasus ‚Äì Case in Georgia , page 162. Department of Peace and Conflict Research, University of Uppsala,  Status of language  The three Transcaucasian republics ‚Äì Georgia, Armenian SSR and Azerbaijan SSR ‚Äì were the only Union republics where the language of a \\"titular nationality\\", in this case Georgian, enjoyed the status of sole state language.Olsen, James S., Pappas Lee B., Pappas Nicholas C. (1994), An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empries, p. 247‚Äì8. Greenwood Press, When in early 1978 the issue of adopting new constitutions in the republics, based on the 1977 Soviet Constitution, came up, an attempt was made by the Soviet authorities to remove the anomaly of the three Transcaucasian republics, replacing it with a clause giving an equally official status to the Russian language. The move was highly unpopular, but in Georgia the question of language was particularly sensitive and a negative outcry was quite predictable since a suggestion to hold certain courses in the local institutions of higher learning in Russian two years earlier, in April 1976, had provoked a public outrage. While the situation in Azerbaijan remained calm, the events proceeded in an unexpectedly dramatic manner in Georgia and to a lesser extent Armenia.  Protests  Demonstrations broke out throughout Georgia, reaching their climax in Tbilisi on 14 April 1978, the day when the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR convened to ratify the new legislation. An estimated 20,000,Sakwa, Richard (1998), Soviet Politics in Perspective, p. 241. Routledge, mainly university students, took to the streets. Several intellectuals, including the venerated 80-year-old linguist Akaki Shanidze, campaigned against reforming Article 75 (addressing the official status of Georgian), and leaflets calling for nationwide resistance appeared in the streets. The demonstrators marched to the House of the Government in downtown Tbilisi. The Soviet police (militsiya) officers managed to partially block the march, but around 5,000 people still managed to reach the government building, which was quickly surrounded by the Soviet army. The rest of the protesters gathered in and around Tbilisi State University. As the situation threatened to turn dangerous and rumors were coming of Soviet troops preparing for action, Eduard Shevardnadze, the First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party Central Committee, addressed the demonstrators and reminded them about the student demonstrators shot by the Soviet army in Tbilisi on 9 March 1956. Although he was booed when he first tried to speak to the crowd, Shevardnadze was quick to react. He immediately contacted Moscow and asked for permission to leave Article 75 unchanged. While the shocked Kremlin was contemplating the issue, Shevardnadze came out and spoke to the demonstrators, explaining the situation and pledging his sympathies to their cause. Finally, the government‚Äîgiving in to popular pressure‚Äîdecided not to change the disputed clause. The demonstrators began gradually to withdraw only after Shevardnadze announced the final decision and read out the article affirming the status of Georgian as the state language of the Georgian SSR.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, pages 309, 397. Indiana University Press,  Aftermath  Following this unprecedented concession to public opinion, Soviet authorities, alarmed by the mass actions in Georgia, abandoned similar amendments to the constitutions of Armenia and Azerbaijan and declared Armenian and Azerbaijani state languages at the republican level, without waiting for similar manifestations in either republic.Abrahamian, Levon Hm. (1998), Mother Tongue: Linguistic Nationalism and the Cult of Translation in Postcommunist Armenia, page 10. Berkeley Program in Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies. University of California, Berkeley Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies. The language issue in the Transcaucasian republics revealed the sensitivity of the national problem in the region. The upsurge of the national movement in Georgia proper led to tensions between minorities as well, in particular with the Abkhaz, who interpreted the concession by the Soviet authorities as a retreat in the face of Georgian nationalism and saw this as an opportunity to secede from Georgia. In May 1978, several thousands of Abkhaz nationalists assembled in the village of Lykhny to support 130 Abkhaz Communists, who had signed the letter to Moscow, demanding that the Abkhaz ASSR be allowed to be transferred from Georgia to the Russian SFSR. The Kremlin dispatched I.V. Kapitonov, secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, to Sukhumi and installed a new party leader, Boris Adleiba, in Abkhazia. Kapitonov declared that secession was impermissible, but the government acknowledged the seriousness of the Abkhaz problem by decreeing a costly plan \\"for the development of the economy and culture of the Abkhaz ASSR\\". An extra 500 million rubles were appropriated over seven years for economic investments such as a road-building program for infrastructure-poor Abkhazia, and cultural benefits such as the creation of an Abkhaz State University (with Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian sectors), a State Folk Dance Ensemble in Sukhumi, and Abkhaz-language television broadcasting. Besides, ethnic quotas were established for certain bureaucratic posts, giving the Abkhaz a degree of political power that was disproportionate to their minority status in the autonomous republic.Kaufman, Stuart J. (2001), Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War, p. 89. Cornell University Press, Both the Georgian language and Abkhaz questions were high on the agenda throughout the following years. Georgians living in Abkhazia protested about discrimination against them at the hands of the Abkhaz Communist Party √©lite and demanded equal access to the autonomous structures. Several Georgian intellectuals petitioned Shevardnadze and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to address the situation. During 1981, at least five mass demonstrations took place in Georgia at which the Abkhaz question was raised once again alongside broader issues connected with the defense of Georgian language, history, and culture. The protesters also demanded the release of Avtandil Imnadze, the only person who was arrested in connection with the events of 14 April 1978 for having filmed the student demonstrations in Tbilisi. –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∞, –õ—é–¥–º–∏–ª–∞ (1983), –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ.

Although Shevardnadze managed to comply with popular opinion without being punished or reprimanded by the centre, probably due to the success of his economic policy in Georgia, he still sought to neutralise the dissident movement in order to retain his reputation as a successful and loyal Communist leader. Under increasing pressure from the authorities, the national movement suffered a setback in April 1979, when the prominent Georgian dissident, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, was pardoned after having repented his views, admitting his \\"errors of judgment\\" on nationwide television. As Gamsakhurdia's close associate, Merab Kostava, refused to surrender, he remained an untainted leader of the Georgian dissident movement until his release in 1987 and his mysterious death in a car crash in 1989. The anti- nationalist measures also included the dismissal of Akaki Bakradze, a popular professor who taught a course on Georgian literature at Tbilisi University and was known for his anti-Soviet feelings. In March 1981, over 1,000 students protested and achieved the restoration of Bakradze to his position. Later that month, large groups of students and intellectuals demonstrated in defence of Georgian national rights and submitted to the Georgian party leadership a document entitled \\"The Demands of the Georgian People\\". The petition included proposals to protect the status of the Georgian language, improve the teaching of Georgian history and the preservation of Georgian historical monuments, and protect the Georgians in Abkhazia. Other Georgian protests took place in the town of Mtskheta in October 1981, when 2,000 people demonstrated in defence of their native language. Unrest continued, and, in 1982, intellectuals protested against the arrest of dissenters on trumped-up charges.  Legacy  The April 1978 demonstrations are considered by many as the starting point of a new phase of Georgia's national movement, which eventually led the country into widespread resistance to Soviet rule in the late 1980s and the declaration of Georgian independence on 9 April 1991. Since 1990, 14 April has been celebrated as the \\"Day of the Georgian Language\\". Although it is not an official holiday, it is customarily a date for commemorating the events of 1978 and summarizing what has been accomplished by the nation during the past year in the areas of teaching and research.Rabo, Annika and Utas, Bo (2005), The Role of the State in West Asia, p. 183.

It was founded in 1910 and is one of the oldest parishes in the Archdiocese. The church's feast day is the Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, which falls 19 days after Pentecost Sunday.  History = Founding  Front of the main church building, taken from Clemenceau Ave Fundraising for the church was begun in 1908 and the church was completed in 1910. The finances for the construction were largely donated by 3 wealthy Chinese benefactors, one of which was Mr Jacobe Low Kiok Chiang (1843‚Äì1911), the founder of the Bangkok and Singapore-based merchant firm, Kiam Hoa Heng. Mr Low was of Teochew descent and was born in Shantou, China. The Church was built mainly for a Cantonese congregation. On 15 February 1942, the church was damaged by Japanese artillery fire.  Improvements  The church was first renovated in 1969 and a 3-storey Parish Welfare Hall was established on 21 February 1971. Prior to the completion of the new Community Building in 2008, the top level was used for catechism classes, the second level was a canteen, while the ground level housed a small carpark. In 2008, the church was renovated again by Parish priest Rev Fr Paul Tay. A 7¬Ω storey community building which houses meeting, catechism and prayer rooms, priest offices, as well as a new cafeteria, was constructed to cater to the needs of the parishioners. A columbarium was also constructed directly behind the main church building. Previously, Fr Tay was also involved in the construction of a columbarium in the Church of St Theresa, as well as the establishment of the Church of the Holy Trinity which has since become the largest parish in Singapore. Interior of the main church building  Present  The church comprises a main church building, where Masses are celebrated, a 3-storey Parish Welfare Hall, as well as a 7¬Ω storey Community Building which sits on freehold land beside the Church. The land was vacant for many years but has now been put to good use.  Community building  In 2008, a 7¬Ω storey church community building was built to fulfil the needs of the parish community. Costing an estimated S$4.5 million, the building was constructed on freehold land and was completed in 2008 with a total floor area of 3,100 square metres. It was designed to blend in with the facade and structure of two existing shop-houses. The building currently houses meeting, catechism and prayer rooms, a music studio, a cafeteria and refreshment area, priest offices, a religious bookshop, as well as carparks on the 1st, 4th and 5th storeys. Directly next to the multi- purpose hall, where the cafeteria is now located, is a chapel, which is now used for weekday Masses celebrated from Monday to Thursday. Masses on Friday, as well as special feast days that fall on weekdays continue to be celebrated in the main church building. These days include Holy Days of Obligation such as Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and All Souls' Day, among others. Following his appointment as Apostolic Nuncio to Singapore in January 2011, Archbishop Leopoldo Girelli briefly resided in the church's community building, which also acted as the Vatican Embassy in Singapore.

The show was originally presented as a real event and managed to dupe many national newspapers in the UK before being revealed as a hoax. Beginning The show \\"Fuckart & Pimp\\" was conceived by Alex Chappel and freelance reporter David C. West. An initial press release was sent out in April 1998 to all the newspapers and media describing the concept show, to open on 17 April: \\"Fuckart and Pimp\\" featured a Canadian artist named Angela Marshall. The gallery (the Pimp) prostitutes the artist (the Whore), and the buyer (the Punter) has to consummate the sale of a painting by performing a sexual act with Angela. It was billed as \\"a stark comment on the world of contemporary art\\", and the show would \\"enable both the punter and Angela to fully understand the workings of the curator-artist relationship\\". photographs were encouraged, \\"A small picture will cost ¬£25 and require oral sex; a medium-size picture is full sex, at ¬£50 and for a large painting at ¬£75, 'anything kinky'\\". Media assault That same day, from 9 p.m. onwards, the Decima gallery became besieged by press reporters. Everyone from the tabloids to ITN arrived, and as they were all expecting to see an art show, one was staged. Angela Marshall arrived to the glare of lenses, \\"squeezed into a nine year old's leopard print leotard (she aspires to be 'in her twenties') and sporting a red rhinestone dog collar, hat, gloves, torn black stockings, topped by a blond wig and dark sunglasses\\", as The Scotsman reported.The Scotsman, 18 April 1998 The crowds stayed away, \\"possibly deterred by the ranks of camera crews and reporters gathered outside the gallery\\", as The Guardian speculated. The reason for them not materialising, however, was the fact that none ever existed to begin with; thus, to curb the media hunger, a punter was invented in the form of \\"someone calling himself Mark Childs and claiming to be a buyer\\". As The Scotsman put it, \\"Under a dim red light bulb, a man and two women - the second being the artist's Scottish 'assistant' Jessica Konopka - thrashed about on a dirty mattress in a pathetic pantomime copulation\\". On London Tonight, Mark Childs could be seen leaving the gallery with lipstick-smeared face, carrying a digitally blurred painting. The reason why the painting was digitally blurred is because it bore the lipstick scrawled slogan 'Media Cunts'. Threatened legal action A counter sabotage that fuelled much of the coverage was Southwark council's letter presented in full view of the cameras, 'warning that the property appeared to be being used for sexual entertainment, and that the show's curator may have committed an offence. If the exhibition continued, the gallery would be risking prosecution. This was on the evidence of the eyewitness reports of the undercover council officer who paid five pounds to watch the act through a spy hole, and was reported by The Scotsman as saying 'she's still wearing the G-string but he's got all his kit off and they're definitely at it.' 'Nick', as he was called in the article, publicly issued a warning for obscenity. Despite the insistence that the warning would not hinder the show continuing over the weekend, the pinnacle of the event had been reached and it did not continue. Hoaxers play to the gallery The following day, 18 April, nearly every paper reported on the event, some skeptical as to its authenticity; it was only The Daily Telegraph that actually caught on with the headline 'Hoaxers play to the gallery with sex and art show,' with a sub heading 'Tom Leonard reports on the elaborate and bizarre activities of two publicity- seekers'. 'Faking it in the name of art' gave a brief synopsis of the previous lengthier stories with the small inclusion of a quote: 'yesterday show organiser David West admitted, \\"It was a hoax...a charade.\\"'The Sunday Mirror, 19 April 1998 The nationwide press were reluctant to follow up the original story with the truth, and potentially suffer embarrassment, thus, outside of the UK many were ignorant of the fact that it was a hoax.

It is situated 18 km east of Stratford at the intersection of East Road, Ohura Road, Douglas Road South and Bredow Road. East Road and Ohura Road meet to form State Highway 43, linking Stratford to the King Country town of Taumarunui. The Stratford‚ÄìOkahukura Line, a secondary railway line, runs through Douglas where it veers north-east and away from the state highway for approximately 20 km. Geography The entrance to Douglas from the west with the Stratford‚ÄìOkahukura Line railway crossing State Highway 43 in the foreground (December 2007). Douglas is centred on the Toko Stream adjacent to a small saddle crossed by Ohura Road to the east. The wider locality takes in State Highway 43 from Gordon Road in the west to Mangaotuku Road in the east. The reclaimed swamplands of the upper Toko valley are the dominant geographic feature, running from the north to the south-west of Douglas, at approximately 200m above sea level. Sandstone/greywacke ridges rise to between 300-370m altitude on each side of the valley floor. Peaks include Tarerepo trig to the north-east (366m altitude), Oruru trig to the south-east (329m) and Makuri trig to the south (327m). Crown Road provides access to farms below the Makuri trig, Bredow Road to farms below the Oruru trig, and Douglas Road to farms in the upper end of the valley (Tarerepo trig). Douglas Road links Douglas to Huiroa, Te Popo, Kiore and Matau. East of Douglas State Highway 43 (Ohura Road) crosses the Douglas Saddle into the Makuri Valley, which runs parallel to the Toko at approximately 175m above sea level. This is also predominantly reclaimed swamp, while adjoining ridges rise with considerable precipitousness. Walter Road gives access to Makuri valley farms to the north of the main road. History Douglas is said to have been named for a member of the Crown's surveying party. It is called Oruru by MƒÅori after the native owl ruru (or morepork). The current town was established at the turn of the 20th century and its hinterland cleared for pastoral farming. A hall was established in 1905 and a primary school in 1906. Through the first half of the century Douglas was a lively village with a productive brick kiln, a milk factory, a railway station, a store, a number of other businesses, and a church. In the 1930s the Douglas saleyards had the greatest turnover of all Taranaki saleyards, particularly in Jersey cattle for cream and cheese production. The Douglas Boarding House, which still stands today, served as an important stopping point for eastbound travellers making the long journey through difficult terrain to Whangam≈çmona or Taumarunui.Church, Ian (1990), The Stratford Inheritance. Heritage Press Ltd., Waikanae, New Zealand. Like other rural settlements, Douglas went into decline from the mid-20th century. Its primary school closed at the end of 2005 in its 100th year, and pupils were transferred to nearby Toko School. The community hall and tennis courts remain in the possession of the community. Douglas area unit Douglas lends its name to the census area unit of Douglas, which takes in those localities within the Patea and Waitara river catchments to the east of Toko, also including Strathmore, Huiakama, Te Wera, Pohokura, Huiroa, Kiore, Matau, Tututawa, Puniwhakau and Makahu. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, Douglas has a population of 732, a decrease of 60 people since the 2006 census. The population is also very ethnically homogenous, with 96.9% identifying as New Zealand European. 9.3% identify as Maori (people can identify as belonging to more than one ethnic group, so the figures exceed 100%).

Daly House is a historic house located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is a National Historic Landmark, notable for its association with Reginald Aldworth Daly (1871‚Äì1957), an eminent geologist, Penrose Medal winner, and Harvard University professor. The house is a two-story wood frame structure, estimated to have been built in the 1880s or 1890s. The house is styled in a Queen Anne/Shingle style, but is not particularly architecturally distinguished. Its interior had (as of its designation in 1976) not been significantly altered since Daly's death. Reginald Daly was born in Ontario, and was educated at Victoria College (now the University of Toronto). He then engaged in graduate studies at Harvard, earning an MA. and PhD in geology. In 1908 Daly began teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in 1912 he joined the faculty of Harvard, where he remained for the rest of his life. He purchased this house in 1910. Daly's contributions to the field of geology were wide-ranging: he was one of the first to synthesize a consistent theory of igneous rocks, based on an extensive analysis of a large body of physical evidence. He was also instrumental in bringing physics and chemistry into the study of geology. He was widely recognized by his peers, and received numerous honors, including the first honorary degree granted by his alma mater, Victoria College. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was further included in the Old Cambridge Historic District in 1983.

This PC game is the sequel to Champion Dreams: First to Ride and is also part of the second series of Petz. The user plays as Flora (the default name), a new member of the Sycamore Academy. Players select a horse from one of five breeds and a range of colours. The player trains their horse in different disciplines, enters shows, cares for the horse, and after a few weeks gains a foal to raise. Horsez is also known as Pippa Funnell 3: The Golden Stirrup Challenge. Gameplay The player arranges a timetable so that they can pass each week. To pass, they must obtain a certain score out of 10 for each of the disciplines, and must train in that discipline at least twice a week. The disciplines are Horse Care, Cross Country, Dressage, Showjumping, and later Foal Care and Learning. The player must also have a high social rating, which is obtained by spending time in the Student Centre talking to other academy riders, performing well in disciplines, taking and displaying photographs in the Student Centre, and purchasing items from the shops. Between training and caring for their horse, foal, and talking to the other riders, the player may go shopping, change their attire in their bedroom, study in the library, and go for a walk with their horse. There is a total of ten secret figurines hidden in the game. Throughout the game, the player is given free control of the protagonist or the horse. There are numerous cutscenes, events where the player character must find something, and riddles. These events, combined with the contrasting disciplines, ensure variable gameplay. Starting First, the player must choose a name for the character they will be playing and a mount. The player can choose from 5 breeds: Arabian Thoroughbred, English Thoroughbred, Connemara, Appaloosa and Saddlebred. Each breed has a range of colours including a number of shades of brown, bay, and grey. After the horse is selected and named, the game begins with a journal entry and a cutscene. Characters The main characters are Flora and her horse. Other characters include the staff at the riding academy, fellow riders, and later the player's rival, Daniela. Daniela's director is Esteban. In the Student Centre, the player can talk to her friends and learn their stories. Disciplines * Horse Care: Taking care of a horse. Horse Care includes hosing, grooming, picking his hooves, and mucking his stall. It is best to do this at least 3 times a week. * Cross Country: The player canters the horse around the course. * Dressage: The player presses the left and right arrow keys in time to make your horse perform the correct gait. Other keys are also used to control the horse. Gaits must be learned from library books before the horse can perform them. * Showjumping: A fairly difficult discipline to master. * Foal Care: Once the player has a foal, they must take care of it. During Foal Care, the foal will perform three actions. The player needs to guess what the foal wants based on what it does. The foal's actions can be analyzed by reading library books. * Learning: Once the player has the foal, they need to raise it. Learning involves teaching the foal different gaits. Horsez 2 A sequel to Horsez was developed with somewhat similar plots: the main character is a young woman named Emma. She is sent to France to train to become a veterinarian. When the taxi breaks down, she has no choice but to take refuge in a small, quiet town. There, she meets Oliver, a nephew of his aunt's stud farm, who is missing its real owner, Marie. After finding out Emma is a vet, he offers to give her shelter if she helps them deliver a mare with foal. Emma agrees. After meeting Flora, Michael (formerly called Miguel in Horsez), and Carol, Emma is given some objectives. The character delivers a healthy foal, and then is given the choice of the player to stay with the stud farm or leave as a vet. The game continues either way. In the end, the characters win back the stud farm, though end results are dependent on the player's choices throughout the game. In one part, Emma finds out that Marie is still alive and well. In this ending she leaves the stud farm to Flora, and promises to visit soon, having settled in New Zealand. Other possible endings include Emma getting Oliver (and herself) tickets to the US so she can show him her country, and Emma and Oliver sharing a kiss on the beach.

It first aired on CBS in the United States on May 24, 2005. The episode is written by John Kelley and directed by Thomas J. Wright, and was seen by 14.74 million viewers. With Ari Haswari back in the country again and out to kill Gibbs, the team find themselves attempting to stop Ari from completing the task. In the meantime, they also try to find out who killed two off-duty sailors whose deaths might be linked to an upcoming terrorist attack and the theft of a drone from a company. But in the end, it might not be enough as NCIS find themselves paying a very high price for their efforts when one of their own is brutally murdered in Gibbs and Ari's battle with each other... The episode also marks the final regular appearance of Special Agent Kate Todd (played by Sasha Alexander), who is later replaced by Mossad Officer Ziva David (played by Cote de Pablo). Todd is later shown in Season 8, episode \\"A Man Walks Into a Bar...\\" as a memory by the rest of the team, and in the Season 9 episode \\"Life Before His Eyes\\" as the wife of DiNozzo in an alternative universe in Gibbs' mind. Both of the episodes include scenes from this episode as flashbacks. Plot Two men are gunned down in their car, both pilots and navy lieutenants. NCIS is called in to investigate the deaths. Both hands are missing on one of the lieutenants, making it look like a professional hit. While collecting evidence, DiNozzo discovers a bomb under the car, which explodes close to the team, making Gibbs believe someone is after them. Abby cannot identify the C-4 used in the bomb, and Director Morrow indicates there may be other factors involved. Gibbs later meets Ari Haswari, a double agent for the FBI with whom he has had complications previously. FBI agent Fornell is called in to inform Gibbs about Ari's mission in the US, and together with Director Morrow, he tells Gibbs not to interfere with the mission. Because of the history between Gibbs and Ari, Director Morrow places Gibbs under protective custody under the lead of ex-Secret Service agent Todd. The investigation continues, leading to the discovery of a missing target drone from the workplace of one of the dead pilots. Gibbs is sure Ari is behind the deaths and forces Fornell to locate him. Ari's location reveals he is not a double agent, but the one who runs the terrorist cell. The team figures out Ari's location and is attacked by several terrorists. The drone is on the top of the building, and one finger from the dead pilot's hand is used to launch the drone. McGee tries to take control over the drone while Gibbs, Todd, and DiNozzo takes the terrorists down. One terrorist ambushes the team and shoots at Gibbs. Todd protects him, and she is hit by the bullet. The bullet proof vest she wears stops her from being hurt. She gets up and the team relaxes and jokes with each other. DiNozzo tells Todd that she did good, pleasantly surprising her, and she says, \\"Wow, I thought I'd die before I ever heard a complim‚Äì\\", when a lone bullet suddenly emerges from out of nowhere and rips through her head, killing her instantly. Ari is revealed to be the murderer, shown behind a sniper rifle on top of a nearby building. Gibbs and DiNozzo are absolutely stunned. DiNozzo's face is covered in a splash of Kate's blood, and Gibbs points his gun into the distance, knowing Ari was the shooter. Production Bert the Hippo, first shown in this episode. Sasha Alexander's character Kate Todd was killed in the episode. The episode is written by John Kelley and directed by Thomas J. Wright. Executive producer Donald P. Bellisario got the message about Sasha Alexander wanting to leave the show when he was writing the episode \\"SWAK\\". \\"This was the first time she went over a year on a show,\\" says Bellisario of Alexander, \\"and she just didn't think she had the stamina to do it.\\" He added, \\"Any time you kill a regular character on a show after it's gone at least two full seasons and people have come to love the character, it's bound to have a ripple effect. I had already started writing the last episode of the season and was getting ready to go to Australia to take a little break. Sasha came in two days before I was to leave, and with tears in her eyes, she said, 'I just can't work this hard. Later, he said of his response, \\"I told her, 'All right, then I'm going to kill you.' She was taken aback.\\" \\"Do I regret leaving? I absolutely don't, for a million reasons that I've never spoken out about ... for a million reasons that I can't. I had a wonderful time doing it for two years, though,\\" Alexander stated in an interview by Jay Bobbin. Before the episode aired, it was known one of the main characters would die. Bellisario reportedly filmed two endings to keep the identity of the character a secret, and Mark Harmon jokingly remarked, \\"We're all personally hoping it's us, because we're all so tired, we're hoping we're going to get killed.\\" During the episode, other characters also did face threats to their lives. Both Tony and Gibbs were in real danger, which kept the viewers unsure about who would die. \\"It was one of the best kept secrets,\\" according to producer Mark Horowitz. The producers wanted to mark the departure of Alexander with a bang. \\"That didn't just happen\\" was the response they wanted from the viewers. Bellisario remarked, \\"In reality, things like that happen in NCIS. People die, and I wanted to make this death really impactful when it happened.\\" Four characters are recurring in this episode. Brian Dietzen as Medical Assistant Jimmy Palmer, Joe Spano as Senior FBI Agent Tobias Fornell, Alan Dale as NCIS Director Thomas Morrow, and Rudolf Martin as rogue agent Ari Haswari. Haswari was previously seen in the season one episodes \\"B√™te Noire\\" (as an unnamed intruder) and \\"Reveille\\". Reception \\"Twilight\\" was seen by 14.74 million live viewers following its broadcast on May 24, 2005. The loss of agent Todd was received as a shock by fans, and series creator Bellisario had to point out it was Alexander's own choice to leave the show. Before, the press had shown little interest about NCIS, but with the death of one of the main characters, the situation became different. The reruns in the summer also got high numbers of viewers, which the producers explained to be because of the press cover in the aftermath of agent Todd's death. Julian Spivey from Examiner.com included \\"Twilight\\" in his January 2012 compilation of the \\"10 greatest episodes of 'NCIS, saying, > Going into the season two finale of NCIS we all knew that one of the main > cast members was going to be killed ... but we didn't know how and we didn't > know who.

It was written, produced, and arranged by Robbie Buchanan and Jay Landers. It was first released on the album Disney Princess: The Ultimate Song Collection. The song is sung from the point of view of the first eight official Disney Princesses. It has been featured on several Disney music CDs, and its music video is present on nearly every Disney Princess DVD, as either an extra or a Sing- Along, and was shown several times on Disney Channel. The song has been covered by teen country singer Ashley Gearing, and a shorter altered version performed by a different set of singers is featured in the ongoing Disney on Ice show Princess Wishes as the show finale. More recently, it serves as the exit song to Disneyland Paris' nighttime show Disney Illuminations. Singers *Susan Stevens Logan as Snow White and Cinderella *Christie Houser as Princess Aurora *Jodi Benson as Princess Ariel *Paige O'Hara as Belle *Judy Kuhn as Pocahontas *Lea Salonga as Princess Jasmine and Mulan Song details One of the most notable aspects of the song is that all but three of the princesses's original voice actresses reprise their singing roles. Adriana Caselotti, Ilene Woods and Mary Costa do not reprise their roles as Snow White, Cinderella and Princess Aurora. Lea Salonga, who provided the singing voice of both Princess Jasmine and Mulan reprised both roles in this song. Each princess sings lyrics that reference their own story. For example, one of Cinderella's lines is \\"One day the slipper fits, then you see the love in his eyes,\\" one of Belle's lines is \\"So the story goes, never die the rose...,\\" Pocahontas' primary line being \\"The colors of the wind will lead my heart right back to you...\\" and Jasmine's line being \\"There's a whole new world waiting there for us\\". In the Princess Wishes Disney on Ice show, the line \\"The colors of the wind will lead my heart right back to you,\\" is changed to \\"The music of the wind will lead my heart right back to you,\\" since Pocahontas is absent from the show. The show also changes the lines from \\"So the story goes/Never die the rose\\" to \\"Once upon a dream/Wish and it will seem\\". While these lines were originally sung by Belle, they altered ones were given to Aurora in order for her to have a solo part. Music video The music video for the song consist of footage arranged in a montage from the films the featured Princesses are originally from including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas, and Mulan. The footage is edited by Industrial Light & Magic in an attempt to make the princesses mouth movements lipsync with their respective song vocals.

It tells the story of three cases of man-eaters through the memoirs of those who hunted them and, in the case of the third episode, accidentally unleashed them on their community. The first tells the story of Jim Corbett, played by Jason Flemyng and the Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag. The second tells the story of George Rushby and the Lions of Njombe, and the third tells the story of the Wolf of Gysinge. Inaccuracies \\"The Man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag\\" episode heavily differs from Corbett's memoirs: In the film, Corbett is shown as a bare-faced young man at the time. In reality, Corbett was a fifty-year-old with a moustache. In the film, when asked how they will find the leopard, Corbett says on two occasions that they will wait for it to kill again. In reality, Corbett said that was unacceptable. The centrepiece of the film is not the investigation and hunt for the leopard, but rather a story about the Ibbotsons, in which the struggles of an ambitious bureaucrat and his unloved wife are pitched against Corbett and the forest. The hunt for the leopard is featured as more of a subplot that always takes a back seat to the Ibbotson melodrama and the other two subplots in which Corbett builds fond friendships with the local pundit and an Indian boy named Sanji and whose scenes are usually quite short and rushed compared to the former. In the film, the Indian boy Sanji accompanies Corbett and assists him while he is tracking a couple of times. In reality, Corbett always tracked and hunted alone (except with Ibbotson) after a learning experience with his first man-eater in 1907. This Indian boy's death by the leopard was the driving force that caused Corbett to use the gin trap in the film. In reality, Corbett first used the trap much earlier in the hunt and when a leopard (the wrong one) fell for it and he accidentally freed it, Corbett and Ibbotson tracked it down and Corbett shot it in the head. In the film, Corbett was sick at the time and killed it while it leaped at him, passing out right afterwards. In the film, Corbett is shown fatally wounding the leopard after it had gravely injured the pundit, who was bringing him a rifle light, while running down a path in a thunderstorm. In reality, Corbett shot the leopard by torch light while sitting in a machan. The pundit was not only alive and well, but among the first to hear the shot and called out to Corbett for a status update about the leopard. Corbett, not wanting to scare away the possibly wounded leopard, did not answer, and the pundit quickly closed the door of his cottage.

Background The roots of the playing of rugby football in Parramatta lie in the 19th century with the formation of the Parramatta Rugby Club (now known as Parramatta Two Blues) founded in 1879. With the advent of a Sydney Rugby union District competition in 1900, the Parramatta club merged with the Western Suburbs club, with the club playing some of its matches at Cumberland Oval. When the NSWRL Premiership was formed in 1908, a club made up of Western Suburbs Rugby Union ‚Äúdefectors‚Äù formed the Central Cumberland club which participated in the first year of competition before the club was absorbed into the Western Suburbs DRLFC, also formed in 1908. Rugby league began to be played in the Parramatta district in 1909 with local teams, such as Iona and Endeavours, forming a district competition. Many other clubs within the Parramatta district also emerged with clubs being established in suburbs across the district over the ensuing decades and a Western Districts side representing the area in the President's Cup. Agitation in the area for a local club to participate in the NSWRL Premiership began in the mid-1930s with a formal proposal put to the NSWRL in 1936 by local Rugby League identities such as Jack Argent and Jack Scullin. The proposal was rejected by all clubs except Western Suburbs. 1940s The advent of World War II put the establishment of the club on hold and a Parramatta district club was not proposed again until 1946 when the club was successfully admitted into the Premiership. In the 1947 NSWRFL season, Parramatta's first, they finished at the bottom of the table, with one less win than fellow premiership debutants, Manly-Warringah. In 1948, Parramatta were winless in their first eleven matches but the signing of former Western Suburbs and Leeds five-eighth Vic Hey as captain-coach helped them to eighth with five wins and a draw. In 1949, with popular former Balmain winger Mitchell Wallace setting tryscoring records beaten only during their golden age of the 1980s,Parramatta: Most Tries in a Season the ‚ÄúFruitpickers‚Äù as the club was popularly known,Collis, Ian and Whiticker, Alan; The History of Rugby League Clubs; pp. 189-192 finished fifth with eight wins and four draws. The club also saw utility back Ian Johnston win its first Australian guernsey. 1950s The promise of 1949 was not fulfilled during the 1950s. Hey had been plagued by injury in his first two years at the club and retired as a player after 1949, with the result that Parramatta fell back to ninth in 1950 before winning nine matches in 1951. In their first five seasons Parramatta had won 28 and drawn eight of their ninety matches for a not disrespectful 35.56 percent winning rate, but the period from 1952 to 1961 was to prove the most disastrous of any NSWRFL club since University won only fifteen matches in nine seasons between 1929 and 1937. In these seasons Parramatta won only 35 and drew two of 180 matches and claimed the wooden spoon on no fewer than eight occasions, including six in succession from 1956 to 1961. After Hey moved on at the end of 1953 Parramatta went on a merry-go-round with coaches: they had five in as many years from 1954 to 1958, and even former Rabbitoh premiership coach Jack Rayner could not lift them off the bottom between 1958 and 1960.Parramatta Eels coaches Apart from the recruitments of international backrower ‚ÄúMick‚Äù Crocker for a then-record single-season fee in 1954‚ÄòCrocker will play here‚Äô; The Sydney Morning Herald, 20 January 1954, p. 16 and prized Yass hooker Bill Rayner in 1956, Parramatta was almost completely reliant upon local juniorsHeads, Ian and Middleton, David; A Centenary of Rugby League 1908-2008: the Definitive Story of the Game in Australia, Pan Macmillan. and not nearly enough quality players could be found for competitiveness; however, there were notable players like hardman prop Roy Fisher, who played a record 170 consecutive grade games between 1954 and 1962.Middleton, David; Rugby League 1990-91, pp. 104, 121 1960s 1960 was to prove the most disastrous season in Parramatta's history, with the club, despite the recruitment of Toowoomba centre Ron Boden, finishing last in all three grades.Haddan, Steve; History of the NSW Rugby League Finals; p. 135 1961 saw the acquisition of international back-rowers Ron Lynch from Forbes in country NSW and Brian Hambly from South Sydney, but the blue and golds, despite a promising start under captain-coach Boden with two early victories, won only one more game and returned to their familiar place at the foot of the ladder. Under coach Ken Kearney, Parramatta ended their run of six consecutive wooden spoons by finishing the 1962 NSWRFL season in fourth place, making the play-offs for the first time and emulating this feat in the lower grades. With new recruits Ken Thornett (who became known as ‚ÄúThe Mayor‚Äù) from English club Leeds and talented half-back Bob Bugden from St George, Parramatta had their most successful season since their inception before being eliminated from the finals in the first round by Western Suburbs. Despite the addition of skilful second-row forward Dick Thornett for 1963, ultimate success would continue to elude Parramatta with the side being knocked out of the 1963 finals by St George. Finishing second in 1964 Parramatta were thrashed 42‚Äì0 by the Dragons in the major semi-final, before being knocked out by Balmain; their Third Grade team did however win the club's first premiership. In the 1965 season, with Ken Thornett as coach, the side finished in third position. However, Grand Final qualification would continue to elude them and Parramatta would again bow out of the finals, this time defeated by South Sydney. Parramatta completed the rest of the 1960s in the middle of the ladder, without any further play-off appearances, finishing seventh in 1966, ninth in 1967, and sixth in 1968 and 1969. 1970s Parramatta finished with the wooden spoon, the club's tenth, in 1970, but with Ken Thornett returning finished fourth and again qualified for the play-offs in 1971. However, Parramatta again failed to progress in the minor semi, being defeated by St George, and fell back to last position in 1972 despite possessing class players like Bob O'Reilly, Denis Fitzgerald, and Keith Campbell. The Eels luckily avoided the wooden spoon in 1973 and 1974, but began the 1975 season by winning its first-ever senior trophy when they defeated Manly in their first-ever Pre-Season Cup (Wills Cup) final. In the main premiership, Parramatta after a promising start fell off, losing seven and drawing one of nine games mid-season. A rush in the last six weeks saw them easily win five games to finished equal fifth (sixth on percentages) with Balmain and Western Suburbs and were forced into a play-off for fifth position. Parramatta, on a roll, achieved a string of elimination play-off victories, defeating Western Suburbs (18‚Äì13) and then Balmain (19‚Äì8) to qualify for the semi-finals in fifth position. Parramatta played Canterbury-Bankstown in the preliminary final, achieving another narrow victory 6‚Äì5. However, in the minor semi-final Parramatta's courageous run of victories ‚Äì achieved despite crippling injury tollClarkson, Alan; ‚ÄòParra 13 Refuse to Be Beaten‚Äô; Sydney Morning Herald, 1 September 1975, p. 13 ‚Äì ended with a 22‚Äì12 defeat by Manly. In 1976 a new coach, Terry Fearnley, joined the Eels. In the same year several of Parramatta's greatest players joined the club. These included Rugby union recruit and 1975 Wallaby tourist, Ray Price who would go on to represent both NSW and Australia in Rugby league. Another new recruit was five-eighth John Peard. Nicknamed ‚Äúthe Bomber‚Äù, Peard was encouraged by Terry Fearnley to develop his tactical kicking game (the ‚Äúbomb‚Äù) as an attacking technique. As the 1976 season progressed Parramatta emerged as one of the best performing sides, finishing second in the competition. In the major preliminary semi-final Parramatta decisively defeated St George 31‚Äì6 and met Manly in the major semi final. In a close match Parramatta narrowly defeated the Sea-Eagles with a late try to winger Graeme Atkins (who scored from a Peard bomb) and qualified for the club's first Grand Final. In the Grand Final, against the same Manly side they had defeated two weeks before, Parramatta were trailing 13‚Äì10 after 71 minutes. Receiving a penalty five metres from the goal line, the Eels formed a controversial flying wedge formation (now a banned movement in both Rugby codes) and pushed towards the goal line. The wedge collapsed before the goal line and Parramatta's Ron Hilditch, who held the ball at the apex of the wedge, was tackled by Manly's Graham Eadie and the match ended with the scores unaltered.Sean Fagan, Fearnley‚Äôs Flying Wedge And The ‚Äò76 Eels Retrieved on 5 September 2006; Alan Whiticker, Grand Finals of the NSWRL (2e), Gary Allen, 1994 Bolstered with the recruitment of goal-kicking Australian representative centre Mick Cronin Parramatta finished as minor premiers in 1977. Meeting St George in the Grand Final, the scores ended at 9-all after a powerful Ray Price line-break lead to a try. Cronin missed the final conversion that would have broken the tied scores. After a period of extra time passed with the scores unchanged the two sides met in a replay the next weekend.

After the first minor semi-final final ended in a 13‚Äì13 draw a replay was required and Parramatta were defeated 17‚Äì11, but Manly appeared to have scored the winning try on the seventh tackle. In 1979, Parramatta made it to the major semi-final but were defeated by St George 15‚Äì11 and lost the preliminary to Canterbury 20‚Äì14. 1980s In 1980, despite the recruitment of veteran Arthur Beetson and the emergence of notable players such as Eric Grothe, Steve Ella and Brett Kenny, Parramatta missed the finals for the first time since 1974. Parramatta, under coach Jack Gibson, finished third in the competition and began their finals campaign with a major preliminary semi against Newtown Jets whom they narrowly defeated 10‚Äì8. An extra time victory over minor Premiers Eastern Suburbs 12‚Äì8 followed and Parramatta qualified for the club's third Grand Final. Playing against Newtown, Parramatta led the Grand Final at half time, 7‚Äì6. A try to Newtown captain Tommy Raudonikis soon after half-time gave Newtown an 11‚Äì7 lead. However, Parramatta responded with a try to winger Graeme Atkins. Michael Cronin was able to convert the try and in the final five minutes of the match the Eels scored twice more to seal a 20‚Äì11 victory and their first-ever Premiership. In Parramatta, a large crowd of supporters greeted the team as they arrived back at the Leagues Club (situated adjacent to Cumberland Oval). The already condemned grandstand and scoreboard at the Oval was set alight during the celebration by supporters and destroyed.Grantlee Kieza, ‚ÄòDing dong the witch is dead‚Äô, Daily Telegraph 24 September 2004 The following year, with Cumberland Oval unavailable, Parramatta played home matches at Canterbury- Bankstown's Belmore Oval and finished the season as minor premiers. With a then-record 619 points and 21 victories, 1982 was statistically the club's most successful season. In the major semi-final Parramatta were defeated by Manly 20‚Äì0, which allowed Manly to qualify for the Grand Final. With a second chance Parramatta rebounded in an extremely wetSydney Observatory Hill (066062) September 1982 rainfall preliminary final to defeat Eastern Suburbs 33‚Äì0 and qualified to play Manly in the Grand Final. This qualification would continue the developing rivalry that the two clubs had developed since the 1970s.Ray Chesterton, ‚ÄòThe Ghosts of Greatness‚Äô, Daily Telegraph, 1 May 2006 On Grand Final day, despite conceding the first try, Parramatta scored four tries before the half-time break. Manly's Les Boyd scored soon after the break, though it was their last try of the match and with Brett Kenny scoring in the sixtieth minute Parramatta recorded a 21‚Äì8 victory and a second consecutive premiership. Parramatta finished second in the 1983 Premiership season, and opened the finals with a 30‚Äì22 win over Canterbury before being defeated by Manly-Warringah in the major semi-final, however the Eels defeated Canterbury in the Preliminary Final to qualify for another Grand Final against Manly. In the Grand Final Parramatta built a 12‚Äì0 half-time lead, which Brett Kenny extended after half-time and, with Cronin's conversion, the Eels lead 18‚Äì0 and ultimately won 18‚Äì6. Parramatta's third consecutive premiership was the first treble in the NSWRFL Premiership since St George's domination of the 1950s and 1960s. Jack Gibson departed after the 1983 season and was replaced by former Cronulla and Woy Woy Roosters five-eighth John Monie. Under Monie Parramatta qualified for their fourth Grand Final in a row in 1984 after an 8‚Äì7 defeat of St George in the final. Parramatta faced minor premiers Canterbury-Bankstown who had defeated the Eels the week before, 16‚Äì8 to qualify for the Grand Final. The Grand Final was a low-scoring affair, with the Bulldogs defeating Parramatta 6‚Äì4. The Eels finished fourth in 1985 and, with defeats of Penrith and Balmain in the final series, progressed to the Preliminary Final against Canterbury-Bankstown with a chance to qualify for a fifth straight Grand Final. However, Parramatta were defeated 26‚Äì0 and Canterbury-Bankstown would go on to win the Grand Final. Parramatta, playing out of the newly opened Stadium, finished minor premiers and qualified for the Grand Final with a 28‚Äì6 victory over Canterbury-Bankstown in the Finals. The Bulldogs defeated Balmain to qualify for another Grand Final against Parramatta. The Grand Final would end without either side scoring a try, the first time this had happened in the history of the competition. Two successful goal attempts by Michael Cronin gave the Eels a 4‚Äì2 victory. Both Michael Cronin and Ray Price chose to make the Grand Final victory their last game in Rugby league and both retired from the game. Between 1987 and 1996 the Eels failed to make the finals. Parramatta finished seventh in 1987, eleventh in 1988, and eighth in 1989. The old stars remained at the club, but injuries plagued all of them, especially Grothe and Geoff Bugden, whilst the cost of retaining Kenny and Sterling under the new salary cap had the effect of forcing the club to discard large numbers of promising juniors. Their only notable recruit, star Queensland backrower Bob Lindner, stayed only two seasons before moving to the Gold Coast. 1990s The first half of the 1990s continued this trend with notable players, such as Brett Kenny and Peter Sterling, retiring from the game. Parramatta were completely unable to replace players of this calibre via recruiting and consequently struggled. Coach John Monie departed at the end of the 1989 season and was replaced by Michael Cronin. In 1990, Parramatta finished eighth and Sterling in his last full season won his second Rothmans Medal, but in 1991 and 1992 the club descended in the rankings, only narrowly avoiding the ‚Äúwooden spoon‚Äù in the latter season. In 1993, the Eels finished eleventh after a promising start and then in 1994 under new coach Ron Hilditch, twelfth. 1995 proved the Eels worst season since 1960, with the club finishing second last with only three wins in first grade, last in reserve grade and last in the club championship. Players from this era included current Hull Kingston Rovers coach Justin Morgan, injury-plagued Country Origin representative centre David Woods, Lee Oudenryn (who beat Martin Offiah in a half-time footrace in Great Britain‚Äôs 1992 tour match with ParramattaDavid Middleton (ed.), Rugby League 1992-93, Iron Bark Press, 1993) and former Australian representative Paul Dunn. Other players of this era who would go on to play with other clubs included utility back Chris Lawler (who went to the Gold Coast Chargers), Garen Casey (Penrith Panthers) and Scott Mahon (North Queensland Cowboys). Super League The ‚ÄúSuper League war‚Äù that began in 1995 provided an opportunity for Parramatta to recruit notable players from other clubs. As players and clubs aligned with either the ARL or the Super League competitions, various players became dislodged from their clubs. Parramatta, aligning with the ARL, were able to recruit ARL-aligned players from Super League-aligned clubs. This led to Parramatta signing star players Dean Pay, Jason Smith, Jim Dymock and Jarrod McCracken, from 1995 premiers Canterbury Bulldogs, alongside Aaron Raper and Adam Ritson from Cronulla. Parramatta entered the 1996 season with a squad comprising not only these notable Super League defectors, but also New Zealand international half-back Gary Freeman. However, despite these recruits, the Eels again failed to make the semi-finals. Parramatta spent most of the season in the lower reaches of, or just outside, a finals position. The Eels made a late challenge for final qualification, which included a Round 19 defeat of the Newcastle Knights in front of a home crowd of 21,191 (the largest Parramatta Stadium attendance since 1986). However, the blue and golds lost three consecutive matches to end the season in thirteenth position. The 1997 season saw the recruitment of a new coach, former St George Dragons coach Brian Smith. The appointment of Brian Smith saw a reversal in Parramatta's fortunes with the Club finishing in third place and making the Australian Rugby League semi-finals in 1997 for the first time since 1986. Parramatta lost both its finals matches to Newcastle Knights and North Sydney in the Major Qualifying Final to exit from the series. The same scenario would reoccur in 1998 (4th), 1999 (2nd) and 2000 (7th) with Parramatta failing to qualify for the Grand Final on each occasion. In the 1998 preliminary final Parramatta were leading arch rivals Canterbury 18‚Äì2 with less than 10 minutes to play and then what can only be described as the greatest choke in Rugby League preliminary finals history occurred. Canterbury managed to fight their way back into the match and with a minute left on the scoreboard, winger Daryl Halligan kicked a conversion from out on the far touchline to send the game into extra time. Canterbury won in extra time 32‚Äì20. The loss was hard to take for Parramatta as they had beaten eventual premiers Brisbane twice during the regular season.http://www.nrl.com/top-10-preliminary-final- heartbreaks/tabid/10874/newsid/89986/default.aspxhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/canterbury- bulldogs-parramatta-eels-and-more-the-seven-best-finals-runs-of-the-nrl- era/news-story/007a8a9ede205622095a2ede85839a2d In 1999, Parramatta led Melbourne 16‚Äì0 at halftime in the preliminary final only to lose 18‚Äì16 at full time. Melbourne went on to win the premiership the following week. In the 2000 NRL season, Parramatta finished seventh and won both their sudden death finals matches to take on Brisbane in the preliminary final. In a game that they were not expected to win, Parramatta came close but lost the match against a much stronger Brisbane side. This was their third preliminary final loss in a row.http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/05/15/so-close-yet-so-far-for-parramatta/ During this period, in the wake of the resolution of the Super League War and the creation of the National Rugby League, the competition underwent a major restructure. It was announced that the new competition would comprise only 14 teams out of the 22 who had competed in the two competitions in 1997. This contraction would necessitate mergers or the culling of teams who did not meet the criteria for inclusion into the new competition. Despite meeting these criteria the Parramatta board explored mergers with both Penrith Panthers and Balmain Tigers but opted against the plan.Steve Mascord and Brad Walter, ‚ÄòDouble punt is finally paying off‚Äô, Sydney Morning Herald 24 September, 2005 2000s Parramatta, having recruited half-back Jason Taylor, finished 2001 as minor premiers and qualified for the Grand Final for the first time since 1986. Parramatta won 20 of their regular season matches with the best offensive and defensive record in the season, finishing 5 points clear of the 2nd placed Bulldogs. Parramatta set a regular-season points scoring record in the premiership by scoring 839 points in 26 matches. Playing Newcastle Knights in the Grand Final Parramatta trailed 0‚Äì24 at half-time. Despite a strong second-half performance from the Eels with two tries to both Brett Hodgson and Jamie Lyon the Eels were defeated 30‚Äì24. There are several stories as to why Parramatta were unable to win the match in the years after the game. One such story was that The Parramatta players were \\"Nervous and Stiff\\" and were dressed in Miami Vice suits at the traditional NRL Grand Final Breakfast. Ex- Newcastle player Ben Kennedy recalled the week by saying \\"They came into the game under a shitload of pressure but for us, it was just a good time and a heap of fun. Parra were shitting themselves and we were having a good time\\".http://www.theherald.com.au/story/476921/newcastle-knights- recall-2001-grand-final-glory/ The club qualified for the finals in 2002, finishing sixth, but failed to do so in 2004, finishing ninth. In 2005, the Eels won their second minor premiership but failed to convert the position into another Grand Final appearance losing 29‚Äì0 to The North Queensland Cowboys in the preliminary final in a game that Parramatta was expected to win.http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/cowboys-stun-eels-to-make-grand- final/2005/09/25/1127586741021.html It was announced soon after the disastrous 2005 finals series that coach Brian Smith had been asked to stand down after the conclusion of the 2006 season, to be replaced by Newcastle coach Michael Hagan. After a poor start to the 2006 season, Smith resigned on 15 May 2006 and was replaced by former Eels half-back Jason Taylor. Despite the team's low position on the ladder at the time, the team qualified for the finals in eighth position but were eliminated by minor premiers Melbourne Storm in the first week of the series. In the 2007 season, Parramatta finished 5th on the ladder at the end of the regular season and once again made the preliminary final. This time against The Melbourne Storm. Parramatta lost the match 26‚Äì10. This was their 5th preliminary final loss in 9 years.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-09-02/eels-destroy-broncs-to-take-fifth- spot/657438http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nrl-2007/prelim- final/melbourne-vs-parramatta/summary.html Daniel Anderson was appointed coach at the end of the 2008 NRL season. Midway through the 2009 NRL season the troubled Parramatta Eels club replaced Denis Fitzgerald, then the longest- serving CEO in the competition's history, with Paul Osborne. Parramatta then completed a remarkable turnaround, going on to reach the grand final after sitting in 14th spot on the table after Round 18. They won 10 of their last 12 matches to make the grand final defeating minor premiers The St George Dragons, Gold Coast and Arch-Rivals Canterbury on the way to the final, which they lost to the salary cap rorting Melbourne Storm who later had the title stripped due to the cheating.http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nrl-2009/parramatta/summary.html 2010s For the 2011 NRL Season, Parramatta was managed by new head coach Stephen Kearney. Round 1 saw Parramatta get off to the perfect start by beating The Auckland Warriors 24‚Äì18 at Eden Park in New Zealand. But after that Round 1 victory the rest of 2011 was a very bleak one for Parramatta with the team finishing fourteenth on the ladder of sixteen clubs. Along the way Parramatta went on a 7-game losing streak including a 56‚Äì6 loss to South Sydney. In the final round of the season, Parramatta played against The Gold Coast with the loser almost certainly receiving the wooden spoon. Parramatta won the match 32‚Äì12 and Gold Coast were consigned to the wooden spoon. In 2012, things went from bad to worse at the club as Parramatta finished last for the first time since 1972. Towards the back end of the season, Kearney's contract was terminated and Brad Arthur was installed as caretaker coach. The last insult came in the final match of the season against The St George Dragons as retiring legends Luke Burt & Nathan Hindmarsh both went out as wooden spooners in their final year as players. The only thing memorable to come from the match was a last minute penalty goal kicked by Hindmarsh.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/the-lowdown-eels-v- dragons/news-story/61d45b329cdbd429c77eb55985d9a67a In 2013, Parramatta appointed Ricky Stuart as their new coach on a three-year deal. In the opening round there was a lot of optimism and hope for the future as Parramatta defeated Auckland Warriors 40‚Äì10 at Parramatta Stadium. This result proved to be the highlight of the season as Parramatta finished last again. Along the way Parramatta lost 10 matches in a row including heavy losses to Manly & Canterbury. Mid season, Stuart also announced that as of the end of the season, there would be a massive cull of the playing roster and twelve players were told that their services were no longer required as of next season. In May 2013 Steve Sharp was elected Chairman of the Parramatta Eels board, replacing Roy Spagnolo. On 12 September 2013, Stuart walked out on Parramatta to coach Canberra. On 16 October 2013, Brad Arthur was announced as the new head coach of Parramatta on a 3-year deal.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-12/ricky-stuart-quits-eels-to-link- with-raiders/4952672http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/parramatta- eels-nrl-coach-ricky-stuart-punts-at-least-12-players-for-next-season/news- story/a83519fd3ca11dc4d59373c18da64171http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-16/parramatta- eels-appoint-brad-arthur-as-coach-ahead-of-jason-tay/5026086 The 2014 season started off in great style as Parramatta won 4 out of their first 6 matches. Parramatta then went into their Easter Monday clash at Stadium Australia sitting 5th on the ladder but lost the match controversially 21‚Äì18 in front of 50,000 fans. In round 24 Parramatta were sitting 8th on the ladder and looked destined to play in the finals for the first time since 2009 and only needed to win one of their last two remaining games against sides lower than them on the table which were Canberra and Newcastle. Parramatta lost both matches and missed out on the finals series by two competition points.http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/rugby-league-match- centre/parramatta-eels-v-wests- tigers-20140417-36vfv.htmlhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/knights/parramatta- eels-finals-hopes-hit-by-a-secondhalf-blitz-from-newcastle-knights/news- story/ef379d470227dd9162766cf13a340f3b The 2015 season was a year to forget for Parramatta as they finished twelfth on the table. The highlights being in Round 1 when Parramatta defeated Manly 42-12 and Semi Radradra scoring 24 tries in 18 matches.http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/semi- radradra-breaks-parramatta-eels-tryscoring-record-with-a-controversial-pair- of-tries-20150906-gjgaxg.html The discovery by the NRL in 2016 of salary cap breaches, over a period of four years, resulted in it stripping the Eels of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the 2016 NRL season. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title revoked. On 19 July 2016 the Parramatta Leagues Club board was sacked by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority, and an administrator appointed. This effectively also removed the Eels board as the seven directors on both boards were the same people. Max Donnelly, of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed as administrator. At the time of the 12 point deduction, Parramatta were sitting 5th on the ladder but then found themselves at 14th position. Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22‚Äì20 in a close game. 2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at Parramatta Stadium as it was due to be demolished at seasons end to make way for a new 30,000 seat stadium. The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The St George Illawarra Dragons in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat the Dragons 30‚Äì18. Parramatta's final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The Auckland Warriors. Parramatta won the match 40‚Äì18 with Bevan French scoring 3 tries. At the end of the season, Parramatta finished in 14th place on the ladder but if they had not been stripped of the 12 competition points they would have played in the finals.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-13/souths-break-parramatta-hearts- as-eels-fans-rally-around- club/7414160http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/09/04/new-zealand-warriors-vs- parramatta-eels-nrl-live-scores- blog-3/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-29/bevan-french-parramatta-eels-st- george-illawarra-dragons-nrl/7796414 The 2017 season saw a major turnaround for the club with Parramatta finishing fourth on the table and making the finals for the first time since 2009.

Parramatta led 10‚Äì6 at halftime but went on to lose the match 24‚Äì16 in what would be one of the biggest upsets of the season.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-16/nrl- north-queensland-cowboys-beat-parramatta-eels/8940644 For the 2018 season, Parramatta were predicted by many before the season to finish in the top 8 and challenge for the premiership. Those predictions were matched in the opening round of the season as Parramatta lead Penrith 14-0 early on but after a second half capitulation lost the game 24‚Äì14. In Round 2, Parramatta were humiliated 54-0 by Manly at Brookvale Oval. Parramatta went on to lose the opening 6 games of the season before eventually winning their first game of the season defeating Manly 44‚Äì10 in Round 7. In Round 8, Parramatta defeated Wests 24‚Äì22 to make it back to back victories for the club. The Eels then went on to lose the next 5 games in a row before eventually winning their third game of the season defeating North Queensland 20‚Äì14 in Darwin in which Jarryd Hayne returned from injury scoring two tries. The following weeks were filled with disappointment as the club came close to pulling off upset wins against top of the table St George only for the club to concede two tries in 5 minutes to lose 20-18 and South Sydney after leading 20-6 late into the game only for The Rabbitohs to score late tries and win 26‚Äì20. In Round 18, Parramatta lost 18‚Äì16 to Newcastle with The Eels being denied a last minute try after it was ruled winger Bevan French had put his foot over the sideline. The following week, Parramatta defeated arch rivals Canterbury 14‚Äì8 in what the media dubbed the \\"Spoon Bowl\\". There were hopes that Parramatta could avoid the wooden spoon as going into the second last game of the season the club sat above North Queensland on the table due to for and against. In what was the retiring Jonathan Thurston's final home game, both clubs needed a win to avoid the wooden spoon. North Queensland won the match 44‚Äì6. In the final game of the season, Parramatta were defeated 44-10 by Eastern Suburbs ensuring that the club finished last and claimed their 14th wooden spoon and The Roosters claiming the minor premiership. Before the match, Easts needed to defeat Parramatta by 27 points to overtake Melbourne and finish first on the table.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/eels/parramatta- eels-season-2018-review-peter-sterlings-biggest-fear-after-horror- campaign/news-story/14f79c1c637fa8d03bbfa6d6b63b55f1 https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/03/expert-predictions-for-nrl-top-eight- in-2018/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-28/nrl-st-george-illawarra-edge- out-paramatta/9914596 Before the start of the 2019 NRL season, Parramatta were predicted by many to finish towards the bottom of the table or claim another wooden spoon. The club started off the year with back to back victories over Penrith and arch rivals Canterbury-Bankstown. In Round 6 of the 2019 NRL season, Parramatta played their first game at the new Western Sydney Stadium against the Wests Tigers and ran out 51-6 winners in front of a sold-out crowd. In Round 9 against Melbourne, Parramatta suffered one of their worst ever defeats losing 64‚Äì10 at Suncorp Stadium. In the aftermath of the defeat, coach Brad Arthur and the players were placed under intense scrutiny but just a week after the loss, Arthur was given a two-year contract extension by the Parramatta board. The club would then go on to lose against North Queensland and last placed Penrith in the coming weeks. Between Round 12 and Round 22 of the 2019 season, Parramatta would go on to win 8 of their 10 games. In Round 22 against the Gold Coast Titans, Parramatta qualified for the 2019 finals series with a 36‚Äì12 victory at Cbus Super Stadium. At the end of the 2019 regular season, Parramatta finished 5th on the table and qualified for the finals. In the elimination final against Brisbane, Parramatta won the match 58‚Äì0 at the new Western Sydney Stadium. The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55‚Äì7 win over St George in 1944. The match was also Parramatta's biggest win over Brisbane and Brisbane's worst ever loss since entering the competition in 1988.

It is responsible for reviewing and advising the Victorian Government on consumer legislation and industry codes; advising and educating consumers, tenants, traders and landlords on their rights, responsibilities and changes to the law; registering and licensing businesses and occupations; conciliating disputes between consumers and traders, tenants and landlords; and enforcing and ensuring compliance with consumer laws. It is a business unit of the Department of Justice and Community Safety. Consumer Affairs Victoria provides information and advice on issues including renting, buying and selling property, building, shopping, motor car trading, small businesses and clubs and not-for-profits. It licenses or registers (in conjunction with the Business Licensing Authority) and regulates a range of occupations, including conveyancers, estate agents, motor car traders, owners corporation managers, sex work service providers, second-hand dealers and pawnbrokers.  History and establishment  In 1965, the State Government of Victoria established a Consumer Protection Council, the first government general consumer body established in Australia Consumer Affairs Victoria 2007 Lecture: Consumer Affairs; Past, Present and Future Lecture presented in Honour of Mr Norm Geschke OBE by Dr David Cousins, Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria, 13 March 2007. The Consumer Protection Council was established essentially to consider issues and to advise the Government. The Council was not formally set up to handle complaints, but this became a dominant part of its work. New legislation in 1973 also established a Ministry of Consumer Affairs tied to the Department of Labour and Industry. They were substantially cut by the Kennett Government and the Ministry was abolished and absorbed into a new Department of Justice.  Goals and purpose  The Consumer Affairs Victoria vision is \\"informed and responsible consumers and traders, who know their rights and responsibilities\\"Consumer Affairs Victoria Annual Report 2007-2008 , pages 4-5, published by the Victorian Government Printer, October 2008. Its goals are: * Empower consumers * Create a competitive, fair, and safe trading environment * Protect vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers * Optimise our organisational capability.  Activities and operations  A past Director of Consumer Affairs, Dr David Cousins, described the role of Consumer Affairs Victoria thus: \\"Consumer Affairs has essentially three key roles. These are firstly to advise the government on the consumer policy framework and to manage the legislative and non-legislative program related to this framework. Secondly, Consumer Affairs is a significant regulator of industry conduct, monitors entry regulation in some industries, and manages guarantee funds covering residential tenancies, property services and motor car trading. Thirdly, Consumer Affairs is a major service provider of information, advice, education, complaint-handling (primarily through the provision of third party conciliation and mediation services) and licensing services.\\"  Organisation  Consumer Affairs Victoria is a component of the Regulation business unit of the Victorian Department of Justice and Community Safety.Department of Justice website: \\"Our Executive\\".

The Nigrodharama is located at the site of the modern Kudan village, about six kilometres south of Tilaurakot, the citadel of Kapilavastu. The precise location of Nigrodharama is at the following coordinates: . Events at the Nigrodharama It was at the Nigrodharama that MahƒÅpajƒÅpati Gotamƒ´ first asked permission for women to enter the Order. This was refused, and from there the Buddha went on to VesƒÅli.Vin.ii.253; A.iv.274 The Buddha stayed at the NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma on several occasions, and several Vinaya rules are mentioned as being first promulgated there.E.g., Vin.iii.235, 244; iv.55, 101, 167, 181, 262, 314 Various SƒÅkyans came to see the Buddha at the NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma, among them, MahƒÅnƒÅma, Godha, SarakƒÅni, Nandiya and Vappa.S.v.369 78; 395 7, 403 4, 408; A.ii.196; iii.284; iv.220; v. 83, 328, 332, 334 The Buddha himself visited KƒÅligodhƒÅ during his residence there. It was during a discussion with MahƒÅnƒÅma that the Cula Dukkhakkhandha Sutta was preached. During one of the Buddha's residences in NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma, the SƒÅkyans invited him to consecrate their new Mote Hall, which he did by preaching there far into the night and then asking MoggallƒÅna to continue his discourse.S.iv.182ff.; also M.i.353, Sekha Sutta On another occasion the Buddha is mentioned as having spent a period of convalescence at NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma;A.i.219f he was there also when the quarrel broke out between the SƒÅkyans and the Koliyans regarding the water of the Rohinƒ´SNA.i.357; but see J.v.413, where he is said to have been in SƒÅvatthi). It seems to have been the Buddha's custom, when staying at NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma, sometimes to spend the noonday siesta in the MahƒÅvana (Great Forest) nearby.E.g., S.iii.91f The remains of a second (slightly smaller) stupa at the Nigrodharama Among others mentioned as having stayed at NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma are AnuruddhaDhA.iii.295 and Lomasakangiya;M.iii.200 a deva called Candana there taught him the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. This Lomasakangƒ´ya might be the same as Lomavangƒ´sa, who is also mentionedS.v.327 as having lived in NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma? Near NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma was once the site of the dwelling of a hermit (isi) called Kanha. The Buddha, remembering this, once smiled, and, when asked the reason for his smile, related the Kanha JƒÅtaka (J.iv.6). There is a traditionCypA.1,7; BuA.3 that the Cariya Pitaka and the Buddhavamsa were preached by the Buddha to Sariputta during his first stay in NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma. It was probably there that Anuruddha's sister built, at his request, an assembly hall of two storeys for the Sangha.DhA.iii.295f Buddhaghosa saysMA.ii.906; M.iii.109f that KƒÅla Khemaka, the SƒÅkyan, built a special vihƒÅra near NigrodhƒÅrƒÅma, on one side of the grounds. Current remains of the Nigrodharama The remains of the Nigrodharama are currently called Kudan, because it is located close to Kudan village. The remains consist of two (excavated) large stupas, and a third as yet unexcavated one. The third (unexcavated) stupa has a more recent (possibly Islamic) structure built on top of it.

Using contrast injected into the blood vessels, images are created to look for blockages, aneurysms (dilations of walls), dissections (tearing of walls), and stenosis (narrowing of vessel). CTA can be used to visualize the vessels of the heart, the aorta and other large blood vessels, the lungs, the kidneys, the head and neck, and the arms and legs. Medical uses CTA can be used to examine blood vessels in many key areas of the body including the brain, kidneys, pelvis, and the lungs. Coronary CT angiography Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the use of CT angiography to assess the arteries of the heart. The patient receives an intravenous injection of contrast and then the heart is scanned using a high speed CT scanner. With the advances in CT technology, patients are typically able to be scanned without needing medicines by simply holding their breath during the scan. CTA is used to assess heart or vessel irregularities, location of stents and whether they are still open, and occasionally to check for atherosclerotic disease. This method displays the anatomical detail of blood vessels more precisely than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound. Today, many patients can undergo CTA in place of a conventional catheter angiogram, a minor procedure during which a catheter is passed through the blood vessels all the way to the heart, however CCTA has not fully replaced this procedure. CCTA is able to detect narrowing of blood vessels in time for corrective therapy to be done. CCTA is a useful way of screening for arterial disease because it is safer, much less time- consuming than catheter angiography, and is also a cost-effective procedure.  Aorta and great arteries  CTA can be used in the chest and abdomen to identify aneurysms in the aorta or other major blood vessels. These areas of weakened blood vessel walls that bulge out can life-threatening if they rupture. CTA is the test of choice when assessing aneurysm before and after endovascular stenting due to the ability to detect calcium within the wall. Another positive of CTA in abdominal aortic aneurysm assessment is it allows for better estimation of blood vessel dilation and can better detect blood clots as compared to standard angiography. CTA is used also to identify arterial dissection, including aortic dissection in the aorta or its major branches. Arterial dissection is when the layers of the artery wall peel away from each other; this causes pain and can be life-threatening. CTA is a quick and non-invasive method of identifying dissections and can show the extent of the disease and if there is leakage.  Pulmonary arteries  CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is used to examine the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, most commonly to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), a serious but treatable condition. It has become the technique of choice for detection of pulmonary embolism due to its wide availability, short exam time, ability to see other diseases that may present like pulmonary embolisms, and a high degree of confidence in the validity of the test. In this test, a PE will appear as a dark spot inside the blood vessel or a sudden stop of the bright contrast material. CT angiography should not be used to evaluate for pulmonary embolism when other tests indicate that there is a low probability of a person having this condition., which cites * * * A D-dimer assay might be a preferred alternative to test for pulmonary embolism, and that test and a low clinical prediction score on the Wells test or Geneva score can exclude pulmonary embolism as a possibility.  Renal arteries  Volume rendered CTA of renal arteries in patient with medial fibromuscular dysplasia. Visualization of blood flow in the renal arteries (those supplying the kidneys) in patients with high blood pressure and those suspected of having kidney disorders can be performed using CTA. Stenosis (narrowing) of a renal artery is a cause of hypertension (high blood pressure) in some patients and can be corrected. A special computerized method of viewing the images makes renal CT angiography a very accurate examination. CTA is also used in the assessment of native and transplant renal arteries. While CTA is great for imaging of the kidneys, it lacks the ability to perform procedures at the same time. Thus traditional catheter angiography is used in cases of acute renal hemorrhage or acute arterial obstruction.  Carotid, vertebral and intracranial vessels  CTA of a vascular malformation with intraventricular hemorrhage. CTA can be used assess acute stroke patients by identifying clots in the arteries of the brain. It can also be used to identify small aneurysms or arteriovenous malformation inside the brain that can be life-threatening. While CTA can produce high quality images of the carotid arteries for grading the level of stenosis (narrowing of the vessel), calcium deposits (calcified plaques) in the area where the vessels split can lead to interference with accurate stenosis grading. Because of this, magnetic resonance angiography is used more often for this purpose.  Peripheral arteries  CTA can be used in the legs to detect atherosclerotic disease that has narrowed the arteries. It can also be used to image vessels in suspected blockages, trauma cases, or patients with surgical complications. Technique In 436x436px CT angiography is a contrast CT where images are taken with a certain delay after injection of radiocontrast material. The contrast material is radiodense causing it to light up brightly within the blood vessels of interest. In order for the CT scanner to be able to scan the correct area where the contrast is, the scanner uses either automatic detectors which start scanning when enough contrast is present, or small test boluses. With the small test bolus, a small amount of contrast is injected in order to detect the speed that the contrast will move through the blood vessels. After determining this speed, the full bolus is injected and the scan is begun at the timing determined by the test bolus. After the scan is completed the images are post-processed to better visualize the vessels and can even be created in the 3D images. Risks Harms of overuse of CT angiography include radiation exposure and the possibility of finding then seeking treatment for a clinically insignificant pulmonary embolism which ought not be treated.  Adverse reactions  A reaction may occur whenever iodine contrast is injected. These reactions range in severity and it is difficult to predict if they will occur. With the current practice of using low-osmolar contrast these adverse reactions only occur in ~0.1% of cases. The severity of the reaction can be broken down into three groups: * Mild - no treatment required: nausea, vomiting, and/or hives. * Moderate - requires treatment: severe hives, lightheadedness or brief loss of consciousness, mild bronchospasm, and/or increased heart rate. * Severe - requires immediate treatment: severe bronchospasm, throat swelling, seizure, severe low blood pressure, and/or cardiac arrest. A patient with a history of allergy to contrast may be advised to take medications such as corticosteroids or histamine (H1) blockers before CTA to lessen the risk of allergic reaction or to undergo a different exam that does not call for contrast material injection. Patients should also be well hydrated in order to minimize possible adverse effects of contrast. Contrary to popular belief there is no correlation between seafood allergies and reactions to iodine contrast, as shown by many recent studies.  Kidneys  Historically it has been thought that contrast material can lead to contrast-induced nephropathy (also called CIN) in any patient. However, recent studies have shown that the risk of kidney injury caused by contrast agent in patients with no history of kidney problems occurs extremely infrequently. The use of CTA in people with kidney failure, kidney disease or long-standing severe diabetes should be weighed carefully as the use of IV iodine contrast material may further harm kidney function. The decision not to use contrast agents must be weighed against the possibility of misdiagnoses if contrast is not used.  Radiation  Compared with other imaging modalities, CTA is associated with a significant dose of ionizing radiation. Depending on patient age and exam protocol, CTA may cause a considerable increase in lifetime cancer risk. However, there are many clinical situations for which the benefits of performing the procedure outweigh this risk. CT angiography should not be performed in patients who are pregnant as the contrast and radiation may lead to harm to the fetus. The extent of harm to the fetus has not been fully determined. History By 1994 CT angiography began to replace conventional angiography in diagnosing and characterizing most cardiovascular abnormalities. Prior to this, conventional angiography had been in use for 70 years.

His book Counselling in Male Infertility was published in 1996; he contributed to major newspaper articles and appeared on several current affairs television programmes. He was the \\"inspiration\\" for Anthony Ling, the character in the novel One Life by Rebecca Frayn (Simon & Schuster 2006, ), after the author herself sought Lee's help for IVF treatment. In 2010, Willing to Die for It, Lee's biography by Frances Lynn was published by Murray Print. Lee died suddenly on 21 July 2012. Current research Lee's interests lay in the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. He was a visiting professor at the University College London where he collaborated with various groups in the Anatomy Department examining the potential of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to give rise to neuronal/glial lineages in response to various growth factors and tissue culture manipulations. He also taught ethics of biomedicine at University College London. In addition, he was interested in tissue engineering and teaching ethics in reproduction. He was attached to the Jessen-Mirsky laboratory and was studying remyelination. Lee had ethical committee approval in Brasil for creating artificial gametes from umbilical cord blood derived stem cells. It is hoped these will be used to overcome infertility. Official UCL page Biography Lee originally researched his Ph.D. at UCL under the supervision of Professor Ricardo Miledi FRS in the school of Sir Bernard Katz. The School of Sir Bernard Katz Lee was also a signatory to a memento presented to Sir Bernard Katz on his 80th birthday from bona fide members of the school-occasion when the phrase \\"School of Katz\\" was coined. Lee provided an anecdote about Sir Bernard Katz and Ricardo Miledi. Published by CESI Lee first published research in Neuroscience during the 1980s (from the Biophysics department at UCL), having worked on nerve muscle interaction ranging from examining TTX-resistant action potentials in denervated muscle to studying cholinesterase activity in dissociated adult muscle fibres following up on the work first done in the same department by Bill Betz and Bert Sakmann. Lee changed his focus to embryos, when he realised that many of the questions framed by his Neuroscience research were rooted in the matter of differentiation. The ultimate undifferentiated cell is the fertilised egg. This led Lee to work on gap junctions in early mammalian embryos (in the Anatomy & Embryology department at UCL), where work with Anne Warner FRS and Anne McLaren DBE FRS produced new information on factors affecting communication between cells and their developmental potential. Lee became a clinical embryologist in 1985, when working with the gynaecologist Ian CraftThe Daily Telegraph Letter from Ian Craft when he and Sammy Lee worked at the Wellington he directed the IVF laboratory at the Wellington Hospital in London, then one of the largest units in the world. Consultancy work with the UK division of Ares Serono (1986‚Äì1994) also involved work with the Bourn Hallam Group, which Patrick Steptoe and Bob Edwards had set up after Louise Brown's birth. From 1995 to 2002 he was based at the Portland Hospital for Women & Children.Official UCL page Dr Sammy Lee, Scientific Director of the Portland Hospital, David McConnell, Professor of Genetics at TCD, and David Quinn, Editor of the Irish Catholic, discuss the issue Lee latterly became based again at UCL. He was interested in tissue engineering and teaching ethics in reproduction. He was working on tissue engineering and stem cells mainly concerned with background research on Stem cells and Progenitor cells. Dr. Lee also had a keen interest in ethics and expressed this at UCL by running a course titled \\"Ethics of Fertility and Embryo Research\\". His students remarked him to be knowledgeable in the field of ethics and enthusiastic; they had particularly noted that he is clearly a fan of Kant. He had previously served as an international editor of the Brazilian Journal of Assisted Reproduction. He served as a Trustee and director of several charities. His curriculum vitae lists numerous scientific publications. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Health (now Royal Society for Public Health) and the Royal Society of Medicine, both in 1987.UCL Staff Page (1987) Lee was FRSM and FRSH. He was inducted to Fellowship of RSH (now RSPH) and RSM. Lee's team at the Wellington pioneered the first UK practise of gamete Intra-fallopian Transfer (GIFT), The GIFT of Life (a technique invented by Ricardo Asch in the USA). The team was the second to carry out GIFT and then proceeded to post the largest series in the world in 1986. Lee also helped perform some of the first egg donations in the UK, when directing the Wellington Hospital IVF Laboratory. Lee pioneered a simple inexpensive efficient form of Mechanical Assisted Hatching in the UK. He produced the world's first intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI with NASBA virus assay) virus free baby to an HIV discordant couple. Lee had many media appearances having been on many TV shows as well as writing a number of newspapers articles .

The studio time was free of charge, since the owner was curious about the MSB's music, which was so radically different at the time.

After the death of Mastana Balochistani, his movement was split into three groups, with Satnam Singh leading the Sirsa group, who selected Gurmeet Ram Rahim to be his successor. Dera Sacha Sauda's main centre is situated in the city of Sirsa in Haryana state, northern India.Largest Blood Donation. Guinness Book of World Records The organisation has 46 ashrams (divisions) across India and other countries. Under the leadership of Mastana Balochistani, 25 Ashrams were established in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, where Naam method of Meditation was taught to the followers who accepted three principles for the rest of their life: No consumption of meat, egg or gelatin, no consumption of alcohol, drugs, tobacco etc. and no adultery or illicit sex.

The Life of His Holiness Shah Satnam Singh Ji Maharaj He was succeeded by controversial Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in 1990, who added more than a dozen ashrams and made Dera a much more visible organization. The current leader, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who himself claims to have more than 60 million followers worldwide, is a controversial figure in India and was accused of murder and convicted of rape. On 25 August 2017, a special CBI court in the city of Panchkula, Haryana, found him guilty of raping two Dera sadhvis (female followers). Subsequently, the special CBI court sentenced Singh for a period of 20-year prison term on 28 August 2017. History Dera Sacha Sauda was established in 1948 at Sirsa by Mastana Balochistani. He was born in Kalat, Balochistan in undivided India, now in Pakistan in 1891. He was popularly known among his devotees as His Holiness Beparawah Mastana Ji Maharaj. He died on 18 April 1960. Shah Satnam Singh, born on 25 January 1919 took over the spiritual leadership position from Balochistani at the age of 41 and served until 1990. He died on 13 December 1991. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh became the third master of DSS on 23 September 1990. DSS is a registered NGO.  2007 clashes with Khalsa Sikhs  In May 2007, violent clashes broke out between the Khalsa Sikhs and the followers of the Dera Sacha Sauda over the Dera leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's appearance in a newspaper advertisement. The orthodox Sikhs alleged that he had impersonated their Guru Gobind Singh, thus insulting their faith. At least one person died in these clashes; several more were injured. The news media described the violence as the most serious since the Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clashes of the 1970s and the separatist insurgency of the 1980s. The Akal Takht of the Sikhs demanded closure of all the Deras in Punjab, and asked its followers to organise protest marches and bandhs. Ultimately, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh issued an namesake apology. However, this apology was rejected by the Akal Takht. The marches and boycotts against the Dera continued, until the situation subsided after several weeks.  2017 Conviction and subsequent riots  Its leader, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, was accused of murder and convicted of rape by an Indian court. On 25 August 2017, a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Panchkula, Haryana, found him guilty of sexually assaulting two Dera sadhvis (female followers), one of whom had written to the then prime minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee about it in 2002. More than 150,000 followers of DSS had gathered at Panchkula, where the hearing was taking place, and a few other places. Upon learning of the court's verdict, they were involved in a mass riot which led to the death of at least 30 people and left more than 250 people seriously injured. The Punjab and Haryana High Court ordered all of DSS's properties to be attached to pay for the losses incurred due to the violence. A few incidents were reported in the Indian capital, New Delhi, which is away from the epicentre. The incident led to widespread criticism of the ruling government, in that, despite the high court's repeated warnings, it failed to gauge the severity of the situation, and failed to enforce Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The latter prohibits an assembly of any more than four people, and was in effect at the time of the verdict. Allegedly 400 followers of the sect have been castrated inside the sect‚Äôs headquarters to \\"bring them closer to god\\". One of the castrated men came forward and filed a complaint in court against the guru. According to India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the sect defended castrations as done to \\"safeguard female followers from possible sexual advances\\". On 4 September 2017, after receiving a 2-day notice from police to surrender weapons, DSS members turned in 67 firearms, almost half of which were licensed. Police confiscated 33 of the weapons.  Teachings  The Dera's teachings emphasise the recitation of sacred words and the achievement of transcendence. The devotees are asked to practice alcohol abstinence, vegetarianism, marital fidelity, and truth. They are also asked to abstain from ritualism and from making monetary religious donations (see Funding). During the satsang gatherings, the Guru of the Dera sits beneath Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and Christian symbols organised in a way that depicts him as the union of these religions.  Membership  All the Dera Sacha Sauda Gurus have come from Sikh backgrounds, and the organisation has several Sikh adherents. However, the vast majority of its supporters are working-class and middle- class Hindus from the rural areas of Haryana and Rajasthan. In 2009, the Dera Sacha Sauda claimed to have over a million devotees. It had 38 ashrams, most of them in northern India.  Funding  The word \\"Dera\\" is similar connotations to \\"ashram\\", while the word \\"Sacha Sauda\\" means \\"true deal\\" - a reference to the claim that the organisation does not accept monetary gifts from its devotees. The Dera Sacha Sauda claims to be autarkic: it owns extensive lands in Haryana and other states; and operates a supermarket, a petrol pump, a biscuit factory, a restaurant, and a boating lake. These businesses, managed by its \\"sadhus,\\" are said to be for the benefit of its devotees. Political activities Dera Sacha Sauda is the only among the various Deras, which openly asks its supporters to vote for particular political parties. The previous Congress government enjoyed the organisation's support and it reciprocated by providing a Z-plus security cover for the group's leader. Singh's son is married to the daughter of the Congress leader Harminder Singh Jassi. The DSS supported Congress in the 2007 Punjab state elections, and helped the party take control of the Malwa region. However, the Shiromani Akali Dal won the overall majority in the state, and allegedly persecuted the Dera supporters during the 2007 violence. When the Congress did not come out in the open support of DSS, the DSS decided not to endorse a single party in the 2009 parliamentary elections. Instead, it supported particular candidates from both Akali Dal and Congress. Before the 2012 Punjab state elections, the Congress leader Amarinder Singh, his wife Preneet Kaur and his son Raninder Singh visited Singh, asking him to extend his support to Congress. However, Dera's support to Congress alienated the party's Sikh vote bank. In the 2012 elections, Congress performed poorly, and Jassi lost the election. The poor performance of Congress in Malwa in 2012 was seen as a signal of the downfall of Dera's political power. In 2014 Haryana polls and Lok Sabha Polls, Bharatiya Janata Party requested support from Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim. In February 2015, the organisation openly supported BJP in Delhi elections. The organisation supported BJP in the Bihar assembly election in 2015, and nearly 3,000 Dera followers campaigned for BJP in the state. Welfare activities Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh formed a welfare and disaster relief organisation called Shah Satnam Ji Green-S Welfare Force, which now has more than 70,000 doctors, engineers, rescuers, paramedics, and tradesmen participating. The organisation has rendered aid during many of India's natural disasters like Kolkata fire and the factory collapse in Jalandhar. During the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand, a team of volunteers and doctors provided medical care to people, distributed food packets and conducted rescue missions. The area of Deoli-Brahmgram village which was called a 'village of widows' after the floods are still facing issues of hardship, the life of widows at a standstill. Anti-prostitution initiatives began in November 2009, when Singh called on his followers to counter prostitution, and to help sex- workers escape a \\"life of perpetual slavery\\". In December 2009, Dera and its volunteers took a step towards reducing sex trafficking in the country and also preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS virus, by giving consent for marriage with adult sex workers and to \\"help them escape their dreary existence\\". In January 2010, a mass marriage ceremony for former sex workers took place in Sirsa. Dera Sacha Sauda's 400-bed multi-specialty hospital was inaugurated by Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in Sirsa in March 2014 and was named Shah Satnam ji Speciality Hospital. Dera Sacha Sauda had launched a social welfare campaign and had filed a petition in the Supreme Court to grant legal status to transgender people. On 15 April 2014 the Apex Court gave a judgement in favour of the Eunuchs and ordered that the hijras and transgender people will now be given the legal status of the third gender. DSS also initiated a series of sanitation drives and as of 2016, about 30 Mega Cleanliness Campaigns have been conducted in several states of India and also in other countries.  Blood donation camps  Like several other religious groups in India, the Dera Sacha Sauda has organised large-scale blood donation camps. In December 2003, a camp held on the death anniversary of its former guru attracted 15,432 donors. In October 2004, the Dera broke its own record during the mortuary ceremony of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's father. This time it attracted 17,921 donors, and collected 12,002,450 ml units of blood in a single day. This was recognised by the Guinness World Records as the largest ever amount of blood collected on a single day. The official publication of Dera Sacha Sauda claims that the world record was created by \\"sheer chance\\", thus denying the suggestions that it was a show-off for media attention and the glorification of their guru. However, in 2003, the Dera had sent an e-mail to the Guinness Book compilers, seeking clarifications on the conditions that needed to be met to break the previous record. During the donation exercise, the Dera had meticulously collected proofs needed to qualify for the world record. After creating the record, several Dera devotees also stated that their aim was to create the record. Doctors have criticised the \\"ostentatious\\" mass blood donation camps organised by Dera Sacha Sauda as wasteful. According to the director of the Shiv Shakti blood bank in Sirsa, most of the blood collected in Dera's camps gets wasted. Moreover, the devotees don't respond to the blood bank's requests for blood donations at other times, when there is need for blood donation.

The show began as a 30-minute series expanding to 90 minutes in the 1960s, but the other stations along the Avco Network in nearby Dayton, Columbus and Indianapolis only ran 60 minutes of the show. Pre-recorded episodes were sold to other markets throughout the Midwest. The show was originally co-hosted by Bonnie Lou and Marian Spelman, who was later replaced with Colleen Sharp. The house band, originally called The Bel-Aires, was led by pianist Bruce Brownfield. Early beginnings Dixon originally hosted a show on rival station WCPO-TV with Dottie Mack and Wanda Lewis called Paul Dixon's Song Shop. The show consisted of Dixon, Mack, and Lewis pantomiming to popular songs of the day, and also featured in-house commercials. Fresh from a career in radio news, Dixon quickly endeared himself to countless viewers for years to come. Song Shop was picked up for a season by ABC in 1951 and by the DuMont Television Network in 1954. For the DuMont show he moved to New York City, but as DuMont began to collapse in 1955, a homesick Dixon returned to Cincinnati a year later and, in a fateful move, hired on at WLWT. While Dixon was at WCPO, Al Lewis (rapidly gaining fame in his own right as Uncle Al) was in charge of set design and artwork on Dixon's show. After Dixon moved to WLWT, The Paul Dixon Show and The Uncle Al Show would run opposite of each other on weekday mornings. ‚ÄùThis Dumb Show‚Äù By 1955, Dixon was hired on at WLWT to host a daytime show originally geared to housewives, but ultimately appealed to people in all walks of life. Over time Dixon himself would refer to the program as \\"this dumb show\\". Every morning the show would start with Paul, using a pair of binoculars (one of what would become many of Dixon‚Äôs trademarks), to examine what came to be called ‚ÄúKneesville‚Äù, which consisted of ladies sitting in the front row, all wearing either short skirts or ‚Äúhot pants‚Äù. He would then award the best looking knees by either putting a garter on the lady's leg, or attaching a \\"knee tickler\\" to the hem of her skirt. Some of his other trademarks included, but were not limited to: *His nickname. Everyone who knew Dixon or watched his show took to calling him \\"Paul Baby\\". (Dixon acquired the nickname from a prop boy, Al Bischof, who replied to a request by Dixon saying, \\"Okay, Paul Baby!\\" The nickname stuck with Dixon for the rest of his life.) *A spray bottle, used to spritz the audience upon asking how many of them took a bath that morning, which was usually a segue into a commercial for bath soap. *Dixon would strike a \\"runway pose\\" during a shampoo or hair care commercial (or some instance that might require him to take off his jacket), and the band played the first few bars of A Pretty Girl is Like A Melody. *By the 70s, Dixon had taken to giving T-shirts to ladies in the audience, with Dixon putting them on the ladies himself, doing it in such a way that would work itself into an embrace between the two. *On almost every show, Dixon would give an Osherwicz Kosher Salami to at least one member of the audience (usually a lady) after chatting with them or when they gave him something. (David Letterman would later incorporate a variation of this into his own show, instead giving canned hams to people in the audience for their participation in a skit.) *At the mere mention of the word \\"letters\\" (referring to fan mail), Bruce Brownfield and the Band played a quick rendition of the song I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself A Letter. Despite the fact that Dixon did basically the same thing every day, viewers would continually watch his show, many of them admitting, often with varying degrees of embarrassment, that they were 'hooked' on Paul Baby. Guest appearances by celebrities were a rarity at best. Among those who did make appearances were comedian Imogene Coca, actor David McCallum, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and even Bob Hope showed up on occasion. Hope was close friends with Dixon and wrote the foreword for Dixon's first book. Classic moments Besides in-house commercials, a musical number from the house band, a song each from Colleen and Bonnie, and occasionally a song from Dixon himself, who swore he couldn't sing to save his own life, the show was primarily Paul talking with members of his audience, or reading letters from his viewers, both of which often resulted in hilarious situations: *On the day of the Chicken Wedding, a lady in the audience told Dixon of her female neighbor's TV set having broken the night before. Her husband, who worked nights, got home in time to watch Dixon's show, so she wanted to tell him on the air to go next door to invite her neighbor over so the two could watch the show together. She finished by telling them, again on the air, to ‚Äúbe good and be careful‚Äù. *Dixon once read a letter on the air from a farmer in Arkansas who had gotten ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on the show while sick in bed (According to the letter, the farmer's illness had been brought on by bad whiskey); his wife had also gotten hooked shortly afterward. When Dixon called the farmer and talked to him live on the air, he asked Dixon to send him one of the T-shirts he gave to the ladies on his show so he could put it on his wife. The farmer later made an in-person appearance on the show. *On upper management suggestion, Dixon held a \\"Mystery Voice Contest\\", in which he would call a number selected at random from the phone book. If there was an answer on the other end, Dixon played a pre-recorded voice for them to identify, winning a large prize if correct. The first voice was Ralph Lazarus, then-CEO of Federated Department Stores. After a huge promotion and build-up to Day 1 of the contest, the very first contestant Dixon called and played the voice for (keep in mind that he chose the number at random from the phone book) immediately guessed Ralph Lazarus. In disbelief, Dixon asked how the player, a lady, could possibly have known Lazarus' voice; she laughingly replied she used to be his private secretary! *In the early 1950s, when Dixon's producer John Smith contracted polio, Dixon started a campaign for Smith to receive get well cards and over the course of a year Smith received thousands of cards from across the country. Unfortunately, Smith died from polio complications in 1954. While Dixon's antics by today's standards might be construed as chauvinistic or even over-the-top sexist, there was an unspoken understanding between Dixon and his audience (both in-studio and at home) that dictated that he was only going for the laughs and cheers that the antics generated. (Dixon was happily married with two children.) David Letterman credits Paul Dixon for inspiring his choice of career as talk-show host. Dixon's pet expressions *\\"This is the most beautiful, youngest group we've ever had on this television show!\\" (usually said right before grabbing his binoculars to check out Kneesville) *Hold it, we've got a live one here, Gordy!\\" (referring to someone in the audience who had something to say to Dixon. \\"Gordy\\" was director Gordon Waltz) *(singing) \\"...and the angels lit the candles!\\" *\\"Isn't this the dumbest television show you ever saw in your life???\\" *\\"How come you're not at home watching Uncle Al??\\" (Dixon sometimes asked this of kids who appeared on the show) The chicken wedding Harry & Pauline from the Chicken Wedding At one point a fan had sent Dixon a rubber chicken as a souvenir. He took to calling the chicken Pauline, using it/her as a prop when he did commercials for Kroger, saying \\"Kroger has a special on chicken\\", and then invariably tossing it/her over his shoulder. Another fan sent him an additional rubber chicken which Dixon took to calling Harry, who became a \\"companion\\" for Pauline. Over time people began to ask if Dixon was going to marry the feathered couple. Dixon was initially against the idea, but as more and more people, including WLWT boss John Murphy, continued to ask when he would perform the \\"Chicken Wedding\\", Dixon finally capitulated, and in so doing made television history. On Tuesday, March 11, 1969, Dixon staged the first ever wedding for two rubber chickens complete with all the trimmings. The wedding itself was broadcast live on the show, and featured then-WLWT news anchor Tom Atkins narrating and Bob Braun as Best Man, with co- hosts Bonnie Lou and Sharp as matrons of honor. Marian Spelman, still at WLWT appearing on other shows, made a guest appearance singing a humorous version of A Bird in a Gilded Cage. People actually stayed home from work and school to watch the Chicken Wedding live. It went on to become the highest-rated episode in the show's history, and to this day WLWT gets more requests and questions about this particular episode than any other show in the station's near-70 year history. Live at the Ohio State Fair Beginning in 1966 on a request from then-Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes, The Paul Dixon Show (and other local shows on WLWT) began making annual visits to the Ohio State Fair, broadcasting their shows live on location. The following year attendance at the state fair increased by an estimated 1.2 million.Friedman, Jim (2007). \\"Images Of America: Cincinnati Television\\", page 98. Arcadia Publishing, The live shows at the fair continued well into the 1970s. By the end of the 1960s, nearly 600,000 people had been a part of Dixon's studio audience,Dixon, Paul (1968), Paul Baby: Confessions.. page 70 (by comparison, this figure is nearly twice the 2006 population of Cincinnati proper), and Dixon had given away upwards of 3,000 Osherwicz Kosher Salamis.Dixon, Paul (1968), Paul Baby: Confessions.., page 21 At the show's peak there was a two-year waiting list for tickets. Sponsors and commercials Most of Dixon's show consisted of live commercials, performed mainly by Dixon himself, but also by one of the ladies on occasion. Dixon shunned the use of scripts when doing commercials, much to the perpetual delight of his audience. In the tradition of Ruth Lyons, any product plugged by Dixon became the product to use. *When Dixon did commercials for Bounty paper towels, he would always mention they were made in Green Bay, Wisconsin, at which point the band would launch into a quick chorus of the Wisconsin Fight Song. *Dixon was also one of the first to jump on the bandwagon plugging what was then called Pringle's Newfangled Potato Chips, largely because they were invented in Montgomery, Ohio, near Cincinnati. For levity, Bonnie and Colleen often made duck bills out of them. *In the early 70s, Dixon was among the first to sell Orville Redenbacher‚Äôs Gourmet Popcorn. During the commercial, the director would superimpose Redenbacher's face (as it looked on the jar) over Dixon's while he would talk about the product.

Goldsbrough was born in Shipley, Yorkshire, the only son of Joshua Goldsbrough, a butcher, and his wife Hannah, n√©e Speight. At 14 years of age Goldsbrough was apprenticed to a Bradford firm and became a wool stapler. Goldsbrough began working for himself in a small way in 1842, purchasing clips and sorting them for the manufacturers. His business was prospering, but feeling that Australia offered him a wider field, he sailed from Liverpool in 1847, leaving his wife in England, and after a short stay at Adelaide went on to Melbourne. In Melbourne, in 1848 he bought a weatherboard building on the corner of Williams Street and Flinders Lane and went into business as a classer and packer and as a buyer of wool for sale in England. In 1850 he set up the first regular wool auction in Bourke St, Melbourne. In 1853 he went into partnership with Edward Row and George Kirk under the name of E. Row and Company. He prospered and was able to buy a substantial bluestone warehouse and a second one in 1857 at the corner of Bourke and William Streets. In 1857 he took Hugh Parker into partnership and the business of R. Goldsbrough and Company was established. The building at the corner of Bourke and William Streets was begun in 1862. Other partners were admitted in later years, John Sutcliffe Horsfall, David Parker and Arthur Parker in 1876; and in 1881 the business was amalgamated with the Australasian Agency and Banking Corporation and formed into a public company, R Goldsbrough & Co Ltd, of which Goldsbrough was chairman of directors. In the 1870s Goldsbrough was also associated with Alexander Robertson, John Wagner and Salathiel Booth in several properties. Goldsbrough died at Melbourne from an internal tumour on 8 April 1886. He and his wife, Emma Hodgson (1822‚Äì1877), probably had three children, all of whom died young in Yorkshire. Goldsbrough died without a surviving wife or children. In 1888, his partners merged with the Sydney firm of Mort & Co to form Goldsbrough Mort & Co Ltd. In 1963, the firm merged again to form Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd which traded under that name until 1982. The present day business is Elders Limited. Goldsbrough took little part in public life, although he was a steward of the Victoria Racing Club from its formation in 1864 until 1886. He was essentially a business man, always abreast of the times. He had played an important role in the development of the wool trade of Australia.

The ', sometimes called \\"Lily Corps\\" in English, was a group of 222 students and 18 teachers of the Okinawa Daiichi Women's High School and Okinawa Shihan Women's School formed into a nursing unit for the Imperial Japanese Army during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. They were mobilized by the Japanese army on March 23, 1945. Many of the Himeyuri students were told (and thought) that the Japanese army would defeat the Americans in a matter of days, and therefore brought along school supplies and their uniforms to study and prepare to return to school. By the end of the war, only a small number of Himeyuri students and faculty had survived.  History  Falsely briefed of working in Red Cross hospitals away from the fighting, the Himeyuri students were instead positioned on the front lines performing crude surgery and amputations, burying the dead, transporting ammunition and supplies to front-line troops, and other life- threatening duties under continuous fire throughout the nearly 3-month-long battle. Near the end of the Okinawan war, those still alive endured disease and malnutrition in dark caves filled with countless gravely injured and dead civilians, soldiers, and co-students.  Unit dissolution and casualties  The entrance to a cave where several dozen Himeyuri students died on June 19th, 1945 Up until the Himeyuri unit was dissolved, only 19 students had been killed. On June 18, 1945, a rough dissolution order was given to the unit. Told simply to \\"go home\\" amidst total war, the schoolgirls suffered a high casualty rate in the crossfire of Japanese and American forces. In the early hours of the next day (June 19), 5 teachers and 46 students hiding inside the Ihara third surgery shelter were killed by white phosphorus munitions during an attack by US forces \\\\- unaware of the students' presence. In the week following the dissolution order, approximately 80% of the girls and their teachers remaining on Okinawa Island perished. 136 Himeyuri mobilised into the Haebaru Army Field Hospital were killed. Overall, 211 students and 16 teachers were killed.of those killed, 91 (88 students, 3 teachers) were not part of the mobilised group, yet died during the war. Some committed suicide in various ways because of chastity fears of systematic rape by US soldiers. Before the fighting could end, some students threw themselves off the jagged cliffs of the Arasaki seashore, poisoned themselves with cyanide (earlier administered to soldiers in terminal condition), while others killed themselves with hand grenades given to them by Japanese soldiers.  Himeyuri Monument  The Himeyuri Monument was built on April 7, 1946 in memory of those who died. The monument stands in front of the Peace Museum. It lists the names of every Himeyuri student and teacher killed during the War. Many of those who survived helped build and continue to maintain the facilities. As of 2020, there are still several Himeyuri students alive. The Himeyuri Monument in Itoman, Okinawa  Himeyuri Peace Museum  The Himeyuri Peace Museum was modelled after the main school building in which the girls had once studied. Renovated and reopened on Okinawa Memorial Day in 2009, the museum has six display chambers displaying photos from the eve of the Battle of Okinawa, the Haebaru Army Field Hospital, portraits of all the young victims who died after the military's retreat to the southernmost tip of the Kyan Peninsula, panels explaining the circumstances under which they died, twenty-eight volumes of testimonials and memoirs by survivors, and a life-sized diorama of the aforementioned cave where many students lost their lives. The testimonials bring to life each phase of the battle, as witnessed by the student nurses. Some of the former nurses have served as both tour guides and curators at the museum. A second renovation of the museum is planned to take place in June 2020, with input from surviving Himeyuri students.

Beneath Annenberg Hall, Loker Commons offers a number of student facilities. __TOC__ Conception and construction Between 1865 and 1868 an alumni \\"Committee of Fifty\\" raised $370,000 (equal to one-twelfth of Harvard's entire endowment at the time) toward a new building in memory of Harvard men who had fought for the Union in the American Civil War, particularly the 136 deada \\"Hall of Alumni in which students and graduates might be inspired by the pictured and sculpted presence of her founders, benefactors, faculty, presidents, and most distinguished sons.\\" When, about the same time, a $40,000 bequest was received from Charles Sanders (class of 1802) for \\"a hall or theatre to be used on [any] public occasion connected with the College, whether literary or festive\\", a vision was formed of a single building containing a large theater as well as a large open hall, and thus meeting both goals. A site was found on the \\"Delta\\", the triangle bounded by Cambridge, Kirkland, and Quincy Streets. The project was formally named Memorial Hall in September 1870, and on October 6 the cornerstone was laid, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. composing a hymn for the occasion. In May 1878 the Committee of Fifty notified the President and Fellows that the project was complete and the premises ready for formal transfer to the university. On July8 the President and Fellows unanimously voted to \\"accept with profound gratitude this splendid and precious gift.\\" Architecture and facilities Plan (1874, north at top) showing Alumni Hall (left and center), Memorial Transept (center-right), and Sanders Theatre (right) The building's High Victorian Gothic design, by alumni William Robert Ware and Henry Van Brunt, was selected in a blind competition. A 1907 publication gives dimensions of 305 by 113 feet, with a height of 190 feet at the tower; a 2012 source gave a height of 195 feet, making it the ninth-tallest building in Cambridge at that time. Its 1970 National Historic Landmark designation recognized it one of the nation's most dramatic examples of High Victorian Gothic architecture. A general restoration was carried out between 1987 and 1996.Office for the Arts at Harvard: Annenberg Hall; Aug. 15, 2011 http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~memhall/annenberg.html Annenberg Hall What was originally known as Alumni Hallnine thousand square feet shaped by massive wooden trusses, walnut paneling, and a blue, stenciled ceilingwas dedicated in 1874. Originally intended for formal occasions such as alumni dinners, it was almost immediately converted to a dining commons, and was for fifty years the college's main dining hall (charging, in 1884, $3.97 for a month's meals). \\"Fact and Rumor\\", Harvard Crimson, November 15, 1884. In 1893 the Harvard Graduates Magazine described \\"the throngs of men who, at one o'clock, are to be seen racing across the yard from Harvard, Boylston, and Sever [Halls], striving to reach [Memorial] Hall ahead of slower competitors for vacant seats at the overtaxed tables\\". But \\"as the center of University life moved south toward the Charles, [the dining commons] became less popular and closed in 1925\\" (see Harvard College ¬ß House system) after which Alumni Hall saw mostly light use, typically as a venue for dances, banquets, examinations, and the like. In 1934 The New York Times reported that Harvard officials had \\"at last found a use for Memorial Hall\\" by siting a rifle range in the basement.

Memorial Transept seen from the north door The Memorial Transept [] consists of a gothic vault above a marble floor, with black walnut paneling and stenciled walls, a large stained glass window over each of two exterior doors, andcommemorating the 136 Harvard men who died fighting for the Uniontwenty-eight white tablets, Confederate deaths are not represented. Memorial Transept serves as a vestibule for Sanders Theatre. Sanders Theatre Sanders Theatre, c. 1876 Sanders Theatre (substantially completed in 1875, but first used for Harvard's 1876 commencement) was inspired by Christopher Wren's Sheldonian Theatre. Renowned for its acoustics, and one of Harvard's largest classrooms, Sanders Theatre (capacity 1000) is in great demand for lectures, concerts, ceremonies and conferences. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Jr, and Mikhail Gorbachev have spoken there. Sanders features John La Farge's stained-glass window Athena Tying a Mourning Fillet; statues of James Otis (by Thomas Crawford) and Josiah Quincy III (by William Wetmore Story) flank the stage. The exterior gables display busts of great orators: Demosthenes, Cicero, John Chrysostom, Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, Edmund Burke, and Daniel Webster. Sanders Theatre contributed in an unusual way to the early work of Wallace Sabine, considered the founder of architectural acoustics. In 1895, tasked with improving the dismal acoustical performance of the Fogg Museum's lecture hall, Sabine carried out a series of nocturnal experiments there, using hundreds of seat cushions borrowed from nearby Sanders as sound-absorbent material; his work each night was limited by the requirement that the cushions be returned to Sanders in time for morning lectures there. The scientific unit of sound absorption, the sabin, is very close to the absorption provided by one Sanders Theatre cushion.

Four-faced clock was added 1897, and destroyed by fire 1956. by 1876, but criticism convinced Van Brunt and Ware to revise it in 1877. In 1897 was added what a 1905 guidebook described as \\"an enormous [four-faced clock which] detonates the hours in a manner which is by no means conducive to the sleep of the just and the rest of the weary\\", and which Kenneth John Conant termed \\"railroad Gothic\\". In 1932 the clock's driving works, and the associated 155-pound (70kg) bell-clapper, were somehow lowered 115 feet (35m) to the ground without attracting attention; visiting Yale students were suspected but the clapper was never found. Three years later the disappearance of the replacement clapper, under similar circumstances, was rumored to be Yale's revenge for the theft of its mascot, Handsome Dan.

Background After the release and tour for the band's previous album, The Story of a Young Heart, guitarist Paul Reynolds had left the band for personal reasons. Brothers Mike and Ali Score wanted to base the band out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With past success in the USA, both brothers thought leaving the UK and a new life in America was a perfect solution. With the popularity of the first two albums and the name \\"A Flock of Seagulls\\" still having some equity, they had 4 straight sell-out shows in Philadelphia. Mike, Ali and Frank Maudsley all applied for and were conditionally awarded green cards based on celebrity status under the O-1 work visa. The conditional approval was granted to all three, who settled in Philadelphia. Maudsley soon became disillusioned with living in a strange city; he loved A Flock of Seagulls but had no family. Missing the UK, he returned to England. Mike and Ali stayed in Philadelphia and satisfied the terms of the visa. With Frank in Britain and the brothers in the USA it would appear the band was split into two camps. In fact, it was Frank Maudsley who kept the band communicating. Ultimately, the brothers had a falling out and the band dissolved; with Ali moving to Boston. Ali played in a hard rock band and then worked for a computer company in Cambridge once the work visa turned into a permanent residency.  Recording history  In an 1986 interview with Gary Graff of Free Press Music, Mike noted that, after writing \\"Heartbeat Like a Drum\\", he decided the band should become more dance-oriented again. Originally, the album was to be solo material, but the record company believed it would be better suited under the band's name. As they couldn't find a producer they wanted to work with, it was suggested that Mike take on the task of producing instead. Dream Come True would be the first album he would produce. Maudsley was the go-between for the brothers and, during the recording of Dream Come True, some have indicated that Ali played on only 3 songs, Maudsley on 4 and Mike did all 9. One of the songs that all three did play on was entitled \\"Cosmos (Effect of the Sun)\\" and was dropped from the album. This dropping of the song brought the track listing down to 9 songs for the album.The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History: The Video Generation, 1981‚Äì1990 MA Janosik ‚Äì 2006 ‚Äì Greenwood Press A large row ensued where Maudsley and Ali wanted to drop \\"Love on Your Knees\\" and include \\"Cosmos.\\" It was with this argument that two videos, \\"Who's That Girl (She's Got It)\\" and \\"Heartbeat Like a Drum,\\" were filmed in quick succession. These two videos were the last time the three remaining members were together in a recording or music capacity until 2004. The tour for the album added Chris Chryssaphis on keyboards and Gary Steadman‚Äîformerly of the new wave band Classix Nouveaux‚Äîas a replacement for Paul Reynolds on lead guitar. Both new additions did not stay in the band after the tour ended. In 2004, the album was released on CD for the first time by Almacantar Records. It featured no bonus tracks. In 2011, the album was remastered on CD by Cherry Red. It included the 7\\" and 12\\" versions of \\"Who's That Girl (She's Got It)\\" and \\"Heartbeat Like A Drum,\\" and \\"(Cosmos) The Effect Of The Sun\\" as bonus tracks. Reception The album failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic and thus was a commercial failure. It also received generally negative reviews. Dan LeRoy from AllMusic retrospectively noted the songs were \\"lifeless.\\" A reviewer from People found the album's songwriting to be \\"ineffective\\" and the album itself to be \\"all formula and flourish with no substance\\". Regardless, they felt that Dream Come True had a \\"much stronger [and] pervasive\\" beat than the previous LPs from the band.

Early life and naval career Dawson was born in Dalkeith House, Richmond upon Thames, Surrey, the son of landowner and barrister Hugh Dawson and his wife Mary Ann (n√©e Chaffer).Biography, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1879 and trained at the Royal Academy, Gosport, and in the training ship HMS Britannia in Dartmouth, Devon. In 1881, he was promoted midshipman in the Channel Squadron and undertook further training at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, the Royal Artillery College at Woolwich, and the torpedo school in HMS Vernon. He was promoted lieutenant on 20 November 1887 and served in a cruiser in the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1892, he became an experimental officer at Woolwich Arsenal. Business career In 1896, he left the Royal Navy to join the armaments firm Vickers as ordnance superintendent, becoming a director in 1898, and managing director in 1906. He remained in this post until his death. He was also chairman of Chilworth Gunpowder from 1900 and was a director of many of Vickers' subsidiaries, including Canadian Vickers, Vickers-Terni in Italy, and the Placencias Arsenal in Spain. Other directorships included Wolseley Motors and William Beardmore & Co. He retained close connections with the Royal Navy (his commission on the Emergency List was restored in 1902) and the British Government and sat on a number of government committees. He also collected intelligence for the Admiralty on his foreign trips, including one occasion when he skated around the ice-bound dockyards of Kiel to see the German naval ships under construction. He was knighted on 13 December 1909. During the First World War, his prominence in the armaments industry naturally increased even further. Although he retained the trust of the government, Vickers, along with other armaments firms, was accused of charging too much. His standing was also damaged by the so-called 'dope scandal'. In 1915-1916, Dawson aided the MP and speculator Grant Morden in setting up the British Cellulose and Chemical Manufacturing Company. The value of the shares was later pushed up by unscrupulous means to an artificially high level, until they were worth ¬£14 10s in 1918 (having originally been worth 6d each). This blatant war profiteering was investigated by a parliamentary select committee in 1918 and an official inquiry chaired by Lord Sumner in 1919. He was to have been raised to the peerage in the 1917 New Year Honours, but his name was removed from the list at the last minute, probably because of the unpopularity of the armaments companies. He was, however, created a baronet, of Edgewarebury, of the parish of Edgware, in the County of Middlesex, in the 1920 New Year Honours. He was also appointed Grand Cross of the Order of Naval Merit by Spain and was a member of the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 2nd class, of Japan.Biography, Who Was Who He was a member of council of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor. In recognition of his war service, he was promoted commander in the Royal Navy as of 11 November 1918. The Canadian Steamship Lines named a 600-foot lake freighter the in October 1916.WILL NAME NEW STEAMER THE SIR TREVOR DAWSON., Buffalo Daily Courier, August 21, 1916 After the war, his influence declined. Another scandal broke in 1920, when Vickers was sued by Admiral Sir Percy Scott over royalty payments for a gun sight manufactured by Vickers which Scott had invented and patented. The judge, Lord Coleridge, made it quite clear that he did not believe Dawson's testimony, and found in Scott's favour. Dawson offered to resign from Vickers, but was refused. He was later implicated in shady dealings with the Turkish government over oil in Iraq. Dawson was a strong proponent of airships, which Vickers had begun building in 1908. He persuaded Vickers to collaborate in the construction of the R100 in the second half of the 1920s. Although the airship was a success, Vickers lost a substantial amount of money (¬£220,000) over the project. Interests and family Dawson was a committed imperialist. He was a knight of the Round Table Club, which promoted inter-imperial trade. In 1916, he formed a pressure group called the London Imperialists, which aimed to promote the election of MPs sympathetic to imperial trade in London constituencies. This later expanded into the British Commonwealth Union, and he sat on the executive committee from 1918 to 1925. Dawson married Louise Grant in 1892. They had two sons and two daughters. He died suddenly of heart failure at his country seat, Edgewarebury House in Elstree, Hertfordshire, and was buried in Elstree churchyard. The baronetcy passed to his son, Sir Hugh Trevor Dawson, who also served as an officer in the Royal Navy.

Brunner was educated in New York and in Manchester, England. He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied under William R. Ware. Early in his career, he worked in the architectural office of George B. Post. He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects after 1892 and was appointed by Theodore Roosevelt to the United States Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C. He was a member of the New York Fine Arts Commission, the American Civic Association, The Century Association, The Engineer's Club, The Players, the Cosmos Club in Washington D.C., the National Institute of Arts and Letters, The Union Club of Cleveland, and several other organizations. In 1910, he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1916. Brunner was also known as a city planner, and made significant contributions to the city plans of Cleveland, Ohio, Rochester, New York, Baltimore, Maryland, Denver, Colorado, Trenton, New Jersey, and Albany, New York. Brunner was, for a short time, partnered with Thomas Tryon as the firm Brunner & Tryon. Notable works Brunner designed several notable buildings including, with Tryon, the 1897 Congregation Shearith Israel, on Central Park West, New York, to house the United States' oldest Jewish congregation, founded in 1654.Congregation Shearith Israel , Building Report, International Survey of Jewish Monuments. Retrieved 3 April 2007. No attempt was made to convey an \\"eastern\\" vocabulary, as was often being done for other Jewish congregations: Brunner and Tryon provided a forthright Roman Baroque temple with a projecting three-bay center that contrasts with the windowless ashlar masonry flanking it and contains a recessed loggia entrance under three large arch-headed windows, articulated by a colossal order of Corinthian columns surmounted by a pediment over a paneled attic frieze. Another synagogue designed by Brunner was Temple Israel at 201 Lenox Avenue, at 120th Street, in 1907.Dunlap, David W. From Abyssinian to Zion: A Guide to Manhattan's Houses of Worship, Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 270. The limestone building was not designed in the typical Moorish Revival style of other synagogues of the time; Brunner argued that \\"synagogues have no traditional lines of architectural expression\\".Dunlap, David W. From Abyssinian to Zion: A Guide to Manhattan's Houses of Worship, Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 152. According to David W. Dunlap, the building \\"looks like a Roman temple until you notice the Stars of David in the column capitals, fanlights, and spandrel panels\\", and \\"may rank as the single best Neoclassical synagogue in Manhattan\\". Brunner also designed improvements at the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, the Stadium of the College of the City of New York - also known as Lewisohn Stadium, Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, and the U.S. Post Office, Custom House and Courthouse (1910, illustrated) in the Group Plan conceived by Daniel Burnham, John Carr√®re, and Brunner in 1903 to create a new urbanistic center for Cleveland, Ohio, which was a rare realisation of a \\"City Beautiful\\" plan.Encyclopedia of Cleveland.

The Toko Stream flows through the area to join the Patea River. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, the Toko statistical area has a population of 1,188, an increase of 24 people since the 2006 census. The statistical area covers a large region to the east of Stratford, not just the settlement of Toko. Geography Toko is surrounded by extremely fertile land, being located on the periphery of the Taranaki ringplain and adjacent to the Patea River. The area is drained by the Toko Stream, and its tributaries the Manawaiwiri and Waiwiri Streams. Once covered in wetlands, since settlement the area has been drained to take advantage of the fertile soils. Dairy farming predominates the surrounding land use, with some sheep and beef farming in the steeper hill country. History Toko was established in the 1890s, and served as an important centre for the developing hinterland. The settlement took on the nature of a village, containing a railway station, a dairy factory, a church, a hall, a hotel, a sawmill, a trucking depot, a playcentre, a sports facility, and a number of other businesses and numerous dwellings. Toko School was established in 1893, and located on a site approximately 2 km east of Toko at the intersection of East Road and Wawiri Road. Like other rural centres, Toko went into decline in the latter part of the 20th century. The railway station, dairy factory and sawmill all closed.

The borough comprises much of the city centre of downtown Trondheim plus part of the Bymarka rural areas to the west. Location Midtbyen proper is located north and west of the river Nidelva, south of the Trondheim channel and east of the neighborhood of Ila, thus being north of √òya and Elgeseter, west of Bakklandet and south of Bratt√∏ra. The borough of Midtbyen also comprises areas of Ila, By√•sen, Trolla and Stavne. The city's most historic buildings and central institutions are located here. The area is primarily commercial with office buildings and retail stores, though there is also some dense housing. The westernmost part of Midtbyen is dominated by housing, while commercial interests dominate the eastern section. In the middle of Midtbyen is Trondheim Torg (Trondheim torv), a square that features a statue of the city's founder, Olav Tryggvason. History Midtbyen dates back to the Viking Era when it started as a marketplace, in 997 according to the saga of Olav Tryggvason. It was formerly called Kaupangen i Nidaros by Olav Tryggvason and later Nidaros (Old Norse: Ni√∞ar√≥ss). The original marketplace of Trondheim grew up around the mouth of the Nid River. In the 11th century, Nidaros was turned into the Archiepiscopate of Nidaros and for a period, until 1217, it was the capital of Norway. Midtbyen and the immediate surrounding area remained the only settled area of Trondheim until the late 19th century when the city started expanding outside the Midtbyen limits. The name Midtbyen dates back to after the merging of Trondheim with the surrounding municipalities in the 1960s. Transport As the centre of the city, Midtbyen serves as the most important transportation hub in Trondheim. Public transport has its main hub at Munkegata Terminal at Trondheim Torg while the Trondheim Tramway terminates at St. Olavs gate. Just over the canal on Bratt√∏ra is Trondheim Central Station providing both local and express train services. In the summer there is also a ferry to Munkholmen from Ravnkloa.

It is located on the northern edge of the village of Orglandes, about south east of Cherbourg and west of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise on the Cotentin Peninsula. The burials come from summer 1944, immediately following D-Day and the Battle of Normandy. It is the second smallest of the six German war cemeteries in Normandy with a little over 10,000 burials. The cemetery is maintained and managed by the voluntary German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge). Formation Created during the Battle of Normandy on 20 June 1944, the cemetery was formed by the 603rd Quartermaster Graves Registration Company for the burial of fallen 1st US Army service personnel. Initially one field containing American war dead was created followed by another for German casualties. At the war's end over 7,300 German soldiers were interred at the cemetery. The American Battle Monuments Commission began exhuming the remains of American servicemen after the war and transferred them in accordance with the wishes of their families. Beginning in 1945, the Americans moved two-thirds of their fallen from this site back to the United States while the remainder were re-interred at the new permanent American Cemetery and Memorial at Colleville-sur-Mer, which overlooks the Omaha Beach landing beach. The burial plots of the Americans were reused by to inter German war dead from 1,400 locations across the Normandy region by the French authorities (Service Francais des Sepultures). In 1954, the Franco-German War Graves Agreement ratified that the Reinternment Commission of the Volksbund could move German bodies from field graves and village cemeteries. During the removals many previously anonymous German soldiers were identified. Between 1958 and 1961, Orglandes was redeveloped by the German War Graves Commission. Over time, further German war dead were interred at the cemetery from their original field burials. There are now 10,152 graves at the site, arranged in 28 rows, each marked with a stone cross. Headstones are double-sided with the majority containing multiple interments. Layout The German military cemetery on northern side of Orglandes The entrance is marked by a small house surmounted by a bell tower. The cemetery consists of 28 rows of graves, each grave marked by a stone cross. Each cross details the name and date of birth and death of each of the six or more dead soldiers buried to each cross. The cemetery is administered and maintained by the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge). The landscaping was completed in 1958 and the cemetery was inaugurated on September 20, 1961. Post war casualties A single mass grave contains the remains of 22 German prisoners of war who died on 25 October 1945. It is thought the men were members of a mine clearance team that were killed by the accidental explosion of demolition charges in Asni√®res-en-Bessin close to Bayeux. The devastating explosion means the men's remains were interred together.

What made the car 'special' was its low-slung chassis, considered a remedy to the poor road-holding of small sports cars.Cox, p.11 The first cars used the 832 cc side-valve engine from the Triumph Super 7 fitted to an 84 inch wheelbase chassis bought in from Rubery Owen, semi- elliptic leaf springs all round, and the hydraulic brakes and axles from the Triumph.Cox, p.30, p.59 The top speed was only 65 mph (105 km/h),Cox, p.63 which was too slow for serious sporting events: so from 1933 a 1098 cc, overhead-inlet, side-exhaust, four-cylinder, Coventry Climax engine was offered, followed in 1934 by the 1476 cc six-cylinder version of the same engine. Most of the cars had lightweight two-seater open bodies with fold-flat windscreens, but a four-seat version on a long-wheelbase chassis, called the 'Tourette', was available with the larger-engined versions.Cox, p.42 In 1933 a new model, the Vale 'Vixen', was proposed with a larger engine size, longer 102 inch wheelbase on a stronger chassis, a redesigned steering system and other improvements. The blueprint exists, but a complete car was never built.Cox, pp.59-61 Around 55-60 cars had been built by the company when production stopped in 1935, though some have suggested that there were more, up to 80.Cox, p.147 See also * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom  References =Bibliography * * *  External links  * Dave Cox: Ave Atque Vale - the story of the Vale Special * Hon P.

This is from copy K, in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. This is from copy K, in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Plate 13 Europe a Prophecy is a 1794 prophetic book by the British poet and illustrator William Blake. It is engraved on 18 plates, and survives in just nine known copies. It followed America a Prophecy of 1793. Background During autumn 1790, Blake moved to Lambeth, Surrey. He had a studio at the new house that he used while writing what were later called his \\"Lambeth Books\\", which included Europe in 1794. Like the others under the title, all aspects of the work, including the composition of the designs, the printing of them, the colouring of them, and the selling of them, happened at his home.Bentley 2003 pp.122-124 Early sketches for Europe were included in a notebook that contained images were created between 1790 until 1793.Bentley 2003 p. 142 Only a few of Blake's works were fully coloured, and only some of the editions of Europe were coloured.Bentley 2003 p. 158 When Europe was printed, it was in the same format as Blake's America and sold for the same price. It was printed between 1794 and 1821 with only 9 copies of the work surviving.Bentley 2003 p. 152 The plates used for the designs were 23 x 17 cm in size. In addition to the illuminations, the work contained 265 lines of poetry,Bentley 2003 p. 198 which were organized into septenaries.Bentley 2003 p. 312 Henry Crabb Robinson contacted William Upcott on 19 April 1810 inquiring about copies of Blake's works that were in his possession. On that day, Robinson was allowed access to Europe and America and created a transcription of the works.Bentley 2003 p. 338 An edition of Europe for Frederick Tatham was the last work Blake produced, and The Ancient of Days was completed three days just prior to his death.Bentley 2003 p. 436 Poem The book is prefaced by an image known as The Ancient of Days, a depiction of Urizen separating light and darkness. The poem begins with a description of the source for the vision:Bentley 2003 p. 150-151 The poem then explains that it is about:Bentley 2003 p. 151 The poem describes the creation of the serpent:Bentley 2003 p. 151 The poem concludes with Los calling his sons to arms:Bentley 2003 p. 152 Plate six of Europe a Prophecy, copy K. The poem envisions a world filled with suffering, with imagery connected to the politics of 1790s Britain Themes Europe, like many of Blake's other works, is a mythological narrative and is considered a \\"prophecy\\". However, only America and Europe were ever given that title by Blake. He understood the word not to denote a description of the future, but the view of the honest and the wise.Bentley 2003 p. 130 The vision within the poem, along with some of the other prophecies, is of a world filled with suffering in a manner that is connected to the politics of 1790s Britain.Bentley 2003 p. 150 God in The Ancient of Days is a \\"nous\\" figure, a creative principle in the universe that establishes mathematical order and permanence that allows life to keep from becoming nothingness. In such a view, Jesus is seen as a Logos figure that is disconnected from the nous in that Logos constantly recreates what is beautiful. As such, Jesus, as well as the Holy Spirit, are connected in Blake's mythology to the image of the universal man as opposed to God the Father.Frye 1990 p. 52 The image is also connected to John Milton's Paradise Lost in which God uses a golden compass to circumscribe the universe. Blake's version does not create Eden but instead is creating the serpent of the poem's frontispiece. The image is also connected to a vision Blake witnessed at the steps inside of his home.Bentley 2003 pp. 150-151 There are parallels between the actions of women within Europe and the 1820s images titled Drawings for The Book of Enoch. The latter work describes the seduction of the Watchers of Heaven by the Daughters of Men; giants born of their union then proceed to ravage the land. Both works emphasise the dominance of women.Bentley 2003 pp. 428-429 Blake had many expectations for the French revolution, which is described in a prophetic way within the poem. However, he was disappointed when the fallen state of existence returned without the changes that Blake had hoped. To Blake, the French promoted a bad idea of reason, and he was disappointed when there was not a sensual liberation. After Napoleon declared himself emperor in 1804, Blake believed that the revolutionary heroes were instead being treated as god kings that no longer cared about freedom. He continued to believe in an apocalyptic state that would soon appear, but he no longer believed that Orc man, the leader of a revolution, would be the agent of the apocalypse. Instead, he believed that God could only exist in men, and he distrusted all hero worship.Frye 1990 pp. 216‚Äì217 Critical response Robinson wrote an essay about Blake's works in 1810 and described Europe and America as \\"mysterious and incomprehensible rhapsody\\".Bentley 2003 qtd. p. 340 Blake's fame grew in 1816 with an entry in A Biographical Dictionary of the Living Authors of Great Britain and Ireland, which included Europe among the works of \\"an eccentric but very ingenious artist\\".Bentley 2003 qtd p. 348 Northrop Frye regarded it as Blake's \\"greatest achievement\\" in \\"a kind of 'free verse' recitativo in which the septenarius is mixed with lyrical meters.\\"Frye 1990 p. 185 According to John Beer: \\"The drift of the argument in Europe is to show how a Christian message that has been veiled, and cults exalting virginity, have together fostered the so-called Enlightenment philosophy which left no place for the visionary.\\"Beer 2005 p. 82 NotesReferences * Beer, John.

It is the southernmost town in Sweden located some west from the southernmost point of Sweden and the Scandinavian peninsula. It is one of the most important ferry towns in Scandinavia as well as around the Baltic Sea, and the main town of the S√∂dersl√§tt agricultural areas. Etymology The first written record of the name is from 1291, Threl√¶burgh. The name is found in many places in Scandinavia.Svenskt ortnamnslexikon 2003 Borg means castle or stronghold and tr√§l can mean thrall, but can also refer to the leaning poles on the outside of the medieval Viking stronghold. Remains of the original stronghold were excavated in 1988. The name may also have originated from the stronghold that still remains in the center of the city. Strongholds like that have been found at several places around Scandinavia, mostly in the south of Sweden and Denmark, and are all called trelleborgs. The name is likely to have originated from that borg. History Trelleborgen, a reconstructed Viking ring castle in Trelleborg The earliest written record of Trelleborg is from 1257, when Trelleborg was presented as a wedding gift from the Danish royal family to the Swedish Prince Valdemar. It was soon reconquered by the Danes, and it belonged to Denmark until 1658, when Scania was lost to Sweden by the Treaty of Roskilde. In medieval times, Trelleborg had an important part in herring fishing. At that time, this was conducted along the entire coast line of what is now Sweden, as the herring shoals were of such great numbers that fishermen were said to have been able to stand on the shore and land fish with nets. Trelleborg became an important merchant city as merchants from Germany came to trade herring. In 1619 following a devastating fire, the Danish King decided that one merchant city on the coast was sufficient and revoked Trelleborg's status as a merchant city in favour of Malm√∂. Not until 1840 was Trelleborg allowed to become a merchant city, and not until 1867 did it regain its rights as a city of Sweden. Mostly this was thanks to the work of a few stubborn men, who had continuously been petitioning the Swedish Riksdag with these requests since 1658. The local government reform of 1971 made Trelleborg the seat of Trelleborg Municipality, covering both rural and urban areas. Harbour and ferries The ferry station in Trelleborg, \\"The Continental Bridge\\", serves three shipping lines at four different routes, and in all six different ferry lines. The harbour has a very strategic position, in the very far south of the Scandinavian peninsula. The first ferry connection to Germany opened in 1897.http://gamlatrelleborg.se/historia-2/hamnen/ This was replaced with a train-ferry line to Sa√ünitz, in 1909 as a part of the line Malm√∂ - Berlin.https://www.oppetarkiv.se/video/1810844/journalfilm-svensk- jarnvagstrafik During the GDR era, a longer car ferry line opened to Travem√ºnde (\\"modern harbour\\" of L√ºbeck), initially as line owned by the Swedish national railways (SJ), but known as TT-Line from 1962. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, several new shipping lines and routes opened. Trelleborg municipality built a joint ferry terminal for all services, known as \\"Kontinentbron\\", or \\"the Continental Bridge\\". Both Germany and Poland can be reached by ferries from the terminal. As of 2018, the following shipping lines and routes are in operation: TT-Line * to Klaipƒóda (Lithuania) * to Travem√ºnde (Germany) * to Rostock (Germany) * to Swinoujscie (Poland) Stena Line * to Sa√ünitz (Germany) * to Rostock (Germany) Unity Line * to Swinoujscie (Poland) Most of the ferry transports are lorries, and this makes Trelleborg's port the largest in Sweden in terms of goods by weight. In 2005, 11 million metric ton of goods passed through the port (along with almost 2 million passengers).Nils-√Öke Siversson & John Bitton \\"√ñresund ett fr√•n himlen\\", Trafiknostalgiska f√∂rlaget, www.trafiknostalgiske.se, , page 38 Climate Although Trelleborg does not have an official month to month weather station featured in SMHI's reports, its nearest weather stations in Falsterbo and Malm√∂ both indicate an oceanic climate (Cfb) with warm and sometimes hot summers averaging in the low twenties Celsius most of the time and cool but generally not very cold winters with means at or just above freezing. Today TT‚ÄëLine ferry routes; the company operates regular service between Trelleborg and Germany At the end of the 19th century, Trelleborg became an industrial town and the foundation of modern Trelleborg has largely been created by a few large companies; most notably Trelleborg Industries and the ferry company and business related to the seaport. Much of it has been the work of the influential businessman Johan Kock. Other important industries he established were Akzo Nobel Inks, Today called Flint Group Sweden, manufacturing printing inks (established as Gleitzman Industries in the 1890s), and DUX, who make beds. Later in the 1950s, Perstorp (Flooring) Industries was established in Trelleborg and it manufactures flooring boards and other plastic material. Trelleborg continues to be a working-class- oriented city and is politically a traditional stronghold for the Swedish Social Democratic Party. However, since the latest elections in 2006 the Social Democratic Party is in opposition in the municipality. It is today often visited by people travelling from Sweden to Germany because of the ferries to Rostock, Sassnitz, and L√ºbeck - Travem√ºnde in Germany. These ferries began sailing on May 1, 1897, with the Sassnitz line; the route to Travem√ºnde was established in 1962, while the line to the former East German city Rostock was inaugurated after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The ferries carry both passengers on one-day journeys, cars with vacationing families, and heavy trucks on their way through Europe. In April 1917, Lenin arrived with the ferry from Sassnitz to Trelleborg on his way from exile back to Russia to lead the Revolution. Today Trelleborg has the second largest seaport of Sweden, behind Gothenburg. Every year it transports more than 10 million metric tonnes of cargo. Overlooking the harbour of Smygehuk near Trelleborg is a statue of a nude woman that was installed in 1930. Actress Uma Thurman's grandmother, the mother of Nena von Schlebr√ºgge, was the model for this statue.Uma Thurmans mormor staty i Trelleborg , Sydsvenskan, 30 July 2006.

Even if provided with undeniable proof that the limb belongs to and is attached to their own body, the patient produces elaborate confabulations about whose limb it really is or how the limb ended up on their body. In some cases, delusions become so elaborate that a limb may be treated and cared for as if it were a separate being. Somatoparaphrenia differs from a similar disorder, asomatognosia, which is characterized as loss of recognition of half of the body or a limb, possibly due to paralysis or unilateral neglect. For example, asomatognosic patients may mistake their arm for the doctor's. However, they can be shown their limb and this error is temporarily corrected. Somatoparaphrenia has been reported to occur predominately in the left arm of one's body, and it is often accompanied by left-sided paralysis and anosognosia (denial or lack of awareness) of the paralysis. The link between somatoparaphrenia and paralysis has been documented in many clinical cases, and while the question arises as to whether paralysis is necessary for somatoparaphrenia to occur, anosognosia is not, as documented by cases with somatoparaphrenia and paralysis with no anosognosia. Causes It has been suggested that damage to the posterior cerebral regions (temporoparietal junction) of the cortex may play a significant role in the development of somatoparaphrenia. However, more recent studies have shown that damage to deep cortical regions such as the posterior insula and subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia, the thalamus and the white matter connecting the thalamus to the cortex may also play a significant role in the development of somatoparaphrenia. It has also been suggested that involvement of deep cortical and subcortical grey structures of the temporal lobe may contribute to reduce the sense of familiarity experienced by somatoparaphrenic patients for their paralyzed limb. DiagnosisTreatment One form of treatment that has produced a more integrated body awareness is mirror therapy, in which the individual who denies that the affected limb belongs to their body looks into a mirror at the limb. Patients looking into the mirror state that the limb does belong to them; however body ownership of the limb does not remain after the mirror is taken away.

Life Tona Scherchen was born into a musical family in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland. Her father was conductor Hermann Scherchen and her mother was composer Xiao Shuxian. She spent the first 12 years of her life in Europe, particularly in Switzerland. She arrived in China in 1950 with her mother and her older sister F√©f√©. In 1956, just a year before China fell into political chaos, she returned to Europe to be with her father in order to pursue further music education. Her teachers included Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Hans Werner Henze. After the 1960s, Scherchen had become an active composer, titles of her music were frequently seen in contemporary music programmes. Her works were published by prominent publishers, and several articles on her as a composer can be found, although after some appearances in 1980s, she seemingly ceased to catch attention beyond her French circle. Music Scherchen's music is an adaption of the avant-garde idioms of the European 1960s, '70s, synthesized with a language of her own. Many of her compositions bear Chinese titles, but the influence of Chinese arts and thoughts is more conceptual than literal. The only exception is Yi, a suite for one marimba with two players, in which she recalled folk tunes heard in her Chinese years. It is a moving piece, dedicated to her mother, whom Tona probably was not able to meet for three decades due to the political situation. Several recordings of Tona's works have been commercially issued, but today only Lo for trombone and strings, and Shen for six percussionists, can be found on CD, despite all her music being available in print.

He was known as Khomanei- e-Pakistan.  Early life  Arif Hussain al-Hussaini was born on 25 November 1946 in the Village Piwaar of District Kurram, Parachinar into the house of Fazal Hussain Shah. His family belongs to the Husseini branch of Syeds, which trace descent to the fourth Shi'a imam, Zayn al-‚ÄòƒÄbidƒ´n. The specific local branch name was Duparzai. Arif received his primary education at his home town government primary school and later went on to Parachinar to complete his matriculation. Later he got admission into the Madressa Jafria Parachinar from where he went to the Iraqi city of Najaf for further studies, where he also studied under Ayatollah Khomeini in Iraq. In 1973 he returned home and married, and a year later went to the holy city of Qom, Iran to join the Hauza Ilmia. In 1975 and 1977 he went on Haj. Due to his involvement in District Kurram and also for Madressah-e-Jaffaria in Parachinar, Abid Hussain al Hussaini called him for help. He was sent back to Pakistan in 1977 to mobilize the Shia community, and also in that year was the first person to recite a majlis in Pashto, unusual in that the great majority of Pashtuns are Sunni rather than Shia. He also leveraged funding from the Shia Pakistani diaspora in the Persian Gulf to create the Alamdar Foundation in his hometown of Parachinar.

Mackay Edgar was born in Montreal and educated at McGill University. He became a member of the Montreal Stock Exchange. In 1907 he went to Britain on business and stayed, joining Sperling & Co Ltd, merchant bankers, of Moorgate Street, London, in 1908 and later becoming a senior partner. In 1917, he became chairman of British Controlled Oilfields Ltd, remaining in the post until 1925. He was created a baronet in the 1920 New Year Honours, largely due to his services to British-Canadian trade. His financial affairs ran into trouble in 1925 and he went into receivership, although this was rescinded the following year. He left Sperlings at this time and organised his own company, E. Mackay Edgar Ltd, with offices in London, Montreal and New York City. This ended when he retired due to ill-health, but in 1928 he returned with a new company, Beeston's Trust Ltd, which folded during the Depression and in 1931 he again went into receivership. Mackay Edgar was also a notable figure in powerboat racing, owning a number of winning boats. He won the Harmsworth Trophy for two consecutive years (1912 and 1913) with his boat Maple Leaf IV. Mackay Edgar's only son, John, was killed in a car accident in July 1925 and the baronetcy therefore became extinct upon his death.

It was the band's first album since 1986's Dream Come True and was released in the US only. Background Left as the band's only original member, Mike Score worked with many different musicians over the years. He and the members of his band mostly played live shows, but returned with new material with the release of the single \\"Magic\\" in 1989. The band returned to the recording studio in 1994 to begin working on new material, by which time the line-up was made up of Score, Ed Berner on guitar, Dean Pichette on bass and A.J. Mazzetti on drums. While rehearsing the finishing touches for the album, the band came across David Brodie, the vice- president of the fledgling record company Big Shot. Located in Winter Park, Florida, the label was close to the band's home-base and seemed a more viable choice compared to a label further away. Score told the Orlando Sentinel: \\"It happened naturally. They were starting the company, and I was finishing my album.\\" Release The album was released in March 1995 and an album release party was held at Jani Lane's Sunset Strip in Orlando on 26 March. Speaking to The Greenville News in 1995, Score said of The Light at the End of the World: \\"It's become my favorite album - partly because it's new and partly because I think the songwriting has matured. We really put it out for our hardcore fans.\\" Music In contrast to the first two albums from A Flock of Seagulls, but keeping a similar theme to the previous Dream Come True, the songs featured on this album were mainly romantic in theme. Some of the songs, including \\"Burnin' Up\\", \\"Magic\\" and \\"Setting Sun\\", were already being performed live as far back as the late 1980s. The album produced three singles‚Äì\\"Magic\\", \\"Burnin' Up\\" and \\"Rainfall\\"‚Äìwhich all had no chart success (although \\"Rainfall\\" would appear on many compilations for the band). The album also features two New Age instrumentals: \\"The Light at the End of the World\\" and \\"Seven Seas\\". Score recalled of the album to Classic Pop in 2019: \\"A lot of people had been pressuring me to make an album, and I wasn't at my best at that point. I wasn't fully confident, and I made a record so I could clear the decks a bit. It's not the best record, but there are a few good songs on it.\\" Artwork The album's artwork was done by Rifka, who also did the artwork for the single \\"Burnin' Up\\". It depicts a seaside landscape with gulls and an abstract figure in the upper-right corner. Reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album \\"dull, tedious and embarrassing to listen to\\". He added: \\"A Flock Of Seagulls don't write one memorable hook on the entire album and the sound is too polished, too produced, which means it doesn't have a chance of recapturing the glitzy, synthesized spark of new wave.\\" Larry Flick of Billboard reviewed \\"Burnin' Up\\" and wrote: \\"[The] band returns with a synth-pop ditty that could have been pulled from one of its old albums. Given how retro sounds are all the rage, this is not necessarily a detriment to the single's chances - especially since it has a chorus with legs to carry it.\\" Track listingPersonnel ; A Flock of Seagulls *Mike Score ‚Äì keyboards, vocals *Ed Berner ‚Äì guitars *Dean Pichette ‚Äì bass guitar *A.J.

Because the championship is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won or lost competitively but instead by the decision of the bookers of a wrestling promotion. The championship is awarded after the chosen team \\"wins\\" a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport.

It has an elevation of above sea level, making it the highest grassy bald in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The mountain is one of two grassy balds maintained in the range by the park service. The other is Gregory Bald, in the western Smokies. Andrews Bald is a double peak situated along Forney Ridge, just south of Clingmans Dome. The mountain appears in the Clingmans Dome quad on USGS topographical maps. Andrews Bald is the 62nd-highest mountain in North Carolina , and is located entirely within Swain County. Unlike Gregory Bald, the bald area of Andrews doesn't cover the summit, but spreads out around the south slope. How and why grassy balds form is a mystery. While cattle grazing maintained the balds throughout the 19th-century, the forest slowly started reclaiming them after the formation of the national park in the 1930s.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 21. In the early 1980s, the park service polled park visitors regarding the state of the grassy balds, and the response was overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining the balds atop Gregory and Andrews.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 113. The bald area atop Andrews Bald Andrews Bald is probably named after Andres Thompson, an early settler who used the mountain for hunting.George McCoy, Guide to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Asheville: The Inland Press, 1935), 40. A cabin once stood on the southwest slope, near the tip of the present bald area.George McCoy, Guide to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Asheville: The Inland Press, 1935), 41. Herders' shacks were not uncommon in the high-elevation grazing areas of southern Appalachia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1976), 64, 214, e.g. so the cabin may have been a seasonal residence. The Forney Ridge Trail crosses Andrews Bald, passing to within a few feet of the summit, and traverses the entire bald area en route to Springhouse Branch. The trail intersects the Appalachian Trail on the slopes of Clingmans Dome, and can be accessed from the Forney Ridge parking lot. The bald area is just under two miles (3 km) from the parking lot.

Virginia is in Scotland, and unable to return because of the strike, while Mrs Bridges is in Felixstowe on holiday. She telephones 165 Eaton Place, worried about food shortages, and unbeknownst to anyone else, soon orders some food to be delivered to 165. Hudson gets permission from Richard to volunteer as a Special Constable, as he had during the War. Within days on the start of the strike, Edward is attacked by a striker while in the car. Georgina and her circle of friends see the event as a chance to have fun by volunteering to drive buses or trains. James takes it far more seriously, and himself volunteers to drive a bus, and Frederick accompanies him. On one journey they encounter a group of strikers, who are unwilling to let them pass. The conductor on the bus is university student Andrew Bouverie. When Bouverie is briefly at Eaton Place, he remembers having briefly met Georgina at a party, and drops hints about not having anywhere nice to stay. However, Lady Prudence then offers him a bed in her house, as she has decided to help out by becoming a \\"landlord\\", having already got two university students staying. Ruby's uncle Len Finch comes down from Barnsley with a friend Arnold Thompson. Both are down for a delegates meeting. They take tea in the Servants' Hall, when Mr. Hudson is out, and Thompson gives Edward, who is sympathetic to the strikers, a copy of The British Worker newspaper. When Mr Hudson comes back and finds this, he orders it to be burned. On 12 May, minutes after the strike is called off, Len Finch and Arnold Thompson arrive to say goodbye to Ruby. When told of the strike's end, they are both deflated.

The show maintains two different roles: a daily morning show for EMEA and a weekend early breakfast show for the Americas. It airs Mondays to Fridays in 3 parts, 4am to 7:30am, 8am to 9am and 12pm to 1pm GMT, alongside various timeslots during weekends, which also includes a block from 7am to 10am GMT. It is also simulcast on CNN/U.S. (named on-air as Newsroom Live to avoid confusion with the locally based newscast) every Monday from 6am to 8am and on weekends from 8am to 10am GMT. The weekday edition's first hour (or second hour from March to November; named on-air in the Philippines as Newsroom International to avoid confusion with the locally based newscast) is simulcast Mondays to Fridays from 1pm to 2pm PST on CNN Philippines. In Hong Kong, it will be a 30-minute simulcast Mondays to Fridays from 1pm to 1:30pm HKT and Saturdays and Sundays from 12pm to 12:30pm and 5pm to 5:30pm HKT on ViuTVsix. Previous incarnations CNN International's main newscast brand for much of the 1990s was simply called \\"World News\\". In the late 1990s, the network introduced two editions of CNN This Morning. The first edition was broadcast from their studio in Hong Kong, and the second edition was broadcast from their production centre in London. Both editions were intended to be morning programmes for Asia and Europe, respectively. After a revamp of CNN International in 2001, the programme was split into two and was renamed. The Asian programme was named NewsBiz Today, anchored by Kristie Lu Stout and Stan Grant in Hong Kong, while the European programme was named BizNews, and was anchored by Hala Gorani and Richard Quest in London. CNN International underwent another revamp in 2004. In March of that year, NewsBiz Today and BizNews were both renamed to CNN Today. CNN Today (2004‚Äì2009) At its start, the Asian edition ran for three and a half hours (later reduced to just three hours) and the European edition ran for three hours. In both editions, the show had six segments between breaks every hour. At the top of the hour, both editions cover the top stories of the morning. The second segment in the Asian edition takes a look at business headlines and introduces the first of 3 weather updates. Its third and fourth segments looks more in-depth at some top stories. The fifth segment continues with some technology and more business headlines, and sports and lighter stories as well as the business traveler's weather advisory are given before the hour ends. The European edition has its first weather update before the 1st break and continues with major news reports on the 2nd segment. Business stories are reported before the bottom of the hour. At the bottom of the hour, world news headlines are recapped before going to more in-depth coverage of current issues. A 2nd weather report is also presented at this time. Like the Asian edition, sports stories and the business traveler's weather advisory are presented before the top of the hour. In late 2004, the anchor lineups were changed. Monita Rajpal, who was based at CNN Center in Atlanta, moved to London to present the European edition with Richard Quest, while Hala Gorani subsequently moved to Atlanta. In early 2005, Quest stepped down as anchor to become a special correspondent, and Max Foster was hired to anchor the European edition with Rajpal. As for the Asian edition, Stan Grant left CNN in 2012 to return to Australia. Hugh Riminton, another Australian, was hired to anchor the Asian edition with Kristie Lu Stout. During the Riminton-Lu Stout era, the programme won the Asian Television Award for Asia-Pacific's Best News Programme. 2008 refresh CNN International began another revamp of the channel in late 2008. Starting in September, the Asian edition reverted to a single-anchor format. Kristie Lu Stout presented the first two hours, while Hugh Riminton anchored the last hour of the Asian edition and the first hour of the European edition. Also, the European edition was reduced by another 30 minutes for World Sport. The remaining 30 minutes aired after World Sport, and Max Foster anchored those last 30 minutes solo. As a result, Hong Kong produces four hours of CNN Today, while London produces a cumulative two hours of CNN Today. The anchoring lineups changed once again. Lu Stout was on maternity leave for most of the end of 2008, and Kaushal Patel relieved for her. Kristie Lu Stout returned in January 2009, and Patel returned to Atlanta and later left the network. Anna Coren was hired from Seven Network in December 2008, and began presenting the third hour of the programme. On a related note, Hugh Riminton left CNN after four years with the channel and returned to Canberra, Australia to become the chief political correspondent for Network Ten. Kristie Lu Stout anchors the Asian evening bulletins, while Coren anchors mostly the Asian morning bulletins. The newly shortened European edition also changed anchors. Monita Rajpal and Max Foster left the programme in April 2009. Don Riddell, a London- based sport anchor for CNN and Zain Verjee, then CNN State Department correspondent in Washington, became the anchors of the programme. Rajpal now anchors World Report later in the morning, while Foster is a special correspondent and relief anchor for Connect the World, an evening programme and other shows. The European edition now features a new, lighter format for its first 90 continuous minutes. Sasha Herrimen presents a lighter story a few times throughout the programme and often provides a look at the front pages of London's newspapers. The sport update is now shown on the show, and later the morning (Asia/European Time) World Business Today anchored by Charles Hodson and Andrew Stevens appears. World Report (2009‚Äì2013) On September 21, 2009, CNN Today, Your World Today and World News were rebranded as World Report; another television series of the same name was renamed as World View at the same time. Initially, there were multiple editions airing per day, at 0000, 0200, 0500, 0600, 0700, 0800, 0900, 1100, 1200, 1300 and 1700 (all times GMT). However, as CNN International's schedule evolved, these airtimes were reduced to weekend editions, and two separate three-hour morning blocks for Asian and European audiences. Anna Coren and Pauline Chiou anchored the Asian edition during these times. The Asian morning edition of World Report was rebranded as CNN Newsroom in November 2012, to coincide with the revamp of CNN's Hong Kong studio, and the introduction of a new anchor team of Andrew Stevens and Patricia Wu. Asian edition anchor Anna Coren received the 2011 Asian Television Award for \\"Best News Presenter or Anchor\\" for her work on the series.

Early career  Bernard Bonnet was born in Gr√ºnstadt, Germany, where his father, an army officer, was serving. He entered the French civil service as a tax inspector, a post he occupied for five years before being admitted to the prestigious √âcole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) in the \\"Guernica\\" class of 1976. On graduation, he obtained a post at the Interior Ministry. *chief- of-staff to the prefect of Vend√©e (1976-78) *chief-of-staff to the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais (1978-79) *secretary general of the prefecture of the Aude (1979-91) *deputy prefect, responsible for security, at the regional prefecture of Corsica (1991-92)  Prefect of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales  Bernard Bonnet was named as prefect of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales in 1993 by Charles Pasqua. He was strongly opposed to expressions of catalanism in the d√©partement, including the public use of the Catalan language, and his time in Perpignan has been described as \\"five years of absolute rule by a super- prefect\\". in the pseudonymous book Bernard Bonnet, un pr√©fet chez les Catalans After his departure for Corsica, a fake death notice appeared in Catalan in L'Ind√©pendant, the main local newspaper in Perpignan.  Prefect of Corsica  Bernard Bonnet was named as prefect of Corsica by Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement on 9 February 1998, just three days after the assassination of his predecessor Claude Erignac. His role, as announced by Chev√®nement, was to \\"restore the state of law\\", and he quickly showed a firm hand against nationalist groups. He was particularly uncompromising in his use of Article 40 of the Code of Penal Procedure, which obliges civil servants to denounce any illegal activity of which they are aware. . His style brought protests from Corsican politicians, but were generally well received on mainland France... In a session of the Corsican Assembly on 31 October 1998, he was asked ironically by members of the Corsica Nazione group \\"when he was leaving\\": he replied that it would be \\"when your friends stop racketeering, when your friends stop the assassinations at village festivals, when your friends stop planting explosives.\\"  Affair of the beach huts  Bernard Bonnet's career came to an abrupt end in 1999 with the \\"affair of the beach huts\\" (). On the night of 19-20 April 1999, two illegally constructed beach restaurants were destroyed in an arson attack at Cala d'Orzo, south of Ajaccio. Bonnet initially suggested that the attack was a result of a disagreement between armed separatist groups (a common occurrence in Corsica at the time), but the police investigation quickly indicated that the fire had been started by a group of gendarmes from the elite Groupe de peloton de s√©curit√© (GPS). . A walkie- talkie, a compass, a blood-stained balaclava and several jerrycans which had contained petrol were discovered buried in the sand of the beach on 23 April, while a badly-burned patient had been anonymously admitted to the Rangueil University Hospital in Toulouse, transferred from the neighbouring military hospital. Bonnet was arrested on 3 May and flown to Paris for questioning:. he was held in prison on remand (d√©tention pr√©ventive) for two months. After a trial in Ajaccio, he was found guilty of conspiracy to arson (complicit√© de destruction de biens appartenant √† autrui par l'effet d'un incendie) on 10 January 2002 and sentenced to three years of imprisonment, two of which were suspended, and three years deprivation of his civil rights (privation des droits civiques)... Bonnet appealed against his conviction, first to the Court of Appeal in Bastia, which rejected the appeal on 15 January 2003, and then to the Court of Cassation, France's highest court, which rejected his petition on 13 October 2004.Bulletin criminel 2004 N¬∞ 243, p. 885 (Petition no. 03-81763). His request for a Presidential pardon was rejected by Jacques Chirac in March 2005.. Nevertheless, Bonnet never returned to prison as he was granted probation (libert√© conditionnelle) by a Paris judge on 9 June 2006, a decision confirmed on appeal on 12 October 2006.. Neither was he ever sacked from the civil service: he was suspended after his arrest in May 1999, and retired on a normal pension in October 2006.

Biography Porte was born in Brooklyn, New York, to \\"impecunious and unpedigreed\\" second-generation Russian Jewish immigrants and was raised there with his two brothers. Intellectually curious from an early age, he mastered Morse code and obtained, at the age of fourteen, a licence to operate the radio station W2YIR. Attending the selective public Brooklyn Technical High School, Porte excelled not only in English but also in the science of industrial processes, mechanical drawing, and printing technology. Porte enrolled at Cooper Union (1951‚Äì52) after graduating from high school and intended to pursue an engineering career, but left owing to lack of interest and of perceived ability. A paragraph from Mark Van Doren's A Liberal Education (1943) compelled him to switch to literary studies, first at night school at Brooklyn College (1952‚Äì53) and subsequently at the City College of New York. In 1957, he received his A.B. magna cum laude in English and Classics from City College, and won two Claflin medals for excellence in Greek and the Ward Prize in English Composition, besides being elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Admitted to Harvard for graduate studies, Porte studied with Perry Miller, earning and his Ph.D. in 1962 and receiving the Bowdoin Prize for an essay on Emerson. Seven years later, at the age of 36, Porte would become one of the youngest persons to reach the rank of full professor in the history of the Harvard English department. Awarded a Rockefeller Scholarship to Bellagio, Italy (1979), and a Guggenheim Fellowship (1981‚Äì82), Porte's career took him throughout the world as a visiting scholar and lecturer, and also led him to scholarly consultancies with publishers, universities, professional associations, and media groups, and to the editorial boards of leading academic journals. Even though he now moved in the privileged milieu of Ivy League academia, he still remembered the ethnic and economic marginality he experienced in his youth, which disposed him to extend his generosity to others who \\"lacked 'natural' entitlement.\\" In 1987, he resigned as Ernest Bernbaum Professor of Literature and Chair of the Harvard English Department to become the Frederick J. Whiton Professor of American Literature at Cornell. Two years later, Porte was appointed Cornell's Director of American Studies and Ernest I. White Professor of American Studies and Humane Letters. Porte retired from the university in 2004 with the title Emeritus. In recognition of his lifetime contribution to Emerson scholarship, the national Emerson Society granted him the Distinguished Achievement Award in 2006. Porte died in Ithaca, New York, in June, the same year, from esophageal cancer. He was survived by his second wife Helene Sophrin Porte and his only child, Susanna Maria Porte, from his first marriage to Ilana d'Ancona, which had ended in divorce. Contributions to literary scholarship Porte was prolific and original in his contributions to the study of nineteenth-century American literature. He published 12 books, the most highly admired of which were Representative Man (Oxford, 1979; rev. ed., Columbia, 1988), a study of Emerson; In Respect to Egotism: Studies in American Romantic Writing (Cambridge, 1991), and Consciousness and Culture: Emerson and Thoreau Reviewed (Yale, 2004). Porte's approach to Emerson was distinctive, and it remains fresh despite the passage of time. Porte brought a luminous intelligence to the often-overlooked specifics of Emerson's language, tracing vibrant images and motifs through his essays and demonstrating the imaginative power not of Emerson's sometimes hazy concepts, but of what Emerson called a \\"living, leaping Logos.\\" Part of the problem, Porte noted, was the reverential emphasis usually placed on Emerson's character, which could obscure actual attention to his work. In his influential 1973 essay \\"The Problem of Emerson\\"Porte, Joel. \\"The Problem of Emerson\\". In Uses of Literature, ed. Monroe Engel (Harvard University Press, 1973), pp. 85-114; reprinted in Romanticism: Critical Essays in American Literature, ed. James Barbour and Thomas Quirk (Garland, 1986), pp. 59-81. Porte noted that despite the triumph of New Critical methods, Emerson's work \\"has manifestly not been accorded that careful scrutiny of his work as writing which Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Thoreau, Dickinson, Whitman, [and other writers of the American Renaissance]...have received in superabundance.\\" Porte set out to remedy the oversight. Finely attuned to the intricate ebb and flow of Emerson's writing, Porte's criticism revealed Emerson as a writer of stunning depth, power, and complexity. In Representative Man (1979) Porte brought this approach to its culmination, placing Emerson's imagination in fresh cultural and psychological contexts; the book was widely recognized as an enduring achievement. Works edited by Porte included Emerson in His Journals (Belknap, 1982), which presented for the first time in generations a well-edited selection from that sprawling masterwork; the Library of America Emerson (1983); the Cambridge New Essays volume (1990) on Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady; the Cambridge Companion to Ralph Waldo Emerson (1999); and Emerson's Prose and Poetry: a Norton Critical Edition (2001). The last two of these were co-edited with Saundra Morris, a former student of his from Cornell who now teaches at Bucknell. Porte's critical editions of Emerson's works have been staples of college reading lists in the United States, but his influence spread much farther afield. In 2002, the French Ministry of Education decided to prescribe the Norton for the Agr√©gation exam required of prospective college teachers.

Founded in 1951, it was dedicated by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and is Kerala's oldest medical college. The college was known in early records as Medical College (of Thiruvananthapuram), since it was the only medical institute in the state at its inception. Its campus houses several hospitals and institutions in addition to Medical College Hospital (MCH), including the Colleges of Nursing and Pharmaceutical sciences, the Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram Dental College, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology under Govt of India, the Priyadarshini Institute of Paramedical Sciences and the Sree Avittom Thirunal Hospital for Women and Children (SAT Hospital). The Regional Institute of Ophthalmology (RIO), also a part of the college, is being upgraded to a national-level independent institute. The School of Optometry is also on campus.  Location  The college is from the Thiruvananthapuram Central Railway Station and the KSRTC Central Bus Station. The 324,680-square- meter(80.23-acre) campus and hospital are west of Dr. C. O. Karunakaran Avenue (formerly the Kumarapuram-Ulloor Road). Across from the hospital is the Chalakuzhi road, which meets the NH544 near Pattom. The college is about from Trivandrum International Airport.  History = 1948‚Äì1980  In 1948, the government of Travancore appointed a committee to formulate proposals for a medical college at Thiruvananthapuram. The committee submitted its report and the scheme was sanctioned in October of that year. C. O. Karunakaran was appointed Special Officer for the implementation of the scheme, and was the college's first dean. Campus road The campus was , with hillocks surrounded by evergreen coconut groves and paddy fields and facing the sea, from northwestern Thiruvananthapuram city. Its layout and architectural designs were prepared by J. A. Ritchie of Bombay. The college and hospital buildings were separated by playgrounds for football and hockey, a cricket pitch, courts for tennis, basketball, badminton and volleyball, and a 400-meter track. The foundation stone was laid by Raja Pramukh of Travancore‚ÄìCochin at 11:45 am on 26 January 1950, and the first group of students was admitted in August 1951. The college was dedicated by Jawaharlal Nehru at 8:00 am on 27 November 1951. In January 1952, the Sri. Avittom Thirunal Hospital (SATH) was dedicated by Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. A men's hostel opened in 1952, followed by a women's Hostel one year later. The Medical College Hospital was dedicated by Prime Minister Nehru in 1954. The School of Nursing was dedicated by Sethu Lakshmi Bai in 1954, and was upgraded to a college of nursing in 1963.

The Sree Chitra Thirunal Centre, the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Priya Darshini Institute of Paramedical Sciences were established, and the Silver Jubilee Auditorium was built.  1981 to present  A specialty block, housing the college's medical and surgical specialties, became operational on 1 July 2010. The block was funded by the prime minister's Swasthya Suraksha Yojna scheme and by the Kerala government. The 253-bed, specialty block houses the outpatient clinics and inpatient wards of six specialties, eight operating theatres, six 29-bed intensive-care units and dialysis and kidney-transplant units. It is financed and administrated by the Health and Family welfare Department of the government of Kerala. Although the college was initially affiliated with the University of Kerala, since 2010 it has been affiliated with the Kerala University of Health Sciences.  Departments  The college began with departments of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and bacteriology. Dr. C. O. Karunakaran was the first Principal of the college. The departments were headed by V. Mathew, C. Vareed, Narayana Rao and C. O. Karunakaran, respectively. The department of bacteriology initially consisted of microbiology, pathology and hygiene. During the Asian flu epidemic, the department was in the forefront of isolating the influenza virus under R. Ananthanarayanan. In 1981, an AIDS surveillance center was established in the department. The Department of Community Medicine, established in 1953, was the first of its kind in India. A primary health centre for field training was established in July 1953 in Cheruvikkal, which was moved to Pangappara in 1964. Intern training was initially conducted at the Indo-Norwegian MCH unit in Neendakara. The department has a regional cell for the prevention of epidemic and infectious diseases. Forensic medicine which was part of community medicine, became a separate entity in 1966 under V. Kanthasamy. Medico-legal autopsies have been performed since 1955, and the department became a state medico-legal institute in 1986. The department of pharmacology later established an experimental pharmacology wing. The clinical departments of medicine and surgery and the college hospital were established in 1952. Students were initially trained at the general hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. A department of infectious diseases was established in 1983. R. Kesavan Nair, chief surgeon at the general hospital, was appointed professor of surgery and the department of surgery was established. Recognizing the importance of the new specialty of orthopedic surgery, the government of Travancore sent K. I. George of the health services department to the UK for advanced training. George joined the college in 1956, and founded Kerala's first department of orthopedics. The department of pediatrics, initially under general medicine, has the highest number of patients in Kerala. The obstetrics and gynecology department began in 1954 and was later added to the family-planning clinic contraception testing unit, the WHO training center and the infertility clinic.

Zinkernagel speaking at the 2011 Erudite Conclave The college follows the Kerala model of health care. The state has maintained health indices at par with developed nations, well above the national averages. This has been studied by a number of agencies for use in other states of India and developing nations. During the 1950s Asian flu pandemic, it was the principal institute to isolate and research the virus. The college has been upgraded to one of the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences due to its provision of tertiary care to southern India. It has ranked 21st in an India Today survey. The college has a good clinical record, but has been lagged in research. SAT Mix, developed by doctors and nutritionists at SAT Hospital, is used throughout India to manage childhood malnutrition and is a cost-effective measure to reduce infant mortality. The Thiruvananthapuram Development Chart, a scale to assess child development, was developed by the Child Development Center and is recommended for community developmental assessment. The college is one of 15 across India to be connected through the National Knowledge Commission's National Knowledge Network to integrate its knowledge base with the global scientific community.  Erudite Conclave  The college conducted an international Erudite Conclave, the region's first, in November 2011 to provide momentum to medical research. Speakers included Nobel laureate in medicine Rolf M. Zinkernagel, ophthalmologist and inventor of inexpensive intraocular lenses Sanduk Ruit, and SRISTI and techpedia.in founder Anil Kumar Gupta. The second conclave, in 2012, was attended by R. Basant, Padmasree Dr. G. Vijayaraghavan, S. Murti (Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram), R. V. G. Menon, former Indian ambassador T. P. Sreenivasan and Sri Pooyam Tirunal Gowry Parvati Bhai, princess of Travancore.  Student life and activities  The number of male and female students in the college is almost equal. In addition to Kerala, students from Lakshadweep, Northeast India and other parts of the country are admitted by recommendation and under the All India quota. The college hosts exchange students from the Karolinska Institute and other public-health and medical schools. Visitors have included Alexander Fleming, E. Lundsgaard, Karl Evang, Julian Huxley, Wharton Young, Jean Aicardi, David Morley and A. Lakshmana Swamy Mudaliar.  College union  The college union was dedicated in 1952 by Alexander Fleming. Since it is in the state capital, it has been politicized and depoliticized. In accordance with Lyngdoh Committee recommendations, each incoming class selects a representative to the student council (which selects the union).  Events  Athletic Association Day and the college-union inauguration are major campus events. The college has hosted the Kerala University Youth Festival and the Intermedicos Festival several times. Medex public exhibitions were organised in 1974 (as a part of the college's silver-jubilee celebration), 2000, 2001, 2012 and 2017. Annual cultural events (organised by the classes) and sports and games competitions are held on campus. Academic programs include the Erudite Conclave and the Student Medical Research Conference. Intermedicos Genesis 14 was held at the school on 2‚Äì8 December 2014. During the annual Interbatch Euphoria, students from different classes compete in the fields of arts, cultural activities, quizzes and sports.  Graduation  The medical, dental, optometry and nursing colleges organize separate graduation ceremonies. There are no separate graduation ceremonies after postgraduate courses.

It is an 8-storey building (34.0 m), located at the corner of Main Street West and Bay Street South, across the street from the FirstOntario Concert Hall and the Art Gallery of Hamilton. It was officially opened on November 21, 1960. This international style of architecture was designed by architect Stanley Roscoe. Construction was carried out by the Pigott Construction Company, at a cost of 9.4 million dollars. The municipal address of the building is 71 Main Street West. The street number was chosen carefully. Several buildings had been torn down to make way for the new City Hall, so city politicians of the day could choose any odd number between 55 and 105 as the address for the new building. They chose 71 to commemorate the number of years that the old City Hall on James Street North had been in use. Prior to making the decision to construct the new City Hall, council had considered annexing the Lister Block for offices and connecting it to the old City hall via an overhead, enclosed walkway spanning James Street North. In 2005, Hamilton City Council designated the building as a heritage structure. Among the listed heritage elements on the exterior are the Italian glass tile mosaics. Renovation In May 2007, Hamilton City Council directed staff to proceed with the renovation of the building, and the launch phase of the project began in June 2008.

The text follows the wanderings and creative endeavors of Toloki, a self- employed professional mourner, as he traverses an unnamed South African city during the nation's transitional period. Ways of Dying examines the concepts of nation-building after the communal trauma of Apartheid. It is an examination of the interregnum period in South African history. Mda experiments with magical realism, using it to highlight the interplay of tragedy and laughter in confronting crisis, and the conflicts between social classes and government authority. Plot The novel takes place in an unnamed South African city, five years after the first elections to occur after Apartheid. Toloki, an itinerant professional mourner, contemplates the various forms of violence plaguing the shantytowns in which he works. He runs into Noria, whom he had known as a child from his home village, while mourning at her son Vutha's funeral, the second funeral she has had for a child. The two move in together and start a relationship, each claiming the other knows and can teach how to live. Criticism Grant Farred, writing in Modern Fiction Studies, criticized Mda for his implicit condemnation of the historical, violent tactics used to resist Apartheid. Farred characterizes this lack of sympathy with historical actors as typical of Post-Apartheid viewpoints. Alternatively, Rita Barnard praised the book for what she believed to be an \\"optimistic\\" tone, stating that it did not \\"offer a ratification of received codes of conduct\\". Further, she praised the novel's lightness, and its willingness to replace a \\"sober militancy with gaiety and laughter\\".

July 1984) were found in Solna, north of Stockholm, in 1984. Da Costa had been dismembered, and parts of her body were found in plastic bags on 18 July and 7 August. The case is known as Styckmordsr√§tteg√•ngen ('the dismemberment murder trial'). How da Costa died has not been established as her vital organs and head have never been found.  Background  Da Costa, who worked as a prostitute in Stockholm in early 1984, disappeared during Pentecost on 10 June, or soon thereafter. On 18 July, the first parts of her dismembered body were discovered under a highway overpass in Solna, just outside Stockholm; additional body parts were discovered elsewhere on 7 August. Da Costa's body was identified by her fingerprints. Her head, internal organs, one breast and genitalia have never been found, and no cause of death could be determined from what was found. Shortly thereafter, Teet H√§rm, a pathologist in a forensics laboratory at Karolinska Institutet, was suspected of the crime. He was known to meet prostitutes, and his workplace was between the two places where the victim's body was found. He was arrested and released. At this time, the wife of Thomas Allgen, a general practitioner, alerted the police that their 17-month-old daughter might be an incest victim. Pediatric examinations found no evidence of abuse, and the doctor and his wife separated in late 1984. Later in 1985, the wife told police that her daughter had begun talking about witnessing a dismemberment. Since the pathologist and the general practitioner knew each other superficially, the police connected the cases. The following trials were largely based on the then-2¬Ω-year-old child's stories, interpreted by her mother and evaluated by a child psychologist and child psychiatrist. In 1986, police resources were stretched thin after the murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, and the dismemberment case was shelved until the following year. H√§rm and Allgen were arrested in late 1987 and brought to trial in January 1988.  Trials  The first trial ended in a mistrial after the lay judges were interviewed for the newspaper Aftonbladet on 9 March 1988 and commented on the court's justification for its judicial decision. In a second trial, the lower court asked the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare to investigate the circumstances of the case and found that da Costa's cause of death was unknown. As a result, the two defendants were acquitted, since it could not be established that da Costa died under suspicious circumstances. Although in its verdict the court found that the defendants had dismembered the victim's body, the statute of limitations for that crime had expired. On 23 May 1989, the Swedish authority for medical- negligence assessment rescinded the doctors' right to work, and its ruling was upheld in a 1991 appeal. The doctors have appealed to several courts, including the Supreme Court of Sweden, the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden (Regeringsr√§tten) and the European Court of Human Rights, none of which have overturned the ruling.  Aftermath  The case has been the focus of several books, investigative articles and television documentaries. Journalist Per Lindeberg published D√∂den √§r en man (Death is a Man) in 1999, questioning the police investigation and contending that the men were victims of a miscarriage of justice caused partially by extensive media coverage. In 2003 journalist Lars Borgn√§s published Sanningen √§r en s√§llsynt g√§st (Truth is a Rare Guest), opposing Lindeberg's position and theorizing that da Costa was murdered by a serial killer. In 2006, the doctors demanded 40 million kronor (about US$4.8 million) in damages for loss of income during the years they could not practice and for defamation. Their demand was refused when the Chancellor of Justice, who handles questions of voluntary damages, ruled that such a large claim should be handled by the courts. On 3 April 2007, the two men's attorney registered their claim for 35 million kronor in damages at the Attunda lower court. On 30 November 2009 the trial of the Swedish state began, ending shortly before Christmas. In an 18 February 2010 judgement, the court ruled that the doctors were not entitled to damages. Da Costa's murder has inspired multiple works of fiction, such as Stieg Larsson's internationally successful crime novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and work by Katarina Frostenson and Sara Stridsberg. The statute of limitations for the killing expired in 2009 and prosecutors suspended their investigations on 1 July that year.

Tellers are also known as scrutineers, poll- watchers, challengers or checkers. They should be distinguished from polling agents and counting agents who officially represent candidates. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, tellers work on behalf of political parties (usually as volunteers). They stand or sit outside the polling station and collect electoral registration numbers (poll numbers) of voters as they enter or leave. They play no official part in the election and voters are under no obligation to speak with them. They are not polling agents, so they have no official rights, such as to enter the polling station. If asked, the tellers must explain they are not officials and why they are collecting poll numbers. Tellers help their parties identify supporters who have not yet voted, so that they can be contacted and encouraged to vote, and offered assistance‚Äîsuch as transport to the polling station‚Äîif necessary. In as far as this increases turn-out, it can be said to be \\"good\\" for the democratic process, since a higher voter turnout is generally considered desirable. Police officers may intervene if tellers \\"irritate voters, exert undue influence or obstruct the polling station.\\" Sometimes, some or all of the main parties might reach an agreement to take shifts, and pass on their lists to the other parties; however it is commonplace to see several tellers outside a polling station. After the May 2005 Northern Ireland elections, the Electoral Commission concluded that some candidates' polling agents unlawfully assisted with identifying supporters who had not yet voted, by passing information from inside the polling place to other party workers. This information is not normally available to parties unless voters give it voluntarily to tellers.  Other assemblies  In other deliberative assemblies, such as voluntary associations, elections and other matters of importance are frequently voted on by ballot. Tellers are appointed to count those ballots. Normally, the chairman appoints the tellers unless the organization's rules provide that tellers are appointed another way, such as appointment of an elections committee. The tellers are chosen for their accuracy and dependability, are not directly involved on what is being voted in, and usually are allowed to vote themselves.

Summary Victoria Station consists of a radio dialogue between a minicab controller (or dispatcher) and a driver (#274) who is stopped by the side of \\"a dark park\\" in Crystal Palace, supposedly waiting further instructions. The stage directions Lights up on office. CONTROLLER sitting at microphone and Lights up on DRIVER in car (45) alternate between these settings. The controller attempts to instruct the driver to pick up a client from Victoria Station, but the driver declines to move, focusing on his current client (who is apparently unmoving, perhaps even dead, in the back seat). The Controller's mood shifts through various degrees of mystification towards irritation and then possibly compassion masking some more nefarious intention of what to do with this Driver. Lasting fewer than ten minutes, the play's tone is mostly comic, as the Controller becomes more and more frantic at the Driver's recalcitrance; however, as the play develops, the Controller's orders become increasingly ominous threats: \\"Drop your passenger. Drop your passenger at his chosen destination and proceed to Victoria Station. Otherwise I'll destroy you bone by bone. I'll suck you in and blow you out in little bubbles. I'll chew your stomach out with my own teeth. I'll eat all the hair off your body. You'll end up looking like a pipe cleaner? Get me?\\" (58). But Driver reveals that this client is a young female with whom he has \\"fallen in love\\" (possibly \\"for the first time\\") and from whom he refuses to part, imagining that he will even marry her and that they will \\"die together in this car\\", despite the previous admission that he is already married to a wife probably \\"asleep in bed\\" and the father of (perhaps) \\"a little daughter\\"‚Äî\\"Yes, I think that's what she is\\" (55). The play becomes more somber in tone, as the Controller tries to assure the fearfully insecure Driver that all will be fine, finally cajoling him to \\"stay exactly where\\" he is, as the Controller prepares to leave \\"this miserable freezing fucking office\\"‚Äîobsessed in turn by the Driver and the fact that \\"nobody loves me\\"‚Äîin search of him, saying that he imagines them sharing a holiday together on Barbados (59). In response to the Driver's repeated plea, \\"Don't leave me\\" (53‚Äì54), the Controller may be prepared to \\"help\\" him (as he insists), but one may still wonder if he might actually retain some more menacing possibility (60‚Äì62). Premiere It was first performed at the National Theatre, London, on 14 October 1982. The performers were Paul Rogers as the Controller and Martin Jarvis as the Driver. The same cast recorded a radio version for BBC Radio 3, directed by John Tydeman and first transmitted on 15 August 1986. Publication The sketch is published in Other Places: Three Plays, including also A Kind of Alaska and Family Voices (Grove Press, 1983), and also in Other Places: Four Plays by Harold Pinter (Dramatists Play Service, 1984). Subsequent productions Douglas Hodge directed Robert Glenister and Rufus Sewell in a 15-minute film version, released in 2003 by Alcove Entertainment. Victoria Station was among the short works included in a 2007 London production entitled Pinter's People, in which Bill Bailey played the minicab controller and Kevin Eldon played the cab driver.Martha Kearney,\\"Theatre: Pinter's People, Theatre Royal Haymarket\\", Newsnight Review, BBC Two, 2 Feb. 2007, Web, 18 June 2009.

This trackage was acquired by the B&O; as part of the purchase of the Buffalo & Susquehanna Railroad (B&S;) in 1932. It is known as the operator of a set of GE centercab diesels supplemented by F7 locomotives in later years.  History WAG boxcar The original Wellsville, Addison & Galeton Railroad (WA&G;) consisted of two main lines originating from Galeton, Pennsylvania. One ran northwest to Wellsville, New York, where it connected to the Erie Railroad; the other ran northeast to Addison, New York and also connected to the Erie. Two short segments completed the trackage, one running east to Ansonia, Pennsylvania and a connection with the New York Central Railroad, and another southwest to Burrows, representing the stub end of the former connection to the B&O.; This totalled 91 miles of trackage and was sold for $250,000, along with six ex-B&S; steam locomotives, four cabooses, and a miscellany of work equipment, to the H.E. Salzberg Company, which operated a number of other short lines. Operations began in 1956. The future of the line was driven by line conditions and traffic. Major customers included a Sinclair refinery in Wellsville and tanneries in Elkland and Westfield. These latter supplied the sobriquet of \\"The Sole Leather Line\\", which was painted on some equipment. The Burrows branch was abandoned soon after WA&G; began operations. The Elkland-Addison portion followed in 1960. In 1964 the line expanded to include the Coudersport & Port Allegany Railroad (C&PA;), which crossed at Newfield Junction on the Wellsville line. The CP&A; was abandoned in 1973. By the time Hurricane Agnes hit the northeast in 1972, WA&G; was reduced to a 40-mile operation between Galeton to Elkland, with a branch (and its only outside connection) to Ansonia. A fire destroyed the Elkland tannery in 1973; and after more floods the railroad filed for abandonment in 1975. Approval to abandon was granted by the ICC in 1978, and the final freight ran on March 13, 1979. The line remained open until November to retrieve equipment and ship locomotives to various buyers.  Equipment  The B&O; supplied six class E-60 Consolidations (built in 1907-1908) as part of the original sale. The new railroad intended to use diesel power instead, and only one of the six (#3127) was ever lettered for the WA&G.; However, the first diesels purchased, a pair of Whitcomb 75-tonners, proved inadequate for the grades on the Wellsville line, and so the steamers were pressed into service briefly at the opening of the line, only to be scrapped in 1955-56. More adequate power came in as a series of General Electric centercab models. The first, a 50-ton unit, served briefly at the opening of the line; then in 1955 a pair of 125-ton units were purchased from Ford, to be joined by five 132-ton units the following year. These were retired in stages through the 1960s, and all were scrapped by 1973 except for #1700 which is preserved at the Lake Shore Railway Museum in North East, PA. Starting in 1968 as the centercabs wore out, they were replaced by a series of F7 units, all of which came as trade-in units from General Electric. Through 1972, a total of eight units were purchased, including one B unit (for parts) and an FP7A. Only two were retained by the WA&G; all others were transferred to the Louisiana & North West Railroad, another Salzberg line. In 1978, the WA&G;'s two steel cabooses joined the F7s in Louisiana; the older wooden cabooses are now in private hands. Like a number of short lines in the late 1950s, the WA&G; made a profitable business out of cars in interchange service. This began with a purchase of 78 wooden boxcars, and eventually 761 cars were in service. These cars grew less profitable through the years, and the refusal of Penn Central to renew a lease of 300 wooden cars put an end to their use, though metal- sided cars remained in service.  Surviving Equipment  The WA&G; was beset by fire and flood over the years, and little physical evidence of the line remains. However, three of the F7 units went to museums and two were included in a group which ended up with the Connecticut Department of Transportation (currently stored on the Naugatuck Railroad). Three of the line's cabooses are known to survive in private ownership. Former snowplow X-3710 is currently stored at the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum. GE 132 ton centercab locomotive WAG#1700 (ex-Ford #1006), the only one still in existence, is preserved at the Lake Shore Railway Historical Society Museum in North East, Pennsylvania, 10 miles from the GE locomotive assembly plant that built it.

(See the Protestant Reformation in France, vol. ii., page 352) (1851-52) is the full, exhibited title, of a painting by John Everett Millais, and was produced at the height of his Pre- Raphaelite period. It was accompanied, at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1852, with a long quote reading: \\"When the clock of the Palais de Justice shall sound upon the great bell, at daybreak, then each good Catholic must bind a strip of white linen round his arm, and place a fair white cross in his cap.‚ÄîThe order of the Duke of Guise.\\" This long title is usually abbreviated to A Huguenot or A Huguenot, on St Bartholomew's Day.Jason Rosenfeld, John Everett Millais, Phaidon Press Ltd., 2012, pp. 35, 66-8, 71-2, 74-5, 84, 88, 91, 111-12, 114, 133, 146. It depicts a pair of young lovers and is given a dramatic twist because the girl, who is Catholic, is attempting to get her beloved, who is a Protestant, to wear the white armband declaring allegiance to Roman Catholicism. The young man firmly pulls off the armband at the same time that he gently embraces his lover, and stares into her pleading eyes. The incident refers to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre on August 24, 1572, when around 3,000 French Protestants (Huguenots) were murdered in Paris, with around 20,000 massacred across the rest of France. A small number of Protestants escaped from the city through subterfuge by wearing white armbands. Millais had initially planned simply to depict lovers in a less dire predicament, but supposedly had been persuaded by his Pre-Raphaelite colleague William Holman Hunt that the subject was too trite. After seeing Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera Les Huguenots of 1836 at Covent Garden, which tells the story of the massacre, Millais adapted the painting to refer to the event. In the opera, Valentine attempts unsuccessfully to get her lover Raoul to wear the armband.Tate Gallery, The Pre-Raphaelites, 1984, p.99 The choice of a pro- Protestant subject was also significant because the Pre-Raphaelites had previously been attacked for their alleged sympathies to the Oxford Movement and to Catholicism.Alastair Grieve, The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Anglican High Church, \\"The Burlington Magazine\\", Vol. 111, No. 794 (May, 1969), pp. 292+294-295 Millais painted the majority of the background near Ewell in Surrey in the late summer and autumn of 1851, while he and Hunt were living at Worcester Park Farm. It was from a brick wall adjoining an orchard.Tim Barringer, Jason Rosenfeld, and Alison Smith, Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde, Tate Publishing, 2012, p. 61. Some of the flowers depicted in the scene may have been chosen because of the contemporary interest in the so-called language of flowers. The blue Canterbury Bells at the left, for example, can stand for faith and constancy. Returning to London after the weather turned too cold to work out-of-doors in November, he painted in the figures: the face of the man was from that of Millais's family friend Arthur Lempri√®re, and the woman was posed for by Anne Ryan. The painting was exhibited with Ophelia and his portrait of Mrs. Coventry Patmore (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1852, and helped to change attitudes towards the Pre-Raphaelites. Tom Taylor wrote an extremely positive review in Punch. It was produced as a reproductive print by the dealer D. White and engraved in mezzotint by Thomas Oldham Barlow in 1856. This became Millais's first major popular success in this medium, and the artist went on to produce a number of other paintings on similar subjects to serve a growing middle class market for engravings.Jason Rosenfeld and Alison Smith, Millais, Tate Publishing, 2007, pp. 68, 76, 94-6, 110, 112; no. 57. These include The Order of Release, 1746 (Tate, London), The Proscribed Royalist, 1651 (Lord Lloyd-Webber Collection), and The Black Brunswicker (Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight). All were successfully engraved. There are smaller watercolor versions of the picture in the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery, Bedford, the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, and a reduced oil replica in the Lord Lloyd- Webber Collection, all by Millais.

A spectrometer in combination with a position- sensitive microchannel plate detector is used to count ions (with the MCP) while scanning their energy (using the spectrometer). The experiment is located at the ISOLDE Radioactive Ion Beam Facility in CERN. The beam from ISOLDE is bunched by REXTRAP after which it is transferred to the WITCH set- up.  Working principle  The ion bunch from REXTRAP is slowed in a pulsed drift cavity in the vertical beamline. After this the bunch is injected into the magnetic field. Here the ion cloud is trapped in the first Penning trap (for cooling). Its purpose is to cool down the ions with buffer gas. In this trap, it is possible to apply different excitation modes (dipolar, quadrupolar and octopolar). The ions are then transferred to the second Penning trap (in which decays are studied). When an ion decays, it can escape the decay trap into the spectrometer. The spectrometer consists out of a set of electrodes to create an electrical potential barrier. If the decayed ion's energy is high enough, it will be able to overcome this barrier to be detected at the top of the setup.  Physics goal  The first goal of the experiment is to measure the so-called beta-neutrino correlation. This is indirectly done by measuring the shape of the spectrum of the recoiling ions. This beta-neutrino correlation can provide, if measured precisely, information about fundamental weak interaction properties. According to the Standard Model the weak interaction has a Vector‚ÄìAxial vector structure. But there are other mathematical possibilities which have not been detected in nature yet. The WITCH experiment will search for scalar currents in the first place. But it is also possible to look for tensor currents. Other physics goals are the search for heavy neutrinos, measuring Fermi/Gamov-Teller mixing ratios, measuring electron capture probabilities, etc.  References  * WITCH Homepage Category:Particle experiments Category:CERN experiments ","title":"WITCH experiment"},{"id":"10437864","text":"Amblyeleotris harrisorum is a species of goby currently only recorded from reefs around the island of Kiritimati in the Line Islands, Republic of Kiribati, in the central Pacific at a depth of around .

This dramatic sketch is a duologue between a married couple \\"in their forties\\" (54). As they \\"sit with coffee\\" (54), they reminisce about when they first met and fell in love during their youth. The tone of the sketch is both gently comic and wistful, as Pinter exposes some present emotional disjunction between the characters through their dialogue about their past, which they remember differently. They have at least one child, as the wife thinks she \\"heard a child crying, [‚Ä¶] a child, waking up\\" in their house, whereas the husband responds, \\"There was no sound.

History The association was created in 1905 as the gymnastics clubs Turnverein Jahn Emsdetten and Turnverein Eichenlaub which merged in 1908 to become Turnverein Deutsche Einigkeit. Turnverein Emsdetten 09 was formed in 1909 and it already had a football department. Deutsche Einigkeit and Emsdetten 09 eventually merged in 1922, becoming TuS Deutsche Einigkeit. The footballers left to form a separate club called Spielverein Emsdetten in 1924 and adopted the name Spielvereinigung Emsdetten in 1935. The club has played amateur football throughout its history and came close to advancing into the third division Landesliga Westfalen, then the highest amateur class in German football, when they met TSV H√ºls in a 1949 playoff before 10,00 spectators. Emsdetten did later find its way into the Landesliga, playing two seasons there from 1954 to 1956. Re-structuring of German football leagues helped push the club down to lower levels of competition. In 1970 they rose to play in the Verbandsliga Westfalen (IV) and would move up to become a third division side after league re-organization in 1978, playing in the Oberliga Westfalen (III). A next-to-last place finish in 1980 would drive the club back down to the Verbandsliga, but success in regional cup play earned Emsdetten a place in the 1980‚Äì81 German Cup competition where they went out 0:6 in the first round to 1. FC K√∂ln. Several years spent in fifth division competition ended in 1991 when the club was relegated to the Landesliga Westfalen (VI). SpVgg began to climb its way back up in 2000, returning to the then fifth tier Verbandsliga before a second- place result there in 2002 qualified the team to play in the Oberliga Westfalen (IV) where they competed as a lower-to-mid table side. In 2007 they were dropped back to the Verbandsliga, which became a sixth tier competition and was renamed Westfalenliga the next year with the introduction of 3. Liga as the new third tier. Two successive relegations by the early 2010s returned them to the Landesliga (VII) and dropped them further to the Bezirksliga (VIII) before a district championship in the latter league in 2013 put them back in the Landesliga where they played until 2017, when they went back to the Bezirksliga. SpVgg Emsdetten delivers its home matches in the Salvus- Stadion am Grevener Damm which has a capacity of 5,000 (~200 seats). The club currently has a membership of 1,000.
