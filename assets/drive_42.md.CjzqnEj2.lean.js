It was the last remaining station operated by the former Granada Sky Broadcasting joint venture, set up by Granada Television (now part of ITV plc) and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting in 1996. Although ITV plc is now the sole owner of GSB (since renamed ITV Digital Channels Limited), Sky will receive 49.5 per cent of any proceeds (net of liabilities) if Men & Motors is sold. A possible merger with ITV4 had been on the cards, but in September 2007 ITV confirmed that it planned to dispose of Men & Motors. Men & Motors closed on 1 April 2010 to make way for ITV HD on Freesat, Sky Digital and Virgin Media. Carriage First Men & Motors logo, used from 1 October 1996 to 31 August 1998. From its launch, Men & Motors was only available with subscription television services. It was part of the original line-up (as a \\"primary channel\\") for ITV Digital, a Digital terrestrial television service part-owned by Granada. When ONdigital closed, Men & Motors left DTT and became available only through satellite and cable. On 1 November 2004, ITV took full control of GSB and shut down Plus, which only averaged 0.7% of its audience share before ITV3 replaced this ill-fated channel. The channel really took off after the appointment of Gary Shoefield as director of programming. He quickly set about changing the presenters and the look and feel and took responsibility for both the acquisitions and the newly produced programmes. The channel was split into 2 distinctive halves with Motors content before 11 pm and Adult content thereafter. Second Men & Motors logo, used from 1 September 1998 to 11 August 2001. Shoefield brought Jordan (Katie Price) to the Adult part of the channel along with Jo Guest, Catherine McQueen, Mike Reid, Roy \\"Chubby\\" Brown, Garry Bushell and James Whale. Names that joined the Motors team included Gary Numan, Vanilla Ice, Ginny Buckley, Richard Hammond, John Inverdale and Princess Tamara. The channel saw huge growth under Shoefield's control and Men and Motors became a household name until November 2004, when ITV acquired GSkyB and rebranded Plus as ITV3. Many years after the closure of ITV Digital, ITV (the company formed by the merger of Carlton Television and Granada) successfully bid for a slot on digital terrestrial (DTT) multiplex D. It was announced that Men & Motors would be launched on Freeview on 2 May 2005. To coincide with this launch, the channel was re-vamped, and its late night, risqu√© adult content was replaced by archive drama, comedy and documentaries. The channel also dropped its Videoguard encryption on Sky Digital on 1 July 2005, switching to free-to-air status. ITV's plans to launch a channel aimed at men (the target audience of Men & Motors) were considered by many to be the end for Men & Motors. It seemed logical that Men & Motors would simply \\"become\\" ITV4, with much of the channel's programming simply being shown under the ITV brand. With capacity on the Freeview platform limited, and to avoid being in competition for the same genre of viewers, this seemed the inevitable conclusion. However, available to a much wider audience, Men & Motors enjoyed a (slightly unexpectedly) sharp increase in viewing figures. ITV were faced with the conundrum of replacing a channel with a well-known brand and enjoying a new popularity with a new, seemingly identical channel. ITV4 instead replaced the ITV News Channel on Freeview (between its broadcasting hours of 18:00 to 06:00), with Men & Motors still available on its own 24-hour slot. The News channel closed soon after, due to major competition from Sky News and BBC News 24 and heavy financial losses. It was replaced fully by ITV4 and the CITV Channel. After less than a year on Freeview, Men & Motors had now been replaced. At 06:00 BST on 12 April 2006, Men & Motors ceased transmissions on digital terrestrial television. This was to allow ITV to launch the \\"participation television\\" channel, ITV Play, which has since been closed down itself. With limited bandwidth on the platform, and a desire to keep the entire ITV \\"family\\" (i.e. all channels carrying the ITV brand) on the free platform, Men & Motors was only available on satellite and cable television at the time of its closure. On 2 April 2010, ITV HD launched on Sky Digital channel 178, replacing Men & Motors. As a result, Men & Motors closed on 1 April at 6 a.m. on both Freesat and Sky Digital. On Virgin Media, Men & Motors was removed from the EPG on 25 March 2010 for \\"operational reasons\\" to add an ITV HD launch information screen. Most of the programmes that were shown on Men & Motors moved over to ITV4. On 11 December 2012, One Media iP announced that they had acquired all of the trademarks and content rights of Men & Motors, including approximately 1,600 hours of programming. One Media are currently re-packaging the content for sale across a variety of digital platforms including the iTunes Store and YouTube.

It required the federal government to favor returning war veterans when hiring new employees in an attempt to recognize their service, sacrifice, and skills.  Preference before the Civil War  The use of preference in Federal appointments extends back to the days of the Revolutionary War. Though no legal basis existed to govern the treatment of war veterans, certain soldiers were rewarded for their service by the Federal government. Early forms of preference were often based on European models and featured the use of pensions, bonuses for service, disability allowance, and hospitalization for injuries incurred while in uniform, as rewards for service to one's country. It wasn't until the heyday of the spoils system, however, that appointments to Federal positions as a reward for military service become a popular practice. These appointments, however, were usually reserved for ex-officers, and not for the rank and file soldier.  Civil War to the end of World War I  Towards the end of the Civil War, Congress passed the first significant veterans' preference legislation. This act provided that: Under this legislation, preference in appointments was limited to disabled veterans who were otherwise qualified for the work to be performed. This 1865 law stood as the basic preference legislation until the end of World War I. Along the way, however, several modifications were made to the 1865 legislation. An amendment in 1871 contained the first instance of \\"suitability\\" requirements for job seeking veterans. The language read as follows: In 1876, another Congressional amendment gave preference for RIF retention to veterans, their widows, and their orphans. This amendment marked the introduction of the use of preference as RIF protection. It provided: Determination of the \\"equal qualifications\\" of a person entitled to preference under this law was left to the appointing officer. In 1888, a Civil Service Commission regulation gave absolute preference to all disabled veterans over all other eligibles. In other words, they would qualify with a score of 65, when the minimum passing score for everyone else was a 70, and would be placed at the top of the certification list. A year later, President Harrison issued an Executive Order allowing honorably discharged veterans who were former Federal employees to be reinstated without time limit. This was the first appearance of reinstatement eligibility as applied to veterans. In 1892, reinstatement rights were extended to the widows and orphans of veterans. The reinstatement provision was the last significant addition to preference legislation until 1919.  Preference between the World Wars  The first major expansion of Veterans' Preference benefits occurred in 1919 in the form of the Census Act. This act, amended shortly thereafter by the Deficiency Act of 1919 granted preference to all honorably discharged veterans, their widows, and the wives of injured veterans. An excerpt reads as follows: This act is significant for two reasons: it no longer emphasized a service-connected disability as the primary basis for granting veterans' preference, and it introduced the concept of spousal preference in the appointing process. This act redefined eligible veterans to mean all persons who served in an active military capacity and were honorably discharged, whether the service was in wartime or peacetime. Added were their widows and the wives of those too disabled to qualify for government employment. This act remained the basic Federal law for appointment preference until June 27, 1944, when the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 was enacted. Two significant modifications were made to the 1919 Act. In 1923, an Executive Order was created which added 10 points to the score of disabled veterans and added 5 points to the scores of non-disabled veterans. This was the first time the points were added to the examination scores in the appointing process. Under this Executive Order, however, veterans were no longer placed at the top of the certification lists. In 1929, another executive order restored the placement of 10 point disabled veterans to the top of certification lists. In 1938, a Civil Service Commission rule required that the decision by an appointing official to pass over a veteran and select a non-veteran for appointment be subject to review by the commission. Language regarding the pass-over of eligible veterans existed in earlier executive orders, but these early versions only required that the CSC be notified if a pass-over occurred. The 1938 rule strengthened this requirement and marked the first time that the Commission could overturn the pass-over if it did not regard the reasons as being adequate.  Veterans' Preference Act of 1944  Veterans' preference, as it exists today, derives from the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944. This act, to a large extent, resulted from the veterans organizations' desire to elevate the existing Executive and regulatory orders governing preference to the level of National policy. With a victorious end to World War II clearly in sight, both Congress and the Administration were sympathetic to the veterans organizations' objective. In his endorsement of the legislation, President Roosevelt wrote, \\"I believe that the Federal Government, functioning in its capacity as an employer, should take the lead in assuring those who are in the armed forces that when they return special consideration will be given to them in their efforts to obtain employment. It is absolutely impossible to take millions of our young men out of their normal pursuits for the purpose of fighting to preserve the Nation, and then expect them to resume their normal activities without having any special consideration shown them.\\" The act, in essence, was a consolidation of the various preference provision already in effect by the various Executive Orders and CSC regulations. It went a step further by broadening and strengthening existing veterans' preference rules by giving them legislative sanction. Thus, the Executive Branch could no longer change the provisions of veterans' preference. Any changes must now be sought through legislation. In addition, the act made clear that preference was to be a reward for patriotic duties by a grateful country willing to recognize the sacrifices of its servicemen when peace comes. The Act would help ensure that veterans obtain or regain an economic position they otherwise would have attained had they not served in the armed forces. The Veterans preference Act of 1944 defined to whom and under what circumstances preference would be granted. It provided that Preference be given in competitive examinations, in appointments to positions in the Federal service, in reinstatement to positions, in reemployment, and in retention during reductions in force. Preference would apply to civilian positions -- permanent or temporary ;-- in all departments, agencies, bureaus, administrations, establishments, and projects of the Federal Government, and in the civil service of the District of Columbia. Further, the law provided that preference apply to positions in the classified civil service (now the competitive service), the unclassified civil service (positions excepted from the competitive service), and in any temporary or emergency establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project and department created by acts of Congress or Presidential Executive order. The legislative and judicial branches of the Government, as well as positions in the executive branch, which are required to be confirmed by the United States Senate, except Postmaster-ships, in the first-, second-, and third-class post offices were exempt from the Act. The Act originally granted preference to non-disabled veterans, disabled veterans, wives of disabled veterans, and the widows of disabled veterans. These were substantially the same groups granted preference under previous laws and regulations with two exceptions. Non- disabled veterans whose only service was performed during peacetime and the wives of non-service-connected disabled veterans over 55 years of age were no longer eligible for preference.  Veterans' Preference since 1944  In 1948, the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 was amended to include the mothers of veterans. Mother preference was granted to certain widowed, divorced, or legally separated mothers of veterans (men and women) who * (a) died under honorable conditions while on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States in wartime or in peacetime campaigns or expeditions for which campaign badges or service medals have been authorized; or * (b) have permanent and total service-connected disabilities which disqualify them for civil service appointment to positions along the general line of their usual occupations. In the case of such widowed mothers, preference was granted provided they were widowed at the time of death or disability of the veteran and had not remarried. The divorced or legally separated mothers were granted preference only if the veteran was the mother's only child. This provision was later amended in 1950 to allow preference to mothers who are living with their husbands but whose husbands are totally and permanently disabled. In 1952, a bill was passed granting preference benefits to those honorably separated veterans who served on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States during the period beginning April 28, 1952 and ending July 1, 1955 (the period after the termination of the state of war between the United States and the Government of Japan during which persons could be inducted under existing law for training and service in the armed forces). The bill also extended preference to the widows and mothers of such veterans. The Vietnam War in the 1960s resulted in several modifications of the VP law of 1944. In 1966, legislation was passed which granted peace-time preference for Vietnam-era vets who served on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days between January 31, 1955 and October 10, 1976; National guard and reserve service was excluded from this legislation. In 1967 legislation was passed which expanded preference to all veterans who served on active duty for more than 180 days (no requirement to serve during war, campaign, or conflict) between January 31, 1955 and October 10, 1976. As with the previous year's law, National guard and reserve service was not included in this expansion. The end of the Vietnam War brought with it yet another law, passed in 1976. This law put added restrictions on veterans whose service begins after October 14, 1976. For post-Vietnam era veterans, preference was granted only if these veterans became disabled, or served in a declared war, a campaign, or expedition. This legislation was the result of the conclusion of the Vietnam War and its draft and the United States Department of Defense's desire to build a career military service. The Civil Service reform act of 1978 created new benefits for veterans with a 30 percent or more disability. It also gave veterans extra protection in hiring and retention. Under this act, preference was no longer granted to nondisabled veterans who retired at the rank of major or above. In 1988, a law was passed that required the Department of Labor to report agencies' violations of veterans' preference and failure to list vacancies with State employment services to the Office of Personnel Management for enforcement. The last major legislation affecting veterans' preference occurred in the form of the Defense Appropriations act of 1997. Under this legislation, preference was accorded to anyone who served on active duty during the Gulf War period (August 2, 1990 through January 2, 1992). This law also granted preference to certain service members who earned campaign medals for service in Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Endeavor (November 20, 1995 through December 20, 1996) or Operation Joint Guard (December 20, 1996 through a date designated by the Secretary of Defense).

Early life Owens was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, and was educated at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music (now a part of Griffith University) and at the University of Sydney. She was a production manager at the Lyric Opera of Queensland from 1985 to 1989 and senior program officer at the Australia Council from 1989 to 1993. She then became a small-business owner and CEO of the Association of Australian Independent Record Labels (AIR) before entering Parliament. Politics Owens' first foray into politics came in 1996, when she stood as the Labor candidate in Division of North Sydney. She was given very little chance of winning, given that North Sydney has long been a conservative stronghold, and was soundly defeated by Liberal Joe Hockey. In the 2004 election campaign, Owens ran against the incumbent Liberal Ross Cameron. The campaign was notable for the admission by Cameron, a prominent family values campaigner, that he had had an extramarital affair, and Owens won the seat on preferences, despite a swing against the Labor Party in New South Wales. Owens is a backbencher and has been a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts from December 2004. Although her seat was made notionally Liberal in a redistribution ahead of the 2007 election, she did not only retained her seat, but recorded a healthy swing of seven points. She won a third term in 2010 with only a small swing against her, and narrowly won a fourth term in 2013 even as Labor lost government. Her 2013 victory marked only the second time (her initial win being the first) that the Liberals or their predecessors have been in government without holding Parramatta. Following the resignation of Labor MP Craig Thomson as chair of the Economics Committee, Owens was appointed head of the Committee.

In mathematics, the tent map with parameter Œº is the real-valued function fŒº defined by :f_\\\\mu:=\\\\mu\\\\min\\\\\\\\{x,\\\\,1-x\\\\\\\\}, the name being due to the tent-like shape of the graph of fŒº. For the values of the parameter Œº within 0 and 2, fŒº maps the unit interval [0, 1] into itself, thus defining a discrete-time dynamical system on it (equivalently, a recurrence relation). In particular, iterating a point x0 in [0, 1] gives rise to a sequence x_n : : x_{n+1}=f_\\\\mu(x_n)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mu x_n & \\\\mathrm{for}~~ x_n < \\\\frac{1}{2}   \\\\mu (1-x_n) & \\\\mathrm{for}~~ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\le x_n \\\\end{cases} where Œº is a positive real constant. Choosing for instance the parameter Œº=2, the effect of the function fŒº may be viewed as the result of the operation of folding the unit interval in two, then stretching the resulting interval [0,1/2] to get again the interval [0,1]. Iterating the procedure, any point x0 of the interval assumes new subsequent positions as described above, generating a sequence xn in [0,1].

Depending on the value of Œº, the tent map demonstrates a range of dynamical behaviour ranging from predictable to chaotic. * If Œº is less than 1 the point x = 0 is an attractive fixed point of the system for all initial values of x i.e. the system will converge towards x = 0 from any initial value of x. * If Œº is 1 all values of x less than or equal to 1/2 are fixed points of the system. * If Œº is greater than 1 the system has two fixed points, one at 0, and the other at Œº/(Œº + 1). Both fixed points are unstable i.e. a value of x close to either fixed point will move away from it, rather than towards it. For example, when Œº is 1.5 there is a fixed point at x = 0.6 (because 1.5(1 ‚àí 0.6) = 0.6) but starting at x = 0.61 we get ::0.61 \\\\to 0.585 \\\\to 0.6225 \\\\to 0.56625 \\\\to 0.650625 \\\\ldots * If Œº is between 1 and the square root of 2 the system maps a set of intervals between Œº ‚àí Œº2/2 and Œº/2 to themselves. This set of intervals is the Julia set of the map i.e. it is the smallest invariant sub-set of the real line under this map. If Œº is greater than the square root of 2, these intervals merge, and the Julia set is the whole interval from Œº ‚àí Œº2/2 to Œº/2 (see bifurcation diagram). * If Œº is between 1 and 2 the interval [Œº ‚àí Œº2/2, Œº/2] contains both periodic and non-periodic points, although all of the orbits are unstable (i.e. nearby points move away from the orbits rather than towards them). Orbits with longer lengths appear as Œº increases. For example: ::\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\mu^2+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{\\\\mu^2+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\mu^2+1} \\\\mbox{ appears at } \\\\mu=1 ::\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\mu^3+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{\\\\mu^3+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu^3}{\\\\mu^3+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\mu^3+1} \\\\mbox{ appears at } \\\\mu=\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} ::\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\mu^4+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{\\\\mu^4+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu^3}{\\\\mu^4+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu^4}{\\\\mu^4+1} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\mu^4+1} \\\\mbox{ appears at } \\\\mu \\\\approx 1.8393 * If Œº equals 2 the system maps the interval [0,1] onto itself. There are now periodic points with every orbit length within this interval, as well as non-periodic points. The periodic points are dense in [0,1], so the map has become chaotic. In fact, the dynamics will be non-periodic if and only if x_0 is irrational. This can be seen by noting what the map does when x_n is expressed in binary notation: It shifts the binary point one place to the right; then, if what appears to the left of the binary point is a \\"one\\" it changes all ones to zeroes and vice versa (with the exception of the final bit \\"one\\" in the case of a finite binary expansion); starting from an irrational number, this process goes on forever without repeating itself. The invariant measure for x is the uniform density over the unit interval.Collett, Pierre, and Eckmann, Jean-Pierre, Iterated Maps on the Interval as Dynamical Systems, Boston: Birkhauser, 1980. The autocorrelation function for a sufficiently long sequence {x_n} will show zero autocorrelation at all non-zero lags.Brock, W. A., \\"Distinguishing random and deterministic systems: Abridged version,\\" Journal of Economic Theory 40, October 1986, 168-195. Thus {x_n} cannot be distinguished from white noise using the autocorrelation function. Note that the r=4 case of the logistic map and the \\\\mu =2 case of the tent map are homeomorphic to each other: Denoting the logistically evolving variable as y_n, the homeomorphism is ::x_n = \\\\tfrac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\sin^{-1}(y_{n}^{1/2}). * If Œº is greater than 2 the map's Julia set becomes disconnected, and breaks up into a Cantor set within the interval [0,1]. The Julia set still contains an infinite number of both non-periodic and periodic points (including orbits for any orbit length) but almost every point within [0,1] will now eventually diverge towards infinity. The canonical Cantor set (obtained by successively deleting middle thirds from subsets of the unit line) is the Julia set of the tent map for Œº = 3\\\\. =Numerical errors = Time series of the Tent map for the parameter m=2.0 which shows numerical error: \\"the plot of time series (plot of x variable with respect to number of iterations) stops fluctuating and no values are observed after n=50\\". Parameter m= 2.0, initial point is random. Magnifying the orbit diagram Magnification near the tip shows more details. * A closer look at the orbit diagram shows that there are 4 separated regions at Œº ‚âà 1. For further magnification, 2 reference lines (red) are drawn from the tip to suitable x at certain Œº (e.g., 1.10) as shown. Further magnification shows 8 separated regions. * With distance measured from the corresponding reference lines, further detail appears in the upper and lower part of the map. (total 8 separated regions at some Œº) Asymmetric tent map The asymmetric tent map is essentially a distorted, but still piecewise linear, version of the \\\\mu=2 case of the tent map. It is defined by v_{n+1}=\\\\begin{cases} v_n/a &\\\\mathrm{for}~~ v_n \\\\in [0,a]   (1-v_n)/(1-a) &\\\\mathrm{for}~~ v_n \\\\in [a,1] \\\\end{cases} for parameter a \\\\in [0,1]. The \\\\mu=2 case of the tent map is the present case of a= \\\\tfrac{1}{2}. A sequence {v_n} will have the same autocorrelation function as will data from the first-order autoregressive process w_{n+1} = (2a-1)w_n + u_{n+1} with {u_n} independently and identically distributed. Thus data from an asymmetric tent map cannot be distinguished, using the autocorrelation function, from data generated by a first-order autoregressive process.

He is one of the self-proclaimed originators of \\"lit-hop\\" and was one of the first rappers to sample and reference post-punk, pop punk, and emo bands. He is the founder and CEO of the independent record label Horris Records. He is one of several people who claim to have coined the term \\"iGeneration\\", which he is credited with doing in 2003. Education Lars attended Stevenson School, a high school in Pebble Beach, California. For college and graduate school, he attended Stanford University and Oxford University. Career He has recorded for Truck Records in the UK, Sidecho Records in the United States, Big Mouth Records in Japan, and Shock Records in Australia. He was formerly known as MC Lars Horris but changed his pseudonym to MC Lars in 2004 for purposes of simplicity. In 2006, he released the single \\"Download This Song\\", which entered the Australian Singles Chart at number 29. In 2006, Lars worked with the Canadian independent record label Nettwerk Records to release The Graduate. Following this release, Lars toured extensively throughout the US, then he toured UK and did shows in Japan, and Australia. Not long after the album was released on iTunes, Lars received an e-mail from a 15-year-old fan Elisa Greubel on his web forum saying she identified with \\"Download This Song\\" since her family was one of many being sued by the Recording Industry Association of America. This led to Nettwerk executive Terry McBride and a team of major-label artists managed by Nettwerk to support the Greubels with their case. MC Lars returned to the UK in October 2006. In April 2007, MC Lars and Nettwerk made the component tracks for his single \\"White Kids Aren't Hyphy\\" available for remix under a by-nc-sa Creative Commons license on the Jamglue online mixing site as a contest. In May, MC Lars toured the UK on the third installment of the Good To Go Tour, making friends with Wheatus front man Brendan B. Brown. In July Lars and Brown recorded new songs, two of which would later appear on This Gigantic Robot Kills. In November, Lars returned to the UK on tour with pop-punk band Last Letter Read who performed their own set and then on stage with Lars, debuting Lars' new song \\"Hey There Ophelia\\". MC Lars performing with Australian band Wherewolves at Bang! Nightclub in Melbourne, May 2009. In 2008 and 2009, Lars worked with \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Wheatus, the Rondo Brothers, Nick Rowe and Mike Kennedy of Bloodsimple, Daniel Dart of Time Again, Pierre Bouvier of Simple Plan, MC Bat Commander of the Aquabats, Suburban Legends, Worm Quartet, Gabriel Saporta of Cobra Starship, Brett Anderson of the Donnas, MC Frontalot, Jesse Dangerously, Jaret Reddick of Bowling for Soup, Adil Omar, Linus Dotson of Size 14, Parry Gripp of Nerf Herder, Jonathan Coulton, Aesias Finale, Sebastian Reynolds, Joe Ragosta of Patent Pending and classical musician Walt Ribeiro to complete his album This Gigantic Robot Kills.

Style and culture MC Lars at the Vans Warped Tour 2013. Originally releasing tracks under the name Lars Horris, and then MC Lars Horris, Nielsen eventually dropped Horris (which later became the name of his record label), becoming MC Lars. Lars plays with a laptop and occasionally a punk rock band to back him up, which he refers to as \\"post-punk laptop rap\\". Samples from bands such as Supergrass, Piebald, Brand New, Fugazi, and Iggy Pop play a key role in MC Lars's music. Hearts That Hate, whose song \\"Cry Tonight\\" is sampled in Lars' \\"Signing Emo\\", is a fictional group created by the rapper. The Grammy- nominated Texan band Bowling for Soup performed as Hearts That Hate when MC Lars has supported them on tour. A full version of \\"Cry Tonight\\" is available as a B-side to the UK \\"Signing Emo\\" single. MC Lars has also shown an interest in using lyrics and song titles based on English and American literature. \\"Rapbeth\\" references William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, while \\"Mr. Raven\\" is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Raven\\". \\"Ahab\\" is about the novel Moby Dick and \\"Hey There Ophelia\\" on This Gigantic Robot Kills retells the story of Shakespeare's Hamlet. The term \\"iGeneration\\", coined by Lars in 2003, was used to describe the generation born primarily in the mid-to-late 1980s, was used in his song of the same name and given out for free to Facebook users in August 2006 in conjunction with iTunes. In early 2006, his song \\"Download This Song\\" was featured on the pop-culture CBC Radio show Definitely Not The Opera.  Horris Records  Following 2004's the Laptop EP, Lars continued to grow his independent record label Horris Records. Horris served as an imprint of Nettwerk and Oglio before becoming self-distributed. In 2008, Horris signed a two-record distribution deal with Crappy Records, founded by Jaret Reddick, from the American rock band Bowling For Soup. In 2011, Horris signed Weerd Science. Having his own label allowed Lars to experiment creatively. Lars Attacks! was a return to basics, with less punk elements and more standard hip-hop stylings, funded by Kickstarter, featuring cameos from KRS-One, Sage Francis and Mac Lethal. MC Lars used Kickstarter to fund a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album on vinyl, which also included his \\"Edgar Allan Poe EP\\". On November 6, 2015, Lars released the Zombie Dinosaur LP, his fourth official album. The name Horris Records is derived from a cartoon character Lars created in middle school which also served as the basis for Lars' original stage name, MC Lars Horris, named after a character from Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Live accompaniment On stage, Lars has been joined by Wheatus, Bowling for Soup, Simple Plan, the Matches and Failsafe. While supporting Zebrahead in the UK and Europe in 2010, Ed Udhus, Greg Bergdorf and tour manager Bobby Conner joined Lars on stage. In 2019 MC Lars took to the stage with Newcastle-based unsigned alt rock outfit Ruled By Raptors as his backing band in the UK as part of his 10-year anniversary celebrations for This Gigantic Robot Kills. On the tour, MC Lars mentioned this was the first time that he had performed with a band without any form of backing track, instead relying on the band to recreate everything instrumentally or with samples and triggers.

Overview Former logo It was originally launched in the UK in March 1992 as TLC, a British version of the US channel of the same name. It was initially broadcast as a daytime channel from Intelsat, mostly aimed at cable systems where it would broadcast on the Discovery Channel's frequency. When the Discovery Channel launched on Astra in July 1993, it didn't initially carry TLC in the daytime. From 1994, it shared a transponder on the Astra 1C satellite with the Discovery Channel, which started its broadcasts at 4pm (GMT). It was later rebranded as Discovery Home & Leisure in April 1997. Full day broadcasting started with the launch of Sky Digital in 1998. In May 2001, a timeshift channel called Discovery Home & Leisure +1 was launched. From 1997 to 2002, the logo was a blue oblong containing a window, however this was changed to a red background featuring a stylised 'H&L;', staying like this until 2005. The channel was relaunched as Discovery Real Time on 7 May 2005 in the UK market. The channel aimed at complementing the female-skewed Discovery Home & Health (which itself replaced Discovery Health). A sister channel called Discovery Real Time Extra was launched on 22 August 2005. On 20 March 2009, it was replaced with Discovery Shed. Discovery Real Time is also available in some other regions, including France and Italy. The channel used to be available in Asia, but since October 2008, it has become the Asian version of Discovery Turbo. The channel closed along with Discovery Travel & Living at 6am on 30 April 2013, to be replaced by TLC and Investigation Discovery +1. The last program on Discovery Real Time was, fittingly, The Joy of Painting, one of Real Time's signature programs.

Early life He was born in a royal family of a business man in Bani Yafrah among the Berber Ghomara tribe, near Ceuta in the north of Morocco, also known as the Rif region, in 1196.Elmer H. Douglas (ed.), Muhammad ibn Abi al-Qasim Al-Sabbagh, The Mystical Teachings of Al-ShƒÅdhilƒ´: Including His Life, Prayers, Suny Press, 1993, p. 3 He was a Maliki who wandered far afield in search of knowledge. Immensely learned, even as a young man, he was famous for his ability to engage in legal argumentation with the religions scholars of his day. As a young man, Abul Hasan was hesitating between living the life of an ascetic in the wilderness in order to give himself up totally to worship and invocation, or to return to the towns and settlements to be in the company of the scholars and the righteous. He studied in Fes and moved to Alexandria in 1244.Caesar E. Farah, Islam: beliefs and observances, p. 231 In Iraq he met the Sufi master al-Wasiti, who advised him that he could find his Spiritual Master (Sheikh) in the country Abul Hasan had travelled from: Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, the great Moroccan spiritual master. Under his guidance, Abul Hasan attained enlightenment and proceeded to spread his knowledge across North Africa, especially in Tunisia and Egypt, where he is buried. He founded his first zawiya in Tunis in 1227. He died in 1258 in Humaithra, Egypt, while he was on his way to the pilgrimage in Mecca. Humaithara is between Marsa Alam and Aswan in Egypt and his shrine there is highly venerated. When he heard of a saintly man teaching Islamic sciences in the Al-Qarawiyyin university of Fez he hastened to meet him and his life changed. This man was the Sufi and scholar Mohammed ibn Harazem (d. 633/1218), grandson of Abul Hassan Ali ibn Harzihim (d. 559/1144) and student of Abu Salih Mohammed Majiri (d. 631/1216), who had been instrumental in the orientation of Abul Hassan to seek the spiritual Pole of the time (Qutb az-Zaman). Finding his sheikh It was in a hermitage on top of Jabal al-'Alam, near T√©touan, that he met the sheikh who he was searching for and who was to have the greatest influence on his life, Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish (d. 625/1228), known as \\"the Pole of the West\\", just as Abd al-Qadir Gilani (d. 561/1166) was called \\"the Pole of the East\\". While he was living with Sheikh Ibn Mashish, on the holy mountain, many wonderful signs from Allah came to Abu'l Hasan, through this holy guide. One such sign was that on the night of his arrival on the mountain he was sleeping at the entrance of the cave where his master lived. He dreamt that he was asking the Sheikh to grant him certain wishes, one of them being that Allah would incline the hearts of His creatures in favour towards him. Then he wished to ask his master if it was necessary for him to live in solitude, or in the desert, in order for him to be in the right station (maqaam) to perform his religious tasks, or whether he should return to the towns and inhabited places to seek out the company of scholars and virtuous people. While he was turning these things in his heart he heard the Sheikh praying fervently and calling out: The next morning, when he greeted his teacher to be, he asked him of his state (kayf al-hal), to which Ibn Mashish responded, \\"I complain unto God about the coolness of contentment and submission (bard al-rida wa al-taslim) just as you complain unto Him about the heat of self-direction and choice (harr al-tadbir wa al-ikhtiyar).\\" When he saw the astonishment on his student's face at hearing his words, he added, \\"Because I fear that the sweetness of such an existence would make me neglectful of my duty towards Allah.\\" Then Abu'l Hasan said, \\"This is the Pole of Islam. This is the Sea which overflows.\\" He knew then that his master had taken hold of his whole heart, and he was thereby completely illumined. Four fundamental themes ran through Abd as-Salam teaching of to Abu'l Hasan, as perceived from his famous Hizb, called as-Salat al-Mashishiya: # the Oneness of Existence (wahdat al-wujud) which he said could be realised only through asceticism, # fear of God and His judgements (khawfu billah), # the belief that God is everywhere and that it is necessary to see His Face in everything that He has created, # that only through the drowning in the Ocean of the Unity (awnu fi bahri al-wahadati) can the seeker cast off and leave behind his own existence and attributes to be merged and absorbed into Allah and His Attributes. Before his departure from Jabal al- Alam, Abd as-Salam foretold his student of his eventual move to Ifriqiya where he will become known by the name of Shadhili and the eminent spiritual station he will eventually inherit from Abd as-Salam himself. Abu'l Hasan relates that in a dream, he saw his master standing near the Divine Throne. When he told him of this dream in the morning, Abd as-Salam replied, \\"O Ali, it was not me you saw, it was the station you will inherit from me.\\" The parting words of advice and admonition that Abd as-Salam gave his disciple before he departed for Tunis emphasised the transformation of consciousness to inward and outward God-centeredness, contentment with God in all states, and the inner withdrawal from creation in prosperity and adversity. These seminal teachings of Abd as- Salam would, through Abu'l Hasan, become the fundamental precepts of the Shadhili Tariqa. Travels The Holy Dargah of Imam Shadhili, Humaithara, Egypt =Tunis= Remaining with his master for a while, Abu'l Hasan then departed for Shadhila, in Tunisia, on orders from his teacher; and from there he received the name of al-Shadhili. He entered a new retreat in a cave on top of Jabal Zaghwan close to Shadhila accompanied by his first companion Abu Yahya Abdellah ibn Samala al-Habibi. After intense spiritual exercises in the Jabal Zaghwan region, he was ordered in a vision to teach Sufism. Accordingly, he set up his first institution (zawiyah) in Tunis in the year 625/1228, just when the new governor, Abu Zakariyya', also arrived. During his early years in Tunis, Abu'l Hasan first taught forty students who were known as the forty friends (al-awliya al-arba'un). His new tariqah was a stunning success, drawing masses of people from all walks of life, including the sultan's family. On one of his trips to the East, an Ayyubid sultan conferred on him and his descendants, by way of a religious endowment, one of the enormous towers that arose from the walls formerly encompassing the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Abu'l Hasan remained in Tunis for a number of years until one day God Most High brought him a young man who was to become his successor and the inheritor of his station and his holy line, Abul Abbas al-Mursi (d. 686/1271), from Murcia in Spain. =Egypt= In the year 642/1244, the sheikh, once again had a vision. Abu'l Hasan said: Thus he left Tunisia accompanied by Al-Mursi Abu'l-'Abbas, his brother Abdullah, his servant Abu al-'Azayim as well as other Sufi sheikhs and many of his own disciples, and moved to Alexandria, where he established both his residence and the institution (zawiyah) of his order in the tower the sultan had given him. Alexandria was, during this time, a distinguished city and a place of learning various major sciences. He lived with his family on the top floor; another floor was converted into a tremendous mosque where he gave public instruction; and another floor was converted into a great zawiyah for his disciples, with cells for meditational retreat. In Egypt, likewise, his order was greatly successful, drawing into its ranks many court officials, great religious scholars like Izz al-Din ibn 'Abd al-Salam (d. 660/1262) or the Shafi 'i traditionist al-Mundhiri (d. 656/1258), a host of Sufi figures, and individuals from different levels of society. In the year 646/1248, he lost His vision, and it was in that state that he participated in the Battle of Al Mansurah in Egypt, which stopped the Seventh Crusade headed by Saint Louis of France. Death Shortly before Sheikh Abu'l Hasan started on his last pilgrimage to Mecca, the city of Baghdad fell to the conquering Mongols, thus ending the long reign of the Abbasids there and ushering in a new epoch in the history of Islam. The sheikh was accompanied by a mass of his disciples; but he fell ill in the eastern desert of Egypt, in a place called Humaithara (now: Sheikh Shazly), and there he died in the year 656/1258. Successors Shortly before he died, in 656/1258, Sheikh Abu'l Hasan designated Abu'l Abbas al-Mursi as his successor in the order. After Sheikh Abu'l Hasan's death, Abu'l Abbas al-Mursi moved into the great tower that the founder of the Shadhiliyyah had used as residence, mosque, and zawiyah, and remained there until his death ( 686/1288) some thirty years later, seldom moving out to travel in Egypt. Ideas When asked who his spiritual master was, he used to reply, \\"I used to be the close follower of Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, but still I am drinking the water of wisdom from five ponds Jibril, Mikhail, Israfil, Izra'il, Rooh.\\" Shaykh Abul- Abbas al-Mursi (d. 1288), who succeeded Shaykh ash-Shadhili as the spiritual master of the Order, was asked about the knowledge of his spiritual master and replied, \\"He gave me forty sciences. He was an ocean without a shore.\\" He taught his close followers to lead a life of contemplation and remembrance of Allah while performing the normal everyday activities of the world. He disliked initiating any would-be follower unless that person already had a profession. His admonition to his close followers was to apply the teachings of Islam in their own lives in the world and to transform their existence. Shadhili wrote several devotional recitations, prayers and letters, some of which remain today.Ibrahim M.

The objective of groups such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is not just to help their members stop abusing drugs and alcohol. It is acknowledged in these programs that addiction is more systemic than a \\"bad habit\\" and is fundamentally caused by self-centeredness. Long term membership in Alcoholics Anonymous has been found to reform pathological narcissism, and those who are sober but retain characteristics associated with addiction are known in AA as dry drunks. The term is used by Alcoholics Anonymous in relation to feelings of anger, depression and resentment. A dry drunk can be described as a person who refrains from alcohol or drugs, but still has all the unresolved emotional and psychological issues which might have fueled the addiction to begin with. These unresolved issues continue to have a hold on their psyche and hence, while they do not seek intoxication, they exhibit many of the other behavioural traits associated with addiction. In most cases, alcohol dependency is a substantial factor in the lives of the alcoholics and accepting sobriety comes with its own challenges and understanding of their personality. Despite leaving alcohol and de-addicting themselves, most of their personalities are an embodiment of their drunkard selves. The dry drunk is portrayed with feelings of profound depression and frustration and with the indecisive feeling of wanting a drink that they have given up. Several alcoholics drink for about 10-20 years before maintaining sobriety and get used to the personality and character traits that are embodied by their drunkard selves. During this phase of dry drunk, the addicts face restlessness, frustration, anger, impatience and craving. The symptoms of dry drunkenness are irregular and become less intense as the period of sobriety increases. Most of the symptoms of dry drunkenness can be noticed in the initial phase of sobriety.

Hitori is NP completeGames, Puzzles, and Computation 2009, by Robert A. Hearn, Erik D. Demaine Rules The same Hitori puzzle, now solved Hitori is played with a grid of squares or cells, with each cell initially containing a number. The game is played by eliminating squares/numbers and this is done by blacking them out. The objective is to transform the grid to a state wherein all three following rules are true: *no row or column can have more than one occurrence of any given number *black cells cannot be adjacent, although they can be diagonal to one another. *the remaining numbered cells must be all connected to each other, horizontally or vertically. Solving techniques *Once it is determined that a cell cannot be black, some players find it useful to circle the number, as it makes the puzzle easier to read as the solution progresses. Below we assume that this convention is followed. *When it is determined that a cell must be black, all orthogonally adjacent cells cannot be black and so can be circled. *If a cell has been circled to show that it cannot be black, any cells containing the same number in that row and column must be black. *If blacking out a cell would cause a connected non- black area to become separated into several unconnected components, the cell cannot be black and so can be circled. *In a sequence of three identical, adjacent numbers, the centre number cannot be black and the cells on either side must be black. The reason is that if one of the end numbers remains non- black this would result in either two adjacent black cells or two cells with the same number in the same row or column, neither of which are allowed. (This is a special case of the next item.) *In case of two identical, adjacent numbers, if another cell occurs in the same row or column containing the same number, the latter cell must be black. Otherwise, if it remains non-black, this would result in either two cells with the same number in the same row or column, or two adjacent black cells, neither of which are allowed. *Any number that has two identical numbers on opposite sides of itself cannot be black, because one of the two identical numbers must be black, and it cannot be adjacent to another black cell. *When two pairs of identical numbers are in a two by two square on the grid, two of them must be black along a diagonal. There are only two possible combinations, and it is sometimes possible to decide which is correct by determining if one variation will cut non-black squares off from the remainder of the grid. *When two pairs of identical numbers form a square in the corner of a grid, the corner square and the one diagonally opposite must be black. The alternative would leave the corner square isolated from the other non-black numbers.

His reign was famous for one important event: the reforms consisting of \\"Wearing the Hu (styled) Attire and Shooting from Horseback (in battle)\\" (Simplified Chinese: ËÉ°ÊúçÈ™ëÂ∞Ñ, Traditional Chinese: ËÉ°ÊúçÈ®éÂ∞Ñ) He was credited for the implementation of protective outfit during military events and proceedings. Probably the son of Zhao Suhou (Marquess Su of Zhao, Simplified Chinese: ËµµËÇÉ‰æØ), King Wuling of Zhao ascended to the throne at 325 BCE, about halfway into the Warring States Period. His reign coincided with the appearance of several other notable figures in the Warring States. He was also the first ruler of Zhao to style himself \\"king\\" (Áéã), but later reversed the decision. He would later receive the title as part of his posthumous name. Rule and reforms During the early years of his reign, the Kingdom of Zhao was constantly harassed by the Donghu, the Linhu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: ÊûóËÉ°), the Loufan (Simplified Chinese: Ê•ºÁÉ¶) and the Beidi, all nomadic animal husbandry tribes. This might have been the inspiration for his later reforms. On another level, Wuling himself had been humbled after a great defeat by Qin. Previously, during 325-323 BC, he, along with the rulers of Han, Wei, Yan and Zhongshan, had declared himself king. However, in 318 BC, Zhao suffered a great defeat in the hands of Qin, causing Wuling to muse that since he did not have the power of a king, he should not use the title. In 307 BCE, Wuling started his reforms. Mostly military, they concentrated on making the military more suited to fighting battles. Up to that time, Zhao commanders riding on horseback still wore robes and normal court attire. Wuling ordered all commanders, including the whole court and military, to adopt the Hu style of dress: pants, belt, boots, fur caps and fur clothes. He created a cavalry division in the army and trained them not only in the ways of a cavalry charge, but also in horse archery. While many reformists and officials supported the reforms, seeing it as a way to greatness and power, conservative members of the royal family such as Zhao Wuling's uncle Lord Cheng (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: ÂÖ¨Â≠êÊàê) disliked it, claiming that there should not be any \\"Copying of barbaric clothing and changing of old rules\\" (Simplified Chinese: ‰∏çËØ• \\"Ë¢≠ËøúÊñπ‰πãÊúç, ÂèòÂè§‰πãÊïô\\"). Lord Cheng even went so far as to be absent from court. Wuling did much to check the opposition. He said, \\"There is not only one way to rule the world, nor is there any need to copy the old to benefit the country\\" (Simplified Chinese: \\"ÁêÜ‰∏ñ‰∏çÂøÖ‰∏ÄÈÅì, ‰æøÂõΩ‰∏çÂøÖÊ≥ïÂè§\\") and \\"Those who use the old to define the new do not achieve change\\" (Simplified Chinese: \\"‰ª•Âè§Âà∂‰ªäËÄÖ, ‰∏çËææ‰∫é‰∫ã‰πãÂèò\\"). He wore the \\"barbaric\\" clothes on court and persuaded others to do the same. He even visited Lord Cheng and gave him a suit of the Hu people's clothing. Finally, Lord Cheng relented, and the controversy stopped. Wuling's reforms greatly improved the fighting capability of the Zhao military. The same year, the Zhao attacked the Hu people's state of Zhongshan and took several cities. In 306 BCE the Zhao military launched expeditions into Wuhu territories in the north. The northern expedition was highly successful: the kings of the Loufan and Linhu surrendered and their territories became administered by a governor of Dai. In the next year, parts of Zhongshan were annexed.Yap, Joseph P. 'Wars with the Xiongnu: A Translation of the Zizhi Tongjian',2009, page 13 In 304 BCE the upper reaches of the Yellow River were invaded and taken from the Hu tribes like the Hezong (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: Ê≤≥ÂÆóÊ∞è) and the Xiu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: ‰ºë). In the conquered areas King Wuling created two prefectures in 302 BCE - Yunzhong (Simplified Chinese: ‰∫ë‰∏≠) and Jiuyuan. In a little over five years Zhao Wuling had expanded his country to the border with the Yan, the upper reaches of the Yellow River and into the north, and had forced two tribal leaders, the Loufan and Linhu kings, to surrender. King Wuling took control of their armies and added them to his military, creating extra divisions made up entirely of indigenous and hardy nomadic warriors. Abdication and death In 299 BCE, Zhao Wuling, perhaps tired out from all he had done and wishing to become more involved with military instead of political affairs, abdicated and gave the throne of Zhao to his younger son, Zhao He (Simplified Chinese: Ëµµ‰Ωï) who was to become King Huiwen of Zhao (Simplified Chinese: ËµµÊÉ†ÊñáÁéã). He called himself the \\"Lord Father\\" (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: ‰∏ªÁà∂), using his new title to visit neighbouring countries, especially the Qin, which he visited secretly. He lived long enough to see the annexation of the Zhongshan by the Zhao in 296 BCE. In 295 BCE, Wuling's older son Zhao Zhang (Simplified Chinese: ËµµÁ´†) rebelled against King Huiwen and lost. He escaped to the palace in Shaqiu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: Ê≤ô‰∏ò), where Zhao Wuling took pity on him and kept him in his palace. Prime Minister Lord Anping (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: ÂÆâÂπ≥Âêõ), who was Lord Cheng, the uncle of Wuling, and his subordinate Lord Fengyang (Simplified Chinese: Â•âÈò≥Âêõ), also known as Li Yu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: ÊùéÂÖå) laid siege to the palace, allowing no food or water to be provided to the inhabitants inside. In desperation, King Wuling ordered Zhang to be killed, but still the besiegers did not retreat. Thus, after 100 days, King Wuling starved to death. When the siege was finally lifted, King Wuling's body was already rotting and full of worms, a pitiful ending for such a king.

Following the merger of the two courts a Lord Ordinary, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, is designated as the Lord Ordinary in Exchequer cases. History The date of establishment of an Exchequer Court is unknown because of the loss of ancient records. Originally, Crown revenues were managed by overseers who came to be known as the Lords Auditors of the Checker, later King's Compositors, then Lords of Exchequer. There is evidence that the Lords Auditors of Exchequer were sitting as a court by 1500, but under the jurisdiction of the King's Council. Charles I of Scotland appointed Lords Commissioners of Exchequer whose authority was both administrative and judicial, and it was during the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell that they became known as the Court of Exchequer. Article 16 of the Act of Union 1707 provided: :\\"And that there be a Court of Exchequer in Scotland after the Union, for deciding Questions concerning the Revenues of Customs and Excises there, having the same power and authority in such cases, as the Court of Exchequer has in England And that the said Court of Exchequer in Scotland have power of passing Signatures, Gifts Tutories, and in other things as the Court of Exchequer in Scotland hath; And that the Court of Exchequer that now is in Scotland do remain, until a New Court of Exchequer be settled by the Parliament of Great Britain in Scotland after the Union;\\"Section XIX, \\"And that there be a Court of Exchequer in Scotland after the Union, for deciding Questions concerning the Revenues of Customs and Excises there, having the same power and authority in such cases, as the Court of Exchequer has in England\\": The new Court of Exchequer was established by the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1707. It provided that the judges of the Court were to be the Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain and such other persons who might be appointed by royal commission, and who were known as the Chief Baron of Exchequer and Barons of Exchequer. The number of Barons of Exchequer was limited to five. The Court's jurisdiction related to customs and excise and matters of revenue, stamp duty and probate.History of the Court: It appears to have implemented English law in its determinations. In 1856 the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court was transferred to the Court of Session by the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1856, which became the Court of Exchequer in Scotland. One of the Lords Ordinary in the Outer House of the Court of Session is to be designated as Lord Ordinary in Exchequer Causes; this was restated by the Court of Session Act 1988. The 1856 Act stated: The Lord Ordinary in Exchequer Cases is designated by order of the Lord President of the Court of Session under powers granted by Schedule 4 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990, which amended previous enactments requiring the appointment to be made by Act of Sederunt.  Remit and jurisdiction  The Court's jurisdiction related to customs and excise and matters of revenue, stamp duty and probate. In modern times the business of the court consists in the main of appeals on law from the determination of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax on issues of liability to tax. The procedure for exchequer cases is determined by Chapters 41 and 48 of the Rules of the Court of Session.

Born in England, Armstrong became a naturalised Finn in the early 1990s, and enjoyed a long and successful coaching career in Finland with Rovaniemen Palloseura, TP- Sein√§joki, FC Haka and most recently HJK Helsinki. Armstrong is one of the most successful football managers in the Finnish league, having won five Veikkausliiga championships, two Finnish Cups, and two Manager of the Year awards.  Career  Armstrong was born in Corbridge, Northumberland. He began his football career as an apprentice with Sunderland, making his debut in the Second Division on 4 October 1977 as a substitute in a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Cardiff City. He played regularly at the end of the 1977‚Äì78 season, and during the following season spent time on loan to Newport County and Scunthorpe United before being released. He joined Newcastle United, but was promptly loaned out to the Finnish club Oulun Palloseura (OPS). He played with OPS for two years, before moving to Koparit in Kuopio. Subsequently, he played in nine different clubs around Finland, appearing in 179 league matches, scoring 60 goals, and winning three championships (with OPS in 1979 and 1980 and with Kuusysi in 1984). In 1993, at the age of 35, he retired from playing professional football and started out as the manager of his then club Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS). For the 1995 season, he moved to Sein√§joki and took the local club, TP-Sein√§joki into the Veikkausliiga. In 1997, he was offered a post at FC Haka, which he accepted, getting the club promoted from the second tier and winning three league championships in a row with the Valkeakoski team. He received the Manager of the Year award in 2000, after Haka's second subsequent title. In late 2001, he was signed by HJK, propelling the team to a league championship in 2002 and a league and cup double in 2003. In 2004, however, the club finished in mid-table. In 2006 Armstrong received his second Manager of the Year award and led HJK to second place in the league. He was sacked in September 2007. He also works for Finnish television as a football pundit and studio commentator for Canal+ Scandinavia. Armstrong was part of Finland national football team's ex-manager Stuart Baxter's staff, working as scout. After working as sporting director of SJK for two years, on 24 October 2014 Armstrong was appointed as the new manager of Ilves Tampere for the upcoming season. On 4 October 2015, Armstrong missed Ilves' match against SJK to present MTV3's Premier League coverage. Two days later, on 7 October 2015, Armstrong was sacked by Ilves.

It is the administrative center of Sarata Raion (district), and is part of the Bessarabian historic district of Budjak. Population: History In 2001 the estimated population was around 5,200. The town dates to 1822. Much of it is filled with crop fields and abandoned military bases. Many people here own their own farm animals although you would not call them farmers. Much of the community is modernized and still growing. The community holds many celebrations and parades, especially during the spring/summer time. Being only two hours away from the city, it is a convenient way to spend your summer relaxing. Its name means \\"salty\\" in Romanian and is derived from the Sarata River, which flows through the town. A literal interpretation of SƒÉrata in Romanian is the salted [female] one. In spring of 1822 a group of Germans traveled to these lands. In the group of settlers were 63 families and 9 single people without family; they were led by Pastor Ignaz Lindl. They set up a colony around a well with an underground spring. They named the camp Sarata - just like the river that ran through the lands. Around the well the group built small houses, tents, and barns. Being a source of life, the well was included into the coat of arms of Sarata at the time.

It is ritually burned as incense, and its seeds are a narcotic for Centauri when dropped in alcohol. The G'Quan Eth plant is \\"difficult to grow, expensive to transport, very expensive to own.\\" Whether it affects other species in this way when in alcohol is not clear, but we know that Narn don't seem to use it as a recreational drug (Londo chides G'Kar for Narns \\"It's a shame you Narns waste them, burning them as incense\\") and that it is illegal to possess on B5 except in religious contexts.

You also temporarily grow fins and flippers. *Gurdyroot: resembles a green onion. Basis for a foul-tasting purple infusion brewed by the Lovegoods in order to fend off Gulping Plimpies. Considered not very original by Charles Elliott, depending on a funny name for effect. *Mandrakes: tubers that look like babies when young. Their screams can kill when fully grown. A potion made from mature mandrakes can restore victims who have been petrified. A different kind of mandrake is a real plant. Whilst the mandrake as it appears in the books and films is fictional, Rowling's description does reflect genuinely held beliefs about the mandrake, in particular, the danger surrounding its screams. This led to the practice of using dogs to collect the mandrake, and the blocking of ears during collecting. *The whomping willow: a tree which has club-like branches which can move. The whomping Willow is very hostile in the Chamber of Secrets book; Harry Potter and Ron Weasly crash into it with a car, and are lucky to escape alive. There is a secret passage that leads into the Shrieking Shack, a haunted house, underneath the whomping Willow's roots. = In Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere Series = ;On the planet Roshar (The Stormlight Archive) * Firemoss: A red-brown moss that, when activated by rubbing between the thumb and forefinger, releases wisps of smoke that create feelings of euphoria when inhaled and is used as a recreational drug. Firemoss is highly addictive, limiting its medicinal use, though it is sometimes used to reduce cranial swelling and offer pain relief. * Knobweed: Like most of the plants found on Rohsar, knobweed has adapted to survive the planet‚Äôs harsh storms. The reed- like stalk anchors itself directly to stone and the frond found at the top of the stalk has the ability to contract and retreat into the stalk during storms for protection. Knobweed reproduces by releasing fluffy pappuses that carry seeds into the air. The milky white sap found inside knobweed stems is a natural and highly valuable antiseptic used in the field and by established apothecaries. * Prickletac: Prickletac plants are actually colonies of much smaller living buds. As each generation of buds dies it converts to a hard, stony material which the next generation builds upon. Prickletac‚Äôs reproductive system is based on this oddity ‚Äì when a ‚Äòlimb‚Äô grows too large it breaks off and falls to the ground, scattering living buds. Also known as Twisted Spine. * Rockbuds: Rockbud is both a general term for several shelled plants on Roshar, including Lavis Polyps, Vinebuds, and Prickletac Shrubs, and the proper name for a specific plant. The true Rockbud plant is a shelled plant containing lengthy tendrils that reach out to lap up water (and occasionally animal blood). The size of fully grown rockbuds depends largely on climate. In colder climates they grow no larger than a human fist, while rockbuds in warm climates can grow to the size of a barrel. Rockbuds are harvested for consumption, limited medicinal uses, and paper making. * Shalebark: A class of stony, fanlike plants often used for decoration and landscaping. ;On the planet Nalthis (Warbreaker) * Tears of Edgli: Vibrantly colored flowers that grow only in the temperate T‚ÄôTelir climate. Highly valuable both economically and magically. ;On the planet First of the Sun (Sixth of the Dusk); * Unnamed Telepathic Trees: Many flora and fauna on this planet communicate with a form of natural telepathy. Certain unnamed plants living on the islands that make up the Pantheon send false thoughts of wounded or frightened animals to attract predators, which often fight and leave victims dead near enough to the tree to provide nutrition. These plants are not directly carnivorous. ;On the planet Taldain (White Sand Series) * Dorim vines: Dorim vines live under the sand that covers most of Taldain‚Äôs Dayside continent, reaching down to the water table where they fill themselves with water as a defensive mechanism against predators ‚Äì the hard shells of many of the continents animals is dissolved by contact with water. Pouring water onto sand draws nearby vines out of the ground. =In Dungeons & Dragons= The role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons has a number of imaginary, according to Charles Elliott \\"not-very-ingenious\\", plant species, as well as \\"a taxonomy of fungal horrors\\", which Ben Woodard considers eerie not only for their poisonous nature, but because many have the ability to move. *Basidirond: a giant multi-stemmed fungus creature *Hangman tree: a tree that will attempt to strangle anyone who ventures under it *Kelpie: a shape-shifting mass of animate seaweed that can imitate a woman or other creatures, and drowns its victims *Myconid: a \\"fungus man\\" *Oaken defender: an enormous disk-shaped plant that lives in dryad groves and assists in their defense *Obliviax: \\"memory moss\\", a black moss that steals memories from intelligent creatures *Phantom fungus: a dangerous subterranean plant that grapples victims with tentacles *Shambling mound: an atrocious plant-like creature, also called a shambler *Shrieker: ambulatory fungus that emits piercing shrieks *Tendriculos: an enormous, savage, sentient plant resembling a huge, tangled shrubbery *Treant: sentient trees with human characteristics that typically protect forests from antagonists *Vegepygmy: a \\"mold man\\", a former human transformed by russet mold *Wood woad: a creature resembling big, burly, bestial men made entirely of wood and bark bearing, but without foliage *Yellow musk creeper: a creeping plant that drains the intelligence of its victims, killing them or turning them into \\"yellow musk zombies\\" under the plant's control =In Monty Python's Flying Circus= The following plants appear in the David Attenborough sketch of the last Monty Python episode. * Angolan sauntering tree (Amazellus robin ray). * Gambian sidling bush. * Puking Tree of Mozambique. * The Turkish little rude plant: A remarkably smutty piece of flora used by the Turks. * Walking tree of Dahomey (Quercus nicholas parsonus): the legendary walking tree that can achieve speeds of up to 50 miles an hour, especially when it is in a hurry. There is movie footage from the late 1940s in which a walking tree actually sprints after a cheetah. Very funny, although the cheetah was subsequently quite rooted. =In the 2009 film Avatar= Plants in Pandora have evolved according to the characteristics of their environment, which has an atmosphere that is thicker than on Earth, with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, xenon and hydrogen sulfide. Gravity is weaker in Pandora, thereby giving rise to gigantism. There is a strong magnetic field, causing plants to develop 'magnetotropism'. A particularly intriguing quality of flora and fauna in Pandora is their ability to communicate with each other. This is explained in the movie as a phenomenon called 'signal transduction', pertaining to how plants perceive a signal and respond to it. =In video games= Video games frequently feature fictional plants as items that can be collected by the player, or occasionally appear as non-player characters. * The Monster Hunter series has multiple fictional flowers and plants that can be gathered by the player character, including nulberries, might seeds, flowferns, and dragonstrike nuts. *Sunflower from the Plants vs Zombies series it is a flower which is used to collect sunlight for you, a point which is extremely useful to place other defensive plants. * The Legend of Zelda series, plants play a significant role. In many games, bomb flowers allow the player character to explode rocks and obstacles. In Breath of the Wild in particular, the game is full of flowers and herbs that convey different abilities to Link, including the Silent Princess, Princess Zelda's favourite flower. The series also contains the Great Deku Tree, a guardian tree that watches over the forest in multiple games in the franchise. *Broc Flower: a plant in Fallout: New Vegas used as a medical remedy. *Plantera: a flower from the game Terraria which is used to be a two phase bossfight, normal and enraged, in 100% health it is on its normal form but when the player decreases its life to 50% it enters what is called enraged mode, bursting a mouth with many sharp teeth, becoming more aggressive and difficult. *Candypop Bud: a flower found in the video games Pikmin and Pikmin 2. *Chuck the Plant: a plant found in several of LucasArts' games. * Elowan: a race of plant-like creatures in Starflight computer game, . *Flowey: A sentient golden flower who is one of the main antagonists from the game Undertale. Flowey has no soul and in the neutral route Flowey consumes 6 human souls to become Photoshop Flowey, the final boss of that route. *Genesis Trees: trees located in the world of Legaia from the video game Legend of Legaia. They have the power to keep a large area free of the Mist. * Lunar Tears, from Nier and Nier: Automata, by PlatinumGames. *Nirnroot: Is a very rare plant with strong alchemical properties from The Elder Scrolls series of video games. Appearing as a blueish green plant that emits a constant hum. *Piranha Plants: plants with mouths from the Mario series of video games, often depicted as sentient. It is also a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. *Fire Flower another famous flower from Mario series of videogames, used to enable Mario to shoot fire balls. *Supox utricularia: a race of kind, sentient plant creatures from Star Control computer game series. *Xander Root: a plant in Fallout: New Vegas used as a medical remedy. *Sylvari: a race of sapient plant people in the MMO Guild Wars 2, available as a playable race. =In DC Comics= The Black Mercy is an extraterrestrial hallucinogenic plant used a weapon by the supervillain Mongul. Mongul first uses it in \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", a story by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons that was first published in Superman Annual #11 (1985) and later adapted into the Justice League Unlimited episode of the same name and for one episode of \\"Supergirl\\" called \\"For the Girl Who Has Everything\\", where in that episode the plant was sent by Kryptonian Non (comics). Described in the original story by Mongul as \\"something between a plant and an intelligent fungus\\", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of symbiosis, and feeds from the victim's \\"bio-aura\\". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of \\"shrugging off\\" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling too do so unaided.Moore, Alan (w), Gibbons, Dave (a). \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", Superman Annual #11 (1985). DC Comics. The Black Mercy is typically depicted as consisting of dark green, thorned vines that attach themselves to a humanoid victim's upper torso, with a set of pink flowers, each with a long, red, tentacle-like stigma, growing in the center of the victim's chest. When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can be pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely. Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though Oliver Queen and Hal Jordan are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline when they are both trapped by the same plant, as this meant that the two were sharing an illusion and Hal's strength of will caused Oliver to experience what Hal believed was his friend's greatest desire rather than Oliver making the choice himself.Johns, Geoff (w), Pacheco, Carlos (p), Merino, Jesus (i). \\"A Perfect Life: Chapters 1-2\\", Green Lantern (Vol. 4) #7-8 (February‚ÄìMarch 2006). DC Comics. In the video game, Injustice 2 Supergirl mentions Black Mercy in pre-battle dialogue with Scarecrow. She states dealing with him is no different than dealing with Black Mercy, causing Scarecrow to ask her what is Black Mercy out of curiosity, causing Supergirl to describe it as an evil space plant. Characters who have experienced the Black Mercy include: *Superman sees himself on a still-intact Krypton with his biological parents, married to a retired actress named Lyla, and a son named Van. *Batman envisions a life in which his parents were not murdered during his childhood, and he is married to Kathy Kane. *Mongul envisions a life in which he successfully kills Superman, before setting out across the universe, killing all of his enemies, entire populations kneeling before him amid his destruction of countless galaxies.Jurgens, Dan (w), Zircher, Patrick (a). \\"Revenge, Part I\\". Action Comics #979 (Early June 2017). DC Comics. *Green Arrow envisions a life in which he is married to Sandra \\"Moonday\\" Hawke, and in addition to their older son Connor, they have a younger son, and a newborn third. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Green Arrow was caught along with Hal Jordan, with the result that he saw what Hal believed would be his perfect life. *Hal Jordan envisions a life in which his parents and his siblings are present in his life, and Sinestro is a friend who fights by his side as a member of the Green Lantern Corps. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Jordan was caught in the same illusion as Oliver Queen, which resulted in Jordan creating what he believed would be Queen's perfect life rather than Queen experiencing his own idea of a perfect life, allowing Queen to see through its simulation and thus awaken from it. In mythology * Aglaophotis: A type of Peony said to be magical *Austras koks: a tree which grows from the start of the Sun's daily journey across the sky in Latvian mythology * Barnacle tree: mythical tree believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese. The story may have started from goose barnacles growing on driftwood. *Fern flower: a magic plant in Baltic mythology thought to only bloom one night, sought by lovers *Lotus tree: a plant in Greek mythology bearing a fruit that caused a pleasant drowsiness. It may have been real (a type of jujube (perhaps Ziziphus lotus) or the date palm). *Moly: a magic herb in Greek mythology with a black root and white blossoms *Raskovnik: a magic plant in Serbian mythology which can open any lock *Vegetable Lamb of Tartary: a mythical plant supposed by medieval thinkers to explain the existence of cotton *Yggdrasil: the World tree of Norse mythology Hoaxes *Man-eating tree or Madagascar tree: a fictitious tree in the forests of Madagascar. There are stories of similar trees in the jungles of Mindanao Island in the Philippines. The tree is said to have a gray trunk and animated vine-like stems used to capture and kill humans and other large animals.

It is bounded roughly by Palmetto Street, McCallie Avenue, East 4th Street, and O'Neal Street, just east of the campus of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. History Houses on Vine Street A fortification during the Civil War, Fort Wood was constructed by Union Army in 1863. The National Park Service has placed several war-era cannons in the neighborhood. In the 1880s, the fort and surrounding land was auctioned off. In time, Fort Wood became one of Chattanooga's finest residential neighborhoods. Large, fashionable homes soon appeared in the Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and Romanesque Revival styles. Fort Wood's revitalization began with the Warner House at the corner of Vine and Palmetto Streets. Also, the City Council gave the Fort Wood area statutory zoning protection and many more houses were under renovation. Today, many of the homes in Fort Wood have been converted into apartments. Indeed, student apartments in this area are highly sought after by UTC students who wish to live off, but close to, the campus. On April 17, 1979, Fort Wood Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The term covers a variety of sects, not centrally organized and may not be connected to a specific tariqat. One was founded by Qalandar Yusuf al-Andalusi of Andalusia, Spain. They were mostly in Iran, Central Asia, India and Pakistan. Starting in the early 12th century, the movement gained popularity in Greater Khorasan and neighbouring regions, including South Asia. The first references are found in the 11th-century prose text Qalandarname (The Tale of the Kalandar) attributed to Ansarƒ´ Harawƒ´. The term Qalandariyyat (the Qalandar condition) appears to be first applied by Sanai Ghaznavi (died 1131) in seminal poetic works where diverse practices are described. Particular to the qalandar genre of poetry are terms that refer to gambling, games, intoxicants and Nazar ila'l-murd, themes commonly referred to as kufriyyat or kharabat. The genre was further developed by poets such as Fakhr- al-Din Iraqi and Farid al-Din Attar. Origin The Qalandariyya are an unorthodox tariqa of Sufi dervishes that originated in medieval al-Andalus as an answer to the state sponsored Zahirism of the Almohad Caliphate. From there they quickly spread into North Africa, the Mashriq, Greater Iran, Central Asia and Pakistan Ivanov, Sergej Arkadevich (2006) Holy fools in Byzantium and beyond Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, page 368, de Bruijn, J.

(1992) The Legacy of Medi√¶val Persian Sufism Khaniqahi Nimatullahi, London, pp. 61‚Äì75, Qalandariyya in South Asia The Qalandariya may have arisen from the earlier Malamatiyya and exhibited some Buddhist and Hindu influences in South Asia. The Malamatiya condemned the use of drugs and dressed only in blankets or in hip-length hairshirts. Bu Ali Shah Qalandar was an important Indian qalandar. It spread to Hazrat Pandua in Bengal through the efforts of Shah Shafi ad-Din. The writings of qalandars were not a mere celebration of libertinism, but antinomial practices of affirmation from negative action. The order was often viewed suspiciously by authorities. The term remains in popular culture. Sufi qawwali singers the Sabri brothers and international Qawwali star Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan favoured the chant dam a dam masta qalandar (with every breath ecstatic Qalandar!), and a similar refrain appeared in a hit song from Runa Laila from movie Ek Se Badhkar Ek that became a dancefloor crossover hit in the 1970s. In Pakistan and North India, descendants of Qalandariyah faqirs now form a distinct community, known as the Qalandar biradari. Qalandariyya and Shia Islam Dhamaal Songs honoring famous qalandars are called qalandri dhamaal in Pakistan. Dhamaal are a popular South Asian musical subgenre about Sufi saints such as Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. These songs typically incorporate qawwali styles as well as different local folk styles, such as bhangra and intense naqareh or dhol drumming.Malik, Iftikhar Haider (2006).

Biography He was born at Zullichau (Prussia). He became a medical man, visited Switzerland for the first time in 1790, and became so enamoured of it that he spent three years exploring the country and collecting all kinds of information relating to it. The result was the publication (Z√ºrich, 1793) of his Anleitung, auf die n√ºtzlichste und genussvollste Art in der Schweitz zu reisen (2 vols), in which he gave a complete account of the country, the General Information sections being followed by an alphabetically arranged list of places, with descriptions. It at once superseded all other works of the kind, and was the best Swiss guidebook until the appearance of Murray (1838). It was particularly strong on the geological and historical sides. The second (1804‚Äì1805) and third (1809‚Äì1810) editions filled four volumes, but the following (the 8th appeared in 1843) were in a single volume. The work was translated into French in 1795 (many later editions) and into English (by 1818). Ebel also published a work (2 vols, Leipzig, 1798 1802) entitled Schilderungen der Gebirgsv√∂lker der Schweiz, which deals mainly with the pastoral cantons of Glarus and Appenzell. In 1801 he was naturalized a Swiss citizen, and settled down in Z√ºrich. In 1808 he issued his chief geological work, √úber den Bau der Erde im Alpengebirge (Z√ºrich, 2 vols). He took an active share in promoting all that could make his adopted country better known, e.g. Heinrich Keller's map (1813), the building of a hotel on the Rigi (1816), and the preparation of a panorama from that point (1823). From 1810 onwards he lived at Z√ºrich, with the family of his friend, Conrad Escher von der Linth (1767‚Äì1823), a celebrated engineer.

officially the ' (; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology Long before the Spanish colonizers landed on the Philippine shores, there were already natives living in this place. These people live in huts built on the hillsides located at the northern and eastern parts of the valley. This was so because the present valley was then the course of the Bakun River. For many years, the natives lived simply but peacefully. Such peaceful life did not last forever for it was soon disturbed by an unusual and fearful occurrence in the people‚Äôs environment. It all started with the continuous heavy downpour or ‚ÄúLEMLEM‚Äù in the native dialect. This ‚Äúlemlem‚Äù caused the Bakun River to swell to an extraordinary size and overflow its banks. In the middle part of the river, there was a big ‚ÄúALICONO‚Äù or whirlpool which the people feared so much. Even after the rains ceased, the ‚Äòalicono‚Äô remained; so the people believed it to Kabunian‚Äôs (GOD) punishment for their sins. As it was their custom, the people held native feast called ‚Äúkaniaw‚Äù, the ‚Äúalicono‚Äù vanished and the Bakun River changed its course to the foot of the mountains in the southern part leaving a dry level land suited for residential lots and farms. The people moved their homes to the valley and named the place ALILEM after the ‚ÄúALICONO‚Äù and ‚ÄúLEMLEM‚Äù. History Accurate and reliable information on the exact date of the founding of the town cannot be secured because there are no complete historical records available. However, basing from its information gathered from the old folks, it could be deduced that the town of Alilem was founded sometime after 1820. What is certainly known only is that the lay-out of the town was done by the Spaniards. During the Spanish occupation, Alilem was noted for being the center of the district government of ‚Äúcommandancia politico-militar‚Äù of Amburayan. This commandancia was composed of Alilem, Sigay, Suyo, Tagudin, Sudipen, San Gabriel and Bakun. In 1908, the commandancia of amburayan became a sub-province of the newly created special capital of the sub-province until the Americans transferred the seat to Tagudin.

According to the , it has a population of people. Settlements in the municipality are mostly established along the roads and in the areas near the people‚Äôs sources of livelihood. With limited economic opportunities in the municipality, some residents of the town have also left their town to seek higher education, better employment opportunities, better opportunities for trade and commerce not only to other more developed areas in the country but even abroad. Etymology The municipality of Banayoyo was originally called ‚ÄúBacsayan‚Äù. How it got its present name could be recounted by the following story: in the eastern part of Poblacion, there was a big tree, which was called ‚ÄúBanayoyo‚Äù. The people built a ‚ÄúDap-ay‚Äù under the shady branches of the big tree, where the old folks held their meetings and settled any disputes or criminal acts committed by the barangay folks. After every bountiful harvest, the people gathered around the ‚ÄúBanayoyo‚Äù tree and offered their thanksgiving in a festivity called ‚ÄúKaniaw‚Äù, the rituals lasting for three days. Due to old age, the big ‚ÄúBanayoyo‚Äù tree died. The death of the big tree brought famine and drought. The calamity prompted the older folks to gather in the ‚ÄúDap-ay‚Äù and decided to change the name of the community. The people thought of a name so that the big ‚ÄúBanayoyo‚Äù tree will always be remembered, and called the place ‚ÄúBanayoyo‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúBacsayan‚Äù. History =Creation of the municipality= In its earliest stage, Banayoyo was a ‚Äúrancheria‚Äù (or a pasture land under the Spanish regime). But as more people from the highlands of Abra called ‚ÄúTinguians‚Äù came to settle, it developed into a small community. Before Banayoyo became a township, during the 18th century, it was part of the now municicpalities of Candon and Santiago. Reliable sources indicate that lands existing in the southern part of the town, particularly from Barangay Cadanglaan in the south-west to the Barangay Lopez in the Southeast, were registered in the local civil registrar at Candon, while lands in the northern part were also registered in the local civil registrar at Santiago before they were given new declarations by the local civil registrar of Banayoyo. It was only in the year 1907 when Banayoyo gained its township, separating itself from Candon and Santiago. In 1912, it became a Municipality under Ilocos Sur Province. =World War II= During World War II, Banayoyo was once the seat of ongoing local Philippine Commonwealth Military and Ilocano Guerilla Resistance Outfit, under the command of Army Major Walter M. Cushing, a fearless American fighter. The closeness of the residents to the Guerilla Outfit by way of provisions and financial assistance irked the Japanese Imperial Army, who were then garrisoned at an old Sugar Central in nearby Bucong, a barrio of Candon. Angry patrols of the Japanese Imperial Army burned down some barrios of Banayoyo. Barangay Elefante, which was the bivouac area of the elements of the ‚ÄúM‚Äù Company, 121st Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP NL, suffered the worst atrocities. On October 16, 1944, one half of the barrio was burned down and on November 14, 1944 the other half met the same fate. During the same dates, not only Elefante was set on fire but the whole town. The Banayoyo Catholic Church was not spared nor the Municipal Hall. Geography The municipality of Banayoyo is one of the 36 municipalities of Ilocos Sur in Region I. It is bounded on the south by the Bucong River, also called ‚ÄúCarayan a Bassit‚Äù; on the west by a small canal called ‚ÄúCalip‚Äù; on the east by the Cabcaburao Hills, and on the north by Bay- asan Hills. Municipalities abutting the town area are: on the east by Lidlidda; on the south by Candon; on the west by Santiago; and on the north by Burgos. Banayoyo, which is one of the interior towns of Ilocos Sur, is approximately east of the Manila North Road. It is south of Vigan, the provincial capital city; north-east of Candon; from San Fernando, La Union, the regional capital; from Baguio City; and from Manila. The municipality can be reached by jeepneys going to Lidlidda and San Emilio or tricycles from Candon. =Barangays= Banayoyo is politically subdivided into 14 barangays. * Bagbagotot * Banbanaal * Bisangol * Cadanglaan * Casilagan Norte * Casilagan Sur * Elefante * Guardia * Lintic * Lopez * Montero * Naguimba * Pila * Poblacion =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Banayoyo was people, with a density of . Many religions have been established in the municipality like Protestantism, Catholicism, Iglesia ni Cristo, Aglipayan, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. Many residents have been given elementary and secondary education with the establishment of several elementary schools. Socio- Economic-Cultural Development Tinguians were the foremost inhabitants of the place, who came down from the highlands of Abra. With the coming of the Spaniards, Americans, Japanese, Chinese and other foreigners and people from nearby provinces of Ilocos Norte, La Union and Mountain Province, the original settlers intermingled with and intermarried with them,. At present, however, remnants of the Tinguian tribe still reside in the town. Like before, farming is the major source of livelihood of the people. During the early period, they used crude methods of farming like plowing by the use of cows and carabaos, and tilling the soil by the hands or sticks. But with the coming of the Westerners who brought with them modern technologies, the farmers of Banayoyo have already adopted semi-mechanized methods of farming like the use of tractors, threshers, commercial fertilizers, etc. References External links * Banayoyo Profile at PhilAtlas.com *Pasyalang Ilocos Sur *Philippine Standard Geographic Code *Philippine Census Information *Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Ilocos Sur ","title":"Banayoyo"},{"id":"2068411","text":"', officially the ' (; ), is a in the province of , .

History =Creation of the municipality= Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo first arrived in Ilocos in 1571 and began setting up tribunals that soon became the seat of municipal governance. Augustinian friars followed in 1572 built the convent and house of worship that later became Iglesia Parroquial de San Agust√≠n (St. Augustine Parish Church). But it was only in 1591 that the parish was recognized or first established, while the town of Bantay was formally founded as a pueblo in 1593 because it was formerly part of Vigan. It is one of the thirty-four (34) towns of the Province of Ilocos Sur, the legal basis of its creation is the Maura Law of 1893 and, thus, was constituted as a separate political subdivision during the American Regime. =Early history= The early Spanish settlers made the town beautiful by building the 'tribunal', otherwise known as the town hall, the church, bell tower, roads and streets by forced labor. The St. Augustine Church was originally made of bamboo and cogon structure by Bantay residents to house the miraculous Image of Our Lady of Charity, but it was later-on changed into a permanent edifice (built and completed in 1590) because of the good fortune it brought to the people. The Augustinian friars chose St. Augustine de Hippo, the Doctor of Grace, as the Patron Saint and the town fiesta used to be celebrated every 28 August, but because of inclement weather during this month, Most Rev. Alfredo Verzosa (Parish Priest, 1912-1916) caused the transfer of the festivity to May 5 every year. The original inhabitants of the town have family names with letter \\"P\\" taken from the designated listing, as an adopted system of the Spanish rulers in all towns of Ilocos Sur, to easily identify and monitor movement of residents. In a report of Most Reverend Bishop Domingo de Soria on August 15, 1613, the population of Bantay was 4,000 souls while at that time, Vigan has only 2,000. This can be explained by the fact that by then, Bantay parish was very extensive and broad the inclusions of the parishes of Magsingal(separated in 1676), Santo Domingo (separated in 1742), San Ildefonso (separated in 1769), San Vicente (Separated in 1795), Santa Catalina de Baba (separated in 1795) and Santa Catalina de Alexandria (now Santa) within its coverage or \\"bisitas\\". One of the Augustinian friars, Rev. Francisco Lopez, a great Augustinian philologist, with the help of Pedro Bukaneg, the blind genius of the Ilocano tongue who was from this place and author of the epic - \\"Biag Ni Lam-ang\\", labored hard to translate the Bellarmine Cathechism originally written by Robert Cardinal Bellarmine. The book was approved at the Bantay Convent in 1616 printed in Malayan Script and Spanish alphabet and was first published in 1621. The Bellarmine Catechism was the first book in Ilocano to be printed and its influence on the morality, culture and language of the entire Ilocos is measurable. Several battles have spillovers in Bantay, one of which was the Ilocos Revolution (Dec. 24, 1762 to May 1763) led by Diego Silang. Here, this heroic figure resolved to kill the bishop-elect Bernardo Ustariz and all Spanish friars imprisoned by him in Bantay. The prisoners prayed fervently to Our Lady of Charity for their deliverance until a Spanish mestizo nicknamed \\"Miguel Vicos\\" treacherously killed Silang on May 28, 1763, with a pistol at his makeshift fort on a place on a hillside referred to as Calle Encuentro (now Crisologo Street). For the Spaniards, Vicos was their savior and to his honor a commemorative monument was erected in 1763 which became the epitome of the Town Plaza. It is replaced later by a memorial to Diego Silang towards the end of the 19th century. =Contemporary History= Inspired with the common vision that it will strengthen and improve the totality of local governance, Municipal buildings [Annex I (Legislative Building) and Annex II (Puericulture Building)] were blessed and inaugurated on December 23, 1999, and May 5, 2003, respectively. Considered as major breakthroughs and milestone feats in the History of Bantay, these massive structures were built to 'reinforce' the Old(Main) Building in order to meet the vast administrative demands and service requirements of the publice clientele. Sourced from Provincial and Municipal funds, these expansion edifices are the lasting tributes of the municipal andministrators (1998-2001 and 2001-2004) showcasing local accomplishment and a legacy during their incumbency. ;Dur-as Bantay Era The Municipality holds the distinction of being the first Local Government Unit in Ilocos Sur to use an Electronic Scoreboard in a sporting event (the first ever to do so in the province was the University of Northern Philippines); the first to open hiking trails; and the first municipality in Ilocos Sur to hold a National Shootfest. Geography Bantay is north of San Fernando City, La Union, the Regional Capital of Ilocos Region, from Metro Manila, and from Vigan City, the provincial capital. Bantay has an average elevation of 100 meters (328.08 feet), with a land area of . It is bounded by Vigan City and the municipalities of Caoayan, San Vicente, Santa Catalina, Santo Domingo, and Magsingal, Ilocos Sur; and San Quintin in the neighboring province of Abra. It is an elevated and hilly municipality but some barangays, especially those near creeks, are being flooded during heavy typhoons. =Barangays= Bantay is politically subdivided into 34 barangays. =Climate= Flora and Fauna Bantay's reserved forests and farms make it home to a diverse range of plants, animals, and river creatures. Around more than 60 species can be found in Bantay including over 9 mammal, reptile (including monitor lizards), and amphibian species; 10 bird and fish species; several insects and plants are existing in the farms and wild. Typical of places all over the Philippines, cattle and water buffalo are domesticated. Herons are often sighted in rice paddies, and beetles (especially the \\"aros-aros\\" and the \\"abal-abal\\") and crickets come seasonally. Mudfish, carp, the Abra River eel, and other fish abound in its rivers and creeks, most of which are also seasonal. Monkeys, wild boar, and wild chickens can be seen in the mountains, but not as plentiful as before. Spanish plum trees (known locally as \\"sarguelas\\") abound in the municipality, especially in Barangays Paing and Banaoang. Valuable lumber trees such as mahogany and molave abound in its mountains, especially in Caniao. Bamboo also abound in the municipality, especially the \\"bayug,\\" \\"bikal,\\" and \\"bulo\\" (\\"buho\\") varieties. Demographics In the , the population of Bantay was people, with a density of . =Religion= St Augustine Church, one of two parochial churches in Bantay (the other being in Barangay Paing). About 94% of the total inhabitants are Christians, while the remaining 6% are Muslims or belong to other major religions/sects like . In the total population of Christian Bantayenos, Roman Catholics are 99%. Since it was occupied by Spaniards during the Early Colonial Period. =Language= Since the Ilocano language is the mother tongue of the Ilocanos, most of the Bantaye√±os especially the Muslims and Indians speak it alongside Tagalog. However, in schools and during Legislative Sessions (by the Sangguniang Bayan), they are required to speak English. * Ilocano - 97% * Tagalog - 2% * English - 1% Local government For the 2010-2013 term, Samuel C. Parilla is the elected mayor of the town (since 1988-1998; 2007‚Äìpresent), with Floro Jose P. Peredo, Sr. as the vice mayor. The municipality's Sangguniang Bayan members include William Pre, Roberto Reboroso, William Pacpaco, Ireneo Quintinita, Edilberto Mercurio, Nick Pamuspusan, Arnold Paz, and George Leones. Also in the Sangguniang Bayan are ABC President Gloria Ramirez and Sangguniang Kabataan Federated President Jonalyn Pre. Attractions Bantay Church Bell Tower sit at the top of the hill Santa and Bantay = Cultural and historical = ;Bantay Parish: One of two parishes in the municipality. It serves as the Sanctuary of Nuestra Se√±ora de La Caridad, the Queen of Ilocandia. The church and bell tower are considered to be the two of the oldest structures in the province, as the bell tower was built in 1590 and the church was in the following year. The place, especially the bell tower, is a tourist attraction mostly accessed from Vigan by means of calesas. The original beauty of the structures are still preserved until today. ;Quirino Bridge: This scenic arch bridge traversing the Abra River is located between two beautiful mountains and is built to honor then-President Elpidio Quirino. It was once partly destroyed by Super Typhoon Feria, hence a different-looking third quarter portion. On December 2007, Chinese engineers and a local construction company started to build a new, 456 meter-long replacement, a stone's throw from the original bridge. It was officially opened by then- President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on December 30, 2009. The old bridge, an iconic symbol of Ilocos Sur, is currently preserved as a tourist attraction, doubling as a backup in case the main bridge is damaged by typhoons. = Natural = ;Carballo Mountains: The municipality is home to a portion of this mountain range that overlooks the Cagayan Valley and portions of Babuyan Islands, and to which the municipality partly owes its name. The range has two popular mountain peaks, Caniao and Tupira. This is one of the few mountain ranges in Ilocos Sur and the only natural tourist spot of Bantay aside from the Abra River. It has forests and crystal-clear springs, which also supplies drinking water to most of Metro Vigan. It is a destination of the Philippine Army and habitat of unique species like wild pigs and monkeys. Today it is a location of firing ranges, some telecommunications relay facilities (often mistaken by locals as a radar array), and hiking trails. It also houses the headquarters and nursery for a reforestation project conducted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Education =Colleges= There are two major educational institutions in Bantay: *St. Paul College of Ilocos Sur (formerly Rosary College) - The oldest privately funded school in Ilocos Sur, founded as an all-girls' educational institution by the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres in Vigan. Its former campus near the Vigan Cathedral is now the site of a shopping mall, having recently fully transferred to nearby Bantay. It has recently joined the Saint Paul University System. *Ilocos Sur Community College (ISCC) - A college being operated by the provincial government, with its campus located near Quirino Stadium. The college was founded in 1975. =High schools= *Bantay National High School *Tay-ac National High School References External links * Bantay Profile at PhilAtlas.com *Pasyalang Ilocos Sur Category:Municipalities of Ilocos Sur Category:Populated places on the Abra River ","title":"Bantay"},{"id":"2068412","text":"', officially the ' (; ) is a in the province of , .

The resulting town became Nueva Coveta. It was envied by its neighbors because of its peace and order, as well as its progress, since it sold its resulting products in places as far as Pangasinan and Tarlac.

Etymology right During pre-Spanish times the port of Pandan was an important trading post for Chinese and inter-island vessels, and one of the commodities once traded there was bamboo. With the arrival of the Spaniards came the project to identify the names of places in the Philippines. Spaniards, patrolling the area for pirates known as tirong, came to a place near the island called Puro, and asked the name of the place. Thinking that the Spaniards wanted to know the name of the bamboo floating in rafts on the Baggoc River waiting to be traded, they answered \\"kawayan.\\" The Spaniard then listed the place's name as Caoayan. From that time on, the place's registered name was Caoayan, and has been registered as a barrio of the capital town Bigaan. It became a parish in 1825. The first missionaries that founded Saint Paul College of Ilocos Sur landed in Pandan. A commemorative marker stands at Pandan Port to commemorate the event. History Caoayan, which was once a barrio of Ciudad Fernandina, now Vigan, became a municipality in 1911. Don Dimas Querubin was the town‚Äôs founder and got elected as the first municipal mayor. He was succeeded by his son, Don Asterio Q. Querubin I, who served for four terms and became president of the Mayors' League of Ilocos Sur. Barangays Caoayan is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. Climate Demographics In the , the population of Caoayan was people, with a density of . Economy Caoayan Welcome Arch A series of roadside eateries just outside of the town's parish church in Caoayan, Ilocos Sur Due to its geographical location, fishing has been the main source of livelihood of the inhabitants. Next is agriculture where farmers planted onions, tomatoes, rice and corn bound. The town is also known for its loom-weaving industry which dates back before Spanish regime. Palafox and Associates have declared Caoayan as the fish-bowl and onion basket of Ilocos Sur. Boat-sailing was one of the major industries of Caoayan but was eased out as means of transportation with the onset of modern highways especially those connecting the Ilocos provinces to Manila and the Cagayan Valley. The provincial government has recognized the Caoayano skill by awarding locals who are engaged in boat-making and calesa-manufacturing as living legends of Ilocos Sur. Currently, LGU-Caoayan has launched the country's first ever One-Barangay, One-Product (OBOP) program. Although its official One-Town, One-Product (OTOP) as per DTI's initiatives is Abel Iloko, only 5 out of the 17 barangays are into loom-weaving. Under Mayor Goulart, the OBOP was designed to give all barangays equal economic development opportunity. Under this program, non- Abel Iloko barangays are empowered to adopt their respective OBOPs depending on the raw materials that are indigenous and abundant in their communities. The OBOP has now produced a wide array of local products: processed Rosangis (clam shells), Bagoong Ipon, native Cakes and Delicacies, processed peanuts, Pickled Singkamas (turnips), Smoked Tilapia, Corn Husk souvenir items, Water Lily handicrafts, Smoked/De- boned Bangus (milkfish), with others that are following soon. Abel Iloko weavers have also undergone training programs that will enable them to come up with high-end Abel outputs. Caoayan is also presently riding on the coattails of Vigan, which has been declared as one of the new 7 wonder cities of the world. To be able to get a fair share of the city's tourist influx, Caoayan opened the Pinakbet Farm in Barangay Nansuagao, offering the quintessential Ilokano dish - Pinakbet - as its centerpiece. Currently opened is the Caoayan Choco Surf Point in Barangay Manangat, a resort-type destination that offers surfing and other water-based sports classes, rejuvenating massage and the Black Sand exfoliating rub, and the resto-bar that offers drinks and seafood paella as the chef's choice. These tourism-based projects have been launched to achieve the town's vision of improving all Caoayanos' standard of living through additional revenue and employment generation.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology In the beginning, the place was only a wilderness, a thick forest where peaceful nomadic tribesman roamed and hunted. For fish, which were also abundant, there was a river. On these occasional visits, the hunters noticed the fertile and flatlands that can be tilled and they decided to stay. They were the first settlers. As to how the name of the town evolved, there are interesting legends transmitted through generations. Some claimed that during the pre-Hispanic regime, there were also numerous uncivilized warring tribes. Kabu Angaw, a man with a good sense of humor headed one such tribe. In an intertribal rivalry, Kabu Angaw suffered defeat forcing him and his remaining warriors to move southward until they reached the village where the friendly and hospitable nomads settled. Kabu Angaw's natural carefree manners and ability to relate entertaining stories endeared him to the settlers especially the young. His fairness and righteousness earned him respect and esteem, eventually making him as the village chieftain. His leadership became legendary so much that his people were referred to as ‚Äú taga Kabu Angaw‚Äù. When he died, the villagers deeply mourned on such a great loss. On the other hand, some assert that the village by the river was ruled by a certain Aggao. When the Spaniards arrived, his subjects called him ‚ÄúCabo Aggao‚Äù meant chief. Finding difficulty in pronouncing the headman's name, the Spaniards contracted it to ‚Äú Cabugao‚Äù denoting not only the ruler but also the place he ruled. As time passed, Kabu Angaw or Cabogao was transformed into Cabugao. Geography Cabugao is the second northernmost town of the province of Ilocos Sur. It is from Vigan City, the capital of the province; from Laoag City, the capital of Ilocos Norte; from the San Fernando, La Union, the regional center; and north of Manila. It is accessible to almost all modes of land transportation and a 7‚Äìkilometer portion of the MacArthur Highway passes through the town center. Its total land area is . It is bounded on the north by Sinait; on the south by San Juan; on the east by Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte and the Cordillera Mountain Ranges; and on the west by the South China Sea. =Topography= The Cordillera mountain range borders on the eastern part of the municipality. Hills are located in all the four corners of the municipality. Off the coast of Barangay Sabang there is Salomague Island. The Cabugao River is the largest river in the municipality. Two tributaries to the east feed the main channel of the Cabugao River. The headwaters of the north fork of the Cabugao River originate in Sitio Caset in Barangay Maradodon and the southern fork's headwaters originate in Sitio Gaco in Barangay Cacadiran. Cabugao's drinking water supply comes from three water resources in the Cordillera mountain range. The barangays that lie along the Cabugao River are flood prone areas during the rainy season. The uncontrollable surges of water erode the properties that line the Cabugao River endangering life and limb. The creek that runs through the poblacion easily clogs up in rain causing portions near it to be inundated. =Barangays= The municipality of Cabugao is divided into thirty-three (33) barangays, four (4) in the poblacion and twenty-nine (29) in the rural areas, further subdivided into ninety-four (94) sitios. =Climate= The climate of Cabugao is characterized by two (2) well-pronounced seasons; dry and wet. Dry season is usually experienced from November to April; while wet (rainy) season starts in May until October. Occasional rainfall also occurs at the onset of the dry season caused by the north-east monsoon passing through the region. The town is naturally shielded from the trade winds by the Cordillera Mountain Ranges. In the middle of May, drift winds from the Pacific Ocean sweep over the area, signaling the imminent wet season. Temperature ranges from or a minimum temperature of and a maximum. Average relative humidity is 87.3%. Demographics In the , the population of Cabugao, was people, with a density of . The first data on population of the Municipality of Cabugao was recorded on March 2, 1903, indicating 8,848 residents. This number steadily increased to 35,706 in the 2010 census. The biggest population increase was on December 31, 1918 with 3,754. =Religion= The people of Cabugao are generally religious. A majority of the population is Roman Catholic, while a sizable number practice other religions such as the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, Iglesia ni Cristo, various Protestants groups, the Church of Jesus the Latter Day Saints, and Islam. Economy People are primarily engaged in farming and fishing. Cabugao, with its big poblacion, is one of the most urbanized towns in the province. While it is true that many natives of the town have gone to greener pastures in other parts of the country and abroad, the number of migrants has been offset by the number of immigrants ‚Äì Pangasinenses, Bataguenos, Kapampangans and Maranaos who have come for trade and commerce and have stayed here for good. People's organizations and non- government organizations are active in the municipality responding to the needs of the community. Points of interest ;Pug-os: Located along the national highway and two (2) kilometers north of the poblacion, boasts of its fine beach ‚Äì its white sand stretching to more than half a kilometer. This attribute and the gradually sloping seabed make it a top favorite among town mates and tourists for swimming, picnics or fun hiking. Two hotel beach resorts, Ponce del Mar and restaurant, and the privately leased municipality- owned Cabugao Public Beach and Park (renamed Cabugao Beach Resort) serve as venues for conventions, conferences, seminars and social occasions such as weddings, baptisms and birthdays. For those who want to seek the thrill of the paranormal, Pug-os National High School should be the perfect place to visit. Not only you can admire the history of the school, but you can also experience the haunting at that school, such as the famous white lady which walks or appears during a full moon or light rainy evening, a poltergeist in a classroom that is said to move chairs and is usually active a few hours before the morning classes starts, and the mysterious student found pacing in a certain unoccupied room in the school campus.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDyG0ezi_Fw ;Salomague: The historic port of Salomague located in this barangay explains why it holds the distinction of being one of the few Ilocos barangays printed on international mariners‚Äô map. The Port of Salomague was an ancient port of call of seafarers, merchants and traders from different Asian countries. During the American occupation, it served as a mooring place from boats that ferried across the Pacific where thousands of Ilocanos worked at sugar plantations in Hawaii and California. Now leased to a private corporation, It is the transshipment port of goods and products to Taiwan. It is also the unloading point of commercial fishing vessels. The Salomague Island is used to have inhabitants until the owners choose to have it uninhabited. A 1109-hectare island, it can be reached in less than five (5) minutes ride through a banca. A municipal ordinance has declared the waters around it a fish sanctuary area, thus making it more attractive to sports fishers and scuba divers who regularly visit it. Picnickers also frequent its eastern coast. ;Dardarat: Eco-tourism structures were in place in Barangay Dardarat attracting hordes of town mates and local tourists and earning for its barangay captain a prestigious award until typhoon ‚ÄúFeria‚Äù unleashed her fury razing down to the seafloor said structures. Only mangrove seedlings planted by teachers and Japanese volunteers provide the contrast to a now, desolate coastland. At the southern end of the place is the Dardarat Lighthouse, a Philippine Coast Guard facility that guides marine vessels. ;Sabang: Sabang is the take-off point for Salomague Island. Members of the Saint Claire, a Roman Catholic religious congregation, have established a place in the barangay facing Salomague Island. ;Salapasap: During the peak season of beach-lovers, Salapasap Beach is good alternative to Pug-os Beach. Barangay cottages are rented out of cheap rates. ;Namruangan: Namruangan is known for its rich fishing grounds. Situated at the mouth of Cabugao River, it shares with barangay Salapasap the ‚Äúipon‚Äù (small fish) fishing ground. ‚ÄúBugi‚Äù (fry) abound in the place. During clear weather and fish season, fisherfolk gracefully pull the ‚Äúdaklis‚Äù (a big fishing net) to the tune of an Ilokano folksong. ;Daclapan: Daclapan is also a good place for swimming and picnics. Daclapan Coast or Cabugao Bay in local maps, is closely guarded by the barangay inhabitants against illegal fishing. ;Saint Mark the Evangelist Parish Church: Built in 1772, it lost part of its aesthetics when it was burned in 1965. The architectural charm of its interiors was no longer restored. However, renovation in recent years has improved its beauty. ;Old Cabugao Public Market: This was the first project of the then Mayor Pacifico P Apostol. This has been converted to Cabugao Park. ;Municipal Government Center: Several public buildings and structures converge in the Municipal Government Center. Among them are the municipal hall, the 66-year-old Lady Magarang, World War II Veterans‚Äô Memorial, Children's Park and the Cabugao Cultural and Sports Complex. ;Northern Ilocos Sur Trade Center (NISTC): As the municipal public market, its strategic location on a spacious municipal property along the national highway north of the poblacion proper is strengthened by the proximity of the ‚Äúdayo‚Äù, the slaughterhouse compound, and of course, the municipality-owned Cabugao Ice Plant that is within its arm's reach. It is a Department of Health Awardee as the Cleanest and Healthiest Public Market in Region I for 2002. This was erected under the administration oF Mayor Andrea Soller Tan. The finishing touches and its grand opening was administered by Mayor Diocaesar C Suero. ;Historic Hills and Mountains: Hills and a mountain stand out as reminders of the valor and heroism of our people against the three colonial powers. :The Balaywak hills hosted a military outpost constructed by Diego Silang and his men in their bid to challenge the Spanish might. Balaywak was also a battle site between Gabriela Silang and her Ilocano and Tingguian allies on one hand and the Spaniards and their Filipino allies on the other hand. For those who seek for a one-of-a-kind paranormal experience, Balaywak is the place to be. The bridge found at Balaywak is said to be haunted by two white ladies and the adjacent sitios and barangays also has their own haunts.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDyG0ezi_Fw :Mount Bimmuaya, a plateau in Barangay Maradodon, was drenched with blood of at least 18 Filipinos who perished in a clash against the Americans during the Filipino-American War. :Balay-aran, a hill in Barangay Caellayan, was the birthplace and bastion of the town‚Äôs resistance movement against the Japanese occupation Army. ;Springs and Waterfalls: Several springs notably Magarang, Roma, Kinalian, Baterina and Bacques have been tapped to provide potable water to the poblacion and to some eastern barangays. A popular waterfall, Kimmandela ‚Äì so named because even from a distance it resembles a candle (\\"Kandela\\" is the Ilocano term for \\"candle\\") is a remarkable sight. The springs or waterfalls can be reached through hiker-friendly mountain trails and settlements at the foot of the Ilocos Mountain Range. ;Cabugao River: Cabugao River has two channels: one starts in Sitio Caset, Barangay Maradodon and another in Sitio Rebba, Barangay Cacadiran. The two channels meet at Barangay Alinaay and form a big branch until its mouth in Barangays Namruangan and Salapasap. It is a 12-kilometer body of water where farm animals drink and take a bath, fishermen catch fish and crabs, housewives do their laundry, and construction builders quarry stone and pebbles. The local government's program on Save Cabugao River project is a recipient of the Likas Yaman Award for Environmental Excellence as the Most Outstanding LGU-Initiated Environmental Project in Region I conferred in 2007. ;Libunao Protected Landscape: A protected watershed area in Sitio Caset, Barangay Maradodon. Culture ;Town Fiesta: The annual town fiesta is held in honor of the town's patron saint, St, Mark the Evangelist, whose feast day falls on April 25. It is usually a week-long festivity led by the municipal government and the church. Agro- industrial fairs, sports fests, indigenous cultural shows, coordinated and implemented with the assistance of farmers‚Äô groups, sports‚Äô associations, and cultural groups enliven the merrymaking. ;Cultural Gems: The creativity of the people is tangibly demonstrated through their cultural innovations, ‚ÄúAweng ti Kawayan‚Äù (Sound of the Bamboo), a musical instrument, is unique throughout Ilocandia. ‚ÄúKinnaras‚Äù, a dance reenacting how fishermen catch fish within a fish sanctuary and ‚ÄúKalapati‚Äù, a dance that mimics the graceful and gentle movements of the dove, have their origins in the town having been choreographed by the Cabugao teachers. ;Kawayan: Strength and Beauty of Cabugao: The present administration is bent on promoting ‚Äúkawayan‚Äù (Bamboo), the tallest grass, as a prime agricultural and forecast product. Bamboo culture from the choice of their planting materials to the manufacturing or fabrication of bamboo products or furniture demands strength and beauty of the character of our people. The people of Cabugao can always look up to Malakas (Strength) and Maganda (Beauty) who came from the ‚ÄúKawayan‚Äù as paragons of virtues for the development of the town. Education Cabugao has 26 public elementary schools and private primary schools, 3 public high schools ( Pug-os National High School,Cabugao [Turod] National High School, Lipit National High School, and Sisim National High School), 1 private high school (Cabugao Institute).

The municipality was the site of the Battle of Tirad Pass where General del Pilar fought to the death against the Americans. Geography The town lies among the western hills of the Cordilleras in the interior eastern portion of the province of Ilocos Sur. It is bounded in the north by the town of San Emilio, Quirino in the east, Sigay in the south and Salcedo in the west. Its 7 barangays and sitios are connected by winding foot trails and seasonal rugged roads. The town is likewise endowed with natural scenery and wonders such as the payoh or rice terraces, pristine waterfalls, and the distinctive peak of Mount Tirad. There are also trails crisscrossing Tirad Pass, which were built through polo y servicio (forced labor) during the Spanish Period. =Barangays= Gregorio del Pilar is politically subdivided into 7 barangays. * Alfonso (Tangaoan) * Bussot * Concepcion * Dapdappig (Mabatano) * Matue-Butarag * Poblacion Norte * Poblacion Sur Sitios Gregorio del Pilar is politically subdivided into 5 sitios. * Mabatano * Tangaoan * Ul-oling * Tubalina * Butarag =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Gregorio del Pilar was people, with a density of .

March, prepared for an assault of the Filipino forces fortification under the Command of General Gregorio del Pilar. On the narrow trail of Tirad Pass, the Filipino soldiers watched as the enemy began to move up the trail. On around a few hundreds yards above the pass, General Gregorio del Pilar, with his staff and accompanied by two civilians from Sitio Mabatano, spotted the American forces through his spy glass as they were starting to move. But as he watched, he noticed that the American forces broke formation and instead sent a messenger on horse back with a white banner. As the messenger was coming near the fortification of Filipino forces, the sound of a gun was heard and the messenger fell. The American forces divided into three separate groups. One group followed the trail towards the pass. Another group ascended the hill facing the Filipino soldiers stationed in the pass. The third group, led by a Filipino from the lowlands named Januario Galut, made their way up unnoticed through the old trail which was hastily barricaded by felled trees a few days before the American forces arrived. This old path lead to the place where General del Pilar stood watching. As the American forces dispersed, the general ordered the two civilians, Tucdaden and Abeng to proceed to the trenches and deliver the breakfast of the Filipino soldiers. All of a sudden continuous gunshots were heard continuously and went unabated for several hours. General del Pilar was shot and killed.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is home to the Lidlidda Protected Landscape, a protected area situated in the municipality's watershed. History In the year 1800, there lived a group of people called Agsalog (Igorot) in the East Hinterlands of Golot (Mountain Province). Some groups of these people were hospitable, while some were fierce fighters, head hunters, animal rustlers, robbers and the like which worsened the already impoverished state of their place. Tired of such constant inconveniences, the hospitable and peaceful people plotted to leave after holding a secret meeting. They grouped themselves into three: one group to head for the North, another to the South and the third to the West. Being Igorots with customs and traditions firmly instilled by their ancestors, they observed their usual religious rites before starting the journey. A number of chickens were killed and offered to Kabunian (God) and his son Lumawig. It is a peace offering meant to appease the gods in order not to anger them. After the ceremony, a safe and peaceful passage to a wonderful land destined especially for them, is expected. The night after the ceremony was held, the peaceful people started their journey. They moved silently under cover of the tall, thick trees eastward and the shining stars up above served as their guide. The group that traveled to the west were the ones who reached the place, which would be known in the future as Lidlidda. Members of this group had such names as Conay, Caoas, Digay, Caoeng, San-E, Gumanab, Anggon, Calugay and others. Along the way, they met obstacles and hardships associated with the mountainous terrain and the constant feeling of hunger and tiredness. After twenty days of hiking, they arrived in a place that looked suitable for building homes. It was a valley with grassy plains, a river along its sides, creeks, brooks, and wells. There were plenty of fish, wild animals and game for food. The surrounding hills and mountains abundantly covered with tall trees and bamboo could provide them with shade and fruit. The immediate belief that soon a peaceful, progressive and happy community would be positively established in the said place compelled the travelers to stop their seemingly nomadic existence and settle on the area. They made a begnas (fiesta) to express their gratitude to Kabunian because of their successful journey. Within three days after the fiesta, they started digging and pulling the ledda (Thick tall grasses or ‚ÄòTalahib‚Äô in the Tagalog dialect) to convert the land into rice paddies. Years passed and the population increased. The inhabitants started to search further places for food and dwelling. One time, a group of hunters saw smoke near seashore from atop of the mountains west of the place. Eager to see what was there, they bravely hiked to the place. Suddenly they came to reach a street and houses. The people who inhabited the place were Ilokanos, who were also kind and friendly. An elderly rich man met them and told them of his great desire to visit their place. He said that he wanted to make friends with them as well as barter with their goods. Furthermore, he wishes to teach religion (Christianity) to the tribe. In the process, he will teach them the three R‚Äôs of education: Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. The impressionable elderly man‚Äôs offer was highly appreciated. The rich man along with his neighbors bundled some clothes, utensils, reading and writing materials and went with the hunters. After a few hours, they reached the top of ‚ÄòBaggiing Hill‚Äô where they rested. The rich man anxiously asked how far more to go. A hunter stood and said, ‚ÄúSir, our home is located there at the edge of that plain covered with those ‚ÄòAdu nga Ledda‚Äô (many thick tall grasses)‚Äù. Then, they hurried down and in a few minutes reached the place. The natives came around and made friends with the strangers. As a show of respect and hospitality, they performed their native dances and songs and offered ricewine along with other delicious and nutritious foods. The rich man and his companions were exhilarated to meet these peaceful people. Before departing, he promised the folks that he‚Äôd visit them again. His parting words were, ‚ÄúTo all of you my beloved brethren, I am pleased and proud to say that, day by day, your living condition will surely improve and prosper because of your rich and fertile soil. Let us therefore name this place ‚ÄúLidlidda‚Äù in memory of these thick tall grasses (Ledda) whose area in the near future will be converted into ricefields‚Äù. This is how Lidlidda got its name. In 1890, the sub-province of Bangued, Abra occupied the western part of Ilocos Sur. During that period Governor Ortega, of Filipino race, was the Governor. San Esteban town was in-charge of the Lidlidda locality which automatically means that it was within the control of the Presidente of San Esteban. It did not last long, however, because the people of Lidlidda launched a general campaign to request Governor Ortega to make Lidlidda a township. The governor authorized the Presidente of San Esteban town to assist in appointing Mr. Manog Caoas, the choice of the people, as the first Presidente of Lidlidda Township. The barrios of Lidlidda were: Callitong, Patac, Sabangan Pinggan, Bessang, Balugang, Mapanit, Banucal, Bequi-Walin, Camatlioan (San Vicente), Nalasin (Poblacion Norte), Kuwangi (Poblacion Sur), Suysuyan, Carcarabasa, Bugui, Calungbuyan, Labut and Tay-ac. After Caoas‚Äô term (1908‚Äì1910) a man named Andan Domaoa became the Second Presidente. Before his term ended, he sanctioned the separation of the barrios of Mapanit, Bessang, Patac, Balugang, Callitong, and Sabangan Pinggan from the township of Lidlidda to be made part of the town of Burgos, Ilocos Sur. He served from 1911-1913. Miguel Segundo became the third head of the town. Upon assuming his office, he immediately worked for the conversion of the township into a full municipality. Barangays Lidlidda is politically subdivided into 11 barangays. * Banucal * Bequi-Walin * Bugui * Calungbuyan * Carcarabasa * Labut * Poblacion Norte (Namatting) * Poblacion Sur (Surong) * San Vicente (Kamatliwan) * Suysuyan * Tay-ac Climate Demographics In the , the population of Lidlidda was people, with a density of .

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is officially the Summer Capital of Ilocos Sur. It has a relatively cooler climate than most of lowland Ilocos Sur due to its geographical location and proximity to Mountain Province and Benguet. The municipality is home to the Bessang Pass Natural Monument. Etymology How it got the name is not known or documented but it is believed that it was named after the famous poet Miguel de Cervantes. But the town's history was tied to the poet's name and the people living on the town adopted it as their own official name. History The earliest known historical document about Cervantes was that, it started as a small Igorot Village known as ‚ÄúMantamang‚Äù, an Igorot word meaning ‚Äúto look over‚Äù. Igorot traders and Chinese merchants who always had to pass the village frequently used man and horse trails connecting the lowland and upland neighboring localities. On March 4, 1879, the residents of Mantamang petitioned that the village be recognized as a Christian town under Lepanto-Amburayan sub-province of Mountain Province. The town was given the name Cervantes and that remained the name of the town up to the present. Maximo Lilio de Garcia has written that Cervantes was formerly a barrio when it was founded by the Spanish colonizers. It started with only thirty (30) houses made of light building materials like bamboo and cogon. In spite of the fertile lands that abound the place the native used to cultivate only small patches of ricefield, which made the barrio unprogressive. Lilio further stated that Cervantes has a distance of twenty-four (24) kilometers from Lepanto. The system of communication was maintained on a weekly basis due to its poor road that traversed the sloppy mountains zigzagging upward the hills back of Cayus where the storage house was located and down to the lowlands reaching the Malaya River, which sometimes overflow during rainy season making the trail slippery. During the Spanish Era, a portion of the land near the Abra River bank was used as a penal colony by the Spanish soldiers who brought with them the Ilocanos from the lowlands. In 1883, a Malaria epidemic affected the colony prompting the Spanish officials to move to the upland, which is now the present location of the town proper. 5,000 grams of quinine ended the epidemic. At that time the barrio was founded between Abra and Malaya Rivers, the inhabitants were distributed among the three (3) rancheria. The first settlement was established on an elevated healthful well-ventilated place, where a small house for the children of the neighboring barrios a storage building for tobacco and barracks were constructed. Springs were the source of potable clean and abundant water supply. The natives cultivated and produced vegetables and fruits suitable to the climate. Coffee was produced on the land annexed to the commendancia. The next group of settlement founded a rancheria less than a half-kilometer distance from the first settlement. This time better types of houses were built with an estimated population of 819 residents migrating from other rancherias and barrios of Mailac Cambaguio and Magucmay. Then another small community was developed with both sections of Cervantes where a spacious administrative building, other ruinous edifices and barracks built of wood for the civil guards, were located. Gradually these original settlers of the area, the Igorot were displaced and forced to move to the hills and mountains. This explains why at present Igorot are mostly settled in far-flung barrios while the Ilocanos, mestizos and those who intermarried with Chinese, Spaniards, Americans and other foreigners populate the central area of the municipality. The constantly growing of trade in this mountain area made it necessary that it should have a good outlet to the coast. A road was constructed from Cervantes going west over the Malaya Range exiting at the town of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur. This road was later improved and widened and became passable all the way to Bontoc. During the American rule, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. 410 and Sec. 1 of said act, states: ‚ÄúThe territory hitherto comprised in the Commendancia of Lepanto, Bontoc and Amburayan, together with territory lying between the boundaries of Abra, Cagayan and Bontoc and not hitherto include within the limits of any province organized under the provincial government act is hereby constituted a province, which shall be known as the Province of Lepanto-Bontoc. This province as divided into three sub-provinces. The sub-province of Lepanto that shall comprise the territory hitherto included in the commendancia of Lepanto. The sub-province of Bontoc that shall comprise the territory hitherto includes in the commendancia of Bontoc and not hitherto included within the boundaries of any province organized under the Provincial Government Act. The sub- province of Amburayan, which shall comprise the territory hitherto included in the commendancia of Amburayan. The town Cervantes prior to its becoming a seat of government of Amburayan sub-province of Mountain Provbince was a capital of a military province by the Americans when they captured Cervantes. Its military governor was William Dinweddie. Later on, Cervantes became a pueblo by virtue of Act No. 441 of the Philippine Commission, which is an act providing for the establishment of a local civil government in the townships and settlements of the Province of Lepanto-Bontoc. And in 1907, Cervantes was transferred to the Province of Ilocos Sur by virtue of the provisions of Act No. 1646, passed by the Philippines Commission on May 15, 1907 providing for the transfer of all sub-provinces of Amburayan and large sections of Lepanto and Benguet to Ilocos Sur and La Union. In June 1945 the USAFIP NL spearheaded by the 121st Infantry, defeated the Japanese Imperial Forces at Bessang Pass, part of Malaya, Cervantes. During the Japanese occupation it was at Cervantes, particularly at Bessang Pass, that the Japanese forces made their last stand in the operations in the North against a band of Filipino Soldiers and Guerrillas. These events hasten the surrender of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who is referred to as the ‚ÄúTiger of Malaya‚Äù. In 1945, Cervantes was burned and destroyed. The brick municipal building, Conchar Hotel, and the sturdy and beautiful houses of the town were burned and reduced to ashes. The main bridge that links Cervantes to Bontoc was bombed. A handsome monument was unveiled in 1954 at Bessang Pass in honor of the 1,395 United States Armed Forces in the Philippines - Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL) members killed in this historical place. After the war the town is on its way to recovery and self-sufficiency. The Cervantes Elementary School is here since the Spanish Regime. It now has 18 primary and Elementary Schools. Saint Agnes Elementary School was founded on February 18, 1920 and on June 10, 1949 the CICM and ICM missionaries inaugurated the Saint Agnes High School. In 1972 Republic Act 4424 established the Cervantes National School of Arts and Trade, which at present the Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College- Cervantes Campus. Another milestone of education was in 1999 when the Cervantes National High School was established, through the initiative of Mayor Benjamin N. Maggay during his first term. The Cervantes Emergency Hospital was established in 1916 through the initiative of then Governor Calvo of Mt. Province. In June 1960, republic Act No. 2775 changed the name of the Cervantes Emergency hospital to Bessang Pass Memorial Hospital in memory of the heroes of Bessang Pass. Cervantes was energized on March 21, 1991. The power supply came from Mt. Province Electric Cooperative (MOPRECO) through a memorandum of agreement with Ilocos Sur Electric Cooperative (ISECO). Cervantes became the Summer Capital of the Province of Ilocos Sur by Resolution No. 88 Series of 1993 ‚ÄúA Resolution Declaring Cervantes as the Summer Capital of the Province of Ilocos Sur on March 23, 1993. On July 5, 1995 an interim Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) was organized and on April 23, 2000 President Joseph Ejercito Estrada signed Proclamation No. 284 declaring Bessang Pass National Shrine as Protected Areas (included to NIPAS Act of 1992 or RA 7560) under Natural Monument/Landmark Category. On June 11, 1996 the Municipal Government passed Resolution No. 025 series of 1996 declaring June 14 as special non-working holiday for the town of Cervantes.

Captain Juan de Salcedo had a hand in founding the municipality. But before he reached the current site of the poblacion, he came to a village called Malongon, about one-half kilometer to the south. The leader of the village refused Salcedo's request to establish a municipality there, but suggested that he establish the town a half kilometer north of the village, and the belltower be moved to that site, hence the origin of the town's name. History Itnegs were the original inhabitants of the place when Salcedo arrived. He worked for the conversion of the people to Christianity, but not all accepted the new faith.

Etymology The Spaniards named the pueblo (the equivalent of a municipality in present-day terms) San Esteban (formerly known as Cabagbagototan) because they have received reports of a vagabond named Iban having been stoned to death and beheaded by hostile natives in the place called \\"Naglawlawayan,\\" which is an early place of worship by the natives, and currently the site of the municipal cemetery. \\"Iban\\" is the Ilocano equivalent of \\"Stephen,\\" hence the pueblo being named San Esteban. San Esteban was founded by Agustinian friars in 1625, but was always attached to Nueva Coveta (present-day Burgos) and to the municipality of Santiago until 1911.

San Ildefonso is from Metro Manila and from Vigan City, the provincial capital. Etymology San Ildefonso, like many other places in the provinces at the beginning of the Spanish Regime, did not have a name. Sometime in 1625, its inhabitants decided to give it a name, but nothing came out after more than five hours of discussions. So while thinking of a name, they decided to go fishing for a week. And while preparing to go fishing, they saw a box floating not far from shore. Wading to reach the box and carrying it ashore, they opened the box to find a statue of Saint Ildephonsus. The young women of the place carried the statue to the center of the village, where it was enshrined in a small hut for many years. He became the patron saint of the municipality, and his name was decided to become the name of the fledgling municipality. San Ildefonso was a former rancheria of Bantay before it became a municipality, but because of its size it was annexed to Santo Domingo as a barrio. In 1921, Assemblyman (and future Philippine president) Elpidio Quirino worked to convert San Ildefonso into a municipality again.

San Juan is from Metro Manila and from Vigan City, the provincial capital. History The town of Lapog was established in 1772. The name of the municipality has gone through a series of changes. The early settlers and occupants called it \\"Lapo\\", short for \\"Lapo-Lapo\\", a tall grass which grew everywhere in the area. In the year 1772, Don Tomas Aquino, the first local leader, initiated the organization of the scattered communities into one, calling the place \\"Lapog\\", a derivative of local vernacular \\"Lap- Lapog\\" which means unirrigated land. For 189 years, \\"Lapog\\" remained in the records as the official name of the town until June 18, 1961, Republic Act No. 3386 was enacted and it was renamed to San Juan. Since most of the inhabitants were of the belief that religious names bring peace, happiness, and prosperity, the town was renamed \\"San Juan\\", after the name of its patron saint, Saint John the Baptist. It was stricken by all sorts of plagues and epidemics (like the smallpox epidemics of 1808 and 1918‚Äì19, locust infestation in 1903, and destruction of ricefields by worms called \\"arabas\\" in 1905).

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is known for its production of beautiful furniture made from narra and other tropical hardwoods, even from old wood previously used in wooden sugarcane crushers and old houses to make reproduction antiques. Etymology The municipality's name came from the name of Saint Vincent Ferrer, whose winged statue was found inside a box entangled in fishing nets. The fishermen consulted this matter to the friars in Villa Fernandina (now Vigan), who identified the person depicted by the statue. The statue was carried to the town's center, where a church was built. From then on, the town formerly known as Tuanong (sometimes called Taonan) became San Vicente. History In tracing the history of San Vicente, one always has to start from Vigan. Vigan was established by the Spanish colonizer, Juan de Salcedo on June 13, 1573 up to 1582, there were only 800 residents. Upon Salcedo‚Äôs return in 1574, he brought with them the Augustinian friars in order to teach Christianity to the inhabitants. After Salcedo‚Äôs death on March 11, 1576, Franciscan friars replaced the Augustinians in the year 1579. These same friars spread up to San Vicente to convert the people to the Catholic faith. In 1591, Vigan has already an organized form of government, which included these barrios namely: Bo. Tuanong, Bo. Santa Catalina de Baba and Bo. Caoayan. There were then a population numbering about 4,000 inhabitants. Between the years 1720 and 1737, the first chapel of Bo. Tuanong was erected. Later in 1748, the Confraternity of Jesus of Nazareth was organized. In one record of the Vigan Convent archives, a funeral that happened on January 29, 1748 at the Chapel Bo. Tuanong was recorded. Two chaplains Bro. Don Agustin de la Encarnacion and Don Pedro Geronimo de Barba were the priest stone the chapel in that year 1748. It is believed that the chapel is the first stone building that sees upon entering the San Vicente Central School from the main road. Bo. Tuanong which belonged to Vigan was the old name of San Vicente. On June 16, 1751, the chaplain was Don Miguel de Montanez. He was the first priest there and also in the chapel of San Sebastian. It is found out that Barangay San Sebastian already erected. Hardship in reaching Bo. Tuanong and Bo. Santa Catalina de Baba from Vigan especially during the months of June to October was experienced, due to the absence of dike or bridge. Priests from Vigan reached these places by means of a raft. The problem prompted the separation of these two barrios from Vigan in 1793. In 1795, it was the initiation of the seat of municipality and the church and Bo. Tuanong became San Vicente de Ferrer. Don Pedro de Leon was the first parish priest and he was believed as the initiator of the construction of the Church of San Vicente.

The feast of the town is celebrated every 25th day of November to celebrate the feast day of Saint Catherine of Alexandria (the town's patron saint). Etymology When the Augustinians were busy with the Christianization of the Ilocos Region, a group of missionaries sailed westward through the river known as \\"El Mestizo\\" to the place now called Santa Catalina. They were also looking for fresh water, since the area where he landed yielded only salty water. When they finally found a fresh water spring up north, and were busy quenching their thirst, some of them saw an image of a beautiful lady near the place where he drank, which disappeared after a few minutes. One of them recognized the image as that of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The Augustinians returned to Villa Fernandina (Vigan) and reported this matter to their superiors. This resulted in the construction of a church in the town with Saint Catherine of Alexandria as the patron saint. It was also declared that Santa Catalina be the name of the town. A replica of the cross once planted by Salcedo and his party‚Äîto signify that the Spanish has conquered the area‚Äîstands near the entrance to the municipality.

As of February 2006, Santa Catalina with a poverty incidence of 7.9 percent and Vigan City with a poverty incidence of 8.6 percent, are the top two municipalities/cities with lowest poverty incidences in Ilocos Sur, and for the entire northern Luzon. This is among the results of the Poverty Mapping Project implemented by the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) with funding assistance from the World Bank ASEM Trust Fund in response to the increasing demand for local level poverty estimates. Economy and Business =Agriculture= A total of 696.5888 hectares or 74.581% of the total land area of Santa Catalina is utilized for crop production. Croplands are found in every barangay. The whole area of 696.588 hectares is planted with rice during rainy season. 30 hectares or 4.31 percent of the total agricultural land is planted with white corn while 20 hectares or 2.87 percent are planted with corn. Next to rice/corn season, farmers also plant vegetables with a total effective area of 1,150 hectares or 165.09 percent of the agricultural lands. Onions, cabbage, cauliflower, sweet pepper, eggplant, beans, tomato, sweet potato, yam beans, mongo and peanut are the vegetables that are planted. Because of the limited agricultural land in the municipality, inter cropping farming system are commonly practiced. As had been mentioned earlier that 696.588 hectares are planted with rice and corn while 1,150 hectares are planted with vegetable. This municipality has been known as the ‚ÄúVEGETABLE BOWL OF THE NORTH‚Äù. The total value of vegetable production alone is PhP 523.04 million that brings a lot of income to farmers. =Poultry, Livestock And Fisheries= The farmers in the locality do not produce livestock or poultry in commercial scale but mostly on the backyard level. Livestock such as cows and water buffalo were being raised to help farmers in their farm needs and serves as working animal. Likewise goats were raised but not in herds and these are for local and home consumption of the farmers. Likewise farmers do not raise poultry in commercial scale but they raised chickens in backyard scale. Most farmers raised fighting cocks which commands higher prices in the market. The total area for fishponds is 53.9021 hectares. These fishponds are almost located in every barangay but the biggest area is at barangay Cabittaogan. Fishponds are classified as a) brackish pond where milkfish are cultured, b) freshwater for the production of tilapia, c) fish cages, d) Municipal fishing grounds which were found within 15 kilometers from the shoreline of coastal barangay and e) communal fishing grounds found in Govantes River. =Light Industries= Santa Catalina also has manufacturing of concrete well rings-a material used as reservoir in the making of open-dug wells to irrigate farm lots. There are also service-oriented industries such as gravel and sand businesses that cater to the needs of the Housing Sector and the metal crafts that manufacture sidecars for motorized-tricycles. These industries do have limited employment. One pioneering industry in the locality is the manufacture of Cigars but this industry is already nearing its extinction because of lack of the raw materials (native tobacco) that were used in the manufacture. We do have also the Onion Dehydration Plant an industry that pulverized onion that was exported in different Asian countries. The reason why this dehydrating plant had closed was because of dollar fluctuations. =Trade= The main source of income for the locals include farming, fishing and small-scale businesses. As with most Philippine towns, the phenomenon of migrant labor has also contributed much to the development of the town. It is evidenced by the numerous mansions and large houses that dot the area along with the vast expanse of active farms and fields.

History Before the Spanish Conquest of the Philippines, Moro raiders were in control, so one of the tasks of the Spanish was to pacify and clear the country of these pirates. Coastal communities (Northern Luzon, and, thus, Ilocos) were prone to piratical attacks. For these, watchtowers were erected all over the Ilocos coast. The Spanish started patrols of sea lanes, stopping these pirates for a while, only for them to resurface in 1772. But in the place now known as Santiago, as the Spanish engaged the pirates, all church bells ringing and trumpets sounded (to signal their attacks), the Augustinians stationed in the place held a statue of Santiago (Saint James) facing the sea and with many natives praying the rosary for safety and victory. The Moros fled, never to return, thus sparing the pueblo. The place was since then named Santiago. It was once a visita of Narvacan due to the lack of ministers at the time.

History The name of the municipality came from its old moniker, \\"Paggappuan ti Santol ti Domingo,\\" an Ilocano term meaning \\"The source of the Santol sold every Sunday.\\" Santol (Sandoricum koetjape) is the name of the tree bearing round, yellowish fruits growing in abundance in the municipality, notably in Barangay Pussuac. During the Spanish era, an enlisted man of the Spanish Civil Guard, Pablo Arquero, looked for the source of the santol being sold in the markets of Ciudad Fernandina (now Vigan City) on Sundays during the months of June to August. To do so, he asked for a leave of absence from his platoon leader to trace the source of the fruits. With his Ilocano guide, he searched the lands north of Villa Fernandina. He found nothing in the neighboring towns of Bantay, Santa Catalina, San Vicente, and Bantaoay (now San Ildefonso). He finally found many santol-bearing trees in a place north of Bantaoay now called Barangay Pus-uac. He has found the \\"Paggappuan ti Santol ti Domingo.\\" The town was named Santo Domingo on account of this feat. Don Pablo Arguero was claimed to be the founder of the municipality on May 12, 1742, with Father Tomas Millan as the first parish priest. Father Millan laid the foundation of the belfry, where the great Filipino hero Diego Silang once worked as a boy. In 2010, the University of Northern Philippines opened a campus in Quimmarayan.

According to the , it has a population of people. Nestled near the Cordillera ranges, Sigay has crisp cool air and rustic scenery. Known to nature-lovers, adventurers, campers and mountaineers, the town attracts visitors with its version of the rice terraces, the Aw-asen Falls, the kilometric hanging bridge, and its picturesque rivers. History Natives of the town claim that Sigay is as old as any other place in the province founded during the Spanish regime. But written records are yet to be found regarding its history. Oral tradition, however, has it that the name of the town originated from the ilocano term for fish trap, \\"sigay\\". The legend goes that, in the older times, Lake Ban-ao in Barangay Mabileg was once the village's most valuable source of fish. Around the area, one of the better-known fish species, the mudfish, apparently - in a fish trap, and brought the fish to the market. A Spaniard came along and asked where she got the fish. thinking that the stranger was asking about the gear she caught the fish with, she answered, \\"Sigay\\". It was by this incidence that the town started to be known by that name. Another version of the etymology situates the legend in a setting when the \\"sigay\\" itself had to be re-invented for hunting. In those times, the village was still made up of \\"tribu\\" or tribes. As was the custom, each tribu chose a leader who ought to be the strongest, most fearless, and bravest in the clans. one of the leaders, and his hunters, loved to climb the mountains to hunt for food. Because it would then be easier to trap the animals in the forests, than run after them for the kill, the hunters devised a big net in the fashion of the \\"sigay\\" (fish trap/net). Hunting thus became much more uncomplicated. Because of the widespread use of the \\"sigay\\" both in the water and in the jungles, the lowland people who visited the place would eventually refer to it as Sigay. The original settlers of Sigay were Igorots, or Pagans, who wandered from their ancestral lands in the Mountain Provinces north-westward to the Ilocos uplands. Many of them found a home in the mountains of Sigay. Years later, the natives' descendants made vows in marriage with pretty Ilocanas. Their offspring were born mestizos - fair skinned, red lipped, pink cheeked and brown haired - and became known as the \\"New Ilocanos\\". In the year 1700, when Christianity was introduced in the interior towns, baptized children were proclaimed as the \\"New Christians\\" or in Tagalog, the \\"BAGO\\". To this day, descendants of the Igorot natives, the Bago tribes continue to live in Sigay. The Bago people are religious, thrifty, hospitable and cooperative. Although most of the area has been modernized, there are definite traces of the native customs and beliefs. For instance, to this day, the dance \\"Tadek\\" is performed during the wedding celebrations. In many sitios, the bayanihan spirit generally prevails, especially when building houses, or during the planting and harvest seasons. However, some of the older rituals like the Kanlaw are no longer performed, unless necessary. To the Bagos of past years, the family was the basic unit of society, and the members were expected to work hand in hand to earn a living. The men, as head of the family, were usually the breadwinners. These days, however, owing perhaps to poverty, the wives are often seen helping their husbands earn money - whether in the farm, the forest, in the family business, or as government employees/workers, in order to make ends meet. The people prefer a peaceful life to complexities; nonetheless they aspire for economic and infrastructure development in the municipality, especially the development of the main road that would connect them to the lowland urban centers, where they would sell their goods, and eventually be able to augment to the family income. Many members of the Bago tribe from Sigay ventured into the municipality of Tabuk - the capital town of what was then the province of Kalinga-Apayao - in the 1940s well into the 1950s. There, they found settlements which were then exclusively made up of settlers with Sigay origin - the most notable of which is the barangay of Casigayan (with the Sigay still kept in the name), which literally means \\"a place of Sigay people.\\" =Establishment of the Municipality= By the time the Spaniards arrived in the northern part of the country, all the interior towns of Ilocos Sur were part of Montanosa or the Mountain Provinces. A sub- province of Montanosa was that of Amburayan, a prominent area of trade and commerce, which among others, included the towns of Gregorio del Pilar, Quirino, Cervantes, Lidlidda and San Emilio. Called after the vast Amburayan River that cascaded through it, and nurtured its fields, Amburayan was a vast stronghold of the natives; the river itself, fed by the springs from the mountains in the East, was wide, and foreign vessels used to dock there to trade with the natives. When the Spanish founded Ciudad Fernandina (Vigan), all the interior towns, Sigay included, were cut off Montanosa, and these became part of the Province of Ilocos Sur. The original inhabitants were natives and had the same facial features as the Igorots. Although already fully recognized by the Spanish Regime as a municipal district town in the 1800s, it was only in 1960 that Sigay emerged as a fully-fledged municipality, that which the residents called the New Era of Sigay. This came after the first elections of its local officials on November 12, 1959. Today, Sigay is composed of seven barangays: Mabileg, Poblacion, San Ramon, San Elias, Abaccan, Matallucod, and Santo Rosario. For a long time, the seat of local government resided in Abaccan. Later on, the local executive, Mayor Simeon Wandas (1960‚Äì1977) decided to build a Municipal Hall in Maday-aw (now, Poblacion) where, eventually, he transferred all the local government's occupations, including the Municipal Police Station. Geography Sigay is bordered on the north by the Municipality of Gregorio del Pilar, south by the Municipality of Suyo; east by the Municipality of Quirino, and west by the Municipality of Santa Cruz. Sigay can be reached one and a half hour ride from the City of Candon through strong-geared vehicles traversing 30 km, 22 km concrete and 8 km rugged roads, passing stony rivers crossing several times and going up through mountain terrains. During rainy season, the place is isolated by swollen rivers and muddy slippery roads. Residents adopt themselves by negotiating distances by hike. The Municipality is nestled in a wide mountainous area where most of its forest is still untouched. Both ends of the Municipality is bounded with rivers namely Quinibor Rivers at the north, and Ida, Suyo Rivers in the south. Its type of soil is best suited to diversified crops. The town has a total land area of 80.28 km2. comprising seven barangays. The place has a vast mountain ranges and forest wherein bountiful forest products abound. =Barangays= Sigay is politically subdivided into 7 barangays. * Abaccan * Mabileg * Matallucod * Poblacion (Madayaw) * San Elias * San Ramon * Santo Rosario =Climate= The climate pattern of Sigay has two pronounced season, wet and dry season. The type of season is very common not only in the nearby towns but in the entire region as well. The wet or rainy season is from the months of June to October and dry season is from the months November to May. The place is cold throughout the year due to the altitude of the town. The coldest months are from November to February. Demographics In the , the population of Sigay was people, with a density of . The municipality's population started a total number of eleven inhabitants during the 1930 National Census of Population, and gradually increased to 1,036 in the following years of census (1908 census) with a highest geometric growth rate in its history at 33.26% per year. This end dates back to the time when the Bago tribes still growing, as describe in the municipal legend. During those times only mountain trails to trek on, and the residents have abundant virgin resources abound. Perhaps, the first sixteen (16) years of relatively rapid population increase is a classic example of what geographic information about the land, and demography, for that matter would certainly bring to an upland municipality. =Language= The language dialect used by the residents in the place is purely Ilocano, although many residents specially young can understand and speak English and Tagalog. The use of Filipino or Tagalog as a medium of instruction in the elementary school helps the children understand and speak the language. =Religion= There were many religious sects being practiced in this place. The Roman Catholic consists most in terms of the percentage of the population while the so-called Protestants were the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, The Way of Salvation, Seventh Day Adventist and the Assemblies of God and Jehovah's Witnesses. Economy The town of Sigay is predominantly an agricultural municipality. Though the area is rugged and mountainous, it has a wide level areas suited for agriculture. Most of the resident engaged and raised crops like tobacco, coffee which is their main products and primary source of livelihood. The place has no public market up to the present so the residents need to transport their farm products to the lowlands for proper disposal and convert it into cash to buy their some basic needs especially during rainy season. Since most of the families, agriculture is their main source of income not only in this municipality. Indeed, the Department of Agriculture want to alleviate poverty, enhance income, profit and put into secured food sufficiency. To achieve these visions and aspirations, the department in consultation with our constituents at the grass roots level and other appropriate government agencies and offices, shall formulate and implement a medium and long term comprehensive Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plan. Education The municipality have seven schools including the Secondary School. There are two primaries which were situated at Barangay Mabileg and Barangay Matallucod while there were four elementary schools. One is Sigay Central School situated at Barangay San Ramon. Another is Abaccan Elementary School and the other two were San Elias Elementary School and Santo Rosario Elementary School. The secondary school is located at Poblacion which is now on its 8th year of operation. Because education is very important, the local officials strive more to provide school facilities and other needs to improve the newly established secondary school other than providing facilities, there are also employed teachers shouldered by the local funds to hep the school to its successful and continues operation.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is the northernmost municipality of the province and is from the provincial capital, Vigan, from Laoag, and from Manila. Because of its main commodity, garlic, Sinait is also known as the Garlic Center of the North. History Before Magellan discovered the Philippines in 1521, the locality was only a small village of little over a hundred natives who were called \\"Tirongs.\\" By nature, these primitive inhabitants were sea-faring warlike. In their fast and picturesque sailboats, they traveled to adjoining and distant places, most particularly to settlements and villages along the Ilocos Coast in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan and even Zambales. In those adventures, the ‚ÄúTirongs ‚Äú always challenged the people encountered to tribal wars and fought small battles against them. Often, those sturdy and brave natives came out victorious. Even in their daily chores, those people showed their ferocious characteristics. When the renowned Iberians came, Salcedo was sent to explore and colonized the Ilocos territory during the early years of the Spanish regime, he found the ‚ÄúTirongs‚Äù of Sinait in apogee of the social state. Small battles were daily occurrence so that in the year 1535, when the locality was organized and established as a ‚ÄúPueblo‚Äù Salcedo named the new community as ‚ÄúSIN-NAIT‚Äù, a word in the local tongue which means ‚ÄúCONTEST‚Äù. As a pueblo, SINAIT embraced and included in its territorial limit such as distant places as RANCHERA DE PAUR‚Äù, now the Municipality of Nueva Era in Ilocos Norte and Southern barrios of Badoc of the same Province. The vast territory, however, was reduced to present 78 square kilometers. In the year 1575, the natives fully realized the hardships of pronouncing the term ‚ÄúSIN-NAIT‚Äù and to go away with the trouble, Salcedo declared that one of the letter ‚ÄúN‚Äù be dropped. Since then, this Municipality has been called ‚ÄúSINAIT‚Äù. Nevertheless, it was only in 1913 when the same was ‚Äúdeeded‚Äù by the government upon the initiative of the late Don Calixto Cabacungan so that the Municipality Council enacted a resolution to that effect, that SINAIT was adopted as official name of the community to which said resolution was duly approved by the Provincial board of Ilocos Sur and by the Defunct Philippine Legislature. =The Santo Cristo Milagroso= The Chapel of the Santo Cristo Milagroso in Dadalaquiten Norte (the white building), taken from the Chapel of the La Virgen Milagrosa in nearby Paguetpet, Badoc. The body of water in the picture is part of the seashore where the two images were allegedly found floating in a box. Sinait houses the Sanctuary of the Miraculous Statue of the Black Nazarene (El Santo Cristo Milagroso), fondly called by its residents as \\"Apo Lakay,\\" and a treasure of Ilocandia. History traces the life-sized statue to Nagasaki, Japan. It was probably sent floating in the sea by missionaries operating in secret in Japan (for fear of persecution during the Tokugawa Bakufu). The box was found by local fishermen in the shores of Barangay Dadalaquiten Norte, on the boundary between Sinait and nearby Paguetpet (La Virgen Milagrosa), Badoc, in the year 1620, and fishermen from both towns carried it ashore. They found two statues inside the box‚Äîa statue of the Black Nazarene, and a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. According to legend, The fishermen from Sinait mysteriously were unable to move the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, but had no problems moving the Statue of the Black Nazarene. The fishermen from Badoc, however, were able to move the Statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary (later called the La Virgen Milagrosa) with ease, as they were unable to carry the image of the Black Nazarene. They took the statues to their respective towns, hence becoming their patron saints. In 1656, with a spreading devotion to the Santo Cristo Milagroso due to its miraculous powers, the Black Crucifix was taken to the capital town of Vigan, since an epidemic was raging there and through the devotion of the faithful, many got cured. Because of this, it is considered as an intercessor of all kinds of affliction and sickness. In 1660, because of the growing veneration to the image, the faithful begun the construction of a permanent edifice to house it. It took the people of Sinait eight years to construct the church with funds provides by the Spanish Audiencia. Today the landing site of Apo Lakay still exists in Barangay Dadalaquiten Norte, and is a place of pilgrimage for devotees. Barangays Sinait is politically subdivided into 44 barangays.

His best known recordings are \\"T-99 Blues\\" and \\"Meet Me With Your Black Dress On\\". Nelson notably worked with Duke Robillard and Otis Grand. Career Nelson got his start singing in church. In 1941, he saw a performance by Big Joe Turner while he was visiting Oakland, California, and realized he wanted to sing the blues.Liner notes to \\"Rockin' and Shoutin' the Blues by Roger Wood Turner taught Nelson about singing, performance and the music business.

Henderson was dubbed the Butcher of Bahrain due to torture and the numerous human rights violations that were alleged to have taken place under his command there, especially during 1990s uprising in Bahrain. Henderson was born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in 1927 but grew up among the Kikuyu in Kenya and lived most of his life overseas. He served as a Colonial Police Officer in Kenya during the 1950s and was famed for his role in capturing Mau Mau rebel leader Dedan Kimathi, about which he wrote the book, The Hunt for Kimathi, also published under the title Man Hunt in Kenya by Doubleday. In 1954 Henderson was awarded the George Medal, the second- highest award for bravery not in combat, and later a bar to the George Medal, for suppressing the Mau Mau uprising. \\"Ian Henderson has probably done more than any single individual to bring the Emergency to an end\\" wrote General Sir Gerald Lathbury when he left Kenya in 1957. After independence, he was deported from Kenya and moved to Bahrain. He was employed as the head of the General Directorate for State Security Investigations in Bahrain for some 30 years, retiring from his position in February 1998. He was accused of complicity in torture during the period of protracted social unrest of 1990s uprising in Bahrain, leading to an investigation by British authorities in 2000. The investigation was concluded in August 2001 and no charges were filed, despite thorough documentation by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch of the torture. He always denied any involvement in torture, despite the release of the documentary \\"Blind Eye to the Butcher\\" which contains evidence and interviews with the disfigured torture victims who identify Ian Henderson. While the chief of the Bahrain police, Ian Henderson personally interviewed North Korean agent Kim Hyon-hui and her accomplice Kim Seung-il. The pair had travelled to Bahrain posing as Japanese tourists after planting a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858. Henderson managed to prevent Hyon- hui from taking a cyanide pill secreted in a cigarette she was carrying. Ian Henderson was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II with the OBE (1984), George Medal (1954) (and Bar (1955)) and the King's Police and Fire Services Medal (1953). He was honoured by Government of Bahrain with The Order of Shaikh 'Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa (Wisam al-Shaikh 'Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa) Exceptional Class (2000), The Order of Bahrain (Wisam al-Bahrein) 1st Class (1983) and The Medal of Military Merit (Wissam al-Khidmat al-Askari) 1st Class (1982). Ian Henderson's character was played by George Kennedy in the 1990 Korean film Mayumi, portraying his interrogation of Kim Hyon-hui. Death Ian Henderson died on 13 April 2013 at the age of 86.

According to the , it has a population of people. Agoo is from Metro Manila and from San Fernando, the provincial capital. Geography Agoo and La Union are part of the Ilocos Region, which is located on the narrow plain between the Cordillera Central and the West Philippine Sea. Agoo itself is one of the southern municipalities and is bounded on the north by Aringay, on the east by the municipality of Tubao further up the foothills of the Cordilleras, and on the south by Santo Tomas. Agoo's western shores consist of a long beach facing the West Philippine sea. The Agoo River, which is sometimes wrongly named the Principe River after the Taytay Principe Bridge which traverses it along the main highway, flows through the town from uphill in the east to where it meets the West Philippine Sea in the west. Etymology The name agoo is usually attributed to \\"aroo\\" or \\"agoho,\\" a pine-like evergreen tree (Casuarina equisetifolia or Whistling Pine) that thrived in the western coast during the pre-Spanish Period.General Information History Agoo's administrative dates back further than most Philippine municipalities, with the town being established within the same decade that the Spanish colonizers arrived on the Island of Luzon. The history of the settlement now known as Agoo dates back even further, with both documentary and artifactual evidence supporting the assertion that it was a major port of call for foreign traders before it was formally established by the Spaniards. =Early history= Before the province of La Union was established, Agoo was part of Pangasinan, and was a settlement of people of the \\"same race as those of Pangasinan.\\" These people traded with Chinese merchants long before Columbus even sailed to the new world, as shown by the porcelain and pottery excavated from the site of the Catholic church during its renovation - now kept in the Museo de Iloko. Later, the Japanese came and established their first settlement in the Philippines. At this time, Agoo's coast was shaped in such a way that it was a good harbor for foreign vessels coming into Lingayen Gulf. =Spanish colonial era= Sighting by Juan de Salcedo In 1572, Juan de Salcedo, fresh from his conquest of Southern Luzon, was ordered by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi to explore Northern Luzon and ‚Äúpacify the people in it‚Äù. In June 1572, he was traversing the Angalakan River, when he saw and attacked three Japanese ships. When they fled, Salcedo followed them until they landed at a Japanese settlement. After paying tributes, the Japanese were allowed to remain. These Japanese would leave when the port of Agoo was later closed, but not without first teaching the natives their methods of fish culture, rice cultivation, deerskin tanning, duck breeding, and weapons manufacturing.  Establishment by the Franciscans  A permanent settlement was established in Agoo in 1578 when two Franciscan Missionaries, Fray Juan Bautista Lucarelli of Italy and Fray Sebastian de Baeza of Spain, constructed a thatch and bamboo church in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Agoo encompassed a vast land area that spanned the modern day towns of Rosario, Santo Tomas, Tubao, Pugo, Aringay, Caba, Bauang and the place called \\"Atuley\\" or present day San Juan. Agoo became the center of the campaign of pacification and conquest, not only of the surrounding towns that would later become La Union, but of the mountain tribes in the Cordilleras as well. The two missionaries formally proclaimed Agoo as a civic unit. naming it after the river along whose banks it was built. At the time, the riverbank was forested with pine-like trees locally called \\"aroo\\" or \\"agoho\\" (Casuarina equisetifolia, or Whistling Pine). In another claim of the town's name origin, Agoo was said to be derived from a variety of flying fish (chileopogon agoo), thus \\"agoo,\\" by which Japanese settlers called it thereafter.  El Puerto de Japon  During the early years of the Spanish colonial period, Agoo continued to be an important point of trade with Japan. Miguel De Loarca referred to Agoo as ‚ÄúEl Puerto de Japon‚Äù - the Japanese Port. Rosario Mendoza-Cortes, in her book \\"Pangasinan 1572-1800\\" notes that Agoo was the region's primary port of call for Japanese and Chinese traders - with the only other contender for the honor being Sual, Pangasinan. This was because there was a Japanese colony there, because traders at Agoo would have access to a greater number of people, and it was nearer to China and Japan. The main product traded from the area was deer pelt, which was shipped to Japan. Agoo's role as a port deteriorated when the Spanish closed the Philippines to foreign trade. When foreign trade was allowed again, the shape of the gulf had changed and it was thus Sual that became the dominant port. Development by the Augustinians Most of the town's early development can be attributed to the efforts of the Augustinian Order. They took over from the Franciscans and administered the town off and on throughout the Spanish occupation until the secular priests took over in 1898. Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity They changed the town's patron saint to Santa Monica. They established a school where reading, writing, industrial works, and catechism were taught. They relocated the town center, laid out the streets and public buildings, and established roads leading to the nearby towns. To facilitate the construction of churches, public buildings and bridges, they taught the people brick and lime making, brick-laying, and stone-quarrying. They introduced the ‚Äúmoro- moro‚Äù, the singing of ‚Äúpasyon‚Äù, new farm implement and new plants. Father Aquilino Garcia constructed a church, and by the end of the 15th century the image of Nuestra Se√±ora de Caridad (Our Lady of Charity) was installed in it. This church was destroyed in 1796 and a new one was built when the original settlement was moved to what has ever since been the town center. The church was then claimed to be the largest and grandest in northern Luzon during that time. Ruins are scattered althroughout the town's center and some are visible at this point of time.  Battle of Agoo (1661)  In 1661, Andres Malong of Pangasinan failed to recover La Union from the Spaniards after the Battle of Agoo.  1849 Integration into La Union On October 29, 1849, Governor General Claveria issued a promovido to fuse the Pangasinan-Ilocos-Cordillera areas into La Union. On March 2, 1850, Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco signed the Superior Decreto of La Union (34th province from Cebu-1565), with Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera as the first Gobernador Military y Politico. Isabella II of Spain decreed the province's creation on April 18, 1854. The new province comprised the north-western towns of Pangasinan and the towns of Ilocos Sur south of the Amburayan river. Agoo was the oldest town to be integrated and was listed as having a population of 6,936 people. = World War II = In the early morning of 22 December 1941, Agoo was one of three beachheads taken by the invasion force of General Masaharu Homma during the Japanese Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. The Japanese' 47th Infantry Regiment under the command of Col Isamu Yanagi, accompanied by the 4th Tank Regiment and supported by a flotilla of the Imperial Japanese Navy led by Vice Admiral Kenzaburo Hara (consisting of the light cruiser , destroyers , , , , , , three minesweepers, six anti-submarine craft and six transports) was supposed to land on the beaches of Agoo beginning 5:00 A.M. on December 22, 1941, having left Takao on Taiwan the evening of December 18. The Japanese 47th Infantry and 4th Tank Regiment were confronted by heavy weather, however, and were thus delayed and dispersed. They landed at about 7:30 A.M. on a four-mile stretch of beach all the way from Agoo to just north of Damortis. Agoo is thus recorded in WWII annals as one of the Japanese staging points for the Battle of Rosario. = Martial law = President Ferdinand Marcos' 1972 declaration of martial law had little political effect within Agoo itself, although there were some Agoo natives, such as then-Davao Archbishop Antonio L. Mabutas, who spoke against the human rights abuses during martial law. Marcos had strong political ties to La Union, notably Jose D. Aspiras whom he appointed as Tourism Minister. He also allowed the powerful family factions which had dominated La Union politics since before the American colonial era to stay in place.Turner, Mark M. (1989) Elites and Power in a Philippine Town. Under Martial Law, 1972-76. Philippine Studies 37: 283-300. Marcos' efforts to consolidate political power did not get much resistance in the La Union, including Agoo, since Marcos' use of violent methods for stifling dissent thus mostly took place in other, non-Ilocano provinces, such as nearby Abra, Kalinga, and Mountain Province.Cortes, Rosario Mendoza. (1990) Pangasinan, 1901-1986: A Political, Socioeconomic and Cultural History. New Day Publishers. Since Bishop Mabutas was in Davao at the time, though, he was aware of human rights abuses in that city, particulaly the torture and killings of church workers. The pastoral letter he wrote against Martial law, ‚ÄúReign of Terror in the Countryside,‚Äù is notable for having been the first pastoral to be written against Marcos' martial law administration. = 1980s and 1990s =  Establishment of High School and University  On July 23, 1945 the Municipal government, then led by Mayor Miguel Fontanilla, established South Provincial High School in response to education-oriented citizen Ramon Mabutas' calls for the establishment of a public high school. South Provincial High School turned Agoo into a center of education for Southern La Union, and became one of the constituent state-run schools that were combined by Presidential Decree 1778 in order to create the Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University in 1981.http://www.dmmmsu.edu.ph/index.php/transparency/about-us/history After the 1986 EDSA Revolution  After the February 1986 People Power Revolution, President Corazon Aquino placed the Philippines under a revolutionary government until the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines could be ratified. During this time, the Municipality of Agoo was placed under the administration of OIC Mayor Antonio Q. Estrada. 1990 Luzon Earthquake  At 4.26 P.M. on July 16, 1990, Agoo was hit by the 1990 Luzon earthquake, and was one of the most severely affected locales. The Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity was badly damaged, and the bell tower which was then the only remaining structure from the 1893 church, crashed completely.http://wikimapia.org/821552/Basilica-Minore-of-our-Lady-of-Charity- Agoo-La-Union The Agoo municipal building collapsed completely, killing numerous citizens who were inside because they were in line to pay in time for the national income tax deadline for that quarter. Numerous tombs in the municipal cemetery were fractured open. Alleged Marian Apparitions The town gained media attention in the early 1990s for the alleged Marian apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Judiel Nieva. Nieva reported seeing the Virgin Mary, popularly known as Our Lady of Agoo atop a Guava tree, a statue weeping with blood became highly sensationalized. Religious pilgrimages among Filipino Catholics increased by the millions as people flocked to see the phenomenon. The alleged apparition and healing events came into the attention of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, who in turn began an investigation and later released an ecclesiastical ruling that the apparitions were non-supernatural in origin in 1993. = Recent history = Election and Drug Related Violence (2010-Present) Since 2010, either the Municipality Agoo has been regularly declared an election hotspot due to incidences of violence during national and local election periods. Major incidents include the murder of former Tubao Vice Mayor Lazaro Gayo outside his law office near Agoo's Municipal Hall, and an alleged assassination attempt on Tubao Mayor Dante Garcia in the same year; and an alleged assassination attempt on former Congressman Eufranio Eriguel in 2016. Media attributed the violence to \\"intense rivalry\\" between incumbent Congressman Eufranio Eriguel and his 2010 opposing candidate, former Rep. Thomas Dumpit Jr., and later to \\"clashes between the followers\\" of Congressman Eriguel and his 2013 opponent, former Army General Mario Chan. In 2013, the declaration of the towns Tubao, Agoo, Caba, and Aringay as election hotspots compelled the Philippine National Police to temporarily remove the police chiefs of the four towns during the election period, a decision which was protested by incumbent politicians in both towns, including then-Congressman Eriguel and his wife, then-Mayor Sandra Eriguel. Also during the 2010s, a number of drug-related incidents in Agoo came to national attention. This resulted in the sacking of the police chief of Agoo, along with those of the Southern La Union towns of Bauang, Naguilan, and Tubao. On August 16, 2016, former Congressman Eriguel was included by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte as one of the local government officials and legislators allegedly involved in illegal drug trade in his \\"I am sorry for my country\\" speech. Eriguel and a number of other Southern La Union politicians denied these allegations. Failed proposed merger of Agoo and Aringay On June 11, 2014, then-representative Eufranio Eriguel filed House Bill 4644 to establish the first city in the second district by merging the municipalities of Agoo and Aringay. The bill was co- authored by La Union first district Rep. Victor Ortega and Abono party-list Rep. Francisco Emmanuel Ortega III, and was deemed necessary because neither Aringay nor Agoo alone could meet the requirements to create a Philippine city: a population of 150,000; an annual income of P100 million minimum a year; and a land area of 100 square kilometers. (As of 2014, the national census showed that Agoo and Aringay have about 65,000 and 47,500 residents, respectively. Agoo posted more than P90 million, and Aringay made P15,000 million in annual earnings, respectively) The proposed city would have two districts under a city mayor and city vice mayor along with 14 councilors in the Sangguniang Panlungsod, new positions for which the former municipal officials could run despite having the terms limits of their offices. The proposed bill sparked protests from the people of both Agoo and Aringay who did not want the merger because it would subject them to the same high local taxes as Agoo and because of concerns that Agoo and Aringay would lose their cultural identities. The proposed merger did not push through within term of the 16th Congress. Climate  Geology  According to findings of the Philippine Rice Research Institute, Agoo's land consists mostly of the San Manuel, Maligaya, Annam, and Bauang type soils.https://www.pinoyrice.com/wp- content/uploads/simplified-keys-to-soil-series-la-union.pdf Barangays Agoo is divided into 49 barangays. * Ambitacay * Balawarte * Capas * Consolacion (Poblacion) * Macalva Central * Macalva Norte * Macalva Sur * Nazareno * Purok * San Agustin East * San Agustin Norte * San Agustin Sur * San Antonino * San Antonio * San Francisco * San Isidro * San Joaquin Norte * San Joaquin Sur * San Jose Norte * San Jose Sur * San Juan * San Julian Central * San Julian East * San Julian Norte * San Julian West * San Manuel Norte * San Manuel Sur * San Marcos * San Miguel * San Nicolas Central (Poblacion) * San Nicolas East * San Nicolas Norte (Poblacion) * San Nicolas Sur (Poblacion) * San Nicolas West * San Pedro * San Roque East * San Vicente Norte * San Vicente Sur * Santa Ana * Santa Barbara (Poblacion) * Santa Fe * Santa Maria * Santa Monica * Santa Rita (Nalinac) * Santa Rita East * Santa Rita Norte * Santa Rita Sur * Santa Rita West * San Roque West Demographics In the , the population of Agoo was people, with a density of .

Designed by Anthony de Francisci, the coin was the result of a competition to find designs emblematic of peace. Its obverse represents the head and neck of the Goddess of Liberty in profile, and the reverse depicts a bald eagle at rest clutching an olive branch, with the legend \\"Peace\\". It was the last United States dollar coin to be struck for circulation in silver. With the passage of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was required to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress to pass a bill requiring the redesign, they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the redesign of United States coinage that had begun in 1907. The public believed the announced design, which included a broken sword, was illustrative of defeat, and the Mint hastily acted to remove the sword. The Peace dollar was first struck on December 28, 1921; just over a million were coined bearing a 1921 date. When the Pittman Act requirements were met in 1928, the mint ceased production of the coins, but more were struck during 1934 and 1935 as a result of further legislation. In 1965, amid much controversy, the Denver mint struck over 316,000 Peace dollars dated 1964, but these were never issued, and all are believed to have been melted.  Background and preparations  = Statutory history = The Bland‚ÄìAllison Act, passed by Congress on February 28, 1878, required the Treasury to purchase a minimum of $2 million in domestically mined silver per month and coin it into silver dollars. The Mint used a new design by engraver George T. Morgan, and struck what became known as the Morgan dollar. Many of the pieces quickly vanished into bank vaults for use as backing for paper currency redeemable in silver coin, known as silver certificates. In 1890, the purchases required under the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act were greatly increased under the terms of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Although the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, it was not until 1904 that the government struck the last of the purchased silver into dollars. Once it did, production of the coin ceased. During World War I, the German government hoped to destabilize British rule over India by spreading rumors that the British were unable to redeem for silver all of the paper currency they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of silver, caused the price of silver to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase silver to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 silver dollars at $1 per ounce of silver plus the value of the copper in the coins, and handling and transportation fees. Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new silver dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from silver purchased from American mining companies. = Idea and attempted legislation = It is uncertain who originated the idea for a US coin to commemorate the peace following World War I; the genesis is usually traced to an article by Frank Duffield published in the November 1918 issue of The Numismatist. Duffield suggested that a victory coin should be \\"issued in such quantities it will never become rare\\". In August 1920, a paper by numismatist Farran Zerbe was read to that year's American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention in Chicago. In the paper, entitled Commemorate the Peace with a Coin for Circulation, Zerbe called for the issuance of a coin to celebrate peace, stating, Numismatist Farran Zerbe's paper to the 1920 ANA convention caused the Association to advocate for a peace coin.Zerbe's proposal led to the appointment of a committee to transmit the proposal to Congress and urge its adoption. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, \\"Apparently, this was the first time that a coin collector ever wielded enough political clout to influence not only the Bureau of the Mint, but Congress as well.\\" The committee included noted coin collector and Congressman William A. Ashbrook (Democrat‚ÄìOhio), who had chaired the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures until the Republicans gained control following the 1918 elections. Ashbrook was defeated for re-election in the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not end until March 4 of the following year. He was friendly with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republican‚ÄìIndiana), and persuaded him to schedule a hearing on the peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as the redesign involved no expense. On May 9, 1921, striking of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint under the recoinage called for by the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. When Congress returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent that the bill pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, former Republican leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured that the bill would not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA and told them that he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921. = Competition = Sometime after the December 1920 hearing requested by the ANA, the chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it would be appropriate to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, under the auspices of the Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action. By November, proponents of the peace coin had realized that congressional approval was not necessary‚Äîas the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for the melted coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany‚Äîa declaration needed because the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington Conference on disarmament, for which the administration had great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules and requirements four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, all of whom had designed previous U.S. coins. The artists were instructed to depict the head of Liberty on the obverse, to be made \\"as beautiful and full of character as possible\\". The reverse would depict an eagle, as prescribed by the Coinage Act of 1792, but otherwise was left to the discretion of the artist. The piece also had to bear the denomination, the name of the country, \\"E pluribus unum\\", the motto \\"In God We Trust\\", and the word \\"Liberty\\". On December 13, the commission assembled to review the submitted designs, as well as a set produced by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan at Baker's request, and a set, unrequested, from a Mr. Folio of New York City. It is not known how the designs were displayed for the Commission. After considerable discussion among Fraser, Moore, and Herbert Adams (a sculptor and former member of the Commission), a design by Anthony de Francisci was unanimously selected. = Design = Teresa de Francisci, posing here for a 1922 newspaper photograph, served as the model for the Peace dollar. At age 34, de Francisci was the youngest of the competitors; he was also among the least experienced in the realm of coin design. While most of the others had designed regular or commemorative coins for the Mint, de Francisci's sole effort had been the conversion of drawings for the 1920 Maine commemorative half dollar to the finished design. De Francisci had had little discretion in that project, and later said of the work, \\"I do not consider it very favorably.\\" The sculptor based the obverse design of Liberty on the features of his wife, Teresa de Francisci. Due to the short length of the competition, he lacked the time to hire a model with the features he envisioned. Teresa de Francisci was born Teresa Cafarelli in Naples, Italy. In interviews, she related that when she was five years old and the steamer on which she and her family were immigrating passed the Statue of Liberty, she was fascinated by the statue, called her family over, and struck a pose in imitation. She later wrote to her brother Rocco, Breen wrote that the radiate crown that the Liberty head bears is not dissimilar to those on certain Roman coins, but is \\"more explicitly intended to recall that on the Statue of Liberty\\". Anthony de Francisci recalled that he opened the window of the studio and let the wind blow on his wife's hair as he worked. However, he did not feel that the design depicted her exclusively. He noted that \\"the nose, the fullness of the mouth are much like my wife's, although the whole face has been elongated\\". De Francisci submitted two reverse designs; one showed a warlike eagle, aggressively breaking a sword; the other an eagle at rest, holding an olive branch. The latter design, which would form the basis for the reverse of the Peace dollar, recalled de Francisci's failed entry for the Verdun City medal. The submitted obverse is almost identical to the coin as struck, excepting certain details of the face, and that the submitted design used Roman rather than Arabic numerals for the date. Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who hoped to start Peace dollar production in 1921, outlined the tight schedule for this to be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so. = Controversy = Sculptor Anthony de Francisci (left) and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker (right) inspecting a plaster model of the new silver dollar The Treasury announced the new design on December 19, 1921. Photographs of Baker and de Francisci examining the final plaster model appeared in newspapers, along with written descriptions of the designs, since the Treasury at that time took the position that it was illegal for photographs of a United States coin to be printed in a newspaper. Secretary Mellon gave formal approval to the design on December 20. As it would take the Mint several days to produce working dies, the first strike of the new coins was scheduled for December 29. The new design was widely reported in newspapers, and was the source of intense public attention. A Mint press release described the reverse as \\"a large figure of an eagle perched on a broken sword, and clutching an olive branch bearing the word, 'peace. On December 21, the New York Herald ran a scathing editorial against the new design, At the time, according to Burdette, given the traumas of the Great War, Americans were highly sensitive about their national symbols, and unwilling to allow artists any leeway in interpretation. The Mint, the Treasury, and the Fine Arts Commission began to receive large numbers of letters from the public objecting to the design. De Francisci attempted to defend his design, stating, \\"with the sword there is the olive branch of peace and the combination of the two renders it impossible to conceive of the sword as a symbolization of defeat\\". Baker had left Washington to visit the San Francisco Mint, a transcontinental journey of three days. Acting Mint Director Mary Margaret O'Reilly sent him a telegram on December 23, urgently seeking his approval to remove the sword from the reverse, as had been recommended by Moore and Fraser at a meeting the previous afternoon. Due to the tight timeline for 1921 strikings of the dollar, it was not possible to await Baker's response, so on the authority of Treasury Undersecretary Seymour Parker Gilbert, who was approached by O'Reilly, the Mint proceeded with the redesign. To satisfy Harding's executive order, the Fine Arts Commission quickly approved the change, and by the time Baker wired his approval on December 24, without being able to see the revisions, Gilbert had already approved the revised design in Secretary Mellon's absence. A press release was issued late on December 24, stating that the broken sword which had appeared on de Francisci's alternate reverse would not appear on the issued coin. In its December 25 edition, the Herald took full credit for the deletion of the broken sword from the coin's design. Farran Zerbe, whose paper to the ANA convention helped launch the dollar proposal, saw de Francisci's defense and the press release, and suggested that the sculptor had mistakenly thought his alternate design had been approved.  Production  = Initial release = The removal of the sword from the coinage hub, which had already been produced by reduction from the plaster models, was accomplished by painstaking work by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan, using extremely fine engraving tools under magnification. Morgan did the work on December 23 in the presence of de Francisci, who had been summoned to the Philadelphia Mint to ensure the work met with his approval. It was insufficient merely to remove the sword, as the rest of the design had to be adjusted. Morgan had to hide the excision; he did so by extending the olive branch, previously half-hidden by the sword, but had to remove a small length of stem that showed to the left of the eagle's talons. Morgan also strengthened the rays, and sharpened the appearance of the eagle's leg. The chief engraver did his work with such skill that the work on the dollar was not known for over 85 years. On December 28, Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Freas Styer wired Baker in San Francisco, reporting the first striking of the Peace dollar. The Mint later reported that 1,006,473 pieces were struck in 1921, a rate of output for the four days remaining in the year that Burdette calls \\"amazing\\"; he speculates that minting of 1921 Peace dollars continued into 1922. The first coin struck was to be sent to President Harding, but what became of it is something of a mystery: O'Reilly indicated that she had the coin sent to Harding, but the inventory of Harding's estate, prepared after the President died in office less than two years later, does not mention it, nor is there any mention of the coin in Harding's papers. Breen, in his earlier book on U.S. coins, stated that the coin was delivered to Harding by messenger on January 3, 1922, but does not state the source of his information. A few proofs of the 1921 production were struck early in the run, in both satin and matte finishes, but it is unknown exactly how many with either finish were created; numismatic historians Leroy Van Allen and A. George Mallis estimate the mintage totals at 24 of the former and five of the latter. The Peace dollar was released into circulation on January 3, 1922. In common with all silver and copper-nickel dollar coins struck from 1840 to 1978, the Peace dollar had a diameter of , which was larger than the Mint's subsequently struck modern dollar coins. Its issuance completed the redesign of United States coinage that had begun with issues in 1907. Long lines formed at the Sub-Treasury Building in New York the following day when that city's Federal Reserve Bank received a shipment; the 75,000 coins initially sent by the Mint were \\"practically exhausted\\" by the end of the day. Rumors that the coins did not stack well were contradicted by bank cashiers, who demonstrated for The New York Times that the coins stacked about as well as the Morgan dollars. De Francisci had paid Morgan for 50 of the new dollars; on January 3, Morgan sent him the pieces. According to his wife, de Francisci had bet several people that he would lose the design competition; he used the pieces to pay off the bets and did not keep any. According to one Philadelphia newspaper, = Modification and production = From the start, the Mint found that excessive pressure had to be applied to fully bring out the design of the coin, and the dies broke rapidly. On January 10, 1922, O'Reilly, still serving as Acting Mint Director in Baker's absence, ordered production of the dollar stopped. Dies had been sent to the Denver and San Francisco mints in anticipation of beginning coinage there; they were ordered not to begin work until the difficulties had been resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts was asked to advise what changes might solve the problems. Both Fraser and de Francisci were called to Philadelphia, and after repeated attempts to solve the problem without reducing the relief failed, de Francisci agreed to modify his design to reduce the relief. The plaster models he prepared were reduced to coin size using the Mint's Janvier reducing lathe. However, even after 15 years of possessing the pantograph-like device, the Mint had no expert in its use on its staff, and, according to Burdette, \\"[h]ad a technician from Tiffany's or Medallic Art [Company] been called in, the 1922 low relief coins might have turned out noticeably better than they did\\". Approximately 32,400 coins on which Morgan had tried to keep a higher relief were struck in January 1922. While all were believed to have been melted, one circulated example has surfaced. Also, high relief 1922 proof dollars occasionally appear on the market and it is believed that about six to 10 of them exist.1922 Peace Dollar The new low-relief coins, which Fraser accepted on behalf of the Commission, though under protest, were given limited production runs in Philadelphia in early February. When the results proved satisfactory, San Francisco began striking its first Peace dollars using the low-relief design on February 13, with Denver initiating production on February 21, and Philadelphia on February 23. The three mints together struck over 84 million pieces in 1922. The 1926 Peace dollar, from all mints, has on the obverse the word \\"God\\", slightly boldened. The Peace dollar's lettering tended to strike indistinctly, and Burdette suggests that the new chief engraver, John R. Sinnock (who succeeded Morgan after his death in 1925), may have begun work in the middle of the motto \\"In God We Trust\\", and for reasons unknown, only the one word was boldened. No Mint records mention the matter, which was not discovered until 1999. The Peace dollar circulated mainly in the Western United States, where coins were preferred over paper money, and saw little circulation elsewhere. Aside from this use, the coins were retained in vaults as part of bank reserves. They would frequently be obtained from banks as Christmas presents, with most deposited again in January. With the last of the Pittman Act silver struck into coins in 1928, the Mint ceased the production of Peace dollars. Production of Peace dollars resumed in 1934, due to another congressional act; this one requiring the Mint to purchase large quantities of domestic silver, a commodity whose price was at a historic low. This Act assured producers of a ready market for their product, with the Mint gaining a large profit in seigniorage, through monetizing cheaply purchased silver‚Äîthe Mint in fact paid for some shipments of silver bullion in silver dollars. Pursuant to this authorization, over seven million silver Peace dollars were struck in 1934 and 1935. Mint officials gave consideration to striking 1936 silver dollars, and in fact prepared working dies, but as there was no commercial demand for them, none were actually struck. With Mint Chief Engraver Sinnock thinking it unlikely that there would be future demand for the denomination, the master dies were ordered destroyed in January 1937.  Striking of 1964-D Peace dollars  An unofficially produced 1964-D Peace dollar, struck over a genuine silver dollar by a private mint On August 3, 1964, Congress passed legislation providing for the striking of 45,000,000 silver dollars. Silver coins, including the dollar, had become scarce due to hoarding as the price of silver rose past the point at which a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as currency. The new coins were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where \\"hard money\\" was popular. Many in the numismatic press complained that the new silver dollars would only satisfy a small special interest, and would do nothing to alleviate the general coin shortage. Much of the pressure for the coins to be struck was being applied by the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield (Democrat‚ÄìMontana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars. Preparations for the striking proceeded at a reluctant Mint Bureau. Some working dies had survived Sinnock's 1937 destruction order, but were found to be in poor condition, and Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) Frank Gasparro was authorized to produce new ones. Mint officials had also considered using the Morgan Dollar design; this idea was dropped and Gasparro replicated the Peace dollar dies. The reverse dies all bore Denver mintmarks; as the coins were slated for circulation in the West, it was deemed logical to strike them nearby. Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon was opposed to restriking the Peace dollar and in early 1965 informed President Lyndon Johnson that such coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana, nor anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, they would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams was also against striking the silver dollars, but hoped to keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar‚Äîthe Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965. The new pieces were publicly announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring that they would not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams suddenly announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 dollars had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands. in 1970, two unknown specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault and were ordered destroyed. Rumors and speculation about others surviving in illegal private possession immediately began and continue to appear from time to time.1964-D Peace Dollars - Do They Really Exist? Pieces appearing to be 1964-D dollars have also been privately restruck using unofficial dies and genuine, earlier-date Peace dollars. Some Peace dollars using an experimental base metal composition were struck in 1970 in anticipation of the approval of the Eisenhower dollar; they are all presumed destroyed. This new dollar coin was approved by an act signed by President Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970, with the obverse to depict President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died in March, 1969. Circulating Eisenhower dollars contained no precious metal, though some for collectors were struck in 40% silver.  Mintage figures  None of the Peace dollar mintages are particularly rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for little more than the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low- mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.

It was the first standard silver dollar minted since the passage of the Coinage Act of 1873, which ended the free coining of silver and the production of the previous design, the Seated Liberty dollar. The coin is named after its designer, United States Mint Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan. The obverse depicts a profile portrait representing Liberty, while the reverse depicts an eagle with wings outstretched. The mint mark, if present, appears on the reverse above the \\"o\\" in \\"Dollar\\". The dollar was authorized by the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act. Following the passage of the 1873 act, mining interests lobbied to restore free silver, which would require the Mint to accept all silver presented to it and return it, struck into coin. Instead, the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act was passed, which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver at market value to be coined into dollars each month. In 1890, the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act was repealed by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the Treasury to purchase of silver each month, but only required further silver dollar production for one year. This act, once again, was repealed in 1893. In 1898, Congress approved a bill that required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars. When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904, the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar. The Pittman Act, passed in 1918, authorized the melting and recoining of millions of silver dollars. Pursuant to the act, Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921. The design was replaced by the Peace dollar later the same year. In the early 1960s, a large quantity of uncirculated Morgan dollars in their original bags were discovered in the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value and then removed them from circulation through hoarding, and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.  Background  In 1873, Congress enacted the Fourth Coinage Act, which effectively ended the bimetallic standard in the United States by demonetizing silver bullion. Prior to enactment of the Coinage Act, silver could be brought to the mints and coined into legal tender for a small fee. With such a system in place, bullion producers could have silver coined into dollars when the intrinsic value of a silver dollar was lower than the face value, thus making a profit, flooding the money supply and causing inflation. The act ended production of the standard silver dollar (then the Seated Liberty dollar, as designed by Christian Gobrecht) and provided for mintage of a silver trade dollar, which was intended to compete with Mexican dollars for use in the Orient. Under the act, bullion producers were allowed to bring bullion to the mints in order to be cast into bars or coined into the newly authorized trade dollars for a small fee. Trade dollars initially held legal tender status, but it was revoked in 1876 to prevent bullion producers from making a profit by coining silver into trade dollars when the value of the metal was low. The restrictions on free coinage laid out in the Coinage Act initially met little resistance from mining interests until the price of silver declined rapidly due to increased mining in the Western United States. Protests also came from bankers, manufacturers and farmers, who felt an increased money supply would have a positive impact. Groups were formed that demanded the free coinage of silver (or \\"free silver\\") in order to inflate the dollar following the Panic of 1873. Beginning in 1876, several bills were introduced in the House of Representatives in an effort to resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates for the first time in United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.  Design history  Anna Willess Williams, as depicted in an 1892 issue of Ladies' Home Journal In 1876, Director of the Mint Henry Linderman began efforts to redesign the nation's silver coins. Linderman contacted C.W. Fremantle, Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in London, requesting him to \\"find a first class die-sinker who would be willing to take the position of Assistant Engraver at the Mint at Philadelphia.\\" In response to Linderman's request, Fremantle wrote \\"My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver lead me very strongly to recommend for the post Mr. George Morgan, age 30, who has made himself a considerable name, but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country.\\" An agreement was reached between Linderman and Morgan for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver William Barber on a six-month trial basis. Morgan arrived in Philadelphia on October 9, 1876. His earliest pattern coins designed during his tenure at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar. In 1876, Morgan enrolled as a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare to create a new Liberty head design. Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design. For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek‚Äìstyle figures. Morgan's friend, artist Thomas Eakins, suggested he use Anna Willess Williams of Philadelphia as a model. In total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen. On October 18, 1877, Linderman requested Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint James Pollock to \\"instruct Mr. Morgan to prepare without delay, dies for a silver dollar, the designs, inscriptions, and arrangement thereof to be the same as the enclosed impression for the Half Dollar and numbered '2' substituting the words 'one dollar' in place of 'half dollar'\\". Linderman also ordered Pollock to \\"instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die for a dollar with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law. He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same.\\" Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver; he wrote Pollock on February 21, 1878, \\"I have now to state for your information, that it is my intention, in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress, becoming law, to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan.\\"  Production  Morgan's design, struck as a half dollar pattern in 1877 1881 Morgan Dollar Reverse A coinage press at the Philadelphia Mint Production of the coins did not commence until March 11, more than a week after the passage of the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act. The first acceptable strike, after adjustments to the press, was coined at 3:17 p.m. at the Philadelphia Mint. This piece was given to President Hayes; the second and third were given to Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman and Mint Director Henry Linderman. Linderman desired to involve the western mints of San Francisco and Carson City in production in order to help reach the monthly quota necessary under the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act. Pressure was so great at the Philadelphia Mint that it halted production of all other coins and began operating overtime. Use of the western mints was delayed, however, as all dies were prepared at the Philadelphia Mint, and it was believed that the Western mints did not have the proper equipment to prepare the dies for use. During the second week of production, Linderman pointed out what he called a \\"slight imperfection\\" in the dies for the dollar. The reason for the changes was to reduce the relief of the designs and to change the number of tail feathers on the eagle from eight to seven; this was done because all prior United States coinage depicted the bald eagle as having an odd number of tail feathers. The high relief had caused the dies to have a shorter life. Dies were eventually sent to the Western mints, arriving in both San Francisco and Carson City on April 16, 1878. The New Orleans Mint began striking the new silver dollars in 1879. The Denver Mint, established in 1906, struck the coins for only one year, in 1921. The mint marks appearing on the coins are none, representing Philadelphia, \\"CC\\" for Carson City, \\"S\\" for San Francisco, \\"O\\" for New Orleans and \\"D\\" for Denver. In order to conform to the Coinage Act of 1837, the Morgan dollar contained ninety percent silver and ten percent copper, measured in diameter and weighed .  Sherman Silver Purchase Act, Panic of 1893  Ohio senator John Sherman authored the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, forcing the Treasury to purchase each month. Mintage of the Morgan dollar remained relatively steady until the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act on July 14, 1890. The act, authored by Ohio senator and former Treasury secretary John Sherman, forced the Treasury to increase the amount of silver purchased to each month. Supporters of the act believed that an increase in the amount of silver purchased would result in inflation, helping to relieve the nation's farmers. The act also received support from mining interests because such large purchases would cause the price of silver to rise and increase their profits. Despite the Act's requiring large purchases of silver indefinitely, it provided that the Mint must coin 2,000,000 silver dollars each month only until 1891. Since the Treasury already had a surplus of silver dollars, minting of dollars dropped sharply beginning in 1892. The silver that remained after mintage of the dollars was used to mint dimes, quarters and half dollars. Beginning early in 1893, a number of industrial firms, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National Cordage Company went bankrupt. The resulting bank runs and failures became known as the Panic of 1893. In June of that year, President Grover Cleveland, who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it. The act was repealed on November 1, 1893. On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars. Silver dollar production rose again, until the bullion was exhausted in 1904, when it ceased.  Pittman Act  Senator Key Pittman was responsible for the act that called for the melting of up to 350,000,000 silver dollars. The German government began a propaganda campaign during World War I to discredit the United Kingdom's currency in India. The Germans convinced Indian citizens that British banknotes in that country could not be redeemed for silver. This led to a run on the British supply of silver. In response, United States Democratic senator Key Pittman of Nevada introduced legislation in 1918 that was intended to offer financial relief to the British government. The bill, passed on April 22, 1918, stated that \\"sales of silver bullion under authority of this act may be made for the purpose of conserving the existing stock of gold in the United States, of providing silver for subsidiary coinage and for commercial use, and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States\\". The Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to melt up to 350,000,000 silver dollars, and this commenced immediately after the Act's passage. The U.S. eventually melted a total of 270,232,722 silver dollars. Of that amount, 259,121,554 were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per troy ounce. The U.S. only minted the Morgan dollar again during 1921, the only year in which Morgan dollars were struck at the Denver mint. Since the Treasury had destroyed the obsolete Morgan dollar dies in 1910, Morgan had to create an entirely new master die. Another provision of the Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to mint a replacement coin for every silver dollar melted. During the same year, the Peace dollar was first issued to commemorate the end of World War I. The Peace dollar was supposedly minted to replace the Morgan dollar under the terms of the Pittman Act but without congressional authorization, despite the fact that the Act did not describe the coin design. The change in design was actually authorized under an 1890 act of Congress, which stated:  Carson City Mint Morgan dollars  Until 1964, U.S. citizens could redeem paper money known as silver certificates for silver dollars at a U.S. Treasury mint on demand. In 1962, an individual redeemed a silver certificate and received a rare and valuable Morgan dollar in exchange. The coin was from a bag of silver dollars in the vault of the Philadelphia Mint. This incident triggered huge interest, and between November 1962 and March 1964, millions of Morgan and Peace dollars were sold to the general public. The demand to exchange silver certificates for silver dollars was so great that lines formed outside of the Treasury Building in Washington, D.C. Some people in line were pushing wheelbarrows. The U.S. Treasury discovered previously unknown mint bags of Carson City dollars in its vaults containing slightly more than 2.8 million Carson City silver dollars in the Treasury vaults. Treasury officials decided to hold them back because the total number of coins minted at the Carson City mint were generally lower than others. On May 12, 1969, the Joint Commission on Coinage held a meeting in order to determine the best way to sell the Carson City-minted dollars earlier held back by Treasury officials. They recommended a mail bid sale. Legislation was passed on December 31, 1970 directing the Treasury to transfer the silver dollars to the Administrator of General Services who was given the responsibility for marketing and selling the coins. The legislation also stated that all proceeds from the sale were to be \\"covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.\\" Congress supplied the General Services Administration with $10 million to market the dollar coins. Advertising consisted of posters and brochures distributed to post offices, banks and various financial institutions, as well as television documentaries. The coins were sorted and mounted in small plastic display cases. The GSA conducted a total of seven mail bid sales between 1972 and 1980. In total, the sales generated $107 million in revenue.  San Francisco commemorative dollar  2006 commemorative silver dollar, bearing Morgan's reverse design with modifications On June 15, 2006, legislation was approved that provided for the minting of a silver dollar and a five dollar gold coin in \\"commemoration of the Old Mint at San Francisco,\\" with surcharges to be given to the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society in an effort to rehabilitate the Old Mint. In total, 100,000 gold and 500,000 silver commemorative coins were authorized. Authorization came at the behest of several hobby publications, who enlisted readers to contact their local congressmen and persuade them to pass necessary legislation. The designs approved for the silver dollar bear a left-frontal view of the Old Mint building and a copy of Morgan's eagle design on the obverse and reverse, respectively. Mint artist Joseph Menna made a new model for the reverse, employing a 1904 San Francisco-minted dollar as his model.  2021 Morgan and Peace Dollars  On September 22, 2020 the House passed proposed legislation which would mint Morgan and Peace Dollar coins on the 100 year anniversary of the transition from the Morgan to Peace dollar to \\"commemorate this significant evolution of American Freedom\\". Bill H.R. 6192 (2021 Silver Dollar Coin Anniversary Act) produces Morgan and Silver dollars at 26.73g and no less than 90 percent silver.

The law was used to prosecute people engaging in oral and anal sex along with homosexual activity. It has also been used to criminalize third gender people, such as the apwint in Malaysia. It remains in force in many former colonies, while others have repealed it.  History  Although Section 377 did not explicitly include the word homosexual, it has been used to prosecute homosexual activity. The provision was introduced by authorities in the Raj in 1860 as Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and functioned as the legal impetus behind the criminalization of what was referred to as, \\"unnatural offenses\\" throughout the various colonies, in several cases with the same section number. Although most colonies have since gained independence through statehood since Section 377 was implemented, it remains in the penal codes of Malaysia, Singapore (see Section 377A of the Penal Code of Singapore), Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Jamaica.

Repeal efforts  In 2018, after decades of grassroots activism, the application of section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to private consensual sex between men was ruled unconstitutional by India's Supreme Court, effectively decriminalizing private homosexual activity.

As a manager, he was at the helm of clubs Sheffield Wednesday, Everton, Queens Park Rangers and Arsenal. Career Burtenshaw started off his playing days in 1952 featuring as a wing half for Brighton & Hove Albion. At Albion, he won the Third Division (South) title in 1957-58. He lifted the Fourth Division title in 1964-65 with the Seagulls. Altogether he was capped 237 times within the Football League by Brighton & Hove. After his playing days came to an end Burtenshaw became a coach at Brighton. Amongst the players he took under his wing was Howard Wilkinson, the future First Division winning manager of Leeds United. Burtenshaw joined Arsenal as a coach in 1971, succeeding Don Howe after his departure to West Bromwich Albion. Burtenshaw stayed for two years before resigning, despite the club reaching an FA Cup final and coming second in the First Division. Soon after, he moved to Sheffield Wednesday and spent two years there as manager. He later became a coach at Everton, managing the side in a caretaker capacity for three games in January 1977 after the club sacked Billy Bingham. He also went on to be at the helm of club Queens Park Rangers from 1978 to 1979. Burtenshaw later returned to Arsenal as a coach and scout, and was caretaker manager of the club between March and May 1986, after the resignation of Don Howe as manager; Arsenal finished seventh in the First Division that season. He returned to his coaching role after the club appointed George Graham that summer. Burtenshaw's time at the club was overshadowed when he admitted taking \\"bungs\\" for signing John Jensen, in the scandal that led to Graham's sacking as Arsenal manager. He was fined ¬£7,500 with ¬£2,500 costs by the Football Association. After leaving Arsenal along with Bruce Rioch in 1996, Burtenshaw became chief scout under Stewart Houston at Queens Park Rangers. Despite suffering a stroke in 2001 he later joined Kevin Keegan as scout at Manchester City, before retiring from football altogether.

Its ingredients vary considerably, depending on whether it is the \\"Northern\\" (primarily Pennsylvanian) or \\"Southern\\" variety, as well as separate (and likely the original) Canadian variety, prevalent in the Maritimes. The former is made from a combination of vegetables, mainly green and red tomatoes, onions, carrots, beans of various types, asparagus, cauliflower and peas. The latter is entirely or almost entirely cabbage. These ingredients are pickled in a canning jar. After preserving, chow-chow is served cold, often as a condiment or relish. The origin of the term \\"chow- chow\\" is obscure. The term \\"chow-chow\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"piccalilli\\" (an English version of Indian-style pickles). Some believe that chow-chow found its way to the southern United States during the expulsion of the Acadian people from Nova Scotia and their settlement in Louisiana. It is eaten by itself or as a condiment on fish cakes, mashed potatoes, biscuits and gravy, pinto beans, hot dogs, hamburgers and other foods. Others cite a connection to relish recipes of Chinese rail workers in the 1800s and Indian chutneys.The Mountain Laurel, \\"Southern Sweet Chow-Chow Relish\\" It has also been suggested that the name \\"chow-chow\\" is rooted in the French word chou for cabbage.

Fyodorov advocated radical life extension, physical immortality and even resurrection of the dead, using scientific methods.  Early life and education Fyodorov's parents were the (noble) Pavel Ivanovich Gagarin and Elisaveta Ivanova, a woman of lower-class nobility. He studied at the Richelieu Lyceum in Odessa. From 1854 to 1868, he served as a teacher in various small Russian towns. In 1878, he joined the Rumyantsev Museum staff as a librarian. Fyodorov opposed the idea of property of books and ideas and never published anything during his lifetime. His selected articles were printed posthumously with the title Philosophy of the Common Task (also known as Philosophy of Physical Resurrection).  Philosophy  Fyodorov was a futurist, who theorized about the eventual perfection of the human race and society (i.e., utopia), including radical ideas like immortality, revival of the dead, space and ocean colonization. His writings greatly influenced mystic Peter Uspensky. He also had direct contact with early rocket theorist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who visited the library where he worked over a 3-year period. He was also known to Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. =Fyodorov and Tolstoy= Leo Tolstoy was of the highest opinion of Fyodorov. They were quite friendly, and shared many ideas in the 1880s and early 90s. But Fyodorov refused to see Tolstoy again after 1892, because of their ideological differences. That was the time of some food shortages in Russia because of poor harvest. Tolstoy published in the London Daily Telegraph an article accusing the Russian government of not doing enough for the peasants, which displeased many Russian conservatives. While Fyodorov shared with Tolstoy many religious ideas, he was also a church-going Christian who cared very much for the Orthodox ritual observance. This was also a big stumbling block between them. = Humankind‚Äôs Common Cause = Fyodorov argued that evolutionary process was directed towards increased intelligence and its role in the development of life. Humanity is the culmination of evolution, as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fyodorov also argued that mortality is the most obvious indicator of the still imperfect, contradictory nature of humanity and the underlying reason for most evil and nihilism of humankind. Fyodorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people of Earth, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth (he called this the Common Cause). Fyodorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving immortality and revival is the greatest goal of science, and that this knowledge must leave the laboratories and become the common property of all: \\"Everyone must be learning and everything be the subject of knowledge and action\\". = Two reasons for death = Human life, emphasized Fyodorov, dies for two reasons. First is internal: due to the material organization of a human, his or her functionality is incapable of infinite self-renewal. To overcome this, psychophysiological regulation of human organisms is needed. The second reason is the unpredictable nature of the external environment; its destructive character must be overcome with the regulation of Nature. Regulation of nature, \\"introducing will and reason into nature\\" includes, according to Fyodorov, prevention of natural disasters, control of Earth's climate, fight against viruses and epidemics, mastery of solar power, space exploration and unlimited creative work there. = Immortality for all = Achieving immortality and resurrection of all people who ever lived are two inseparable goals, according to Fyodorov. Immortality is impossible, both ethically and physically, without resurrection. We cannot allow our ancestors, who gave us life and culture, to remain buried, or our relatives and friends to die. Achieving immortality for individuals alive today and future generations is only a partial victory over death ‚Äì only the first stage. The complete victory will be achieved only when everyone is resurrected and transformed to enjoy immortal life. = Restoring life and making it infinite = Fyodorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research of the possibility of restoring life and making it infinite. His first project involved collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on \\"knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world\\". This idea of Fyodorov is related to the modern practice of cloning. The second method described by Fyodorov is genetic-hereditary. The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a genetic twin of the dead person (the problem of identity in cloning). It is necessary to give back the revived person his old mind, his personality. Fyodorov speculates about the idea of \\"radial images\\" that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fyodorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, humanity will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation. = Transformation of past physical forms = The revival of people who lived during the past is not a recreation of their past physical form ‚Äì it was imperfect, parasitic, centered on mortal existence. Fyodorov's idea was to transform it into self-creating, mind-controlled form, capable of infinite renewal, which is immortal. Those who haven‚Äôt died will go through the same transformation. Humans will have to become creators and organizers of their organisms (\\"our body will be our business\\"). In the past the development of civilization happened by increasing human power using external tools and machines ‚Äì the human body remained imperfect. = Transhumanism = Fyodorov stated that people needed to reconcile the difference between the power of technology and weakness of the human physical form. The transition is overdue from purely technical development, a \\"prosthetic\\" civilization, to organic progress, when not just external tools, artificial implements, but the organisms themselves are improved, so that, for example, a person can fly, see far and deep, travel through space, live in any environment. People must become capable of \\"organodevelopment\\" that so far only nature was capable of. Fyodorov discussed supremacy of mind, \\"giving, developing organs for itself\\" and anticipated V. Vernadsky‚Äôs idea of autotrophic humans. He argues that a person must become an autotrophic, self-feeding creature, acquire a new mode of energy exchange with the environment that will not end. Fyodorov repeatedly said that only general scientific studies of aging, death and postmortem studies can deliver the means to overcome death and promote indefinite healthy lifespan.  Popular culture  Nikolai Fyodorov monument at Borovsk, Kaluga Oblast The 2011 BBC documentary Knocking on Heaven's Door, about the Space Race in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, suggests that, in many people's eyes, Nikolai Fyodorov was the true father of the Soviet space project that put the first man in space. Fyodorov's thought is extensively though indirectly discussed and alluded to in the well-regarded 2010 science fiction novel The Quantum Thief; it is implied that the founders of the post- human collective of uploaded minds called the Sobornost were inspired by Fyodorov and other thinkers associated with cosmism. The 2013 novel Strange Bodies by Marcel Theroux imagines Fyodorov's ideas of the Common Task being developed by Soviet and post-Soviet research to implant a mind into another body using an encoded lexicon from the original mind and an unspecified, but painful, procedure.

Gait, along with his twin brother Gary Gait, had outstanding playing careers at Syracuse University, in the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, the Western Lacrosse Association, and at the international level for Canada. College career Paul and his twin brother Gary played NCAA lacrosse at Syracuse University as midfielders, where they set numerous records from 1987 to 1990 and popularized innovative moves such as behind-the-back passing and scoring. One of the best NCAA players of all time, Paul helped lead Syracuse to three national championships and was selected as a First Team All-Americans by the USILA three times, in 1988, 1989, and 1990. Paul was also named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1989 NCAA Division I Lacrosse Championship Tournament. After defeating Loyola in the 1990 NCAA Division I lacrosse tournament finals, the NCAA determined that head coach Roy Simmons Jr's wife Nancy Simmons had improperly co-signed for a car loan for Paul Gait. Gait was ruled ineligible for postseason play, and Syracuse vacated their tournament records and title.Mike Preston, NCAA rules Syracuse must forfeit 1990 championship, Baltimore Sun, June 11, 1995, retrieved May 12, 2014. After college, he played with his brother for the storied amateur Mount Washington Lacrosse Club in the 1990s.Doug Brown, Washington 'Mounts' its title drive LACROSSE Club team to face Brine of Boston, Baltimore Sun, June 19, 1993, retrieved May 26, 2010. Professional career Paul and Gary have both starred at all levels of professional lacrosse, including the National Lacrosse League, the Western Lacrosse Association, Major League Lacrosse, and at the international level for the Canadian National Team. Paul was a 3-time winner of the Mann Cup MVP award. The twins were named Co-MVPs of the Mann Cup in 1999, when they played for the Victoria Shamrocks. Paul initially retired from play following the 2002 NLL season but then returned during the 2005 NLL season to play for the Colorado Mammoth with his brother. He played four games totaling nine points and then retired again after the 2005 season. Paul is sixth all time on the NLL points total list with 712 points in 13 seasons. In 2001 Paul was named the MLL playoff and championship game MVP, after leading the Long Island Lizards to their first MLL title, with a record setting 7 goal performance,(on 8 shots)in the MLL championship game. In 2002 Paul lead the NLL in goals and points and was name the league MVP. He retired due to the early onset osteoarthritis in his back, ankles and elbows. In 2005, both Gait brothers were inducted into the United States Lacrosse National Hall of Fame. The following year, in 2006, both brothers were among the five charter members to be voted into the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame. Paul, Gary and Jim Brown were also named to the NCAA all century team. In 1990, Paul represented STX Lacrosse as a Sales Representative. In 1994 Paul started GBLax, a lacrosse specialty retail business located in Syracuse NY. In 1996 Paul sold GBLAX and became an independent lacrosse equipment design/developer for J.deBeer & Son, where he developed a line of lacrosse equipment for the softball manufacturing company. He was hired full-time by deBeer in 1996 where he worked, in various roles until 2011, ultimately becoming the company president between 2003-2011. In his tenure at deBeer he was credited for developing the modern women's lacrosse head (Apex) and has revolutionized the women's lacrosse pocket. He also introduced the Gait Brand of men's lacrosse equipment in 2003. deBeer/Gait quickly became the world's leading producer of women's lacrosse equipment and Canadian box lacrosse gear. In 2011 Paul founded Team 22 Lacrosse(Guilderland, NY), the exclusive licensee for Under Armour lacrosse products. Currently Under Armour is one of the fastest growing lacrosse brands. Paul has 30 lacrosse related patents issued during his time in the business. Paul is also the founder of Laxpocket LLC, the country's leading producer of women's lacrosse pockets.

Richborough lies close to the Isle of Thanet. The population of the settlement is included in the civil parish of Ash. Although now some distance from the sea, Richborough stood at the southern end of the Wantsum Channel from prehistory to the early medieval period. The channel provided a safe searoute from the continent to the Thames estuary and separated the Isle of Thanet from the mainland. The channel has now silted up, but prior to this, Richborough was an important natural harbour and was the landing place of the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. Until October 2008 there was uncertainty whether this was the site of the Claudian invasion of Britain; two ditches at the site which have been dated to the Roman period were interpreted as defensive structures; however, some archaeologists had favoured the theory that the landing took place in the vicinity of modern-day Chichester. The 2008 discovery proved that this was a defensive site of a Roman beachhead, protecting 700 metres of coast. The suffragan bishop of Richborough, in the Diocese of Canterbury, was created in 1995 to provide a second provincial episcopal visitor (after Ebbsfleet) for the Province of Canterbury. Roman and Saxon history The Romans founded the site and, after their withdrawal, the site was occupied by a Saxon religious settlement (since St Augustine landed in 597 at nearby Ebbsfleet). The site is managed by English Heritage who run historical events on the site throughout the summer. Secret Harbour of 1916 During the First World War the capacity of Dover and other nearby ports was found to be inadequate, and a major harbour was constructed at Richborough. Its purpose was to provide the British Expeditionary Force with its heavy equipment (tanks, guns, railway locomotives, ammunition, horses and fuel). In 1917, the British Government began to look into the possibility of installing a cross-Channel train ferry at Richborough to allow Roll-on/roll-off transportation of railway rolling stock, artillery and supplies to the allied Front Lines. This was the first time that sea-going Roll-on/roll-off ferries had been used from Britain. Three new train-ferries were built , and and operations began on 10 February 1918, conveying nearly 900 tons of cargo at a time between Richborough and Calais and Dunkirk. Although existing barge services were still in operation across the Channel from Richborough, the use of train-ferries was more practical for larger and heavier cargos, such as tanks. The use of train-ferries greatly reduced the amount of labour required in the transport of these items. It took only 30 to 40 minutes to load or unload the 54 railway wagons and fifty or sixty motor vehicles that could be carried by these train-ferries. An analysis done at the time found that to transport 1,000 tons of war material from the point of manufacture to the front by conventional means involved the use of 1,500 labourers, whereas when using train-ferries that number decreased to around 100 labourers. To accommodate the train-ferries, a new type of terminal had to be designed and built at Richbrough, Calais and Dunkirk. Adjustable steel bridges with two sets of railway lines, spanning between 80 and 100 feet depending on the local conditions at the each port, were installed at each of the three ports to allow a true connection between railway lines on shore and the tracks on the ferry. By mid-1918 it had become a very large site, occupying 2000 acres and capable of handling 20,000 tons of traffic each week. After the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918, train ferries were used extensively for the return of material from the Front. Indeed, according to war office statistics, a greater tonnage of material was transported by train ferry from Richborough in 1919 than in 1918. As the train ferries had space for motor transport as well as railway rolling stock, thousands of lorries, motor cars and \\"B Type\\" buses used these ferries to return to England. Richborough Power Station The Richborough Power Station was opened, within the port, in 1962 burning coal as its fuel. Then in 1971 it was converted to run on oil before it was finally converted again to burn the controversial fuel Orimulsion during the final years of operation. Orimulsion is an emulsion originating from the Orinoco Basin, which was offloaded here. The plant closed down in 1996, but much of it remained in situ until the demolition of the three cooling towers on 11 March 2012. A new Energy Park is planned for the site, including a Diesel Peak Generator.  Bibliography  * Bushe-Fox, J.

He is known for his novels Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty and his classic memoir of early commercial aviation Fate Is the Hunter, all of which were made into major motion pictures. Early life Gann was born in Lincoln, Nebraska to a prosperous Midwestern family; his father was an executive with General Telephone and Telegraph in Lincoln, Nebraska; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Chicago, Illinois. Rebelling against his father's strong desire that he seek a career with the telephone business, Ernest pursued several other interests as he matured. He was fascinated by topics including photography, movie-making, and aviation. As a young man, he showed little interest in school and performed poorly. His parents decided that he needed discipline and that he should attend a military school. He was sent to the Culver Military Academy (now Culver Academies) for his high school years. Despite many misadventures and struggles with the harsh academic environment and strict rules at Culver, he graduated at age 19 in 1930. He elected to pursue filmmaking, and matriculated with the Yale School of Drama. After his studies at Yale, Gann worked in New York City at Radio City Music Hall as a projectionist and later as a commercial movie cartoonist. On September 18, 1933, Gann married Eleanor Helen Michaud in Chicago, Illinois. They had three children: George Kellogg Gann, (November 12, 1935); Polly Wing Gann; and Steven Anthony Gann (March 4, 1941). A chance encounter gained Gann a job with The March of Time, a documentary movie series associated with Time magazine. While working on the feature Inside Nazi Germany in 1936, Gann narrowly escaped Hitler's troops as they marched into the Rhineland. Returning to New York, he relocated his family to a new home in Rockland County where the lure of a local airport, Christie Brothers in New City, New York, rekindled his interest with aviation. He purchased a half partnership in a Stinson Reliant (gullwing) aircraft with actor Burgess Meredith, obtained his pilot license, and soon became an accomplished aviator. Aviation career After earning his pilot certificate, Gann spent much of his free time aloft, flying for pleasure. The continuing Great Depression soon cost him his job and he was unable to find another job in the movie business. In search of work, he decided to relocate his family to California. He took odd jobs and flight instructed at Burbank and nearby airports and began to write short stories. A friend got him a part-time job as a co-pilot with a local airline and it was there that he flew his first trips as a professional aviator. During the late 1930s many airlines were hiring as many pilots as they could find; after learning of these opportunities, Gann moved his family back to New York where he was hired by American Airlines to fly Douglas DC-2 and Douglas DC-3 aircraft. For several years Gann flew routes in the northeast for American. During 1942, many U.S. airlines' pilots and aircraft were absorbed into the Air Transport Command of the United States Army Air Forces to assist with the war effort. Gann and many of his co-workers at American volunteered to join the group. He flew DC-3s, Douglas C-47s (military versions of the DC-3s), Douglas C-54s (military versions of Douglas DC-4s) and Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express transports (the cargo version of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber). His wartime flights took him across the North Atlantic to Europe, and thence to Africa, South America, India, and other exotic places. Some of his most harrowing experiences came while flying The Hump airlift across the Himalayas into China. During the years to come Gann's worldwide travels and various adventures would become the inspiration for many of his novels and screenplays. At the end of World War II, the Air Transport Command released the civilian pilots and aircraft to their airlines. Gann decided to quit American Airlines in search of new adventures. He was hired as a pilot with a new company called Matson Airlines, a venture of the Matson steamship line. He flew from the US west coast across the Pacific to Honolulu. This experience created ideas that were developed into one of his best-known works, The High and the Mighty. Matson ultimately ceased operations. After a few more short-lived flying jobs, Gann became discouraged with aviation and began writing as a full-time occupation. After flying During his tenure with Matson, Gann moved his family to the San Francisco area, and it was there that he began writing professionally. In his autobiography he describes cycles of \\"boom and bust\\" as he would earn seemingly vast sums of money for a book or an article, spend wildly, and then suffer for long periods with little or no income. He attempted other types of work, such as fishing, but always resumed writing. Gann began to dislike the difficult and tedious routine of family life, missing the adventures and freedoms of his previous career. His marriage began to suffer and Eleanor eventually decided to divorce Gann. She was afflicted with numerous health problems, including severe rheumatoid arthritis, and following several years of declining health, she died on December 23, 1966 at Pebble Beach, California. Gann would endure several more tragedies in his personal life, including the death of his eldest son in 1973; while working on an oil tanker in the Gulf of Alaska, George was swept overboard in a storm. The Mar is a 75 ft. wooden ketch built in Denmark in 1975 by world renowned American aviator, author, filmmaker, sailor, fisherman and conservationist, Ernest K. Gann. Gann had a lifelong love of sailing. He made many friends in the nautical community in and around San Francisco and, when money was scarce for him, tried a few different jobs, mainly in the commercial fishing industry. He owned several boats of various types and sizes during his lifetime. Eventually, after years of planning and preparations, Gann purchased a large metal sailboat in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, which he christened Albatross. Along with his family and a few friends he sailed the boat across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Panama Canal to San Francisco Bay. Albatross was overhauled and Gann then sailed it around the South Pacific Ocean. He later leased the ship to a movie company to be used as the major prop in a movie based upon his book Twilight for the Gods. Soon after the production ended, Albatross was sold and became a school vessel. It was later lost in the Gulf of Mexico. (Its sinking is the topic of a 1996 movie named White Squall.) As his family life deteriorated, Gann began spending time with a friend, Dodie Post,https://skihall.com/hall-of-famers/dodie-post-gann/ whom he later married. Both before and after they were married they were partners in adventure, travel, and later, environmental causes. In 1966 they purchased an ranch on San Juan Island in the state of Washington. This was the beginning of his next great passion, environmental conservation. For that purpose, they later donated the bulk of their ranch to the San Juan Preservation Trust. Gann converted a chicken coop near their ranch house into a writing office. After his death, the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) moved the entire coop and its furnishings, including the barber's chair Gann used at his desk, to the EAA Aviation Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where it is on public display. During the autumn of 1991, Gann again took to the skies to mark the 50th anniversary of his promotion to Captain for American Airlines; it would be his last flight. On December 19, 1991, Gann died in Friday Harbor, San Juan Island, Washington, at the age of 81 after suffering kidney problemsAir & Space/Smithsonian, Vol. 6, No. 6 (February/March 1992), p. 15 for some time. Literary career Gann described his writing methods as torturous; he would often literally chain himself to his desk until he finished a certain amount of text. He suffered long periods of writer's block, and frequently worried that he would run out of ideas. Despite his successful career, he continued to have strong feelings of self-doubt and often expressed surprise at the critical praise he received. Gann's major works include the novel The High and the Mighty and his aviation memoir Fate Is the Hunter (regarded by many as one of the best-ever books about aviation). Notes and short stories scribbled during long layovers on his journeys across the North Atlantic became the source for his first serious fiction novel, Island in the Sky (1944), which was inspired by an actual Arctic rescue mission. It became an immediate best- seller as did Blaze of Noon (1946), a story about early air mail operations. His comprehensive autobiography entitled A Hostage to Fortune was published in 1978. Although many of his 21 best-selling novels reveal Gann's devotion to aviation, others, including Twilight for the Gods, and Fiddler's Green display his love of the sea. His experiences as a fisherman, skipper and sailor, all contributed storylines and depth to his nautical fiction. He later wrote an autobiography of his sailing life named Song of the Sirens. Gann wrote, or adapted from his books, the stories and screenplays for several movies and television shows. For some of these productions he also served as a consultant and technical adviser during filming. Although it received positive reviews, Gann was displeased with the movie version of Fate Is the Hunter, and removed his name from the credits. (He later lamented that this decision cost him a \\"fortune\\" in royalties, as the movie played repeatedly on television for years afterward.) He wrote the story for the television miniseries Masada, based on The Antagonists, and the story for the 1980 Walt Disney movie, The Last Flight of Noah's Ark. Honors Gann was a member or honorary member of the Society of Flight Test Engineers, Order of Daedalions, Black Birds, OX-5 Aviation Pioneers, Secret Order of Quiet Birdmen, Colgate President's Club, Washington Athletic Club, Grey Eagles Club, 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Retired Eastern Pilots Association, and American Fighter Pilots Association. Washington Governor Gary Locke posthumously awarded the Medal of Merit (the state's highest honor) to Gann on July 9, 2003. A cafe in Friday Harbor, Washington is named \\"Ernie's Cafe\\" in his honor. Flying magazine ranked Gann thirty-fourth in its 2013 list of the 51 heroes of aviation.

It is one of two high schools in the Dubuque Community School District and enrolls around 1,800 students in grades 9‚Äì12. The school is named in honor of Stephen Hempstead, the second governor of Iowa, and it competes in class 4A of the Iowa High School Athletic Association as part of the Mississippi Valley Conference. The school's mascot is the Mustang. History After World War II, the population of Dubuque moved further out to the west. The children born during the post-war baby boom also were in their late teens at the time. The community found that Senior High School would no longer be enough to serve the needs of the community. In 1966, district employees were encouraged to offer their thoughts on the design of the new building. In the spring of 1967, a $6.7mio bond issue was approved to cover the costs of the building. The school opened in 1969. \\\\- Parts 1 and 2 - CITED: p. 6B (part 2) Classes for students were initially held at Senior High School. In the spring of 1970, students began receiving education at Hempstead for the first time. In 1970, there was no graduating class because there was no senior class that first year. In the 1990s and mid 2005, structural improvements and expansions were made to the buildings. Over the next several years the school district has formulated plans to completely remodel the school. Campus The building is a three- level structure with an open courtyard in the center of the school. The second level contains classrooms, an indoor pool, gyms, art, music, driver education, and FHACS (Family Health & Consumer Sciences) classrooms. The third level holds the administrative offices, library/media center, math, science, business classrooms, a physical fitness room, cafeteria/commons area, industrial technology, wood working, and automobile shops. The third level also features an auditorium complex. Hempstead features a 25-yard indoor swimming pool. The city recreation department also allows the general public to use the pool when school is not in session. There is also an auditorium were musicals, plays, and concerts are performed throughout the school year. Students In the 2007‚Äì2008 school year, HHS enrolled 1,824 students. Of those, 1,754 (96.2%) were White, 30 (1.6%) were Black, 21 (1.2%) were Asian, and 3 (.2%) were American Indian. 16 (.9%) students were Hispanic, and may be of any race. Additionally, 943 (51.7%) were male, and 881 (48.3%) were female. Extracurricular activities =Theatre= Hempstead had the distinction of being one of the first schools to perform a stage version of High School Musical, which was presented in January 2007. =Athletics= Hempstead competes in Class 4A, the largest classification in Iowa, and in the Mississippi Valley Conference in the following sports:  Girls  *Cross Country *Volleyball ** 2-time State Champions (1975, 2003) *Basketball *Track *Golf ** 1990 Class 3A State Champions *Soccer *Softball *Tennis *Bowling  Boys  *Cross Country *Football ** 1979 Class 4A State Champions *Basketball *Wrestling *Track *Golf *Soccer *Baseball ** 4-time State Champions (1974, 1978, 1983, 1984) *Tennis ** 1984 Class 2A State Champions *Bowling ** 2012 Class 2A State Champions Renovation In 2004, a renovation program began using proceeds from a one-cent sales tax approved by Dubuque County voters in December 2002.

In 1986, it had a population of 84,413 inhabitants, which grew to 106,804 residents by 2006, a more than average growth. Overview Qalyub is the commercial center for a significant agricultural region, and some records indicate that Qalyub has had a farmer's market, regularly, for close to one thousand years. The people of Qalyub have often proven to be self-reliant like in 1905 when they built their own 500-bed hospital with no help from the state. Years later, the community received money from USAID for the hospital and the school, however, as in many rural villages, the Ministry of Social Affairs angered residents for not doing enough for them. In 1982, the Basic Village Service Program (BVS), under the auspices of USAID, had twenty-five water projects slated for Qalyub. On February 13, 2005, Qalyub was the location of a politically significant strike over the benefits and the privatization of the Qalyub Spinning Company. Qalyub was the site of the Qalyoub train collision in August 2006.

Personal life Carrell was born February 13, 1787 in Washington County, Virginia. He married Martha George Peery. They had two children, Charles and George. Carrell was a minister of the Methodist Church. In addition to his ministerial and musical activities, Carrell served as county court clerk of Russell County, Virginia. He died October 28, 1854 and is buried in the Old Lebanon Cemetery (aka North Church Street Cemetery).

Warszawa: ≈öwiat KsiƒÖ≈ºki, 1997, str. 157. ‚Äì 3 June 2018), was a Polish musician and singer-songwriter, co-founder of bands Kryzys, Brygada Kryzys, Izrael and Armia. In May 2012, Brylewski's autobiography, titled \\"Kryzys w Babilonie\\" (\\"Crisis in Babylon\\"), was published by the Wydawnictwo Literackie publishing house. The book has 584 pages and is based on a conversation between Brylewski and Polish Playboy journalist Rafa≈Ç Ksiƒô≈ºyk. In the book, Brylewski answers numerous questions about his childhood, youth, music, and private life.  Early years  Brylewski's father Waldemar was born in Czelad≈∫, Zag≈Çƒôbie DƒÖbrowskie, while his mother Hanna is from Warsaw. The two met in the 1950s, while dancing for the famous ≈ölƒÖsk Song and Dance Ensemble. Robert was their only child, and the future musician, even though born in Warsaw, spent most of his childhood in a castle at Koszƒôcin, where all members of the ensemble lived. Brylewski returned to Warsaw with his mother in the early 1970s; his parents divorced when he was 13, and Robert admitted in the book that as a teenager, he had a lot of freedom, as his mother toured Poland, dancing and singing, and his father remained at Koszƒôcin. Brylewski attended Warsaw's renowned 11th High School, but did not graduate, because, as he claims, while still there, he decided not to pursue any career or go to college, but to become a musician. As a teenager, Brylewski played association football, was a member of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, and later on, became interested in rock music. In the early 1970s, his father spent some time in the United States, from where he brought several records. At that time, rock shows were frequently organized at Warsaw's Congress Hall, and Brylewski attended them, as well as Warsaw's Jazz Jamboree Festival. To avoid military service, which was obligatory in Communist Poland, he faked mental illness.  1978 ‚Äì 1982  In the late 1970s, Brylewski read an article in ≈ªycie Warszawy about British punk rock movement. Impressed by the music of The Clash, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks and other bands, he went to see the first punk rock concert in Poland, featuring The Raincoats (April 1, 1978, at Riviera Remont Student Culture Center in Warsaw). After the show, he decided to start his own band, together with students of a high school from Wilan√≥w, Kamil Stoor and Pawe≈Ç \\"Kelner\\" Rozwadowski. They named their band The Boors, and after Stoor had left Poland for Sweden, with a new lineup, the band was renamed into Kryzys (Crisis, May 1979). Due to the connections of band's manager, Jacek Olechowski (brother of Andrzej Olechowski), Kryzys toured Poland in 1979 ‚Äì 1981, with such bands, as Kombi, Turbo, Exodus, and singers, such as John Porter, and Izabela Trojanowska. Brylewski wrote music for Kryzys, while lyrics were authored by the band's drummer, Maciej \\"Magura\\" G√≥ralski. In 1981, they played at National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, together with D≈ºem, Perfect and Bank. Kryzys ceased to exist in July 1981, and in early August 1981, Brylewski knocked on the door of the flat of Tomasz \\"Frantz\\" Lipi≈Ñski (son of Eryk Lipi≈Ñski), whose own band, Tilt, had been dissolved at that time as well. During the first meeting, both musicians agreed to start a new band. Since manager Jacek Orzechowski insisted on keeping the word Kryzys, Lipi≈Ñski suggested adding the word Brygada, therefore Brygada Kryzys (Crisis Brigade) was born. The leaders of the band described its music as punkadelic, and first show took place in September 1981 at Riviera Remont Student Culture Center in Warsaw, together with Republika. The concert was recorded and illegally published in Great Britain, as Brygada Kryzys Live. In November 1981, Brygada Kryzys toured Poland together with a British band TV 21. During the tour, Brylewski was badly beaten in a restaurant at a hotel in Gda≈Ñsk. Then, in early December 1981, Brygada Kryzys went to Belgrade, to participate in the Days of Young Polish Culture. The bus with both Brygada Kryzys and Maanam was not allowed entry into Czechoslovakia at the border crossing in Cieszyn, so it had to return to Warsaw, from where Brygada Kryzys flew to Belgrade. As Brylewski said in his autobiography: \\"The spirit of Josip Broz Tito was still in the air, but they all sensed that after his death, the country would break into pieces. They welcomed us as stars, as a legend\\". (page 126). On December 20, 1981 (see Martial Law in Poland), Brylewski was beaten up by the Communist police. Unlike such bands, as Maanam, TSA, Republika or Lombard, Brygada Kryzys refused to play at government-sponsored shows. The band recorded its first album in February ‚Äì March 1982 (due to the color of the cover, it was called the Black Album or the Black Brygada), and in the summer of that year, the band left for the village of W√≥lki, near Lublin. The situation of the martial law, however, was not good, and in the autumn of 1982, Lipi≈Ñski decided to split from the band. Brygada Kryzys ceased to exist, as Brylewski later said in his autobiography: \\"I was expecting this to happen. I sensed that Tomek was feeling down, and I was not surprised. Nothing was happening with Brygada, I bore that situation better than Tomek, while it all frustrated him, he was older, he counted on something more. One day he just packed his guitar and said it was all over\\". (page 155).  1983 -1985  After dissolution of Brygada Kryzys, Brylewski shortly played in a band called Anarchia. In early spring of 1983, together with Pawe≈Ç \\"Kelner\\" Rozwadowski, they founded reggae band Izrael. The name was invented by Brylewski in March 1983. As he said in his biography, he had used to listen to ska music, such bands, as The Specials, The Beat, or Madness. He also liked The Clash, and as he says, in reggae he found independent culture, which was not created by the government or by the market. He began to wear dreadlocks, but never used to call himself a rastaman. At that time (1983‚Äì1985), Brylewski used to read the Bible, the Koran and the Bhagavad Gita, he was also impressed by Pope John Paul II: \\"In reggae I found independent culture, which was not created by government's agencies or the markets, but it was created by itself, on the street, and nothing could stop its expansion. Punk rock also was a spontaneous movement, not to be stopped. After punk rock, we were hungry for such energy. In reggae I was inspired by the energy of the music, and later I came to know that it was a widely understood culture, which was not only about entertainment, but also about spirituality, social and mental changes\\" (page 174 of Brylewski's autobiography). Izrael was founded in March 1983, and in May of that year, its first LP, called Biada, Biada, Biada was recorded in a studio at Wawrzyszew, district of Warsaw (it also was the first album of a Polish reggae band, but was not published until 1985). Brylewski wrote songs for it together with Rozwadowski, at Kelner's apartment located in a Communist high rise at Sadyba: \\"In 1983 there was nothing attractive happening. Communication was not easy, so I spent plenty of time with Kelner. We stayed at his apartment, practising together. I played the guitar, Kelner played the bass, and then we switched\\". (page 193). Soon after recording the album, Izrael toured Poland, together with Misty in Roots (summer 1983). During one of band's shows, which took place in Krak√≥w, Brylewski met his future wife Vivian Quarcoo, a Polish-African singer in a jazz band. She began to sing with Izrael, and after some time, moved in with Robert. Their first daughter Sara was born in 1986, second daughter Ewa, in 1990. In 1984 ‚Äì 1986, Izrael toured Poland, playing at various festivals, including FAMA at ≈öwinouj≈õcie, Jarocin Festival, and Brodnica Music Camping. One of Izrael's concerts, which took place on May 9, 1986, at Opole, was broken down by the ZOMO. In 1985, Brylewski began to cooperate with Dariusz Malejonek, who had his own reggae band, Kultura. In the course of the time, the two bands merged, keeping the name Izrael. Together with bandmates, Brylewski did not drink a lot of alcohol, smoking marijuana instead. As he said in his autobiography: \\"Smoking marijuana had special importance for us. It built new links, as grass functioned at that time in different circumstances than now. People would not sell it to each other, they shared it\\". (page 235). In the summer 1985, Izrael recorded its second album, Nabij fajƒô (Fill up the pipe). Almost all songs were written by Brylewski, who also created its cover. The album was recorded in Pozna≈Ñ, due to band's cooperation with PolJazz publishing house. Soon afterwards, Brylewski co-produced Fala, a compilation album: \\"These were times full of naivety, times without divisions, as the Church and Solidarity were one front. We were young and inexperienced, we did not know that in times of threat everything looked different than in times of peace\\". (page 248).  1985 ‚Äì 1990  The Jarocin Festival in 1984 was marked by performances of two bands, Izrael and Siekiera. After Siekiera's show, Brylewski went to talk to members of the band, later inviting Siekiera to Warsaw's R√≥brege Festival. Soon afterwards Brylewski noticed that Siekiera's leaders, Tomasz Adamski and Tomasz Budzy≈Ñski did not get along well, and at some point Budzy≈Ñski suggested starting a band with Brylewski. Thus Armia (also called Antiarmia) was created, together with S≈Çawomir Go≈Çaszewski, Brygada Kryzys drummer Janusz Ro≈Çt, and Izrael's bassists Tomasz ≈ªmijewski and Alik Dziki. As Brylewski said in the autobiography: \\"At first Armia was a refreshing new idea, the return to my roots. This music was free from any schools and styles, we used sounds and chords that were not played by regular musicians (...) Our sound was like a thick, concrete wall, with maximum energy. Main point was not to play any guitar solos, as we ran away from rock. We had an impression that we no longer chased the West, it was Western musicians who had to keep up with us\\". (pages 253 ‚Äì 254). Together with Budzy≈Ñski, Robert Brylewski was at that time impressed with Aguirre, the Wrath of God (this film influenced Armia's lyrics), books of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Native American culture and Christianity. As he says, first Armia's recordings of 1985 showed that the band already had a plan for its sound: \\"After the first single, it was obvious that Armia would create its own world, like Izrael did. We played what we called \\"a fairy tale music\\" (...) I associated Armia with forces of nature (...) I do not remember how Indians appeared in the band. I guess we all had in minds the notion of noble Winnetou, so Indian symbols dominated in our graphic designs\\". (pages 259 ‚Äì 262) In 1987, Armia recorded its first LP, Aguirre, at one of the first Polish private studios in Rzesz√≥w. Since Izrael and Deuter also recorded their LPs there, Brylewski, who continued to be a member of Izrael, altogether spent two months in Rzesz√≥w, having been arrested there twice. Apart from Aguirre, Brylewski recorded another Izrael's LP, Duchowa rewolucja, cooperating closely with Dariusz Malejonek, who had previously been leader of another reggae band, Kultura. At 1985 Jarocin Festival, Izrael and Kultura merged, keeping the name Izrael. For most of the 1980s, all Brylewski's bands practiced at the Hybrydy Student Culture Center in Warsaw. In 1983 the club began to organize the annual R√≥brege Festival, and Brylewski, together with Rozwadowski were responsible for the selection of bands: \\"The rule was that on the first day of the festival, punk rock bands were presented. On the second day ‚Äì reggae, on the third day ‚Äì different music genres. Bands were recommended to us from different people, so the guys from Dezerter suggested Kortatu (...) R√≥brege always took place in the autumn, after the Jarocin Festivals, where we got in touch with people, listened to bands\\". (page 279) In the mid-1980s Brylewski opened his own recording studio Z≈Çota Ska≈Ça (Gold Rock), issuing first Armia's tapes in 1986. Since most underground bands in Communist Poland were unable to have their songs published by official companies, Brylewski decided to help them, recording and then publishing their work. At the same time, together with Rozwadowski, he created a music project T-34, named after a famous Soviet tank. In 1988, Brylewski went to London, as he stated: \\"because I wanted to see this city and buy a good guitar\\" (page 289). For two months he worked at a construction site, living in the district of Brixton. After coming back to Poland, he left Warsaw and with family moved to the village of Stanclewo, located in historic province of Masuria. Together with other musicians, he opened there the Gold Rock studio, and stayed at Stanclewo for two years (1988‚Äì1990): \\"More and more often I remained at Stanclewo, only with wife and children, which was troublesome. Without the band, I had little to do there. At that time communication was difficult, but still I was the last of those settlers, who gave up, only after Izrael's practices in Warsaw began to take place without me\\".

It was originally built in gratitude for victory at the Battle of Lake Regillus (495 BC). Castor and Pollux (Greek Polydeuces) were the Dioscuri, the \\"twins\\" of Gemini, the twin sons of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda. Their cult came to Rome from Greece via Magna Graecia and the Greek culture of Southern Italy. The Roman temple is one of a number of known Dioscuri temples remaining from antiquity. Founding The last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and his allies, the Latins, waged war on the infant Roman Republic. Before the battle, the Roman dictator Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis vowed to build a temple to the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) if the Republic were victorious. According to legend, Castor and Pollux appeared on the battlefield as two able horsemen in aid of the Republic; and after the battle had been won they again appeared on the Forum in Rome watering their horses at the Spring of Juturna thereby announcing the victory. The temple stands on the supposed spot of their appearance. One of Postumius‚Äô sons was elected duumvir in order to dedicate the temple on 15 July (the ides of July) 484 BC.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.42 Roman coin depicting the Dioscuri. Republican Period. The British Museum. History During the Republican period, the temple served as a meeting place for the Roman Senate, and from the middle of the 2nd century BC the front of the podium served as a speaker's platform. During the imperial period, the temple housed the office for weights and measures, and was a depository for the State treasury. Chambers located between the foundation piers of the temple were used to conduct this business. Based on finds from the drains, one of the chambers was likely used by a dentist. The archaic temple was completely reconstructed and enlarged in 117 BC by Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus after his victory over the Dalmatians. Gaius Verres again restored this second temple in 73 BC. Commemorating the initial victory at Lake Regillus, a large cavalry parade was held each year on July 15th and featured as many as 5,000 young men carrying shields and spears. Two young men, riding white horses, led the parade and represented Castor and Pollux. In 14 BC a fire that ravaged major parts of the forum destroyed the temple, and Tiberius, the son of Livia by a previous marriage and adopted son of Augustus and the eventual heir to the throne, rebuilt it. Tiberius' temple was dedicated in 6 AD. The remains visible today are from the temple of Tiberius, except the podium, which is from the time of Metellus. In conjunction with this imperial rebuilding, the cult itself became associated with the imperial family. Initially, the twins were identified with Augustus's intended heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar. After their premature deaths, however, the association with Castor and Pollux passed to Tiberius and his brother Drusus. According to Edward Gibbon, the temple of Castor served as a secret meeting place for the Roman Senate. Frequent meetings of the Senate are also reported by Cicero.Cicero, In Verrem 2.1.129 Gibbon said the senate was roused to rebellion against Emperor Maximinus Thrax and in favor of future emperor Gordian I at the Temple of Castor in 237 AD. If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. The temple was possibly already falling apart in the fourth century, when a wall in front of the Lacus Juturnae was erected from reused material. Nothing is known of its subsequent history, except that in the 15th century, only three columns of its original structure were still standing. The street running by the building was called via Trium Columnarum. In 1760, the Conservatori, finding the columns in a state of imminent collapse, erected scaffolding for effecting repairs. Both Piranesi and the young English architect George Dance the Younger were able to climb up and make accurate measurements; Dance had \\"a Model cast from the finest Example of the Corinthian order perhaps in the whole World\\", as he reported to his father.Quoted in Frank Salmon, \\"'Storming the Campo Vaccino': British Architects and the Antique Buildings of Rome after Waterloo\\" Architectural History 38 (1995:146-175) p. 149f. Today the podium survives without the facing, as do the three columns and a piece of the entablature, one of the most famous features in the Forum. Architecture The octastyle temple was peripteral, with eight Corinthian columns at the short sides and eleven on the long sides. There was a single cella paved with mosaics. The podium measures and in height. The building was constructed in opus caementicium and originally covered with slabs of tuff which were later removed. According to ancient sources, the temple had a single central stairway to access the podium, but excavations have identified two side stairs. Archaeology The temple complex was excavated and studied between 1983 and 1989 by a joint archaeological mission of the Nordic academies in Rome, led by Inge Nielsen and B. Poulsen. Sketch by Piranesi featuring the three remaining columns from the Temple of Castor and Pollux  Other Temples of Castor and Pollux  The Roman temple is one of a number of known Dioscuri sites remaining from antiquity. Among others, * the Baroque basilica church of San Paolo Maggiore in Naples is built on the site of a Temple of Castor and Pollux. Its porch and pediment survived until the 1688 Sannio earthquake; only two Corinthian columns remain, incorporated into the facade of the church. * The vanished Anakeion near the Acropolis in Athens was a Dioscuri temple. Writing in about 150 AD, Pausanias described it as ancient. * Pausanias identified another temple in Argos depicting Castor and Pollux, their sons Anaxias and Mnasinus, and their wives Hilaeira and Phoebe. * The extensive ruins of the Valle dei Templi in Agrigento, Sicily, include the site of another Temple of the Dioscuri. In his 1888 description of the Dioscuri temple in ancient Greek colonial city of Naucratis in Egypt, Ernest Arthur Gardner remarked that such temples were common enough to have a characteristic orientation. Temples to the gods tended to face east. Temples to heroes and demi-gods such as Castor and Pollux faced west.

History The Quapaw Nation (known as ' in their own language) are descended from a historical group of Dhegian-Siouan speaking people who lived in the lower Ohio River valley area. The modern descendants of this group also include the Omaha, Ponca, Osage and Kaw. The Quapaw and the other Dhegiha Siouan speaking tribes are believed to have migrated from the Ohio River valley after 1200 CE. Scholars are divided in whether they think the Quapaw and other related groups left before or after the Beaver Wars of the 17th century, in which the more powerful Five Nations of the Iroquois drove out other tribes from the Ohio Valley and retained the area for hunting grounds.Louis F. Burns, \\"Osage\\" Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, retrieved 2 March 2009 They arrived at their historical territory, the area of the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers, at minimum by the mid-17th century. The timing of the Quapaw migration into their ancestral territory in the historical period has been the subject of considerable debate by scholars of various fields. It is referred to as the \\"Quapaw Paradox\\" by academics. Many professional archaeologists have introduced numerous migration scenarios and time frames, but none has conclusive evidence. Glottochronological studies suggest the Quapaw separated from the other Dhegihan-speaking peoples ranging between AD 950 to as late as AD 1513. The Illinois and other Algonquian-speaking peoples to the northeast referred to them as the ' or ', meaning \\"land of the downriver people\\". As French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet met the Illinois before they did the Quapaw, they adopted this exonym for the more westerly people. English- speaking settlers who arrived later in the region adopted the name used by the French. During years of colonial rule of New France, many of the French fur traders and voyageurs had an amicable relationship with the Quapaw, as with many other trading tribes. Many Quapaw women and French men married and had families together. Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was founded by Joseph Bonne, a man of Quapaw-French ancestry. √âcore Fabre (Fabre's Bluff) was started as a trading post by the Frenchman Fabre and was one of the first European settlements in south central Arkansas. While the area was ruled by the Spanish from 1763‚Äì1789, following French defeat in the Seven Years' War, they did not have as many colonists in the area. After increased American settlement following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, √âcore Fabre was renamed as Camden. English speakers tried to adapt French names to English phonetics: ' (French for \\"covered way or road\\") was gradually converted to \\"Smackover\\" by Anglo- Americans. They used this name for a local creek. Founded by the French, ' was translated into English and renamed by Americans as Little Rock after the United States acquired the territory in the Purchase. Numerous spelling variations have been recorded in accounts of tribal names, reflecting both loose spelling traditions, and the effects of transliteration of names into the variety of European languages used in the area. Some sources listed Ouachita as a Choctaw word, whereas others list it as a Quapaw word. Either way, the spelling reflects transliteration into French. The following passages are taken from the public domain Catholic Encyclopedia, written early in the 20th century. It describes the Quapaw from the non-native perspective of that time. Some of the tribe has strong Cherokee kin relationships then and now. > A tribe now nearly extinct, but formerly one of the most important of the > lower Mississippi region, occupying several villages about the mouth of the > Arkansas, chiefly on the west (Arkansas) side, with one or two at various > periods on the east (Mississippi) side of the Mississippi, and claiming the > whole of the Arkansas River region up to the border of the territory held by > the Osage in the north-western part of the state.

Based on the Charles M. Hudson map of 1997. =Early European contact= In 1541, when the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto led an expedition that came across the town of Pacaha (also recorded by Garcilaso as Capaha), between the Mississippi River and a lake on the Arkansas side, apparently in present-day Phillips County. His party describe the village as strongly palisaded and nearly surrounded by a ditch. Archaeological remains and local conditions bear out the description. If the migration out of the Ohio Valley preceded the entrada, these people may have been the proto-Quapaw. However, given the use of the Tunica language in Pacaha and the evidence for a late Quapaw migration to Arkansas, it is likely that the people whom de Soto met were Tunica. The first certain encounters with Quapaw by Europeans occurred more than 130 years later. In 1673, the Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette accompanied the French commander Louis Jolliet in making his noted voyage down the Mississippi. He reportedly went to the villages of the Akansea, who gave him warm welcome and listened with attention to his sermons, while he stayed with them a few days. In 1682 La Salle passed by their villages, then five in number, of which one was on the east bank of the Mississippi. A Recollect father, Zenobius Membr√©, who accompanied the LaSalle expediton planted a cross and attempted to convert the Native Americans to Christianity. The commander negotiated a peace with the tribe and formally \\"claimed\\" the territory for France. The Quapaw were uniformly kind and friendly toward the French. In spite of frequent shiftings, there were four Quapaw villages generally reported along the Mississippi River in this early period. They corresponded in name and population to four sub-tribes still existing, listed as ', ', ', and ', or, under their French transliterations: Kappa, Ossoteoue, Touriman, and Tonginga. Kappa was reported to have been on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River and the other three located on the western bank in or near present-day Desha County, Arkansas. In 1721 depopulation led to the consolidation of Tourima and Tongigua into one village. Ossoteoue or Osotouy was situated at the mouth of the Arkansas River and is now thought to be an archaeological site known as the Menard-Hodges Mounds. In 1686 the French commander Henri de Tonti built a post on the Arkansas River, near its mouth, that later was known as the Arkansas Post. This began European occupation of the Quapaw country. Tonti arranged also for a resident Jesuit missionary, but apparently without result. About 1697 a smallpox epidemic killed the greater part of the women and children of two villages. In 1727 the Jesuits, from their house in New Orleans, again took up the missionary work. In 1729 the Quapaw allied with the French against the Natchez, resulting in the practical extermination of the Natchez. The French relocated the Arkansas Post upriver, trying to avoid flooding. After losing to the British in the Seven Years' War, France ceded its North American territories to Britain. This nation exchanged territory with Spain, which took over \\"control\\" of Arkansas and other former French territory west of the Mississippi River. It built new forts to protect its valued trading post with the Quapaw. =19th century= Shortly after the United States acquired the territory in 1803 by the Louisiana Purchase, it recorded the Quapaw as living in three villages on the south side of the Arkansas River about above Arkansas Post. In 1818, they made their first treaty with the US government, ceding all claims from the Red River to beyond the Arkansas and east of the Mississippi. They kept a considerable tract between the Arkansas and the Saline, in the southeastern part of the state. Under continued US pressure, in 1824 they ceded this also, excepting occupied by the chief Saracen below Pine Bluff. They expected to incorporate with the Caddo of Louisiana, but were refused permission. Successive floods in the Caddo country near the Red River pushed many toward starvation, and they wandered back to their old homes. In 1834, under another treaty, the Quapaw were removed from the Mississippi valley areas to their present location in the northeast corner of Oklahoma, then Indian Territory. Sarrasin (alternate spelling Saracen), their last chief before the removal, was a Roman Catholic and friend of the Lazarist missionaries (Congregation of the Missions), who had arrived in 1818. He died about 1830 and is buried adjoining St. Joseph's Church, Pine Bluff, where a memorial window preserves his name. The pioneer Lazarist missionary among the Quapaw was Rev. John M. Odin, who later served as the Archbishop of New Orleans. In 1824 the Jesuits of Maryland, under Father Charles Van Quickenborne, took up work among the native and immigrant tribes of present- day Kansas and Oklahoma. In 1846 the Mission of St. Francis was established among the Osage, on Neosho River, by Fathers John Shoenmakers and John Bax, who extended their services to the Quapaw for some years. The Quapaw together with the associated remnant tribes, the Miami, Seneca, Wyandot and Ottawa, were served from the Mission of \\"Saint Mary of the Quapaws\\", at Quapaw, Oklahoma. Historians estimated their number at European encounter as 5000. The Catholic Encyclopedia noted the people had suffered from high fatalities due to epidemics, wars, removals, and social disruption. It documented their numbers as 3200 in 1687, 1600 in 1750, 476 in 1843, and 307 in 1910, including all mixed bloods. Peter Clabber, Principal Chief of Quapaws, 1905 =Kinship, religion and culture= Besides the four established divisions already noted, the Quapaw have the clan system, with a number of gentes. Polygamy was practiced, but was not common. They were agricultural. Their towns were palisaded. Their town houses, or public structures, are referred to as longhouses and are constructed with timbers dovetailed together and bark roofs, were commonly erected upon large man-made mounds to guard against the frequent flooding. Their ordinary houses were rectangular and long enough to accommodate several families. The Quapaw dug large ditches, and constructed fish weirs to manage their food supply. They excelled in pottery and in the painting of hide for bed covers and other purposes. The dead were buried in the ground, sometimes in mounds or in the clay floors of their houses, being frequently strapped to a stake in a sitting position and then covered with earth. They were friendly to the Europeans, while warring with the Chickasaw and other Southeastern tribes over resources and trade. =20th century= Quapaw moccasins, ca. 1900, Oklahoma History Center In the early 20th century, an account noted that the Dhegiha language, a branch of Siouan including the \\"dialects\\" of the Omaha, Ponca, Osage, Kansa, and Quapaw, has received more extended study. Rev. J.O. Dorsey published material about it under the auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology, now part of the Smithsonian Institution.Pilling, Siouan Bibliography In media The 2009 documentary Tar Creek, about the Tar Creek Superfund Site, located on Quapaw tribal lands, which at one time was considered to be the worst environmental disaster in the country. The film discusses the alleged racism of environmental and governmental practices that led to the neglect and lack of regulation resulting in this site, and subsequent ill effects, including lead poisoning of a high percentage of children. In 2018, Infinite Productions produced a documentary titled The Pride of the Ogahpah about the story of the Downstream Casino Resort, which is operated by The Quapaw Nation.

Background ThrasyllusThe name Thrasyllus is an ancient Greek name which derives from the Greek thrasy ‚Äì meaning bold was an Egyptian of Greek descent from unknown origins, as his family and ancestors were contemporaries that lived under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. He originally was either from Mendes or Alexandria. Thrasyllus is often mentioned in various secondary sources as coming from Alexandria (as mentioned in the Oxford Classical Dictionary) as no primary source confirms his origins. Tiberius Thrasyllus encountered Tiberius during the period of Tiberius' voluntary exile on the Greek island of Rhodes, some time between 1 BC and 4 AD.Levick, Tiberius: The Politician, p.7 Thrasyllus became the intimate and celebrated servant of Tiberius, and Tiberius developed an interest in Stoicism and Astrology from Thrasyllus.Levick, Tiberius: The Politician, p. 7 He predicted that Tiberius would be recalled to Rome and officially named the successor to Augustus. When Tiberius returned to Rome, Thrasyllus accompanied him and remained close to him.Thrasyllus‚Äô article at ancient library During the reign of the emperor Tiberius, Thrasyllus served as his skilled Court Astrologer both in Rome and, later, in Capri.Holden, A History of Horoscopic Astrology, p. 26 As Tiberius held Thrasyllus in the highest honor, he rewarded him for his friendship by giving Roman citizenship to him and his family.Levick, Tiberius: The Politician, p. 7 The daughter-in-law of Tiberius, his niece Livilla, reportedly consulted Thrasyllus during her affair with Sejanus, Tiberius' chief minister. Thrasyllus persuaded Tiberius to leave Rome for Capri while clandestinely supporting Sejanus. The grandson-in-law of Thrasyllus, Naevius Sutorius Macro, carried out orders that destroyed Sejanus, whether with Thrasyllus‚Äô knowledge is unknown.

Tiberius, believing in Thrasyllus, was confident that he would outlive any plotters, and so failed to act against them. Thrasyllus predeceased Tiberius, so did not live to see the realization of his prediction that Caligula would succeed Tiberius. Academic work Thrasyllus by profession was a grammarian (i.e. literary scholar).Holden, A History of Horoscopic Astrology, p. 26 He edited the written works of Plato and Democritus. According to the Encyclopaedia Judaica, he wrote that the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt took place in 1690 BC. The sections include, Dedumose I, Ipuwer Papyrus and Shiphrah.

Thrasyllus' predictions are always correct, and his prophecies are equally far-reaching. Thrasyllus predicts Jesus of Nazareth's crucifixion and that his religion shall overtake the Roman Pagan Religion. Similarly towards the end of his life it is explained that his final prophecy was misinterpreted by Tiberius. Thrasyllus states that \\"Tiberius Claudius will be emperor in 10 years,\\" leading Tiberius to brashly criticize and mock Caligula, whereas his prophecy is correct as Claudius' name is \\"Tiberius Claudius\\". In the TV miniseries adaptation of the novels, Thrasyllus was played by Kevin Stoney, who had previously played him in the 1968 ITV series The Caesars.

It is a guandao, a type of traditional Chinese weapon. It is also sometimes referred to as the Frost Fair Blade (ÂÜ∑Ë±îÈã∏), from the idea that during a battle in the snow, the blade continuously had blood on it; the blood froze and made a layer of frost on the blade. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the blade is forged by a local blacksmith using steel sponsored by Zhang Shiping (Âºµ‰∏ñÂπ≥), a merchant sympathetic to Liu Bei's cause. When Guan Yu meets his end in 219, the blade is given to Pan Zhang by Sun Quan for his role in capturing Guan Yu. During the Battle of Yiling, Guan Yu's son Guan Xing kills Pan Zhang when the latter is stunned by a vision of Guan Yu's spirit. Guan Xing then takes back the Green Dragon Crescent Blade and later passes it down the generations from father to son in the Guan family. Historical validity It is highly questionable whether Guan Yu actually wielded the Green Dragon or whether it was merely part of the myths surrounding him. Valid historical texts from his time period made no mention of him or anyone wielding a similar weapon. Because the guandao was known not to be widely used until the Song Dynasty, there is some doubt as to whether the guandao existed during Guan Yu's time. The guandao may not have been very widely used because it was both difficult to wield and heavy (Guan Yu, reportedly, was able to wield it with agility with just one hand, while most people would have trouble using it effectively even with both hands). However, this may be due to the legend regarding the weight surrounding the blade, whereas in reality, it was much lighter. According to Chapter 1 of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the Green Dragon Crescent Blade was said to weigh 82 catties. During the Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms periods, one catty was approximately 220 grams, so 82 catties would have been approximately 18 kilograms (~40 pounds). A weapon weighing about 100 pounds (~45 kilograms), purported to be the Green Dragon Crescent Blade, is on display at the Purple Cloud Temple in China today. Rumored origins Legend says that Guan Yu invented the guandao. He had it forged after he met Liu Bei and Zhang Fei but before he made the Oath of the Peach Garden. The story of the blade was that there was a blacksmith forging the blade when suddenly a green dragon passed by. The dragon was cut up and the body became part of the pieces therefore making the dao a magical weapon.

He created his debut graphic novel after a decades-long career as an underground cartoonist. It deals with homosexuality and racism in the 1960s in the southern United States, in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. While the book is not autobiographical, it draws upon Cruse's experience of growing up in the South during this time period, including his accidental fathering of a child, as referred to in the title. Background Howard Cruse was born in 1940s Alabama to a Baptist preacher and his wife. He earned a degree in drama and worked in television before turning to a cartooning career. From 1971 he published a strip called Barefootz, which appeared in a number of underground comix publications, including three issues under its own title. Cruse's contemporaries gave it little regard, deeming it too cute and gentle compared to the countercultural works alongside which it ran. In 1976, Cruse introduced a gay character into the strip, committing to the gay liberation movement. In 1979 Denis Kitchen of Kitchen Sink Press invited Cruse to edit the comic-book anthology Gay Comix; the first issue appeared in 1980. From 1983 to 1989 Cruse produced Wendel, an ongoing humorous comic strip for the LGBT magazine The Advocate. Publication history Piranha Press, an imprint of DC Comics for alternative comics, contracted with Cruse for a graphic novel. It gave him an advance against royalties to cover expenses for the two years projected to finish the book; it ultimately took four years. When his finances became tight, Cruse took time away from the book to raise funds by applying for grants and selling original art pages from the book before they were drawn. Piranha Press was discontinued in 1994, before Cruse finished the book. It was instead published by DC's Paradox Press imprint in 1995 in hardcover, and in paperback in 1996 by HarperCollins In 2010, DC published a new edition under its Vertigo imprint. Cruse's agents Denis Kitchen and John Lind moved the book to First Second Books, which published a 25th Anniversary edition in 2020, incorporating unpublished material from Cruse's archives; the book was released a few months after his death. Playwright Tony Kushner wrote an introduction to the first edition. Cartoonist Alison Bechdel contributed an introduction to the 2010 reprint edition. Translations have been published in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Plot summary Decades after the book's events, the forty-something Toland Polk narrates his youth in the fictional town of Clayfield, in the American South in the 1950s and 1960s. After his parents die in a car accident, he finds he has no direction. He chooses to work for a gas station rather than go to college. Polk becomes involved with the black community and the Civil Rights Movement. At the same time, he courts a folk singer named Ginger in the hopes of \\"curing\\" his homosexuality. Together they have a child they give up for adoption. Polk finds the black community more accepting of his homosexuality than his own white community. The bombing of a black community center, the lynching of a gay friend, and other such events push him to social activism. Style and analysis The dense black-and-white artwork is more restrained and less cartoony than that of Cruse's earlier work. Cruse abandons his trademark stippling for heavily crosshatching. He gives particular attention to buildings and other background details, and to rendering characters with individuality. Ben Bolling likens the rounded rendering of the figures to those in the paintings of American artist Paul Cadmus. The pages are dense with dialogue balloons. The frame story, set off with rounded panel borders, takes place in the late 1980s or early 1990s, as the adult Toland narrates with his male partner by his side. The narration appears to occur over a substantial span of time, as the pair's clothing and background reflect seasonal changes from summer to winter. Overview The story is not autobiographical, but Cruse draws from his experiences growing up in Birmingham, Alabama. He also includes such historical events as the 1955 murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham in 1963. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Cruse said that he based the novel on his own experiences in the 1960s and his \\"anger at the degree to which the ideals of the Civil Rights Era were being abandoned.\\" In another interview, Cruse stated, \\"My goal was to create the kind of novel that is too full of incident for someone to simply summarize in their mind in one sentence. I wanted it to be like life, where you spend a year of your life and you can‚Äôt just remember everything that happened, but it's all part of a process.\\" =Character list= * Toland Polk, the main character/protagonist * Melanie, Toland's sister * Orley, Melanie‚Äôs husband * Stetson, an elderly handyman/gardener who worked for the Toland family * Ben, Stetson's son * Ginger Raines, Toland's old girlfriend * Riley Wheeler, Toland's friend * Mavis Greene, Riley's girlfriend * Sammy Noone, a longtime gay friend of Mavis & Riley * Lester Pepper, the gay son of preacher Harland Pepper * Reverend Harland Pepper, a preacher and nonviolent social activist * Anna Dellyne Pepper, a former New York singer and the preacher's wife * Shiloh Reed, a singer who suffers from brain damage following an accident * Lottie, Shiloh's wife, who has cancer * Sledge Rankin, a black person who is murdered by the KKK * Robert Samson, a friend and bi-sexual lover * Esmo \\"Esmereldus\\", a drag queen * Mabel Older, a piano player and Effie's sister * Cindy Neuworth, Mabel's younger, \\"butchy\\" girlfriend * Marge, a lesbian, Effie's partner and co-owner of Alleysax * Effie, Marge's partner and co-owner of Alleysax and Mabel's sister * Father Edgar Morris, another preacher in town Reception and legacy Stuck Rubber Baby was published with high expectations, given the success of Art Spiegelman's graphic novel Maus (1991). Stuck Rubber Baby won a favorable critical reception, but its sales were modest. The book won the award for Best Graphic Novel at the Eisners, Harveys, and UK Comic Art Awards. It was nominated for the American Library Association's Lesbian and Gay Book Award and the Lambda Literary Award. It won the 2002 French Prix de la critique and the Luche award in Germany. Comics writer Harvey Pekar wrote that, if enough people read it, \\"it surely will help convince the general public that comics can appeal to adults.\\" Upon its reprinting in 2011, Comics Alliance wrote that Cruse \\"harnessed a symphony of discordant subtleties\\". Cartoonist and comics scholar Justin Hall wrote of the importance of this work: \\"Stuck Rubber Baby, with its complex meditations on race, sexuality, and gender in the Civil Rights era Alabama is perhaps the closest we‚Äôve come yet to the Great American Graphic Novel.\\" The book has generated some controversy because of its subject matter. In 2004, a Texas citizens' group asked that it be removed from the young adult section of the local library. Cruse's earlier work influenced Alison Bechdel in her comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For. She later published the graphic novels Fun Home (2006) and Are You My Mother? (2012), which also deal with an individual's homosexual awakening.

The county ceased to exist when the province of New Brunswick was created in 1784. The county was created in 1765, alongside a formal enlargement of Cumberland County north and westward (taking in present-day Westmoreland and Albert Counties, New Brunswick). Sunbury County's seat and its court of general sessions were established at Campobello Island, in Passamaquoddy Bay.William B. Hamilton, 'Place Names of Atlantic Canada,' University of Toronto Press, 1996 Campobello was fairly central on the coast under its purview, as Sunbury included what the Province of Massachusetts regarded as the eastern portion of its district of Maine. (In practice, neither Boston nor Halifax were interested in expending energy or money to administer the area so the geographic overlap was permitted to exist.) In 1784, in part due to the immigration to Nova Scotia of many thousands of Loyalists refugees, Sunbury County, with the newer, mainland portion of Cumberland, became the Colony of New Brunswick. British recognition of U.S. Independence had necessitated the turnover of the western third of Sunbury to the District of Maine, then still part of Massachusetts. After much redefinition and reduction in subsequent decades, there remains in central New Brunswick a county holding the name Sunbury.

The western side of Bacnotan faces the South China Sea and has a long stretch of black sand beaches, indicating a large amount of magnetite. Some portions of the seashore have pebble and limestone deposits. The beaches, stretching about 16 kilometers, are suitable for fishing, boating, swimming, snorkeling, diving and surfing. Although San Juan is a favorite place among serious surfers, the waves in Quirino have been discovered to be likewise excellent for surfing.

In 1785, during the administration of the Governor-General Jose Basco, Bacnotan became a part of Pangasinan. When La Union was created in 1850, Bacnotan was one of the 12 towns that formed the province. In the past, Bacnotan was only a vast expanse of wilderness inhabited by natives with a rudimentary form of government. There was a time when it was ruled by a despotic chieftain who had absolute control over all his constituents. Disobedience to his directives meant severe flogging of the culprit. After several years under the tyrannical rule of the chieftain, the people overthrew him and flogged their chieftain to death. The word \\"basnutan\\" means \\"flog\\" in the local dialect, and become a byword among the inhabitants, hence the name of the town. During the Spanish period, the name of the town was changed from \\"basnutan\\" to \\"Bacnotan\\" as shown by documents which are still kept intact at the National Archives in Manila. The town's history is linked with the deeds of heroic men who fought, bled, and died for their own native land. At the turn of the century, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Dumarang (now known as Quirino), was a scene of carnage and plunder. During the first days of World War II, invading Japanese forces reached Bacnotan on December 21, 1941. On January 4, 1945, the tides of war changed in La Union as Filipino and American soldiers captured the strategic Baroro Bridge in Bacnotan, which connects the rest of Northern Luzon to San Fernando. It was followed by the historic Battle of San Fernando and Bacsil Bridge. The victory ensured the liberation of La Union Province by joint Filipino and American troops at the end of World War II. After the war, Bacnotan became the provisional seat of provincial government, since San Fernando was then in ruins. As a consequence of this transfer, the La Union National High School was also moved to Bacnotan. When things went back to normal, the provincial government was again moved to San Fernando and the La Union National High School followed afterwards. The transfer of the provincial high school in Bacnotan resulted in the establishment of the North Provincial High School (now Bacnotan National High School.) In 1949, the vast mineral deposits of limestone used in portland cement production were noticed in Barrio Dumarang (now Quirino) by a mining engineer who was then a municipal councilor at that time. Because of the desire to create economic activity, the municipal council, through the efforts of this mining engineer, invited potential investors to set up a Portland cement plant. Within a year, a cement plant called Cebu Portland Cement (CEPOC), was established. On May 11, 1957, CEPOC, a government-owned corporation, was sold to the privately owned Bacnotan Consolidated Industries (BCI). BCI is the manufacturer of \\"Union Cement\\". In 2004, BCI was sold to Holcim Cement. On June 18, 1960, the La Union Agricultural School was established. Nestling at the foot of the mountains of Barangay Sapilang, the agricultural school progressed and was later named Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University. Its campus occupies an area of about 6 square kilometers. Demographics In the , the population of Bacnotan was people, with a density of . Ilocano is the primary language spoken.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology Tradition reveals that Bagulin derived its name from a Kankanaey tribal leader. In the middle of the 18th century, the municipality is part of the township of Allabok which covers the moderate slopes of the mountain ranges overlooking the China Sea. During those times, war tribes was prevalent. Allabok involved itself in a tribal war headed by Bagulin who led the community to victory. From then on until his death, people highly regarded him as their noble leader. After his death, consensus with the residents together with the concurrence of Spanish authorities resulted in naming the community after Bagulin. At present, Kankanaey still dominate the town‚Äôs population. Another etymological version dictates that \\"Bagulin\\" was derived from the term bago which means \\"lowland natives\\". This version is further supported by the fact that Kankanaeys comprise about 85% of the municipal population. Geography Bagulin is situated at the interior eastern portion of La Union. It is generally mountainous and forested. It is bounded by the following municipalities: * North ‚Äî San Gabriel * West ‚Äî City of San Fernando * Southwest ‚Äî Naguilian * South ‚Äî Burgos * East ‚Äî Kapangan Bagulin is away from San Fernando, the regional center, away from Naguilian, its nearby town and away from Baguio City.

By 1903, the American regime established a paramilitary government and institutional facilities. Education was introduced and a bamboo community hall roofed with cogon was erected. As of 1903, the community was under the jurisdiction of the Mountain Province, sub-province of Benguet with capital at La Trinidad. By 1918, under the agreement of Governor Guzman of Mt. Province and Governor Pio Ancheta of La Union, Bagulin became a municipal district of Burgos under the province of La Union. By 1928, the community centers was moved to a nearby settlement called Suyo where the present town center is situated. The former community center was named ‚ÄúNangalisan‚Äù which means an abandoned place in the Ilokano language. Settlers who improved Suyo were Ilokano people who came from Naguilian. At that time, a bamboo chalet was constructed to serve as an administrative hall. The administration then was composed of the Mayor, a Secretary-Treasurer and one policeman. Municipal income is very small that the administration had to prod reluctant taxpayers to pay their dues. On June 25, 1963, Bagulin was transformed into a regular, full-pledged municipality by virtue of Executive Order No. 42.

The town's present name originated during the Spanish colonial era. A group of Spanish soldiers were on patrol and went on to rest on a sitio. The villagers were curious about the soldiers because of their unusual descent and fair skin color. They flocked the soldiers touching their guns, too afraid that the guns might explode accidentally, one villager asked the soldier in a local vernacular.. \\"Aoan bala?\\" (meaning \\"No bullets?\\"). The soldier did not understand what the villager meant, he uttered the last word first, and remembering the last, he said \\"Bala-aoan\\". During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, a secret society of insurrectos was organized in the municipality. Its purpose was to fight and revolt against the Spanish Government in the area. On the eve of the revolution, a traitor told the Spanish of their plan. The Spanish soldiers, without any investigation arrested seven members of the secret society, and executed them the same night. Only one, Fernando Ostrea, escaped with leg wounds. He informed the people about what has happened. In memory of the seven Martyrs, a masonic lodge, Siete Martires Lodge No. 177, was organized. Balaoan is one of the oldest municipalities in La Union, having been founded in 1704. Its first Capitan is Ignacio Duldulao.

It is said that the Amburayan River which partly flowed through Bangar was a favourite swimming hole for Spaniards and the early illustrados. * Bangaoilan - Once called \\"Anonang\\", the town was renamed because of the abundance of a poisonous plant called bangaoil. * Barraca - This barrio was formed from the two sitio of Binyadura and Nagpalcan. Barraca was adopted as the common name after residents of both hamlets signed a pact to end a violent feud. * Cadapli - This was taken from the Ilokano words cadcadapa (\\"crawling\\") and apli (\\"mat\\"). This name was adopted after several robbers hiding in the forests near this barrio were caught whilst sleeping on straw mats (apli). They were then severely flogged and punished until they were left crawling (cadapa). * Caggao - Named after a parasite called cagaw, which once infested the place. * Luzong - This place was formerly three sitio: Pideng, Butak and Dalimuno. Quicksand in the area caused the disappearance of working animals, hence the name \\"Luzong\\", derived from the Ilocano word lusong (\\"stuck\\"). * Mar√≠a Cristina - It is said that a visiting American once asked the village's name from a beautiful girl. Thinking that the stranger was asking for her name, the maiden answered \\"Mar√≠a Cristina\\". * Mindoro - The name was derived from the Spanish Minas de oro (\\"gold mine\\"). At that time there were gold dust and nuggets in the river beside the village, and people used to pan these and sell them to the rich. General Alzate gave the village its present name. * Nagsabaran - This name (meaning \\"place where [the road] branches out\\") was given to the place because the national road branched out to this barrio. * Paratong - The old name was Libtong, which means \\"lagoon\\". During the Spanish Era, the prefix \\"lib\\" was changed into \\"para\\" which literally means \\"for\\". * Quintarong - Once named Daya ti Sabangan (\\"east of the mouth of the river\\"), the place was a reputed hideout of native pirates called tirong whom villagers often saw running after one another (kinnamat in Ilocano). * Reyna Regente - The village was named after a certain pre-Colonial queen who once ruled the area. Called Reyna Regente by later generations, it is said that she was ruthless. Her unnamed youngest daughter succeeded her, and unlike her mother was a wise and benevolent monarch. * Rissing - The old name Pa-o was taken from a big tree in the area; when and how it became Rissing is unknown. * San Blas - The place was named after a man who was reputedly known for his wisdom and was named after Saint Blaise. * San Cristobal - Named after the town's patron saint, Saint Christopher. * Sinapangan - Named after the sapang tree which grew abundantly in the place. * Ubbog - The term ubbog means \\"spring\\". Long ago, water would well up through the earth even with little effort. History 1700 marked the official foundation of Bangar under the patronage of Saint Christopher, when it became a mission field. However, Christianity was brought as early as the later part of 1500, when Bangar was still a visita (chapelry) of Tagudin, with a community of 2,800 inhabitants. The highly skilled, industrious and peace- loving people were primarily engaged in rice and cotton planting. The beautiful and sturdy handwoven products made by the women of that time even found their way to Europe and it was said that some of these materials were used as boat sails by European seamen. Among the more famous handwoven products made by them were blankets bearing different designs, clothing materials and mosquito nets. Since chemicals for coloring were very scarce those days, the bark of trees and fruit were used to dye those handwoven products. The old town was made of three pueblitos (small towns) namely: Villa-Cruz, San Rafael and San Anastacio. Near these pueblitos were small communities of Igorotes Infieles who paid tribute to the Governor. Through the Superior Decreto (Executive Decree) signed by Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco on March 2, 1850, the town of Bangar was made part of the newly created province of La Union. Prior to this, Bangar, Purao (Balaoan) and Namacpacan (Luna) were part of Ilocos Sur. As the years passed by, barrios were formed. Education during Spanish times consisted of learning the Cartilla and the abecedario. Roman Catholic religion was taught hand-in-hand with good manners. However, formal education was given to students belonging to the upper class. Spanish social life had greatly affected the Indios and in no time, Castilian manners were very evident among them. The social class of an individual was easily distinguished by the kind of attire one wore. Male peasants were distinguished by their simple camisa de chino and loose pants tied to the waist by braided strings. Female peasants wore simple loose blouses and ankle length skirts, with a camison, made from cotton fabric, worn underneath. The peasantry were usually barefooted, and if there was anything worn on the feet, it was the kammadang (wooden shoes) or a pair of slippers. Men of the upper class were distinguished by the barong and camisa de chino made of fine fabric, and trousers cut in the western style. He wore socks and leather shoes and on the head was a hat, which was usually plumed. A walking cane in various styles and colors and encased in gold, silver or bronze was indispensable. He never smoked without using a pipe. The upper class lady was very fastidious. She had her hair done in a brushed up coiffure. They curled their hair by using the stem of the papaya leaf and iron rod which was heated over burning charcoal. However, so much care was given using this method. Other women preferred to tie their hair in curls in the evening and untie it in the morning. Ladies wore the \\"Maria Clara\\" or the camisa with embroidered and stitched butterfly sleeves and matching panuelo. They used alfiler (pins) made of gold or silver. A comb called peineta, usually fan-shaped and encrusted with silver or gold, adorned their hair. The skirt, which was usually billowy, was made from very fine fabric from China. Underneath she wore a long camison and over it the nuagas. The outer skirt was still topped by beautiful imported lace. A perfumed fan and a big handkerchief trimmed with lace, hanging on the right side of the skirt tucked to her waistline, was part of the attire. On Sundays and holidays of obligation, a mantilla made of lace, which covered the head down to the waist and tucked to the hair by a gold pin was obligatory for the Holy Mass. On the feet, the lady wore a zapatilla, usually half-heeled and adorned with artificial rhinestones. A gold pendant hanging from a gold necklace around the neck was also part of the attire. The tamborine, a gold necklace with intricate designs was also worn on special days. US-styled education was implemented with the coming of the Americans in 1898. Education had a very high standard then, such that one who finished the fourth grade could teach those who were in the lower years. The impact of World War II was first felt in Bangar on December 8, 1941, the feast of the Immaculate Conception. A lantern competition, which was sponsored by Rev. Jose Brillantes, the parish priest, was hastily cancelled and church goers had to hurry home after the Holy Mass as they immediately prepared for evacuation. On December 20, 1941, the Japanese Army entered Bangar. They put up sentries along the national road and also had one at the Municipal building and another at the plaza. The Japanese occupation required all citizens to display and pin small Japanese flags outside the pocket of the shirt or blouse with the name of the holder written in Japanese. According to them, this was to distinguished peaceful citizens from guerrillas. Sometime in 1944, on the day Bangar was celebrating the birthday of Emperor Hirohito with a program at the town plaza, a truck load of Japanese soldiers arrived with a lone Filipino who was said to have been captured somewhere in Bacnotan. It was told that the Japanese took the Filipino behind the southern school building and ordered him to dig what was to be his own grave. Upon sensing that his hours on earth were counted, the Filipino suddenly grabbed and unsheathed the sword of an officer who was standing nearby and in one hit motion with the sword, the officer almost got beheaded. This stunned the Japanese soldiers and the Filipino was able to escape unhurt. The whole town was gripped in terror, since this would mean Japanese reprisals--on December 28, 1944, the Japanese burned many houses in the town proper and raided the camp of the guerrillas in barrio San Cristobal. The Underground Movement was very strong during the Japanese occupation of Bangar. Many residents joined the guerrillas, who had put up camps in San Cristobal. Further in the mountains at Lonoy, they also joined \\"Camp 121\\". Colonel Volkman and Major Agtarap led the guerrilla movement. The arms that were supplied to the guerrillas landed at Paraoir and men had to carry bolos at nighttime. The first Americans to reach Bangar during its liberation were a certain Captain Roberts with his men. During the Northern Luzon Campaign, Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and units of the 1st, 2nd, 12th, 13th, 15th and 16th Infantry Divisions and the USAFIP-NL 121st Infantry Regiment started the liberation campaign in Bangar in 1945 and helped guerrilla resistance fighters and the U.S. liberation forces against Japanese Imperial Army forces towards the end of the war. Today, Bangar is known for its handwoven cloth called abel and blacksmithing (panday). Its agricultural products include rice, corn, sugar cane, peanuts, sweet potatoes, vegetables, and Virginia tobacco. =Spanish-era curates of Bangar= * Rev Francisco de Alvear, OSA ‚Äì 1696-1698 * Rev Manuel Miranda, OP ‚Äì 1805-1809 * Rev Benito Tesauro, OSA ‚Äì 1853-1864 * Rev Evaresto Guadalupe, OSA ‚Äì 1866-1887 Demographics According to the , the population of Bangar, La Union, was people, with a density of .

History Luna was once called Namacpacan, which is an Ilocano word meaning \\"one who feeds\\". As early as 1587, Namacpacan was recorded as a visita (satellite mission, whose church is manned by non-resident clergy based in the cabecera) of Purao (now Balaoan). It was a settlement along the camino real (national road) from Vigan to Manila, and travellers stopped there to refresh themselves. Since restaurants was not yet in vogue, local families offered the travellers food and lodging, hence the name. On 18 October 1906, during the terms of Governor Joaquin Luna and Mayor Primitivo Resurrecci√≥n Novicio, the town was renamed \\"Luna\\" through Philippine Commission Act No. 1543. It was the first town that altered its name since the creation of the province in 1850. The change was to honour the famous Luna brothers: Revolutionary General Antonio and Spoliarium painter Juan; their mother, Do√±a Laureana Novicio Luna, was a native of Namacpacan.

Tourist attractions Baluarte, an old Spanish watch tower Luna is also known for its beaches, particularly in Nalvo Sur and Darigayos. Beach shades, cottages and resorts are found in these barangays. The municipality is also known for its native delicacies and pottery products which are comparable to San Juan's. The town is a pilgrimage site as it enshrines the Apo Baket Namacpacan, a wooden Marian image. On the beach of barangay Victoria rests the ruins of an old Spanish watch tower, locally named as Balauarte. The tower was intended to guard the shores of the town primarily from Muslim and pirate attacks during the Spanish period. During World War II, the tower served as the communication tower post for a temporary airfield for the USAFIP-NL forces. Due to years of quarrying within the site of the tower (1980 to 2000), the coastline receded and sea waves severely damaged the foundation of the tower, which eventually caused major damage to its structure. At present, efforts were initiated to preserve the tower from further damage. Education Luna has Public Elementary schools in each barangay. There are 6 public high schools (Luna National Science High School - Central in Barangay Barrientos, LNHS - Rimos and Cantoria Annex; and Oanari National High School) Bungro-Sucoc Integrated School in Bungro, Luna Technical Vocational High School and 1 Private High School (Santa Catalina Academy).

The sitio was the meeting place of both Christians and pagan Kankanaey settlers from nearby sitios to graze their cattle while playing the game. The name was later shortened to \\"burnotan\\". The wide plain and fertile soil attracted Christian and pagan settlers, who later intermarried which led to the increase in population. On April 19, 1897, a Roman Catholic priest Father Redondo established a church in the area and introduced the patron saint to be Saint Gabriel, from which the town was later named. In 1906, San Gabriel was made into a township under the sub-province of Amburayan in Mountain Province, with the first Presidente being Don Pablo Waggay. The township was converted into a municipal district of Amburayan in 1920, and into a municipality in 1922, following the settlement of a boundary dispute between La Union and Mountain Province. In 1947, San Gabriel was converted into a regular municipality by virtue of Executive Order No. 72 issued by President Manuel Roxas through the sponsorship of former House Speaker Pro-Tempore Francisco Ortega. Demographics In the , the population of San Gabriel, La Union, was people, with a density of . Economy San Gabriel is an agricultural town. In its early days, the people of San Gabriel were engaged mainly in highland farming as their means of livelihood. They produced rice, corn, sweet potatoes and other root crops. As years passed, crop production decreased due to massive soil erosion in the uplands. Nevertheless, the inhabitants decided to improve their farming techniques and started making terraces. The perseverance of the people in constructing rice terraces and irrigation system along the hills and mountains of San Gabriel caused agricultural productivity to rebound. Bananas and tiger grass (\\"Thysanolaena maxina\\") are also abundant in San Gabriel, which harvests materials for soft broom production on a weekly basis.

In 1582, San Juan was proclaimed a mission station under the authority of the Augustinian Order, as recorded by the Nueva Segovia Bi-centennial souvenir booklet dated April 25, 1587. By 1586 the town had become the center of the parish, and was renamed San Juan by the Augustinian Fathers after the Catholic Patron Saint of San Juan Bautista. The town boasted an Augustinian convent and a population of 6,000. Its first priest was Friar Agustin Ni√±o. The center of the parish was subsequently transferred to Bauang, with San Juan sometimes being an out- station (visita) of Bauang and sometimes of Bacnotan. In 1707 the Church of St. John the Baptist was constructed at San Juan. In 1772, the mission station was placed under the authority of the Dominican Order. In 1807, San Juan was established as a parish in its own right. On March 2, 1850, San Juan became part of the province of La Union, when the province was created by Governor- General Antonio Maria Blanco. In 1898 during the latter days of the Philippine Revolution, the whole of San Juan was razed to the ground by a great fire. With the demise of the church, convent and rectory, the church registers were destroyed, although subsequent registers from 1898 to 1917 do survive and have been microfilmed. Municipal birth registers were begun in 1922. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Father Mariano Gaerlan was appointed priest. He was a native of San Juan, the first Filipino priest for the town, and one of the \\"Nine Clerics\\" of Nueva Segovia who fought in the revolution. He also began the reconstruction of the church in 1902, which was completed under his successor, Father Eustaquio Ocampo. Another local resident, also named Mariano Gaerlan, wrote Biag ti Maysa a Lakay, Wenno Nakaam-ames a Bales (i.e., Life of an Old Man, or a Dreadful Revenge) under the pen-name of Batallador. The book was in the local Ilokano language and published in 1909. He was originally from Candon, Ilocos Sur where he also maintained a residence, and an aspiring politician who was never elected to public office. He had several children including Nieves Gaerlan who married Antonio \\"Matias\\" Aquino, a then Mayor of San Juan, and \\"Captain\\" Candonino Gaerlan, a guerrilla leader and Filipino war hero. From 1941 to 1945 San Juan was occupied by the invading Japanese forces during World War II. On January 19, 1942, Gaerlan co-led the first guerrilla ambush against Japanese forces in the Philippines, which was prosecuted on the southern outskirts of Candon. He was subsequently appointed commander of the Third Battalion of the 121st Infantry Regiment of the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines ‚Äì Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL). This regiment is often referred to as the La Union Infantry Regiment, and was commanded by \\"Captain\\" George M. Barnett. Gaerlan was killed and subsequently beheaded later that same year at San Juan, after he was betrayed by the local chief of police while visiting his sister. His head was stuffed into a jar of alcohol and displayed in the plazas of the towns en route to Candon. There the town mayor convinced the Japanese that this was in poor taste, and the container was thrown into a rice paddy west of the town.\\"Philippine Resistance in Candon, 1942\\" by Donald Chaput, Philippine Studies vol. 47, no. 1 (1999): 100‚Äì113. As the war progressed, crops and local services were destroyed. Food was in short supply. San Juan was liberated in 1945 by the soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary and the guerrilla units of the La Union Infantry Regiment during the Battle of San Fernando under Major Russell W. Volckmann on their way to meet the liberating forces of General Douglas MacArthur on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf. After the war, inflation led to the financial crisis of 1950 which was followed by the introduction of import controls. Subsequent government-sponsored irrigation systems and farm technicians led to a slow but assured recovery with increased productivity and profitability. Demographics In the , the population of San Juan, La Union, was people, with a density of . According to a local 1896 census, the population of San Juan was 10,510. At that time, there were twenty-eight barrios inhabited by 9,989 residents, and four rancherias inhabited by 521 \\"infieles\\" or non-Christians (Igorots). These barrios were Ili, Barraca, Panicsican, Talogtog, Sabangan, Taboc, Lubing, Sinapangan, Cacapian, Caculangan, Santa Rosa, Caaniyan, Oaquing, Catdongan, Caarusipan, Guinguinabang, Bugbugcao, Pacpacac, Legleg, Nadsaag, Capacuan, Bacnotan, Dasay, Al-langigan, Bombuneg, Balballosa, Duplas and San Felipe. The rancherias were Rancho de Locutan, Indang, Amontoc and Losoya. Yli, also known as Poblacion, had a population of 1,134 residents described as 2 \\"Espa√±oles peninsulares\\", 2 \\"Mestizos de espa√±ol\\", 1,122 \\"naturales\\" and 8 \\"Chinos\\".Estado del numero de habitantes existenses de este pueblo durante el expresion lo a√±o con expresion de razas, a√±o de 1896.

The word Samjhauta means \\"agreement\\", \\"accord\\" and \\"compromise\\" in both Hindi and Urdu. Until the reopening of the Thar Express, this was the only rail connection between the two countries. The train was started on 22 July 1976 following the Shimla Agreement and ran between Amritsar and Lahore, a distance of about 52 km. Following disturbances in Punjab in the late eighties, due to security reasons Indian Railways decided to terminate the service at Attari, where customs and immigration clearances take place. On 14 April 2000, in an agreement between Indian Railways and Pakistan Railways (PR), the distance was revised to cover just under three km. History An eralier train ran between Amritsar and Lahore and vice versa and carried 8,239 persons from India to Pakistan and 10,360 from Pakistan to India from 28 October 1954 to 30 November 1954. Samjhauta Express was a daily train when the service started in 1976 and changed to a bi-weekly schedule in 1994. Earlier the rakes were returned to the home country the same day but later in 2000 the rake remained overnight at that location. The train's first break of service was when it was discontinued on 1 January 2002 in the wake of the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament on 13 December 2001. Service resumed on 15 January 2004.

A spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office said that service was suspended \\"in view of the prevailing tensions between Pakistan and India\\" while it was reported that India has suspended the running of the train on its side, due to \\"drastic decline in occupancy\\" and \\"the suspension of services from across the border\\". On 8 August 2019, the service was suspended by Pakistan following the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu And Kashmir. Route Its termini are Lahore in Pakistan and Delhi in India. The border crossing takes place between Wagah in Pakistan and Attari in India. Originally, this was a through service with the same rake going all the way between the termini; later the Pakistani rake stopped at Attari at which point passengers had to change trains. Now there is a train from Delhi to Attari where all passengers alight for customs and immigration. This train does not have any commercial stops between Delhi and Attari. It is incorrectly referred to as the Samjhauta Express and it is officially known as the Delhi-Attari or Attari-Delhi Express. The actual Samjhauta Express runs from Attari to Lahore, although the passengers are checked at Wagah, the first station on the Pakistani side. The train service was set up with an agreement between Indian Railways (IR) and Pakistan Railways (PR) to alternately use an Indian and a Pakistani rake and locomotive for the train, six months at a time. The train usually has between four and eight coaches. The rake supplied by Pakistan is usually hauled by an Alco DL-543 class ALU20 diesel loco (Lahore shed), with the entire train in the standard dark green livery of PR. Incidents =2007 bombing= In the early hours of 19 February 2007, 70 people (mostly Pakistani civilians and a few Indian military guarding the train) were killed and scores more injured in a terrorist attack on the Delhi - Attari Express.Zee News - Passengers recount horror on blast-hit train The attack occurred at Diwana station near the Indian city of Panipat, Haryana. Officials found evidence of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), (RDX) containing Fragmentation (weaponry) and flammable material, including three unexploded IEDs. The National Investigation Agency suspected that the blasts were masterminded by Swami Aseemanand, which was dismissed later for lack of evidence. On 1 July 2009, the US Department of Treasury designated Arif Qasmani of the Lashkar-e Tayyiba as a person involved in terrorism, citing among other things his involvement in the Samjhauta Express bombing.\\"Arif Qasmani is the chief coordinator for Lashkar-e Tayyiba's (LET) dealings with outside organizations and has provided significant support for LET terrorist operations.

He had taken help from his friend Sandeep Dange, an engineering graduate and has done higher study in physics, and Ramji Kalsangra, an electrician, to build the improvised explosive devices used in the blasts. On 8 January 2011, Aseemanand allegedly confessed the bombing of Samjhauta express, a statement later found to be obtained under duress.Swami Aseemanand 'confessed' under duress Times of India - 10 January 2011 Later the Hindu nationalist group RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) sent a legal notice to CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) accusing it of deliberately leaking Swami Aseemanand's confession in the media.

In May 2004, it was announced that former One Life to Live actress Gina Tognoni would step into the role of Dinah.http://soapcentral.com/gl/news/2004/0503-tognoni.php She debuted in the role in July 2004.

Storylines Vanessa gave birth to Dinah at the age of seventeen in 1970 and felt she was incapable of being a good mother to her newborn at the time. With no one to turn to for help, she gave Dinah up for adoption and was reassured that her child would be adopted by a great family who would love and care for her. Dinah would have to endure a turbulent childhood and when she was reunited with her biological parents in her teenage years, the hurt and resentment she felt towards Ross and Vanessa for giving her up as a baby made it hard to forgive them. Vanessa especially received the brunt of Dinah's wrath when she learnt her mother had placed her for adoption without Ross even knowing about her existence. After her initial adoptive parents (John and Melissa Carter) were killed in a car accident, her adoptive uncle, the late Gordon Matthews (Melissa's brother) placed her at the Little Angels Foundling Home in Springfield. In time, she would be placed with a foster family the Morgans who also took in another girl, Adele, whom Dinah became very close to. She ran away from the Morgans and found a new foster family, the Kowalskis, that worked at a carnival, but 1986, Dinah was tired of the carnival life and left for Springfield to find her long lost foster sister, Adele. Eventually, Adele (now known as Dorie Smith) and Dinah would be reunited thanks to Phillip Spaulding's help. Dorie would go on to be adopted by India von Halkein and Dinah moved into the von Halkein residence as well. Though still resentful of him, she accepted Ross faster than Vanessa and moved in with her father eventually. Although she could hardly be civil to her mother. On the romantic front, Dinah became involved with Cameron Stewart who would break her heart when he had an affair with Lacey Bauer (Johnny's younger sister) on the side. Hurt, she turned to Alan-Michael Spaulding. Her relationship with her mother was further strained when Vanessa discovered her teenage daughter was socialising with alcoholics at wild parties thanks to her new boyfriend's influence. Whilst on a motorcycle tour with Alan-Michael one night, her boyfriend accidentally collided with Frank Cooper's car. Frank was on his way to the hospital so his pregnant kid sister, Harley Cooper, could give birth. With no way to get to Cedars on time, Dinah delivered Harley's newborn whom the latter would name Daisy. Dinah and Harley became fast friends and the former would be there for emotional support when Harley gave Daisy up for adoption. Meanwhile, Ross and Vanessa had reunited and although Dinah was happy about that, her parents ended up separating again. Later, when Vanessa was about to leave for Venezuela, Dinah and Ross said their goodbyes and mother and daughter finally reunited. In 1988, Dinah suspected George and his criminal partner, Nicky Sutton of smuggling drugs in cars through Frank's garage. Although she tried to tell Cam, he refused to believe her and pushed her away. As for Cam, he made up with his father but, one day, he witnessed George with Nicky at Spaulding Enterprises and finally realized that George had not changed as he claimed. One day, when Dinah was alone in the Stewart house with George, she tried to get George to leave Cam alone. George getting angry with Dinah and nearly acting on his sexual obsession with the under aged Dinah came after her and nearly raped her. Fortunately Cam was visiting Ross, and Cam realized that Dinah was at his house with his father and not at Ross's as Dinah had led to believe. Cam and Ross raced over to the Stewart house and got George to stop before Dinah was raped. Springfield P.D. Lt. Larry Wyatt tried to get Cam and Dinah to see that it was not wise for them to set up George, but both of the teens refused to listen, but Lt. Wyatt got Cam and Dinah to agree to let him be nearby when George was arrested. On the day Rusty was arresting Nicky, George ran from Nicky and back home with the last drug buy that George was going to make from the man. Cam and Dinah on a tip from Rose McClaren came home with Lt. Wyatt waiting right outside and when George came home he first started abusing both Cam and Dinah until the bag of coke he bought from Nicky came falling out of his pocket onto the kitchen floor. Lt. Wyatt came in and arrested George right on the spot. Meanwhile, Alan-Michael had enough of Dinah being involved with Cam's personal problems and he and Dinah broke up. So Dinah and Cam were free and got involved again. Not long after, Dinah and Cam were surprised to learn of Alan-Michael and Harley's engagement. In February 1989 Dinah departed Springfield to go to college in Paris and Cameron followed her. Dinah (now Wendy Moniz) returned to Springfield in 1995 a changed woman, sophisticated and spoiled from living in Europe. Although Ross and Vanessa thought she was on break from school, they were shocked to discover that she had dropped out. While Dinah tried to pass herself off as a wealthy debutant, Ross's new wife, Blake, and Henry suspected that Dinah was in fact broke. While staying at Vanessa's, Dinah alienated herself from Vanessa's fianc√©, Matt Reardon, by flirting with him. Days later, Dinah was shocked when she came across an old acquaintance named Viktor Pasternak. As Dinah was telling Viktor about her money problems, she mentioned that her grandfather has a huge trust fund, but she will not receive a penny of it until she is married. However, Viktor had a plan. That same day, Vanessa learned of Dinah's money woes and since Dinah's flirtatious ways were grating on Matt, she suggested that Dinah live with Ross and Blake. Although Blake was not happy about the situation, she caved in and let Dinah move into the carriage house. However, like Matt, Blake did not totally trust Dinah either and decided to find out what her new stepdaughter was up to. For Blake her plan was not totally successful; not only could not she make out who Dinah was speaking with, while she listened in on her, but Dinah caught on and starting speaking in code with Viktor. As Dinah continued to annoy Blake with her smoking and general selfishness, she had her parents, especially Ross, were wrapped around her little finger. Meanwhile, Dinah had found a perfect way to get money--she had arranged for Viktor to kidnap her and they would split the ransom money. For Dinah, Viktor double crossed her and left her tied up while he decided to ask for more money (which he would keep for himself. The family received Viktor's ransom demand and Matt convinced everyone that he had taken the money to the location Viktor had mentioned. Knowing that Dinah's life was in danger. When Matt left the briefcase at the specified location near the railroad tracks for Viktor, instead of going back home, he instinctively went to the abandoned underground factory and found Dinah there tied up and gagged. He immediately released her gag, while Viktor found the money and headed back to the abandoned factory. Viktor arrived just as Matt was almost done untying the rope around Dinah's hands. Viktor got away but was later caught when trying to fly out of Springfield. Ross and Vanessa were extremely disappointed in their daughter for her behavior and her scheming ways. Angry at her parents, Dinah lashed out by sleeping with the town villain, Roger Thorpe, who was Blake's father. In an effort to get Roger away from their daughter, Ross and Vanessa used Roger's visitation rights for Peter (since he was Peter's grandfather) as a weapon. Livid at their using Peter, Roger vowed to find his son, Hart, and tell him about Peter (since he had no idea he fathered a child) and then use him to get custody of Peter. Roger eventually found Hart and when strain in Roger's marriage to Dinah emerged, Hart got Dinah to sleep with him and then gleefully revealed the fact to his enraged dad. Little did anyone realize that Roger had been busy embezzling all of Dinah's trust fund money. While trying to patch things up with Dinah, his lawyer and confidante, former DA Leo Flynn, was \\"doctoring\\" his financial books to make it look like Roger had lost the money in a bad investment, it was actually stashed away in the Cayman Islands. When he was about to have to go to court to reveal what he had done with the money, Roger took some pills and faked a heart attack to dodge court. His ploy nearly worked; Dinah almost fell back into Roger's grasp, but Hart learned that his father had stolen Dinah's money and showed Dinah the proof. Already angry with Roger for his thievery, Dinah got worse when she was told Roger had faked his heart attack. She bought a gun and went into Roger's hospital room with the intention of killing him. Luckily, Hart dragged her off before she pulled the trigger. The two conducted a plan to make Roger believe he was losing his mind. Dinah decided not to divorce Roger and then she and Hart did all kinds of things to make Roger question his mental faculties. Roger did not realize what was happening because he thought Dinah and Hart hated each other and that she was an airhead. For him, Dinah and Hart began to fall in love. It was a slow process, but it drove Roger mad and violent. He attacked Hart several times, choked Dinah with a scarf, began drugging Dinah and tried to convince her to kill herself while on it. Hart eventually caught on to his father's malevolent plot and saved Dinah. Now, they both decided to kick their plan into high gear. Hart confronted Roger at Laurel Falls with a vial of the drugs and threatened to the police Roger had been trying to drive his wife insane in an effort to cover up the fact he robbed her blind ever since he had married her. A fearful Roger pulled a gun on Hart and the two struggled. The gun went off and Hart was shot. A despondent Roger, believing he had \\"murdered\\" his own son, buried Hart. However, this was merely part of the clever plot against him; Hart was not dead, the bullet had been a blank and he had been wearing a blood pack. Roger's mental state dramatically declined and got worse after he accidentally drank an entire vial of the drugs he had been poisoning Dinah with. The drug was pumped out of his system, but he was left strapped down to a hospital bed after he had tried to strangle Dinah. Finally, at a fair, Hart revealed himself to Roger in front of the entire town. A whacked-out Roger could not believe his eyes and admitted to everyone that he had shot Hart. Suddenly after Dinah refused to corroborate Roger's story, he realized he had been set up all along and attacked his son. It took two cops to subdue him and Roger was eventually sent to a mental institution. After learning Dinah had retrieved her money from the Cayman Islands, Roger set out to escape the mental hospital and prove he had been set up. After escaping, he then disguised himself and broke into Hart's apartment and found a picture of Hart and Dinah together in the Caymans, disproving their claim they hated each other and validating his argument they had been in collusion all along. Bridget Reardon (fearing that Hart, the father of her child, might go to jail) switched photos and when Roger showed it to the judge, it was really a picture of Peter. Roger was carted back off to the loony bin. After a failed escape attempt, Dinah authorized the psychiatrists to give Roger \\"shock treatment\\" to cure him of violent impulses. At a second competency hearing, Hart and Dinah were discovered together and a \\"kind, benevolent\\" Roger, he had never undergone the shock therapy and was pretending, was finally released from the mental hospital. Dinah got a surprise visit from her old lover from France, Jean-Luc. Jean Luc and Dinah had lived together for two years and he told Hart that he regretted kicking her out and wanted her back. Dinah told him that she would handle him. She told Jean Luc that she was still mad at him for throwing her out and that they were together a long time ago. She was a different person now. Upon learning that Hart and Dinah were engaged, Jean Luc jokingly inquired how many fianc√©es this makes for Dinah and told Hart that love did not last with Dinah no matter whom she was with. Although Dinah and Hart thought Jean Luc's appearance in Springfield was innocent, he was actually paid by Roger to break up the couple. To succeed in his goal, Jean Luc visited Dinah again and pledged his love for her. When she rejected him by pointing out that he had been interested in her only for her money, and that he had dumped her previously, Jean Luc merely reminisced about the good days with her. Jean Luc pointed out that she would eventually tire of the farm and that a girl like her could never make a man like Hart happy for long. However, things between Dinah and Hart would get worse without Jean Luc's help. It soon became obvious that Dinah was insecure of her role in Hart's life and was not quite the type of woman to stay on the farm. Things got tenser after a trip to Switzerland, where Jean Luc arranged for Dinah to be reunited by her jet-setting friends. Although Dinah was enjoying herself, it was apparent that Hart was not and he was further dismayed when her friends followed her to Springfield. Not understanding how Dinah could have such shallow friends, Hart confided his frustrations to Bridget, which only fueled Dinah's jealousy. Finally, fearing she was about to lose Hart, Dinah agreed to tell her friends that they had to leave. Believing Jean Luc's words that Hart was trying to turn her into a domestic type, Dinah made a turnaround and refused to tell her friends to leave. Although she and Hart tried to settle their differences, she kept finding herself drawn to the jet-setting life and finally the couple decided they were incompatible and broke up in 1997. Her mother had mysteriously died but was later found alive and well; she had been battling an illness and when told that passing on the illness was a possibility, Dinah began to have second thoughts about having children with Hart, whom she had eventually reunited with, something that did not please him. When Dinah continued to have doubts about having children, despite Hart's having learned from Vanessa's doctor that the possibility was slight, it became apparent that perhaps Dinah just did not want to have children. Although she later agreed to \\"let nature take its course\\", Dinah secretly began taking birth control pills. In the meantime, Dinah was becoming increasingly jealous of Hart's new friend--Cassie Layne, an ex-stripper who was trying to raise money to get her daughter out of foster care. Dinah eventually lost Hart, due to her meddling in Cassie's quest to get her daughter back. Dinah started obsessing with finding a way to win him back, alienating herself from her family. Knowing that Hart could not resist the maternal-type, Dinah borrowed a baby and set it up so Hart would see her caring for a child. Her plan worked with Hart believing that Dinah had changed and they reconciled. Later, Dinah was devastated when Hart broke their engagement saying that he no longer loved her. Making matters worse was the fact that Vanessa sympathized with Cassie and told Dinah that she needed to move on with her life. Afterwards, Dinah decided to focus her energies on getting Hart back. Having found Cassie's ex-husband, Rob, at a halfway house in Chicago, Dinah asked him to come to Springfield to help break-up Cassie and Hart. Dinah further enticed him with the concept that she had help him get custody of Tammy, Cassie's daughter. When her plans did not work, she accused Cassie of having an affair with Josh. At the same time, Dinah became convinced that Cassie was keeping a secret, along with Vanessa's doctor, Michael Burke, and decided to find out what exactly Cassie was up to. Dinah broke into Michael's apartment to see what she could find. While she could not find anything, it was apparent that Cassie was keeping a secret from Hart and that was damaging their relationship. One day, a drunken Hart showed up at Dinah's doorstep and she took advantage of the situation by telling him later that they had made love. Later, she then slept with Rob so that she would become pregnant. The plan worked and Dinah told Hart that she was pregnant with his child. Marcus, a friend, who figured out what Dinah had done, tried to convince her to do the right thing; she was obsessed with getting Hart back and went along with the lie. After having a slight scare, Dinah lied to Hart that she was having a troubled pregnancy. Pleased when Hart vowed to stay by Dinah during her pregnancy, ultimately Cassie would not leave Hart. Wanting to put a cramp in their relationship, Dinah gave Hart an ultimatum, either her and the baby or Cassie. Cassie soon learned of Dinah and Rob's tryst. Dinah later was able to bribe the doctor to convince Hart that a test was too dangerous. Tragically, days after learning that Cassie herself was pregnant, Dinah miscarried: while sneaking around by the farm, she was accidentally hit by a door by Hart, who wanted to see who was trespassing. She then used his guilt as well as her mother's blood pressure pills to con him into staying with her. Later, when she became ill from over-medicating herself, she conned Hart into marrying her by claiming to be dying. Although the plan worked, Hart was still drawn to Cassie, who had decided to lie to Hart by claiming the child she was carrying was not his. Determined to keep Hart with her, Dinah set fire to the farm. The fire left Dinah with terrible scars on her face, which made Hart feel more responsible to her. However, Hart was shocked when he overheard Dinah and Vanessa talking and discovered that he was the father of Cassie's baby. Though Dinah tried to convince him that she kept the truth from him because she loved him and wanted him to stay, he did not buy it and left her. Although Vanessa again implored Dinah to get professional help, Dinah insisted that all she needed was Hart. Thinking her sister was picking her up, Cassie got into the car only to find Dinah behind the wheel. Dinah then locked the doors and drove into a snowstorm, ranting about how Cassie's ruined her life. Worked up Dinah, skidded into a snow bank and the car got stuck. Just then, Cassie started to go into labor but Dinah did not believe her. Frantic, Cassie called Hart on his cell phone and he headed into the storm to find her. Angry, Dinah moved off telling Cassie to let Hart save her. However, Dinah returned to the car, realized that Cassie was serious and the baby may not make it without her help. So, Dinah acted and delivered the baby. Just then Hart arrived, thrilled and relieved to find Cassie and see his son for the first time. Totally unbalanced by now, Dinah got angry with Hart for rejecting her and retaliated by breaking into his room at the Springfield Inn. Desperate to hold on to Hart, Dinah finally revealed the lengths she had gone to keep him - taking Vanessa's pills, which almost killed her, and starting the fire that scarred her. Shocked, Hart called Vanessa, telling her to get her daughter. That day, Dinah freaked out when Vanessa mentioned having her committed, and she called her father to come help her. Dinah then moved in with her father, Ross. However, although she was able to fool him into thinking she was alright, it was clear that Hart was not out of her system. Then Cassie learned the truth about the child Dinah miscarried, and knowing that that was her only link to Hart, Dinah tried to appeal to Cassie. When that did not work, she grabbed the one antique gun Hart left behind. Dinah aimed the antique gun at Cassie, who plead with Dinah to realize that Hart would find out Laura was not his baby one way or another. At that moment, Hart walked in and jumped in front of Cassie as Dinah pulled the trigger. He was critically wounded, and as a devastated Dinah fled to her mother for help, Cassie had Hart rushed to the hospital. Vanessa was devastated by what her daughter did and wanted Dinah to explain the accidental shooting to the police but Dinah insisted that she would kill herself first, and Vanessa decided to hide her. Before leaving, a desperate Dinah went to Cedars to see Hart. As he was going into cardiac arrest, Dinah confronted him and shook him in her attempt to convince him that the shooting was accidental. As machines started to go off, Dinah debated whether to stay with Hart or save herself. She wound up fleeing as doctors arrived to revive Hart and ran smack into Matt in the hospital parking garage. Matt grabbed Dinah and planned to turn her in, but backed down when Dinah revealed that her mother would never forgive him. Days later, Vanessa arranged for Dinah to fly to Switzerland where the nuns who took care of her during her illness would help Dinah disappear. After mother and daughter shared a heartfelt good-bye, Dinah fled Springfield. There would be no word about Dinah until the summer of 2000 when she contacted her mother saying that she needed help: she was pregnant. Dinah was mentioned in June 2002 when Ross saw Vanessa at Josh and Reva Lewis's wedding. Curiously there was no mention of her having had a baby. The truth about what Dinah had been doing would come to light in the summer of 2004 when Cassie discovered that a mysterious woman, in Europe, was using her credit cards. The mystery became even more intriguing when she realized the woman was posing as Princess Cassandra Winslow, herself. Not long after, Jeffrey O'Neill, the Springfield D.A., tracked Dinah (now Gina Tognoni) down and warned her that he would prosecute her if she continued impersonating Cassie. Far from being concerned, Dinah instead flirted with Jeffrey, bringing to mind when they met two years ago--when he rescued Dinah (who had miscarried her baby) who was languishing in a European prison. But Jeffrey's rescue had a price--in exchange she had to help him, by impersonating her old rival Cassie, who to Dinah's utter shock, was now married to an actual Prince, Richard Winslow, a dead-ringer for Jeffrey. Cassie was eventually widowed and living in Springfield, where Jeffrey now lived as well. Although Jeffrey thought that he had scared Dinah, but she continued masquerading as the Princess. After Cassie almost caught her, Dinah decided to go back to Springfield, in disguise since she was still wanted for Hart's murder. In Springfield, Dinah contacted Ross, who urged Dinah to turn herself in, which she did. Soon Dinah made her way to the Jessup farm where she came face to face with Hart's son, R.J. Introducing herself as his imaginary friend, she convinced the boy to keep her existence a secret. In the meantime, Dinah offered Edmund a deal to work together and ensure that Jeffrey never got too close to Cassie. Dinah admitted she had her sights set on Jeffrey and against his better judgment, Edmund created an alliance with her. Later, Dinah secretly called Jeffrey to convince him she was still safe and sound in Europe. However, when he learned that a mysterious person was stalking Cassie, even trying to kill her. Jeffrey continued to hunt for Dinah, finally finding her in Bill's apartment. He tried to threaten her into leaving town, again but she broke down his defenses and the pair almost wound up making love. Soon after, Dinah began actively stalking Cassie. Yet, Jeffrey kept quiet, instead trying to handle Dinah himself and urging her to give up her obsessive vendetta against Cassie. Deciding to get rid of Dinah once and for all, Jeffrey put her on a plane to Europe under guard, however, Dinah bribed a lookalike to take her place while she stayed in Springfield. Things finally came to a head one stormy night at the Jessup farm. Upon arriving at the barn, Dinah spotted Edmund knocking Jeffrey out with a shovel. The blow caused Jeffrey, who was holding a candle to fall, and the barn went up in flames. Edmund was able to drag Jeffrey to safety, while unbeknownst to them, Cassie entered the burning barn and spotted RJ trapped at the top level. Cassie became trapped under falling debris, but Dinah saved the day by rescuing RJ and alerting Edmund and Jeffrey to Cassie. Dinah was finally caught and sent to jail for Hart's death. The key witness was Cassie. As the sole witness to the shooting, if Cassie stated that Dinah was not in sound mind during the shooting--then Dinah would go free. Hoping to facilitate her release, Dinah tried to convince both Cassie and Blake that she was truly remorseful about Hart's death. Although Blake remained convinced that Dinah should stay behind bars, Cassie decided it was not worth the emotional rigors and stated that Hart's shooting was an accident. Dinah, despite being warned to forget about Cassie and move on with her life, decided to take from Cassie what was taken from her. So, deciding to steal Edmund away from Cassie, Dinah set it up so he would spot her drunkenly attempting to strip in a bar. Trying to avoid her making a scene, Edmund found her and dragged her out. Confronted by Edmund, Dinah turned on the tears and bemoaned to Edmund that she did not know how to change. As she had hoped, Edmund softened toward her and let her spend the night in his hotel suite. Meanwhile, Dinah continued to fuel Edmund's jealousy of Jeffrey by setting it up so he would see a picture of Jeffrey (as Richard) with Cassie in Jeffrey's apartment. Dinah gained the trust of Cassie's daughter, Tammy. She then gave Tammy her car keys and suggested that she go away to think. With Tammy gone, Dinah decided to play with Cassie's head and, disguising her voice, informed Cassie that Tammy was trying to get a job as a stripper in Chicago. She then informed Jeffrey that she told Tammy to go to Chicago, setting it up so the two could leave together. Although the pair failed to find Tammy, Dinah's machinations further drove a wedge between Cassie and Edmund because Cassie continually relied on Edmund. Dinah then seduced Jeffrey, but he discovered her true motive for the seduction when he found out that she had poked holes in his condom. Realizing this was all about getting pregnant so she could have a life like Cassie's, Jeffrey blasted Dinah and threw her out. Dinah initially taunted him by implying that she was pregnant, but was later devastated to learn that she was not. By the end of the year, Dinah was more jealous than ever of Cassie's impending marriage to Edmund and sought to destroy it by suggesting to R.J. that he saw Edmund hit Jeffrey over the head the night of the fire. That night, RJ told Jeffrey, who went to Dinah for confirmation. Dinah confirmed what she had seen and then encouraged Jeffrey to tell Cassie what he had learned. In 2005, Dinah was pleasantly surprised to see Cassie's trouble- making nephew Jonathan Randall head up to Cassie's room at the Beacon. Figuring that Cassie was setting Jonathan up (so his mother would see him taking advantage of an \\"inebriated\\" Cassie), Dinah put a wrench in her plans by first hanging a Do Not Disturb sign outside Cassie's door and then kept Reva from going up to Cassie's room with a story about calling Edmund to the hotel. The next morning, the day of Cassie and Edmund's wedding, Dinah summoned Edmund to the hotel. By the time Edmund got to Cassie's room, Jonathan had slipped out. However, thanks to Jonathan's drugging of Cassie and implying that they had slept together, a shaken Cassie almost did not attend her own wedding. In the meantime, Dinah distressed Bill by admitting to him that she was in love with Edmund. After learning that Edmund and Cassie did marry, a devious Dinah revealed to Edmund that she knew the reason why Cassie nearly did not make it to the altar. Although she was just teasing him with the information, without giving him any, Edmund was intrigued. Meanwhile, Dinah was pleased when Blake informed her that she had dropped the restraining order against her, out of gratitude for not ruining Cassie's wedding day. However, Dinah was still intent on breaking up the happy couple and decided to help fuel Edmund's growing jealousy by anonymously sending Cassie flowers. Bill was still concerned about Dinah's obsession over Edmund and his wife. Knowing that Cassie and Edmund were trying to get pregnant, it did not take long for Dinah to start pumping Corey, an OB-GYN who was a blind date, for information on modern fertility methods. Though Dinah tried to get her hands on some fertility drugs, she ended up being caught by Corey. Later, Dinah piqued Jonathan's interest when she told him about the fire in the barn. Eventually, Cassie figured out that Dinah knew what happened the night before her wedding and after a confrontation, the two got into a catfight that was broken up by Ross. Days later, after being accused of setting a small fire to the barn (Jonathan had done it), Dinah finally told Edmund what she knew about Jonathan and Cassie. Angry beyond belief, Edmund raced off to confront Jonathan while Dinah went and told Cassie what Edmund knew. Although Cassie came face to face with Edmund's violent side when she saw him beating up Jonathan, she still stayed loyal to him. At the same time, in celebration of what they thought would be the end of Cassie and Edmund's marriage, Dinah and Jonathan became lovers. They then hatched another plan to destroy the Winslow marriage by telling Cassie's sister, Reva, about Edmund causing the fire, hoping Reva would tell Cassie. Very soon after, Ross, Blake, Bill, and a visiting Matt staged an intervention to convince Dinah to leave town. That only succeeded in alienating Dinah from everyone when she became convinced that their motivation was to protect Cassie. Days later, the Winslow family was dealt a devastating blow when Cassie finally learned that Edmund had been responsible for the barn fire. With Edmund vulnerable, Dinah convinced him to let her carry his and Cassie's embryo (which had been frozen and was ready for implementation), convincing him that it would help him get Cassie back. Although he was skeptical of her motives, despite her insistence that she was trying to redeem herself, when Edmund learned that Cassie was leaving him, he desperately agreed to the plan. To cover himself legally, Edmund had Dinah sign a contract stating that she would voluntarily give up the child at birth. He then invited Dinah to stay at the farm so he could take care of her. Although Dinah tried to get closer to Edmund by offering him tips on how to win back Cassie, all her efforts only reminded her of the sacrifice she was making. Dinah finally informed Cassie that she was pregnant with her and Edmund's baby. Although sickened with the revelation that her hated rival was pregnant with her child, Cassie had no choice but to accept the situation. However, she refused to reunite with Edmund. During the surrogacy, Dinah was determined to make Edmund fall in love with her. When she miscarries the baby, she continues to pretend she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Cassie showers Dinah with kindness out of gratitude for carrying her child. Extremely uncomfortable, Dinah wanted to tell Cassie the truth, but Edmund kept putting it off. Finally one night Edmund convinced Dinah that they should simply disappear without ever telling Cassie the truth. He convinced Dinah to record a goodbye message to Ross. After recording the message, Dinah suddenly heard the sound of a baby crying. Edmund immediately covered her mouth with a chloroform rag and she fell to the floor, unconscious. When she awoke, Dinah found herself being held captive in an exact replica of the Jessup farmhouse. She then came face to face with Edmund. After railing at him for setting her up and leaving her alone, Dinah was shocked when he cruelly told her that everything went according to plan and he and Cassie will soon be reunited. He leaves Dinah there, devastated and trapped. Having just read that Michelle Bauer lost her baby in a car accident, Dinah realized that Edmund had stolen Michelle's baby and given it to Cassie. Later, Dinah swiped Edmund's cell phone and later used it to call Cassie. was with Cassie when her phone starts to ring and he answered the call first and covered. Dinah finally tried to reason with Edmund and convince him that his plan would not work, to which Edmund refused to listen. Dinah repeatedly tried to escape Edmund but failed each time. At the same time, Jonathan was shocked to learn that Dinah's baby was born, since he knew she miscarried. Concerned about Dinah, he followed Edmund and found himself outside the recreated farmhouse where Edmund was keeping Dinah. Jonathan was later called away. Unnerved by his close call, Edmund threatened to stop giving Dinah food if she did not find a way to deter Jonathan. So Dinah sent him off with a note to Jonathan that would throw him off her trail. Worried that she would not get out alive, Dinah decided to trick Edmund by hiding in a crevice in the farmhouse. Her plan worked, for when Edmund returned he could not find her. Instead of just leaving the door unlocked as Dinah thought he would, a panicked Edmund locked it behind him and later set fire to it. At the same time, Dinah had stolen Edmund's cell phone again and was using it to call Cassie, unaware that the place was on fire. Although she got through, the signal was lost. Then suddenly realizing a fire was raging around her, she tried to get out but was overcome by the smoke and passed out. Luckily, Detective A.C. Mallet, who had been investigating Edmund happened by and rescued her. Noticing her attention on the cell phone, he pressed redial and got in touch with Cassie, telling her he had found the missing Dinah. That night, Dinah was taken to Cedars where she apologized to Cassie for all she had done. Then in an act of atonement, she took baby Hope and gave her to her rightful father--Danny Santos. After the ordeal with Edmund ended, Dinah began a relationship with Mallet, who was pegged with keeping an eye on her. He stopped her from shooting Edmund. Although she was definitely attracted to Mallet, Dinah had been burned too many times by men and resolved to swear off them. It took some time but eventually a bond formed between the two and they became lovers Soon after, in 2006, Dinah became increasingly insecure about Mallet's feelings for Harley, his ex-wife. It did not help that Mallet would frequently drop everything to help Harley who was distraught over the fact that Gus was missing. Despite being jealous, Dinah was determined to be a supportive friend to Harley. Later, Mallet shocked Dinah by asking her to move in with him. Still not secure, a wary Dinah asked if this was his way of telling Harley that he is tired of being her back-up guy. Mallet spoke from his heart, telling Dinah how much she meant to him. Dinah was moved and they made love. The next day, Dinah and Mallet had a small dinner party where they announced the news. However, the occasion was marred when Mallet got a call from Harley and rushed out to help her. Mallet gave Dinah some horrible news‚ÄîRoss's private plane lost contact shortly after take-off and crashed. It was discovered that Ross was traveling with his female assistant, Nicole Landers. Immediately suspecting her father was having an affair, Dinah ranted about him abandoning his wife and children to go to Washington DC. She was only silenced when Blake slapped her face and yelled at Dinah to not speak about her father that way. Dinah returned to make peace, stating that her half-siblings are all she had left of her father. Dinah begged Blake not to shut her out. Blake told her that what she said about her father was true, but they were never to speak about it again. Dinah and Mallet would eventually become engaged. Vanessa was certain that Dinah had finally grown up and met the man of her dreams, but Matt was extremely skeptical that this wedding was ever going to happen and made that abundantly clear to Vanessa, Dinah and Mallet. When Mallet pressed Matt about his negative attitude, Matt stated that Dinah was the most self-destructive person he had ever met. However, when an upset Dinah professed her love for Mallet and vowed that she would not mess this up, Matt apologized for letting the past color his feelings. Vanessa also apologized for pressuring her about the details but stated that she wanted the wedding to be perfect. Her choice of words got Dinah angry and she blurted out that her wedding would not be perfect, especially since her father could not walk her down the aisle. At that point, Matt surprised her by offering to do it, with Vanessa offering to hang on her other arm. But the wedding went on hold after Dinah, who had an argument with Mallet, supposedly set the Beacon ablaze and Mallet was seriously injured. Mallet confronted Dinah and begged her to admit that she started the fire. Dinah confessed the truth about the fire. Realizing that Jeffrey O'Neill had the charges dropped to get Dinah under his thumb, Mallet tried to convince her that they could fight the charges since it was an accident. However, Dinah refused to take the risk of going back to prison and warned him if he told anyone what she did, she would deny it. She then told him to let their relationship go. Soon after, word got out about Dinah and Jeffrey's meetings because Blake approached Dinah to persuade Dinah that losing Mallet would be a mistake since he was so much like Ross. Dinah saw through her act and accused Blake of wanting Jeffrey all to herself. After Mallet and Dinah both flirted with other people, Mallet finally carried Dinah off so they could talk. As their song began to play, along with slides of their past, Mallet admitted to Dinah that he wanted to marry her; she agreed. They decided to get married right then and there, until Dinah came face to face with Jeffrey. Jeffrey informed Dinah that his cohorts at the government wanted to ruin him, but eventually Dinah would be exonerated and the two would marry. In the last episode, Mallet and Dinah got back together and possibly married. Dinah volunteers at a hospital and finds an injured soldier who calls her out on helping others to make herself feel better about her life. Annoyed Dinah paces, irritated at the soldier's suggestion. Dinah resolves to help him one way or another, but he slaps her hand away as he struggles with his wheelchair. Later, Dinah finds her crippled soldier starting a fight at a bar and stares at him in disbelief. He does not seem to care when Dinah mentions that the other man in the fight could have killed him. Dinah tells him that she is from Springfield. He angrily wheels himself away as he tells her to remind him not to visit. After he leaves, Dinah finds a watch on the floor and realizes who it belongs to. The soldier talks to the military officer and it becomes clear that the soldier is Shayne Lewis. However, Dinah does not know this. Shayne arrives back in Springfield in December. He does not tell anyone that he is in town until the day of Marina and Mallet's Wedding. Shayne then picks a fight with Mallet. Since Dinah and Shayne's first meeting, they became closer. On August 3, 2009, Dinah married Joshua \\"Shayne\\" Lewis.

Background The song's melody is very similar to the old Russian song Po Donu gulyaet kazak molodoi (Young Cossack went near the Don). The song is a report of a wedding, attended by the ex- lover of one of the parties being married, who obviously is still in love with the person to whom it is addressed. While the lines \\"You came down the aisle/ Wearing a smile/ A vision of loveliness\\" might suggest the song being directed to a female, the best-known versions of the song have been sung by female singers, presumably to male ex-lovers. Patti Page Recording The biggest hit version was recorded by Patti Page. It was recorded on August 6, 1952, and issued by Mercury Records as catalog number 5899, with the flip side \\"You Belong to Me.\\" It first entered the Billboard chart on August 22, 1952, lasting 21 weeks and reaching #1 on the chart. \\"I Went to Your Wedding\\" also afforded Page a #1 hit in Australia. Cover Versions *Another version was recorded by the Sammy Kaye orchestra, on August 15, 1952, and issued by Columbia Records as catalog number 39856. *The song was also recorded by Alma Cogan in the United Kingdom in 1952. *A country music version by Hank Snow peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1952. *The French rendering of \\"I Went To Your Wedding,\\" re-titled \\"Ton mariage,\\" was recorded in 1953 by Lys Assia; Line Renaud and Tino Rossi also recorded versions. *Philippine singer Victor Wood performed and released a bilingual version of \\"I Went To Your Wedding\\" in which he alternated the original lyrics with Filipino ones. This particular cover became popular in the Philippines and gave some fame to the entertainer. Popular Culture *The song was parodied by Spike Jones and his City Slickers later in the decade, depicting the singer as glad to \\"get rid\\" of the bride. Ray Stevens covered the Spike Jones version in 2012 on the 9-CD project, The Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music.

At the age of 15, he began his professional broadcasting career calling games for a radio station that broadcast to local hospitals. In 1986, BBC Radio Scotland announcer David Francey suffered a knee injury and Rae, a 19-year-old student at the University of Aberdeen who had sent the BBC a copy of his radio work, substituted for him on the call of a Scottish Premier Division game between Kilmarnock F.C. and Dumbarton F.C..

The BBC then hired him as its Scotland football correspondent, a job he held for five years. Rae was the 1987 British Sports Broadcaster of the Year.  Career  Rae moved to the United States in anticipation of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. FIFA hired him as a press officer and he oversaw the World Cup games that were held at Foxboro Stadium.

It is about from downtown Ottawa. Prior to amalgamation in 2001, Carp was located in the West Carleton Township. Carp is located in the Carleton‚ÄîMississippi Mills electoral riding. According to the Canada 2011 Census, 1,965 people lived in the area around Carp (Craig Sideroad/Murphy Sideroad on the north, former Township limits on the east, March Road on the south and Thomas Argue Road on the west)Population calculated by combining dissemination areas 35061379 and 35061380 with census blocks 3506138101, 3506138102, 3506138103, 3506138105, 3506138110) History By 1866, Carp was a post village with a population of 200 of the Township of Huntley on the Carp river, from Ottawa. The village contained three stores, workshops, three hotels, and a town hall. The Loyal Orange Lodge, No. 439, met at the Orange Hall Carp on the first Wednesday in each month. Citizens included J. W. Featherston, general merchant and postmaster.Ottawa City and counties of Carleton and Russell Directory, 1866-7 The village takes its name from the Carp River which runs through the village. The main street was formerly a section of the Trans-Canada Highway and carried much of the traffic coming from the west into Ottawa. However the village has been bypassed with the development of the Highway 417. With the amalgamation of municipal governments in the region in 2001, Carp is now governed as part of the new city of Ottawa. Carp is used as a mailing address for most of the former Huntley Township.Google Maps As such, residents of this large area will identify themselves as living in Carp although they may live large distances from the village proper.

Several walking trails start in or near the town. The Carleton Masonic Lodge #465, a turn of the century (1900s) church building has been the Masonic Lodge in the Village of Carp since 1925. The building features original stained glass windows and is decorated with beautiful oak furniture that was originally located in a World War I Military Masonic Lodge in France.

The Carp River  The Carp River got its name due to the overwhelming amount of the carp fish that lived within it. In the early 19th century, the river was overrun with the fish because farmers used to throw all of their dead animals in it. Conversely, in \\"Carleton Saga\\" by Harry and Olive Walker, the over-abundant fish is said by early French explorers to be suckers and mud-pout, that in French translate as carpe.

He was the brother of Cole, John and Bob Younger Life Born in Missouri on January 15, 1848. Jim Younger was the ninth of fourteen children born to Henry Washington Younger and Bersheba Leighton Fristoe. With his brother Cole, he joined the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, eventually becoming a member of Quantrill's Raiders in 1864. Jim was later captured by Union troops, in the same ambush that resulted in William Quantrill's death, and was imprisoned until the war's end. After the war Jim tried his hand at various activities, including starting a horse ranch. In 1873 he joined the James‚ÄìYounger Gang, which was founded by Cole, along with Frank and Jesse James. It's uncertain how much time he spent with the gang, but he was present when his brother John was killed by Pinkertons in Roscoe, Missouri in 1874. He left the gang and spent the next two years working a ranch in San Luis Obispo, California. Return to James‚ÄìYounger Gang and death Jim returned to the gang in time to join the ill-fated 1876 bank job in Northfield, Minnesota. Part of his jaw was shot off and he was captured and sentenced to life imprisonment. Along with Cole, he was paroled in 1901. After his release he became engaged to Alix Mueller, who had met him in prison 20 years after the Northfield robbery. Due to the terms of his parole, however, Jim couldn't marry. He committed suicide on October 19, 1902. His body was returned to Lee's Summit, Missouri for burial. Film and television depiction In 1941, Younger was portrayed by actor Arthur Kennedy in the film Bad Men of Missouri. In 1950, Dewey Martin played Younger in the film Kansas Raiders, about his time spent with Quantrill's Raiders. In 1954, Sheb Wooley played Younger in an episode of Jim Davis's syndicated western television series, Stories of the Century. In the 1972 film The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid he was portrayed by Luke Askew. In the 1980 film The Long Riders he was portrayed by Keith Carradine.

Following a seven-month preparation throughout the year, Vreme was launched with its first issue coming out on 29 October 1990, little over a month before the 1990 general election in SR Serbia as the entire country of SFR Yugoslavia was transforming its governance from a one-party system under the Yugoslav Communist League (SKJ) to a multi-party one.

He was one of the original philatelic journalists.  Youth  Moens began collecting stamps from his family's mail as a boy in Tournai. He was the son of Colette Blangenois and Phillipe Moens, a soldier. He began with a small business in coins. By 1853, at age nineteen, he was buying and selling new and second-hand books, and stamps, from the Galerie Borthier, a covered walkway in central Brussels.. Within a decade he was putting out a stamp catalog with illustrated supplements.  First catalogue  In March 1862, with Louis Hanciau, Moens published a catalog of stamps, the Manuel des collectionneurs de timbres-poste (Handbook for Stamp Collectors). This work is the first of its kind in Belgium and the second in the French language, following that of the Parisian, Alfred Potiquet. Also in 1862, he published De la falsification des timbres-poste (On the falsification of postage stamps) to alert stamp enthusiasts to the abundance of forgeries. He began the first French language philatelic monthly, Le Timbre-Poste, which ran from 1863 until 1900, as well as a series on fiscal stamps from 1874 until 1896.Jean Baptiste Moens, French wikipedia  The Mauritius \\"Post Office\\" stamps  Moens became the owner of eight of the \\"Post Office\\" Mauritius stamps. In 1878 Moens published the first of his works on the early stamps of Mauritius, Les Timbres de Maurice depuis leur origine jusqu'√† nos jours, (The Stamps of Mauritius from their Origin until Today), benefiting from the studies of Edward B. Evans, the Philatelic Society of London, and Judge Frederick Philbrick. Helen Morgan noted, \\"All that is known of the discovery of the first specimens of the Post Office issue, indeed of much of the history of the handful of those stamps eventually found, came from his pen in the late 1890s. He handled most of the Post Office stamps discovered by Madame Borchard in the late 1860s.\\"  Organised philately  Moens was an Honorary Member of the Fiscal Philatelic Society until his death.The Bulletin, Fiscal Philatelic Society, Vol.I, No.1, October 1908.  Retirement  As Moens' business prospered, he assembled a large stock of collectibles of all kinds and a library devoted to music and antiquities, as well as stamps. By 1 November 1899, to preserve his health, Jean-Baptiste announced in Le Timbre-poste that the time had come to free himself from the duties of publication and to liquidate most of his stock in trade., (Retrieved 2008-04-02) After selling his rarities, the residue of Moens' stock, with a catalogue value of ¬£196,000 (1882 catalogue), was sold the following year to M Rubens, a stamp dealer of Copenhagen for an undisclosed figure.The Philatelic Record, June 1900, p. 156 His philatelic publications were eventually sold to H. Edgar Weston, in London, in 1907.  Death  Jean-Baptiste Moens died in Ixelles in 1908 and was interred there in the Ixelles Cemetery. His passing was noted by the philatelic press, many referring to him as The Father of Philately. References Further reading * Leclercq A. and G. Waroquiers.

Dalbec approached Matt Firestone to sing and they played under the moniker of Gateway for a few shows, before Firestone parted ways to focus on other projects. Dalbec then approached Aaron Bedard (who had previously sung for the Worcester, Massachusetts hardcore band Backbone) about singing for Bane. They went into the studio in December 1995 with a few friends and released a five-song demo. The next year saw the release of their first EP, and many shows throughout central Massachusetts. In early 1997, Bane released Free to Think, Free to Be EP, and in 1998 the band released the Holding This Moment 7\\" and CD collection, and embarked upon their first US tour. Like many other hardcore bands, Bane are known for their promotion of tolerance and unity within the scene. In 2014, Bane released their final album, Don't Wait Up, with the band stating that they still plan to tour. They played their last show on June 18, 2016 at the Worcester Palladium. History The band was founded in 1994 under the name Gateway. It was supposed to be intended only as a side project to Aaron Dalbec‚Äôs actual band Converge. In 1995 singer Aaron Bedard was asked to take over frontman duties. They quickly recorded a first demo, which contained five songs. Pete Chilton was added as bassist while Zach Jordan joined the band as second guitarist. Damon Bellorado, also a member of Converge, took over drumming duties. In May 1996, Bane released the EP ‚ÄòForked Tongue‚Äô and in 1997, ‚ÄòFree to Think, Free to Be joined., Both EPs appeared on Life Records. It was around this time that drummer Bellorado left the band in order to concentrate fully on Converge. Bellorado was briefly replaced by Ten Yard Fight drummer Ben Chused, before he was replaced in mid-1998 by the 19-year-old Nick Branigan (Close Call). A tour followed the release of Holding This Moment, which was actually a compilation of previously released EPs. In addition, the band held a US tour starting with Saves the Day. The album It All Comes Down to This was recorded in June 1999 in Austin Enterprises in Clinton, Massachusetts. The album was released on Equal Vision Records. In 2000, a tour followed by North America with Death by Stereo and Adamantium, as well as performances in Europe. In early September 2000, the band went into the studio again, where Converge Member Kurt Ballou worked as a producer to record two songs for a split release with Adamantium, which appeared on Indecision Records. Their second album Give Blood, which was released in 2001 was, in recorded and produced by Brian McTernan in Beltsville, Maryland. The release was followed with a tour of the USA along with Agnostic. In 2003, drummer Branigan left the band and was replaced by Bob Mahoney. Bane \\\\ followed with another tour of the USA, as well as a two-week tour of Japan in April 2004. In 2005 the band then went into the Salad Days Studios to record their next album titled The Note with producer McTernan, which appeared on Equal Vision Records. In March 2005, the band held a US tour with Comeback Kid and With Honour. In 2014, Bane released their final album, Don't Wait Up, with the band stating that they still plan to tour. They played their last show on June 18, 2016 at the Worcester Palladium. Straight edge In an early album Bane claimed straight edge, however it was never their main lyrical focus. The current original members are straight edge; Bob Mahoney and Stu are not. They still perform early songs with straight edge references, such as \\"Count Me Out\\" which includes the lyric \\"Just like this X on the back of my hand, I'm not going nowhere\\". However the lyrics to the song \\"Wasted On The Young\\", on Bane's album The Note can be interpreted as criticism of people who ignorantly claim straight edge too early in their life.

It tells the story of a group of young baseball players during the summer of 1962. It stars Tom Guiry, Mike Vitar, Karen Allen, Denis Leary, and James Earl Jones. The filming locations were in Midvale, Salt Lake City, and Ogden, Utah. It grossed $34 million worldwide and has become a cult film. Plot In the summer of 1962, brainy, reserved fifth grader Scotty Smalls moves with his parents to the San Fernando Valley, where he has difficulty making friends. He tries to join a group of boys who play baseball daily in a local sandlot, but is embarrassed by his inability to catch or throw the ball. An attempt to learn to play catch with his stepfather, Bill, results in a black eye. Nevertheless, he is invited to join the team by their leader and best player, Benny Rodriguez, who mentors him. When catcher Hamilton \\"Ham\\" Porter hits a home run into a backyard, Scotty attempts to retrieve the ball but is stopped by the other boys, who tell him of \\"the Beast\\", a junkyard dog supposedly so large and savage that it has become a neighborhood legend. Many baseballs hit into the yard over the years have all been claimed by the Beast, which is kept chained up by its owner, Mr. Mertle. One particularly hot day, the boys visit the community pool. Michael \\"Squints\\" Palledorous has a crush on lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn, and fakes drowning in order to get her to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The sandlot team is banned from the pool, but Squints' reputation is boosted. On the Fourth of July the team plays a night game by the light of the fireworks, and Scotty observes that although to the rest of them baseball is just a game, it is Benny's true passion. Later, they are challenged to play against a rival Little League team whom they handily defeat. To celebrate, they visit a fair where they try chewing tobacco and ride a spinning carnival ride; the combination causes them to vomit all over themselves and others. One day, Benny hits the team's only baseball so hard that he knocks the cover off. With Bill away on business, Scotty borrows a baseball from his trophy room that is autographed by legendary player Babe Ruth. Being ignorant of baseball history, Scotty does not realize the ball's value, and hits his first home run, sending it into the Beast's yard. When the other boys learn of the autograph, they tell Scotty its value and make several attempts to get the ball out of the yard using makeshift retrieval devices, but each is destroyed by the Beast. Benny has a dream in which the spirit of Babe Ruth advises him to retrieve the ball himself, and that this will be the moment that makes him a legend. Benny goes over the fence and \\"pickles\\" the Beast to retrieve the ball, but the English Mastiff breaks its chain and leaps over the fence in pursuit. It chases Benny through town, resulting in several comedic situations, and eventually back to the sandlot. Benny jumps back into Mr. Mertle's yard, but the Beast crashes through the fence, which falls down on top of it. Scotty and Benny lift the fence to free the dog, who shows gratitude by leading them to its stash of baseballs. They meet Mr. Mertle, who turns out to be a former baseball player who played with Babe Ruth but went blind after being struck by a baseball. He kindly trades them the chewed-up ball for one autographed by all of the 1927 New York Yankees. Scotty gives this ball to Bill, and their father-and-son relationship improves. The boys continue to play baseball on the sandlot, with the Beast‚Äîwhose real name is Hercules‚Äîas their mascot. Over the next few years, the sandlot kids go their separate ways. Benny's exploit with the Beast earns him the nickname \\"the Jet\\", and he goes on to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Scotty becomes a sports commentator, and covers a game against the San Francisco Giants in which Benny successfully steals home. Celebrating his victory, the two exchange thumbs up. Cast  Reception  = Critical = On Rotten Tomatoes, as of October 2020, the film had an approval rating of 63% from critics based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 6.06/10. The site's critical consensus read, \\"It may be shamelessly derivative and overly nostalgic, but The Sandlot is nevertheless a genuinely sweet and funny coming-of-age adventure.\\" On Metacritic, as of October 2020, the film had a score of 55 based on 27 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews. Accessed October 4, 2020. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, comparing the movie to a summertime version of A Christmas Story, based on the tone and narration of both films: \\"There was a moment in the film when Rodriguez hit a line drive directly at the pitcher's mound, and I ducked and held up my mitt, and then I realized I didn't have a mitt, and it was then I also realized how completely this movie had seduced me with its memories of what really matters when you are 12.\\" Bob Cannon of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, praising its simplicity and strong fundamentals. Leonard Klady of Variety gave the film a mostly negative review. He praised the cinematography and score, but felt the baseball team did not come together, and that the film, while sincere, was a \\"remarkably shallow wade, rife with incident and slim on substance.\\" = Box office = The film grossed $4,000,000 in its opening week-end and a further $32,000,000 through ticket sales. Figures for world-wide VHS and DVD sales are estimated to be at $76,000,000. Since its release on both VHS and DVD, the film has become a cult favorite. = Defamation suit = In 1998, Michael Polydoros sued 20th Century Fox and the producers of the film for defamation. Polydoros, a childhood classmate of David Mickey Evans, the writer and director of The Sandlot, claimed that the character Michael \\"Squints\\" Palledorous was derogatory and caused him shame and humiliation. The trial court found in favor of the film- makers, and that finding was affirmed by the California Court of Appeal. After initially agreeing to review the case in 1998, the Supreme Court of California reversed its decision, dismissing the review and reinstating the Court of Appeal's opinion in favor of 20th Century Fox. =Home media= In 1993, The Sandlot first came to home video in a slipcase, along with the LaserDisc in widescreen, but later came in a clam shell case in 1994. On January 29, 2002, the DVD came in a Family Feature, in widescreen (Side B) and full screen (Side A). The 2013 repackaged DVD is only in widescreen. On March 26, 2013, the film released on Blu-ray for the first time to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The film then had a rerelease on Blu-ray and Digital HD on March 27, 2018 as part of the film's 25th anniversary.

The tax was a major source of revenue for the Spanish monarchy. In 1723 the tax was reduced to 10%. Rather than levy the tax on the basis of the amount of silver or gold produced, the government tracked the amount of mercury used. Mercury was essential for the refinement of silver and gold in the patio process (see also amalgamation). The Spanish government had a monopoly of mercury production, through its mines at Almad√©n in Spain and at Huancavelica in Peru. In 1648 the Viceroy of Peru declared that Potos√≠ and Huancavelica were \\"the two pillars that support this kingdom and that of Spain.\\" Moreover, the viceroy thought that Spain could, if necessary, dispense with the silver from Potos√≠, but it could not dispense with the mercury from Huancavelica.Arthur Preston Whitaker, The Huancavelica Mercury Mine: A Contribution to the History of the Bourbon Renaissance in the Spanish Empire, Harvard Historical Monographs 16 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1941).

Founded by Mary E. Behner in the tradition of the settlement house movement, \\"The Shack\\" continues to serve their social, educational, recreational, economic, and health needs. History Sponsored by mission the First Presbyterian Church in Morgantown and the church's National Board of Missions, \\"The Shack\\" sought to meet the spiritual as well as the social and physical needs of coal miners and their families. During the Great Depression, Eleanor Roosevelt visited \\"The Shack\\" and the especially hard hit Scotts Run area. Nearly two-thirds of the area's residents were suffering in terrible poverty. There were 10,000 people and 22 different nationalities clustered on hills and near polluted creeks along the nine miles of eight communities. Mary Behner, a 1928 College of Wooster graduate, was first given an abandoned schoolhouse in Stumptown and started a Sunday School and recreation there in November 1928. But soon children were coming to her without food and clothes. She expanded into social service. Hundreds attended her programs. She brought nearby West Virginia University students to teach. She started a library, charm school, choruses, sewing club, and the first integrated nursery school. In 1932, she received from the coal company an abandoned company store which she named The Shack. The Quakers and other agencies handled relief programs from The Shack. She started the Uhyscool Club to encourage the first students to finish high school and college. The area was photographed by Lewis Hine, Ben Shahn and Walker Evans. The Shack was written up in the Christian Science Monitor and other publications. Behner left in 1937 to be married. Her diaries and photos were donated to the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. A new Shack building was finished in 1938 west of the original site and a third building down the same Route 7 which exists today. On May 6, 2008, an historical marker was placed near the original site, along a now widened Route 7 in Pursglove. Her daughter, Bettijane Christopher Burger, of Charleston, WV, petitioned the state for the marker. Most of the mines are closed and the hills returned to grassy slopes. In 2006, The Shack received an outreach grant from the Mollohan Foundation for the Appalachian Rags to Rugs Program. As of 2012, The Shack continues to provide \\"a safe, secure place for families and children to come and play. We attempt to provide services for children throughout their entire school careers, during the entire year,\\" including preschool, after school programs, and swimming lessons. Even though the religious mission of \\"The Shack\\" ended when the church planted there by the Presbyterian Church (USA) had closed, it continued to operate with support from the PC(USA), other denominations, the United Way, and generous donors.

As of August 2009, the district was rated as \\"Recognized\\" by the Texas Education Agency. The district serves in parts of Harris County, Fort Bend County and Waller County. Most of the district lies within the boundaries of the City of Houston, the City of Katy or their municipalities' extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). Unincorporated areas in Katy ISD include Barker, Cinco Ranch, and Cimarron.Johnson, Trish. \\"Location helps make Cimarron popular.\\" Houston Chronicle. April 7, 2009. Retrieved on March 25, 2010. All residential areas of the district are assigned to an elementary school, a junior high school, and a high school by subdivision. History During the 2004‚Äì2005 school year Katy ISD began a new and revolutionary program in the history of the district, with the use of random drug testing for all individuals involved in UIL competitive organizations, student leaders of any official school clubs, and anyone wishing to park on campus. This caused much controversy prior to its instatement. Many parents complained to the school district, citing the new policy as the violation of individual rights. The district responded to this by having every student who wished to participate in the said activities sign a waiver granting the school district to test them randomly. This matter had already been settled by the Supreme Court of the United States as constitutional before KISD chose to implement it. In 2015 two sections of Thornwood, two and three, currently served by KISD, proposed being removed from KISD and placed in the Spring Branch Independent School District, but both KISD and SBISD's boards denied the proposal. Superintendents Superintendent Lance Hindt was an alumnus of Katy Taylor High School, and in 2012 wrote a Phd thesis for the University of Houston (UH). In 2018 individuals accused Hindt of severe bullying while he was enrolled in KISD's secondary schools. A former classmate of Hindt, later a judge in Alabama, accused him of severe bullying while he was enrolled in high school. National Association of Scholars president Peter Wood accused superintendent Lance Hindt of plagiarizing his dissertation. The University of Houston administration stated that it would investigate the matter. After an 18-month investigation, the University of Houston removed Hindt's dissertation from their official website. That year Hindt resigned, and the district agreed to pay $955,795 as severance; a payment which violated Texas Education Code Section 11.201 and resulted in a loss of $513,755 in funding. To pursue any defamation claims on behalf of Hindt the district hired the law firm Feldman and Feldman. Hindt would later campaign for the KISD board members who had defended him and arranged his huge severance bonus.

She carried out a comprehensive training schedule along the east coast and in the Caribbean until 18 June 1924 when she sailed from Newport, Rhode Island for a tour of duty with U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, calling at ports in 15 countries before returning to New York 16 July 1925. Returning to east coast and Caribbean operations, Flusser aided in the development of destroyer tactics and carried reservists on training cruises until decommissioned at Philadelphia 1 May 1930. She was scrapped 22 October 1930 in accordance with the terms of the London Treaty limiting naval armaments.

Biography =Early career= A native of Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Isogai graduated from the 16th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1904. Future generals Seishir≈ç Itagaki and Kenji Doihara were among his classmates. He graduated from the 27th class of the Army War College (Japan) and was known for his fascination with all things Chinese. In 1928, Isogai was attached to the IJA 3rd Division. He was given command of the IJA 7th Infantry Regiment from 1928‚Äì1930, and became Chief of Staff of the IJA 1st Division in 1930.Ammentorp, The Generals of World War II From 1931-1937, he held a number of staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff; however, with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Isogai volunteered to be a military attach√© to China. The position was very short, as he was soon assigned to a combat command as the commander in chief of the IJA 10th Division in China, participating in the Tianjin‚ÄìPukou Railway Operation and the Battle of Taierzhuang. In 1938, Isogai was transferred to Manchukuo as Chief of Staff of the Kwangtung Army shortly before the disastrous Nomonhan Incident. He was recalled to Japan, and forced into retirement in 1939.Coox, Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939 =Hong Kong= General Isogai as Governor of Hong Kong With the start of the Pacific War, Isogai was recalled to active duty in 1942. He was appointed Governor-General of Japanese-occupied Hong Kong on February 20, 1942 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç, his former superior officer while serving with the Kwangtung Army. During Isogai's tenure, Hong Kong was subjected to martial law. He based his command post at the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon. Although Isogai arrived after the worst excesses committed by Japanese troops against civilians during the conquest of Hong Kong, and Isogai's troops (for the most part) were more disciplined than most Japanese forces in mainland China, Hongkongers suffered much deprivation from food shortages. The creation and subsequent inflation of the Japanese Military Yen, a currency without reserves issued by the Japanese Imperial Army administration, caused severe disruption of the economy, impoverishing many Hong Kong residents. Public transportation and utilities unavoidably failed, due to shortage of fuel and American air raids killed thousands, leaving more homeless.Snow, The Fall of Hong Kong While Isogai was much hated by many older generations of Hong Kong people, Isogai is credited with introducing an important element of Hong Kong life during his tenure: Sunday horseracing. Sunday horseracing is now a very important part of Hong Kong culture, in which thousands participate. Also, Isogai was responsible for the addition of Japanese elements of architecture on the facade of the Hong Kong Government House. Isogai retired from the post on December 24, 1944, and returned to Japan. At the end of the war, he was arrested by the SCAP authorities and extradited to Nanjing, China, where he faced a military tribunal for war crimes committed during the occupation of Hong Kong. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but released in 1952, and allowed to return to Japan. He died in 1967.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II See also * Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong =Books= * * References External links * Category:Japanese generals Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II Category:1886 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Japanese occupation of Hong Kong Category:Japanese people convicted of war crimes Category:Japanese prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Military personnel from Hy≈çgo Prefecture Category:20th-century Hong Kong people Category:20th-century Japanese politicians Category:Heads of state convicted of war crimes ","title":"Rensuke Isogai"},{"id":"2068941","text":"Hubert Schleichert (born July 30, 1935 in Vienna - September 13, 2020 in Munich) was an Austrian emeritus philosopher (from Vienna), now living in Konstanz.

Viloria, the main founder, retired to focus on his college studies; he was the group's main composer for several years. His home was also the main place where practices were held in the group's early years. The name Guaco is attributed a bird named \\"Guaco\\" that would fly over Viloria's house every morning. The band began as a gaita zuliana group, and during the 70s diverged from the traditional way of playing the genre by integrating it with elements of salsa music (such as complex horn arrangements), and adding in violins and electric guitars which were very unusual instruments to be included in a gaita band. Today, the Guaco rhythm continues to evolve through a complex mixture of gaita, salsa, pop music, jazz, funk and even rock and roll and vallenato rhythms, concocting a recognizable and unique style that is considered to be a hallmark of the tropical music genre. Guaco won Pepsi Venezuela Music Awards for Tropical Video of the Year in 2012, for Artist of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Tropical Video of the Year, and Tropical Artist of the Year in 2013, for Best Tropical Artist in 2014, and for Salsa Song of the Year, Salsa Video of the Year, Tropical Fusion Album of the Year, and Album of the Year in 2015.

It is composed of 16 wards and five communes with a total of . Quy Nh∆°n is the capital of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. As of 2009 its population was 280,535. Historically, the commercial activities of the city focused on agriculture and fishing. In recent years, however, there has been a significant shift towards service industries and tourism. There is also a substantial manufacturing sector. History The town of Quy Nh∆°n was officially founded in the late 18th century, although its origins stretch back much further to the 11th-century Champa culture, the T√¢y S∆°n dynasty and the 18th century seaport of Th·ªã N·∫°i. During the 1620s the town was host to Portuguese Jesuits who called the place Pulo Cambi. During the Ming treasure voyages of the 15th century, the Chinese fleet led by Admiral Zheng He would always make port at Quy Nh∆°n in Champa as their first destination after leaving China. The city is renowned as the birthplace of 18th century Vietnamese emperor Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªáDiscover Vietnam and, more recently, had a large American military presence during the Vietnam War. Today the city is recognized as a first class city with a geo-economic priority and an urbanized infrastructure. The government describes it as one of the three commercial and tourism centres of the central southern coastal region (with ƒê√† N·∫µng and Nha Trang). Geography The beachfront at Quy Nhon Quy Nh∆°n has a varied topography, being extremely diversified with mountains and forests, hills, fields, salt marshes, plains, lagoons, lakes, rivers, shorelines, peninsulas and islands. Its coastline is 42 km long with sandy beaches, abundant seafood resources and other natural products of economic value. The city has sixteen wards: Tr·∫ßn H∆∞ng ƒê·∫°o, L√™ L·ª£i, L√™ H·ªìng Phong, Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫, L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ª´, ƒê·ªëng ƒêa, Th·ªã N·∫°i, H·∫£i C·∫£ng, Ng√¥ M√¢y, Gh·ªÅnh R√°ng, Quang Trung, Nh∆°n B√¨nh, Nh∆°n Ph√∫, B√πi Th·ªã Xu√¢n and Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu.

Quy Nh∆°n railway station could be reached by a branch off the main line of the North‚ÄìSouth railway, but this line was suspended in May 2016. Reunification express trains stop only in Di√™u Tr√¨ railway station, which is around 10 km west of Quy Nh∆°n.  Economy  Quy Nh∆°n is one of the main industrial centres of the South Central Coast, behind only ƒê√† N·∫µng and Nha Trang.Atlat Dia li Viet Nam (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010 It is also the major industrial and service centre of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, including its largest industrial facilities at Phu Tai Industrial Park and Nh∆°n H·ªôi Economic Zone. The city's economic activities include industries, export-imports, seaport services, aquatic product husbandry and tourism. The economic trend, at present, is increasingly service-based at the expense of agriculture, forestry and pisciculture. Cereals are cultivated on 2548 ha of Quy Nh∆°n's land with an output of 13,021 tons as of 2009, just 2% of the province's total.B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Statistics Office (2010): B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Statistical Yearbook 2009. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi Other crops included 10,891 tons of vegetables, 2,795 tons of sugar-cane, as well as smaller amounts of coconuts, peanuts and cashew nuts. Much of the city's industry is concentrated in and around Phu Tai Industrial Park in the west of the city along National Route 1A. Quy Nh∆°n is a major centre of garden furniture manufacturing. It has traditionally been relying on access to wood from B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh's forests as well as the Central Highlands provinces of Gia Lai and Kon Tum and even as far as Cambodia's Ratanakiri and Laos' Attapeu Province. Most of the furniture factories are located in Phu Tai Industrial Park. Several chemical enterprises that supply the furniture and wood processing industry have been set up in the vicinity of the industrial park.People's Committee B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh (2007): Yearbook of Information on Enterprises in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. Labour Publishing House, Hanoi: 162‚Äì165 Other industries in Quy Nh∆°n process agricultural and aquatic products, or produce construction materials and paper products. Bidiphar is a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Quy Nh∆°n that is an exception to the city's general focus on basic and wood processing industries. Nh∆°n H·ªôi Economic Zone is central to the city's and province's industrial development plans. However, as of late 2010 it was still in the early stages of development, with few factories completed. Quy Nh∆°n has seen only limited foreign investment. As of 2008, 13 foreign companies employed 1119 people in the city. Currently the economic structure of Quy Nh∆°n is a shift towards increasing the proportion of service industries, reducing the rate of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in GDP. The shares of agriculture, forestry and fisheries ‚Äì industrial and construction ‚Äì services in GDP in 2006 reached 36.7%, 28% and 35.3%, respectively, while in 2005 it was at 38.4%, 26.7% and 34.9%, respectively. The income per capita in 2018 was US$6,025 per person. Climate Quy Nh∆°n has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: As).  Education  Quy Nh∆°n has two universities: Quy Nh∆°n University and Quang Trung University. As of 2009 they had a total teaching staff of 601 and 23,383 students, 13,704 of whom were female. There were 19,900 primary school students and 28,500 secondary school students.  Cuisine  Quy Nh∆°n is home to multiple Vietnamese domestically famous dishes: * B√°nh x√®o t√¥m nh·∫£y (jumping-shrimps fried pancake): These pancakes are made with special formulas and each restaurant has its own way of making distinguished dipping fish sauce for this dish. * B√°nh h·ªèi ch√°o l√≤ng: The dish composes of two sub-dishes: \\"B√°nh h·ªèi\\" (a type of rice cake in Vietnam) and \\"ch√°o l√≤ng\\" (pig's internal organs porridge). * B√∫n ch·∫£ c√° (fish-cake rice vermicelli). * Ch·∫£ ram t√¥m ƒë·∫•t (shrimp spring roll).

She was named for Weedon Osborne. Naval Service Osborne was laid down 23 September 1919 at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; launched 29 December 1919; co-sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Osborne Fisher, sister of Ltjg W. E. Osborne and Mrs. C. H. Cox; and commissioned 17 May 1920, Lieutenant Dennis L. Ryan in command. Commissioned into a peacetime navy curtailed by a retrenching Congress, the undermanned four-stacker departed Boston, Massachusetts 25 June to join DESRON 3, Atlantic Fleet. The limited coastal operations of 1920 were supplemented by 2 months of fleet exercises and battle problems off Cuba during the first quarter of 1921. Whether operating out of Charleston, South Carolina, her normal base of operations, or out of the Brooklyn or Philadelphia Navy Yards Osborne regularly steamed southward early each year for these competitive exercises and large scale tactical maneuvers. These useful testing periods brought a familiarization not only with the Caribbean area but also the Pacific coast of Panama. Under the new command of Raymond A. Spruance, Osborne steamed from Boston 18 June 1925, to \\"show the flag\\" on an extensive year-long cruise in the western half of the Mediterranean Sea and along the western European coastline. On 20 September 1929 entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for inactivation. Osborne decommissioned 1 May 1930 with her crew transferring to the newly recommissioned . In accordance with the agreements reached at the London Naval Disarmament Conference of 1930, she was struck from the Navy List 22 October 1930 and sold for scrap 17 January 1931. Commercial service The ship was sold to Standard Fruit Company of New Orleans where she was gutted to her hull and fitted with two new deck houses, electrical plant and other ship service plants and with dual Ingersoll-Rand Diesel engines by Todd Dry Dock and Construction Company. With the new name Matagalpa and four holds capable of carrying a total of 25,000 banana stems between Central America and New Orleans the Standard Fruit & Steamship Company operated banana boat operated until the eve of World War II. The ship was surveyed and taken by the Navy under a bare boat charter until the urgent need to resupply the Philippines as Japanese forces took Manila resulted in their being taken over by the United States Army. U.S. Army service On 22 February 1942 General MacArthur had requested direct support from Honolulu rather than Australia as it was lacking in resources. Within a day a very high level study of the situation concluded three old ex destroyers converted into fast commercial fruit carriers, now named Masaya, Matagalpa and Teapa,It is unclear from cited references currently in wikipedia whether Teapa was ex- or ex-. Four ships were converted to banana boat service of which three became fast Army transports. Weight of other references, in specialist forums and in Attempts to Supply The Philippines by Sea: 1942 by Charles Dana Gibson and E. Kay Gibson clearly have Putnam becoming Teapa. and recently taken over under bare boat charter by the War Department with intentions to use them as inter-island transports would be suited to that supply requirement. Under urgent Presidential orders to support the forces in Bataan and Corregidor the Army began to prepare the ships to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines. Cargoes were shipped to New Orleans for the three ships. They were originally due to sail on 28 February 1942 but difficulties, including securing naval gun crews to put on the ships, delayed sailing. Masaya sailed on 2 March 1942, Matagalpa on 11 March and Teapa on 18 March. While the situation in the Philippines became desperate the three ships were forced to stop in Los Angeles for repair. On 13 April General MacArthur reported blockade running was \\"useless,\\" but the War Department decided to make the attempt. The ships were reloaded with Matagalpa loaded for Mindanao and arriving in Honolulu on 8 May 1942, too late to relieve Corregidor. Matagalpa and the other ships intended for supply of the Philippines, were diverted to Australia. Fate On 26 June 1942 Matagalpa burned at her berth in Sydney, Australia, as over one hundred firefighters worked to unload gasoline drums and fight the fire. Matagalpa was not repaired and was scuttled in the \\"disposal area\\" off Sydney on 6 September 1947.

The plot concerns a school shooting. It was inspired by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. Plot Andre Kriegman and Calvin Gabriel (loosely based on Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold) announce their intention to attack their school, Iroquois High School, calling their plan \\"Zero Day\\". They keep a video diary on the camera, carefully hiding their plans from their friends and families. The majority of the film is portrayed through their video filming, and shows them planning, preparing, and mentioning some of their motives. Other scenes show the two attending Andre's birthday party, egging the house of someone they dislike, and Cal going to the prom while Andre works at a pizza place. In one video entry, Cal notes the origin of the name \\"Zero Day\\": Cal and Andre originally planned to attack on the first day on which the temperature dropped to zero degrees after they had finished their preparations. This plan soon proved impractical, and they set May 1, 2001 as the new date. Wanting their attack to have a memorable name, they agreed to keep the original title. The boys arrive at school on May 1 and prepare their plan and weapons in Andre's car. Andre says that he could never have carried out Zero Day without Cal's help, a sentiment Cal echoes. They run into the school, armed with two .45-caliber semi-automatic pistols (Glock 21C & Norinco M1911), a .357 Magnum Ruger GP100 revolver, an M1 carbine, and a Smith and Wesson Model 3000 12-gauge pump-action shotgun w/ a ‚Äúshort skirt‚Äù/illegally-modified stock (nicknamed \\"Milena\\"), all stolen from Andre's father and cousin. The massacre is shown through the viewpoint of security cameras (similar to the infamous surveillance tapes from the 1999 Columbine High School massacre). The dialogue is heard via the cellphone of a student who was shot and killed. Shooting at anyone they see and threatening and taunting several witnesses, Andre and Cal kill eleven students, one school resource officer, and wound eighteen others. The pair eventually see law enforcement entering the school in force after sixteen minutes of shooting. After arguing over whether to engage the police in gunfire, the pair decide to count to three and shoot themselves. On May 10, a group of youths film themselves going to a park where memorial crosses are standing. They say that Andre and Cal killed twelve people before also killing themselves. The kids find crosses for the two shooters and light them on fire. Cast In order of appearance: * Andre Keuck as Andre Kriegman * Cal Robertson as Calvin Gabriel * Christopher Coccio as Chris Kriegman * Gerhard Keuck as Andre's Father * Johanne Keuck as Andre's Mother * Rachel Benichak as Rachel Lurie * Pam Robertson as Cal's Mother * Steve Robertson as Cal's Father * Omar Walters as shooting victim Omar Production Ben Coccio recalls that he was in a Brooklyn pizzeria on the day of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, and saw coverage of the event on the eatery's television, commenting, \\"I remember thinking that I was surprised that it hadn't happened sooner.\\" Coccio was also struck by the extent to which Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold planned that shooting, compared to the impromptu crimes of passion that typified other school shootings. Coccio became eager to address the story in a way that was not exploitative, and drew upon his own views of high school as a place of tension where \\"anything could happen at any time\\". Coccio's theory of student school shooters is not that they are the most bullied, as such students tend to develop feelings of inferiority and are likely to harm themselves. Coccio feels that shooters tend to be students with feelings of superiority, and that \\"when other people don‚Äôt confirm that, it really gets under their skin.\\" None of the numerous Connecticut high schools where he sought to film the movie would allow Coccio access, and he ended up using the interior of a building at State University of New York at Purchase in Purchase, New York. The \\"appropriately fortress-like\\" exterior of the High School was New Milford High School in New Milford, Connecticut, where Coccio lived at the time. When casting, Coccio inquired at high schools throughout Connecticut looking for teenagers interested in acting who might not have much or any professional experience. Coccio had three days of open auditions. Andre Keuck responded to an ad Coccio placed in Backstage Magazine and brought his classmate and fellow theater enthusiast Cal Robertson along to the audition. Both boys had acted in Shakespeare productions at the Stratford Avon theater in Stratford, Connecticut. They were encouraged to improvise throughout the film's production. Reception Zero Day has received mostly positive reviews from critics, currently holding a 68% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 critic reviews. Despite the positive reception from critics and audiences, Zero Day was a box office bomb, gaining only $8,466 against a $20,000 budget.

Early life Howard's parents were timber-merchant Major. David Liddon Howard MC (1896‚Äì1958), son of timber-merchant Alexander Liddon Howard (1863-1946), and Katharine Margaret ('Kit') Somervell (1895‚Äì1975), a dancer with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and daughter of the composer Sir Arthur Somervell. (One of her brothers, Colin, lived with her and her third husband, Kingsley Amis, for 17 years.) Mostly educated at home, she briefly attended Francis Holland School before attending domestic-science college at Ebury Street and secretarial college in central London. Career Howard worked briefly as an actress in provincial repertory and occasionally as a model before her writing career, which began in 1947. The Beautiful Visit (1950), Howard's first novel, was described as \\"distinctive, self-assured and remarkably sensual\\", won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1951 for best novel by a writer under 30. She next collaborated with Robert Aickman, writing three of the six short stories in the collection We Are for the Dark (1951). Her second novel, The Long View (1956), describes a marriage in reverse chronology; Angela Lambert remarked, \\"Why The Long View isn't recognised as one of the great novels of the 20th century I will never know.\\" Five further novels followed before she embarked on her best known work, the Cazalet Chronicles, at the suggestion of her stepson Martin Amis. The Chronicles were a family saga \\"about the ways in which English life changed during the war years, particularly for women.\\" They follow three generations of a middle- class English family and draw heavily on Howard's own life and memories. The first four volumes, The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, and Casting Off, were published from 1990 to 1995. The fifth, All Change, was written in just a year and published in 2013; it was her final novel. Millions of copies of the Cazalet Chronicles were sold worldwide. The Light Years and Marking Time were serialised by Cinema Verity for BBC Television as The Cazalets in 2001. A BBC Radio 4 version in 45 episodes was also broadcast from 2012. Howard wrote the screenplay for the 1989 movie Getting It Right, directed by Randal Kleiser, based on her 1982 novel of the same name, as well as TV scripts for Upstairs, Downstairs. She also wrote a book of short stories, Mr. Wrong (1975), and edited two anthologies, including The Lover's Companion (1978). Autobiography and biographies Howard's autobiography, Slipstream, was published in 2002. A biography, entitled Elizabeth Jane Howard: A Dangerous Innocence by Artemis Cooper, was published by John Murray in 2017. A reviewer said it was \\"strongest in the case it makes for the virtues of Howard's fiction\\". Personal life Howard married Peter Scott in 1942, at age 19, and they had a daughter, Nicola (born 1943). Howard left Scott in 1946 to become a writer, and they were divorced in 1951. At this time she was employed as part- time secretary to the pioneering canals conservation organisation the Inland Waterways Association, where she met and collaborated with Robert Aickman. She had an affair with Aickman, described in her autobiography Slipstream (2002). Her second marriage, to Australian broadcaster Jim Douglas-Henry in 1958, was brief. Her third marriage, to novelist Kingsley Amis, whom she met while organising the Cheltenham Literary Festival, lasted from 1965 to 1983; for part of that time, 1968‚Äì1976, they lived at Lemmons, a Georgian house in Barnet, where Howard wrote Something in Disguise (1969).Leader, Zachary. The Life of Kingsley Amis, Jonathan Cape, 2006, p. 633. Her stepson, Martin Amis, has credited her with encouraging him to become a more serious reader and writer. In later life, she lived in Bungay, Suffolk, and was appointed CBE in 2000. She died at home on 2 January 2014, aged 90.

The picture of this intuitive notion is this: 500px where \\\\hat{p} denotes the nominal point, P denotes the space of all possible values of the object p, and the shaded area, P(s), represents the set of points that satisfy the stability conditions. The radius of the blue circle, shown in red, is the stability radius.  Abstract definition  The formal definition of this concept varies, depending on the application area. The following abstract definition is quite usefulZlobec S. (2009). Nondifferentiable optimization: Parametric programming.

History  It looks like the concept was invented in the early 1960s.Wilf, H.S. (1960). Maximally stable numerical integration. Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 8(3),537-540.Milne, W.E., and Reynolds, R.R. (1962). Fifth-order methods for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations.

Stability radii of linear systems, Systems and Control Letters, 7, 1-10. and optimization.Zlobec S. (1988). Characterizing Optimality in Mathematical Programming Models. Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 12, 113-180. It is widely used as a model of local robustness against small perturbations in a given nominal value of the object of interest.  Relation to Wald's maximin model  It was shown that the stability radius model is an instance of Wald's maximin model. That is, :\\\\max \\\\ \\\\\\\\{\\\\rho\\\\ge 0: p\\\\in P(s), \\\\forall p\\\\in B(\\\\rho,\\\\hat{p})\\\\\\\\} \\\\equiv \\\\max_{\\\\rho\\\\ge 0}\\\\min_{p\\\\in B(\\\\rho,\\\\hat{p})} f(\\\\rho,p) where :f(\\\\rho,p) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\\\rho &, \\\\ p\\\\in P(s)  -\\\\infty &,\\\\ p otin P(s)\\\\end{array}\\\\right. The large penalty (-\\\\infty) is a device to force the \\\\max player not to perturb the nominal value beyond the stability radius of the system. It is an indication that the stability model is a model of local stability/robustness, rather than a global one.  Info-gap decision theory  Info-gap decision theory is a recent non- probabilistic decision theory. It is claimed to be radically different from all current theories of decision under uncertainty. But it has been shown that its robustness model, namely :\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}(q,\\\\tilde{u}):= \\\\max\\\\ \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha\\\\ge 0: r_{c} \\\\le R(q,u),\\\\forall u\\\\in U(\\\\alpha,\\\\tilde{u})\\\\\\\\} is actually a stability radius model characterized by a simple stability requirement of the form r_{c}\\\\le R(q,u) where q denotes the decision under consideration, u denotes the parameter of interest, \\\\tilde{u} denotes the estimate of the true value of u and U(\\\\alpha,\\\\tilde{u}) denotes a ball of radius \\\\alpha centered at \\\\tilde{u}. 500px Since stability radius models are designed to deal with small perturbations in the nominal value of a parameter, info-gap's robustness model measures the local robustness of decisions in the neighborhood of the estimate \\\\tilde{u}. Sniedovich argues that for this reason the theory is unsuitable for the treatment of severe uncertainty characterized by a poor estimate and a vast uncertainty space.  Alternate definition  There are cases where it is more convenient to define the stability radius slightly different. For example, in many applications in control theory the radius of stability is defined as the size of the smallest destabilizing perturbation in the nominal value of the parameter of interest.Paice A.D.B. and Wirth, F.R. (1998). Analysis of the Local Robustness of Stability for Flows. Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems, 11, 289-302. The picture is this: 500px More formally, : \\\\hat{\\\\rho}(q):= \\\\min_{p otin P(s)} dist(p,\\\\hat{p}) where dist(p,\\\\hat{p}) denotes the distance of p\\\\in P from \\\\hat{p}.  Stability radius of functions  The stability radius of a continuous function f (in a functional space F) with respect to an open stability domain D is the distance between f and the set of unstable functions (with respect to D). We say that a function is stable with respect to D if its spectrum is in D. Here, the notion of spectrum is defined on a case by case basis, as explained below. = Definition = Formally, if we denote the set of stable functions by S(D) and the stability radius by r(f,D), then: :r(f,D)=\\\\inf_{g\\\\in C}\\\\\\\\{\\\\g\\\\:f+g otin S(D)\\\\\\\\}, where C is a subset of F. Note that if f is already unstable (with respect to D), then r(f,D)=0 (as long as C contains zero). = Applications = The notion of stability radius is generally applied to special functions as polynomials (the spectrum is then the roots) and matrices (the spectrum is the eigenvalues). The case where C is a proper subset of F permits us to consider structured perturbations (e.g. for a matrix, we could only need perturbations on the last row). It is an interesting measure of robustness, for example in control theory. = Properties= Let f be a (complex) polynomial of degree n, C=F be the set of polynomials of degree less than (or equal to) n (which we identify here with the set \\\\mathbb{C}^{n+1} of coefficients). We take for D the open unit disk, which means we are looking for the distance between a polynomial and the set of Schur stable polynomials. Then: :r(f,D)=\\\\inf_{z\\\\in \\\\partial D}\\\\frac{f(z)}{\\\\q(z)\\\\}, where q contains each basis vector (e.g. q(z)=(1,z,\\\\ldots,z^n) when q is the usual power basis). This result means that the stability radius is bound with the minimal value that f reaches on the unit circle. = Examples = * The polynomial f(z)=z^8-9/10 (whose zeros are the 8th-roots of 0.9) has a stability radius of 1/80 if q is the power basis and the norm is the infinity norm. So there must exist a polynomial g with (infinity) norm 1/90 such that f+g has (at least) a root on the unit circle. Such a g is for example g(z)=-1/90\\\\sum_{i=0}^8 z^i. Indeed, (f+g)(1)=0 and 1 is on the unit circle, which means that f+g is unstable.

Baxley in his feature film directorial debut, and starring Carl Weathers, Vanity, Craig T. Nelson, and Sharon Stone. The film was released in the United States on 12 February 1988. Paula Abdul was the film choreographer. The film was released by Lorimar Film Entertainment. Vanity was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actress. The film received negative reviews. Plot The story prologues with two auto-worker union officials addressing the recent death of a peer. Within moments, both are brutally murdered by a group of shadowy, almost supernatural killers that seem to move, disappear and reappear at will during a daring skyscraper assault. Detroit Police Department Detective Sergeant Jericho Jackson, known locally as \\"Action Jackson\\", was a celebrated lieutenant in the police force but demoted (nearly two years before) because of a case he headed involving the criminal son of successful businessman Peter Anthony Dellaplane. The fallout over the case also collapsed Jackson's marriage and put the law-school-educated, star athlete and hometown hero at odds with the public. Even after his demotion, Jackson's continued interest leads to conflicts with his commander, Captain Armbruster, but he begins investigating Dellaplane's professional exploits, eventually uncovering a string of murdered trade-union members connected to Dellaplane's company. He discovers Dellaplane is secretly maneuvering into a \\"behind-the-throne\\" seat of power, and has been using a group of assassins, \\"The Invisible Men\\", to murder uncooperative union officials. Jackson is assisted by Dellaplane's mistress, Sydney Ash, a local lounge singer and heroin addict, whom the businessman has assisted financially. He is eventually framed in the murder of Dellaplane's wife Patrice (who was actually killed by her husband, after her discovery of his plot, and her seeking help from Jackson). On the run from the police, Jackson is helped by friends from his old neighborhood: Kid Sable, a local hotel owner and retired professional boxer and Dee, a lively local hairdresser (and gossip informant) who gives Jackson a way to discreetly get to Dellaplane Jackson and Sydney arrange a meeting with Dellaplane's figurehead replacement for the auto union, unaware that The Invisible Men had been tracking them and allowed the meeting so that Dellaplane could confront Jackson face to face. Before he leaves with Sydney in tow, Dellaplane arrogantly reveals the reasoning for his plans and intends to exact it using Jackson as a pawn. He intends to kill Jackson, put one of The Invisible Men in his place, have him kill an important union official, and then have Jackson's charred body discovered after he failed his getaway. \\"Dellaplane, one of these days you are really going to piss me off,\\" Jackson calls after his nemesis as he leaves with all but three of The Invisible Men. \\"We're going to have ourselves a little barbecue,\\" Shaker, The Invisible Men's leader claims as they prepare to burn Jackson alive. But Jackson is suddenly rescued by Sydney's bodyguard \\"Big\\" Edd and the pair battle the Invisible Men. Edd overpowers Birch, knocking him into a control panel, electrocuting him, while Jackson turns the wielding torch they were about to use on him on Thaw, who is killed when the gasoline can he is holding explodes. Shaker opens fire on the pair with his grenade launcher, sending them running for cover.They lure him outside where Edd disarms him and Jackson takes the grenade launcher.(\\"Barbecue, huh? How do you like your ribs?\\" Jackson asks Shaker before he opens fire, killing him.) Jackson's escape leads to a fight at Dellaplane's mansion during the birthday party for the union leader Dellaplane plans to have assassinated. During the melee, the other members of The Invisible Men are killed by Jackson (who personally deals with the one set to make the kill and frame him), Edd, Jackson's old partner Detective Kotterwell, and a rehabilitated young thief named Albert, with help from Kid Sable. However, Dellaplane takes Sydney hostage and hides inside a bedroom in his mansion. After being given a gun by Kotterwell, Jackson commandeers a car being displayed at the party, crashes into the house, kills Dellaplane's butler/bodyguard, Cartier by ramming him into a wall as the latter fires at him, and roars upstairs to crash into the room Dellaplane is holding Sydney in. After a brief standoff, Dellaplane, (a trained martial artist) challenges Jackson to hand-to-hand combat. At first Dellaplane has the upper hand, but after ramming Jackson into a car window, he is abruptly shoved back by Jackson, who turns and shouts \\"Now you've pissed me off!\\" Jackson proceeds to thrash Dellaplane. In desperation, Dellaplane goes for his gun, only for Jackson to seize his own and engage in a crossfire exchange, with Jackson killing Dellaplane and receiving a wound in the shoulder in return. Captain Armbruster arrives with reinforcements, informs Jackson that he wants a full report on his desk \\"in the morning...\\" and calls Jackson \\"Lieutenant.\\" Sydney soon reveals she plans to go \\"cold turkey\\" off of heroin, promising Jackson can have her \\"on Thanksgiving.\\" Jackson replies, \\"Can I have you any sooner?\\" Sydney giggles and the two kiss passionately as the screen fades to black.

Queen Elizabeth National Park is known for its wildlife, including African buffalo, Ugandan kob, hippopotamus, giant forest hog, warthog, Nile crocodile, African bush elephant, African leopard, lion, and chimpanzee. It is home to 95 mammal species and over 500 bird species. The area around Ishasha in Rukungiri District is famous for its tree-climbing lions, whose males sport black manes. Poachers killed six elephants in the park in 2015, triggering both anger and frustration within the Ugandan conservation community. Queen Elizabeth National Park together with the adjacent Virunga National Park is a Lion Conservation Unit. The area is considered a potential lion stronghold in Central Africa, if poaching is curbed and prey species recover. The park is also famous for its volcanic features, including volcanic cones and deep craters, many with crater lakes, such as the Katwe craters, from which salt is extracted.

It was first performed Off-Broadway at the Truck and Warehouse Theater where it opened on June 30, 1970, closing on October 18, 1970 after 128 performances. This play presents the afterlife as a steam bath, in which recently deceased souls (who may not in every case realize that they are dead) continue to obsess about the same petty concerns that obsessed them in their lives. Ultimately, they are cast into another room offstage which is represented by a dark void by God, the steambath's Puerto Rican attendant, and with the help of his assistant Gottlieb. In the play, the new arrival Tandy at first refuses to accept what's happened, and when he finally does, he pleads to be allowed to return to his life. Steambath was controversial when first produced for its obscene language (which was softened for its television version), its satirical take on religion, and some brief nudity. Friedman claims to have been inspired to write the play in part because of a \\"bad experience with the food at a Chinese restaurant\\" that had him contemplating mortality. Cast Anthony Perkins directed the original production which starred Perkins as Tandy, Hector Elizondo as the Attendant (God), Marvin Lichterman as Bieberman, Annie Rachel as Meredith, Conrad Bain as Old Timer, Mitchell Jason as Broker, Jere Admire as Young Man, Teno Pollick as 2nd Young Man, Eileen Dietz as Young Girl, Alfred Hinckley as Flanders, Gabor Morea as Gottlieb, Jack Knight as Longshoreman, and William Walsh as 2nd Longshoreman. Miguel Pi√±ero would later play God. Elizondo won an Obie Award for his performance. Initially Charles Grodin was cast in the role of Tandy, but was replaced by Perkins. Coincidentally, Grodin soon landed his breakthrough role as a comedy actor in the film The Heartbreak Kid, based on a short story by Steambath author Friedman. Other media The play was then produced for PBS in 1973 with Jos√© P√©rez playing God, Bill Bixby playing Tandy, and Valerie Perrine as the blonde bombshell Meredith. Only 24 PBS affiliates carried the program. Steambath became a series on the cable network Showtime in 1983 starring Robert Picardo in the Tandy role, Janis Ward as Meredith, Al Ruscio as DaVinci, Rita Taggart as Blanche and Allen Williams as Gottlieb. Jos√© P√©rez reprised his role as God, who now also had a name, \\"Morty.\\" (A pilot was produced and aired, later followed by five additional episodes.) Along with Oh! Calcutta!, the play was spoofed as \\"Bathtub\\" in The Odd Couple episode \\"What Does a Naked Lady Say to You?\\" In Fame, Ralph performs an excerpt from Steambath as part of his audition for the High School of Performing Arts. We do not see the audition itself, only Ralph's introduction: \\"I'm God, see? And God is Puerto Rican, you got that? Now, God works in a casa de steam, you know. It's a steam bath, right? . . . I'm God, see? That's why I'm standing on this chair, you got that?

History The newspaper was founded in September 1996 by a group of Austria-based businessmen that included Peter Kelbel and Aleksandar Lup≈°iƒá, who simultaneously bought Bratislava's Nov√Ω ƒças though the original newspaper had been started a year before (in 1995, as weekly) and had drawn some journalists who had previously been working for Borba and Nasa Borba. At the time of his investment in Blic, Lup≈°iƒá had strong ties to Milo≈°eviƒá's wife Mira Markoviƒá and her party Yugoslav Left (JUL). The first issue of Blic appeared on September 16, 1996 thus becoming the 10th daily newspaper to be published in FR Yugoslavia at the time (the other nine being Politika, Borba, Dnevnik, Pobjeda, Narodne novine, Veƒçernje novosti, Politika ekspres, Na≈°a borba, and Dnevni telegraf). Prior to that, the same group took over a Prague newspaper where they gained valuable publishing experience which encouraged them to go on further. For their Serbian operation, the owners got seasoned journalist Manojlo \\"Manjo\\" Vukotiƒá to be the editor-in-chief. Just like many other media operations in Serbia from the 1990s and beyond, Blic's ownership structure was murky as well. It was controlled by an entity called Blic Press d.o.o. - a limited liability company registered in Belgrade in March 1996. Blic Press' owners according to the Serbian Business Register were listed to be Milorad Perovic, a resident of Belgrade (51%) and Liechtenstein-based company named Mitsui Securities Eastern Europe Fund AG (49%) whose owners were not listed.Sumrak \\"Blic\\" demokratije Starting out, Blic was a typical stripped- down tabloid with short and simple stories, as well as a lot of entertainment content. Its first issues were circulated in 50,000 copies per day with the price set at 1 dinar. It also ran a heavily advertised sweepstakes with the grand prize being a Volkswagen Polo Classic car and DM30,000. As a result of the sweepstakes, the paper's circulation increased by 30% within only a couple of weeks of the first issue. =1996‚Äì1997 protests= In November 1996, local municipal elections were held across Serbia. The opposition, headed by the DS and SPO, parties made big gains at the expense of Milo≈°eviƒá's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). Milo≈°eviƒá refused to recognize the results, thus sparking a huge outpouring of street protests. Blic capitalized on this to further its position on the market through fair coverage of the events ignored by the government-controlled media. The decision turned out to be a business winner in the short term as circulation rapidly grew to 200,000 copies a day, but it also drew the ire of the Milo≈°eviƒá authorities. In the circumstances when state media made virtually no mention of the protests and the reporting of the independent media was insufficient on the subject, Blic made a gutsy decision to devote a sizable part of its paper every day to the protests. The government responded immediately by restricting Blic's access to print and distribution facilities as the state printing house refused to print any more than 80,000 copies of the paper. The problem first appeared when it came time to print the 29 November 1996 holiday 4-day issue (FR Yugoslavia at the time still celebrated the old SFR Yugoslavia's day of the republic) as the state- owned Borba printing facility informed Blic staff that it's not able to print the holiday issue in the requested 235,000 copies \\"due to technical reasons\\" and instead offered to print about a third of that. The holiday issue still appeared on newsstands in projected circulation as some of it got printed at Borba and the rest in privately owned ABC Produkt. However, the issue that appeared was a complete whitewash, abandoning the paper's new concept and going back to entertainment and frivolity. Forty three journalists employed at Blic immediately publicly distanced themselves from the issue, and editor-in- chief Manjo Vukotiƒá and his deputy Cvijetin Milivojeviƒá resigned in protest. The most controversial part of the issue was the pro-government op-ed piece under the headline \\"Neƒáemo da podstiƒçemo nasilje\\" (We won't encourage violence) signed by Peter Kelbel who wrote it claiming to represent the paper's owners. In the piece he criticizes the protesters and indirectly supports the government, saying among other things that \\"Yugoslavia needs creative people and not wolves who follow the alpha wolf and hunt in packs\\" - a veiled reference to opposition leader Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá whose first name Vuk translates to \\"wolf\\". Clearly, since certain influential individuals within the state apparatus were unhappy with the paper's reporting, Blic made guarantees to decrease reporting on the protests and to decrease circulation for the time being. Blic publishers caved in under state pressure and drastically reduced the number of political pages. Blic owners faced a lot of criticism over their decision to give in to the authorities. The move was criticized by many of its journalists and editors along with the Serbian opposition. As a response, in December 1996, the journalists and editors formed their own newspaper Demokratija that had the support of opposition Democratic Party (DS).Blic krig, NIN, December 6, 1996 Still, Vukotiƒá and many of the staffers that originally distanced themselves from the paper returned to Blic shortly and for a few months put out a stripped-down version of the paper with only 60,000 copies printed each day. All in all, as a result of the unsavory episode, Blic quickly lost half its circulation, as well as many of its journalistic staff who resigned in protest. Blic then contracted a new printing house, resumed a critical line and soon increased its circulation to nearly 160,000.Jovanka Matiƒá: Problems facing Quality Press Development in Serbia =Glas javnosti= In April 1998, Blic experienced another fragmentation of its staff when due to disagreements with owner Aca Lup≈°iƒá over revenue sharing, editor-in-chief Manjo Vukotiƒá decided to step out on his own. Majority of the staff followed him. They then hooked up with another businessman Radisav Rodiƒá (owner of the printing company ABC Produkt that printed daily issues of Blic and its offshoots) and under his financial backing started a new paper called Glas javnosti (the first five issues were called Novi Blic). Rodiƒá thus entered the world of newspaper publishing. =New ownership: Gruner+Jahr= In November 2000, shortly after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in Serbia, German publishing firm Gruner + Jahr announced its purchase of 49% stake in Blic Press d.o.o. from Aca Lup≈°iƒá and his partners. At the time of the transaction, the paper's circulation was announced to be 175,000 copies daily.GERMAN PUBLISHER BUYS 49 PER CENT SHARE IN 'BLIC';B92, 14 November 2000 =Ringier buyout= Blic got sold to Swiss multimedia communications group Ringier in early 2004 (takeover finalized in October 2004). =The 'Suitcase' affair= In early 2006, Blic created a storm of controversy by claiming in its 4 February 2006 issue that the 11 January arrest of Dejan Simiƒá, National Bank of Serbia vice-governor (who was taken in red-handed at his apartment while accepting a ‚Ç¨100,000 bribe from Vladimir Zagraƒëanin of SPS), actually had a completely different background from what the police and Serbian government authorities told the public. The newspaper alleged that Du≈°an Laliƒá, an NBS employee and deputy PM Miroljub Labus' son- in-law, was actually the individual behind the bribing. The story further alleged that deputy PM Labus spent an entire night convincing Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica not to prosecute his son-in-law. And finally, the story also accused Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Joƒçiƒá of stopping the police investigation from climbing up the chain of command and thus preventing the arrests of NBS governor Radovan Jela≈°iƒá and the above-mentioned Du≈°an Laliƒá, as well as SPS' Ivica Daƒçiƒá who was present in the mentioned apartment minutes before the police stormed in. The paper voiced its fear that the minority coalition government, which held a shaky 5-seat parliamentary support at the time, would fall as Joƒçiƒá's motivation for disrupting the thorough police action.Blic nastavlja priƒçu All of the parties concerned (Labus, Laliƒá, Joƒçiƒá, Jela≈°iƒá, and Daƒçiƒá) vehemently rubbished the story, with Labus announcing immediate legal action against Blic for libel. In March 2007, the parent company announced Blic's average daily circulation during the 2006 calendar year to be 180,948.Blic pres planira rast prihoda;B92, 30 March 2007 =Ratko Kne≈æeviƒá interview= On July 27, 2009, Blic published an interview with Ratko Kne≈æeviƒá, former Montenegrin trade representative in Washington, D.C. and former close friend of Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá (Kne≈æeviƒá was the best man at ƒêukanoviƒá's wedding). The Blic interview came couple of days after Kne≈æeviƒá gave a similarly explosive interview to Montenegrin daily Vijesti in which he effectively accused ƒêukanoviƒá and his associate Stanko Subotiƒá of ordering the October 2008 murder of Croatian journalist Ivo Pukaniƒá. Kne≈æeviƒá also provided many alleged details of the decades-long cigarette smuggling operation, ƒêukanoviƒá had been involved in. Conducted by journalist Nenad Jaƒáimoviƒá, the focus of the Blic interview was on cigarette smuggling operations through Serbia during the 1990s and its political fallout that continues to this day. In the interview, Kne≈æeviƒá accused ƒêukanoviƒá, Subotiƒá and their \\"cigarette smuggling cartel\\" of defrauding the Serbian budget of ‚Ç¨300 million in unpaid taxes with the help of Jovica Stani≈°iƒá, Serbian former state security chief and Milo≈°eviƒá's second in command.Stani≈°iƒá i Cane ojadili Srbiju za 300 miliona evra, Blic, July 27, 2009 Kne≈æeviƒá further alleged that since the regime change in Serbia, ƒêukanoviƒá and Subotiƒá needed a \\"friendly\\" government in Belgrade and to that end tried their best for years to reach a deal with Serbian president Boris Tadiƒá and his circle. After allegedly getting nowhere with Tadiƒá, according to Kne≈æeviƒá, they then turned their attention to other players on the Serbian political scene such as Tomislav Nikoliƒá and Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá who met with ƒêukanoviƒá and Subotiƒá during October 2007 in Paris' Ritz Hotel. Furthermore, according to Kne≈æeviƒá, for this ƒêukanoviƒá and Subotiƒá had the support of former DGSE intelligence operative Arnaud Danjean. Kne≈æeviƒá also claimed that the cigarette cartel also poses a security threat to Boris Tadiƒá and that even Croatian president Stipe Mesiƒá gave Tadiƒá documents during their meeting in Sofia on April 25, 2009 warning him of possible attacks on him.Kne≈æeviƒá o poku≈°ajima preuzimanja vlasti: Duvanska mafija preti Tadiƒáu, Blic, July 28, 2009 Subotiƒá announced that he would sue Blic for libel.Subotiƒá: Tu≈æiƒáu ‚ÄûBlic‚Äú kao ≈°to sam ‚ÄûNacional‚Äú, Blic, July 30, 2009 After Subotiƒá wrote a press release that was distributed in Balkan print media outlets on August 11, 2009, in which he denies Kne≈æeviƒá's charges and further questions Kne≈æeviƒá's and Blic editor-in- chief Veselin Simonoviƒá's professional and moral credibility,pismo medijima povodom pisanja ‚ÄûBlica‚Äù - Subotiƒá: Dr≈æava da ispita optu≈æbe Ratka Kne≈æeviƒáa, Blic, August 11, 2009 Kne≈æeviƒá wrote a lengthy response saying that he stands by every word from his Vijesti, Blic and NIN interviews. In the same response, Kne≈æeviƒá also provided further details of the murders of Radovan \\"Bad≈æa\\" Stojiƒçiƒá, Jusuf \\"Jusa\\" Buliƒá, Vanja Bokan, Goran ≈Ωugiƒá, Darko \\"Beli\\" Raspopoviƒá, and Blagota \\"Baja\\" Sekuliƒá (all of which he claimed are connected to cigarette smuggling with the murders of Stojiƒçiƒá, Buliƒá, and Bokan directly ordered and approved by Stani≈°iƒá, Subotiƒá, and ƒêukanoviƒá) by directly naming the individuals that carried them out as well as those that ordered them.Odgovor Ratka Kne≈æeviƒáa Stanku Subotiƒáu: Cane i Milo uklonili sve protivnike, Blic, August 12, 2009 Editorial history *Manjo Vukotiƒá (1996-1998) *Veselin Simonoviƒá (1998 - 2014) *Marko Stjepanoviƒá (2014-2016) *Predrag Mihailoviƒá (since 2016) See also *List of Serbian newspapers *Alo! *Glas javnosti References External links *Blic online portal *Ringier Axel Springer Srbija, the paper's publisher Category:Newspapers published in Serbia Category:Publications established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Serbia Category:Serbian news websites ","title":"Blic"},{"id":"2069011","text":"State Route 147 (SR 147) is a state highway serving the Las Vegas Valley in southern Nevada. It is signed as Lake Mead Boulevard and runs from Interstate 15 (I-15) and U.S. Route 93 (US 93) in North Las Vegas east to the border of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. It is not to be confused with Lake Mead Parkway (formerly Lake Mead Drive), which also goes to Lake Mead but mainly runs in southern Las Vegas Valley and carries the designation of State Route 564. Lake Mead Boulevard became a state highway in 1978, but the highway never had markers posted to identify it as a state highway. Route description View eastbound along SR 147 at milepost 10 in 2015 State Route 147 begins at Interstate 15 and U.S. Route 93 in North Las Vegas. From there, SR 147 has an intersection at Las Vegas Boulevard (SR 604) and Civic Center Drive (former SR 607). Traveling further east, SR 147 leaves the city of North Las Vegas as it enters the unincorporated town of Sunrise Manor where it has intersections at Lamb Boulevard and Nellis Boulevard (SR 612). The highway then leaves the unincorporated town of Sunrise Manor as it travels through the Frenchman Mountain on its northern slope. The road then curves into a southeastern direction where the highway ends near the Lake Mead NRA as Lake Mead Boulevard continues beyond the highway's eastern terminus. History Las Vegas seen from where SR 147 passes over the north shoulder of Frenchman Mountain in 2006 SR 147 first appears on the official Nevada state highway map with the 1978-79 edition as a semi-circular route. The route followed Lake Mead Boulevard (which was previously unnumbered) eastward from North Las Vegas to North Shore Road in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area; south on North Shore Road (replacing SR 41A) to Lakeshore Road; then west on Lakeshore Road (later Lake Mead Drive, now Lake Mead Parkway), replacing part of SR 41. The terminus was at Lakeshore Road and Boulder Highway (then US 93/US 95, now SR 582). The highway continued west of Boulder Highway as SR 146. The northern section along Lake Mead Boulevard lacks the SR 147 designator on the 1983‚Äì84 and 1985-86 maps. However, it is back on the 1987-88 map, so it is unclear whether this was a map error or possibly a planned decommissioning that wasn‚Äôt carried out. On the 1998-99 map, the southern section of SR 147 (along Lake Mead Drive) was replaced by an eastward extension of SR 146 (now SR 564). The entire length of SR 147 is now on Lake Mead Boulevard, with the eastern terminus truncated to the northern border of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.

He had originally ordained within a monastery recognized by the Thai Sangha, but soon left with a small following to form this group, which he sees as a mixture of both Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. Described by Donald Swearer as \\"a radical sectarian movement\\" that \\"reflects the forest tradition's ideals of simplicity\\", the tradition also claimed an early influence from Buddhadasa, which it later rejected. History Samana Phothirak was once a bhikkhu of Dhammayuttika Nikaya, but his preceptor refused to take care of him after finding he had repeatedly breached the Buddhist doctrines. Phothirak then resorted to Maha Nikaya at Wat Nong Krathum (), Nakhon Pathom Province. As he still repeatedly contravened the doctrines, the community of Thai monks requested the Supreme Sangha Council (SSC) to look into the case. Several inquisitorial panels were set up to investigate the monks' complaints and a decision was made that the SSC should exercise the authority under the Sangha Act, BE 2505 (1962), section 27, to defrock Phothirak. On June 10, 1989, Ariyavangsagatayana, 18th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and SSC President, commanded Phothirak to leave order within seven days. Sano Phuangphinyo (), Deputy Director General of the Department of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Education, notified Phothirak of the command in person, but Phothirak refused to observe it and declared his secession from the Sangha. He then formed Asoke and established four monasteries: (1) Santi Asoke Monastery at Khet Bang Kapi, Bangkok; (2) Si Asok Monastery at Kantharalak District, Sisaket Province; (3) Sali Asok Monastery at Phaisali District, Nakhon Sawan Province; and (4) Phathomma Asok Monastery at Mueang Nakhon Pathom District, Nakhon Pathom Province. The monasteries consist of temples, pavilions and parsonages as on a par with wats. The Asoke accepted to perform ordination for those wishing to be Buddhist monks, despite the fact that it was not authorised by the laws or Buddhist disciplines to do so. At that time, more than 100 men and women were ordained by Phothirak. Phothirak also enacted his own disciplines, called \\"Rules for Asoke Followers.\\" Phothirak followers, whom Phothirak considered as legitimate Buddhist monks and nuns, wore the same robes as the Buddhist monks. Deputy Director General Phuangphinyo then filed a complaint before the Lat Phrao Metropolitan Police, and the warrants of arrest were issued for Phothirak and his 104 followers. They were arrested on August 8, 1989, and 80 prosecutions were then instituted against them before the Northern Phra Nakhon Municipal Court. The court found that the 1st-79th Defendants (Phothirak followers) were guilty of the religious offenses under the Criminal Code, section 208 (not being a Buddhist monk, but dressing up as a Buddhist monk in order to deceive another into believing that the offender is a Buddhist monk), and sentenced each of them to imprisonment for 3 months. The 80th Defendant (Phothirak himself) was found guilty of aiding in the commission of the said criminal acts on 33 counts, and was sentenced to serve two months on each count consecutively; he was imprisoned for 66 months in total. The judgment was later affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Justice. The latter court decided on June 15, 1998, that: > The fact that the 80th Defendant has been ordained as a monk of Thammayutika > Nikai Sect...and...later, a monk of Maha Nikai Sect, indicates his agreement > to comply with the Sangha Act, BE 2505 (1962), and the regulations of the > Supreme Sangha Council. And at that time, the 80th Defendant was capable of > observing the said laws, and it did not appear that he was persecuted or > otherwise debarred from following the Buddhist disciplines.

The earliest hymns are those of the founder, Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu'. While the rituals and music originated with a very few hymns, sung by a small group in the Brazilian Amazon, the practice of these spiritual works in diverse parts of the world since it began expansion around the beginning of the 1990s has given rise to a significant body of music, in many languages. Daimistas from Brazil and other countries have contributed to this growing genre, while continuing to sing the principle hinarios in Portuguese. Among adherents to the doctrine, songs tend to be referred to as 'received' from a spiritual source rather than written from the writers mind alone and confirmed by their use in ritual. Variously these hymns may be viewed as 'calling' energies or divine entities, as transmitting sacred doctrine, as bringing healing through the act of singing what the community is affirming are eternal truths. In the spiritual works and communities of Santo Daime, the hymns are a bond of shared understanding and a daily practice. New hymns are often introduced in ceremony by those who receive them, by the leader's invitation. A Santo Daime hin√°rio (Portuguese) or hymn-book (hinario), can be a life work of its owner, chronicling that person's spiritual journey. During a ritual, one or several hin√°rios or compilations may be sung in their entirety. While they are sung outside of the rituals in ensaio (practice) and listened to in various settings, the real distinction of is genre is that it is intended to be sung in ritual, by a group going into what is understood to be spiritual work of transformation. The hymns can be seen as integral to the ritual, the transformation, and the revealed messages as each person understands them. Hinarios that are central to the doctrine may be sung once or several times per year, and practiced many times more.  Calendar of official hinarios  Mestre Irineu on the Virgin of Conception (Dec. 7), Christmas, Day of Kings (January 6), St. John (June 23). The hinario of Padrinho Sebastiao is sung on Irineu's birthday (Dec. 15), Saint Sebastian (January 19), Madrinha Rita's birthday (June 25), as well as Brazilian Father's Day. Padrinho Alfredo's hinario is sung on Padrinho Alfredo's birthday (January 7), St. Joseph (March 18), and Saint Peter (June 28), as well as New Year's Eve (December 31) Historical Hinarios =Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu'= 'O Cruzeiro' (The Cross), 'Cruzeirinho' (The Little Cross) and 'A Santa Missa' (The Holy Mass) The first part of Mestre Irineu's hin√°rio, O Cruzeiro, contains hymns up to number 116. After an interval of 11 years he received hymns 117 through 128, which are now known as the Cruzeirinho or occasionally as the Hinos Novos. After the time of Mestre Irineu it became a more common practice to finish or close an hinario as a complete work, after which a new hinario might be received. =Sebasti√£o Mota de Melo - 'Padrinho Sebasti√£o'= 'O Justiceiro' and 'Nova Jerusalem' (The New Jerusalem) Nova Jerusalem is the second and final hinario of Padrinho Sebasti√£o, consisting of 26 hymns. =Rita Greg√≥rio de Melo- 'Madrinha Rita'= 'Lua Branca' (White Moon) Rita Greg√≥rio de Melo is the widow of Padrinho Sebasti√£o, matriarch of the CEFLURIS line, mother of 11 children, and lives in C√©u do Mapi√°.

He was born 7 January 1950 in the seringal (rubber extraction area) Ad√©lia along the Juru√° river in the state of Amazonas. =Jo√£o Pedro= Jo√£o Pedro was a contemporary of Mestre Irineu.

She was very young when she moved with her family to Rio Branco, Acre, where she met Mestre Irineu, in the early 1930s. She was sallow and blond with white skin. Maria Dami√£o, as she was known, married and had seven children (one adopted) but lost her husband early. She worked hard to support her family but had many difficulties in her material life, as in her works with Santo Daime. She died of pneumonia, aged just 32 years, on 2 April 1949. =Ant√¥nio Gomes= 'O Amor Divino' (The Divine Love) Ant√¥nio Gomes da Silva was born in Cear√°, 30 April 1885. He married Maria de Nazar√© in Cear√°, and had five children. He lived in Bel√©m do Par√° for a while, and then moved to Rio Branco, Acre, in 1921. He worked as a seringueiro, or rubber tapper, and later as a farmer. He lost his first wife, married again, and had another four children. He met Mestre Irineu in 1938, and he received benefits for his unstable health. Ant√¥nio Gomes then became a member of the Santo Daime doctrine, as did his whole family. His son Le√¥ncio became the new leader of Alto Santo, after Mestre Irineu's death, in 1971. His granddaughter, Peregrina Gomes, was the third wife of Mestre Irineu. Ant√¥nio Gomes da Silva died 14 August 1946. =Germano Guilherme= 'V√≥s Sois Baliza' (Thou art a Beacon) Germano Guilherme dos Santos was born in Piau√≠ at the beginning of the 20th century. He moved with his family to Rio Branco, Acre, where he lived on the outskirts of the city working as a farmer. Germano was one of the first disciples of Mestre Irineu, becoming a member of Santo Daime in the 1930s. He was a black man with notably white teeth. Germano had special feelings for Mestre Irineu, and called him maninho, or 'my little brother'. He suffered a disease on his leg that bothered him a lot. Because of this, he couldn't eat some kinds of food. But when he was at maninho's house, Germano ate everything he wanted and didn't feel anything. He was married to Cec√≠lia Gomes, the daughter of Ant√¥nio Gomes and Maria de Nazar√©, but had no children. His hin√°rio is sung at CICLU - Alto Santo along with the O Cruzeiro hin√°rio of Mestre Irineu. Germano Guilherme dos Santos died in 1964. =Jo√£o Pereira= 'Seis de Janeiro' (January 6; which is King's day, or Epiphany) Jo√£o Pereira was born in Porongaba, Cear√°, in the end of the 19th century. Nobody knows the date he moved to Rio Branco, Acre. In the early 1930s, he joined Mestre Irineu, and became one of his first disciples. Jo√£o Pereira was almost bald, and his complexion was swarthy or similar to that of caboclos, the mixed blood people of the Amazonian region. He worked as a farmer and wagon driver. He lived near Rio Branco and was married with Maria Franco (Maria Marques Feitosa), the mother of the second wife of Mestre Irineu, Raimunda. Jo√£o Pereira died in 1954. =Tet√©u/Teteo (Francisco Fernandes Filho)= After Mestre Irineu passed on, his last wife's uncle Le√¥ncio Gomes assumed command of the works, and in turn after Le√¥ncio Gomes' passing, Francisco Fernandes Filho (Tet√©u or Teteo) took over; however, he apparently very soon quarreled with Mestre Irineu's widow, Dona Peregrina Gomes Serra, and was chased out of Mestre Irineu's house (Alto Santo), according to Edward MacRae. Tet√©u then founded a new center less than a kilometer away, declaring himself to be the real CICLU. Following Sr. Luis Mendes' presidency, Tet√©u's eventual successor, Mr. Jo√£o Rodrigues Facundes (who was also involved in the initial dispute), returned the legal name and charter of CICLU to Dona Peregrina. Known for sleeping light and little, Tet√©u received his nickname after a bird (Vanellus chilensis) commonly called \\"Tet√©u\\" who was also believed to not sleep much. His hinario O Assesor has 132 hymns, including a number of Daime serving hymns (Eu Tomo Daime, O Daime Me Balan√ßou, Mesa De Centro, Daime √© O Nosso Pai, Um, Dois E Tr√™s) and is sung in some churches, where it is known, to honor the passing of Mestre Irineu on July 6. Where it is not known well, Mestre Irineu's hinario O Cruzeiro, is sung (a Capella in the churches of Sr. Luis Mendes). =Maria Brilhante= Maria Brilhante was married with Padrinho Eduardo Salles Freitas, and they had four children, three of whom survive. Madrinha Maria Brilhante received a hin√°rio which is officially sung on the festival of St. Anthony every 12-13 June. Some Contemporary Hin√°rios =Baixinha= 'Guia Mestre' (Master Guide), 'Mensageiros da Cura' (Messengers of Healing), 'Hin√°rio da F√©' (Hinario of the Faith), 'Estrela D'√Ågua' (Star of the Water. Baixinha's new hinario) Baixinha, tiny in Portuguese, is perhaps the best known practitioner of UmbanDaime. She is a small woman of scarcely one and a half meters, who has spent more than forty years in Umbanda, twenty-one in Candombl√©, and eighteen years in Santo Daime. Despite her small stature, she was known by many as a true spiritual beacon and traveled extensively, even after she'd become very old. She led a spiritual community in Lumiar, a mountain village two hours from Rio de Janeiro until her passage in 2015 working in two worlds (spiritual and physical) and two doctrines (Daimista and Umbandista). =Glauco Villas Boas= 'O Chaveirinho' & 'O Chaveir√£o' Hin√°rio received by prominent cartoonist Glauco Villas Boas (March 10, 1957 - March 12, 2010), commander of the C√©u de Maria church in S√£o Paulo, and consisting of 41 hymns in O Chaveirinho and 11 in O Chaveir√£o. Glauco came from a family of legends, and became a legend in his own right. As one of the most recognizable and timely artists of Brazil in the late 20th century, he formed a bond with fellow cartoonists Laerte and Angeli that produced a significant, massive body of work over decades. As daily political cartoonist for Folha de S√£o Paulo (Sao Paulo's principal daily newspaper), he was looked to by Paulistas to interpret and shed light on the news of the day in his own courageous, take-no-prisoners style. While participating in early works at Flor das Aguas in Itapecerica da Serra (SP), Glauco inaugurated Ceu de Maria in his own home, then built a church on a peak high above Sao Paulo called Pico do Jaragu√°. An accomplished musician, he was well known for his fiery accordion playing and said that he had never once practiced outside of ceremony, relying instead on the force of the Daime to pull the music. =Alex Polari= 'Nova Anuncia√ß√£o' Alex Polari spent years as a political prisoner during the rule of the military junta in Brazil, enduring torture, brutality, and deprivation. His quest for spiritual initiation eventually led him deep into the heart of the rainforest, to Mapi√°, where he became a teacher and leader of the Santo Daime community. He is the author of 'Forest of Visions: Ayahuasca, Amazonian Spirituality, and the Santo Daime Tradition' which has been translated into English. =Paulo Roberto= Luz na Escurid√£o (A Light In The Darkness) is the first hin√°rio (of four) received by Paulo Roberto (Paulo Roberto Silva e Souza), padrinho of the C√©u do Mar church in Rio de Janeiro. Selections from Hinarios (often sung as part of rituals) =Ora√ß√£o= Ora√ß√£o simply means prayer. In Daimista communities and households, it is normally sung around 6:30pm, in church or at home, with or without instruments. The ora√ß√£o of CEFLURIS consists of a selection of 12 hymns from Padrinho Sebasti√£o's O Justiceiro hin√°rio (or hymnbook), plus one from his son Padrinho Alfredo's O Cruzeirinho hin√°rio, and a new one from Sebasti√£o's daughter Madrinha Nonata. =Cura= (Divided into parts I and II) The Cura is a selection of 32 healing hymns in two parts, taken mainly from the hin√°rios of Padrinho Sebasti√£o, Madrinha Rita, and Padrinho Alfredo, but also including a few from Mestre Irineu, Alex Polari, Vera Froes and Madrinha Tet√™ (Teresa Greg√≥rio), often used on occasions when healing is required, in particular physical healing. =Finados= Finados is a compendium of the hinarios of Antonio Gomes, Maria Dami√£o, Germano Guilherme and Jo√£o Pereira, among the earliest followers of Mestre Irineu.

Near the poblacion, or town plaza, the road passes along the Mabini river or (Balincaguing River), which drains into the South China Sea further west. The town plaza is home to a centuries-old Roman Catholic church, as well as one of the first congregations of the Philippine Independent Church. The town shares borders with the town of Bani to the north, the town of Mabini and Alaminos City to the east and with Burgos to the south. The town's main livelihood is fishing and agriculture, although a number of her sons and daughters work as doctors, physical therapist, nurses, engineers, computer programmers and accountants in numerous countries around the globe. On top of that, the town produces successful teachers, policemen and policewomen, and lawyers. During the summer months of April and May the town's market abounds with fresh fruits such as mangoes and duhat, as well as fresh catch such as tuna, flying fish, grouper, lobsters and other seafood. The town is home to natural attractions such as the Mabini river, the Umbrella Rocks in Sabangan, as well as several beaches, Agno Beach being the longest and most popular. There are several other beaches hidden along the coast such as the Macaboboni cove (which features a small cave) as well as a white beach in Barangay Gayusan. To the southern end of Agno Beach, one can dive from a two-story-high rock amidst crashing waves and end up in a beautiful coral garden below. Arthur Cabantac was the mayor of Agno from 2007 until he was shot in 2008 while playing Mahjong. He was then succeeded by Jose N. Pajeta Jr, the town's vice mayor during that time. History The name Agno was derived from a species of swamp tree called ‚ÄúAgno Casto‚Äù, a chaste tree used for medicinal concoctions to relieve pain and illness, that grew abundantly in the locality. In time, ‚ÄúAgno‚Äù was retained to become the name of the town. Agno was formally organized into municipality in 1791. During the Spanish regime and early part of the American era, Agno was part of the Province of Zambales, but upon enactment of Public Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903, of the Philippine Commission, the northern part of Zambales including Agno was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality was named after Spanish governor- general Rafael Mar√≠a de Aguilar, who ordered the establishment of an independent civil political unit on 16 July 1805. History The Municipality of Aguilar had its early beginnings as cattle ranch founded by the Spaniards. The place was known then as Sitio Balubad, which was then still part of the town of Binalatongan (now San Carlos). On the western part were the Zambales Mountains with thick forests and verdant foliage. It was hunter's paradise with deer roaming here and there with an occasional wild boar making an appearance. The grass in the plains were succulent fare for fattening cattle and the water from the brooks and streams clear and sparkling. On the eastern part was the Agno River. At that time, there were no roads were yet established. There were footpaths which eventually roads providing access from one place to another. The river arteries constituted the main mode of transportation in the interior towns. Through these river systems, boats sailed from the Ilocos provinces in the North southwards to Dagupan, Calasiao, Lingayen and sometimes even as far as San Isidro De Labrador, Salasa, Aguilar and Camiling. Worth noting was the fossiliferous river bank in Camiling useful in making lime, while mineral waters consisting of ferruginous and alkaline waters were and are still found in Aguilar and Mangatarem. As a thriving place for cattle and bountiful rice harvests, it was natural for Aguilar to attract people from other towns to stay and settle in the place. The early settlers prospered and lived in peace and contentment. When the Spaniards in Lingayen heard of this flourishing village, they sent Spanish explorers through the town of Salasa to visit the place. Some Spanish soldiers and priest were left to organize a pueblo. In time, the clamor to convert the settlement into a town became popular. A petition was therefore, filed with the principales or municipal officials of Binalatongan to convert the village into a town. The petition was finally favorably endorsed. The decree establishing Aguilar as an independent civil political unit was issued on 16 July 1805 by Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar, after whom the town was named. The decree in Lingayen on 1 August 1805. However, it was not until 19 January 1806 that the Provincial Governor of Pangasinan was able to make the trip to the sitio of Balubad, the site of the Poblacion, to carry out the provisions of the decree. The Governor inspected the area, chose the most appropriate site on which to erect the town center and listed the people who wishes to settle in the new town, together with their places of origin. The greatest number came from Lingayen, made up of 210 couples and 60 individuals from the \\"gremio de naturals\\" (native community) and 10 couples and 11 individuals from the \\"gremio de mestizos\\" (mestizo community). From the town of Salasa, there were 56 couples and 21 bachelors all of the rank of \\"Caylianes\\" (commoners), while from the town of San Carlos, there were 32 couples and 19 individuals, all \\"Caylianes\\". There were also Ilocano migrants consisting of 6 couples and 24 bachelors. Finally, there were some Negritos, consisting of both baptized Christians and Ynfieles (Non-Christians). All in all, the total number of inhabitants composed 401 tributes, for bachelors and unmarried women paid only half a tribute each. These excluded the unbaptized negritos. The town was formally inaugurated on 9 May 1806 when the first officials were elected and given their appointments by the Alcalde Mayor. The officials were headed by Don Francisco Zamuco as Gobernadorcillo and Don Juan Manguino as \\"Teniente Primero\\" (first lieutenant). The Alcalde Mayor then proceeded to mark the jurisdictional limits of the new town. With the town of Salasa, the boundary was the river Balubad (now Sobol) from the mountain where the river originated to the river Agno, running a direct line from west to east. With the town of San Carlos, the boundary was the Agno River in the east and the Bunlalacao River in the south. The necessary boundary markers were placed and operations were witnessed by the town officials of Salasa and San Carlos. Mangatarem as a town did not yet exist, having been founded only in 1837. Local folklores likewise maintained that Aguilar was identified with an eagle or agila that used to fly around the place at nighttime and would perch on a fence or alar when tired of flying, hence, agila and alar put together formed Aguilar.Aguilar .

Retrieved April 9, 2012 =Leadership by the Principales= Although the population of Aguilar was drawn from different places, the leadership of the town was furnished by the elite families, the principales who had moved from Lingayen to Aguilar in 1805.

But in all these new towns, the initiative for and leadership in building the new town came from the Pangasinan native-born elite. =Polos or Forced Labor in Local Infrastructures= The Gobernadorcillo usually took charge of public works and improvements in the town. This included the building and repair of public structures, including churches and convents, as well as construction and repair of roads and bridges under the parish curate's supervision.

History What is known now as Alcala was formerly a barrio of Bayambang, formerly called \\"Dangla\\", a vernacular term referring to a medicinal shrub which grows abundantly in the place. As a barrio, it was subdivided into several smaller units called sitios, namely: Bugyao, Bacud, Cupi, Bitulao, Cabicalan, Patalan, Camanggaan and Sinabaan On April 1, 1873, the settlers established a community. They submitted a petition calling for the cessation of Dangla into a separate township, but it took more than two years for the Spanish Authorities to take notice of the settlers' demands. Finally, on September 20, 1875, a Royal Decree No. 682 was issued making the place an official municipality to be named Alcala, the name of a town in Spain where the then Governor of Pangasinan hailed from. During the outbreak of the Philippine-American War, the place was the site of the field headquarters of General Malone of the United States Army. When the Filipinos and Americans were fighting against the Japanese during World War II, the place was the site for the American Field Headquarters under the command of General Johnathan Wainwright. It is here that the first Guerrilla Combat Training School was established. The same school produced an Infantry Battalion composed mostly of Alcaleneans who played an important role in defending the whole of Northern Luzon from the superior Japanese Forces.

Brefeldin A inhibits protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi complex indirectly by preventing association of COP-I coat to the Golgi membrane. Brefeldin A was initially isolated with hopes to become an antiviral drug but is now primarily used in research to study protein transport.  History  The compound gets its name from a species of anamorph fungus of the Penicillium genus known as Eupenicillium brefeldianum, though it is found in a variety of species that span several genera. It was first isolated from Penicillium decumbens in 1958 by V.L. Singleton who initially called it Decumbin. It was later identified as a metabolite by H.P. Siggs who then went on to identify the chemical structure of the compound in 1971. Since then several successful total synthesis methods have been described. Interest in researching brefeldin A was initially lacking due to poor antiviral activity. However, upon discovery of its mechanism involving disruption of protein transport by Takatsuki and Tamura in 1985 and the cytotoxic effects observed in certain cancer cell lines, research efforts were revitalized. It is currently used solely in research mainly as an assay tool for studying membrane traffic and vesicle transport dynamics between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Physical properties and storage information Brefeldin A is found naturally as a white to off-white crystalline solid. It forms a clear colorless solution when dissolved. It is soluble in methanol (10 mg/mL), ethanol (5 mg/mL), DMSO (20 mg/mL), acetone, and ethyl acetate (1 mg/mL) without the aid of heating. It is poorly soluble in water (slightly miscible). It is sold commercially with a purity of 98% or greater. It is recommended that it be stored desiccate at -20 ¬∞C away from direct sunlight. Its suggested shelf life for use is 6 months as a solid and 1 month as a solution with tightly sealed storage at -20 ¬∞C. Since the compound is combustible, contamination with oxidizing agents should be avoided to prevent the risk of fire. Direct contact should be avoided as well.  Mechanism of action  Brefeldin A inhibits vesicle formation and transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus which ultimately results in collapse of the Golgi apparatus into the endoplasmic reticulum via membrane fusion. In mammalian and yeast cells, the main target of brefeldin A appears to be a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) called GBF1.https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GBF1 GBF1 is a member of the Arf family of GEFs which are recruited to membranes of the Golgi. It is responsible for the regulation of Arf1p GTPase. It does this through converting the inactive GDP-bound form of Arf1p to the active GTP-bound form. The nucleotide exchange occurs at the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1. Activated Arf1p then recruits coat protein Œ≤-COP, a subunit of the COP-I complex, to cargo-bound receptors on the membrane. Coat protein recruitment is necessary for proper vesicle formation and transport. Brefeldin A reversibly inhibits the function of GBF1 uncompetitively by binding to the complex it forms with GDP-bound Arf1p and preventing conversion to the GTP-bound form. The lack of active Arf1p prevents coat protein recruitment, which then ultimately induces the fusion of neighboring ER and Golgi membranes due to lack of vesicle formation. This is because lack of vesicle formation results in a buildup of SNARE proteins in the Golgi which would otherwise be bound to coat protein- coated vesicles and removed with the vesicles once they bud off. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion and it is postulated that the described SNARE build up in the Golgi increases the chances of aberrant fusion of the Golgi membrane with that of the ER. The collapse of the Golgi into the ER triggers activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) (or ER stress) which can result in apoptosis.  Toxicity  The toxological effects of brefeldin A have not been studied extensively yet. Some animal LD50 values have been reported including 250 mg/kg in mice (interperitoneal) and 275 mg/kg in rats (oral). Generally, antibiotic macrolides that share a similar macrocyclic lactone ring to that of brefeldin A have been shown to produce gastrointestinal discomfort as the most common side effect. Some macrolides have been shown to produce allergic reactions and though uncommon this possibility in the case of brefeldin A cannot be disregarded as of yet. The compound may bind to hemoglobin and inhibit oxygen uptake resulting in methemoglobinemia, a form of oxygen starvation, though this is not confirmed. Brefeldin A is not considered to be harmful from direct skin or eye exposure other than transient irritation. It may cause irritation of the respiratory system if inhaled.

This reaction is named after Erik Christian Clemmensen, a Danish chemist.Biographies of Chemists, accessed 6 Feb 2007 The Clemmensen reduction The original Clemmensen reduction conditions are particularly effective at reducing aryl-alkyl ketones,; Vol. 15, p.64 (1935); Vol. 33, p.17 (1953). such as those formed in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The two-step sequence of Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by Clemmensen reduction constitutes a classical strategy for the primary alkylation of arenes. With aliphatic or cyclic ketones, modified Clemmensen conditions using activated zinc dust in an anhydrous solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether or acetic anhydride is much more effective.; Vol. 53, p.86 (1973). The substrate must be tolerant of the strongly acidic conditions of the Clemmensen reduction (37% HCl). Several alternatives are available. Acid-sensitive substrates that are stable to strong base can be reduced using the Wolff-Kishner reduction; a further, milder method for substrates stable to hydrogenolysis in the presence of Raney nickel is the two-step Mozingo reduction. In spite of the antiquity of this reaction, the mechanism of the Clemmensen reduction remains obscure. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the reaction, mechanistic studies are difficult, and only a handful of studies have been disclosed. Mechanistic proposals generally invoke organozinc intermediates, sometimes including zinc carbenoids, either as discrete species or as organic fragments bound to the zinc metal surface. However, the corresponding alcohol is believed not to be an intermediate, since subjection of the alcohol to Clemmensen conditions generally does not afford the alkane product.

The paper borrowed many elements from weekly news magazines, such as many large photos and at first was bound with staples. In an attempt to be free of pressure from business interests, it did not accept advertising. These departures from the norms of newspaper publishing created excitement in the industry. Some 11,000 people applied for the 150 jobs available when the publication first hired staff.  Publication history  The origin of the name is unknown, although Ingersoll recalled that it probably referred to the fact that the paper appeared in the afternoon; The New Yorker reported that the name had been suggested by Lillian Hellman. (There is no historical evidence for the suggestion that the name was an abbreviation of Picture Magazine.) The first year of the paper was a general success, though it was already in some financial trouble: its circulation of 100,000‚Äì200,000 was insufficient. Circulation averaged 165,000, but the paper never managed to sell the 225,000 copies a day it needed to break even. Marshall Field III had become the paper's funder; quite unusually, he was a \\"silent partner\\" in this continually money-losing undertaking. According to a June 21, 1966, memo from Ingersoll: PM was sold in 1948 and published its final issue on June 22. The next day it was replaced by the New York Star, which folded on January 28, 1949. Politics 1942 World War II political cartoon by Dr. Seuss There were accusations that the paper was Communist- dominated, but others have concluded that the paper frequently opposed the policies of the Communist Party (CP) and engaged into editorial battles with the CP's paper, the Daily Worker. Contributors In 1945, Coulton Waugh employed a novel art approach on his PM strip Hank. According to Waugh, Hank was \\"a deliberate attempt to work in the field of social usefulness.\\" Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, published more than 400 cartoons on PM's editorial page. Crockett Johnson's comic strip Barnaby debuted in the paper in 1942. Other artists who worked at PM included Ad Reinhardt, one of the founders of Abstract Expressionism, and Joseph LeBoit, who both contributed margin cartoons and drawings. Noted artist Jack Coggins contributed wartime artwork for at least 9 issues between 1940 and 1942. Coulton Waugh created his short-lived strip, Hank, which began April 30, 1945 in PM. The story of a disabled G.I. returning to civilian life, Hank had a unique look due to Waugh's decorative art style, combined with dialogue lettered in upper and lower case rather than the accepted convention of all uppercase lettering in balloons and captions. Some dialogue was displayed with white lettering reversed into black balloons. Hank sought to raise questions about the reasons for war, and how it might be prevented by the next generation. Waugh discontinued it at the very end of 1945 because of eyestrain. Cartoonist Jack Sparling created the short-lived comic strip Claire Voyant, which ran from 1943 to 1948 in PM, and which was subsequently syndicated by the Chicago Sun- Times. Journalist I. F. Stone was the paper's Washington correspondent. He published an award-winning series on European Jewish refugees attempting to run the British blockade to reach Palestine, later collected and published as Underground to Palestine. Staffers included theater critic Louis Kronenberger and film critic Cecelia Ager. Weegee, Margaret Bourke-White, Ray Platnick and Arthur Leipzig were the photographers. The sports writers were Tom Meany, Tom O‚ÄôReilly and George F. T. Ryall, who covered horse racing. Sophie Smoliar was the New York City reporter working frequently with photographer Arthur Felig (Weegie) (submitted by her son and a collection of her original articles). Elizabeth Hawes wrote about fashion, and her sister Charlotte Adams covered food. Other writers who contributed articles included Erskine Caldwell, Myril Axlerod, McGeorge Bundy, Saul K.

He is the eldest son of former Major League Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens. Early life Born on December 4, 1986, in Houston, Texas, he was a two-sport star at Memorial High School, splitting time between football and baseball, before he suffered a back injury ending his brief football career. He hit .413 as a junior, with 4 home runs and 23 RBIs in 2004.www.TexasSports.com He had a .519 batting average and was named all- state in his senior year.

Minor leagues The Houston Astros picked Clemens in the 8th round of the amateur draft, 254th overall. The Astros organization had intended to use him as either a first or third baseman. He signed for a $380,000 bonus. In 2005, he played his first minor league baseball season, hitting .297 with 4 homers and 17 RBIs in 33 games for the Rookie League Greeneville Astros, and .281 with 6 RBIs in 9 games with the Class A Tri-City ValleyCats. He committed 15 errors in 32 games at third base. In 2006, he played with the Single-A Lexington Legends of the South Atlantic League, where he batted .229 with 5 home runs and 39 RBIs in 91 games. Clemens' sole appearance as a pitcher in professional baseball was for the Legends in 2006. On June 25, 2006, Clemens was in the news in a game against the Asheville Tourists. He was declared safe in a controversial play on second, leading the Tourists manager Joe Mikulik to go on a rampage. Through 2006, in the minors he batted .249 with 9 home runs, 63 RBIs, 7 stolen bases (while being caught once), and a .385 slugging percentage in 449 at bats. That season he hit a home run off his 43-year-old father, Roger Clemens, in a minor league exhibition game. In Koby's next at bat, Roger threw a brushback pitch at Koby in retaliation. They also played a game together in 2006,when the elder Clemens was making his comeback with the Astros and pitched a game for Lexington. In the 2006 Hawaiian Winter League, playing for North Shore Honu, Clemens batted .196 with 1 home run and 9 RBIs in 32 games. In 2007 he returned to the Single-A Lexington Legends, where he batted .252 with 15 home runs and 56 RBIs in 115 games. In 2008 he played with the Single-A Salem Avalanche in the Carolina League, batting .268. He converted to play as a catcher and played for the Corpus Christi Hooks in the Double-A Texas League. As of June 12, 2009, he returned to play with the Lancaster JetHawks in Advanced A in the California League in the roles of a catcher and designated hitter. In 2010, he again played for Corpus Christi, then played with the Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona Fall League. In 2011, Koby was with the Houston Astros' Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League, as their first baseman. Clemens started playing at the Puerto Rico Baseball League with the Mayag√ºez Indians as a first baseman in the fall of 2011. However, he abandoned the team abruptly on November 10, 2011. There were rumors his father, former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens, persuaded him to leave the island because of the kidnapping of Washington Nationals catcher, Wilson Ramos in Venezuela the day before. For abandoning the team with no reason given, Koby was banned from playing baseball in the Caribbean Baseball Confederation. On February 9, 2012, Clemens signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. During the 2012 season, he played for the Blue Jays' Double-A affiliate, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats of the Eastern League, and their high Single-A team, the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League as a catcher, first baseman, third baseman, outfielder, and designated hitter. He was released at the end of the season. Koby played in the California Winter League in Palm Springs, California from January 18 to February 16, 2013. From 2012-2014 he played for the Sugar Land Skeeters, including a game when he caught pitches thrown by his father. On February 13, 2015, Clemens was hired as a minor league spring instructor for the Astros farm system. Astros Director of Player Development Quentin McCracken said the Astros \\"expect by the end of the year or by next season he will be on staff fully.\\" He now owns his own baseball company called Koby Clemens Baseball Clinics and teaches individual and private lessons.

As early as the year 1918, some of the most influential and prominent citizens of the then barrio of Basista came together and made the first attempt to petition the municipal government and the provincial board of San Carlos and Pangasinan respectively to grant the township of their barrios. Prominent politicians during that time volunteered their help in making representations with the proper authorities, but their request was not granted. Some of those leaders were: General Mamaril, Don Valeriano Perez, father of then speaker Eugenio P√©rez, Buenaventura de Vera, Telesforo de Vera, Gregorio Malicdem, Cayetano Perez, Gaudencio Padua, Gregorio Valdez, Ramon Valdez, Don Roque de Vera, Domingo Resultay, Bernardo Resultay, Liberato Frias, Hipolito Cayabyab, Alejandro de guzman , Pascual Resultay, Raymundo de Guzman, Vicente de Guzman, Domingo de Guzman, Vicente Frias, Florentino Malicdem, Faustino Monzon, Cornelio de Guzman, Felix de Guzman, Juan Malicdem, Federico Cancino, Artemio Frias, Claudio de Guzman and several others. On September 5, 1961, President Carlos P. Garcia issued Executive Order No. 446 creating the town of Basista composed of 13 barrios out of the 28 that petitioned. Four years after, however, the Philippine Supreme Court declared the town's creation as without legal basis citing their ruling in the \\"Emmanuel Pelaez vs. Auditor General\\" that \\"municipalities created under Executive Orders are void\\". It was here that Republic Act No. 4866 filed by Congressman Jack L. Soriano was enacted into law and legally created Basista as a town of Pangasinan.

A historian, Rosario Cortez, however, wrote that Bautista existed since 1686, but was removed to the Parish of Bayambang. The \\"Rebirth of Bautista\\" as municipality was only in 1900. Don Ramon Reynado became the first town executive along with other notable founder: Guillermo Agcaoile, Francisco Gonzales, Felipe Ramos, Dionisio Galvan, Teodoro Carungay, Claudio and Antonio Galsim, Marciano Guzman, Nicolas Galsim, Marcelino Villanueva and Eleno Cayabyab. Bautista was dubbed \\"mercancia\\" or \\"Melting Pot\\" (where cargoes due to Camiling, Tarlac were traded via the Agno River or by train). The municipality was truly a melting pot, indicative of which is the diversity of people's dialects and languages. The residents of the town were Pangasinenses, Ilocanos, Tagalogs, Pampangos, Chinese and Spanish. The people of Nibaliw, Baluyot and Cabuaan are mostly Pangasinenses. The people of Nandacan, Villanueva, Poponto, Primicias, Artacho and Pogo are predominantly Ilocanos. Within the Poblacion, one would be able to meet a number of people with different persuasions, ideals and expression in varied dialects and language. Bautista natives' livelihoods are farming, broom making (fiber, tanobong and midribs), dressmaking, sawali making, buro making, building construction, auto mechanics, basketry, bag making, blacksmithing, pottery, ceramics and hollow blocks making and rattan crafts. The residents also have clay, cattle, poultry, bamboo, rattan, anahaw, abiang, fishes, sugar, basi, vinegar and coconut, including watermelon and onion, its principal product. 1907 to 1920 was its golden years until San Quintin-Paniqui rail road line was opened, thus Bautista lost to Rosales, Tayug and San Quintin.

The municipality maintains close relations with San Carlos City and Malasiqui, with whom it would partition the impoverished municipality of Basista if the said town would choose partition instead of reunification with San Carlos City.

The verdant hills of Bayambang were almost covered by these plants. The people made pickles out of them. As years passed by, these plants became extinct in the vicinity, but the name \\"Bayambang\\" which sounds like an echo of the plant's name, was retained and was given to designate this town.

Life He moved to Soho Square, London from Winston, County Durham when about twenty years of age, and was employed by John Cary, the engraver and William Faden. He became Hydrographer to the Prince of Wales and subsequently to the King in 1820. In January 1790 he made himself famous by his large chart of the world on Mercator projection. Four years later he published another large map of the world on the globular projection, with a companion volume of explanation. The maps of North America (1796) and Scotland (1807) are the most celebrated of his many later productions. In 1804 63 maps drawn by Arrowsmith and Samuel Lewis of Philadelphia (publisher of William Clark's manuscript map of the Northwest) were published in the New and elegant General Atlas Comprising all Discoveries to the Present Time. Later editions of the atlas were published in 1805, 1812, and 1819. The 1804 and 1812 editions are digitized in the David Rumsey map collection. He left two sons, Aaron and Samuel, the elder of whom was the compiler of the Eton Comparative Atlas, of a Biblical atlas, and of various manuals of geography. Aaron Arrowsmith the elder was responsible for organising the volume of maps for Rees's Cyclop√¶dia, 1802‚Äì19. The business was thus carried on in company with John Arrowsmith (1790‚Äì1873), nephew of the elder Aaron.

From 1980, she worked as a high school teacher in Norseman, Kambalda, Northam and Morawa. Later she moved into education management before starting her own consulting company. She married in 1984, but the marriage lasted only two years. Political career Ravlich was elected to the Legislative Council in 1996, becoming the first woman born in a non-English speaking country to enter the Parliament of Western Australia. She is also thought to be the first Croatian- born woman elected to a parliament outside Croatia. When the Gallop Labor government was elected in 2001, she served as a parliamentary secretary until 2005, when she was appointed as Local Government Minister. Shortly afterwards she became the Minister for Education. Charged with the implementation of a controversial outcomes-based education policy, she held a high-profile portfolio and received much media coverage before losing her ministerial position in December 2006. PLATO WA, a community-based lobby group, celebrated her demotion. In March 2007, as a result of a cabinet reshuffle by Premier Alan Carpenter, Ravlich was reinstated into the cabinet. She lives in Cottesloe, and is the partner of Western Australia's former State Opposition Leader Eric Ripper.

Rehearsal letters are most often used in scores of the Romantic era and onwards, beginning with Louis Spohr. Rehearsal letters are typically placed at structural points in the piece. Terminology They may also be generically called rehearsal marks or rehearsal figures,Del Mar or, when numbers are used instead of letters, rehearsal numbers.  Purpose  In the course of rehearsing a symphony or piece, it is often necessary for the conductor to stop and go back to some point in the middle, in order to master the more difficult passages or sections, or to resolve a challenge that the ensemble is having. Many scores and parts have bar numbers, every five or ten bars, or at the beginning of each page or line. But as pieces and individual movements of works became longer (extending to several hundred bars) as the Romantic era progressed, bar numbers became less practical in rehearsal. From a page in the full score of Christoph Graupner's Symphony in D major, Nagel 75. If the conductor wants to resume rehearsal from the second measure shown here, he could either say \\"measure 21\\" or \\"letter A\\". For example, a conductor can tell their musicians to resume at bar 387, so that the musicians have to find the nearest bar number in their parts (e.g. 385 or 390) and count back or forward a couple of measures. Even if the number 387 is written at the appropriate bar, it might not particularly stand out. But if there is, for example, a big, bold letter M in the score and parts, it is much easier for the conductor to just say \\"begin at letter M\\". Even if the conductor were to say \\"one bar before letter M\\", that would still be more convenient than saying \\"bar 386\\". Alternatively the conductor could first say \\"before M...\\" and allow the players time to find M and then say \\"one bar\\".J. V. Horn The Community Orchestra Greenwood Press, 1979 p. 53 In the score of a full orchestra, rehearsal letters are typically placed over the flutes' (or piccolo's) staff, and duplicated above the first violins' staff. For concert bands, rehearsal letters are placed over the piccolo's staff (or flutes'), and over the trumpets'.Matthew Nicholl & Richard Grudzinski, Music Notation: Preparing Scores and Parts, ed. Jonathan Feist. Boston: Berklee Press (2007): 46. \\"Rehearsal marks appear above the top staff in most scores. In large scores, rehearsal marks can also appear in a second place, usually in the middle of the system or above each choir.\\" Rehearsal letters should appear in every part, but the conductor or librarian should check this and also make sure that they agree with the conductor's score; if they do not, the letters from the parts should be copied to the conductor's score.Horn, 1979, ibid. For typical pieces or movements of the Romantic era marked allegro, the letters A to Z can be used up, though the letters I, J or O (or all) may be skipped. Placement and frequency of the letters do not follow a hard-and-fast rule. Generally they are inserted at places where there is a musically significant change, for example a new theme, or a change in dynamic or instrumentation or the start of a new section ‚Äì just those places where a conductor might want to restart in rehearsal. In addition, having the letters coincide with musical signposts can help players who are counting rests confirm they are still in the right place, which would not be possible if the marks were placed at numerically regular intervals. The letter A is almost always used for a point close to the beginning, but not for the very beginning itself because it is much easier to say \\"from the beginning\\". Likewise, rehearsal letters are not necessary at changes in tempo, key signature or time signature, as the name of the new tempo or signature can serve the same purpose. For example, in some editions of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, letter A of the Finale does not occur until bar 140, when the relatively late entry of the first violins with the \\"Ode to Joy\\" theme might not stand out enough to the other players to be a convenient point of reference, whereas the reminiscences of the previous movements' themes are more easily referenced by their tempo markings. From the bassoon part of Christoph Graupner's Symphony in D major, Nagel 75. If the conductor says to resume playing from measure 21, the bassoonist has to count from measure 18, or count backwards from measure 23. But if the conductor says to resume from letter A, the bassoonist needs only find the letter A in his or her part. A rehearsal letter usually breaks a multimeasure rest in a part (except in cases where a given instrument does not play at all in a given movement of the work). Because rehearsal letters are sometimes independent of edition and in some cases even version, they are also useful for telling applicants for positions in the orchestra what passages they need to play at the audition. They are also useful for easy reference in scholarly essays about orchestral works. However, rehearsal letters are altogether absent from some editions of some pieces that have them in other editions, such as the older editions of Richard Wagner's Meistersinger prelude.Del Mar Rehearsal letters are less useful in unaccompanied instrumental music such as the solo piano repertoire (although they may be used in duets), since the instrumentalist has no need to communicate to a fellow player where to resume playing. Songs also tend not to use them, because it is more useful to refer to the lyrics (except in pieces where the lyrics are highly repetitive, or those with long lyric-less sections).  Usage in the late 19th century to 21st century  In some cases, A to Z might not be enough. After Z, Aa may be used, followed by Bb, and so on until Zz (though Ii, Jj and/or Oo might also be skipped). The Wilhelm Hansen edition of Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 7 in C major presents one unusual case: the letters A to Z (including both I and J, as well as O) are used up with just three more pages left in the score. For the final flute and bassoon solo, the editors use √ñ (the final letter of the Finnish alphabet) as a rehearsal letter.But in the case of some composers, such as Gustav Mahler and Dmitri Shostakovich, twice through the alphabet might still not be enough. For this reason, some editors prefer rehearsal numbers to rehearsal letters. Mahler's and Shostakovich's scores use rehearsal numbers rather than letters. These are typically in boldface and enclosed in a box, or less commonly, a circle. Confusingly, however, some editions enclose bar numbers in boxes, though usually not in bold. In the Schirmer edition of Roy Harris's Symphony No. 3 (in one movement), the rehearsal numbers are enclosed in circles, and they occur every ten measures, actually being the bar number divided by 10. That rehearsal numbers \\"are easily confused with measure numbers\\" is a reason sometimes given in favor of rehearsal letters.Kurt Stone. Music Notation in the Twentieth Century: A Practical Guidebook (New York & London, W. W. Norton & Company, 1980), p. 168 Advocates of rehearsal numbers counter that even 26 letters are not enough for some scores. Whereas rehearsal letters reset to A for each movement of a multi-movement work (even for connected movements), rehearsal numbers typically run over the course of the entire work, even if the movements are not connected. For example, the rehearsal number for the last few bars of the first movement of Edward Elgar's First Symphony is 55; the first rehearsal number of the second movement is 56. There are exceptions, however. The final outburst in the first movement of Mahler's Second Symphony is rehearsal number 27. Mahler actually wanted a pause of five minutes before the next movement, so the rehearsal numbers reset to 1, ending with 15. The third movement follows after a short break, but its first rehearsal number is 28.Mahler, Gustav. Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2 in Full Score, Dover, (1987) pp. 224-225, 248. =Jazz and pop= For jazz and pop compositions with several choruses, \\"many jazz composers and arrangers\\" use a format in which \\"each successive verse/chorus part of the form is assigned successive letters of the alphabet\\" combined with a measure number: for example, letter A for the first 8-bar phrase of the verse after the introduction, A9 for the next 8-bar phrase, A17, A25, then B, B9, B17, B25 for the chorus, etc., with the special rehearsal marking TAG for the tag ending.Nicholl & Grudzinski (2007): 45 In jazz and pop music, the musicians frequently refer to the \\"A section\\" or the \\"B section\\" of a 32 bar song during rehearsals. In pop music, the music is commonly organized into standard sections, such as an intro, multiple verses and choruses (refrain), one or more bridges, a guitar solo (or other instrumental solos), and an outros. As such, a bandleader who wishes to start in the middle of a song will typically specify which part of this structure the band should start on (e.g., \\"last four bars of the bridge, going into the guitar solo\\" or \\"last verse and go to the outro\\").

A theory also points out that once upon a time \\"pamulinawen\\" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore. Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odoric of Pordenone who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain. According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte. The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609. This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849. Bolinao is also the home town of Emerita Romero, who now resides in Canada. = First Mass = On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the belief that the first Mass in the Philippines was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.Inquirer.net, Bolinao stakes claim to Mass held in 1324 = Hard coal spill = Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon \\"Mina\\" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.Inquirer.net, Bolinao to sue barge owners for coal spill = Bolinao Skull = The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila. = World War II = The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces.

Demographics  = Language = The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language. The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists. The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

History The municipality of Bugallon was formerly called \\"Salasa\\" (meaning floor joist in the dialect, a part of a wooden house where the floor is attached to). In the Spanish colonial era, the Spanish authorities established the town center in Poblacion (now Barangay Salasa). Because of the 1914 massive flooding and erosion, the town center was later transferred to Barrio Anagao (became Barangay Poblacion) but the Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, one of the oldest churches in the country, could not be transferred (every time someone attempts, he dies). A new Catholic church was created in the Poblacion, the Saint Andrew Catholic Church. This is the reason why Bugallon has two Catholic Churches (one in Salasa and the other in Anagao). Fr. Antonio Perez. founded Salasa (1714-1747) In 1720, Poblacion was in Barangay Polong's Don Francisco Valencerina yard, later transferred later to Baranggay Salasa on January 24, 1734 by Fr. Fernando Garcia. The Plaza, Presedencia, the church and convent, were engineered by the Frayle (surrounded by parallel calles). Do√±a Milagros Klar, wife of then manager of Pantranco (Philtranco) donated in 1935, the Our Lady of Lourdes statue to Salasa Shrine. The town was named after the town's hero Major Jose Torres Bugallon who fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War in 1899. February 5, 1899, at the Battle of La Loma, Bugallon faced Gen. Arthur MacArthur. Bugallon suffered a shot to the thigh during the battle. Later that day, in the arms of Antonio Luna, Bugallon died from excessive loss of blood. In 1921, the town of Salasa was renamed to Bugallon. Mr. Canullas founded the Jose Torres Bugallonas association and a monument was erected in the plaza, wherein the bones of General Bugallon were interred thereat on January 12, 1958. The act of changing Salasa an old town to a new one, Bugallon, required a congressional approval sponsored by the Congressman Mauro Navarro, first district of Pangasinan, and obtained congressional approval in changing Salasa to Bugallon. Hence, Salasa became a mere barangay but remains the seat of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish (11 barangays) and the other is Bugallon's St. Andrew the Apostle (14 barangay).

The church has impressive inspired-baroque type of altar for the saints. Its Feast Day is November 30 with Parish Priest, Fr. Dominador Mendoza, Jr., Population of 57,445. It is part of the Vicariate of Our Lady of Lourdes, under Vicar Forane, Father Raymond R. Oligane St. Andrew the Apostle Parish was originally erected at Salasa (founded by the Dominicans in the 18th century). When the town site was transferred, the seat of the parish was also transferred as a consequence brought about by natural calamities that battered the area. The 1914 Salasa floods destroyed crops, properties, buildings, the church and convent. Poblacion was transferred to Barangay Anagao (Bugallon), under Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Andrew the Apostle remained the patron Saint in July 1920 with 1st Parish Priest, Fr. Eustaquio Ocampo, then, Fr. Montano Domingo on November 29, 1921 and on June 1928, Fr Emeterio Domagas succeeded. On May 23, 1929, Pangasinan was created as a new Diocese and Msgr. Cesar Maria Guerrero became Pangasinan's First Bishop onn May 23, 1929. In 1930, Franciscan Capuchin appointed Fr. Cesario of Legario and Fr. Fernando of Erasum to Bugallon and Salasa, respectively on September 17, 1930. The Salasa Church, one of the biggest in Philippines, 100 meters long was completely destroyed and despoiled by Bugallon natives. Fr.

According to the , it has a population of people. On the western part of Pangasinan, along the coast of the China Sea lies a town called - Burgos, perched on a broad plateau. Burgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from Paoay, Ilocos Norte headed by Don Matias Guiang. As the settlement grew thickly populated and extensive, Don Matias Guiang led a petition to the Governor of Zambales to create a new town out of the settlement. The request was granted and the new town was named San Isidro which was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan by virtue of Public Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. Etymology Burgos was originally named San Isidro in honor of its patron saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents added \\"Potot \\" to the town's name. This term is an Ilocano adjective meaning \\"clipped\\", \\"cut-off\\" or \\"disconnected\\", referring to the Amburayan River which during dry season doesn't have continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months. Confusion however continued and persisted as mail for San Isidro de Potot was erroneously sent to the town of San Isidro Labrador and those of the latter to the former town. To resolve the confusion, Mayor Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's name to Burgos in 1913, in memory of Filipino martyr Padre Jos√© Apolonio Burgos, who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Geography Burgos is in the western part of Pangasinan situated on a broad plateau at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges. It is west of Mabini, south of Agno, north of Dasol, and east of the South China Sea; about from the capital town of Lingayen. It also holds the westernmost point in Luzon. =Barangays= Burgos is politically subdivided into 14 barangays. * Anapao (Bur Anapac) * Cacayasen * Concordia * Ilio-ilio (Iliw-iliw) * Papallasen *Poblacion * Pogoruac * Don Matias * San Miguel * San Pascual * San Vicente * Sapa Grande * Sapa Peque√±a * Tambacan =Climate= History =Spanish period= In the first part of the 19th century, Mat√≠as Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of Paoay, Ilocos Norte, regularly traveled the China Sea between the Ilocos and Zambales regions for the purpose of trade. Attracted to its agricultural possibilities, Mat√≠as Guiang along with his family, friends and neighbors eventually migrated to Zambales del Norte, now the westernmost part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it. They found a settlement in the eastern part of the present town proper. The provincial government of Zambales has not ignored the ever increasing population of San Isidro and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Mat√≠as Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of Iba, Zambales issued a decree creating the settlement into a pueblo and appointed Don Mat√≠as Guiang, who was then the most wealthy and influential land owner of the place, as the first gobernadorcillo of the town. San Isidro de Potot was its incorporated name in honor of Saint Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers had adopted, loved and revered as their patron saint. =Philippine Revolution= In the late 19th century, the gobernadorcillo was Don Tom√°s Braga, and the parish priest of the town during the revolution was Mariano Torrente, a native of Barcelona, Spain. The town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching, but the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturbed the people. Twenty Spanish cazadores had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \\"hunters\\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents. Across the plaza from the cuartel was a big convent, made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide, and two stories high. Across the plaza from the convent was the tribunal or municipal hall, This tribunal was made out of stones, ten meters high. A tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick. As insurgency was becoming widespread; the Spaniards adopted measures that increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales (now Western Pangasinan), the leader of the insurgency was Roman Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, while in San Isidro, the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents, while numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos. In February 1898, the outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Spanish forces in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Spaniards, who managed to escape to the big convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them, but the Spaniards were able to escape again, now they entrenched themselves deeply to the tower at the middle of the plaza. The people of the town including the gobernadorcillo and the principales gone to distant the place. After a siege of two nights and three days, the Spanish forces threw their guns out of the windows of the tower as surrender, mediated by Fr. Mariano Torrente. The morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop, heavily armed had arrived in Alaminos and were on their way to San Isidro, to save the Spaniards. To prevent the escape, they were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now Mabini), where in the forest, Alimpayukan, the Spanish cazadores and civiles and including Fr. Torrente and also Fr. Navas of Dasol were blindfolded and their heads cut-off. Shortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that were owned by the richest and the most influential people of the town. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Fr. Juan Navas, was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan and many of the insurgents were from Dasol, the big Spanish troop proceeded to Dasol, where they killed the principales and captains, that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. On March 7, 1898, the small Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales were defeated and around fifty Spanish friars were killed. These were the parish priests of Anda, Balincaguin, Bani, Bolinao, Dasol and San Isidro de Potot. When the Spanish troop had left, the insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government. =American Occupation= The Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortiz came to recruit volunteers to fight the Americans in Mangatarem. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavily armed Americans. They went back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro. The Americans occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order through a policy of attraction. They gave clothes, free goods and tolerated the local customs. American styles of dress influenced the changing of Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental. In 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro, destroying the big convent and the municipal building. In 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were Alaminos, Bolinao, Anda, Bani, Agno, Infanta and San Isidro de Potot. The municipality of San Isidro at that time included Balincaguin and Dasol. Shortly after the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated to Pangasinan. Balincaguin (1908) and Dasol (1911) seceded from San Isidro de Potot. Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of Apolinario Mabini), and San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Jos√© Burgos) in 1913. =World War II= During the Japanese Occupation in the years 1941-1945, the Japanese soldiers did not much disturbed the barrios of the town, due to Japanese high command to give compulsory contribution of rice and bamboos for their garrison.

The name Calasiao was derived from the native word Kalasian, which means \\"a place where lightning frequently occurs\\", from the root word lasi, meaning \\"lightning\\". Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, they called the place \\"Lugar de Rayos\\", a literal Spanish translation of the word Kalasian. It was named as such because it is said that Calasiao back in the day was always frequented by this natural phenomenon. Today, Calasiao is known as a First Class Municipality and is located at the very heart of Pangasinan. It governs 24 barangays and 31 sitios in a total land area of 4,836 hectares. Calasiao's flagship product is the native rice cake known as Puto Calasiao.

Calasiao was settled by a Pangasinan speaking people whose language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages family. In 1571, the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan began. The Spanish conquistadors were accompanied by Roman Catholic missionaries who introduced Roman Catholicism to the indigenous peoples of Pangasinan. In the 16th century, Dominican friars, who were settling at Gabon, were driven out because of the continuing unrest in the town. The formation of the new Calasiao however was not immediately welcomed by its native inhabitants. Hence in 1660, when the call for the Malong Rebellion came, the citizens picked up their weapons and joined in the fight against the Spanish rule. The citizens were also one of the first people to answer the call for rebellion of Juan de la Cruz Palaris of Binalatongan (now San Carlos City), which succeeded in driving the Spanish rulers and friars out of the boundaries. The town of Calasiao became part of the Pangasinan encomendia of Labaya, designated as belonging to the King of Spain, Juan Ximenez del Pino, and a son of Alonso Hernandez de Sandoval for whom tributes were collected. Today, Calasiao is rapidly expanding town. It may soon become a city or join with Dagupan City and San Carlos City to be a metropolis. Yet many people from Calasiao have emigrated to other parts of the Philippines, the United States and other countries to seek better opportunities. Local government The town hall is located in front of the Roman Catholic convent of San Pedro y San Pablo de Calasiao, the same building as the shrine of Senor Divino Tesoro.

Like other towns in the Philippines, Calasiao is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios. =Elected officials= The town is led by Mayor Joseph Arman Bauzon, Vice Ferdinand Galang, and 10 other councilors.

It is also the birthplace of former President Fidel V. Ramos. History The Augustinian missionaries and the Spanish conquistadores drew a plan of Lingayen in 1614 and Lingayen was founded. The founders named the town Lingayen at the suggestion of natives themselves, due to a certain corpulent tamarind tree growing on the present town plaza at that time. The tree was exceptionally big, tall, and spreading; that the surrounding trees were just drafts in comparison. Passers-by developed the habit of looking back and back again at this corpulent tree until it would vanish from their rear view. When they arrived home and were asked what way they took in returning they would simply say \\"through Li√±gayen\\". The word \\"Li√±gayen\\" was from the Pangasinan language word \\"lingawen\\" meaning \\" to look back\\". Since then up to the present time the town bears its name as Lingayen. Lingayen became the capital of Pangasinan when the province became an encomienda. During World War II, Lingayen was where the Allied armies landed during the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf.

Of note are the municipality's Provincial Capitol, Urduja House, Colegio del Santissimo Rosario Ruins, and the two Gabaldon structures inside Pangasinan National High School. Pangasinan Provincial Capitol Building is a neoclassical building designed by Ralph Harrington Doane. It was damaged during World War II and was reconstructed in 1946 with assistance from the US government under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act. With the completion of its repair and rehabilitation in 2008, the building earned the title \\"Best Provincial Capitol in the Philippines\\". Urduja House, also called the Princess Urduja Palace, is named after the legendary warrior Princess Urduja. It currently serves as the governor's official residence and guest house. Colegio del Santissimo Rosario Ruins was constructed in 1890 as an exclusive school for girls run by the Dominican sisters. Its lumber, windows, tin roofs, and beams were used to build another school in San Manuel town, leaving the structure in ruins. At present, it is within the compound of a private property. Pangasinan National High School, erstwhile known as Pangasinan Academic High School, was the first public secondary school in Pangasinan. In 1946, the North and South Gabaldon buildings were constructed within the school campus. And now it is considered as the mother school in entire Pangasinan. Thousands of students are enrolled in this school. And due to the K-12 Program it also offer courses for Senior High School students. The school has several buildings for the Senior High School. Malong Building is named after a Pangasinense hero named Andres Malong who led the revolt against the Spaniards from 1660 to 1661. Construction of the building started in 1956 and completed in 1958. It got a major renovation in 2008, the same year the Pangasinan Provincial Capitol Building had undergone a facelift. Palaris Building, formerly known as Kalantiaw Building, was named after Datu Kalantiaw, said to have composed the first legal code of the Philippines, the Code of Kalantiaw. The code was said to be fraudulent and Kalantiyaw was not a Pangasinense but an Aklanon, according to some historical accounts. The building was renamed Palaris, in honor of the heroic acts of Pantaleon Perez, also known as \\"Palaris\\" in leading the Pangasinense rebels from 1762‚Äì1764 against the Spaniards. Sison Auditorium was built in Neo- classical Style, and was constructed in 1927. It was initially known as the ‚ÄúGrand Provincial Auditorium‚Äù in the 1930s was the popular venue for zarzuelas and other cultural performances in pre-war and early post-war period. It was later renamed after former Governor Teofilo Sison, the first Pangasinense to become secretary of National Defense. In 2010, it had undergone a major renovation and inaugurated in the same year, April 5. At present, Sison Auditorium serves as the Cultural Center of Ilocos Region.

The municipality was formerly called Balincaguin.Santo Nino Parish History, Mabini Parish, retrieved 2012 Barangays Mabini is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. History Mabini Public Market The municipality of Mabini used to be a part of the Province of Zambales and was surrounded by mountains, forests, and valleys. It was originally called \\"Balincaguin\\" that was derived from the Zambal phrase \\"Bali Lan Caguin\\" which means \\"adobe of bats\\". This name referred to the nocturnal mammals (bats) that inhabited the caves found in the hills and mountains between the municipality and Zambales in the west and Tarlac to the south-west. The place may have been founded in 1610 by Spanish missionaries who were Augustinian Recollects, although this is uncertain. In 1800, Balincaquin became a town under Don Isidro Puzon who is believed to be the founder. Some of its population (770 families) were Ilocanos who moved to the municipality due to its agricultural health. The site where these settlers situated near the mountains used to be called \\"Conventa.\\" Good quality rice was then consistently produced and marketed to Manila and even to China. Other products such as corn, sugar cane, cotton and so forth were also demanded and consequently, distributed widely through numerous markets. Apart from agriculture, the industry of saddle-making, knapsack-making and hat-weaving existed. The residents also engaged in tending cattle, carabaos, horses and goats. At the same time, gradual increase of the number of bats compelled the residents to catch them. These mammals were suspected of flying through the nearby forests because of the catching that lasted until 1930. In 1930, the town's name was changed to Mabini in honor of Apolinario Mabini, who was considered as \\"The Great Sublime Paralytic\\" and \\"Brains of the Revolution.\\" The municipality was merged with Alaminos, Bani, Anda, Dasol, Burgos, Bolinao and Infanta in 1904 and presently comprises the province's first district.

The series of uprisings that have been called the 'Saya San rebellion' has been regarded as one of Southeast Asia's quintessential anti-colonial movements. Because of its national and historical nature, discussions about Saya San and the rebellion associated with him has persisted to this day, particularly within academic spheres. Saya San‚Äôs life Saya San was a native of Shwebo, a centre of nationalist- monarchist sentiment in north-central Burma that was the birthplace of the Konbaung (or Alaungpaya) dynasty, which controlled Myanmar from 1752 until the British annexation in 1886. He was born on 24 October 1876. His original name was Yar Kyaw. His parents were U Kyaye and Daw Hpet, who lived with their five children in the rural agricultural village of Thayetkan. Yar Kyaw was exposed to Buddhist tenets at an early age by studying at the local village monastery. Then he continued his studies at the nearby Hpo Hmu monastery until he was nearly twenty years old. Yar Kyaw left for the village of Nga Kaung Inn soon after with a hope that he could make a better living selling mats and baskets as an alternative to working in the agricultural sector. Eventually, he met and married Ma Kay, and had two children, Ko Po Thin and Ma Sein. As economic condition failed to improve, Yar Kyaw left for Moulmein in Lower Burma, where employment opportunities were better because of the expansion of the rice frontier. Earning his living as a carpenter for some time and then more successfully as a fortuneteller and traditional healer, he wrote two treatises on traditional healing practices that questioned the authority and efficacy of Western medical treatment. The transition Saya San made from a medical man to a political activist is not very clear. People tend to believe that he joined the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) led by U Soe Thein in 1920s. He began his political career as a representative of his village and soon progressed to lead his township and district branch of Moulmein. In 1924, at the annual congress of the GCBA, 45-year-old Saya San was elected to chair a commission to survey the living conditions of the Burmese peasantry. In late December 1930, Saya San organized peasant revolt and proclaimed himself a pretender to the throne who, like Alaungpaya, would unite the people and expel the British invader. He organized his followers into the ‚ÄúGalon Army‚Äù and he was proclaimed ‚Äúking‚Äù at Insein, near Rangoon (Yangon). Quickly, the rebellion drew colonial authority's attention and was suppressed by British army. As the revolt collapsed, Saya San fled to the Shan Plateau in the east. By August 1931, however, he was captured at Hokho and brought back to Tharrawaddy. He was tried and sentenced by a Special Rebellion Tribunal. Despite the efforts of his lawyer, Ba Maw, he was executed on November 28, 1931. Saya San Rebellion =Arrival of the British= Briefly, the imperial history of Burma had sustained almost eight centuries. In the 9th century the Tibeto- Burman speaking Burmese, began migrating to the Irrawaddy valley from present- day Yunnan's Nanzhao kingdom and then established the Pagan Kingdom in 1057. Pagan's power slowly waned in the 13th century. Kublai Khan's Mongol forces invaded northern Burma and sacked Pagan city itself, the kingdom fall in 1287. In the second half of the 16th century, the Taungoo Dynasty reunified the country, and founded the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a brief period. In the 18th century, the Konbaung Dynasty restored the kingdom, and went to war with all its neighbors. The kingdom fought three wars with the British. In 1885, the kingdom was conquered, and the King Thebaw, was deported to India. Eventually, Burma was annexed into British rule in 1886, but the more difficult task of maintaining stability remained, as British authorities immediately faced a number of uprisings that erupted throughout the formal Burmese Kingdom. By the 1890s, colonial officials had determined that the main pacification campaigns were successful, and they could concentrate on the business of building a social-economic infrastructure that could support their interest in the vast teak, mineral, and agricultural resources that their new colony provided. Attached as a province of India, British Burma would be subject to administrative policies established in New Delhi as well as the vast array of procedural structures that characterized the India Civil Service. The new territories were divided into districts and assigned a commissioner with a small support staff. Through the prism and experience of British India, Burmese people, cultures, languages and histories were constructed by imperial surveys that now sought to map the new territories. Indigenous healing practices, rituals, folktales, notions of authority and village life would be organized and categorized according to how well the district officer understood what he was observing. Moreover, when the British Indian authorities destroyed the kingdom of Burma in 1885-1886, they transferred the Burmese royal throne to a museum in Calcutta. Meanwhile, the Palace of Mandalay was converted into the British Upper Burma Club, disregarding its immense cosmological importance to the Burmese. In other words, the colonial rule had changed the social landscape of ancient Burma in a manner that caused much resentment. =Resistance movements before Saya San= The British had faced numerous outbreaks of resistance throughout 1886-1890. These opposition movements became more intensive and extensive. Some of these rebellions were led by former members of the court, like the Myinzaing Prince, who continued to wield considerable influence over troops and villagers in provincial centers that had once been in alliance with the throne. Other pockets of resistance were led by local headmen and monks but were limited by size and scope. These were often short-lived either due to lack of support or the overwhelming technical advantage of the British. In the late 1890s, a small group of Buddhist associations with contemporary forms of organization and structure were founded by lay members in an effort to preserve the religion and its place in society. In 1906, political organizations such as the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) came into prominence within Rangoon, drawing young clerks and educated elites into working for changes in colonial society through accepted and approved channels. The YMBA focused on improving social conditions and concentrating on educational government on issue of cultural identity. This would pave the way for formation of the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) which planned to participate more directly in political protest and demonstrations. In order to engage rural communities, members of GCBA would travel into the countryside conducting interviews, collecting data, and filling reports to establish lines of communication with emerging village activists. Saya San joined the GCBA and worked in the countryside for more than two years, so he was familiar with rural places and had direct connections with peasants. =What happened during the Rebellion?= In October 1930, there had been earthquakes at Pegu and Pyu. These were heralded as portents, recalling prophesies that the throne of the King of Burma would not remain unoccupied. At the auspicious moment, the coronation of Saya San proceeded in the traditional manner, at a pagoda near Rangoon. Saya San was proclaimed the Thupannaka Galon Raja, and donned the royal raiments prescribed by ancient usage. On 21 December 1930, the Galon Raja moved to his palace on Alaungtang Hill in Tharrawaddy, where a royal city, known as Buddharaja Myo, or ‚ÄúBuddhist King‚Äôs Town‚Äù, was ceremonially plotted out. The new king disposed of the proper retinue of five queens, four ministers, and four regiments. Saya San promised supporters that he would restore the authority of the Burmese monarchy, revitalize the Buddhist religion and expel the British. Also, he assured his oath-bound followers that they would be protected by his magical charms and tattoos. On the night of 22 December the first outbreak occurred in the Tharrawaddy district. Tharrawaddy, like most of Lower Burma, suffered severe economic dislocation during the ‚ÄòHoover Slump‚Äô. The Great Depression of 1930 had a devastating impact on rice prices. Rice was Burma's most important export commodity and its fortunes on commercial markets affected much of the rural population. The high population density in central Burma and the concentration of land ownership in fewer hands created a large number of disaffected landless laborers increasingly aggrieved with colonial government, whom they lamed both their inability to work the land independently and for decline of their real incomes as rice worker. Thus, rural cultivators, already frustrated by the drop of the price of rice were quick to respond to Saya San's appeals involving a mixture of anti-tax rhetoric, Buddhist prophecies and guarantees of invulnerability. In a few weeks it became clear that the violence that began in Tharrawaddy had escalated. The British authority, officials in New Delhi were soon asked by their Rangoon counterparts to dispatch armed forces to quell the rebellion. However, the military support did not produce immediate results. The outbreaks continued to spread in neighboring districts. The rebellion spread to the districts of Pyapon, Henzada, Insein, Pegu, Toungoo, Prome, Thayetmyo, Naungcho Township, and the Northern Shan States. Other rebellion leaders such as U Aung Hla, Bo Aung Shwe, and Bo Aung Pe led uprisings in neighboring districts to secure weapons, raid police stations, and attack government representatives. Within weeks of the first outbreak, Rangoon authorities responded by seeking special emergency power from India. By June 1931, a Special Rebellion Commissioner, Mr. Booth Gravely, was appointed to manage affairs in Burma. In July 1931, the authorities considered the situation so serious that they (unsuccessfully) asked permission from the government of India to introduce martial law. By August 1931, Saya San was captured. By then, the rebellion had gone on for nearly two years. The revolt was crushed, and the casualties were not much certain. By the end of 1932, more than 1000 rebels were killed and a further 9000 rebels were surrendered or captured. Saya San and 125 other rebels were hanged and almost 1400 were sentenced to terms of imprisonment or of transportation. Who is the \\"Galon\\" King? Saya San took the name of the Thupannaka Galon Raja. This name could be understood in three dimensions within the Burmese context. The Galon, is a well-recognized figure in the literature of Hindu-Buddhist Southeast Asia. Galon was a fabulous bird of Hindu mythology. It is often depicted in combat with the NƒÅga. This cosmic battle between galon and nƒÅga would come to represent ideas about the power of nature, the dualities of the world, and the challenges of the human conditions. First, after British rule has arrived, the NƒÅga was generally recognized as the symbol for the British, while the Galon stood for Burma. Thus in one sense, the Galon was a triumphant symbol of resistance or anti- British sentiment, as the Galon is the vanquisher of the NƒÅga. Secondly, The Galon-NƒÅga symbolism also had other meanings. In Eastern mythology, the Galon represents the sun-force or solar energy, in natural opposition to the liquid quality of earthly waters. The NƒÅga is an earth symbol that, in its embodiment in serpentine form, partakes of the magical symbolic properties of liquids. The liquid of the serpent is especially fascinating because it is a poison. The Galon is the killer of serpents, and thus the possessor of supernatural power against all forms of lethal poison. Therefore, it is not surprising that most Burmans regarded certain tattoos as effective protection against snakebite. Perhaps at some time in history the tattoo dyes or needles had some genuine medicinal property. On this count we can only speculate, but, in any case, it was a well-entrenched article of Burmese belief. Thus the Galon itself was a symbol or effecter of invulnerability. The Galon has a third vital symbolic role: in most depictions, the Galon is a vehicle for Vishnu, one of three great deities of the Brahmanic universe. Therefore, the Galon is also regarded a super-potent, triple-threat protector. Different Interpretations Discussions about the Saya San Rebellion often revolve around its causes and characters. Scholars have studied on it and produced several interpretations in order to locate Saya San's position in Burmese history and examine the rebellion from different aspects. On the eve of the rebellion, the leading Burmese newspaper, Thu-ri-ya (The Sun) had published an article ‚ÄúA Warning to the British Government‚Äù which spoke of Burma as a ‚Äúkeg of dynamite‚Äù which could explode at any time. The British government had recorded this event into a report ‚ÄúThe Origin and Causes of the Burma Rebellion (1930-1932)‚Äù, which was published by 1934. It became the fundamental resource for over eighty years. According to the reportÔºö As regards the causes it is well known: (1) that the Burman is by nature restless and excitable; (2) that in spite of a high standard of literacy the Burman peasantry are incredibly ignorant and superstitious‚Ä¶ Thus, to the authorities, the rebellion could be explained with the framework of superstition. In addition, it rejected any political causes for the rebellion. D.G.E. Hall, one of the pioneers of writing history on Southeast Asia, who is also a famous British Burma historian, disagrees with the reports‚Äô finding. In terms of the cause of the rebellion, he posited political factors rather than economic ones. However, he also recognized the economic discontent. While some scholars have suggested that economic hardship was at the heart of the revolts, others have suggested that initiating a new golden age of Buddhism was an important reason. After the independence of Burma, historians tend to analyze the rebellion in more diverse perspectives. For those Burmese historians, Saya San was portrayed as an early nationalist hero. These interpretations stressed on economic factors, which was the cause of popular dissatisfaction. Different from the British discourse, the economic grievances could be the base of the movement. The movement was not aimless, instead, it was rational and justifiable. John Cady is the first western historian to term the rebellion the ‚ÄúSaya San rebellion‚Äù. He used a vast amount of British documents, including parliamentary papers and police reports, to create a narrative by recognizing the localized form of political expression. In his book A history of modern Burma, he wrote\\"...it was a deliberately planned affair based on traditional Burmese political and religious patterns.‚Äù There are also researches that focus on the economic perspective. Written a generation later and no doubt infused with the intellectual currents that informed both peasant studies and Southeast Asian studies, Michael Adas' The Burma delta (1974)amazon and James C. Scott's The moral economy of the peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia (1976)amazon and Ian Brown's A colonial economy in crisis: Burma's rice cultivators and the world depression of the 1930s (2005)amazon provided in-depth analyses into the economic conditions underlying the uprisings in the 1930s. For these scholars (like their earlier Burmese colleagues), the traditional vocabulary of the rebellion was less a factor in the cause of the insurgency than the unforgiving demands of the rational state's economy. One can also consider E. Manuel Sarkisyanz‚Äôs Buddhist Background of the Burmese Revolution employed the idea of Buddhist millenarian to examine the Saya San rebellion. It represented a transition from those earlier studies which trapped in a context of colonialism or nationalism to those discourses which paid attention to the cultural ideas within a more indigenous context. From 1970s onwards, the ‚Äúautonomous history‚Äù seems to become the tendency of historiography, which reconstructed those historical figures and events by analyzing indigenous culture from the local people's point of view. Another important book regarding Saya San is Michael Adas‚Äôs Prophet of Rebellion. On the one hand, Adas emphasized that a ‚ÄòProphetic leader‚Äô has ability to start up a millenarian movement. He also provides four other examples to justify his theory in bigger colonial situations. Maitrii Aung-Thwin's book, ‚ÄúThe Return of the Galon King: history, law, and rebellion in colonial Burma.‚Äù offers a critical assessment of the history and impact of the narrative of the Saya San revolt, an event taken as formative for Burmese history and studies of peasant rebellion worldwide. This work shows that despite all efforts to write social science objectively, ideology still rules. While those interpretations have emerged, scholarship has raised many questions about Saya San's role in the revolt. For example, if the British falsified and overstated Saya San's role in the revolt so as to make his execution seem more meaningful than it actually was. Several details of the trial, including a diary produced by the police which outlines Saya San's plan, are not considered to be trustworthy. Timeline of the Saya San Rebellion This is a timeline of the rebellion as outlined by historian Parimal Ghosh. 1930 *22 December: Rebels strike in the villages around Pashwegyaw. At least two killed. *23 December: Authorities call up 100 military police from Rangoon. Rebels descended on Inywa, killing three. *24 December: Rebels raided Weywa, killing two. They also attack a 50-strong military post of military police in Yedaik. *30 December: Rebels attempt to dynamite the railway bridge north of Inywa. *31 December: 500 rebels challenged military police and get fired upon. Deaths ensue. 1931 *4 January: Rising spreads into Yamethin district. *7 January: A better-organized revolt took place in Dedaye township. *April: Dacoit gangs attack village headmen and other village officers. *May: Government beefs up forces in Tharrawaddy and Insein with additional strength of 728 civil police. *June: 500 rebels attack the Wettigan police station. *July: The government published an amnesty offer in Henzada, Prome, Thayetmyo, Insein and Tharrawaddy to allow ‚Äòmisguided villagers‚Äô to ‚Äòreturn to respectability and freedom by surrendering‚Äô. This offer was not open to those who had participated in a dacoity, or murder of officials or villagers. *1 July: Rebels open fire on a police party from Taungbyauk. *2 July: 150 rebels lost 40 men trying to check government troops crossing the Nulu river. *12 July: Decisive showdown near Sinsakan when a party of 80 rebels attacked government troops under Captain Dart. *End July: Three of his followers are arrested, and Saya San retreats to Shan territory. *August: News emerges about two rebel armies called the ‚ÄòTiger‚Äô and the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô in the Paungde sub-division. Government accounts described them as just two dacoit gangs. At this time there is also news of ‚Äòwidespread disloyalty‚Äô in the villages. *1 August: The Emergency Powers Ordinance 1931 was promulgated, and effectively muzzled the press. The government version of the rebellion was given full exposure, and leaflets, posters and handbills were broadcast. *2 August: Saya San is arrested by Hsipaw State officials in Hsumhsai with five others. Saya San's movement is on the decline, and government pressure increases almost everywhere. *10 September to 13 October: Two columns were set up in the Minhla township of Thayetmyo. These columns were composed of detachments from the 14th Field Company and troops of mounted military police. This force was armed rifles, machine guns, and grenades. They visited almost every village in the township. At this time, the government also began to put relatives and sympathisers of the rebels into concentration camps. *23 September: A ‚Äòcult of the sun and the moon‚Äô led by two leaders Saya Chit and Yin Gyi Aung attacked Tazaung village, killing one person. Headmen of the neighbouring Shweindon village arrived to fight, shooting seven rebels and catching twenty others. *October: Several important leaders of the ‚ÄòLions‚Äô were killed, some were arrested, and some surrendered. This put the group under pressure. The ‚ÄòTigers‚Äô also struggled. *24 October: The ‚ÄòTiger's camp was surrounded by the military. They fought, leaving fifteen of their people dead, including a number of their leaders. *28 November: Saya San is executed Significance of the Saya San Rebellion The Saya San rebellion was one of the greatest anti-colonial movements in Southeast Asia in the 20th century, leaving thousands of people dead by the time it had concluded. However, the legacy left behind is that he is still regarded as a national hero to this day, a figure for national unity, and he has even been immortalized in the Burmese banknote. The Saya San rebellion is useful because it can help us to understand other revolts and revolutions throughout Southeast Asia especially during the colonial period. The Saya San rebellion case-study demonstrates how contesting historiographies do have an effect on the production of history. Because the colonial narrative formed the dominant discourse of the period, that discourse was able to control the narratives based on the archival data, despite them being biased and framed from only the colonial perspective. In other words, the so-called official archives about the Saya San rebellion did not tell us much about the rebellion, except for the administrative context that combined mostly only disciplines of ethnology, law and geography to reconstruct the narrative. Consider the Thai Nguyen rebellion or the Tinh Soviet movement that were also happening around the same time as the Saya San rebellion. There were also other sources that could allow us to acquire different perspectives. David Marr writing on Vietnam posits a 'Resistance model' or schema. According to him, there is traditional resistance, typically led by scholar elites. Following this there is a transitional resistance, led by scholar elites trying to be progressive. Finally there is the modern resistance, led by Western-educated leaders. When we overlay the Saya San narrative over David Marr's model of resistance, we can see that the Saya San movement contains elements of both traditional and modernity encapsulated within its nature. James Scott, in writing about revolts in Vietnam and Burma during the early 1900s, comments that these movements are not so much about objective economic conditions, but rather subjective economic conditions. He points to an idealized moral economy that existed before the Western colonial rule, where wealth was re-distributed, with reciprocal rights and obligations that linked village elites with the village people. With the arrival of colonial rule, the people that were able to survive from the distributive networks are thus unable to carry on their livelihoods like before. Other than framing the rebellion in terms of tradition or modernity, another way of looking at the rebellion is from the perspectives of violence, ideology, and utopia. For example, we can focus on how violence determined the contours of the movement, and also how ideological amalgamated with visions of utopia in the leaders moulded the eventual outcome of the movement. But can we consider the rebellion to be successful? Does the death of Saya San necessarily mean it was unsuccessful? At that point, to the colonial administrators, it does seem to have been an unsuccessful rebellion. However, the future repercussions were strong. In fact, two years after his capture, the movement still continued. At the same time, Saya San today still evokes sentiments of nationalism, if not patriotism. Also, despite him existing in the modern period, post-colonial narratives still continue to focus on the superstitious aspects such as the tattoos and amulets that he and his people used. Perhaps what future generations can learn about from the Saya San rebellion is to never assume the complete legitimacy of a source simply because it is the dominant discourse. It could have political repercussions, but it is still useful to always re- examine sources, perspectives, narratives, and historiographies to tease out certain insinuations or biases. Once a re-reading is done, more comprehensive viewpoints whether retrospective or not, could literally change the future. As George Orwell puts it, \\"He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.\\" Footnotes External links *Famous People, Saya San *Saya San Bibliography *Maurice Collis, Trials in Burma (London, 1934).

The name Claris was derived from Juan dela Cruz Palaris, the leader of the 1762 Spain revolt of Binalatongan (San Carlos). Claris was named in honor of Palaris, king of Pangasinan. Father Asencio suggested Pozorrubio to honor Governor-General dela Torre alias Conde de Pozor-the Count of Pozor, adding RUBIO. Don Benito, Sr. Domingo Castro, Don Domingo Aldana and DonAgustin Venezuela, proceeded to Manila by carruaje (stagecoach pulled by four horses) to deliver the second petition to the Queen of Spain was Isabel II, which was granted on August 13, 1868. Santa Philomena became the Town's Patron Saint with the feast day of August 13. She is, as believed by her devotees within the Catholic Church, a young virgin martyr whose remains were discovered in 1802 in the Catacombs of Priscilla. Three tiles enclosing the tomb bore an inscription that was taken to indicate that her name (in the Latin of the inscription) was Filumena, the English form of which is Philomena. The remains were removed to Mugnano del Cardinale in 1805 and became the focus of widespread devotion, with several miracles credited to the saint's intercession, including the healing of Venerable Pauline Jaricot in 1835, which received wide publicity. Saint John Vianney attributed to her intercession the extraordinary cures that others attributed to himself.

Santo Daime ( is a syncretic religion founded in the 1930s in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Acre by Raimundo Irineu Serra,Mestre Irineu photos known as Mestre Irineu. Santo Daime incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including Folk Catholicism, Kardecist Spiritism, African animism and indigenous South American shamanism, including vegetalismo. Ceremonies -- trabalhos (Brazilian Portuguese for \\"works\\") -- are typically several hours long and are undertaken sitting in silent \\"concentration\\", or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. Ayahuasca, referred to as Daime within the practice, which contains several psychoactive compounds, is drunk as part of the ceremony. The drinking of Daime can induce a strong emetic effect which is embraced as both emotional and physical purging. Santo Daime churches promote a wholesome lifestyle in conformity with Irineu's motto of \\"harmony, love, truth and justice\\", as well as other key doctrinal values such as strength, humility, fraternity and purity of heart. The practice became a worldwide movement in the 1990s. History Santo Daime, sometimes called simply the 'Doctrine of Mestre Irineu',Paragraph 5, \\"What is our religion?\\" Cefluris, 2000, accessdate 2010-03-07 is the name given to the religious practice originally begun in the 1920sThe history of Santo Daime in 'The Santo Daime Doctrine', an interview with Alex Polari de Alverga - Shaman's Drum #22 - Winter 1990-91 in the far western Brazilian state (then territory) of Acre by Raimundo Irineu Serra, a migrant from Maranh√£o in Brazil's northeast region. Irineu Serra was born in Brazil in 1892 to African parents and migrated to the Western Amazon region in 1912, attracted by a boom in the rubber-tapping industry. He first drank ayahuasca in the border region between Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru. As a result of experiencing a series of visions whilst spending eight days in solitude in the forest, he began to conduct spiritual ceremonies using ayahuasca. Many people came to him sick, seeking healing they could not afford or failed to find in standard medical practice.Personal Accounts Contemporary of Irineu Serra. Originally, Santo Daime teachings had no basis in written text, as early practitioners were illiterate, \\"Occasionally hymns were written down by hand; it is worth recalling that the majority of followers -- including the 'owners' of hymnals -- were illiterate or nearly so. People learned the hymns during the spiritual works, by ear,\\"... \\"the use of ayahuasca potions, more so than any other entheogenic drug we know, has survived the onslaught of literacy and acculturation, to make a place for itself in the New Order\\" , who is in turn referring to Jonathan Ott (1993:242) learning being experiential, through singing of inspired hymns exploring the perennial values of love, harmony, and strength through poetic and metaphorical imagery. The hymn collections of early practitioners have since become the sacred works of the doctrine. Ritual Devotional in context, the songs praise divine principles. The Cross of Caravaca (named after Caravaca, Spain, where the style originated), with its double horizontal beam, stands on the altar. Each session begins and ends with Christian prayers. Santo Daime practice features several kinds of rituals. Two of these are concentra√ß√µes (\\"concentrations\\") and bailados (\\"dances\\"), also known as hin√°rios (\\"hymnals\\"). Other rituals focus on reciting the rosary or on healing. Participants drink Daime in all types of rituals; but the format and focus will differ; concentrations are silent, seated meditations, while hymnals involve dancing and singing hymns while playing maracas. The Christian core is combined with other elements, such as an emphasis on personal gnosis and responsibility, an animist appreciation of nature, such as the Sun, Moon and Stars, as well as the totemic symbol of the beija-flor (hummingbird). Spiritual beings from indigenous Amazonian shamanism and deities from the African pantheon such as Ogum and Iemanj√° are also incorporated into the doctrine. The nature of the work is sometimes personified and addressed as Juramidam, a name disclosed to Irineu in his visionary experience, which means literally, \\"God (jura) and his soldiers (midam)\\". Ayahuasca, consumed by Daimistas in ceremonies, has many different traditional names, but is known within the Santo Daime as Santo Daime, meaning Holy Daime, or simply, Daime, as originally named by Irineu. Dai-me (with a hyphen) means \\"give me\\" in Portuguese. A phrase, Dai-me for√ßa, dai-me amor (\\"give me strength, give me love\\"), recurs in the doctrine's hymns. Participants in the ritual come to submit themselves to a process through which they may learn. This may include various wonders -- ayahuasca is known for the visions it generates, and the sense of communion with nature and spiritual reality -- as well as more mundane, less pleasant lessons about the self. The Daime is thought to reveal both positive and various negative or unresolved aspects of the individual, resulting in difficult \\"passages\\" involving the integration of this dissociated psychological content. Ceremonies are referred to as \\"works\\". The effects of Daime combined with dancing, singing and concentration for up to twelve hours require and develop stamina or firmeza (firmness). Santo Daime hymns The teachings of Santo Daime are transmitted through its hymns which, when sung, are intended to facilitate first-hand experience of the divine. Musical accompaniment often includes the unison rhythmic playing of maracas, in strict 4:4, 3:4 or 4:6 time, along with typical folk instruments such as the guitar, accordion and flute. Irineu's hymn book contains 129 songs and chronicles his spiritual journey and evolution from when he began drinking the Daime until his death. Through the singing of his hymns, the participant may connect with the spirit, teachings, and experience of Irineu and, in many ways, begin walking the same spiritual path. The singing of the hinarios of early and senior members of the church coincides with official dates on the Santo Daime calendar.C√©u do Mapi√° calendar of Works A significant proportion of members of the Santo Daime community also make collections of unique songs that they experience internally in connection with their practise. The process of experiencing such new songs in this context is referred to as \\"receiving\\". Denominational diversification The death of Mestre Irineu in 1971 resulted in a diversification within the Santo Daime community.Genealogy of the Santo Daime doctrine From a global perspective, the most significant of these occurred when Sebasti√£o Mota de Melo, commonly called Padrinho Sebasti√£o (\\"Godfather Sebasti√£o\\"), left the original center with a group of his followers, and formed a distinct group known as CEFLURIS (now called ICEFLU). Many of Padrinho Sebasti√£o's followers were Brazilians from the country's affluent south or citizens of other South American countries who were interested in Daime because of their experience with middle-class counterculture. According to church documents, this split also entailed disagreement over the use of cannabis. Followers of Padrinho Sebasti√£o believed cannabis to be a healing plant teacher, and referred to it as Santa Maria, access date 2010-03-21 Section \\"The Angel of Santa Maria\\", Interview with Padrinho Alfredo, April 1996 using it in ceremony to help their mediumship (embodying of spirits for the purpose of healing). Subsequently, CEFLURIS formally addressed the issue of the ceremonial use of cannabis, and its use is now officially prohibited in and around the spiritual works. Followers of Mestre Irineu's original church have always regarded the use of cannabis, as well as mediumship generally, as outside the doctrine. Some churches in northern Brazil who denounce cannabis will still sing some hymns of Padrinho Sebasti√£o, but only the ones he received before ever using cannabis. In the early 1980s Padrinho Sebasti√£o moved the church headquarters to the village of C√©u do Mapi√°, in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Control of CEFLURIS was increasingly shared with its members who joined the movement in the 1970s, and in the 1980s CEFLURIS established centers in southern Brazil. The group now has affiliates in North America, Europe, and Japan, as well as throughout Brazil. Ayahuasca Ayahuasca (called \\"Santo Daime\\" in Santo Daime religion) waiting for the beginning of the ceremonial work. Photo is digitally processed to protect anonymity of participants. Ayahuasca, which contains the psychoactive compound dimethyltryptamine (DMT), has been the subject of increasing legal scrutiny in the last few decades as Santo Daime has expanded. The decoction has been explicitly legal for religious use in Brazil since 1986, while recent legal battles in Europe have legalized its use in the Netherlands and Spain. In the United States, the Supreme Court in 2006 upheld a preliminary injunction permitting another Brazilian church, the Uni√£o do Vegetal (UDV), to use ayahuasca ritually. This decision, as the result of specific litigation involving the UDV, applies only to that group, so the legal status of ayahuasca generally remains in a gray area in that country. Santo Daime's entheogenic sacrament, ayahuasca, has been used for millennia in South American indigenous cultures. It is one of the traditional tools of the shaman in South America, and in many regions is to this day a common medicine used for finding and treating various ailments as well as for its vision-inducing effects, which are said to be profound and life-changing. The tea has had many names including Santo Daime (or simply Daime), Hoasca, Ayahuasca, Yage, and Caapi. It is made from two or more plants, one a woody vine (Ayahuasca vine or Jagube; generally Banisteriopsis caapi), and the others known as admixtures. While various plants are used throughout South America, most of which have high concentrations of dimethyltryptamine, the preferred admixture in the case of Santo Daime is Psychotria viridis, known to church members as the \\"Queen of the Forest,\\" after the figure who is said to have appeared to the church's founder in a vision, prompting him to start the religion. DMT occurs naturally in the human body and is speculated to be released at the time of death, but it is normally digested in the stomach if consumed and an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), in this case tetrahydroharmine, harmine and harmaline, is needed to allow it to reach the brain in this way, thus the use of the vine. The Santo Daime Church uses only the Jagube vine and the Viridis leaf, not adding any other plants to the mixture. The tea is prepared ceremoniously over a week by members of the church in a festival called a 'feitio'. Hymns are sung, and Daime is drunk while the men hammer the vine into powder and the women clean and sort the leaves. Because of the very specific manner in which they prepare their sacrament, and the very specific way in which they use it, the beverage is not called 'Ayahuasca', but 'Santo Daime'. In some communities there are very clear distinctions. Legal status Due to their usage of ayahuasca as a sacrament and the spread of the religion, Santo Daime has found itself at the center of Court battles and legal wrangling in various countries. =Brazil= In Brazil, CONFEN (the Federal Drug Council) has consistently upheld the right of the Daime Church to practice its religion and healing practices using the Daime. A study was made of the Daime by the CONFEN in 1987Resolu√ß√£o N¬∫ 4 CONFEN, 30 de julho de 1985Resolu√ß√£o N¬∫ 06 CONFEN ‚Äì 04 de fevereiro de 1986 which included visits to the various churches and observation of the making of the Daime. It also included study of another group of ayahuasca users, who call the drink vegetal (Uni√£o do Vegetal - UDV). The work groupCONAD Multidisciplinary Working Group MWG Ayahuasca ‚Äì Brazil (2006) which made the study included representatives not only of the CONFEN but also of several other government agencies. The conclusionResolu√ß√£o N. 1 CONAD ‚Äì 25 de Janeiro de 2010 of the study was that the Daime was a very positive influence in the community, encouraging social harmony and personal integration. The study noted that, rather than simply considering the pharmacological analysis of the plants, it was essential to consider the whole context of the use of the tea‚Äîreligious, social, and cultural. =United States= In the United States, court battles over ritual use of ayahuasca have mostly been fought by the UDV, and practitioners of the Santo Daime doctrine are watching these events closely. So far, UDV has been able to continue practicing legally thanks to Supreme Court decisions that soundly rejected attempts by the government to prohibit it. As of September 2008, UDV is in negotiations with the Drug Enforcement Administration regarding regulation of their use of ayahuasca.Government‚Äôs request to the Supreme Court to review the caseSupreme Court decision in the UDV case In September 2008, the three Oregon Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status.Oregon Daime case documents Their trial ended January 23, 2009. The case, Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey, presided over by Judge Owen M. Panner, was ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church. In March 2009, Panner found that the use of hallucinogenic tea by members of such churches was legal, issuing an injunction barring the government from penalizing them for its consumption. = Canada = In June 2017 the Santo Daime Church C√©u do Montr√©al received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals. C√©u de Toronto also received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals. =Europe= In the Netherlands, Santo Daime won a court case in 2001Court Case in Holland against the use of ayahuasca by the Dutch Santo Daime Church. By Arno Adelaars which allowed them to continue their ceremonial usage of ayahuasca.Dutch Santo Daime Case 2001 ‚Äì Abridged Judgment One factor in this decision was a fax from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control BoardLetter of Herbert Schaepe Secretary of the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health, stating that [P]reparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention. In France, Santo Daime won a court case allowing them to use the decoction in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled. Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared stup√©fiants, or narcotic scheduled substances, making the Daime and its ingredients illegal to use or possess. The most recent decision came in Italy in 2006;Italian Santo Daime juridical case resume and comment an eight-month-long investigation had led to the arrest of 24 Italian Santo Daime members in early 2005, but the May 2006 ruling found that no sufficient evidence had been presented to demonstrate that the church members had broken Italian law. Academic research Two particularly important research projects are worth highlighting. The first is the official investigation made by the Brazilian government at the end of the 1980s, which resulted in the legalization of the religious use of ayahuasca in Brazil in 1992. The second is 'The Hoasca Project' developed by a collective of international scholars.Theses and texts of NEIP researchers, developers and corresponding (Interdisciplinary Group for Psychoactive Studies) The Hoasca Project presented important findings regarding the use of ayahuasca as an agent of healing, something it is famous for in its indigenous context. Another longitudinal research using a control group, but also controlling for rural vs. urban area, was conducted by a team of Spanish researchers and looked at church members that have used ayahuasca for 15 years and at least 2 times per month. The study was led by Jos√© Carlos Bouso and funded by MAPS. The study \\"found no evidence of psychological maladjustment, mental health deterioration or cognitive impairment in the ayahuasca-using group.\\" Notes  External links  *Santo Daime Memory and Documentation Center *Official site of the Santo Daime * The Juramidam Family Independent site about the Santo Daime history * Effects of Ayahuasca on Psychometric Measures of Anxiety, Panic-like and Hopelessness in Santo Daime by the Journal of Ethnopharmacology Category:Ayahuasca Category:New religious movements Category:Psychedelic drug advocates Category:Religious organizations using entheogens Category:Religious syncretism in Brazil ","title":"Santo Daime"},{"id":"2069128","text":"', officially the ' (; ; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. It is sometimes called as Carmen, based on its prominent barangay of the same name (now split into two barangays). Rosales was created as a separate municipality through a Royal Decree in 1852. It was named in honor of Don Antonio Rosales. Philippine National Author and internationally renowned novelist Francisco Sionil Jos√® has set a monument to the town he grew up in with his five-novels-series The Rosales Saga. The town itself is dotted with ancestral houses and heritage structures deemed as important cultural sites via the National Cultural Heritage Act. Rosales is a junction town for those travelling between the provinces of Tarlac and Nueva Ecija to the other towns of Pangasinan. It is accessible via the NLEX (North Luzon Expressway) and TPLEX (Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway), or via the MacArthur Highway.

However, Spanish records revealed that Rosales was originally a ranchera founded by a pioneering Filipino named Nicolas Ba√±ez. It was declared a pueblo in 1852. The place was named in honor of Don Antonio Rosales Liberal, a man noted for his rectitude, industry, and learning. He is also an Order of the Royal Audiencia in Manila and a Consejero de Filipinas en el Ministro de Ultramar (Secretary of Foreign Affairs) during that time.

Tamayo Economy Although a large part of Santa Barbara is fast getting urbanized, the main economic activity remains farming. Rice remains its main crop with 6,662 hectares or close to all its total tillable lands devoted to rice farming. The second most important crop is mango of which the town is famous as the home of age-old Philippine mango seedling nurseries, a veritable home industry in town. Rice and mango are the only crops that are raised in all its 29 barangays. The third most important crop are a variety of vegetables followed by corn. Legumes and root crops are grown in small quantities. Their livestock include cattle, carabao, hogs, goats and dogs. They likewise raise native chickens for their food and some poultry farms commercially produce chicken layers and broilers. Out of the farm produce, Santa Barbara has developed its own food processing industry that includes the making of rice cakes like latik and suman, nata-de coco making, and pickles from different fruits. It likewise has a highly developed clay tiles and pottery industry coupled with non-farm based processing industries like candle and soap making and the making of hollow blocks for construction. The town has one industrial plant, the Ginebra San Miguel gin manufacturing plant in Tebag West barangay along the national highway towards Dagupan. The town‚Äôs business and trading center in and around the public market features a variety of wholesale and retail and other services establishments from farm inputs to construction materials. The market serves as the place where its people buy their needs and sell their produce. Transportation between the commercial center and the many barangays is served by a large fleet of individually owned tricycles. Santa Barbara‚Äôs close proximity to Urdaneta City, has, however, constrained the growth of its trading sector. Demographics Santa Barbara is populated mainly by Pangasinans with a sprinkling of other ethnic groups led by the Ilocanos. It is largely a suburban community with much of its population densely concentrated in 29 barangays. By the year 2016, the town‚Äôs population was projected to have reached 86,269, with a growth rate of 3.75 percent per year for the past seven years, faster than the national average. More than half of the families or roughly 60 percent are farmers who till the northern part of the rich Agno Valley. Average family income as of the 2000 national census, was a low P9,662.67 a year. Maybe because the average farming family does not buy, but produce the bulk of its own food, family expenditures were lower at P7,545.42. The average Santa Barbaran family has a disposable income of over P2,000 a year despite statistical data that had shown that a family In the Ilocos region needed PhP 14,749.00 in income a year to survive. A high level of self- sufficiency in food is likewise gleaned in the town‚Äôs minimal rate of malnutrition of only .50 percent severely malnourished out of 5.12 percent malnourished -pre-school children. The public school system is also proud of having an unusually low drop-out rate in the elementary grades and high school. Poverty rate in Santa Barbara is high as average income is even lower than the regional poverty threshold. But food self-sufficiency has saved its town folks from sliding to the ranks of the very poor. Climate Religion The heritage Santa Barbara Parish of the Holy Family Church, built in 1716, is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan, Vicariate III. Rev. Fr. Fidelis B. Layog is its Parish Priest and Rev. Fr. Jim Cerezo is its Parish Vicar.

As of mid-2008, it has attracted to its territory eight different housing projects including subdivisions developed by the company owned by Senate President Manny Villar and a pilot Gawad Kalinga housing project for the very poor embarked by the town government and its private sector partners. Infrastructure The town has a total of 137.509 linear kilometers of road network classified into national, provincial, municipal and barangay roads. All the national highways passing through town and those under the town government have been paved. The 17 kilometers of provincial roads are about three fourths paved while more than half (67.10%) of 92.5 kilometers of barangay roads otherwise known as farm to market roads, needed concreting. Unlike paved roads, electricity has reached all of the town‚Äôs 29 barangays with about 80 percent of all households served. Power rates are much lower than in Metro Manila for both households, commercial and industrial users. Two of the biggest landline telephone companies, PLDT and Digitel, plus one wireless company, Smart, serves the communication needs of the town although units to users ratio as of 2007 was still low at one phone for every 93 residents. The local government-run Rural Health Unit and its 10 satellite barangay health centers, plus seven private medical clinics and one dental clinic serve the basic health needs of Santa Barbara residents. Education Santa Barbara has an extensive public elementary and high school system. It has a total of 26 elementary schools supervised by two school districts plus seven public high schools. These are manned by 418 teachers and other school personnel with a student of over 15,000 children in any given year. Their healthy teacher to pupil ratio averaging one to 34 in the elementary grades and one is to 41 in high school and their minimal drop-out rates of two percent in the elementary grades and less than four in every 100 students that enter high school. This was the state of things in Santa Barbara when the local leadership changed in mid-2007.

Santa Maria was founded on January 10, 1855 and was governed by a Captain until 1863. In 1864 Santa Maria was incorporated into the municipality of Tayug due to Santa Maria's inability to maintain its financial stability. In 1877 the inhabitants of Santa Maria applied for separation, as a distinct municipality, from the municipality of Tayug. The application was granted and Santa Maria, again became a town under the governance of Captain Eugenio Vinluan. In 1903, the Americans arrived in Santa Maria and their rule began. In 1901 there was an election for the president of Santa Maria. This was during the United States military government of the islands. The President was given a two years term, due to his good administration. Again, in 1903, Santa Maria was incorporated into the town of Tayug. for financial reasons, as before, but in 1907 a special election was held for the purpose of returning all small municipalities that had incorporated with bigger towns. Don Alejandro Gonzales was then elected president and served until 1910 when he was succeeded by Don Mariano de Guzman who served to 1912. From this date, to the present, the different successions of presidents, alcaldes and mayors had occurred all over the islands. For many years, during the Spanish Regime, religion was the basis of educating the masses. From time to time missionaries of different orders were sent out to Santa Maria to carry out religious services as required of them. It was during the routine visit of a certain priest from the town of Asingan, which was then the most eastern town of the province of Pangasinan, who had extended his mission farther into the east and came to a village. The village was located on a plain in which the Agno River ran and which with a little effort could be irrigated. The missionary believed that the village could be developed into a prosperous community. Finding the residents to be hospitable, he chatted with them and, in the course of conversation, he thought of giving the place a name. Since it was the Virgin Mary's Day, he called the people of the village to him and with a simple but impressive solemnity proclaimed this place as Santa Maria on this, the Virgin Mary's day. In the course of time prominent people improved the locality and transferred the town site from Namagbagan, which is now a barrio of the municipality, to its present site near a clay promontory where it formed an impregnable defense against the yearly erosion of the Agno, thus annexing \\"De Pila\\" to the original name and making Santa Maria de Pila its final name, a name which is known beyond the confines of the province of Pangasinan. The town much progressive due to close proximity to Rosales and Tayug.

He at first became a monk (1825), and attached himself to the Barnabites at Naples, where he afterwards (1829) acted as professor of rhetoric. He left the church, and became best known as a provocative speaker against Catholicism, touring Europe and the United States. Protests against him broke out in Canada in 1853, causing numerous deaths in the Gavazzi Riots. Biography In 1840, having already expressed liberal views, he was removed to Rome to fill a subordinate position. Leaving his own country after the capture of Rome by the French, he carried on a vigorous campaign against priests and Jesuits in England, Scotland and North America, partly by means of a periodical, the Gavazzi Free Word. While in England he gradually went over (1855) to the Evangelical church, and became head and organizer of the Italian Protestants in London. Returning to Italy in 1860, he served as army-chaplain with Giuseppe Garibaldi. In 1870 he became head of the Free Church (Chiesa libera) of Italy, united the scattered Congregations into the Unione delle Chiese libere in Italia, and in 1875 founded in Rome the theological college of the Free Church, in which he himself taught dogmatics, apologetics and polemics. He died in Rome on 9 January 1889, aged 79. Among his publications are No Union with Rome (1871); The Priest in Absolution (1877); My Recollections of the Last Four Popes, etc., in answer to Cardinal Wiseman (1858); Orations, 2 decades (1851). Gavazzi Riots In the spring of 1853, Gavazzi visited North America. Gavazzi Riots were disturbances created in Quebec on 6 June 1853, and in Montreal, on 9 June, by mobs which attacked halls in which Gavazzi was lecturing. His lectures at Quebec and Montreal were strongly anti-Roman Catholic; and at both places the soldiers had to be called out to restore order. At Montreal, 10 lives were lost. The riots also caused political repercussions.W. Stewart WALLACE, ed., The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. III, Toronto, University Associates of Canada, 1948, 396p., pg. 13.

History The municipality was named after Spanish governor-general General Antonio de Urbiztondo y Villasis who acted as Spanish Governor in the Philippines and was also conqueror of the Muslims in Jolo from 1850 to 1852. He then issued a decree founding the town and consequently the newly formed town was named ‚ÄúUrbiztondo‚Äù in his honor. The Municipality of Urbiztondo's establishment as a town was primarily due to Fr. Ramon Dalmau, the parish priest of San Carlos, who began its foundation in 1852, separating the said town from San Carlos now a city. The initiative in the emergence of Urbiztondo came from the pioneering fathers from San Carlos, Pangasinan. Its creation has been credited to Rev. Father Ramon Dalmau, curate of San Carlos who worked hard for its founding on November 28, 1853. It remained a visita of San Carlos in the year 1852. It was separated from San Carlos on the above date when it was assigned its own curate. The Dominicans accepted Urbiztondo as a vicariate in 1855 designating Rev. Father Francisco Treserra who is also responsible for relocating the town to the place where it is now located.

Caboloan is the name of the primitive Pangasinan dialect, of which its purest form was spoken by the natives of Binalatongan. In 1718, Binalatongan was renamed (the Municipality [town] of) San Carlos. During the 1960s, the Municipality of San Carlos divided into two precincts. In 1965, the smaller precinct became legally incorporated as the Municipality of Basista by virtue of RA 4866. In 1966, the larger precinct became legally incorporated as San Carlos City by virtue of Republic Act No. 4487. On April 28, 2007, San Carlos City's former mayor, Julian V. Resuello, was assassinated during an event at the city's plaza. He later died after two days.

The Institute also publishes the award-winning journal, Southern Exposure and the noted blog and magazine, Facing South. History and background The Institute was founded in 1970 by veterans of the Civil Rights Movement, including Julian Bond, a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and Howard Romaine and Sue Thrasher, veterans of the Southern Student Organizing Committee. The founders believed a research and education institute was needed to help continue the momentum of 1960s movements for equality and justice, while moving into new areas such as labor rights, environmental protection and democratic reform. In 1973, the Institute began publishing Southern Exposure, a journal that became known for its investigative reporting into Southern power-brokers and its oral histories of Southerners involved in social change movements. In 2000, the Institute began publishing an email newsletter named Facing South. The newsletter highlights important news stories in the South and typically also includes a piece of progressive political analysis, as well as \\"The Institute Index,\\" statistics on a particular issue or theme. In 2005, the Institute launched an online blog, also called Facing South, which now averages more than 50,000 visitors a month. Since 2000, the Institute's executive director has been Chris Kromm, who has worked in the South as a journalist and public interest advocate since 1992. Current staff also include Sue Sturgis, Editorial Director; and Jerimee Richir, New Media Organizer. Research and education programs The Institute's research and outreach programs have focused on a broad range of issues, including economic justice, civil rights, environmental protection and democratic reform. Recent Institute initiatives have included * Gulf Coast Reconstruction Watch, a project tracking the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina; * the Peace and Security Program, which has examined the South's disproportionate ties to the military and the Iraq War; and, * the Environment and Energy Reporting Project, launched in 2008, which examines the political and economic influence of the energy industry in the South. Between 2000 and 2011, the Institute has also focused on the subject of voting rights in the South, especially the political participation of African- Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The Institute's Voting Rights Watch project has publicized such issues as the cost of voter ID laws,http://www.southernstudies.org/2011/02/report-voter-id-law-unaffordable- for-north-carolina.html barriers to student voting and voter registration \\"purges\\" that have prevented citizens from voting. Current research and education programs include the 2010 Census and Redistricting Project, the Energy and Environment Reporting Project, and the Freedom Journalism School, a new program to train Southern bloggers and new media journalists in how to conduct investigative reporting and public interest journalism. Southern Exposure In 1973, the Institute began publishing Southern Exposure, a journal covering a broad range of political and cultural issues, with a special emphasis on investigative journalism and oral history. Southern Exposure has been recognized with numerous major journalism awards, including two George Polk Awards (Magazine Reporting and Regional Reporting), a National Magazine Award (Public Interest Reporting), the John Hancock Award for Excellence in Business and Financial Journalism, and awards from Investigative Reporters and Editors, the National Press Club, the Society of Professional Journalists, and the White House Correspondents' Association. Notable authors who have contributed to Southern Exposure include Julian Bond, Anne Braden, Denise Giardina, Jim Hightower, Bernice Johnson Reagon, Stetson Kennedy, Mab Segrest, Lee Smith, Studs Terkel and Alice Walker. Southern Exposure published quarterly from 1973‚Äì2000 and 2002‚Äì2005. As the Institute has expanded its online media, it now publishes print issues of Southern Exposure twice a year. In 2003/2004, Southern Exposure published \\"Banking on Misery,\\" an award- winning investigative series that was one of the first in-depth reports on the growing predatory lending crisis, especially the leading role of Citigroup in predatory banking practices. The Columbia Journalism Review later credited Southern Exposure with breaking the story about Citigroup's dependence on subprime lending (three out of four loans originating from Citigroup in 2000 were from its subprime unit, Southern Exposure reported) and foreshadowing the 2007/2008 home credit crisis.Dean Starkman, \\"Tale of Two Citis,\\" Columbia Journalism Review, October 3, 2007 After a two-year hiatus, Southern Exposure resumed publication in 2011 with an issue about the health crisis facing Gulf Coast communities in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Since 1973, they constitute the national armed forces of Guinea-Bissau. A separate Cape Verdean branch of the FARP constituted the national armed forces of this country from 1975 until the early 1990s, when these were renamed \\"Cape Verdean Armed Forces\\". History In the process of the preparation of the armed struggle against the Portuguese rule over the then Portuguese Guinea, in 1962, the PAIGC established a Military Action and Organization Plan which defined the general scheme of a military structure. This plan foresaw two types of armed guerrilla groups: area or territorial groups and mobile or intervention groups. In the end of that year, these groups were already armed with hand grenades and PPSh-41 submachine-guns. The armed struggle finally started on 23 January 1963, with a guerrilla attack against the Portuguese garrison in Tite. In the I Congress of the PAIGC of 1963, a decision was taken to created the People's Army (Ex√©rcito Popular) and the People's Militia (responsible for the guarding of the liberated areas), as well to restructure the Guerrilla. This was to be done from the already existing units, staffed with personnel recently trained in China. In fulfillment of the decision taken in the I Congress, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People (FARP) were created in February 1964, being constituted by the then also created People's Army and by the already existent Guerrilla. The People's Militia was also created at that time, but was not part of the FARP, being instead dependent from the civil political and administrative bodies of the PAIGC. The main tactical unit of the FARP became the infantry bi-group (bigrupo), each being constituted by two or more infantry groups, headed by a commander and a political commissar and supported by heavy weapons. Each infantry group included around 18 elements armed with automatic weapons, three machine-guns and two rocket-propelled grenades. The structure of the bi-group was so well adapted to this type of warfare that some of the Portuguese units copied its organization, with General Sp√≠nola defending the general reorganization of all the Portuguese ca√ßadores (light infantry) companies accordingly with its model. Besides the bi-groups, the FARP also included independent specialized groups of sharpshooters, heavy mortars, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades, sappers, anti-tank guns and antiaircraft artillery, as well as artillery batteries. In 1971, the PAIGC proceeded to a deep restructuring of the FARP. These came to be constituted by the Nationalist Armed Forces (For√ßas Armadas Nacionalistas) or FAN and by the Local Armed Forces (For√ßas Armadas Locais) or FAL. The FAN included the already existing National People's Army (former People's Army) and the newly created National People's Navy. The bi-groups, independent groups and artillery batteries of the National People's Army were grouped in army corps and these were grouped in armies. The National People's Navy included both naval units as well as Marines (fuzileiros) units. The FAL were the former People's Militia, now being also integrated in the FARP. PAIGC unilaterally declared the independence of Guinea-Bissau on 24 September 1973, which was recognized by a number of countries. The FARP came so to be considered the national armed forces of the new state. The armed struggle continued however, as Portugal obviously did not recognize this independence, with its forces remaining in which it still considered as its province of Guinea. Finally, following the change of political regime caused by the Carnation Revolution, Portugal recognized the independence of Guinea-Bissau in 10 September 1974, withdrawing its military forces from the new country. When Cape Verde become independent in 1975, its newly created armed forces became also known as FARP, being constituted originally with some Cape Verdean elements that participated in the struggle in Guinea-Bissau. At this time, there were still plans to unite Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, with the two countries being ruled by PAIGC. This plan of unification was however abandoned, with the military of Cape Verde being renamed \\"Cape Verdean Armed Forces\\" in the early 1990s. Presently, the FARP continue to be the armed forces of Guinea-Bissau.

A single trail goes up to the mountain's summit from the Four Corners junction between Skylight and Mount Marcy, its northern neighbor; as the name suggests, however, there are three ways to get there. Most commonly, hikers come up from the west, via the Feldspar Brook Trail from the campsites at the Flowed Lands and climb the peak in conjunction with a visit to Lake Tear of the Clouds, often considered as the source of the Hudson River, and a climb up neighboring, trail-less Gray Peak. The trailhead can also be reached by descending from Marcy to the north, or via Panther Gorge and Elk Lake to the southeast, all very lengthy trips that are usually done via an overnight backpack.

Fuller in 1918 during World War I. His plan criticised the practice of physically destroying the enemy, and instead called for tanks to rapidly advance into the enemy's rear area to destroy supply bases and lines of communication, which would also be bombed. He suggested a lightning thrust toward the command center of the German Army: :\\"... every available bombing machine should concentrate on the various supply and road centres. The signal communication should not be destroyed, for it is important that the confusion resulting from the dual attack carried out by the and aeroplanes should be circulated by the enemy. Bad news confuses, confusion stimulates panic ‚Ä¶ (then) a carefully mounted tank, infantry and artillery attack should be launched, the objective of which is the zone of the enemy's guns: namely the secondary tactical zone some 10,000 yards deep.\\"Fuller (1936) p. 329 :\\"so does an army depend for its power on the will of its Commander and his Staff: cut that will off and the army will be paralyzed.\\" He proposed using Medium D tanks \\"to disorganise the enemy‚Äôs Command in rear of the entrenched zone.\\"Fuller (1936) p321, 334 The Allied advance and German retreat across France and Belgium in 1918 had begun to show some of the pace and aspects that would mark later mechanized warfare; British tanks played an increasing role, and German rear-guard defenses focused on stopping their advance. Although never implemented, Plan 1919 would have carried these trends forward earlier. Background By 1918, the German, French and British Armies had been through years of trench warfare and were approaching their breaking point. Both sides realised that a new form of warfare was needed for the successful conclusion of the war. Tanks, although used unsuccessfully at the Battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, were used in the Battle of Cambrai and demonstrated their usefulness. Although the main objective was not achieved, and the German artillery made short work of them after the initial shock had worn off, military theorists were inspired to try to incorporate them properly. Medium Mark D Tank In the spring of 1918, J.F.C. Fuller submitted a study, \\"The tactics of the attack as affected by the speed and circuit of the Medium D tank\\",Childs, D A Peripheral Weapon?: The Production and Employment of British Tanks in the First World War 1999 Greenwood Publishing p156 a bold new plan involving tanks and air support that aimed to target the German leadership and supply lines, as opposed to the tactic then used of grinding away at the main forces. Fuller's plan had three elements. The first was a fast attack by medium tanks and aircraft against the German headquarters, removing its ability to control their forces. Then, the main assault by heavy tanks, infantry and artillery would break the German lines. Finally cavalry, light tanks and infantry mounted on trucks would follow the retreating Germans to prevent them from reforming or counterattacking.Childs p156 His plan was to be used as the blueprint for the spring offensive the next year and was titled \\"Plan 1919\\". The German armistice in November 1918 precluded the implementation of the plan, but it was studied extensively by the Germans and used as the model for their Blitzkrieg attacks during the next war (Fuller). Plan 1919, although never carried out, laid the \\"groundwork\\" for numerous upgrades in military equipment, technology and tactics of modern warfare . Fuller's ideas were largely in line with papers put forward by other members of the Tank Corps such as by Capper and Elles' paper \\"The future of tank operations and production requirements\\", which envisaged tank forces of several thousand light, medium and heavy tanks and the means and the time necessary to produce them and then to deploy them to the front.Childs p155 Description Fuller, in his Military History of the Western World stated, \\"There are two ways of destroying an organization: 1. by wearing it down, 2. by rendering it inoperative. In war the first comprises the killing, wounding, capturing and disarming of the enemy's soldiers- body warfare. The second, the rendering inoperative of his power of command- brain warfare. To take a single man as an example: the first method may be compared to a succession of slight wounds which will eventually cause him to bleed to death; the second- a shot through the brain\\". To accomplish the \\"shot through the brain\\", Fuller's plan required generals to penetrate the enemy's defenses using tanks and targeting his chain of supply so that in the ensuing confusion the enemy leadership could then be eliminated decisively. The goal was \\"the destruction of the enemy's policy\\" (Reid). That would be accomplished by armored units penetrating the enemy lines and causing havoc in the rear areas, with the ultimate aim of eliminating the enemy leadership. The plan emphasised the intended use of aircraft in the support role, along with motorized infantry to conduct operations in terrain unsuited to tanks. That mobile form of operations utilizing tanks and aircraft was a huge departure from the established infantry tactics of the day. Detractors point out the flaws in Fuller's plan. It is a strong point that the tank required by the plan had not been fielded yet and that war-weary Britain could not afford the manpower and materials needed to implement it (Palazzo). Also, as was demonstrated at Cambrai, the German artillery was deadly against the current British tanks without accompanying artillery support. A new 40-ton tank design Mark VIII tank /, based on the earlier British heavy tanks, was under construction in late 1918 with an ambitious production scheme of up to 4,500 tanks. Hundreds would be used in the spearhead, and once they had broken through the German lines, the faster medium tanks would have \\"raced through\\" to disrupt the enemy rear. Aircraft would have been used to resupply the tanks and keep the breakthrough moving (Ellis). The British had a \\"trench fighter\\" design in production with orders for 1,400 aircraft. The Sopwith Salamander was armoured so that it could strafe and bomb the enemy trenches and artillery with less risk. Effect Plan 1919, although never carried out, laid the \\"groundwork\\" for upgrades in military equipment, technology and tactics of modern warfare. The Americans designed a new tank based on the British Medium *D\\" tank, as described by Fuller in his Plan 1919, to be able to execute the new mobile form of warfare (Hofmann) . The German blitzkrieg style of modern warfare was similar to Fuller's Plan 1919. That style of warfare emphasized the use of armored units and close air support to make quick attacks designed to penetrate the enemy's front lines and cause confusion (Fuller) . That type of warfare is still used today, as demonstrated by the American forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom when they first occupied Iraq. Theory Fuller's theory of having the tanks, aircraft, and numerous other warfare tactics prescribed in Plan 1919 was that a mobile battlefield would provide more protection against losses to friendly forces. Fewer soldiers put at risk on the battlefield implied fewer troops to command, thus making it easier for the commander to lead troops. More effective battles could then be fought with fewer casualties. Warfare could then become more organised. Superior firepower and air power would increase the combat effectiveness of attacking command and communication centres . Fuller drew up the plans for Plan 1919 with many beliefs and hopes for the future of armies in Europe and around the world. He believed that Plan 1919 was the groundwork for numerous innovations in the armed forces. The new armies would consist of highly-trained and proficient individuals who would be professional in how they acted and led on the battlefield. Fuller also believed that with time, military technologies would become more advanced and more proficient in their performed operations. That meant that technologies would thus become more deadly and more effective at destroying the enemy, allowing more pinpoint strikes and minimizing collateral damage . Chemical plan Fuller's plan was not the only option on the table for 1919. As Albert Palazzo points out in his paper \\"Plan 1919‚Äì The Other One\\", the chemical warfare planners had big plans for the next year's offensive. Palazzo pointed out that they were fielding a new gas, DM, which penetrated the German masks. The technology for the new gas was much closer to fruition than the tank required by Fuller's plan. In addition, Winston Churchill, as Minister of Munitions, had already called for the production of gas agents to be increased by five times the current production. The chemical advocates, therefore, did not have to contend with technology issues. They were using a proven method of warfare. Their plan called only for increasing the extent of chemical warfare. Palazzo also pointed out they intended to use aeroplanes as delivery systems for the chemical agents and that they envisioned the gas being used to target command centres. In many respects the gas advocates plan seems to have offered much the same possibility for success, with few of the implementation difficulties of Fuller's plan. The armistice, however, made their plans unnecessary as well. In the light of history, however, the plan remains obscure because of the nature of chemical warfare. As Palazzo put it, \\"few weapons have inspired such universal revulsion\\". References =Notes= =Bibliography= *Fuller, J.F.C. A Military History of the Western World Vol 3.

PGT-NDN was formed in 1978, following an internal rift within PGT. An attack of the Military Commission of PGT against a police convoy provoked the split, in which 25 police officers were killed. The central leadership of the party had denied involvement in the attack. A minority accused the leadership of being ambiguous towards the armed struggle against the regime. After a brief period the minority left PGT to form PGT-NDN. PGT-NDN won over the South-East Regional Committee, a part of the Southern Regional Committee and a part of the √Ålamos Zonal Committee (Chimaltenango) of PGT. Its leader was Jos√© Alberto Cardoza (nom de guerre: Mario S√°nchez), who had been a PGT Central Committee member up to the split. PGT-NDN had a programme of 'Revolutionary People's War'. PGT-NDN initiated a cooperation with EGP and FAR in 1979. In 1982 PGT- NDN, EGP, ORPA and FAR formed URNG as a coordinating body. After the 1983 capture of Carlos Quinteros ('Miguel'), who had been a leading figure in both PGT-NDN and PGT-PC, PGT-NDN was almost wiped out as Quinteros provided the state forces with vast information on their leaders and members. The party remained limited to Cardoza and his closest associates. In 1987, URNG substituted PGT-NDN for PGT in its leadership. However, the relations between PGT and PGT-NDN improved, and the two parties were able to hold a joint celebration of the 38th anniversary of the foundation of the party. During the 1990s, PGT-NDN continued to exist but had very limited activity. Cardoza died in 2003. It is not known whether the party still exists.

Revolutionary Movement 13th November (in Spanish: Movimiento Revolucionario 13 Noviembre) was a leftist movement in Guatemala. MR-13 was founded in 1960 by a group of dissident officers. It grew partly out of the popular protests against the government of President Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes following his election in 1958. It was led by Luis Augusto Turcios Lima, Marco Antonio Yon Sosa and Luis Trejo Esquivel. Alejandro de Le√≥n, co-founder of the group, was captured and shot by the judicial police in 1961. In 1963, MR-13 joined the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR). MR-13 nominally continued to exist until 1973, after it was severely hampered in the 1966-67 counterinsurgency by the Guatemalan government. Origins On 13 November 1960, a group of 120 young military officers joined by approximately 3000 enlisted soldiers seized the Zacapa military base and most of the Eastern Military Zone of the country and demanded the resignation of President Yd√≠goras. The rebels' discontent was fueled by the staggering corruption of the Yd√≠goras regime, the government's showing of favoritism in military promotions and in providing other rewards to officers who supported Yd√≠goras, and what they perceived as incompetence in running the country. The proximate trigger for the November 13 revolt, however, was Yd√≠goras' decision to allow the United States to train an invasion force in Guatemala to prepare for the planned Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. Yd√≠goras had not consulted the Guatemalan military about this decision and did not share with the military the payoff he received in exchange from the US government. The military just watched as unmarked US warplanes piloted by US-based Cuban exiles flew in large numbers over their country. The rebel officers were concerned about the loss of sovereignty for the country as the US established a secret air strip and training camp at Retalhuleu to prepare for its invasion of Cuba. The rebellion was not ideological in its origins.Michael McClintock, \\"The American Connection,\\" Volume Two: \\"State Terror and Popular Resistance in Guatemala,\\" (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1985), p. 49-50 Defeat and exile The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) flew B-26 bombers disguised as Guatemalan military jets to bomb the rebel bases because the coup threatened its plans for the invasion of Cuba as well as the Guatemalan regime it supported. The rebels fled to neighboring Honduras and formed the kernel of what became known as MR-13.Michael McClintock, \\"The American Connection,\\" Volume Two: \\"State Terror and Popular Resistance in Guatemala,\\" (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1985), p. 50 Return and civil war In early 1962 they returned and on 6 February 1962 in Bananera they attacked the offices of the United Fruit Company (present day Chiquita Brands), an American corporation that controlled vast territories in Guatemala as well as in other Central American countries. The attack sparked sympathetic strikes and university student walkouts throughout the country, to which the Yd√≠goras regime responded with a violent crackdown. This violent crackdown sparked the Guatemalan Civil War.Michael McClintock, \\"The American Connection,\\" Volume Two: \\"State Terror and Popular Resistance in Guatemala,\\" (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1985), p. 50 The MR-13 later initiated contact with the outlawed PGT (Guatemalan Labour Party; composed and led by middle-class intellectuals and students) and a student organization called the Movimiento 12 de Abril (April 12 Movement) and together with these groups merged into a coalition guerilla organization called the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) in December 1962. Also affiliated with the FAR was the FGEI (Edgar Ibarra Guerrilla Front) led by Luis Augusto Turcios Lima. The MR-13, PGT and the FGEI each operated in different parts of the country as three separate \\"frentes\\" (fronts); the MR-13 established itself in the mostly ladino departments of Izabal and Zacapa, the FGEI established itself in Sierra de las Minas and the PGT operated as an urban guerrilla front. Each of these three \\"frentes\\" (comprising no more than 500 combatants) were led by former members of the 1960 army revolt, who had previously been trained in counterinsurgency warfare by the United States. The US government supported the Guatemalan junta in the Guatemalan Civil War against MR-13 and other rebel factions as well as the civilians who supported them. A 1968 CIA report stated that: \\"With some assistance from Cuba, the small band, under the leadership of Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, engaged in sporadic terrorist acts, including harassment of communications lines, buses, and railroad tracks, pillaging of military supply points and plantations for money and arms, assassination of army collaborators, and attacks on commercial and official installations.\\"Central Intelligence Agency. Intelligence Memorandum. The Communist Insurgency Movement in Guatemala. 0624/68, September 20, 1968. In Guatemala and the U.S.; DNSA collection. An estimated 200,000 civilians were killed or \\"disappeared\\" during the civil war, most at the hands of the military, police and intelligence services of the Guatemalan regime. Victims of the repression included indigenous activists, suspected government opponents, returning refugees, critical academics, students, left-leaning politicians, trade unionists, religious workers, journalists, and street children on a scale that constituted genocide. The \\"Comisi√≥n para el Esclarecimiento Hist√≥rico\\" has estimated that 93% of violence in the conflict have been committed by government forces and 3% by the guerrillas.

The southernmost island municipality of the Batanes island group, Sabtang comprises primarily Sabtang Island, as well as two nearby smaller and uninhabited islands: Ivuhos and Dequey. The municipality is known for its lighthouse and the old stone houses of the Ivatan villages of Chavayan and Savidug. Like Batan Island to the north, Sabtang also has a few Mission-style churches and white sand beaches. History The Spanish missionary Fr. Artiquez first visited the Island of Sabtang in 1786Gonz√°lez Alonzo, Fr. Julio, O.P. (1966). \\"The Batanes Islands\\", in Acta Manilana, Manila: University of Santo Tomas Research Center after receiving an affirmative response from the island to learn about the Christian faith. The success of the first visit led to two more evangelical trips resulting in the baptism of 181 children and the study of the catechism among the adult natives. The evangelization of Sabtang was cut short due to the failing health of the Spanish missionaries. For this, the inhabitants of Sabtang remained faithful to old traditions especially in the administration of justice by vendetta and murder. In 1791, the then most powerful chief in Sabtang named Aman Dangat showed defiance of the government of Governor Joaquin del Castillo by killing the Spanish soldiers who went to Sabtang to procure supplies. Lieutenant Tomas Nu√±ez led the troops to capture the rebels. Aman Dangat was put to trial and admitted to the crime. He, later on, asked to be baptized. The inhabitants of Sabtang were then forced to resettle in San Vicente and San Felix in Ivana to be better supervised by the government. Some forty years after the resettlement, the Sabte√±os were allowed to visit their native island and gradually these visits allowed them to build homes in their erstwhile land. The government allowed this to happen on the condition that houses should be constructed in lowlands. To sustain the spiritual care for the Sabte√±os, a new mission was opened in Sabtang in 1845 under the patronage of Saint Vincent Ferrer with Fr. Antonio Vicente as its first vicar. Fr. Antonio Vicente is credited to have built the Sabtang Church, together with a convent, a school, and a courthouse. Geography Sabtang is located at .

According to the , it has a population of people. History Thousands of years before Spanish colonization, about a thousand people lived on fortified cliffs and hilltops scattered across today's Uyugan. The fortified settlements were called \\"Idiang\\" and derived from the Ivatan word \\"Idi\\" or \\"Idian\\" which means home or hometown. They belonged to the Ivatan tribes and spoke the same Ivatan language, but with a southern accent. The Ivatan tribes who called the place home farmed, where soil permitted, and they fished. They were also a boat-making and seafaring people, and they traded with neighbouring Taiwan to the North and Cagayan to the South. The Ivatan tribal settlements had a de facto tribal government, not very much different from that of tribal governments in the earlier stages of human evolution. The tribal settlement was headed by a chieftain with a deputy. Inter-tribal hostilities (Arap du Tukon) or War on the Hill were common in those days but for men only. Common law prohibited the harming of womenfolk who were the main providers of food in wartime. In the late 1600s, Dominican missionaries landed in Batanes. The native people were in the beginning not all that welcoming to the early Spanish colonizers, but slowly they were able to adopt themselves to the Spanish ways. The Spaniards had very different lifestyles, beliefs, and traditions than the Ivatan tribes. They didn't understand the native peoples' social customs, generous nature, religious beliefs, or love of the land. According to church records, the first mass and baptism in the islands was celebrated in what is now Imnajbu in Uyugan. The Spanish missionaries, finding the conditions harsh in Batanes, there were attempts to resettle the Ivatans in Cagayan, but they always found their way home - they sailed back to Batanes. In 1782, Spanish Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas sent an expedition to formally get the consent of the Ivatans to become subjects of the King of Spain. On June 26, 1783, de facto Ivatan independence was lost - a sad day to many Ivatans, but equally, a new beginning and a day of celebration to many other Ivatans. On that day (it's called Batanes Day today) the Spanish representatives of the King of Spain met the representatives of the chiefs and nobles of Batanes on the Plains of Vasay (in what is now Basco town) for the ceremonial formal annexation of Batanes to the Spanish Empire. The new province was named Provincia de la Conception. Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas was named \\"Conde de la Conquista de Batanes\\" and the capital town of Basco was named after him. The Dominican Order established missions, among them the San Jose de Ivana mission which included all of present-day Uyugan and Sabtang. The Americans followed the Spaniards to Batanes after the Spanish naval defeat at Manila Bay. The dropped anchor at Basco Bay in February 1900. In 1901, the province was reclassified to a township, but provincial status was restored in 1909, and with it the creation of Uyugan as a separate township (municipality). American public school system was introduced and general health and sanitation campaign was launched. In the 1930s, the Americans built a better road system that replaced the road system (El Camino Real) built during the Spanish period. Geography Uyugan is located at in the south-eastern part of Batan Island, bounded on the north by Mahatao, south by the Balintang Channel, east by the Philippine Sea, and west by Ivana. Uyugan is located at According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batanes. The Uyugan town proper (Centro or Idi to the Isantoninos) is from Basco, the provincial capital. It is located along the banks of what was once a brook, a kilometer east of the Ivana-Uyugan border. There are two other major settlements in the municipality situated along the Pacific seaboard: Itbud and Imnajbu. Itbud is from the town proper or Centro while Imnajbu is farther north-east. The land is varied. It changes from rocky hills along the coasts to grassy and forest hills in the interior. Most of the land has been cleared for farming. In the language of the Ivatans, Uyugan means place of flowing water‚Äîwhich is never far away except in the town proper itself: Today's brook bed that cuts the town proper in half dried up during the severe earth movements of 1918. Barangays Political Map of Uyugan, Batanes (Subject for Correction) Uyugan is politically subdivided into 4 barangays. Demographics In the , Uyugan had a population of . The population density was . Uyugan's population has not changed much since its founding as a separate township (municipality) on May 20, 1909. Its population is around a tenth of the population of Batanes. Half of Uyugan's population lives in the town proper or Uyugan Centro that comprises the barangays of Kayuganan and Kayvaluganan. The other half live in Itbud and Imnajbu. The four Uyugan barangays or municipal districts along the coasts and brooks. They grew up there because of the sea and fresh waters necessary for their livelihood. All of the barangays have a main street as the core of their socio-economic life. Most of the people speak Ivatan as their first language, while most of the people speak Ilocano, Tagalog, and English as their second languages. Climate Uyugan's climate ranges from humid oceanic to sub-tropic. The Philippine Sea/Pacific Ocean to the east moderate the climate‚Äîcooling summers. It's coldest in January and warmest in May. January temperatures average . May‚Äôs average temperatures range from . The average (mean) annual air temperature is less than in January, but it's much more changeable in north-eastern Uyugan (Imnajbu). Precipitation is heaviest during the non-summer months brought in by the typhoons that frequent the area. Uyugan's annual rainful varies, but is highest in the north and lowest in the south. The heaviest rainfuls happen in a belt lying inland from Mount Chakarangan in north-western Uyugan (Songet) to Mount Vatohayao in north- eastern Uyugan (Imnajbu). The weather is foggy at the onset of the colder months, caused by the cold polar air from the north (Continental Asia/Siberia) meeting warm moist air from the south. Economy The Uyugan economy is mainly agriculture and fishing. Farming in Uyugan began long before the arrival of the Spaniards. The Ivatans loved the land and cultivated many plants for food. Isantonino farmers started with root crops, but when the Spaniards arrived, they learned to grow other crops, while introducing livestock and vegetables. Farming meant growing root crops‚Äîoften just enough to feed the farmer's family. Camot√© and other root crops became Uyugan's most hardy and widely grown crops, but in the 1950s, livestock became more important than root crops on Uyugan farms. The government brought breeding bulls and the farmers moved to \\"mixed\\" farming on a small scale. Uyugan's farms are not scientific, but government agricultural extension workers give direction and support to farming methods. The farmers seldom have problems like plant and animal diseases and pests. Today's Isantonino farmer still could barely feed his family due to antiquated methods of farming dictated mainly by the topography of the land that at best is unsuitable to agriculture. Nevertheless, Uyugan was a leading producer of beef cattle and garlic prior to the global economy. Fishing plays a role in partly meeting the fish requirements of the municipality. Fishing methods use hook and line and cast nets. Situated north of Imnajbu is Madi Bay in Mahatao, one of the richest fishing grounds in all of mainland Batanes, where Isantoninos (Uyugan) along with Isancarnos (Mahatao) and other Ivatans (Ivasays) engaged in coastal fishing.

The hooker was developed for the strong seas there. It is identified by its sharp, clean entry, bluff bow, marked tumblehome and raked transom. Its sail plan consists of a single mast with a main sail and two foresails. Traditionally, the boat is black (being coated in pitch) and the sails are a dark red-brown. Recently there has been a major revival of and renewed interest in the Galway hooker, and the boats are still being painstakingly constructed. The festival of Cruinni√∫ na mB√°d is held each year, when boats race across Galway Bay from Connemara to Kinvara on the Galway/Clare county boundary.  Classes of Galway hooker  Galway hooker under sail at Belfast Titanic Maritime Festival, Queen's Quay, Belfast, Northern Ireland, June 2010 The hooker refers to four classes of boats. All are named in Irish. The B√°d M√≥r (big boat) ranges in length from 10.5 to 13.5 metres (35 to 44 feet). The smaller Leathbh√°d (half-boat) is about 10 metres (28 feet) in length. Both the B√°d M√≥r and Leathbh√°d are decked forward of the mast. These boats were used to carry turf to be used as fuel across Galway Bay from Connemara and County Mayo to the Aran Islands and the Burren. The boats often brought limestone on the return journeys, to neutralise the acid soils of Connemara and Mayo. The Gleoiteog ranges in length from 7 to 9 metres (24 to 28 feet), and has the same sails and rigging as the larger boats. They were used for fishing and carrying cargo. Another boat, the P√∫c√°n, is similar in size to the Gleoiteog but has a lug mainsail and a foresail. These smaller boats were entirely open.Scott There was also a class fitted with a cockpit floor over the ballast used for fishing. When the Irish settlers at Boston in North America needed fishing craft, they built the hooker that they knew from home. These boats became known as 'Boston Hookers', 'Irish Cutters' (in official reports), or 'Paddy Boats'.Chapelle While a very utilitarian boat, well suited for the shallow waters of Galway Bay and being capable of being beached where necessary, the Galway Hooker is prone to being swamped and sinking in a short time in the absence of a cabin and high freeboard. Eighty- two shipwrecks are recorded in the unpublished 'Shipwreck Inventory of Wrecks for Galway Bay'. These wrecks date to between 1750 and 1938; of them, 59 are from the 19th century. No records are currently known to exist for the period prior to the 18th century. Cargo throughout this period would usually be held in wooden casks varnished with fish oil for waterproofing.  Origins  The origins of the craft are not clear. A major spark in the revival of interest was the publication in 1983 of The Galway Hookers: Sailing work boats of Galway Bay (Richard J. Scott, d 24/01/08)‚Äînow in its fourth edition‚Äîin which for the first time detailed construction and sail plans were published.

Onoo's on-screen debut (billed as karate champion Kazuo Sonny Onoo) was in early 1995 at the Uncensored pay-per-view as a special referee in a Martial Arts match between Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Meng. A month later, he would be seen again as Kensuke Ishikawa, a member of the WCW International committee who voted for Ric Flair to be reinstated as a wrestler (Flair had lost a retirement match to Hulk Hogan at the 1994 Halloween Havoc). Onoo (referred to as Kazuo Ishikawa) also co-hosted the WCW presentation of Collision in Korea alongside Eric Bischoff and Mike Tenay. Later in 1995, Onoo became the on- screen manager Sonny Onoo, translating for a number of Japanese wrestlers who could not speak English. His signature look consisted of a stylish suit and small sunglasses. At Starrcade on December 27, 1995, Onoo led Team New Japan (Jushin Thunder Liger, Koji Kanemoto, Masahiro Chono, Masa Saito, Shinjiro Otani, Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Kensuke Sasaki) against Team WCW in a best-of- seven World Cup series. When Chono made a special appearance on WCW Monday Nitro in 1996, Chono immediately turned on him and became the first international member of the New World Order (nWo). Later, in 1997, Onoo brought in another New Japan star, The Great Muta, as a mystery opponent to get revenge on Chono. Like Chono, Muta immediately turned on Onoo, spitting his mist in Onoo's face before joining Chono in nWo Japan. During this time, Onoo also managed the √öltimo Drag√≥n. Thanks to his interference, Dragon defeated Dean Malenko to win the WCW Cruiserweight Championship at WCW's Starrcade pay-per-view in 1996. This win temporarily unified the title with the eight championships of the J-Crown. Dragon lost the J-Crown to Jushin Thunder Liger in Japan, while remaining WCW Cruiserweight Champion. He lost that title in a rematch with Malenko at WCW's Clash of the Champions XXXIV supercard, after botched interference by Onoo. Dragon then won the WCW Television Championship from Prince Iaukea on a Nitro in April and defended the title against former champion Steven Regal at Slamboree. Throughout the match, Onoo attempted to interfere on Dragon's behalf, but Dragon, preferring to win the match himself, admonished Onoo. Onoo then turned on Dragon, allowing Regal apply the Regal Stretch on Dragon to win back the title by submission. In August 1996, Onoo managed Bull Nakano in her feud with Madusa. At WCW's Hog Wild event, Madusa defeated Nakano in the match with the stipulation that she was then allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle. At this time, Onoo also managed Malia Hosaka. Onoo then managed Akira Hokuto who won the WCW Women's Championship over Madusa in the finals of the tournament to crown the first champion on December 29 at Starrcade in Nashville, Tennessee. On April 6, 1997, Hokuto retained the title against Madusa at Spring Stampede. The feud between Hokuto and Madusa culminated in a Title vs. Career match on June 15 at The Great American Bash won by Hokuto. Madusa was forced to \\"retire\\" due to a stipulation. This was the last time Hokuto ever appeared in WCW and the Women's Championship was apparently dropped, as it was never defended or mentioned again. Onoo also turned his attention to managing many of WCW's luchadores, taking both Psychosis and La Parka under his wing to feud with Dragon. Psychosis faced Dragon in a \\"Respect match\\" at the 1997 Great American Bash, losing by submission to the Dragon Sleeper. Later, when luchador Konnan joined the nWo, Onoo sent both Psychosis and La Parka after him in subsequent matches on Nitro, with both ending in defeat. Giving up on luchadores, Onoo managed WCW newcomer Yuji Nagata, to once again feud with Dragon. Nagata defeated Dragon by submission at Halloween Havoc and again by pinfall at World War 3, in a match where, had Dragon won, he would have five minutes in the ring alone with Onoo. Onoo parted ways with Nagata soon afterward. Onoo later became the manager of Ernest Miller and feuded with Perry Saturn, and later Jerry Flynn. Onoo's character spoke broken English and described himself as \\"money-hungry, deceitful, conniving, and violent.\\" During this time, he had a few matches, which he won. His character was originally depicted as an eccentric tourist who would take photographs of everyone he encountered. In general, their team was a reminiscence of the Jackie Chan's and Chris Tucker's characters from the film Rush Hour. After being released by WCW in November 1999 (Bischoff was by then no longer with the company), Onoo, Bobby Walker, Hardbody Harrison and several African American wrestlers launched a racial discrimination lawsuit against AOL Time Warner. In the lawsuit, Onoo claimed wrongful dismissal. Onoo also said that he had been given a disrespectful gimmick and that his final salary‚Äî$160,000‚Äîwas only half of the average pay for a wrestler at that time. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.

Its key signature has six sharps.

More common is notation in E-flat minor, which is a relatively manageable key for many brass instruments and woodwinds. The most famous work in this key is Scriabin's Etude Op. 8, No. 12. From Bach's Das Wohltemperierte Klavier, the eighth fugue from Book 1 and the eighth prelude and fugue from Book 2 are in D-sharp minor; both fugues end with a Picardy third, requiring an F in the final D-sharp major chord. The second movement from Charles-Valentin Alkan's Grande sonate 'Les quatre √¢ges', subtitled Quasi-Faust, is also in D-sharp minor (but ends in F-sharp major), and modulates into even sharper keys along the way, some even being theoretical keys, such as G-sharp major and E-sharp major. In a few scores, 6-sharp key signatures in the bass clef are written with the sharp for the A on the top line. Despite the key rarely being used in orchestral music other than to modulate, it is not entirely uncommon in keyboard music. For orchestration of piano music, some theorists recommend transposing the music to D minor or E minor. If D-sharp minor must absolutely be used, one should take care that B wind instruments be notated in F minor, rather than E-sharp minor (or G instruments used instead, giving a transposed key of G-sharp minor), and D instruments in D minor instead of C minor, in order to avoid double sharps in key signatures. Meanwhile, the E horns would have parts written with a B minor key signature.

Plot Mark Conrad, a debonair Anglo-Austrian former playboy and junk owner, now an alcoholic down-and-out, is expelled from Hong Kong. He is placed on an ancient ferry boat, the Fa Tsan (known to its crew as the Fat Annie), despite the protests of the pompous owner, Captain Cecil Hart. He travels to Macau, but is refused entry for the same reason he was expelled from Hong Kong. He engages the captain in a card game and wins the right to 'live' on board. His charming manner endears him to the crew and to an attractive teacher Liz Ferrers, a regular passenger. The ferry is nearly wrecked in a typhoon, but Conrad wrests command from the cowardly and drunken captain and saves the ship. Drifting out of control near the Chinese coast, they are boarded by pirates, led by Chinese-American Johnny Sing-up. Sing-up reveals that Hart is a former conman who won the ship in a crooked card-game. Conrad becomes a hero when he saves the ship, and is allowed to stay in Hong Kong. He is tempted to continue his budding relationship with Liz, but decides to resist it until he has 'beaten the dragon'.

Rank had rationalised its film production arm, decreasing overall output but putting more money in a certain number of films. Rank chairman John Davis said: \\"It is vital that the greatest possible financial encouragement should be given to the making of important films: for these the public will gladly pay. The emphasis will be on the more expensive and important film.\\"\\"BRITISH DOSSIER: Rank Theatre Chain, Production List Reduced -- Outlet -- Other Items\\" by STEPHEN WATTS LONDON..

Orson Welles, he said, \\"never cared about his fellow actors, never cared about the director\\". Gilbert says \\"everything was wrong with the film - principally Orson Welles\\".Lewis Gilbert's comments were made in an interview on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs transmitted on 25 June 2010. Originally Jurgens was meant to play the ship captain and Welles the tramp but John Davis, head of Rank, insisted they change roles. The film was shot entirely on location. In Hong Kong the production team bought a boat that could be converted into a paddle steamer and used local labour to build a full sized studio stage and crane for the CinemaScope camera. The film was shot with guide tracks and every line of dialogue was re-recorded and re-synched in Pinewood. Welles and Jurgens hated each other and Gilbert had trouble filming them in the same shot. Welles insisted on wearing a false nose and at one point held up filming for two days while he could find his nose.

Early life, education, and family Barton is a lifelong resident of Aledo, Texas, a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. He graduated from Aledo High School in 1972. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in religious education from Oral Roberts University in 1976. Barton is married and has three grown children, including a daughter who performs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Texas. He has lived in Aledo, Texas, since his childhood; Aledo is also the site of the WallBuilders Library.  Career  After graduating from college, Barton served as a youth pastor at churches in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was employed as a teacher of math and science and eventually became principal at Aledo Christian School, a ministry of the charismatic church started by Barton's parents. In 1987, Barton formed Specialty Research Associates, Inc., a company which said it focused on historical research of \\"relating to America's constitutional, moral, and religious heritage.\\" Specialty Research Associates submitted amicus curiae briefs in court cases.The Turnaround in Education, David Barton, Oral Roberts University In 1988, the company became WallBuilders. Barton is the founder and president of the Aledo-based group WallBuilders. WallBuilders publishes and sells most of Barton's books and videos, some of which present Barton's position that the modern view of separation of church and state is not consistent with the views of the Founders. Barton has argued that the religion clauses of the First Amendment were intended only for monotheistic religions, and perhaps solely Christianity. A 2005 Time magazine article entitled \\"The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals\\" called Barton \\"a major voice in the debate over church‚Äìstate separation\\" who, despite the fact that \\"many historians dismiss his thinking... [is] a hero to millions--including some powerful politicians.\\" Barton has appeared on television and radio programs, including those of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and Glenn Beck.

In September 2013, he returned to the political arena and advised state legislators on how to fight the Common Core academic standards promoted by the Obama administration. Barton was from 1997 to 2006 the vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party under state chairman Susan Weddington. He has also acted as a political consultant to the Republican National Committee on outreach to evangelicals.The Dobson way , Dan Gilgoff, U.S. News & World Report, 1/9/05 There was a Tea Party movement to get him to run against Senator John Cornyn in the 2014 Senate election from Texas.

Saint Kitts Creole does not have the status of an official language. Saint Kitts Creole has much the same history as other English Caribbean creoles. Its origin lies in 17th-century enslaved West Africans, who, when brought to the islands to work on sugar plantations, were forced to learn British English quickly because their labour required it. Their English was mixed with West African words and, in some cases, West African language structure. The French, who occupied the island from 1625 to 1713, had only a small impact on the creole spoken today, unlike in the formerly French islands of Dominica and Saint Lucia, which speak a French-based rather than English-based creole. Saint Kitts Creole today is spoken on the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis (although Nevisians refer to the language as \\"Nevisian\\" or \\"Nevis creole\\"), mainly in rural areas, and is spoken especially heavily in Capesterre, Christ Church Nichola Town, Cayon, and Nevis. Today's use of the creole involves a higher proportion of Standard English, possibly due to access to foreign media. Usually, only residents in rural areas and Nevis are strong creole users, although mesolectal forms of the language are employed by the majority of the population. Popular Jamaican culture and music have also played a role, as Jamaican idioms are being used more and more in the Saint Kitts creole, as well as throughout the region. Saint Kitts pronunciation is similar to the pronunciation on the neighbouring islands of Antigua and Montserrat, but with slight differences that are mostly noticeable only to residents of the Leeward Islands. Pronunciation Saint Kitts Creole is pronounced similarly to the creoles of neighbouring islands, namely Antigua and Montserrat. Usually only longtime residents in the islands can mark the slight differences. In rural areas and in Nevis, (as in \\"house\\") is usually pronounced (as in \\"hose\\"). Grammar In Saint Kitts Creole, words are rarely pluralized by adding an ending to the word. The word is usually followed by the word dem to indicate the pluralization. e.g. - \\"the girls\\". Note that if the Standard English form of the word is not pluralized with an \\"s\\", e.g. \\"children\\", the plural form of the word in Saint Kitts creole will be the Standard English plural form followed by dem, e.g. . Questions ending in \\"is it?\\" have the \\"is it\\" replaced with y be (i bee); e.g. Who is it? - Who y be? What is it? - Wha y be? Words used to intensify adjectives, such as \\"very\\" and \\"extremely\\", are rarely used. Instead, the adjective in question is repeated; for example: De gyul look bad bad - \\"The girl looks very ugly.\\" Alternatively, the phrase \\"so tail\\" is placed after the adjective to indicate a strong emphasis or intensification; for example: De gyul look bad so tail - \\"The girl looks extremely ugly.\\" A unique aspect of Saint Kitts Creole is to end certain sentences in the speech with the words burdee, poopa or daady buh, the meaning of which vary with context but tend to be used to emphasise the sentence they attach to; for example: Tall poopa - \\"not at all\\" (extreme). Hush buhdee - \\"hush buddy\\" (used when extremely annoyed). The word \\"does\\" is often traditionally inserted where it would not appear in Standard English sentence structure.

History Allacapan has its beginning as a small village in the jungle vastness, inhabited by Negritoes, also known as Aetas. Ilocanos mainly from Ilocos Sur, among them future town mayor Santos Martinez, discovered it in quest for better land and eventually dominated the area. Allacapan was founded as a municipal district of Tawit, Mountain Province, in 1926. It was ceded to Cagayan in 1928, and finally became a regular municipality in 1945 by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 590 authored by Congressman Miguel Pio. The history of Allacapan has a series of existing episodes and transitions. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese forces established a garrison in the heart of the community from where echoed moans of torture inflicted upon prisoners of war, most often, innocent civilians. Later on, the Japanese burned the municipal hall, including the school building in the old site of Daan-Ili. The incident aggravated the fear of the civilians and they fled to the mountains. After liberation, disgruntled ex-Army men who were not satisfied with their backpay checks took to the hills with their rifles and joined the underground movement. Allacapan then became a hotbed of the Huks (HUKBALAHAP or Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon). Their atrocities resulted in the kidnapping of then Mayor Agustin Gorospe in September 1951, the burning of the newly constructed town hall, and the looting of the local treasury. The construction of the highway from Magapit, Lallo to Bangag, Aparri traversing Allacapan and the opening of the Magapit Bridge to traffic, facilitated mobility of trade and commerce. Allacapan suddenly became a local point. It is now accessible from all points and is fast becoming an urban community. The municipality's name came to be when Francisco Umengan, an ex-municipal president from Aparri, was annoyed by the skittering of dried leaves heaped within the vicinity. On his inquiry about the significance of the noise, his Negrito guide told him \\"alla- appan\\" meaning \\"trap.\\" Umengan then named the place \\"Allacapan\\" and the name has remained to the present.

Adolphus was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at St. John's College, Oxford. In 1821 he published \\"Letters to Richard Heber, Esq.\\", in which he discussed the authorship of the then anonymous Waverley novels, and fixed it upon Sir Walter Scott. This conclusion was based on the resemblance of the novels in general style and method to the poems acknowledged by Scott. Scott thought at first that the letters were written by Reginald Heber, afterwards bishop of Calcutta, and the discovery of J. L. Adolphus's identity led to a warm friendship. Adolphus was called to the bar in 1822, and his Circuiteers, an Eclogue, is a parody of the style of two of his colleagues on the Northern Circuit.

History The town was named after the \\"malaniug\\" trees which grew in abundance during the early years. Camalaniugan was founded on June 15, 1596, a rather early date because of its proximity to Nueva Segovia (Lallo). San Jacinto de Polonia was selected as their patron saint. The early settlers were the Ybanags and Ilocanos, both peace-loving citizens. They built their houses along the banks of the Cagayan River. They brought with them their knowledge of farming and skills in making weapons. According to the story related by the elders, among these \\"happy\\" settlers was Guiab, a famous strongman and leader of Camalaniugan. He did not like the missionaries. Because of this, he was arrested and later hanged from a malaniug tree by order of Juan Pablo Carreon. For years the people suffered injustice. Between the year 1887-1888, Fray Marcelino Cascos, O.P., built a convent. It was in this convent where Col. Daniel Tirona billeted his men after arresting the missionaries when he occupied the town in 1898. It is in this town where the oldest Christian bell in the Far East is located. It is also the birthplace of Don Vicente Nepomuceno, author of the history book \\"Historia Nac Cagayan\\" which is written in Ybanag. The town has a church dedicated to San Jacinto or Saint Hyacinth which houses the oldest church bell (Sancta Maria, 1595) in the far east.

The municipality was named after Spanish governor-general Pasqual Enrile y Alcedo. Cabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime. Enrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta. Maria, Isabela to the south, by the mighty Cagayan River to the east, by Solana and Tuguegarao to the north, Kalinga to the west. Enrile is predominantly an agricultural town where the majority of its population derive their income from farming. It has a land area of 18,450 hectares unevenly distributed to the 22-barangays of the municipality. Its main products are rice, corn, peanut, tobacco and vegetables. Enrile has a total population of 35,834 inhabitants. Its citizens are called Itawit because they speak the Itawit dialect. Ilocanos and Tagalogs have settled at the western barangays and have blended very well in the mainstream of Itawit life. Enrile is a community of simple and hardworking people. While Enrile has limited natural resources, it takes pride in its human resources. Almost every family in the community has a member that is of the professional class. Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province.  History  The History of Enrile dates as early as 1690. According to Father Juan Paguere, it was just a wide and long stretch of virgin land located at the southernmost end of the province of Cagayan. In 1718, the Govierno Superior ordered the place to become one of the barrios of Tuguegarao. It was named \\"Cabugag\\" or in short Cabug, the dialect term for hunchback for the first settler was a man with this deformity. So the place was named after him. The name \\"Cabug\\" is engraved on the town's first church bell which is still found in the steeple. In 1724, The Dominican Friars have thought of giving the barrios their Patron Saint. Cabug was given \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de las Caldas\\". The old prominent residents of the barrio had chosen the sixth day of August as her feast day. As year went by, the land area and population of the barrio increased with surprising rapidly. The Cagayan River which flowed close to the barrio site gradually changed its course and moved further towards Cataggaman as flood plains were formed. The non Christian inhabitants called Kalingas gradually deserted the barrio and moved westward to the Mountain Province. As a result, more agricultural lands were cleared and cultivated. Tobacco and corn are the chief crops of the people. In September 1849, the Govierno Superior ordered the separation of Cabug from the municipality of Tuguegarao to become a town by itself. The new town was named Enrile in honor of Governor Pascual Enrile who was responsible for building roads in the northern part of Luzon during those days. The separation of Enrile from Tuguegarao led to a change of its patron saint. The population unanimously adopted \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves\\" as its patron Saint. The fifth day of August was selected as her feast day. Since then the feast day had always been celebrated pompously. According to Father Julian Malumbres in his Historia de Cagayan, the name \\"Cabug\\" was first recorded in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers on January 20, 1849. However the town was known as \\"Cabug\\" even up 1863 when the name Enrile was officially written and road in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers. Cabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.

Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province. In 1690, the town of Enrile was a virgin forest on the southernmost portion of the province of Cagayan. In 1724 or thereabouts, it was named Cabug, a barrio of Tuguegarao City and it now celebrates its feast day on August 6, later changed to August 5, in honor of its Patron Saint Nuestra Seno≈ïa de las Caldas. In the chronicle of Fray Julian Manumbres, Cabug as a geographical unit was officially recorded on January 20, 1849. And although the name Enrile was officially written and read in the records of the Dominicans up to 1863, the town of Enrile was still known as \\"Cabug\\". Kalingas, the early settlers, were later joined by neighbor inhabitants in the cleaning and cultivating its rich soil. They plowed and planted the fields with staple products and tobacco. With the increasing production and number of educated elders, the Gobierno Superior proclaimed \\"Cabug\\" separated from Tuguegarao City in 1849, with a new patroness named Nuestra Seno≈ïa de las Nieves. This proclaimed \\"Cabug\\" as \\"Enrile\\" in honor of Gobernardo General Pascual Enrile, who was responsible for the construction of Luzon's highways. Sinupac, a hinterland of Enrile, was the hiding place of Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary forces when they retreated from pursuing American forces. Today the town of Enrile not only boasts of its peaceful,orderly conditions and its competent professionals, but also of its rapidly growing hog and poultry industry.

Peanut Production  Pamilihang Bayan ng Enrile The Department of Agriculture (DA) has declared the town of Enrile in Cagayan as the \\"peanut capital of the Philippines\\" for its \\"noteworthy contribution\\" to the development of the local peanut industry. Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala declared it so following the presentation of evidence of the significant contributions of the town to the peanut industry in the country. DA Assistant Secretary for Agribusiness Leandro Gazmin, who went to Enrile to represent Alcala during the peanut harvest ceremony, said the soil suitability of the town ‚Äì sandy to sandy-loam ‚Äì and its unique ability to produce peanut year-round are the \\"primary reasons why it will be known as an important source of peanut henceforth.\\" Gazmin said the Secretary lauds them for their collective effort but that the DA chief requests that they \\"commit themselves to improve and develop even further not just the peanut industry but the entire agricultural sector as well.\\" He said the Secretary is also happy to know that farmers have been receptive to new technologies hence, they are able to increase productivity from 1.5 to 1.8 tons per hectare. During the peanut harvest, the DA regional office turned over to the local government of Enrile over P4-million worth of farm machineries and equipment, including one unit four-wheel drive tractor, four units of mill for corngrits, 10 heads of carabao, 2,500 kilos of peanut seeds for planting and 300 bags of open-pollinated corn variety. Though peanut is considered a high value crop by DA, not just in Enrile but in neighboring towns of Pe√±ablanca and Tuguegarao (Cagayan) and Sta. Maria and Cabagan in Isabela, the former was chosen as \\"number one\\" for having the \\"highest production share of 1,800 metric tons per year or 8 to10 percent of the national supply.\\" Also, Enrile is the only municipality that can cultivate peanuts during the dry and wet season cropping, the DA said. DA Region II Executive Director Lucrecio Alviar said that per cropping, the town of Enrile is able to produce a big chunk of the national production, making it the major source of raw materials for various peanut-based products processed and sold in Metro Manila. Enrile is home to 800 peanut farmers cultivating 700 hectares of farmlands with a potential expansion area of another 800 hectares. \\"With improved production and yield, Enrile may be able to fill up a portion, if not all, of the import requirement for peanut of 15,060 metric tons,\\" Alviar added. With the use of technology from DA and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) ‚Äì particularly the use of improved varieties and fertilizers like Boron and Gypsum ‚Äì the DA is optimistic that \\"peanut production could reach an all-time high of 3.25 tons per hectare,\\" or an increase of 200 percent over its current average. The DA said it hopes the farmers can sustain their productivity. Gazmin also encouraged peanut farmers to bring their harvest to the Isabela Agri-Pinoy Trading Center, where they can directly sell their produce. The Isabela APTC is part of the government's effort to empower farmers to become traders to enhance their incomes, stabilize food prices and encourage them to produce more. \\"Let us utilize the center as a venue for cooperativism\\" and enabling each other to produce and earn more, he said.  Transportation  Passenger jeepneys, tricycles and other private transportation vehicles service all routes within and outside Enrile. Kalesa is also driven within the Poblacion and barangays only.

According to the , it has a population of people. Gattaran's historic spots and tourist landmarks include the Lal-lo and Gattaran Shell Middens, Magapit Protected Landscape, Maduppaper Caves, the Mapaso Hot Spring and the Tanglagan Falls whose warm and cold waters meet and flow together on one bed to become the Dummun River. Another attraction of Gattaran is Bolos Point, a wildlife sanctuary. History In the place where Gattaran lies today were three former ecclesiastical towns: Nassiping, Dummun, and Gattaran proper. Nassiping is the oldest among the three, founded on June 15, 1596 with Santa Catalina as the patron saint; Dummun was founded on May 24, 1598 and Gattaran, May 20, 1623. Since each of these towns had few inhabitants and had only one priest to administer to their religious needs, they were merged for ecclesiastical convenience into one municipality in 1877 by virtue of a Diocesan Order from the Bishop of Nueva Segovia (Lallo). Fray Francisco Suejos, O.P. was the first Gobernadorcillo. During the Spanish regime, the natives grew spiritually; but with the Americans, they grew educationally and the inhabitants assimilated a more sophisticated lifestyle. Under the Commonwealth Government, the first Municipal Mayor was Melencio Adviento, who begun the construction of the present municipal building. The building was finished during the term of the next mayor, Atty. Hipolito Mandac. The municipal building was inaugurated in September, 1941. Four months after its inauguration, World War II broke out, the Japanese Forces occupied the town and all records, cadastral titles and others were confiscated by the invading forces. With the coming of the Americans to adding Filipino soldiers under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary, the whole province was liberated from the Japanese forces. The first election of the Republic in 1947 made Delfino Liban the mayor. The administration marked the building of roads in the barrios, improvements of streets and others. In 1950, the barrios of Gattaran to the west of the Cagayan River was separated to form the town of Lasam. In the classical era, Gattaran used to be the home of hunter-gatherers who specialized in hunting mollusks. These hunter-gatherers have stockpiled their leftover mollusk shells in numerous sites in Gattaran and neighboring Lal-lo, until eventually, the shells formed into largest stock of shell-midden sites in the entire Philippines. In 2006, the shell-midden sites of Gattaran and Lal-lo were included in the UNESCO Tentative List for World Heritage Site inclusion, a step closer to becoming a world heritage site. The shell-midden sites are currently being conserved by the local government from looting to preserve its outstanding universal value. Barangays Gattaran is politically subdivided into 50 barangays.

Biography At the age of 8, Pickett moved with his father, William R. Pickett to the frontier of Autauga County, ceded to the United States by the Creek Indians in the Treaty of Fort Jackson only four years earlier. William Pickett built a home near Autaugaville and a mill building and trader's post on Swift Creek. Growing up, Albert befriended many of the Creek and frontier traders that frequented his father's store. From them he began to piece together the early history of the state which he later put into writing. Pickett studied law, but never practiced professionally, instead devoting his time to literature, agriculture, and historical research. He traveled widely and corresponded with archivists and book dealers in the Atlantic states and Europe in order to document various parts of his history of the state. The two-volume History of Alabama was published in Charleston, South Carolina in 1851. Pickett was working on a comprehensive history of the Southwest at the time of his death. History of Alabama His History of Alabama and Incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi from the Earliest Period was published in 1851, with the copyright renewed in 1878 by Mrs. Sarah S. Pickett.

It was the fourth full- length feature film to be based on the Peanuts comic strip. Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz wrote that he came up with the idea for the story while visiting the Ch√¢teau Malvoisin, where he was stationed briefly as a soldier during World War II. The castle plays a large role in the film. The movie uses the same voice cast that worked on the 1977 Peanuts television special It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown, the 1979 Peanuts television special You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown, and the 1980 Peanuts television special She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown. This film contains a rare occurrence where the adults appear on screen, including having their faces entirely visible, as well as speaking comprehensible lines. Paramount Home Entertainment released this film on VHS and Laserdisc in 1995 in 4:3 format, and released it to DVD (cropped to widescreen) on October 6, 2015. This film came three years after Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown and would be the last traditionally animated Peanuts film from the Bill Melendez studio. The characters would not return to film until 2015's computer-animated The Peanuts Movie. Three years after the film's release, a 1983 television special, What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?, continues the story, bringing the Peanuts gang to memorials and places related to World Wars I and II. Plot At Charlie Brown's school, Linus Van Pelt introduces to his class two French students, Babette and Jacques, who will be spending two weeks there in order to get accustomed to the United States. In exchange, Charlie Brown and Linus are chosen to go to France. Charlie Brown heads home and invites Snoopy and Woodstock to go with him. He gets a call from Peppermint Patty, who tells him that she and Marcie were also chosen to go to France as a student exchange. Charlie Brown also gets a letter from France, but cannot read it because it is written in French. He is not very positive about the trip because of the letter he got. Marcie, who has been studying French, translates it. The letter says that Charlie Brown has been invited to stay at a fictional French chateau, the Ch√¢teau du Mal Voisin (House of the Bad Neighbor). They arrive first in London, where Snoopy leaves the group temporarily to play tennis at Wimbledon, where the beagle gets in a dispute with the referee for a judgment call about the ball being in or out. He loses his temper, causing him to be banned from the grounds. When they arrive across the English Channel in France via the hovercraft, they pick up a Citro√´n 2CV, which must be driven by Snoopy as none of the others have a drivers' licence, though Snoopy enjoys grinding the gears out of it. Upon their arrival, the four go to their respective homes. Patty and Marcie go to stay at a farm, where they meet a boy named Pierre, who immediately attracts their attention. It is obvious that Marcie and Pierre have a spark between them - obvious to everyone except Patty, who manages to convince herself that Pierre likes her. Meanwhile, Charlie Brown, Linus, Snoopy, and Woodstock go to the chateau, which they find is apparently abandoned, though somebody keeps leaving food for them and making their beds after they leave for school. In reality, the chateau is owned by an unfriendly baron, and the person leaving Charlie Brown and Linus food is the baron's kindly niece, Violette Honfleur. Linus goes inside the chateau to investigate and tracks Violette down and demand what is going on. Violette says that although her uncle is irritable, she must remember what a U.S. Army soldier had done for her family by helping them out during World War I. Violette shows Linus a picture of the soldier, and he comments that the soldier looks like Charlie Brown and it is revealed that the soldier is actually Charlie Brown's grandfather, Silas Brown. The baron returns home and Violette tries to hide Linus, but she accidentally drops a candle, engulfing a fire in the chateau's attic. Charlie Brown runs to get Peppermint Patty and Marcie and Pierre calls the fire department, while Snoopy and Woodstock get a old fashioned fire hose from a shed. Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, and Pierre rescue Linus and Violette and Snoopy uses the hose to keep the fire under control until the fire department finally arrives to help. Thankful for the chateau's rescue, the baron has a change of heart and allows the gang inside, and Charlie Brown learns the truth behind the mysterious letter he received from Violette, and he, Snoopy, Linus, Patty, and Marcie leave their new friends to see more of the French countryside, and eventually return home to the United States as the film comes to an end.

It was named after the former Kingdom of Kaffa. The etymology of Kaffa is thought to be from the Arabic qahwah meaning \\"a drink from berries\\".Wilhelm Sturmfels and Heinz Bischof: Unsere Ortsnamen im ABC erkl√§rt nach Herkunft und Bedeutung, Bonn, 1961, Ferdinand D√ºmmlers Verlag The English word coffee is derived from the same root. Kaffa was bordered on the west by Sudan, on the northwest by Illubabor, on the north by Walega, on the northeast by Shewa, on the east by Sidamo, and on the southeast by Gamu-Gofa. For the former province, see Keffa Province. Keffa is a Zone in the Ethiopian Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR). Keffa is bordered on the south by Debub Omo, on the southwest by Bench Maji, on the west by Sheka, on the north by the Oromia Region, and on the east by Konta. Gojeb River runs along part of the northern border of this zone. The administrative center of Keffa is Bonga. Keffa formed the main part of former Keficho Shekicho Zone. Demographics Based on the 2017 Census conducted by the CSA, this Zone has a total population of 2,100,000, of whom 1,317,078 are men and 783,022women; 152,036 or 9.44% are urban inhabitants. The four largest ethnic groups reported in this Zone were the Kafficho (82.72%), the Bench (5.05%), the Amhara (3.67%), and the Oromo (3.5%); all other ethnic groups made up 5.09% of the population. Kafa is spoken as a first language by 82.49%, 4.18% speak Amharic, 5.13% Bench, and 3.43% speak Oromiffa; the remaining 4.77% spoke all other primary languages reported. 61.42% of the population said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 24.84% were Protestants, 6.2% were Muslim, 5.37% practiced traditional beliefs, and 1.73% embraced Catholicism.[1] Economy and environment Southern Ethiopia, including Sidamo, Kaffa, Arsi and Harar is the original home of coffee Halevy Alon, Halevy Oriana (2011) \\"The Infinite Emotions of Coffee\\" pp. 32 \\"the Arabica coffee tree originated from Southwestern Ethiopia\\". which grows wild here in the mountain rain forests in countless varieties. All plants of the species Coffea arabica around the world are descendants of plants from southern Ethiopia.Halevy Alon, Halevy Oriana (2011) \\"The Infinite Emotions of Coffee\\" pp. 32 \\"the Arabica coffee tree originated from Southwestern Ethiopia\\". Coffee has long been the main source of income, but due to the sharply declining world prices for coffee, the residents increasingly have to grow other crops. By turning rain forests into new agricultural land, the structure of the region is heavily damaged. The rain forests that dominated the region of Kaffa earlier are reduced to only 3% of their original size, in the last 30 years 60% of the trees were lost. For some years there is a large rain forest conservation project, which relies on the use of the last wild stocks of coffee growing in the rain forest. Currently, some 30 cooperatives are harvesting and marketing this specialty coffee and have helped over 40,000 people to get income. In 2010, an area within the Kaffa province was recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve as part of the Man and the Biosphere Programme.

The plant is called lobeira (\\"wolf's plant\\") or fruta-do- lobo (\\"wolf's fruit\\") in Portuguese. The name \\"wolf apple\\" comes from the fact that they account for more than 50% of the Maned wolf's diet. Likewise, the scientific name \\"lycocarpum\\" is formed from Latinized Greek elements \\"lyco-\\", meaning \\"wolf\\", and \\"carpum\\" meaning \\"fruit\\". Range The native range of the wolf apple tree is the Brazilian savannah, but it grows also on pastures and disturbed land, such as highway margins, in various parts of Brazil. It prefers moist, clay soil, full sun, and mild temperatures. Description Flower Fruit The wolf apple plant is a flowering shrub or small tree with round open crown, ranging in height from 1.2 to 5 m. The leaves are large (16 to 28 cm long), simple but deeply lobed, tough, and covered in a soft grey-white fuzz, in alternate disposition. Plants flower through the year, but more intensely during the dry season, from late fall to early spring. The flowers are similar to those of the bitter nightshade: star- shaped, with five sepals, five blue or purple petals fused at the base, and five large yellow anthers that release pollen through an opening at the tip. The flowers are arranged in helical monochasal cyme, opening from the base up. Flowers lack nectar, and are either male or hermaphroditic. The latter produce fruit after cross-pollination by several species of pollen-collecting bees, including Xylocopa virescens, X. frontalis, Oxaea flavescens, Centris scopipes, C. fuscata, Bombus morio, Exomalopsis sp., Pseudaugochloropsis graminea, Apis mellifera, and Megachile benigna. Fruit production occurs mostly between December and January. The fruits are large, up to 20 cm in diameter and weighing up to over 900 g, and contain up to 500 dark brown comma-shaped seeds, about 7 √ó 5 √ó 2 mm. The rind is thin and lustrous, and remains green even after ripening. The pulp is yellowish, soft, sweetish and extremely aromatic. They resemble the tomato in external shape and internal morphology, but also the eggplant for the texture and color of the flesh. The maned wolf is an important seed-spreading agent. Uses =Food= The ripe fruits are edible to humans, and are consumed by local populations in jams and preserves, but the unripe fruits are quite rich in tannin. The fruits are used as a fallback source of food for cattle in the dry season. At the onset of maturation, the whole fruit contains 85% moisture (by weight), 5% starch, and 10% other residue. The dry pulp, without peel and seeds, yields over 50% starch, more than cassava. The starch is locally separated by blending the fruit with water and straining. The pulp of the ripe fruit contains about 75% moisture, 11% carbohydrate, 1% fat, 1% protein, 1% ash, 2.5% soluble fiber, and 2% insoluble fiber. The main volatiles in the ripe fruit are hexanal (which has the scent of grass) and ethyl butanoate (scent of apple), although dozens of other compounds contribute to the fruit's aroma. All other parts of the plant are poisonous to humans. However, the leaves are eaten by cattle, and are also an important food source for the bat Platyrrhinus lineatus. =Medicine= Currently, there are no proven medicinal uses for the wolf apple, but the plant is used in the local folk medicine for obesity, cholesterol reduction, and as a treatment for diabetes. About 30% of the starch extracted from almost-ripe fruits, which commercialized as capsules, is digestion-resistant, which seems to be the rationale for these popular uses. High-fiber Solanum lycocarpum flour was found to reduce diabetes symptoms in diabetic rats; however, the starch did not show such effect. The fruit contains about 1.5% of glycoalkaloids in its dried fruits, chiefly solamargine and solasonine, mostly in the peel and seeds. Extracts have been shown to kill in vitro the human parasites Schistosoma mansoni and Giardia lamblia, Leishmania amazonensis, and Leishmania infantum. The main phenolic compounds in ethanol extracts of the ripe fruits are caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid. It is believed that the fruits protect the maned wolf from infection of the giant kidney worm, which is usually fatal for the animal. Solanum lycocarpum fruit extracts have also been shown to kill larvae of the Culex mosquito. Pests The wolf apple tree is the natural host of the larva of the butterfly Leucanella memusae. Contact with the urticating bristles of this caterpillar may result in severe dermatitis and hemorrhage. The weevil Collabismus clitellae lays eggs into stems of the plant, causing the formation of galls, with measurable harmful effect on the plant's growth and fruit production.

It is the longest-running documentary in its genre on British television, with nearly 500 episodes broadcast since its inception in 1983. Natural World programmes are typically one-off films that take an in-depth look at particular natural history events, stories or subjects from around the globe. Natural World is produced by the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol under the stewardship of the Series Editor, who is responsible for commissioning or acquiring content. Programmes are a mixture of in-house productions, collaborative productions with other broadcasters or acquisitions from independent producers. There are 10 programmes broadcast each year, of which approximately half are produced in-house. The series has close ties with the US series Nature, broadcast by PBS. History Natural World was initiated in 1983 as a wildlife-specific spin-off to The World About Us, itself a long-running documentary strand on BBC Two. The World About Us was commissioned in 1967 by David Attenborough, at that time the Controller of BBC Two, to promote the new colour television service to British audiences. As the former head of the BBC's Travel and Exploration Unit in London, Attenborough realised that many of its telecine films had been shot in colour and would make ideal subjects for a documentary series, along with natural history content from the Bristol Unit and overseas broadcasters. The World About Us launched on 3 December 1967 to coincide with the first full evening of colour television in Britain, with Attenborough himself acting as Series Editor. The first programme was \\"Volcano\\", a film by the French vulcanologist Haroun Tazieff; the Natural History Unit's first contribution was \\"Forest and Firebird\\" featuring the brilliantly-coloured scarlet ibis. Programmes such as these were no accident: The World About Us was described by Barry Paine, a frequent producer and narrator during its first two decades, as \\"a series designed to sell colour television sets\\". Due to the difficulty of sourcing colour films at the time, The World About Us started out with a broad remit of geography, anthropology and natural history as subject matter. Gradually, the contributions from the Travel and Exploration Unit diminished and the Natural History Unit's programmes grew in prominence. This was acknowledged by the BBC when the series was re-launched as The Natural World in 1983; the title subsequently shortened to its current form in 2003. The first episode under the new title was \\"Save the Panda\\", broadcast on 30 October 1983 in what would become a regular time slot on Sunday evenings (where Series Editor Peter Jones claimed audiences were \\"hungry for natural history\\"). The World About Us continued until 1986. The early Series Editors benefited from a generous budget, courtesy of a co-production partnership with the US broadcaster WNET. The American channel was keen to commission material for its recently launched Nature strand on PBS. The first programme to benefit from the partnership was the 1982 mini-series The Flight of the Condor. At the same time, researchers and field biologists were publishing many new discoveries about wildlife in scientific journals, providing the BBC with plentiful material for new programme ideas. As a result, the strand quickly expanded from 10 to 20 slots by 1985 and a number of special programmes were commissioned, helped by additional funding from BBC Enterprises (now BBC Worldwide). Among them were the award-winning mini-series Kingdom of the Ice Bear (1985) and Vanishing Earth (1986). David Attenborough has maintained a close association with Natural World throughout its long history, narrating or presenting around 50 episodes to date. In 2008, on the strand's 25th anniversary, he commented \\"I have no doubt that Natural World is not only the doyen and founding member of the 50-minute natural history genre but is still the one with the best and most distinguished record.\\" In recent years, the number of Natural World programmes has reduced to 10 per series, and the strand no longer occupies a regular place in BBC Two's schedule. High-definition broadcasts of Natural World programmes started in 2008 on the BBC HD channel and following its closure are now simulcast on BBC Two HD. Format, content and notable episodes The World About Us helped to popularize the long-form documentary on British television thanks to its generous 50-minute length, a step up from the half-hour programmes which were more common at the time. Filmmakers were able to take advantage of this format to delve into a particular story in more detail, or cover broader themes. More recently, the running time has been extended to 60 minutes. The tone of the strand was set by its first Series Editor, Peter Jones, who gave his film-makers the time and budget to explore their subjects in more detail. He also decided to avoid a house style in favour of a flexible approach where the style was chosen to match the subject of the documentary. This freedom from stylistic constraints gave film-makers autonomy to make the programmes they wanted. As Natural World quickly established itself in the schedules, the Series Editors were able to take risks with unusual subjects which may otherwise have been avoided by broadcasters. According to Jones, \\"the idea was to give the audience a surprise each week. It was as far from the contemporary concept of formatted television as you could get.\\" Some of the more unusual subjects have included plankton, wasps, cephalopods and manure (\\"The Wonderful World of Dung\\", 1991). Jones's successors have maintained the same ethos, mixing traditional \\"blue- chip\\" natural history with different approaches to storytelling. Mike Gunton, Series Editor from 2001-2004, introduced more human elements into the programmes, granted filmmakers additional time in the field to get the shots they needed and continued to experiment with style. \\"Cats Under Serengeti Stars\\" was filmed entirely in black and white and \\"Dune\\" was told from the point of view of a grain of sand. In its current guise, Natural World programmes typically fall into three categories: strong, emotional stories; popular or unusual but interesting animal subjects; and films offering a different, personal perspective. Filmmakers are granted up to 100 days in the field, depending on how much archive material can be used. David Attenborough's notable episodes include the Echo of the Elephants films, which followed scientist Cynthia Moss and cameraman Martyn Colbeck on their lengthy study of an elephant herd in Kenya. In \\"Attenborough in Paradise\\" (1996), he fulfilled a lifelong ambition to observe and film the courtship displays of birds of paradise, whilst \\"The Amber Time Machine\\" (2004) saw him trace the origins of a piece of amber from the time of the dinosaurs. For \\"Attenborough's Ark\\", a 2012 special, he selected his 10 personal favourite species to save on an imaginary ark. The programme drew 3.2 million viewers, the strand's highest audience for eight years. Natural World's most-watched episode also featured Attenborough, this time as the narrator of \\"Highgrove, A Prince's Legacy\\" (2003). 4.8 million viewers watched Prince Charles explain the organic farming methods used on his Highgrove House estate. For many years, the series regularly included documentaries on British wildlife, but the commissioning editors no longer consider such programmes. The last programme with a British theme was \\"An Unnatural History of London\\" in 2012, which featured the capital's urban wildlife. Another programme set in Britain, 2003's \\"My Halcyon River\\", became the most requested repeat by readers of Radio Times in the days following its transmission. Awards Natural World programmes are regularly nominated at television industry awards and wildlife film festivals. Notable award-winners from the early years of the series include the 1986 Prix Italia for Vanishing Earth and an Emmy for cinematography for Kingdom of the Ice Bear. The Royal Television Society awarded Natural World the Best Documentary Strand in 1999 and photography prizes to the episodes \\"Mississippi, Tales of the Last River Rat\\" in 2005 and \\"Wye, Voices from the Valley\\" in 2007. \\"Mississippi, Tales of the Last River Rat\\" was also recognised at the Grierson Trust's British Documentary Awards in 2005. Recent award-winning episodes include \\"A Tiger Called Broken Tail\\", overall winner at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival in 2011 and Missoula's International Wildlife Film Festival (IWFF) in 2012, \\"Madagascar, Lemurs and Spies\\", a three-time winner at IWFF in 2012, \\"My Life As A Turkey\\", recipient of the Golden Panda at the Wildscreen Festival in 2012 and \\"Kangaroo Dundee\\", a prize-winner at Jackson Hole and IWFF in 2013.

Ethnologue The term \\"Virgin Islands Creole\\" is formal terminology used by scholars and academics, and is rarely used in everyday speech. Informally, the creole is known by the term dialect, as the creole is often perceived by locals as a dialect variety of English instead of an English creole language.Wiltshire, Shari (January 28‚Äì29, 2007). \\"Crucian: Dialect or a language? Professor at UVI to publish dictionary\\". St. Croix Avis However, academic sociohistorical and linguistic research suggests that it is in fact an English creole language.\\"Virgin Islands Creoles\\" Because there are several varieties of Virgin Islands Creole, it is also colloquially known by the specific island on which it is spoken: Crucian dialect, Thomian dialect, Tortolian dialect, Saint Martin dialect, Saba dialect, Statia dialect.  History  The creole was formed when enslaved Africans, unable to communicate with each other and their European owners due to being taken from different regions of West Africa with different languages, created an English-based pidgin with West African-derived words and grammatical structure. This was creolized as it was passed on to subsequent generations as their native tongue. St. Thomas and St. John, although Danish colonies, had a European population of mainly Dutch origin, which led to enslaved Africans first creating a Dutch-based creole, known as Negerhollands (now considered a dead language, although there may be a few who recall some of the vocabulary and may have passed it down to the next generation). Negerhollands was in mainstream usage on St. Thomas and St. John up until the 19th century, when the British occupied the Danish West Indies from 1801 to 1802 and 1807 to 1815. In addition, as English became preferred as a trade and business language in the busy port of Charlotte Amalie, Virgin Islands Creole became established in preference to Negerhollands. Some of the population continued to use Negerhollands well into the 20th century. Unlike the continental European population of the other Danish West Indian islands, that of St. Croix was mostly of English, Irish and Scottish origin, which led to African slaves developing an English-based creole throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. By the 19th century, Virgin Islands Creole was spoken on St. Thomas and St. John, as Negerhollands was fading away. By the end of the 19th century, English creole completely replaced Negerhollands as the native dialect of St. Thomas and St. John. The creole had also been developing in the present-day British Virgin Islands. The British took over the islands from the Dutch in 1672. Enslaved Africans were brought to work on plantations on the islands of Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke where they, like those enslaved on St. Croix over 40 miles away, developed an English-based creole. Although the U.S. and British Virgin Islands are politically separate, they share a common Virgin Islands culture, similar history based on colonialism and slavery, and some common bloodlines. Like those in the Virgin Islands, African slaves were brought to the SSS islands of Saba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin. The prevalence of Europeans from the British Isles on these islands, as well as the SSS islands' proximity and trade with nearby English-speaking islands, resulted in an English creole being spoken in the SSS islands. Due to the heavy importation of workers from Saint Martin after the 1848 emancipation in the Danish West Indies, as well as a tendency for wealthy planters to own plantations in both the Virgin Islands and SSS islands, the \\"ancestral\\" inhabitants (descendants of the original African slaves and European colonists) of the SSS islands share common bloodlines and a common culture with those of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. Varieties Today the creole is native to the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and the nearby \\"SSS islands\\" of Saba, Saint Martin (both French and Dutch sides) and Sint Eustatius. Though not called by the same name, the Virgin Islands and SSS varieties are considered by linguists to be the same creole. There are slight variations from island to island. The speech of St. Croix (known as Crucian) is the most distinct, sharing many similarities with the English creoles of Belize and Panama. This is perhaps due to migration from St. Croix to Panama during the building of the Panama Canal. The speech of the SSS islands is slightly closer to that of the British Virgin Islands than the speech of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The speech of St. Thomas and St. John shares distinct similarities with both the Crucian and British Virgin Islands variants.  Language use and perceptions  Virgin Islands Creole does not have the status of an official language. The language of government, education and the media is American English in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Queen's English in the British Virgin Islands, both Dutch and English on Saba, Sint Eustatius and the Dutch side of Saint Martin, and French on the French side of Saint Martin. Like most Anglophone Caribbean islands, a post-creole speech continuum exists, in which there are two extremes ‚Äî standard English (known as the acrolect) and the creole in its most distinct, or raw, form (known as the basilect). Due to the constant contact between standard English and Virgin Islands Creole in local society, there are many in-between speech varieties as well (known as mesolects). Most native Virgin Islanders can easily maneuver this continuum depending on their mood, subject matter, or addressee. In recent decades, the basilect form of the creole is typically only spoken among older islanders. Although the basilect is no longer in common use among the younger population, it has still been preserved by way of historical plays, folk songs and local literature. The variety spoken by middle-aged and younger Virgin Islanders today is of a mesolectal form\\"What can you find on YouTube that‚Äôs Sociolinguistically Interesting?\\", Society for Caribbean Linguistics ‚Äì Abstracts and Profiles that still retains numerous creole features, yet is slightly closer to standard English than the basilect spoken by older islanders. Virgin Islands Creole has different forms that vary by the age of the speaker, as many words and expressions are known only by older islanders, while there are also relatively newer words and expressions known only to younger islanders. The creole continues to undergo changes in a post-creole environment. Its most modern mesolectal form is mainly derived from traditional Virgin Islands Creole terms, idioms, proverbs and sentence structure, with influences from African-American and Jamaican idioms, due to the prevalence of African-American and Jamaican mainstream pop culture in the Leeward Islands region. The variant of Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix, known as Crucian, contains many Spanish-derived words due to St. Croix's large ethnic Puerto Rican population.\\"My People ‚Ä¶ Reflections of the Hispanic Contribution to the Virgin Islands\\", Virgin Islands Humanities Many Crucians of Puerto Rican descent speak a Spanglish-like code switching of Puerto Rican Spanish and the local Crucian dialect. In addition, due to long- standing historical and family ties between St. Croix and the nearby Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra, many Vieques and Culebra locals of Crucian descent also speak Crucian dialect. As the English creole is spoken in Dutch St. Martin, and Spanish is the second most dominant language there next to English and creole, Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics also speak Spanglish- like code switching of Puerto Rican and other Spanish dialects and local dialect of the island along w/ Dutch and standard English. The same situation happens in Saba and St. Eustatius, and in British Virgin Islands, they speak Spanglish-like code switching of Spanish and creole with British English. As in other Caribbean creoles, proverbs are prevalent in Virgin Islands Creole. However, in 2004, a linguistic study group in cooperation with the University of Puerto Rico‚Äôs Rio Piedras campus found that many old proverbs in the Crucian dialect, common among older generations, have faded away and are not generally known among many young Crucians.\\"University of the Virgin Islands Magazine\\", 2004 Edition Many Virgin Islanders who migrate to the United States often return with American-influenced speech patterns (colloquially known as yankin') that influence local speech of their peer groups. These changes, as well as the perception held by many older Virgin Islanders that the dialect is currently undergoing decreolization, have inspired debates on whether the dialect spoken by young Virgin Islanders today is in fact the true Virgin Islands Creole. Like most Caribbean creoles, the use of Virgin Islands Creole can vary depending on socioeconomic class. The middle and upper classes tend to speak it informally among friends and at home, but code switch to Standard English in the professional sphere. The lower socioeconomic classes tend to use the dialect in almost every aspect of daily life. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, there has been an underlying negative pressure on Virgin Islanders to eliminate their dialect due to Americanization since the 1960s. Although the United States acquired the islands from Denmark in 1917, American influence did not arrive until the early 1960s. Standard American English is associated with social mobility, as it is widely used in business and professional circles. Virgin Islands Creole, although appreciated for its cultural value and widely used informally, is often seen as an impediment to economic and educational progress.\\"Culture of the United States Virgin Islands\\", Countries and Their Cultures The majority of Virgin Islanders speak Virgin Islands Creole. However, due to immigration from the rest of the Caribbean and the United States, some Virgin Islands residents do not speak it. Most non-native longtime residents can understand spoken Virgin Islands Creole, even if not fluent in speaking themselves. In local vernacular, Virgin Islands Creole is rarely referred to as a creole, as locally, \\"creole\\" (as well as \\"patois\\") usually refers to the French-based creoles spoken by St. Lucian, Dominican (Dominica) and Haitian immigrants. Instead, Virgin Islanders tend to refer to the dialect by their native island (i.e. \\"Crucian dialect\\", \\"Thomian dialect\\", \\"Tolian dialect\\", etc.) As with other Caribbean creoles, Virgin Islands Creole is generally unwritten. However, local authors often write in the creole in the field of colloquial literature, and young Virgin Islanders tend to write in it when communicating over the Internet. Because no standard spelling system exists in Virgin Islands Creole, those who attempt to write it use English orthography. The prevailing sentiment is that Virgin Islands Creole cannot be learned like a standard language, but acquired only through having spent one's formative years in the Virgin Islands. Attempts by Virgin Islands non-native residents to speak the dialect, even out of respect, are often met with disapproval. A notable exception applies to immigrants who cannot speak English upon arrival. For example, persons from the Dominican Republic and Haiti, lacking fluency in English upon arrival, often learn Virgin Islands Creole before they are able to master standard English. In nearby French St. Martin, there are persons from France and the French West Indies who, lacking fluency in English upon arrival in St. Martin, learn the local variety of Saint Martin English spoken by the native population.  Grammatical structure and pronunciation As with other Caribbean creoles, Virgin Islands Creole has a smaller set of pronouns than English, and conjugations occur less often. For example, the English phrase \\"I gave it to her\\" would translate to \\"Ah gi'e it toh she\\" in Virgin Islands Creole. Another common pattern found in Virgin Islands Creole is the absence of the letter \\"s\\" in the plural, possessive and third person present tense.English Creole ‚Äì The Spoken Word on St. John. St. John Historical Society For example, \\"my eyes\\" would translate to \\"ma eye dem.\\" = Differences from English = The pronunciation differs from Standard English in various ways. Virgin Islands and \\"SSS islands\\" accents are somewhat similar to those of other Caribbean countries, especially Guyana, the Cayman Islands, Belize and Panama, but are also unique in many ways. As in most Anglophone Caribbean dialects, in Virgin Islands Creole, dental fricatives (the \\"-th\\" sound) are often omitted from speech, and replaced by dental stops (the \\"-t\\" sound). The vowel pronunciation of Virgin Islands Creole can widely differ from Standard English. For example, in Virgin Islands Creole (as well as most other Anglophone Caribbean creoles), the suffix \\"er\\" in English, in Standard English, is pronounced (for example: computer is pronounced (\\"computah\\"), and never is pronounced (\\"nevah\\")). Not all words ending in \\"er\\" however, are pronounced in this way. Like many other Caribbean islands, the \\"oi\\" sound in Standard English is replaced with long I (). For example, the English word \\"join\\" would be pronounced jine. Such anomalies have their roots in 17th and 18th century England, where such vowel sounds were pronounced similarly. Virgin Islands Creole also displays similarities to the English- based pidgin and creole languages of West Africa, due to their common descent from the blending of African substrate languages with English as the superstrate language. = Variations in grammar and speech among islands = Local speech varies among each of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. It is commonplace for such differences to be pointed out in jest when Virgin Islanders of different islands congregate. For example, the pronunciation of the standard English phrase \\"come here\\" would be come ya on St. Croix and come heh on St. Thomas, St. John and the British Virgin Islands. On the neighboring island of Saint Martin, it is pronounced come hyuh. In addition, the Virgin Islands Creole form of the word \\"car\\" is cyar on St. Croix and cah on St. Thomas, St. John and the British Virgin Islands. These two anomalies are due to Irish influence on St. Croix during the Danish colonial period. Vowel sounds can also widely differ between islands. For example, the word \\"special\\" is usually pronounced speshahl on St. Croix and speshuhl on St. Thomas, St. John, the British Virgin Islands, and St. Martin. \\"Island\\" is usually pronounced islahn' on St. Croix and isluhn' on St. Thomas, St. John, the British Virgin Islands, and St. Martin. Another commonly cited example of linguistic differences between the islands is the usage of the term deh, the Virgin Islands Creole form of the standard English adverb \\"there\\". On St. Croix, an additional deh is often added, forming the phrase deh-deh. Such usage is found in many Caribbean islands outside the Virgin Islands, as well. There are many instances where words and phrases (especially slang) that exist on one island may not exist on another. In addition, the Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix is often described as being more raw, or distant from standard English, than those of the other Virgin Islands.

Œôt contains a curse or magic spell (, katadesmos) inscribed on a lead scroll, dated to the first half of the 4th century BC (circa 375‚Äì350 BC). It was published in the Hellenic Dialectology Journal in 1993. It is one of four known texts that may represent a local dialectal form of ancient Greek in Macedonia, all of them identifiable as Doric.O‚ÄôNeil, James. 26th Conference of the Australasian Society for Classical Studies, 2005. These suggest that a Doric Greek dialect was spoken in Macedonia, as was previously proposed based on the West Greek forms of names found in Macedonia. As a result, the Pella curse tablet has been forwarded as an argument that the Ancient Macedonian language was a dialect of North-Western Greek, and one of the Doric dialects.; ; .. The spell was written by a woman, possibly named Dagina, and was intended to cause her former lover to marry her. Interpretation The Pella katadesmos. It is a magic spell or love charm written by a woman, possibly named Dagina (Ancient Greek: ŒîŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒΩŒ±), whose lover Dionysoph≈çn (ŒîŒπŒøŒΩœÖœÉŒøœÜ·ø∂ŒΩ, gen.: ŒîŒπŒøŒΩœÖœÉŒøœÜ·ø∂ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ) is apparently about to marry Thetima (ŒòŒµœÑŒØŒºŒ±, \\"she who honors the gods\\"; the Attic Greek form is Theotimƒì - ŒòŒµŒøœÑŒØŒºŒ∑). She invokes \\"Makron and the demons\\" (parkattithemai makr≈çni kai [tois] daimosi - œÄŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ±œÑœÑŒØŒ∏ŒµŒºŒ±Œπ ŒºŒ¨Œ∫œÅœâŒΩŒπ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ [œÑŒø·øñœÇ] Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒºŒøœÉŒπ; in Attic, œÄŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ±œÑœÑŒØŒ∏ŒµŒºŒ±Œπ is parakatatithemai - œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÑŒØŒ∏ŒµŒºŒ±Œπ) to cause Dionysophon to marry her instead of Thetima. Dagina also wants him never to marry another woman, unless she herself recovers and unrolls the scroll. She wishes for herself to grow old by the side of Dionysophon.. The tablet is also described as a \\"mixed curse\\" due to the supplicative nature of the appeal. For example, the word ŒïŒ°ŒóŒúŒë or \\"abandoned\\" is quite common in appeals to divine powers.. Katadesmoi or defixiones were spells written on non-perishable material, such as lead, stone or baked clay, and were secretly buried to ensure their physical integrity, which would then guarantee the permanence of their intended effects. The language is a distinct form of North-West Greek, and the low social status of its writer, as (arguably) evidenced by her vocabulary and belief in magic, strongly suggests that a unique form of West Greek was spoken by lower-class people in Pella at the time the tablet was written. This should not, however, be taken to indicate that only those of middling or low social status practiced magic in the Ancient Greek world; quite wealthy individuals might also use lead katadesmoi (curse tablets) for love, revenge, and to bind their opponents in athletic contests.; .

But guard [this] for my sake so that these things do not happen, and wretched Thetima perishes miserably. :8. ... but that I become happy and blessed. Points of interpretation *\\"Makron\\" (line 2) is most probably the name of the dead man in whose grave the tablet was deposited. This was commonly done in the belief that the deceased would \\"convey\\" the message to the Chthonic spirits of the Greek underworld (the \\"daimones\\" in lines 3 and 6). *The missing word in line 6 between \\"I am your supplicant\\" and \\"have pity\\" (here reconstructed as [Phil?]a) is carved at the edge of the tablet and the only things we can read of it are that it is a short word that ends in-AN. \\"PHILAN\\" is a likely reconstruction, but by no means the only one possible. If true, the word \\"PHILAN\\" could equally well be either the personal name \\"Phila\\" or the feminine adjective \\"phila\\", \\"friend\\" or \\"dear one\\". In the latter case, an alternative reading of line 6 would be: \\"Have pity on your dear one, dear daimones\\". In the former case, a personal name would be perfectly placed but, as the name of the person who wrote the curse is not mentioned elsewhere, it is impossible to know with certainty what the missing word is. *The word \\"DAGINA\\" (line 6) is inexplicable and previously unattested, even as a personal name. The alternative has been suggested by Dubois,. that it is a misspelling, and that the writer intended to write \\"dapina\\" (the difference between Œì and Œ† being a single stroke). If true, this may mean that dapina is an (also unattested) Macedonian rendering of what would be written \\"œÑŒ±œÄŒµŒπŒΩŒÆ\\", tapeinƒì (humble, lowly, brought low), in standard Attic. In this case the inscription reads: \\"for I am lowly from all my dear ones and abandoned\\" etc. Another possibility is that Dagina is perhaps related to Œ¥Œ±Œ≥œçœÇ, a doll or puppet, especially as used in magic (cf. LSJ p. 364). Similarly, ŒôŒúŒï is also unexplained, but seems to be taken as a misspelling of ŒïŒúŒô (ŒµŒºŒπ) (i.e., Attic Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ), \\"I am.\\" Dating According to D. R. Jordan (Duke University), the tablet has been dated to the \\"Mid-IV [century] or slightly earlier\\".. Significance The discovery of the Pella curse tablet, according to Olivier Masson, substantiates the view that the ancient Macedonian language was a form of North-West Greek:. > \\"Yet in contrast with earlier views which made of it {i.e. Macedonian} an > Aeolic dialect (O. Hoffmann compared Thessalian) we must by now think of a > link with North-West Greek (Locrian, Aetolian, Phocidian, Epirote). This > view is supported by the recent discovery at Pella of a curse tablet (4th > cent. BC), which may well be the first 'Macedonian' text attested > (provisional publication by E. Voutyras; cf. the Bulletin Epigraphique in > Rev. Et. Grec. 1994, no. 413); the text includes an adverb \\"opoka\\" which is > not Thessalian.\\" Of the same opinion is James L. O'Neil's (University of Sydney) presentation at the 2005 Conference of the Australasian Society for Classical Studies, entitled \\"Doric Forms in Macedonian Inscriptions\\" (abstract)Scientific Analysis of the Pella Curse Tablet by James L. O‚ÄôNeil, (University of Sydney): > \\"A fourth‚Äêcentury BC curse tablet from Pella shows word forms which are > clearly Doric, but a different form of Doric from any of the west Greek > dialects of areas adjoining Macedon. Three other, very brief, fourth century > inscriptions are also indubitably Doric.

And yet later Macedonian inscriptions are in Koine > avoiding both Doric forms and the Macedonian voicing of consonants. The > native Macedonian dialect had become unsuitable for written documents.\\" Professor Johannes Engels of the University of Cologne argues that the Pella curse tablet provides evidence to support that Macedonian was a North-West Greek dialect: > \\"Another very important testimony comes from the so-called Pella curse > tablet.

This law was named after Eus√©bio de Queir√≥s Coutinho Matoso da C√¢mara, who was the Brazilian Minister of Justice from 1848‚Äì1852. This law was put into action by the government acting under Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II. This law reinforced a law that was put into place on November 7, 1831, but had never been fully enforced and it also was based on an 1837 anti-slave trade bill of Felisberto Caldeira Brant, which had not been enacted into a law. This bill was modified and reintroduced into the Chamber of deputies and eventually passed. Even though the slave trade was officially abolished in 1850, slavery itself was not abolished in Brazil until 1888. Which made Brazil the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The government was, however, against the British pressures applied to end such trade, such as the seizure of slave ships by British war ships. In 1845, the British parliament enacted the Aberdeen Act, which allowed British Cruisers to seize Brazilian slave ships in attempts to end their slave trade. This caused Brazilians to import as many slaves as possible in case the British succeeded in abolishing their slave trade, which is why the vast majority of slaves arrived in Brazil during 1847‚Äì1849. Slavery in Brazil was extremely prevalent and slave ships carried between 3.6 and 5 million slaves into Brazil over roughly three centuries (1525-1851). Rio de Janeiro alone had the largest slave population where 38.3% of their population consisted of slaves, or 80,000 slaves.

She also lived ten years in Portugal before moving to Germany, and that's reflected in some of her songs, featuring lyrics in Portuguese. Valerie played in an all- female band called L.B.Page, until 1998, when she released a 7\\" called Safe Side under the moniker Lali Puna. She was later joined by Markus Acher, already lead singer and guitarist of The Notwist and Tied & Tickled Trio (with whom she was also romantically involved and also formed a side-project called John Yoko), Christoph Brandner, who played drums with Acher in the Tied & Tickled Trio, and keyboardist Florian Zimmer.

They include painters David Wayne Cole, Thomas David Little (1955‚Äì2006), and James F. Quinlan, sculptor Christopher Cosma, computer artist Jeff Brice, and multi-media artists Peter Brill and Mark Bloch. The group soon grew to include others including Douglas Ferguson, Sylvia Sherry, Susan Cole, Lauren Silver, Nan Truitt and John Fletcher. The word M'bwebwe does not in itself mean anything. It was uttered at random one day, although who uttered it is now forgotten, when it was time to select a name for a particular event and it stuck. It has since come to represent either a place or a group of artists, depending on usage. In 1978, M'bwebwe began as an art space at 23 Second Avenue on Manhattan's Lower East Side. The living quarters and studios, located above a Jewish monument store in a former B'nai B'rith meeting hall, soon became a de facto exhibition space, dance club and neighborhood hangout that garnered attention by hipsters and cognoscenti around the rapidly changing area soon to be known as the East Village. While the M'bwebwe painting style held craftsmanship in high esteem, the subject matter could be described as irreverent, Dada, tongue in cheek and funky. A number of musical projects, most notably by Quinlan, Brill, Little and Bloch, took the funk idea back to its roots as a musical style (see George Clinton, James Brown and Robert Wyatt) that was blended with elements of Devo and Pere Ubu that had also come out of northern Ohio. M'bwebwe is also linked to predecessors such as Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus, concept art, punk, industrial music, and electropop, and most importantly, 'pataphysics. The M'bwebwe group is less a style of art or music than a loosely-knit group of artists from the midwest with a likeminded penchant for the Gabba Gabba Hey sensibility that could be heard emanating from the club CBGB located just behind the M'bwebwe space on Second Avenue.

Head trainer Rudimar Fedrigo later expanded the program in 1991 to include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and other aspects of modern mixed martial arts. By 1995, the Chute Boxe team was considered a prime training ground for Vale Tudo fighters. In 2004, an American branch, Chute Boxe USA, was established in Los Angeles, California. Chute Boxe fighters are characterized by being extremely aggressive and physical, as well as well- rounded fighters, able to use submissions, punches, kicks, and various grappling styles as needed. Beginnings The Chute Boxe team first made a name for themselves in the MMA world during the late 1990s in the Brazilian vale tudo promotion known as the IVC. With an aggressive and physical style focused around their muay thai skills, Chute Boxe fighters captured three of the four title belts in the promotion (Wanderlei Silva winning the light heavyweight belt, Jos√© Landi-Jons winning the middleweight belt, and Rafael Cordeiro winning the lightweight belt). The promotion ended up serving as a spring board for the Chute Boxe team (as well as many other Brazilian MMA stars) into the lucrative Japanese MMA market. For Chute Boxe specifically, it would help to launch their careers in Japan's PRIDE FC. PRIDE FC dynasty The major cog of the Chute Boxe machine in PRIDE was Wanderlei Silva. Known for an exciting, brawling style complete with lethal knees and leaping stomps, he would exemplify Chute Boxe style martial arts in PRIDE's middleweight division and eventually win the 2003 PRIDE FC Middleweight Grand Prix and the PRIDE FC middleweight title which he would hold for 5 1/2 years. Coming off of a disappointing five-round decision loss to Tito Ortiz at UFC 25: Ultimate Japan, Silva would return to PRIDE to earn the biggest victory of his career to that point over the Lion's Den's Guy Mezger. It would be 20 fights and over four years before he would lose again in a controversial decision to superheavyweight Mark Hunt. During this span he defeated notable fighters Kazushi Sakuraba (three times), Quinton ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù Jackson (twice), Yuki Kondo, Ikuhisa Minowa, Hidehiko Yoshida, Kiyoshi Tamura, Dan Henderson, Alexander Otsuka, Shungo Oyama, Hiromitsu Kanehara, and would draw with Mirko \\"Cro Cop\\" Filipoviƒá. His aura of invincibility wouldn't truly be broken until a decision loss to Ricardo Arona in the 2005 PRIDE FC middle weight Grand Prix. His loss would be avenged later that night by teammate and rising star, Mauricio ‚ÄúShogun‚Äù Rua. =Enter the Rua brothers= As the older of the Rua brothers, Murilo ‚ÄúNinja‚Äù Rua had a mediocre run during his years with PRIDE FC. Wins over Mario Sperry, Akira Shoji and Alexander Otsuka established him as a contender in the organization. His younger brother Mauricio \\"Shogun\\" Rua would also enter the PRIDE fighting championships and would prove the most successful fighter produced by Chute Boxe under Wanderlei Silva's and Ninja's guidance. Younger than Murilo by about a year and a half, ‚ÄúShogun‚Äù has defeated a who's who list of fighters including Evangelista ‚ÄúCyborg‚Äù Santos, Akira Shoji, Akihiro Gono, Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson, Alistair Overeem (twice), Antonio Rogerio ‚ÄúMinotouro‚Äù Nogueira, Ricardo Arona, Kevin Randleman, Mark Coleman, Chuck Liddell, and Lyoto Machida. Shogun was the UFC light heavyweight champion until losing his first title defense against Jon Jones at UFC 128. His exciting, fan-friendly style includes much of the standard Chute Boxe Muay Thai clinch work, knees, stomps, and soccer kicks, as well as polished Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. =Rivalry with Brazilian Top Team= The opposite number in terms of Brazilian dominance in PRIDE FC was the Brazilian Top Team which was comprised, at the time, of such fighters as Antonio Rodrigo ‚ÄúMinotauro‚Äù Nogueira, Ricardo Arona, and Murilo Bustamante. Competition between the two teams was hardly limited to the Pride scene however. Matches between fighters of the two organizations had taken place in Brazil, Portugal and other parts of the world before, but perhaps the most interesting chapter of the rivalry took place on August 28, 2005 at the 2005 PRIDE FC middle weight Grand Prix. The 2005 PRIDE FC middleweight Grand Prix would be the first such competition for newcomers Mauricio Rua and BTT's Ricardo Arona. Both scored impressive victories over highly regarded veterans Alistair Overeem and middleweight champ Wanderlei Silva respectively. It was Arona's victory over the latter that would stoke the flames of the rivalry because until then Silva had been the torch-bearer for Chute Boxe. Later that night, however, ‚ÄúShogun‚Äù would pick up the torch with a thoroughly dominating first- round KO of Arona, ultimately finishing him on the ground which was considered Arona's strength. Another notable aspect of this period is that it shortly followed the departure of promising prospect Anderson Silva. Silva had noted several disputes with Chute Boxe's management as reasons for leaving the team and shortly began training with some of Brazilian Top Team's best in the Nogueira brothers. He was quoted in an ESPN article as stating that friendships formed with his former rivals helped to save his career upon his departure from Chute Boxe. Post-Pride era With the demise of PRIDE FC in late 2007, coinciding with the departure of its first mass-appeal superstar Wanderlei Silva around the same time, Chute Boxe entered a new era. Moreover, the Rua brothers, Mauricio and Murilo, and Andre \\"Dida\\" Amade, also departed Chute Boxe to start their own gym. However, up and coming fighters, such as lightweight Jean Silva, have augmented their talent. In addition, fighter Evangelista Santos has recently competed in Strikeforce as well as his ex- wife, female fighter Cristiane \\"Cyborg\\" Santos, who is currently Chute Boxe's most marketable fighter.

Early life and education Asante was born Arthur Lee Smith Jr. in Valdosta, Georgia, the fourth of sixteen children. His father, Arthur Lee Smith, worked in a peanut warehouse and then on the Georgia Southern Railroad; his mother worked as a domestic. During the summers Asante would return to Georgia to work in the tobacco and cotton fields in order to earn tuition for school. An aunt, Georgia Smith, influenced him to pursue his education; she gave him his first book, a collection of short stories by Charles Dickens. Patricia Reid- Merritt. \\"Molefi Kete Asante,\\" Encyclopedia of African American History, Leslie M. Alexander and Walter C. Rucker (eds), ABC-CLIO, 2010, pp. 617‚Äì618. Smith attended Nashville Christian Institute, a Church of Christ-founded boarding school for black students, in Nashville, Tennessee. There he earned his high school diploma in 1960. While still in high school, he became involved with the Civil Rights Movement, joining the Fisk University student march in Nashville.Dr. John Henrik Clark Group Research Project. We're not going to take it anymore, Gerald G. Jackson (ed.), Beckham Publications Group, Inc., 2005, pp. 90‚Äì91. After graduation, he initially enrolled in Southwestern Christian College of Terrell, Texas, another historically black institution with Church of Christ roots. There he met Nigerian Essien Essien, whose character and intelligence inspired Smith to learn more about Africa. Smith received his B.A. from Oklahoma Christian College (now Oklahoma Christian University) in 1964. He did graduate work, earning his M.A. from Pepperdine University in 1965 with a thesis on Marshall Keeble, a black Church of Christ preacher. Smith earned his PhD from UCLA in 1968 in communication studies. He worked for a time at UCLA, becoming the director of the Center for Afro- American Studies. At the age of 30, he was appointed by the University at Buffalo as a full professor and head of the Department of Communication. In 1976, Asante chose to make a legal name change because he considered \\"Arthur Lee Smith\\" a slave name. Career At the University at Buffalo, Asante advanced the ideas of international and intercultural communication; he wrote and published with colleagues, Handbook of Intercultural Communication, the first book in the field. Asante was elected president of the Society for Intercultural Education, Training and Research in 1976. His work in intercultural communication made him a leading trainer of doctoral students in the field. Asante has directed more than one hundred PhD dissertations. Asante published his first study of the black movement, Rhetoric of Black Revolution, in 1969. Subsequently, he wrote Transracial Communication, to explain how race complicates human interaction in American society. Soon Asante changed his focus to African-American and African culture in communication, with attention to the nature of African-American oratorical style. Asante wrote Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change (1980) to announce a break with the past, where African-Americans believed they were on the margins of Europe and did not have a sense of historical centrality. He wrote on the conflict between white cultural hegemony and the oppressed African culture, and on the lack of victorious consciousness among Africans, a theme found in his principal philosophical work, The Afrocentric Idea (1987). Additional works on Afrocentric theory included Kemet, Afrocentricity and Knowledge (1990), and An Afrocentric Manifesto (2007). The Utne Reader identified Asante as one of the 100 leading thinkers in America, writing, \\"Asante is a genial, determined, and energetic cultural liberationist whose many books, including Afrocentricity and The Afrocentric Idea, articulate a powerful African-oriented pathway of thought, action, and cultural self-confidence for black Americans.\\" In 1986 Asante proposed the first doctoral program in African-American studies to the administration at Temple University. This program was approved, and the first class entered the doctorate in 1988. More than 500 applicants had sought admission to the graduate program. Temple became known as the leader among the African-American Studies departments; it was 10 years before the next doctoral program was introduced in this field, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1997. Alumni from the Temple program are found in every continent, many nations, and many direct African American Studies programs at major universities. =Honors= * Given the regnal name of Nana Okru Asante Peasah and the chieftaincy title of Kyidomhene of the House of Tafo, Akyem Abuakwa, Ghana (1995) * Given the chieftaincy title of the Wanadoo of Gao in the court of the Amiru (Paramount Chief) Hassimi Maiga of Songhai (2012) Afrocentricity According to The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Historical Writing Since 1945, Asante has \\"based his entire career on Afrocentricity, and continues to defend it in spite of strong criticisms\\". In 1980 Asante published Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change, which initiated a discourse around the issue of African agency and subject place in historical and cultural phenomena. He maintained that Africans had been moved off-center in terms on most questions of identity, culture, and history. Afrocentricity sought to place Africans at the center of their own narratives and to reclaim the teaching of African-American history from where it had been marginalized by Europeans. Asante's book The Afrocentric Idea was a more intellectual book about Afrocentricity than the earlier popular book. After the second edition of The Afrocentric Idea was released in 1998, Asante appeared as a guest on a number of television programs, including The Today Show, 60 Minutes, and the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, to discuss his ideas. According to Asante's Afrocentric Manifesto, an Afrocentric project requires a minimum of five characteristics: (1) an interest in a psychological location, (2) a commitment to finding the African subject place, (3) the defense of African cultural elements, (4) a commitment to lexical refinement, and (5) a commitment to correct the dislocations in the history of Africa.Molefi Kete Asante, \\"Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in the World\\", in Selected bibliography *An Afrocentric Manifesto: Toward an African Renaissance (Polity, 2007), *As I Run toward Africa: A Memoir (Paradigm Publishers, 2011), *Cheikh Anta Diop: An Intellectual Portrait (Sankore Madrasah, 2007) *Contemporary Black Thought: Alternative Analyses in Social and Behavioral Science (Sage, 1980) *Contemporary Critical Thought in Africology and Africana Studies (Lexington Books, 2016) *Contemporary Public Communication: Applications (Harper & Row, 1977) *Encyclopedia of African Religion (Sage, 2009) *Encyclopedia of Black Studies (Sage, 2004), *Erasing Racism: The Survival of the American Nation (Prometheus, 2009, 2003) *Facing South to Africa: Toward an Afrocentric Critical Orientation (Lexington Books, 2014) *Handbook of Black Studies (Sage, 2006), *Mass Communication: Principles and Practices (Macmillan, 1979) *Maulana Karenga: An Intellectual Portrait (Polity, 2009) *100 Greatest African Americans (Prometheus, 2002) *Socio- Cultural Conflict between African American and Korean American (University Press of America, 2000) *Spear Masters: An Introduction to African Religion (University Press of America, 2007), *The African American People: A Global History (Routledge, 2012) *The Afrocentric Idea (Temple University Press, 1998, 1987) *The Painful Demise of Eurocentrism: An Afrocentric Response to Critics (Africa World Press, 1999), *Transracial Communication (Prentice Hall, 1973), References External links * Dr. Molefi Kete Asante ‚Äì Official Web site * Molefi Kete Asante Institute for Afrocentric Studies Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:African-American academics Category:African-American social scientists Category:American social scientists Category:African-American writers Category:Afrocentrists Category:20th-century American philosophers Category:21st-century philosophers Category:American non-fiction writers Category:Communication theorists Category:American pan-Africanists Category:Oklahoma Christian University alumni Category:Pepperdine University alumni Category:Pennsylvania political activists Category:African-American studies scholars Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Temple University faculty Category:People from Valdosta, Georgia Category:African-American university administrators Category:African-American educators Category:University at Buffalo faculty ","title":"Molefi Kete Asante"},{"id":"2069452","text":"Founders, Douglas Grama and David Lotwin (2000) D&D; Studios was a recording studio located in New York City on the west side of 37th street.

The two stars are separated by an angle of 7.10‚Ä≥, which corresponds to an estimated semimajor axis of 56.30 AU for their orbit. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 0.16625 arc seconds as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is from Earth. It is approaching the Solar System at a velocity of approximately 129 kilometers per second. At this rate, it will make its closest approach in 41,100 years when it comes to within of the Sun. This star system has been examined for an excess of radiation in the infrared. The presence of an infrared excess can be taken as an indication of a debris disk orbiting the star. However, no such excess was discovered around HR 7703. Radial velocity data collected over a period of 12 years was examined for signs of periodicity caused by a planet orbiting at a distance of 3‚Äì6 AU, but none was detected. A slight linear trend in the radial velocities of the primary is probably due to the companion star.

Economic, social and cultural rights are recognised and protected in international and regional human rights instruments. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil economic, social and cultural rights and are expected to take \\"progressive action\\" towards their fulfilment. The Universal Declaration on Human Rights recognises a number of economic, social and cultural rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women recognises and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognised in the ICESCR in relation to children and women. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also prohibits all discrimination on the basis of the disability including refusal of the reasonable accommodation relating to full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  International and regional human rights instruments  Women's economic rights in 2011. Economic, social and cultural rights are recognized and protected in a number of international and regional human rights instruments. = International human rights instruments = The Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, is one of the most important sources of economic, social and cultural rights. It recognizes the right to social security in Article 22, the right to work in Article 23, the right to rest and leisure in Article 24, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 25, the right to education in Article 26, and the right to benefits of science and culture in Article 27. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The Covenant recognized and protects the right to work and to just and favorable working conditions in Article 6 and 7, the right to join trade unions and take collective labor action in Article 8, the right to social security in Article 9, the right to protection of the family, including protection for mothers and children, in Article 10, the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to food and the right to housing, in Article 11, the right to health in Article 12, the right to education in Article 13, as well as the right to participate in cultural life and the right to benefits of science and culture in Article 15. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted at the same time as the ICESCR, recognizes and protects a number of core economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to join trade unions in Article 22, and the right of ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities to engage in their culture, practice their religion and use their language in Article 27. A number of other major international human rights instruments contain provisions relating to economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognized in the ICESCR in relation to children. Including the right to health in Article 24, the right to social security in Article 25, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 27, the right to education in Article 28, and the right to protection from economic exploitation (see child labour) in Article 32. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women affirms a range of economic, social and cultural rights to women. The ILO Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) protect a range of work related economic, social and cultural rights. Common global standards were agreed by some 195 states in the Recommendation on Science and Scientific protect and reassert scientific freedoms, the rights of scientists, and rights of research subjects, and the right of everyone to science. = Regional human rights instruments = The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights protects the right to work in Article 15, the right to health in Article 16, and the right to education in Article 17. The European Social Charter protects a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to work, to favourable working conditions, the right to join trade unions and to take collective labour action in Article 1 to 10, the right to health in Article 11, the right to social security, including the right to medical assistance and the right to social welfare services, in Article 12 to 14, protection of especially vulnerable groups are enshrined in Article 15 to 17 and 19, and right to housing in Article 31. The Protocol of San Salvador protects a range of economic, social and cultural rights within the Inter-American human rights system.  Secondary legal sources  A range of secondary legal sources exist on economic, social and cultural rights which provide guidance on their normative definition. An important secondary legal source is the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which is overseeing the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The Committee has been central in developing the normative definition of key economic, social and cultural rights, interpreting the role of State Parties to the ICESCR, and monitoring protection and violation of the ICESCR rights. The Committee issues guiding pronouncements in the form of general comments, and other human rights treaty bodies may also issue comments relevant to economic, social and cultural rights. Other important secondary legal sources on economic, social and cultural rights are the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1987 and the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1997. The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines build on the Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations of economic, social and cultural rights. Various United Nations Special Rapporteurs have influenced the normative development of economic, social and cultural rights. Appointed by the Commission on Human Rights and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.  National constitutions  A number of national constitutions recognize economic, social and cultural rights. For example, the 1996 Constitution of South Africa includes economic, social and cultural rights and the South African Constitutional Court has heard claims under these obligations (see Grootboom and Treatment Action Campaign cases). India's constitution, which does not explicitly recognize economic and social rights in their constitution, has nonetheless found that these rights exist, though unenumerated, inferable from the right to life. Constitutional recognition of economic, social and cultural rights has long been thought to be counterproductive, given that courts might be tasked to adjudicate them, and hence disrupt the democratic chains of accountability of the so-called elected branches. Nonetheless, a growing literature from the Global South has tracked very different judicial responses.  State responsibility  Economic, social and cultural right enshrined in international and regional human rights instruments are legally binding. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. The exact nature of states' obligations in this respect has been established principally in relation to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and further Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has been established in accordance with Vienna Declaration and Programme of ActionVienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II paragraph 75 State parties to the ICESCR are required to take \\"progressive action\\" towards fulfilment of the ICESR rights. While immediate fulfilment may not be possible due to the economic situation of a country, postponement of proactive action is not permitted. State parties must show genuine efforts to secure the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the ICESCR. The burden of proof for progressive action is considered on be with the state party. The prohibition on discrimination in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is regarded as having immediate effect. State parties must abolish laws, policies and practices which affect the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and take action to prevent discrimination in public life. All state parties, regardless of the economic situation in the country or resource scarcity, are required to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. State parties must also ensure that available resources are accessed and used equitably. Therefore, government decisions on how to allocate resources should be subject to scrutiny. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the ICESCR and state parties are expected to provide judicial remedies in addition to taking administrative, financial, educational and social measures.  Monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework  Intergovernmental organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have persistently neglected economic, social and cultural rights over the past 50 years. While all human rights are said to be \\"equal, indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent\\", the monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework for economic, social and cultural rights is less advanced than that for civil and political rights. International enforcement mechanisms are strongest for civil and political rights, and their violation is considered more serious than that of economic, social and cultural rights. There are few international NGOs that focus on economic, social and cultural rights and there are few lawyers who have the knowledge or experience to defend economic, social and cultural rights at a national or international level. Economic, social and cultural rights are less likely than civil and political rights to be protected in national constitutions. In 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which gives the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights competence to receive and consider communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Covenant have been violated by a state party. The Protocol entered into force on 5 May 2013. In 2017, for the common global standards in the Recommendation on Science and Scientific Researchers relating to the right to science, states agreed at the UNESCO General Conference to adopt four-yearly reporting on implementation, and agreed that UNESCO's Executive Board is competent to manage monitoring, with the networks of UNESCO National Commissions and academic partners mobilized in countries to ensure implementation and monitoring at country level. For the other major international human rights conventions mentioned above there are various other treaty bodies to ensure some monitoring of implementation. And each may transmit to the Human Rights Council reports of individual cases when a state is the subject of a Universal Periodic Review.  Education is a human right  Education is guaranteed as a human right in many human rights treaties, including: 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO) license. * the Convention against Discrimination in Education (1960, CADE) * the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966, ICESCR) * the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979, CEDAW) * the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989, CRC). The right to education places the individual at the centre of education frameworks. Education as a human right has the following characteristics: * it is a right: Education is not a privilege or subject to political or charitable whims. It is a human right. It places mandatory demands on duty-bearers (particularly the state, but also parents, children, and other actors.) * it is universal: Everyone has the right to education without discrimination. This includes children, adolescents, youths, adults, and older people * it is high priority: Education is a key priority of the state. Obligations to ensure the right to education cannot be dismissed * it is a key right: Education is instrumental in ensuring all other human rights. It has economic, social, cultural, civil, and political dimensions The right to education places legal obligations on states when they make decisions regarding education and the education system. It offers an internationally agreed normative framework for the standards that states must not fall beneath concerning the education of its citizens and non- citizens. Education as a multiplier right These standards define what states must do and avoid doing in order to ensure the dignity of the individual. The right to education is broad and covers many aspects of education. This means that for the specific areas related to education, states must act within the boundaries permitted under international human rights law (IHRL). The main aspects of education are: * the aims of education * non-discrimination and equality in the education system * free and compulsory universal primary education * available and accessible, free education at the secondary level, including vocational education * accessible (on the basis of capacity), free education at the tertiary level * fundamental education for those who have not received all or part of their primary education * maintenance of an education system at all levels * provision of a fellowship system * the training of teachers, their status, and their working conditions * educational freedom, that is, the freedom of parents to have their children educated in accordance with their religious and moral convictions * the freedom of individuals and organizations to set-up private schools * quality education, including setting minimum standards regarding infrastructure and human rights education * safe and non-violent learning environments * the allocation of adequate resources * academic freedom at all levels of education * the setting and content of the curriculum * transparent and accountable education systems  Advocacy  Networking groups such as ESCR-Net are working to create online resources and spread information about effective cases, initiatives, and working groups promoting ideals and celebrating victories of human rights initiatives and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Currently, human rights advocacy groups are working diligently to fine-tune rules, regulations and implementation schemes; little news of complaint successes or failures is available.‚ÄúCampaign for the Ratification and Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR-Justice NOW!

Hassine, Regularizing Property Rights in Kosovo and Elsewhere, 2010,  Theory of rights  According to Karel Vasak's theory of three generations of human rights, economic, social and cultural rights are considered second-generation rights, while civil and political rights, such as freedom of speech, right to a fair trial, and the right to vote, are considered first-generation rights.Karel Vasak, \\"Human Rights: A Thirty-Year Struggle: the Sustained Efforts to give Force of law to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\\", UNESCO Courier 30:11, Paris: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, November 1977.

It is more closely associated with the semiotics of Charles Peirce (1839‚Äì1914) than Ferdinand de Saussure (1857‚Äì1913) because meaning is conceived as an effect of a set of signs. In the Peircean model, a reference is made to an object when the sign (or representamen) is interpreted recursively by another sign (which becomes its interpretant), a conception of meaning that does in fact imply a classification of sign types. Discussion of sign-type The psychology of perception suggests the existence of a common cognitive system that treats all or most sensorily conveyed meanings in the same way. If all signs must also be objects of perception, there is every reason to believe that their modality will determine at least part of their nature. Thus, the sensory modalities will be visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, kinesthetic, etc. A list of sign types would include: writing, symbol, index, image, map, graph, diagram, etc. Some combinations of signs can be multi-modal, i.e. different types of signs grouped together for effect. But the distinction between a medium and a modality should be clarified: *text is a medium for presenting the modality of natural language; *image is both a medium and a modality; *music is a modality for the auditory media. So, the modality refers to a certain type of information and/or the representation format in which information is stored. The medium is the means whereby this information is delivered to the senses of the interpreter. Natural language is the primary modality, having many invariant properties across the auditory media as spoken language, the visual media as written language, the tactile media as Braille, and kinetic media as sign language. When meaning is conveyed by spoken language, it is converted into sound waves broadcast by the speaker and received by another's ears. Yet this stimulus cannot be divorced from the visual evidence of the speaker's manner and gestures, and the general awareness of the physical location and its possible connotative significance. Similarly, meaning that is contained in a visual form cannot be divorced from the iconicity and implications of the form. If handwritten, is the writing neat or does it evidence emotion in its style. What type of paper is used, what colour ink, what kind of writing instrument: all such questions are relevant to an interpretation of the significance of what is represented. But images are distinguishable from natural language. For Roland Barthes (1915‚Äì80), language functions with relatively determinate meanings whereas images \\"say\\" nothing. Nevertheless, there is a rhetoric for arranging the parts that are to signify, and an emerging, if not yet generally accepted, syntax that articulates their parts and binds them into an effective whole. Rhetorician Thomas Rosteck defined rhetoric \\"as the use of language and other symbolic systems to make sense of our experiences, construct our personal and collective identities, produce meaning, and prompt action in the world\\".

The number of native speakers is unknown, but 1986 estimates suggests that there are fewer than 60,000 native and second language speakers combined.http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CR Origin and related creoles Limonese is very similar structurally and lexically to the Jamaican Creole spoken in Jamaica and Panama and to a lesser extent other English-based creoles of the region, such as Col√≥n Creole, M√≠skito Coastal Creole, Belizean Kriol, and San Andr√©s and Providencia Creole; many of these are also somewhat mutually intelligible to Limonese and each other. =Names= The name Mekatelyu is a transliteration of the phrase \\"make I tell you\\", or in standard English \\"let me tell you\\". In Costa Rica, one common way to refer to Limonese is by the term \\"patois\\", a word of French origin used to refer to provincial Gallo-Romance languages of France that were historically considered to be unsophisticated \\"broken French\\"; these include Proven√ßal, Occitan and Norman among many others. History Limonese developed from Jamaican Creole that was introduced to the Lim√≥n Province by Jamaican migrant workers who arrived to work on the construction of the Atlantic railway, the banana plantations and on the Pacific railway. During the Atlantic slave trade, British colonizers in Jamaica and elsewhere in the British West Indies delivered African slaves from various regions of Africa who did not speak a common language so various creoles developed to facilitate communication between them, largely influenced by slavers' English. Early forms of Limonese had to adjust for context that they were being used in so two language registers developed, one mutually intelligible to and heavily influenced by English for formal contexts and a common vernacular used among Limonese speakers in informal contexts. Modern day status Limonese is a regional language in Costa Rica and therefore does not have the official status in the country. There is controversy about what should be taught in Lim√≥n schools alongside Spanish, Limonese or Standard English. Proponents of Limonese education argue that education in it would conserve cultural identity and history of those African descendants, while proponents of English see English as a more vital option in a globalizing world where English is a lingua franca, emphasizing bilingualism in Spanish and English, two of most widely spoken languages in the world. Some linguists are undecided on the categorization of Limonese. According to some authors, Limonese should be treated as a separate language altogether while others contend that it is merely a part of a dialect continuum between English and Jamaican Patois. Limonese is documented to have been and is being gradually decreolized. See also *Bahamian Creole *Bajan *Bermudian English *Jamaican English Bibliography *Herzfeld, Anita.

The genus includes woad (Isatis tinctoria). Due to their extremely variable morphology, the Asian species in particular are difficult to determine; the only reliable diagnostic feature is the ripe fruit. They are (usually) biennial or perennial herbaceous plants, often bluish and hairless or downy hairy with the upright stem branched.H.

In: Flora (Elsevier) , Volume 205, 2010, pp. 337‚Äì343. Description They are annual, biennial or perennial, branched herbs, usually glabrous and glaucous except silicon. Basal leaves generally elliptic-oblong, sessile; sessile caulinary, rounded to oval-oblong. The hermaphrodite flowers are fourfold double perianth. The four sepals are ascending to upright. The four yellow to off-white or lilac-white petals are at least as long as the sepals. They have six stamens with very small, egg-shaped or elongated-round anthers. There are nectar glands. Racemose is branched or paniculated, ebracted, inflorescence, often reaching lax and elongated in the fruit. The fruit is a generally linear silicon, oblong-cuneate to suborbicular, indehiscent, flattened laterally, unilocular, little to conspicuously winged, glabrous or with tiny hairs.Flora of North America Editorial Committee, e. 2010.

The population of the Archipelago of San Andr√©s, Providencia and Santa Catalina uses three languages (Creole, English and Spanish). English remained in use for liturgical purposes in Baptist churches, but the coming of satellite television and growth of foreign tourism has revived the use of English on the islands. The standard English taught in schools is British English. The presence of migrants from continental Colombia and the travel of young islanders to cities like Barranquilla, Cartagena de Indias and Bogot√° for higher education, has contributed to the presence of Spanish. However, the interest in preserving the Creole has become very important for locals and Colombians in general. There has been an effort to offer multilingual education in San Andr√©s and Providencia which includes all three languages.Ronald Morren. 2010.

Beer is served in a range of locales, from neighbourhood shebeens to upscale bars. Many countries have standardized beer bottle sizes, which are cleaned and re- used, and so when buying beer at a store often people must pay a deposit on the bottle as well as the price of the beer. An alternative to glass-bottle beers is local beer sold in tetra-pak style paper cartons. South Africa consumes the most beer of any African country, with an average of 60 litres of beer consumed per person annually. Indigenous beers The brewing of traditional beer is a common practice among Africans in rural areas. Varieties and types of beer depend on local customs and resources. Among various beers brewed locally are ginger beers and honey beers. United National Breweries, amongst others, produces Johannesburg beer and the popular, if stigmatized, Chibuku beer is popular throughout Southern African countries. In South Africa and Botswana, sorghum malt is used as an important ingredient. Elsewhere, maize is the primary ingredient and the beer is more commonly known as opaque beer. Central Africa =Cameroon= The most popular brands are Castel and 33 Export, and in larger cities Beaufort, Beaufort Lite, M√ºtzig Lager, Guinness, Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, and Guinness Smooth can be found. Local brews include palm wine in the southern part of the country and millet beer called bil-bil in the north. =Congo (Brazzaville)= Ngok is a popular beer only available in Congo, which makes it a popular choice to sneak across the border to DRC. Its logo is a crocodile. =Congo (DRC)= Most beers in Congo (DRC) are brewed by Heineken with the most popular being Primus. = Gabon = R√©gab is the most widely distributed domestically brewed beer in Gabon. A bottle of R√©gab Eastern Africa = Ethiopia = (Also see Beer in Ethiopia) Beer has been widely consumed in Ethiopia for a while and as a result the country enjoys a variety of beer brands. Historically the most popular of these brands is St. George Beer (named after the country's patron saint) which is the country's oldest brewery, established in 1922. More recently the introduction of foreign beer brands like Heineken has created a lot of competition in the market, increasing investment in the farming sector. This influx of capital has led to the country to being more self-sufficient in such area as Malt production. Many traditional Ethiopian brands including Meta, Harar, and Bedele were acquired by Heineken's parent company and re- branded. St. George Beer Some of the best Ethiopian brands include: * Meta (·àú·â≥ ·â¢·à´) * Bedele (·â†·ã∞·àå ·â¢·à´) * Dashen (·ã≥·àΩ·äï ·â¢·à´) * Habesha (·àê·â†·àª ·â¢·à´) * Harar (·àê·à®·à≠ ·â¢·à´) * Walia Beer (·ãã·àç·ã´ ·â¢·à´) * Raya Beer (·à´·ã´ ·â¢·à´) * St. George Beer (·âÖ·ã±·àµ ·åä·ãÆ·à≠·åä·àµ ·â¢·à´) =Eritrea= Golden Star, brewed by the Golden Star Brewery, is the unique beer in Eritrea after the closing of Asmara Brewery (ex Melotti) which had been brewing beer since the colonial era. =Kenya= Tusker, brewed by the Kenya Breweries Limited, is the most-popular beer in Kenya. Popularly known as \\"Keroro\\" beer, Tusker is a source of Kenyan pride highlighted in the late 1990s, when East African Breweries waged a marketing war against Castle Breweries, a subsidiary of international brewing giant SABMiller. In this media campaign, Castle, which had constructed a multimillion-dollar brewery in the industrial town of Thika, was depicted as foreign and uncommitted to Kenya. The prolonged marketing wars came to an end in 2002, when the two brewers reached a settlement in which they divided the beer market in East Africa among themselves. Castle agreed to exit Kenya, and EABL decided to leave the Tanzanian market to the SABMiller subsidiary. =Tanzania= Beer (known as pombe in Swahili) is an integral part of Tanzanian society and local brands hold a strong sense of national pride and economic value. Tanzania is the sixth-largest per-capita consumer of beer in Africa. Over 90% of beer consumption is of homemade-style brews, however the most recognizable bottled brands include: A bottle of Kilimanjaro beer *Kilimanjaro Premium Lager (4.5%) *Serengeti Premium Lager (5.5%) *Ndovu Premium Malt (4.8%) *Uhuru Peak Lager (5.8%) *safari lager *Eagle *Chibuku =Rwanda= Rwanda has Primus Beer. Another brand is Virunga. Urwagwa is a beer made from fermented banana juice and sorghum flour. =Uganda= A southern Uganda beer is Nile Special, produced in and distributed from Jinja, the source of the Nile at Lake Victoria. Others are Club, Bell Lager, Eagle (the local beer made using sorghum), Guinness and Tusker. Northern Africa =Egypt= The leading local brand is called Stella (not to be confused with the Belgian Stella Artois). Other brands on the market include Meister, Luxor and Sakara, and the non-alcoholic Birell and Desperados. =Morocco= =Tunisia= A number of breweries or microbreweries operate in Tunisia. The largest is Celtia, located in Tunis. Southern Africa Chibuku Shake Shake, so-called by the need to shake the carton before drinking it, is a commercial umqombothi brewed by Chibuku, and remains a popular beer in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. Chibuku Shake Shake is made from a mix of sorghum and maize. In Zimbabwe it is known as \\"scud\\". It is sold in paper cartons or brown plastic containers with a wide blue lid. It is thought to be a drink for lower-class people. This thick brown millet beer costs less than a dollar and it is shaken vigorously before drinking it because of its thick layer of sediment collected on the bottom of the carton. It has a powerful yeast flavor that is offset by a lemony tang. Standard practice is to slurp any remaining sediment at the bottom of the container. =Botswana= Kgalagadi Breweries Limited, a subsidiary of SAB Miller, produces St Louis.

Biography Wallerius was born at Stora Mell√∂sa in N√§rke (now √ñrebro County), Sweden. He was a son of provost Erik Nilsson Wallerius and his spouse Elisabeth Tran√¶a . He was a younger brother to the physicist, philosopher and theologian Nils Wallerius (1706‚Äì1764). Johan Gottschalk entered Uppsala University in 1725, and graduated as magister in 1731 after studies of mathematics, physics and medicine. He continued his studies at Lund University, where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1735. After this graduation, he came back to Uppsala where he opened a course in chemistry in his laboratory.Uno Boklund, ‚ÄúWallerius, Johan Gottschalk‚Äù, Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, 2008. This course allowed students in pharmacy and chemistry to witness demonstrations and practice themselves with the experiments. The popularity of this teaching allowed Wallerius to become adjunct of medicine at Uppsala University in 1741 and the first holder of a new professorship of chemistry, medicine and pharmacy in 1750. The same year, Wallerius was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He retired from the chemistry chair in 1767 and was succeeded by his student Torbern Bergman (1735‚Äì1784). Wallerius is regarded as the founder of agricultural chemistry, mainly based on the significance of his widely disseminated work Agriculturae fundamenta chemica (1761, published in Swedish the same year as √Ökerbrukets chemiska grunder and later translated into many other languages).Translated into French in 1766: He published several other studies on chemical, mineralogical and geological subjects and used his own farm Hagelstena in Alsike (south of Uppsala) as an experimental field. He spent his early retirement from the University due to poor health applying the principles of chemistry as a way to improve agriculture in his own farm, and published some of his findings in R√∂n, r√∂rande landtbruket.

Quills from bird feathers were also occasionally used in quillwork. History Upper Missouri tribe by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, pre-1804. All natural dyes. Collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum Porcupine quillwork is an art form completely unique to North America. Before the introduction of glass beads, quillwork was a major decorative element used by the peoples who resided in the porcupine's natural habitat,Gillow and Sentance 223 which included indigenous peoples of the Subarctic, Northeastern Woodlands, and Northern Plains. The use of quills in designs spans from Maine to Alaska.Orchard Quillworking tools were discovered in Alberta, Canada and date back to the 6th century CE.Dubin 265 Cheyenne oral history, as told by Picking Bones Woman to George Bird Grinnell, says quilling came to their tribe from a man who married a woman, who hid her true identity as a buffalo. His son was also a buffalo. The man visited his wife and son in their buffalo home, and, while among the buffalo, the man learned the art of quilling, which he shared with the women of his tribe.Penney and Horse Capture 119 Joining the Cheyenne Quilling Society was a prestigious honor for Cheyenne women. Upon entering the Society, women would work first on quilling moccasins, then cradleboards, rosettes for men's shirts and tipis, and ultimately, hide robes and backrests. Porcupine quills often adorned rawhide and tanned hides, but during the 19th century, quilled birch bark boxes were a popular trade item to sell to European-Americans among Eastern and Great Lakes tribes. Quillwork was used to create and decorate a variety of Native American items, including those of daily usage to Native American men and women. These include clothing such as coats and moccasins, accessories such as bags and belts, and furniture attachments such as a cradle cover. Technique A quillwork knife sheath. Quills suitable for embellishment are two to three inches long and may be dyed before use. In their natural state, the quills are pale yellow to white with black tips. The tips are usually snipped off before use. Quills readily take dye, which originally was derived from local plants and included a wide spectrum of colors, with black, yellow, and red being the most common. By the 19th century, aniline dyes were available through trade and made dying easier.Feest 138 The quills can be flattened with specific bone tools or by being run through one's teeth. Awls were used to punch holes in hides, and sinew, later replaced by European thread, was used to bind the quills to the hides. The four most common techniques for quillwork are appliqu√©, embroidery, wrapping, and loom weaving.Feest 215 Appliqu√©d quills are stitched into hide in a manner that covers the stitches. In wrapping, a single quill may be wrapped upon itself or two quills may be intertwined. Quills can be appliqu√©d singly to form curvilinear patterns, as found on Odawa pouches from the 18th century.Vincent 15 This technique lends itself to floral designs popularized among northeastern tribes by Ursuline nuns. Huron women excelled at floral quillwork during the 18th and 19th centuries.Vincent 24 Plains quillwork is characterized by bands of rectangles creating geometrical patterns found also in Plains painting.Feest 140 Rosettes of concentric circles of quillwork commonly adorned historical Plains men's shirts, as did parallel panels of quillwork on the sleeves. These highly abstracted designs had layers of symbolic meaning. The Red River Ojibwe of Manitoba created crisp, geometric patterns by weaving quills on a loom in the 19th century.Vincent 28 and 43 Today Contemporary quillwork design on birch bark, by Ferdy Goode Quillwork never died out as a living art form in the Northern Plains. Some communities that had lost their quillwork tradition have been able to revive the art form. For instance, no women quilled in the Dene community of Wha Ti, Northwest Territories by the late 1990s. The Dene Cultural Institute held two workshops there in 1999 and 2000, effectively reviving quillwork in Wha Ti.Marie and Thompson, 29 The art form is very much alive today.

G. Hammar, (born 18 February 1943) is a Swedish clergyman. He was Archbishop of Uppsala, head of the Church of Sweden, from 1997 to 2006. During his tenure as archbishop he was a highly divisive figure, who gained strong support from some and drew heavy criticism from others, and he oversaw the separation of church and state in Sweden on 1 January 2000. He holds a PhD and is the author of several books on theology. Career His father a priest, he was ordained priest in the Diocese of Lund in 1965, at the age of 22. From 1972 to 1975 he worked as a teacher at Trinity Theological College in Singapore. He returned home to work as a priest in the Church of Sweden in Lund. In 1992, he became bishop and head of the diocese, and in 1997 he was appointed Archbishop by the Social Democrat-controlled Government of Sweden under the state church which was then still formally in place but lost its true standing already in 1958 and was on its way to be officially abolished. Soon after his appointment, he ordained Christina Odenberg, the first Swedish woman to become a bishop. Theological and political positions \\"I don¬¥t know the truth - I am just seeking it\\" \\\\- K.G. Hammar'' As the head of the church, he gained much popularity as well as criticism for his strong opinions, which emphasized humanism and tolerance according to his supporters, and was highly politically partisan and inappropriate for his position according to his critics, who saw him more as a left wing politician than a clergyman. He fought for extended amnesty for refugees and illegal immigrants in Sweden, debt relief for poor countries, more humane treatment of prisoners and tolerance towards followers of other religions than Christianity. He also criticised the invasion of IraqOmstridd och omtyckt √§rkebiskop avg√•r (Svt.se) and global capitalism, and urged for a boycott against goods from Israeli settlements.\\"Sluta att k√∂pa israeliska varor (DN.se) The former leader of the Swedish Christian Democrat party Alf Svensson has called Hammar a \\"leftist populist\\" and the then-party leader of the Moderate Party Bo Lundgren called on Hammar to either stop using his post as a political platform or to resign and stand for election as a leftist politician instead. Hammar is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. Hammar also expressed liberal theological views and spoke out frequently for the rights of homosexuals to adopt children. He drew much fire for sanctioning the showing of the controversial photo exhibition Ecce Homo inside Uppsala Cathedral, where photos recreated classical Christian motifs but in contexts relating to homosexuality. Hammar's liberal positions on several theological issues made him controversial among more conservative Christians. In an interview with Kyrkans Tidning, the Church of Sweden national magazine, he was quoted as saying: \\"You do not have to believe in anything particular to be a Christian. To say that you want to be part of it is enough. What kind of right do I have to question that? The definition frenzy only leads to exclusion\\", the context of the statement being how the church could open its door and welcome religious seekers and people who do not feel welcome in the church. He has also on other occasions stated that he thinks that the Virgin Birth should be interpreted as a ‚Äùpoetic statement‚Äù rather than a literal fact. His views on homosexuality and controversial theological issues sometimes stirred emotions among other Christian denominations. For example, the Church of Sweden's rather new-founded ecumenical contacts with the Roman-Catholic Church and its old contacts with the Anglican Communion were strained for a while, but have since gone back to normal. Hammar's theological position lies within a tradition of Christian mysticism and he has on several occasions expressed his gratitude to the writings of former U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld and his book Markings, and also to the Swedish poet laureate Tomas Transtr√∂mer. Stepping down On 25 August 2005 Hammar announced that he intended to step down from his post in the summer of 2006. He cited personal reasons, but declined to comment further. K. G. Hammar became a widower in 2007. He remarried in 2014, and has five adult children.

The most common is one's spoken language, but the term can also be used to refer to any narrative form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military signifiers in chess). Ferdinand de Saussure (1857‚Äì1913) emphasised that signs only acquire meaning and value when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning. Roman Jakobson (1896‚Äì1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see Semiosis). Discussion To that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to encode and decode the messages. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the denotational to the connotational, the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the modality of the medium, the style, e.g. academic, literary, genre fiction, etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a literal representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a metaphorical or allegorical interpretation diachronically. Distinctions of class or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an accent or as a dialect) or written (i.e. in sentences or in SMS format), the place of residence (see Americanisms), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating customs as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of socialisation is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an ideological quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current attitudes and beliefs. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs. The other code forms rely upon knowledge held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of vocabulary and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and ideological codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by Arnold Schoenberg and a piece of bubblegum pop, and a painting by Rembrandt and a comic book by Frank Miller, etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes. In communication research and media research, the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: * In \\"radical reading\\" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers. * In \\"dominant reading\\", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers. * In \\"subordinate reading\\" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makersDanesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications.

Located at the corner of the Bowery and Houston Street in Manhattan and running across to 2nd Avenue, it is now a part of New York City Parks Department.  History  The Liz Christy Bowery Houston Garden, originally named \\"Bowery-Houston Community Farm and Garden,\\" was established in 1973 when neighbor Liz Christy successfully petitioned the City of New York for access to make the vacant lot a garden for $1 a month. In 1973, Christy founded urban community garden group, the Green Guerrillas, and in 1974 led the group in cleanup and creation of the garden. The Liz Christy Bowery Houston Garden was the first winner of the American Forestry Association's Urban Forestry Award. In 1985, the garden was renamed in Christy's honor upon her death due to cancer. In 2002, it became one of the protected community gardens by law. In 2013, it was included in the Bowery Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.  The Garden  The garden feels like a private place despite the din of traffic with a varied terrain and mature trees and shrubs, and is maintained by approximately 20 volunteer gardeners. Magnolia and weeping birch trees are among the lush vegetation to be found there. Two ponds support fish and turtles, there is a perennial lotus, a native plant habitat, vegetables, herbs, and many flowering plants. The tallest Dawn Redwood tree in the city is located at the garden. The garden is open to the public on Saturday from noon until 4PM, all year, on Sundays from noon until 4 PM, May to October, and Tuesday & Thursday evenings from 6 p.m. until dusk from May until October.  Media  The garden is included in many broadcast programs, magazines and papers, it is also featured in the BBC series, \\"Around the World In 80 Gardens\\" with Monty Don.

The eldest child of Bob and Helen Parr (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl), Violet is born with the superhuman ability to render herself invisible, as well as generate force fields. Voiced by Sarah Vowell, Violet is a shy junior high school student who longs to fit in among her peers, a task she believes is hindered by her superpowers. Throughout the course of the films, Violet gradually matures and becomes more confident in herself as both a young woman and superhero. Created by screenwriter and director Brad Bird, Bird decided to grant Violet the ability to turn invisible because he felt that this specific superpower mirrors some of the challenges that teenage girls experience while growing up, namely insecurity and defensiveness. Bird cast Vowell as Violet upon listening to her contribute a real-life story about her father to the radio program This American Life, with Violet ultimately becoming Vowell's first voice-acting role. Vowell identified with the character's shy, sarcastic nature, in addition to observing similarities between Violet's relationship with Bob and her relationship with her own father. New computer technology was developed to animate Violet's long straight bluish-black hair, which animators identified as the most difficult component of The Incredibles since such a large quantity of hair had never been featured in a computer-animated film before. The character's hair serves as an important aspect of Violet's character development, which demonstrates her steady increase in self- confidence as she gradually ceases to hide her face behind it. Reception towards Violet has been positive, with film critics commending her character development and relatability, as well as Vowell's vocal performance. Critics have also heavily compared Violet to the comic book superheroine the Invisible Woman, whose superpowers she shares. The character's likeness has since been used in several tie-in media and merchandise associated with the films, including toys, books and video game adaptations.  Development  = Creation and casting = Screenwriter and director Brad Bird conceived Violet as \\"a teenage girl who just wants to be invisible\\". In early drafts of the screenplay, Violet was depicted as an infant as opposed to a teenager, since parents Bob and Helen Parr were originally intended to be introduced as retired superheroes who had just begun to attempt to live normal lives much earlier during the film. Violet is voiced by American author and actress Sarah Vowell, who related that she was offered the role unexpectedly. While beginning to cast the film's main characters, Bird had been listening to the National Public Radio program This American Life, to which Vowell is a frequent contributor. During one of Vowell's regular appearances on the show, Bird heard her contribute an anecdote about a cannon she had helped her father, a gunsmith, build. Bird wanted to cast Vowell based on her description of the event, deciding that she was \\"perfect\\" for the role, which he immediately called to offer her. Vowell had already earned a reputation for declining several voice acting jobs prior to The Incredibles, to the point at which her agent warned Bird not to waste his time. However, Vowell states that she simply avoided pursuing voice roles in general because she was content being a writer and found few animated projects particularly interesting prior to The Incredibles. alt= The animators animated a rough test sequence to some of Vowell's dialogue from the radio segment about her father's cannon, in which Violet is depicted being startled by a gun that repeatedly fires in her hands. Despite experiencing some hesitation due to having never voiced an animated character before, Vowell accepted the role after receiving an e-mail from the film's producer, agreeing to participate in The Incredibles because she believes that Pixar is consistently \\"the best at what they do\\", comparing the offer to politician Nelson Mandela \\"asking for your help to fight racism\\". She had also been a long-time fan of Bird's work as a filmmaker. Vowell ultimately accepted the role based on a sole image she had been sent of the character: a drawing of Violet surrounded by her schoolmates, all of whom appear to be happy and outgoing apart from Violet herself, who is instead hunched over and hiding behind her hair. Vowell concluded, \\"I can be that kid. I was that kid. I love that archetype of the morose, shy, smart-alecky teenage girl.\\" IndieWire contributor Oliver Lyttelton believes that Vowell was the most unexpected of Bird's casting decisions. Vowell has said that, like Violet, she herself \\"is a little smart-alecky and also has a weird dad with a strange hobby\\", finding the unique dynamic between Violet and Bob similar to her relationship with her own father, particularly the combination of affection, sarcasm and confusion that both she and her character feel towards their respective parents. Vowell expounded that she tends to resemble \\"a wise guy\\" in conversation with her father and believes that her tone of voice possibly influenced Bird's decision to cast her as a teenager. Vowell admitted that she shares Violet's \\"inability to stop pushing people's buttons\\", citing their tendency to voice their opinions about any given topic and gift for making various situations awkward as similarities. = Voice = Vowell found the recording process somewhat similar to working in radio, apart from the fact that the process required more standing, gesturing and working closely with a director. The film also required Vowell to deviate from her typically underplayed, deadpan delivery due to animation being broader in tone and demanding more \\"exclamation\\", identifying the process as more similar to stage than film acting because, like the former, \\"animation ... require[s] more and bigger things.\\" She revealed that voicing a teenage girl involved more acting than she had been expecting since she was \\"raised to be a stoic person.\\" For the scene in which Violet and her family's plane crashes into the ocean, Vowell drank from a water bottle while gurgling and gulping to simulate the sound of a person drowning. Despite using a towel as a bib, Vowell still got considerably wet during the process. Vowell found the process of producing non-verbal sounds such as laughing, yawning and screaming on cue to be the most difficult component of the job, a task that working in radio had hardly prepared her for. During her first recording session, the actress struggled to sound as though she had just been hurt and thus asked Bird to hit her arm to help her replicate the sound of being punched. Vowell recorded her character's screams closer towards the end of filming in order to preserve her voice, calling the process \\"fun\\" and claiming, \\"I don't think I had screamed ... for about 20 years\\" at that point. Vowell found the opportunity to voice a superheroine \\"thrilling\\" because she considers herself to be \\"more of a walking Woody Allen movie\\" in real life due to her fears of driving and swimming, joking that it is \\"fun to listen to my voice do things [in film] that ... it would never get to do.\\" Vowell also admitted that she tends to sound \\"cartoonish\\" and young for her age, elaborating that voicing Violet \\"lead[s] into some of my insecurities ... when you worry you sound like a cartoon and then someone sends me a message [asking] do I want to be in an animated movie ‚Ä¶ I guess I am who I am.\\" Bird maintains that Vowell \\"knocked it out of the park\\" with her performance, although Vowell claims that her acting required a lot of additional direction due to being less experienced, believing that Bird was drawn to \\"the extra challenge of an unformed performer.\\" Producer Nicole Paradis Grindle agreed that Vowell \\"genuinely thinks the way Brad [Bird] wants Violet to think\\", which contribute to her deliveries being \\"spot-on\\". Despite her success, Vowell maintains that she is not an actress, describing herself as merely \\"a writer moonlighting\\" as an actress for The Incredibles and insisting that she would be \\"mortified\\" if she were required to act in the presence of anyone apart from Bird, whose directing she trusts greatly, explaining, \\"I trust that he‚Äôll be able to find something in me or he‚Äôll be able to inspire something in me, and he‚Äôll also be able to find the take that is the best one.\\" Vowell stars in a documentary about her work in the film, Vowellet: An Essay by Sarah Vowell, which is included as a bonus feature on The Incredibles' 2004 DVD release. In the \\"video essay\\", Vowell discusses the various differences between voicing a superhero and becoming an action figure while she was writing about presidential assassinations, contrasting the two distinct careers. The animators also animated Violet to some of Vowell's dialogue from the documentary. Bird, who voices costume designer Edna Mode, was the only other actor Vowell recorded with while working on both films. The director would sometimes temporarily provide the voices of other characters for Vowell to act opposite of, such as Elastigirl in lieu of actress Holly Hunter. For Incredibles 2, Vowell had not been allowed to read to entire script while recording her dialogue, having only been allowed to preview small excerpts in which Violet is speaking or having conversations with other characters. Until watching the film for the first time, Vowell had been under the impression that Incredibles 2 would mostly be about Violet's anger at her father until experiencing the film's other storylines and characters. Despite 14 years separating the releases of the first and second films, Vowell did not find resuming the role to be difficult, identifying Violet as a character to whom she feels \\"closely tied\\", having played her for approximately one-third of her life. Syfy Wire's Heather Mason observed that Vowell shares her dry sense of humor with Violet. To-date, the Incredibles films remain Vowell's only animated film roles. = Personality and design = Bird had always been more interested in developing the personalities of the film's main characters than their superpowers. When it came time to determine the Parr family's powers, Bird decided to draw inspiration from the roles of typical nuclear family members, basing both their superpowers and personalities on these traditional archetypes. Describing Violet as \\"a typical teenager ... not comfortable in her own skin\\" who resides \\"in that rocky place between being a kid and an adult\\", Bird felt that invisibility would be the most suitable power for the Parr family's only daughter. Describing her as a young woman who would much prefer if other people avoided looking at her, Bird elaborated that some teenage girls are prone to feeling insecure and defensive, and thus gave her the abilities to become invisible and create protective shields. According to Vowell, Violet's superpowers of invisibility and force fields are, much like the rest of her family, \\"psychologically representational of who she is\\"; a teenage girl who longs to remain hidden and protected; the actress described her as a young woman \\"trapped between childhood and maturity, between self- confidence and insecurity\\" like many teenagers. Bird sought to balance the adventurous and \\"ordinary\\" components of the family's lives, explaining that audiences would appreciate and relate to moments when Violet uses her powers in the event that she feels humiliated. In terms of music, composer Michael Giacchino developed a theme for Violet that he described as \\"coy and mysterious\\". Although the films are set roughly during the 1950s and 1960s, shading art director Bryn Imagire opted to incorporate a more modern style into Violet's wardrobe, feeling that the hourglass silhouette, poofy skirts and tight shirts young women typically wore during this time period were not as suitable for the character due to her shy, withdrawn personality and hairstyle. Although the animators admitted to using mid-century fashion \\"as a jumping-off point\\", they deliberately designed Violet's clothes to be more baggy in appearance with a \\"very desaturated\\" color scheme, incorporating a variety of cut-off jeans, sneakers and sweaters into her attire to compliment her rebellious personality. Furthermore, the majority of the character's clothing during the first film are variations of the color purple, alluding to her name. Violet was costumed in a pink shirt towards the end of the film in order to demonstrate that she is now \\"much more open‚Äì sort of like she‚Äôs blossoming as a teenager.\\" Imagire identified the character as \\"the perfect example of where we didn‚Äôt go mid-century; we went modern with her\\" instead. For the sequel, the increasing complexity of Violet's force fields required the animators to create new effects; although they remain visually similar to the first film, Violet \\"is able to do more with her force fields, so we had to figure out how that changes the look of her force fields,\\" including sound effects and static as they interact with other objects, according to effects supervisor Bill Watral. = Hair = The Incredibles required the use of computer technology that was particularly advanced for its time, some of which computers had not yet been \\"taught\\". Computers were used to simulate hair movement and determine where hair was intended to be placed on the film's respective characters. Described as a new and time-consuming process at the time, new programs and approaches were developed and implemented to assist the animators in animating Violet's long straight bluish-black hair. Since organic materials are still considered to be among the most challenging objects to animate in computer animation, Violet's hair proved to be the most difficult subject for the animators to master. Although scale models of Violet and the film's major characters were first sculpted in clay by artist Kent Melton, the animators initially struggled to replicate Melton's very detailed interpretation of Violet's hair. According to hair and cloth simulation supervisor Mark Henne, Violet's hair remained an \\"unsolved research project\\" for much of the film's production due to its type and length, which had never been featured in a computer animated film prior to The Incredibles. For the majority of the film's production, Violet's character model was entirely bald. Producer John Walker frequently pleaded with the animators to give the character some form of hair, to which they would respond, \\"the hair is still theoretical\\"; it remained as such until significantly late into completion. Vowell recalled seeing only a bald iteration of her character for most of her recording process. Technical director Rick Sayre explained that the challenges revolving around Violet's hair were rooted in the fact that she has \\"no fixed hair style\\"; her hair constantly adopts new shapes and forms as it interacts with other objects, including other strands of her own hair, as well as her own body. Despite its challenges, the filmmakers resisted temptation to give the character a shorter, more manageable hairstyle, insisting on keeping Violet's hair long because its length plays an integral role in her story arc; Violet \\"is all about the fact that she hides behind her long straight bluish- black hair ... It‚Äôs such a crucial part of the character that we had to get it right.\\" Violet is also the only member of her family to have bluish-black hair; her father, mother and younger brother each have blonde, brown and blonde hair, respectively. Bird explained that Violet's hair color is the result of a recessive gene. Violet's hair required animators a total of six months to fully render. Henne and the animators sculpted five different hairstyles for the character to be used during various moments in the film, which were modified and adjusted accordingly to suit different circumstances and environmental conditions such as rain, wind and the zero-gravity effects of her own force fields. Ultimately, Violet's hair became one of the film's greatest accomplishments, which Sayre has since deemed \\"a significant advance in showing hair move in a believable manner while retaining its stylistic look ... no one had ever animated this kind of hair before for a CG film.\\" The difficulty surrounding Violet's hair ultimately influenced Mirage's hairstyle, which was originally quite long until Sayre begged the filmmakers to adopt it into a shorter and \\"cooler\\" variation due to the amount of time and effort that had already been spent on creating Violet's hair. Due to the technological advancements that computer animation has undergone since the original film was released, for the sequel animators were able to revisit and replicate Melton's more intricate, original design for Violet's hair, which \\"flows much more freely\\" in Incredibles 2. Despite these achievements, however, simulation supervisor Tiffany Erickson Klohn admitted that animating the character's hair remained challenging due to its requirement to be \\"silky and straight\\" but be subject to \\"some breakup\\" during action-oriented sequences, combined with the fact that Violet has a larger head despite being small in frame, meaning that \\"there's very little for her hair to rest on\\" when she moves. According to character art director Matt Nolte, the filmmakers agreed that Violet's hair would be worn back entirely for the sequel to emphasize \\"that she's not scared anymore.\\"  Characterization and themes  = Insecurity, introversion and sarcasm = Originally depicted as a shy, timid and socially withdrawn girl, Violet finds it difficult to fit in among her peers and thus prefers to remain unnoticed. According to Alissa Wilkinson of Rolling Stone, the character's longing \\"to hide is familiar to virtually anyone who's ever been an awkward\\" teenager. Film critic Roger Ebert observed that the superhero life occasionally proves to be \\"too much\\" for Violet; she longs to be normal like her peers despite the fact that she is anything but, originally insisting that youngest brother Jack-Jack is the only \\"normal\\" member of her family since the infant had yet to exhibit signs of having superpowers. She has a tendency to hide behind her long black hair, which initially conceals most of her face for much of the film. She wears dark colors, representing the fact that she can be a particularly moody character. At times her appearance and dark-colored wardrobe have been described as \\"goth\\"; Mark Halverson of Sacramento News & Review wrote that \\"Violet hides behind a goth persona when not using her invisibility or force field to repel human contact.\\" A writer for IGN likened the way in which Violet's hair drapes across her face to actress Veronica Lake. However, she grows more confident in both herself and her abilities as the film progresses, eventually emerging from behind her hair, using a headband to wear her it back and adopting a more colorful wardrobe. Grindle explained that the character successfully \\"turned a corner at the end of the first movie\\" to the point of which she is finally able to ask her crush on a date, which she partially attributes to her beginning to believe in herself as a result of fighting crime alongside her family. Violet is 14 years-old, weighs approximately 90 pounds and is 4‚Äô6 tall. According to the character's official character description in press releases for Incredibles 2, Violet is socially awkward, outspoken, sarcastic, intelligent and reserved, while Pixar's website describes her as \\"a typical shy, insecure teenage girl stuck at the crossroads between child and woman.\\" Maiden USA: Girl Icons Come of Age author Kathleen Sweeney dubbed the character a \\"shrinking violet\\" who has a tendency to mumble and come off as angry. Similarly describing her as a shrinking violet, ReelViews' James Berardinelli observed that Violet \\"has entered that gawky stage of life when her body becomes uncomfortable to inhabit.\\" Identifying her as an \\"oral character\\", John Kundert-Gibbs, author of Action!: Acting Lessons for CG Animators, Violet's main arc revolves around transitioning \\"from being invisible to visible to others.\\" According to Daphne Carr, author of Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine, Violet adheres to \\"the archetype of the introverted, introspective artist-type kid.\\" Oliver Lyttelton of IndieWire believes that Violet has more in common with actress Thora Birch's character Enid in the film Ghost World (2001) than most teenage girls. Observing that Bird approached the character designs in a manner that is \\"less cute\\" and more edgy than previous Pixar characters, Jeff Otto of IGN likened Violet to the goth teenager Lydia Deetz (Winona Ryder) from the film Beetlejuice (1988). In Incredibles 2, female characters contribute a more central role to the plot, with Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter observing that Violet has begun \\"to spread her wings\\". However, she remains an awkward teenage girl \\"with the power to make herself invisible (although not, sadly, to make the boy she has a crush on really see her)\\", according to Slate's Sam Adams, with the film exploring her \\"adolescent, boy-crazed sanity\\" and first broken heart, to which she reacts by consuming ice cream and throwing her clothes. At times, Violet can be so concerned with her own struggles that she fails to notice some of the situations that are affecting the rest of her family, although she maintains the importance of family. Vowell observed that Violet's temper is explored much further in Incredibles 2, in which she cries and yells out of annoyance and passion, summarizing the character as \\"a hormonal teenager.\\" The actress believes that her character \\"can be hilarious\\" at times, \\"but her humor has some bite to it ... She has a tendency to comment a little too truthfully about any given scenario ... For better or worse, if she thinks it, she says it\\", describing Violet as incapable of \\"edit[ing] uncomfortable thoughts.\\" According to Syfy Wire's Heather Mason, Violet's role in the sequel is to \\"break the tension and bring the superheroes back to reality\\" by \\"say[ing] what they are all thinking.\\" Much like her brother, she often chafes against her mother's insistence that her family refrain from using their powers in an attempt to live like \\"normal\\" humans. At the same time, however, Violet and Dash are opposites in the sense that while Violet initially dislikes having superpowers, Dash, who possesses superhuman speed, is \\"in love\\" with his own abilities, thus the siblings constantly bicker about their differences. = Powers and abilities = Violet is born with the superhuman abilities to render herself invisible and create force fields, the latter of which she is still attempting to master at the beginning of The Incredibles. Her superpowers mirror the personality of an awkward teenager who dislikes attention and would rather avoid being looked at, as well as her insulated, protective nature. According to The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott, Violet's powers \\"serve mainly as metaphors for her shyness and disconnection.\\" Several journalists agree that Violet's abilities resemble the desires of most teenage girls. Vowell herself explained that her character's powers \\"reflect a female teen's occasional desires to protect herself, block out the world and avoid scrutiny or surveillance.\\" Violet uses her powers both in battle and to hide during uncomfortable situations, such as when she encounters Tony Rydinger, a schoolmate on whom she harbors a crush. This behavior establishes the character as a social outcast. Las Vegas Weekly's Josh Bell identified Violet's invisibility as \\"the physical manifestation of the effects of peer pressure.\\" The Incredibles follows Violet as she learns to control her powers. Violet's low self-esteem manifests in the use of her superpowers to the point at which she resents having them, as demonstrated when she struggles to create a force field large enough to shield her family's jet from missiles at her mother's insistence. Kundert-Gibbs attributes Violet's ineptitude to lack of energy, which the author believes is also reflected in her straight, flat hair and slouching posture. However, Sweeney argues that Violet's inability to suddenly summon a force field of such magnitude is due to the fact that she is still unaccustomed to her powers, the use of which she had long been denied prior. After rescuing herself and her children, Helen apologizes to Violet for pressuring her to perform such a large feat, but at the same time warns Violet that they can no longer afford to doubt their abilities, assuring her daughter that she has hidden potential and \\"When the time comes you'll know what to do. It's in your blood.\\" IGN identified Helen's speech as female empowering, while Vowell cited the scene as a \\"dramatic\\" moment in which Violet dons her mask and truly \\"becomes a hero\\" for the first time, elaborating that the character evolves significantly \\"in terms of really discovering ... and developing her powers\\". Violet eventually learns to embrace her abilities. According to Sweeney, Violet transforms from a shrinking violet into \\"Ultra-Violet\\" by the end of the film, while Mic's Kevin O'Keeffe wrote that Violet uses \\"invisibility while growing out of her own wallflower sensibility.\\" Salon film critic Stephanie Zacharek opined that Violet slowly \\"discovers that, when she really tries, she can build a force-field bubble that protects her whole family\\". Tor.com's Mari Ness believes that Violet's gradual acceptance of her powers reinforces that \\"happiness comes only after people embrace the extraordinary\\". Vowell observed that by the sequel, Violet has consequently become skilled and confident to the point at which she starts enjoying her powers, \\"so as the new film starts, she wants more. She wants to use her powers. She wants to be out there.\\" Violet ultimately grows incapable of resisting the temptation to fight crime alongside her family. Violet can use her power of invisibility to render herself either wholly or partially invisible at will. Able to turn invisible rather quickly, the Richmond Times- Dispatch's Mike Ward joked that the character s capable of disappearing faster than the short-lived 2004 presidential campaign of politician John Kerry. Edna designs a super suit for Violet that automatically turns invisible whenever she does. Violet's force fields consist of psychic energy, as they are created using her mind. Her fields sometimes demonstrate an anti-gravitational effect on the objects they surround, and can be used to deflect heavy oncoming artillery. Typically spherical, she can use them to surround both herself and anyone she is willing to protect. Improving her abilities over the course of the films, Violet becomes skilled to the point at which she can perform significantly more feats with her fields, capable of manipulating them to create various effects. Wilkinson believes that Violet is the most talented member of her family. Hypable contributor Aaron Locke agreed that Violet \\"feels like the Super with the most potential\\", particularly in Incredibles 2. However, a particularly heavy, blunt force can potentially cause the wall of her shield to collide with her upon impact and dissipate, leaving her vulnerable to attacks. According to Ottawa Life Magazine, Violet uses her force fields more often than her invisibility, although both powers have proven useful; in the first film, she uses both powers to battle hovercrafts and Syndrome's robot. Additionally, Violet has also been identified as highly intellectual. Violet's superpowers are very similar to those of the Invisible Woman (Susan Storm-Richards), a Marvel Comics superheroine and founding member of the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Fans of the film quickly identified similarities between the two characters when the first film was released in 2004. Contributing to IGN, comic book historian Peter Sanderson identified Violet's powers as \\"The real giveaway of the F. F.'s influence on The Incredibles\\". Similar to classic Marvel superheroes, the character is under the impression that her powers make her different from most people, and considers herself to be an outsider as a result of this. According to Eric Lichtenfeld, author of Action Speaks Louder: Violence, Spectacle, and the American Action Movie, the character has also demonstrated the ability to manipulate the energy produced by her force fields, much like the comic book superheroine.  Appearances  = Films = Violet debuted in The Incredibles (2004) as the first-born child and only daughter of Bob and Helen Parr, a pair of retired superheroes known to the world as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. The character has two younger brothers: Dash and Jack-Jack. A junior high school student with the superhuman abilities to turn invisible and create force fields, Violet is shy and insecure, and would much rather be a \\"normal\\" teenager, finding it difficult to fit in among her peers. Helen resumes superhero work in search of Bob, and Violet stows away with Dash onto the jet that their mother is piloting towards Syndrome's private island. When the jet is attacked by Syndrome's missiles, Violet fails to create a force field large enough to protect its passengers at her mother's insistence; the plane is downed and the family becomes stranded on Syndrome's island. Helen leaves Violet and Dash hidden in a cave, encouraging Violet to use her powers whenever necessary. Violet and Dash are eventually pursued by Syndrome's henchmen, forcing her to use her powers to defend herself and her brother for the first time; she begins to realize her full potential while striving to master her abilities, which she had been largely suppressing prior. Violet is instrumental in helping her family escape Syndrome's lair, using a force field to interfere with the electromagnetic fields that are imprisoning them, before returning to Metroville where she teams up with her family to defeat Syndrome's robot. Once Jack-Jack is rescued from Syndrome, Violet uses a force field to protect her family from the debris falling from Syndrome's destroyed jet. At Dash's sports meet, Violet finally musters the courage to ask Tony out on a date. Violet appears in the film's sequel Incredibles 2 (2018), in which she receives more screen time. The film follows Violet as she struggles with being a teenager and a superhero simultaneously, resuming shortly after Violet and Tony have agreed to go on their first date. Tony witnesses Violet and her family battling The Underminer, discovering that Violet is a superhero when she unknowingly removes her mask in his presence, prompting him to run away. Violet protects her family from The Underminer by creating her most powerful force field to-date. Despite limiting the destruction of the villain, superheroes remain illegal, and the Parrs remain prohibited to use their powers, which frustrates Violet. Government agent Rick Dicker erases Tony's memories of the event and inadvertently wipes Tony's memory of Violet altogether, forcing Violet to come to terms with the consequences. Violet's storyline revolves around her struggling with teenage angst, boys, dating and adolescence, while mother Helen, who has been recruited by a pair of entrepreneurs in order to repair superheroes' public image in the hopes of legalizing them again, leaves Violet and her siblings in Bob's charge, who becomes challenged with parenting Violet, attempting to make her feel better as she explores her teenage romance. Although initially resentful towards Bob for the fact that Dicker erased Tony's memories of her to the point of which she \\"renounces\\" her superhero heritage, Violet eventually offers assistance upon realizing how much effort her father is putting into raising his children. At the end of the film, Violet simply re-introduces herself to Tony. Just as the characters are about to begin their first date, Violet postpones it so that she can help her family fight criminals instead, promising to rejoin him afterward. = Merchandise = Violet has made several appearances in other media, with Vowell returning to voice the character in various media tie-ins and merchandise, including toys and cell phones. =Video games= Among the video games in which Violet appears is the original 2004 video game based on the film, Violet appears mostly in stealth missions, using her invisibility to maneuver past guards and enemies unnoticed. The character's invisibility is limited by her Incredi-Meter, which can become greatly depleted by the use of her powers. In later levels, players can combine the powers of Violet and Dash to create the Incredi-Ball, in which Violet surrounds both herself and Dash using a force field, and Dash runs within it to propel it forward. The Incred-Ball has been identified as virtually indestructible. On some platforms, Violet is able to use force fields to levitate other objects. In a negative review, Alex Navarro of GameSpot described Violet's levels as arguably \\"the worst the game has to offer\\" due to time limits that restrict her invisibility, making it \\"difficult to gauge when a guard will or won't notice you.\\" Similarly, Eurogamer's Patrick Garratt wrote that younger children will find playing as Violet increasingly difficult to due to the character's tendency to \\"run out of Incredible Power juice\\" quickly, limiting her ability to \\"sneak her way to the end of the level,\\" while Duke Ferris of Game Revolution found the character's stealth levels to be \\"particularly weak\\". The Incredibles: When Danger Calls (2004) features 10 minigames that revolve around Violet and the rest of her family, particularly using Violet's powers to avoid difficult situations. The characters are first played as their secret identifies before players unlock levels in which they can then be played as their superhuman alter egos. There are two minigames that revolve around Violet and her abilities. In the first, \\"Violet's Diary Drama\\", she projects force fields to intercept Dash and prevent him from stealing her belongings, while \\"Violet Surrounded\\" features the character using a force field to protect herself from oncoming projectiles and deflect them back at Syndrome's henchmen. In Kinect Rush: A Disney Pixar Adventure (2012), players explore six worlds based on various Pixar films, pairing them with Violet in some of the Incredibles-themed levels to navigate around hazards and obstacles. Violet is available as an add-on figurine for Disney Infinity (2013), sharing her abilities from the film (her force fields are identified as \\"plasma shields\\" in the game). When utilized, the character becomes a player character, and can be used in Toy Box mode, The Incredibles play set and her own adventure Violet's Stealth Mission, in which the player uses Violet to retrieve as many collectibles as possible while remaining undetected by spotlights within a limited timeframe. Violet appears as a player character alongside her family in Lego The Incredibles (2018), in which her force fields can be used to intercept laser security systems. In early levels, Violet unites with Elastigirl and Dash to rescue Mr. Incredible from Syndrome; the titular family most often works together in order to overcome obstacles, such as Violet levitating over poisonous substances to assist Dash. =Comics and books= In 2004 Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue comics miniseries, The Incredibles, written by director Brad Bird and Paul Alden, and drawn by Ricardo Ruiz and Ram√≥n K. P√©rez. It was collected in a trade paperback published in 2005.\\"The Incredibles\\". Grand Comics Database. Retrieved March 13, 2019. In early 2009 Boom! Studios published the four-issue comics miniseries The Incredibles: Family Matters by writer Mark Waid and artist Marcio Takara.

Various artists illustrated the title during its 15-issue run, which was collected in four trade paperbacks. The series holds a rating of 8.0 out of 10 on the review aggregator website Comic Book Round Up.\\"Incredibles\\". Comic Book Round Up. Retrieved March 13, 2019. In 2004, a children's book based on The Incredibles was published entitled The Incredibles: Violet's Incredible Diary, written by children's author Richard Dungworth. Described as \\"Violet's side of the story\\", the book follows the film albeit written from Violet's perspective in the form of a diary.  Reception  = Critical response = Violet has garnered positive reviews from film critics. The Washington Post's Jennifer Frey described Violet as \\"instantly familiar as the teenage girl who pines for the cute boy, fights with her little brother and is so uncertain of herself\\". In addition to appreciating Pixar's decision to cast the lesser-known Vowell, Joshua Tyler of CinemaBlend dubbed Violet his \\"favorite character\\" in The Incredibles, praising her many \\"goose-bump worthy moments as she starts to accept who she is.\\" Commending the multidimensionality of the film's characters, Hollywood.com's Julia Emmanuele observed that, through Violet, audiences \\"understand how awkward and insecure being a teenager can be, even without the addition of superpowers.\\" Vulture.com's Abraham Riesman described Vowell's voice acting as \\"terrific\\". In addition to praising Vowell's performance, Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that her character ultimately \\"emerges as the most sympathetic member of the family\\". In a retrospective review, Jonathon Dornbush of IGN cited \\"Violet‚Äôs sense of isolation and misunderstanding\\" among the main reasons The Incredibles remains \\"a deeply relatable, enduring film\\" and \\"one of Pixar's best\\". Slate film critic David Edelstein acknowledged the difficulty of animating Violet's hair while calling her ability to create force fields \\"to die for\\". Germain Lussier of io9 deemed Violet as \\"arguably [one of] the best parts of Incredibles 2,\\" writing that her \\"journey through adolescence not only gives her a great arc, but some truly hilarious and embarrassing moments too.\\" The Globe and Mail's Barry Hertz found Violet's design and animation particularly impressive, likening the scene in which she dries her hair to \\"glimpsing the future of animation, where the real and the unreal fold into each other.\\" Patricia Puentes of CNET found Violet's role in the film to be empowering for teenage girls, praising the character's decisions to re-introduce herself to Tony and ultimately choose to fight crime over their date, concluding, \\"This teenage girl prefers to go catch some bad guys -- because she's a hero and that's her calling -- over having a date with the guy she likes.\\" The Ringer editor Juliet Litman identified Violet as \\"a galvanizing force\\" in the sequel, crediting her with \\"propelling the plot in crucial moments and injecting raw emotion into the\\" otherwise comedic film. Litman also commended Vowell for recognizing \\"The precise balance of the serious and lighthearted[ness]\\" required for her role, concluding that it has become difficult to imagine Violet voiced by any other actress. Syfy Wire writer Kristy Puchko described Violet's reaction to being stood up by Tony as \\"all too familiar\\". Writing for Vulture.com, Edelstein called it \\"wonderful to hear Sarah Vowell and her euphonious quack as the irritable Violet,\\" describing the character as \\"the quintessential brilliant but ever-stricken and angry teenage girl.\\" The New Yorker's Anthony Lane wrote that Vowell \\"still provides the pitch and yaw of adolescent speech‚Äînow tetchy, now timid, but touched here and there with a determination that might just save the day.\\" Some critics complained that the character was underused in the sequel. CNET contributor Mike Sorrentino wrote that the film's emphasis on Helen and Bob results in Violet being \\"relegated to the sidelines for most of the film\\", while Screen Daily's Tim Grierson wrote that the character's \\"awkward dating woes all streak by too quickly.\\" For Screen Rant, Molly Freeman observed that the character's arc \\"largely exist[s] to serve Bob's own storyline\\". Writing that while Violet's storyline offered \\"a great deal of potential\\" by \\"exploring how a child with superpowers growing up in a world where superheroes are illegal could affect her sense of self\\", Freeman criticized it for being \\"boiled down to either focusing on her dating life or providing a challenge for Bob to overcome.\\" However, the critic acknowledged that Violet is provided with several opportunities \\"to demonstrate [her] visually compelling superpowers.\\" = Accolades = Vowell's performance and character have proven to be particularly popular among young women and teenager girls, from whom she continues to receive positive feedback. Cosmic Book News crowned Violet \\"the teen-queen of sarcasm\\", while Michelle Lima of Oh My Disney wrote that the character boasts \\"some seriously amazing sarcasm skills.\\" Ana Luisa Suarez of Hollywood.com considers Violet's sarcasm to be among \\"15 Reasons Why 'The Incredibles' Is The Best Superhero Movie\\". Rolling Stone ranked Violet the 20th \\"Best Pixar Movie Character\\", ahead of Mr. Incredible (24th), with author Alissa Wilkinson calling her \\"super-smart ... which makes the moment when she finally transforms into a confident superheroine ... that much more delightful.\\" Hypable ranked Violet the third best Incredibles 2 superhero, with author Aaron Locke writing, \\"It would be great to see Violet take on an investigation of her own.\\" Pajiba ranked Violet Pixar's ninth best female character. IndieWire ranked Vowell's work as Violet Pixar's 19th greatest performance, writing that her \\"quirky tones perfectly captures the kind of girl who wishes she could (and in this case actually can) fade into the background,\\" continuing, \\"the way she eventually finds her own voice is one of the most moving aspects of the film.\\" Similarly, The Playlist also ranked Vowell's performance 19th. The Cinemaholic ranked The Incredibles the third best film featuring invisible characters, with author Clarisse Tenreiro writing that Violet \\"possesses perhaps the coolest power of\\" the film's characters. In 2017, Violet served as inspiration behind the BBC article \\"Can a 'superpower force field' protect us from hackers?\\", in which technology writer Matthew Wall likened cybersecurity firm Bromium anti-malware software to the character's abilities several times.

In 2013 the club had 790 registered members. =GAA= The local GAA team, St Peters Dunboyne GAA, won the Meath Senior Football Championship championship in 1998, 2005 and 2018. Dunboyne man Se√°n Boylan was the longest-serving county manager in GAA history and led Meath to four All Ireland victories in 1987, 1988, 1996 and 1999. Since its foundation in 1996, Dunboyne Ladies GFC remains the only standalone Ladies Gaelic football club in Meath. Dunboyne Ladies GFC have won Meath Championships several times in all under age levels up to and including Under 21s. =Motor racing= Dunboyne was a motor racing venue between 1958 and 1967 for both cars and motorbikes. The racing circuit was a 4 mile long triangular shaped circuit with a combination of fast straights and hairpin bends. The start/finish line was in the centre of Dunboyne village and the racing circuit itself consisted of public roads around the village. During these years races such as the Leinster Trophy, Dunboyne Trophy and Holmpatrick Trophy were held. =Football= Dunboyne has two football clubs, Dunboyne FC and Dunboyne AFC. Dunboyne AFC's grounds are on the Summerhill Road which has a floodlit astro turf pitch, three 11 a-side pitches, two small-sided pitches, club shop, and clubhouse. Dunboyne FC plays in the Phoenix Park. They were both officially opened by Pele in November 2009 in recognition of the club receiving the FAI Club of the Year award for 2009. =Other sports= The GUI National Golf Academy is located 5 km outside Dunboyne on the Maynooth Road. It has a driving range, putting green and short game area. There is also a golf society in Dunboyne.

Education =Primary schools= Primary schools serving the area include Dunboyne Junior Primary School, Dunboyne Senior Primary School, Gaelscoil Thulach na n√ìg and St Peter's National School (Church of Ireland). In 2002 the headmaster at Gaelscoil Thulach na n√ìg was dismissed by the board of patrons for writing a letter to the parents of the children which was deemed by the Board of Management to be misconduct. The parents of the school were divided on the issue, with some reportedly believing that the incident was unfairly represented in the press. =Post-primary= The local secondary school is St. Peter's College. Dunboyne College of Further Education, located in Dunboyne Business Park, provides full-time courses at FETAC level 5. It is for PLC. The college operates under the authority of the County Meath Vocational Education Committee.

The aim of the club is to promote the Irish language. Approximately 50 students participate in the club, which takes place from September to May. For√≥ige, an English speaking youth club, meets on Friday nights. Dunboyne Community Centre In 1985 a public meeting was held in Dunboyne, and it was agreed that a social and recreational centre was needed. Four years of fund-raising followed, and over ¬£400,000 was raised. The Irish government contributed grants totalling ¬£35,000, and a community centre was opened by then-President of Ireland, Dr Patrick Hillery, in 1989. With the establishment of St Peter's College on the adjoining site in 1994, the opportunity arose to undertake a venture which subsequently became a model for school/community ventures elsewhere in Ireland. The money that would have been spent on putting sports facilities into the college, ¬£280,000, was instead invested in the centre. Through further fund-raising, the committee added another ¬£150,000 to this and the result was a major extension of the building in 1997. This arrangement provided the college with a larger sports hall than it otherwise would have had while, outside of school hours, the extension enabled the centre to cater to the growing community better. Health and fitness facilities were added in early 2000, and a floodlit all-weather pitch (another joint venture with St Peter's College), whose development began in 2003. Transport =Road= Dunboyne is situated primarily on the Station Road (L2228) Regional Road, at the intersection of the Maynooth Road (L2227) The town also lies parallel with the M3 motorway, which connects to L2228 using the R157 at a roundabout west of the town. =Rail= There are two rail stations in Dunboyne. Dunboyne railway station, which was built to service the town and is situated to the east of the town and M3 Parkway railway station which was built to service commuters using the M3 coming down from Navan. They were built as part of the reopening of the Navan-Clonsilla line under the Irish Governments Transport 21 development programme. However, due to a lack of funding, this railway stops after the M3 Parkway railway station just outside of Dunboyne. The original Dunboyne railway station was opened on 29 August 1862 and closed on 1 April 1963. =Bus= Dunboyne is served by three bus routes: the 70 and 70d (operated by Dublin Bus) and 270 (operated by Go- Ahead Ireland). There is also a limited Bus √âireann service to/from Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells on route 109 and to Mullingar, Killucan, Rathmolyon and Summerhill on route 118. Bus √âireann route 109 provides two journeys a day in the morning to Kells via Dunshaughlin and Navan and two return journeys in the evening. No Bus √âireann services serve Dunboyne on Sundays. Bus √âireann route 111 between Dublin and Athboy stops at the M3 parkway station, just outside Dunboyne. Geography The Castle River flows into the Tolka river and flooding in and around Dunboyne has been attributed to problems further down the Tolka. Alleviation works have resulted in the risk of flooding being lessened. The last major flood was in 2002, preceded by a flood in 2000. On 11 May 2007, the town was hit by a small tornado in which slates were torn from roofs and branches from trees during a brief storm. In media The 1970s television series, The Riordans, set in the fictional townland of Leestown, was filmed in Dunboyne.

The goal of the project, started in 1991, is to develop a highly portable, yet efficient, operating system for massively parallel-distributed memory systems.--a paper that explains what SUNMOS is (CiteSeer cached copy) SUNMOS uses a single-tasking kernel and does not provide demand paging. It takes control of all nodes in the distributed system. Once an application is loaded and running, it can manage all the available memory on a node and use the full resources provided by the hardware. Applications are started and controlled from a process called yod that runs on the host node. Yod runs on a Sun frontend for the nCUBE 2, and on a service node on the Intel Paragon. SUNMOS was developed as a reaction to the heavy weight version of OSF/1 that ran as a single-system image on the Paragon and consumed 8-12 MB of the 16 MB available on each node, leaving little memory available for the compute applications. In comparison, SUNMOS used 250 KB of memory per node. Additionally, the overhead of OSF/1 limited the network bandwidth to 35 MB/s, while SUNMOS was able to use 170 MB/s of the peak 200 MB/s available. The ideas in SUNMOS inspired PUMA, a multitasking variant that only ran on the i860 Paragon. Among the extensions in PUMA was the Portals API, a scalable, high performance message passing API. Intel ported PUMA and Portals to the Pentium Pro based ASCI Red system and named it Cougar. Cray ported Cougar to the Opteron based Cray XT3 and renamed it Catamount. A version of Catamount was released to the public named OpenCatamount. In 2009, the Catamount lightweight kernel was selected for an R&D; 100 Award.

Her heir- presumptive is her next sister, Princess Elena of Romania. According to the defunct royal constitutions of 1923 and 1938, women were barred from wearing the crown, and Margareta and her sisters would not be in the line of succession to the throne. On 30 December 2007, \\"Princess Margarita, heir to the throne of Romania,\\" Evenimentul Zilei, 30 December 2007 King Michael designated Margareta as heir presumptive to the defunct throne by an act that is not recognized by the Romanian government and lacks legal validity without approval by Romania's Parliament. \\"The King and Margareta ‚Äì On The \\"Day of the Republic\\" The King Designated His Successor\\" , Jurnalul National, 2 January 2008 \\"The Actor Duda in The Role of A Lifetime: Prince Consort of Romania,\\" Cotidianul, 3 January 2008 On the same occasion, Michael also requested that, should the Romanian Parliament consider restoring the monarchy, the Salic law of succession not be reinstated, allowing female succession. According to the new statute of the Romanian Royal House as declared by Michael, no illegitimate descendants or collateral lines may claim dynastic privileges, titles or rank and any such are excluded from the Royal House of Romania and from the line of succession to the throne. Early life =Birth= Margareta was born on 26 March 1949 at Clinique de Montchoisi in Lausanne, Switzerland as the first of King Michael I and Queen Anne's five daughters. She was baptised in the Romanian Orthodox Church; her godfather is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Her godmother was her maternal grandmother Princess Margaret of Denmark who was also her namesake. She was followed by four sisters: Princess Elena (born 1950), Princess Irina (born 1953), Princess Sophie (born 1957) and Princess Maria (born 1964). =Childhood= Margareta spent her childhood at family homes in Lausanne and at Ayot House, St Lawrence, in Hertfordshire, England. During holidays she and her sisters spent time with their grandparents; paternally with Helen, Queen Mother, at Villa Sparta in Italy and maternally, with Princess Margaret and her husband Prince Ren√© of Bourbon-Parma in Copenhagen. She and her sisters were told \\"fascinating tales of a homeland they couldn't visit\\" by their father. She also spent time with relatives in Greece, Italy, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain. Margareta met Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom for the first time in the summer of 1952 at Balmoral Castle, when she was three years old. In her childhood, she spent holidays with Prince Charles and his sister, Princess Anne, who were close to Margareta, as well as Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, and the Greek, Danish and Luxembourg royal families. Queen Helen's interest in horses influenced Margareta to become an equestrian. In 1964, along with five other princesses, Margareta was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark to King Constantine II of Greece. Education =Early education= In 1956 Margareta lived with Queen Helen for six months at her villa in Florence, attending kindergarten until returning to Switzerland, where she attended a primary school, with Princess Sophie, from age six to nine. =Secondary education= In 1960 she was sent to a boarding school in Old Basing, Hampshire, where she stayed until she was 13; she found it difficult to be away from home but was glad that she became more mature, noting that her English improved later. Her favourite subjects were: art, riding and natural sciences (she learned how to grow plants) and also piano lessons. In 1964 she began secondary education at a French school in Switzerland, where she studied philosophy. \\"I did my baccalaureate in Switzerland, got my driving licence the next day and I left very fast. I really didn't enjoy the baccalaureate, I didn't enjoy school, I didn't enjoy Switzerland\\" Margareta said in an interview in 2007. After her Swiss-French baccalaureate, rather than heading straight for Paris and studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, her preferred destination, she was persuaded to return to Florence to spend a year with her Romanian grandmother, whom she described as \\"my spiritual guide, my mentor, guiding star. She taught me a lot about life, opened my eyes to all that is beautiful and good in the world\\". Her dreams of art school were soon replaced by a determination to go to university. =Further education= Queen Helen's aesthetic tastes extended Margareta's cultural horizons and excited her to meet interesting people who were part of her grandmother's circle of acquaintances, in which she met Romanian and Greek diplomats, artists, intellectuals, scientists and craftsmen, as well as subjects. Helen grandmother took the opportunity to encourage the Margareta to attend a university and pursue a career at the United Nations. As relatives and friends of her parents lived in London, Margareta was hesitant to attend a university there, not wanting to be tied down by formalities associated with being a princess, and chose instead to attend the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Known there as \\"Margareta de Roumanie\\", for the first few weeks she felt a depressing \\"sense of foreignness\\". She studied sociology, political science and public international law. Engaging herself in activities on the campus, she became a member of the students' representative council. In 1974 she completed her studies and obtained her degrees. During an interview from 2011 she confessed that her first desire was studying philosophy: \\"I really enjoyed philosophy, but I realized I had to be a bit more practical. Then, in the 1970s, sociology was fashionable, so I chose it alongside the international law I wanted for the United Nations, and the political sciences because they could relate to international relations and give the opportunity to know systems. This combination of studies was very interesting. Maybe now, if I had to resume, I would do something more practical.\\" While at the University during her twenties, Margareta was involved in a five-year romantic relationship with Gordon Brown, who would serve as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010; In 2007 she was interviewed by an editor of The Daily Telegraph: \\"It was a very solid and romantic story; I never stopped loving him, but one day it didn't seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing,\\" she said. Careers After her graduation in 1974, she worked in a number of British universities for a few years, specialising in medical sociology and Public health policy. Later she participated in an international research program coordinated by the World Health Organization that focused on developing health policy recommendations and preventive pilot projects. In 1979, she then worked for the agencies of the United Nations: The World Health Organization and The United Nations Population Fund, where she joined Social projects in public health, based in Africa and Latin America where she came into contact with suffering and deficiencies of the disadvantaged which was the kick start of her experience of the beginning of a road in humanitarian service, which she has still followed since then. In 1983, she moved to Rome and joined the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations where, as a member of the World Food Day project team, she worked for three years on the public awareness campaign concerning agricultural programs, nutrition, and poverty alleviation. She belonged to the International Fund for Agricultural Development team until 1986. In 1986, she joined the International Fund for Agricultural Development where she handled relations with nongovernmental organizations and assisted in raising funds for IFAD programs. Problems started to arise in Romania and in the summer of 1989 Margareta resigned from her job. Concluding that something fundamental was needed in Eastern Europe, she moved to Geneva to work with the Romanian Crown Council and the Royal family, whose members began preparing themselves for what was to come. Romania =Romanian revolution= In mid 1989, civil and governmental unrest started arising in the Eastern Bloc as the loosening of control of Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union had triggered most of the impact for the former states which started a Revolutionary wave leading to the Revolutions of 1989. In early December 1989, there was civil unrest by the anti-government protesters and on 16 December 12-day Romanian Revolution started; On the commands of President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu a mass genocide was led by members of the military who unanimously switched on the 22nd from supporting him to backing the protesting population. On 25 December, President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and his wife Deputy Prime Minister Elena Ceau»ôescu were deposed, captured and executed by orders from a Drumhead military tribunal; 42 years of the Socialist Republic of Romania had ended. The revolution was the first overthrow of the ruling governmental system since King Michael's Coup which he successfully staged in 1944 by arresting members of the Military Government which supported Nazi Germany. During the Revolution, all members of the Royal Family took a part to console the situation outside of Romania. =Arrival in Romania= While she was visiting one orphanage, a child in a filthy cot died in front of her. It spurred her to establish the Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation in 1990.Princess Margaret of Romania Trust website Operating in Romania, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, Belgium and the United States, the Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation develops programs that: *improve the living conditions of children and young people, families at risk and the elderly; *stimulate intergenerational solidarity and create bridges of communication between the young and the elderly; *contribute to the institutional development of NGOs working with children and seniors; *foster local creativity and talent. The foundation has raised more than five million euros, through which it contributes to the development of Romanian civil society. 2006 Annual Report , The Princess Margarita of Romania Foundation website Since taking up permanent residence in Romania, along with her parents, Margareta continues to engage in public activities there, sometimes along with officials of the Romanian Republic including, for example, in January 2015 the celebration of the 25th year since her return to Romania held at the Romanian Athenaeum, followed by a dinner at the CEC Palace with Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ponta and Senate President CƒÉlin Popescu-TƒÉriceanu; and of 200 guests ‚Äî foreign personalities, but also Romanian ones activating in all fields of interest, who have supported the Royal Family for the past 25 years. Out of these personalities of Romania, the United States of America, France, and Switzerland, a certain number was decorated by Margareta, on the occasion of the aforementioned series of events. Among the foreign personalities decorated was Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand, the nephew of the former president of France as well as hosting a March 2015 gala at the dynasty's historical family seat, Pele»ô Castle, in honour of the Romanian Rugby Union, attended by Klaus Johannis, the first incumbent Romanian president to pay an official visit to the former royal family. =Romanian Red Cross= On 15 May 2015, the General Assembly of the Romanian Red Cross elected Margareta as President of the Romanian Red Cross. The Red Cross was instituted as a Romanian branch of the International Red Cross in 1876, under the reign of her great-great grand uncle King Carol I of Romania, it benefited from important support from his wife Queen Elisabeth; From 1915, the Romanian Red Cross received the leadership of Margareta's Paternal great grandmother Queen Marie, who was seen as a symbol, an ambassador and an inspirational leader of the organisation; Margareta's paternal grandmother: Queen Helen, Queen Mother also provided great patronage to the organisation during the Second World War. This is a role in which Margareta will be further leading by following and fulfilling the legacy of her ancestors. In her statement, she expressed her gratitude to the Romanian Red Cross representatives, who re- established a long and valuable tradition of partnership between the oldest organization in the country and the Romanian Crown. In September 2015 she and her Red Cross entourage organised a 2-day festival for the 28th annual First Aid Convention in Europe held at HerƒÉstrƒÉu Park, where there was an annual competition that brought together teams of first aid from the Red Cross and Red Crescent in Europe to demonstrate their abilities of first aid through demonstrations of emergency intervention and a gala held later on in the day for the chance for the Red Cross members to meet with each other; 500 personalities from 28 first aid teams in 24 European countries took part in the FACE competition. From the 6‚Äì10 December 2015 Margareta travelled to Geneva, Switzerland with her Red Cross entourage and accompanied by LazƒÉr ComƒÉnescu, Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs for the 32nd International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent where she met with representatives of the Government of Switzerland, International Red Cross and Red Crescent and Members of the Diplomatic corps; During the conferences, Margareta spoke about the effectiveness of her leadership and the participation of the 'Romanian Red Cross in national and foreign affairs and also the analysis of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015‚Äì2030 of the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction which is complemented by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. On the final day of the conferences Margareta discussed with her Foreign Royal counterparts: Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg, President of the Luxembourg Red Cross; Duchess Sophie, Hereditary Princess of Liechtenstein, President of the Liechtenstein Red Cross and Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, President of the Netherlands Red Cross about the relationships of Royalty and the dedication one must have towards the National Red Cross. Custodian of the Crown of Romania =Succession= Although at her birth she was not expected to inherit the defunct Romanian throne and the headship of the Romanian Royal Family, the birth of four younger sisters and no brother meant that without a change in the royal family's succession laws, male members of the House of Hohenzollern would succeed her father as pretenders to the Romanian throne, in accordance with the Salic law enshrined in both the defunct royal Romanian Constitution of 1923 and the defunct Statute of the Romanian royal house, dated 1884. In 1997 King Michael designated Margareta as successor to \\"all prerogatives and rights\\" of his, indicating his desire for a gender-blind succession to the throne; although there was much consideration of altering the line of succession, no actions were taken until 30 December 2007, when King Michael I issued the statutes for the Royal House, called The Fundamental Rules of the Royal House of Romania, Following the announcement of The Fundamental Rules, King Michael asked the Romanian Government that, should it consider restoring the monarchy, it should also abolish the Salic law of succession. As Margareta has no children, her designated heir is her younger sister Princess Elena. According to the Romanian Constitution of 1923, which barred women from ascending to the throne, Margareta and her sisters are not eligible to succeed to the throne of Romania, which is also why King Michael issued The Fundamental Rules, which comply with EU legislation, in particular with the European Convention on Human Rights. According to article 1, paragraph 2 of the Fundamental Rules of the Royal Family of Romania, \\"The Head of the Royal House of Romania, according to all the practices and conventions of today, is de jure or de facto Sovereign in terms of authority over the Royal House of Romania at any moment. Immediately after the death of the Head of the Royal House of Romania, without any subsequent proclamation, the Evident Heir or the Presumptive Heir, depending on who will be alive and the first in the succession line at that time, will receive from that moment the title and the name of King or Queen, regardless of the position of the Family as a Reigning or Non-Reigning Dynasty, and whether or not he/she will later choose to use such a title or appellation.\\" Accordingly, since Romania is still a republic, Margareta, chose not to use the title of Queen and is instead Custodian of the Romanian Crown, a title that Michael I offered her. Paul-Philippe Hohenzollern (son of King Michael's illegitimate half-brother, Carol Lambrino) denounces King Michael's actions of creating The Fundamental Rules and severing ties with the House of Hohenzollern. Paul also claims to be head of the Romanian Royal Family, unlike his father. =Foreign relations= Although Margareta has no official role within the politics of Romania to maintain ties with other countries, she does however heed to and maintain the morals of the House of Romania in which she develops and keeps close ties with foreign countries, governments, heads and former heads of state and also the people of the country; During these visits she is often accompanied by her husband Prince Radu, who is a special Romanian Government representative for Integration, Co-operation and Sustainable Development. During visits which she undertakes, accompanied by Prince Radu, they often hold lectures of what Romania contributes to the European Union. Margareta has been to foreign countries for visits, such as: Belgium: meeting privately with King Albert II, his wife Queen Paola and their daughter Princess Astrid in May 2008; The Czech Republic: meeting with Livia Klausov√°, 3rd First Lady in February 2007 and a second time meeting with Petr Neƒças, 9th Prime Minister in November 2010; Denmark: meeting privately with Queen Margrethe II and her husband Prince Henrik in November 2010; France: meeting with Hans-Gert P√∂ttering, 23rd President of the European Parliament in June 2008; India: as a guest of the Governments of Maharashtra, Goa and Rajasthan meeting with the leaders and members of each cabinet in November 2004; Israel: as a guest of the Knesset meeting with members of the Cabinet of Israel and also Patriarch Theophilos III in April 2014; Jordan: meeting with King Abdullah II and members of the Royal Family in May 2014, 2017 and 2018; Moldova: meeting with President Nicolae Timofti, Prime Minister Iurie LeancƒÉ and members of the Cabinet of Moldova in October 2013; Qatar: meeting with Emir Hamad in November 2009; Spain: meeting privately with King Juan Carlos I and his wife Queen Sofia in June 2009; and King Felipe and Queen Letizia in 2018; Sweden: meeting privately with King Carl XVI and his wife Queen Silvia in June 2010; Turkey: meeting with Murat Yal√ßƒ±nta≈ü, President of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce in March 2008 and another time meeting privately with Bartholomew I of Constantinople in September 2012; the Vatican City for a private audience with Pope John Paul II in April 2003 and with Pope Benedict XVI in June 2012. She has also been a guest of former royal families, such as: the Hohenzollerns: with Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia in September 2008; and the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒás: with her 2nd cousin Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Crown Princess Katherine in 2007, 2010, November 2013, and 2015. Apart from being present for official visits hosted by her father, Margareta hosts official visits at Elisabeta Palace, where there is: a private meeting, a meeting with members of the Romanian and foreign government, a visit to the local areas, a visit to her charity 'FPMR' and finally planting a tree in the garden of the palace to mark the visit of the guests. She has hosted official visits from: Belgium: with her 2nd cousin Prince Lorenz, Archduke of Austria-Este in September 2015; the Czech Republic: with President Milo≈° Zeman in May 2014; Jordan: with Princess Muna al-Hussein in June 2013, May 2015, 2016, and 2017 and also with Princess Rym al-Ali in April 2011; Liechtenstein: with Hereditary Prince Alois and his wife Princess Sophie in June 2010; Lithuania: with Vytautas Landsbergis, former President of Lithuania and his wife Gra≈æina Ruƒçytƒó-Landsbergienƒó in June 2015; Luxembourg: with her 2nd cousin Prince Guillaume in September 2014; Senegal: with Viviane Wade, 3rd First Lady of Senegal in November 2008; Spain: with her 2nd cousin Felipe, Prince of Asturias and his wife Princess Letizia in April 2009; Switzerland: with members of the Swiss Federal Council in October 2002; United Kingdom: with her 4th cousin Charles, Prince of Wales, in June 2012, 2016, 2017, and 2018 and with Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in June 2013. She has also hosted visits for former royal families, such as: her 2nd cousin, former King Simeon II and his wife Queen Margarita of Bulgaria in November 2012 and 2016; her mother's cousin Crown Prince Otto of Austria in October 2005; Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia in April 2008, 2011;, 2016 and 2017; her 2nd cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark in April 2012 and 2017; Prince Leka of Albania in June 2014 and 2017; her 2nd cousin Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Crown Princess Katherine of Yugoslavia in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2017; and Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Baden and his wife Princess Stephanie in April 2013. Margareta also maintains close ties with her foreign reigning royal relatives, she has attended many events such as: the weddings of Prince Albert II of Monaco and Charlene Wittstock, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling, Prince Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Countess St√©phanie de Lannoy, Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton, and many other royal weddings; anniversaries; The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II of United Kingdom, birthdays, and funerals. Marriage In 1994, she met Radu Duda, a Romanian citizen and actor, through the work of the Princess Margareta Foundation. Duda was working as an art therapist in orphanages when he was introduced to the princess during her tour of the foundation's programs. On 24 July 1996, Margareta married Duda in a civil wedding at Versoix.Civil marriage The religious service took place in Lausanne on 21 September 1996 and was officiated by Bishop Damaskinos of Switzerland, who also attended the wedding of Queen Anne and King Michael in 1948 when he was a young deacon. The Bishop attended all the special events of the Royal Family, such as the baptism of Margareta and her sisters, Elena and Irina, who also took part in the Greek Orthodox Church in Lausanne. This is also the first place where the Queen Mother Helen (Elena) of Romania was buried. During the religious service, Margareta was accompanied by King Michael, who was also a godfather in the first part of the wedding ceremony, along with King Constantine II of Greece, who was spiritual parent at the ceremony of gold crowns, according to the royal ritual. Over 250 guests, members of the royal families around the world, including Queen Sof√≠a of Spain, Infanta Elena of Spain, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Crown Prince Alexander and Princess Katherine of Serbia, Queen Farah of Iran, King Constantine II of Greece and Queen Anne-Marie, Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, Prince Hassan and Princess Sarvath of Jordan alongside hundreds of Romanians attended the religious ceremony and the following party at Polo Club. The royal couple spent the honeymoon in Jordan in Amman and in Aqaba on the shores of the Red Sea and the Dead Sea for 18 days at the invitation of the Jordanian Royal Family. He was accorded the style \\"Radu, Prince of Hohenzollern-Veringen\\" on 1 January 1999, \\"The Prime Minister proposed Radu Duda a seat as a Senator of the Democrat Social Party (ruling party in Romania),\\" MEDIAFAX AGENCY, 6 August 2004 and was subsequently styled \\"HRH Radu, Prince of Romania\\", being referred to by King Michael on 30 December 2007, as future \\"Prince Consort of Romania\\". In Margareta's company and, more often alone, he has represented the former royal family publicly on various occasions. \\"10 May ‚Äì Sad Destiny, Memorable Date\\", Dilema Veche, 12 May 2006 They live in the Elisabeta Palace in Bucharest. Controversies BAE Systems, one of the donors to the Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation, and its representatives have been involved in a corruption scandal involving purchase by the Romanian government of two decommissioned UK Royal Navy frigates refurbished by BAE, for which an alleged ¬£7 million bribe was paid,\\"Bribery inquiry may force ¬£7m refund to Romania\\", The Guardian, 15 June 2006 some of which, it has also been alleged, ZeamƒÉ de dude , \\"Mulberry Juice\\", G√¢ndul, 21 June 2006 ended up in the pockets of the Hohenzollern royal family to which Margareta belongs.

In an official communiqu√© sent to the newspaper, Prince Radu denied any such lobbying activities, stating that as patron of the British-Romanian Chamber of Commerce of which BAE Systems is a member, he met with its representatives as well as those of other British companies. Political support The main pro-monarchist party PN≈¢CD, currently extra- parliamentary, is ambiguous in its support for Margareta. In 2002, it rejected any role for her or her husband in a restored monarchy, PN≈¢CD g√¢nde≈üte revenirea la monarhie prin Prin≈£ul Nicolae, \\"PN≈¢CD Plans The Restoration of Monarchy through Prince Nicholas\\", Ziua, 1 March 2002 PN≈¢CD cautƒÉ un Rege , \\"PN≈¢CD Is Looking for A King\\", Evenimentul Zilei, 1 March 2002 while in 2003 the Cluj branch of PN≈¢CD officially invited her to be its electoral candidate to the Senate of the Republic in upcoming elections.

In December 2017, on the backdrop of the increased capital of trust in the Royal House of Romania, re-emerging with the death of King Michael, the executive chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Party Nicolae BƒÉdƒÉlau said that one could organize a referendum on the transition to the monarchical ruling form, arguing that \\"it is not a bad thing, considering that the countries that have the monarchs are developed countries\\", being a project of the future. At the same time, the leader of the coalition party and the president of the Senate of Romania, CƒÉlin Popescu TƒÉriceanu, reinforced this idea, claiming that he is a convinced monarchist and \\"Constitutional monarchy has the advantage of placing the monarch over political games, case: the president, instead of being an arbitrator, prefers to be a player. \\" Honours and awards =Honours= Dynastic * House of Romania: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Order of Carol I * House of Romania: Sovereign Royal Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Crown * House of Romania: Sovereign Knight of the Royal Decoration of the Custodian of the Romanian Crown, Special Class * Portuguese Royal Family: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Isabel Foreign * : Recipient of the Medal of Merit of the Ministry of Defence, 2nd Class * : Knight of the Order of the Legion of Honour * : Knight Grand Cross of the Sovereign Military Order of MaltaFamilia Regala * : Recipient of the Dimitrie Cantemir Medal * : Recipient of the Medal of DemocracyMoldpresFamilia Regala * : Recipient of the 50th Birthday Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden * : Recipient of the 70th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf =Awards= National awards * : Honorary Citizen of the Cluj County * : Honorary Citizen of Ia»ôi * : Honorary degree of the University of Pite»ôti * : Honorary degree of the Banat University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine * Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee: Recipient of the Gold Olympic Order Foreign awards * : Recipient of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise‚Äôs medalFamilia Regala * : Honorary Citizen of The Jerash Governorate * : Recipient of the Jordan Red Crescent‚Äôs Golden Medal * : Honorary Citizen of Scotland * : Alumna of the University of Edinburgh * : Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Northern Europe: The North Cross ;Honorific eponym * : Principesa Mostenitoare Margareta Scoala Gimnaziala ;Honorary academic degrees * : Honorary Degree of the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International RelationsDoctor Honoris Causa pentru Familia RegalƒÉ Ancestry Publications * The Romanian Crown at 140 years.

The Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten are a group of royal monuments in Upper Egypt. They are carved into the cliffs surrounding the area of Akhetaten, or the Horizon of Aten, which demarcates the limits of the site. The Pharaoh Akhenaten commissioned the construction of Akhetaten in year five of his reign during the New Kingdom. It served as a sacred space for the god Aten in an uninhabited location roughly halfway between Memphis and Thebes at today's Tell El-Amarna. The boundary stelae include the foundation decree of Akhetaten along with later additions to the text, which delineate the boundaries and describe the purpose of the site and its founding by the Pharaoh. Total of sixteen stelae have been discovered around the area. According to Barry Kemp, the Pharaoh Akhenaten did not ‚Äúconceive of Akhetaten as a city, but as a tract of sacred land‚Äù. Discovery and publication Sixteen boundary stelae have so far been discovered at Tell El-Amarna. The French Jesuit Claude Sicard was the first European to call attention to the stelae. He published a sketch of Stela A and a description of the site after visiting it in 1714. Stela U was discovered by A. C. Harris and George Gliddon in 1840 and, also in the early 1840s, another stela was discovered by George Lloyd of Brynestyn. Lloyd made a copy of Stela P, which was published along with a new copy of Stela A and a copy of Stela U made by √âmile Prisse d'Avennes. Prisse was the first one to realize, based on the inscriptions on the stelae, that there must be at least six stelae that demarcate the area of the site. In 1843 and 1845, Karl Richard Lepsius travelled to the site with a Prussian expedition and discovered four new stelae, later named stelae K, M, N, and R. The practice of referring to the stelae with a discontinuous series of letters, in order to leave space for possible further discoveries, was begun by W. M. Flinders Petrie whose survey of Amarna was published in 1894. In 1892, Petrie found six new stelae at the site: stelae B and F on the western side of the Nile River, and stelae J, L, P, and V on the eastern side. From the previously found stelae, only Stela A is located in the western side. In 1893, Percy E. Newberry found Stela Q on the east bank. Jean Daressy published the earliest printed translation of the legible parts of the text, also in 1893, based on copies of stelae S and R, using variants found on stelae A and U. In 1898, stelae J, K, M, N, Q, R, S, and U were copied by Georg Steindorff who also photographed the sites of the stelae and took some loose fragments with him to Germany. Steindorff subsequently made his materials available for the Egypt Exploration Fund. In 1901, Norman de Garis Davies was shown the northernmost stela on the east bank, which led him to include the boundary stelae in his publication of the Rock Tombs of El Amarna in 1908. Davies's publication included a translation of the two different sets of stelae, which Davies named the ‚ÄúEarlier Proclamation‚Äù and the ‚ÄúLater Proclamation‚Äù, as well as of the texts that were added to the stelae bearing the Later Proclamation in the year eight of Akhenaten's reign. The latest addition to stelae A and B was termed the ‚ÄúColophon‚Äù by Davies. A partial translation of the stelae had also appeared in James Henry Breasted‚Äôs Ancient Records published in 1906. An additional stela was discovered by the archeological survey of the Egypt Exploration Society in the season 2005-2006 and it was labeled Stela H. Earlier Proclamation Stelae K, M, and X on the east side of the Nile contain what Davies termed the Earlier Proclamation. All three stelae contain both vertical and horizontal lines of text. Stela K is the best preserved and was made to replace Stela M which was damaged early on, thus necessitating a replacement. Both Stela K and Stela M are located in the southern side of the site and the text in their horizontal lines reads from left to right, away from the center of the site. Stela X is located in the northern side of the site and it is a mirror image of stelae K and M in that its horizontal lines read from right to left, also away from the center. The inscription on the stelae K, M, and X is dated to the fifth regnal year of Akhenaten in day 13 of the season of Peret. They include the full title of the god Aten, as well as titles of the king Akhenaten and the king's wife Nefertiti. The stelae also describe the founding of the site by the pharaoh, reasons for choosing it, the proposed layout of the site, instructions regarding the burials of the royal family and certain notables, and instructions for the maintenance of the cult of Aten. The Earlier Proclamation also includes a promise from Akhenaten to build various temples and other structures to the god Aten in the location. The latter part of the text is fragmentary and has inspired a variety of interpretations. Later Proclamation What Davies termed the Later Proclamation was carved on stelae J, N, P, Q, R, S, U, and V on the eastern side of the Nile, and on stelae A, B, and F on the western side. The inscription of the Later Proclamation is dated to year six of Akhenaten's reign in the day 13 of the season of Peret, which corresponds with the one year anniversary of the Earlier Proclamation, and includes a ‚Äúrenewal of the oath‚Äù that appeared in the Earlier Proclamation regarding the location and permanence of the site. with some modifications to include more land, especially a swath of agricultural land in the cultivation on the western side of the river. Titulary of the god Aten is also given, along with a repetition of much of the Earlier Proclamation. The Later Proclamation includes a description of events that took place after the inscription of the Earlier Proclamation, such as a journey of the pharaoh to the southeastern crag of the site. The Later Proclamation also mentions six principal boundary stelae that delimit the site. Repetition of the Oath and the Colophon Early in the year eight of Akhenaten's reign, in the season of Peret, a repetition of the oath of Akhenaten regarding the site is added to the stelae furnished with the Later Proclamation, and later that same year, in the season of Akhet, another text, termed the ‚ÄúColophon‚Äù by Davies, is added to stelae A and B. The Colophon contains a reaffirmation of the borders and Aten's ownership of the site. Stela L Stela L was found in 1892 by Petrie and is located about seven meters south from Stela M. The stela is different from the rest of the stelae in its small size and is badly weathered. Davies did not include Stela L among the boundary stelae due to its dissimilarity with the other stelae. Purpose of the Stelae The boundary stelae of Akhenaten were carved in locations around the city of Akhetaten that was built by the pharaoh Akhenaten to his god Aten. Their purpose is to demarcate the boundaries of the holy site of Aten, but also to inform people about the intentions of the pharaoh and the nature of the site as a holy place for Aten. The boundary stelae are a major source of information about the religious reforms of Akhenaten, as they include the full titulary of the god Aten and other clues about the cult practiced in Akhetaten. The stelae are royal monuments commissioned by the pharaoh and thus contain an inherent bias that favors the king's undertakings and condemns those who opposed his reforms. They are nonetheless important historical artefacts and are very useful to historians. Scholarly arguments Stelae X, M, and K have an image carved on top of the text, showing Akhenaten and Nefertiti worshipping Aten with their daughter Meritaten. Their second daughter Meketaten was later added to the picture in stela K, which is taken to signal that her birth must have taken place sometime after year five of Akhenaten's reign, to which year the Earlier Proclamation is dated. Another unnamed figure was also later added to Stela K, while Stela X, and probably also the damaged Stela M, included only Meketaten and her parents. The text of the Earlier Proclamation only mentions Meketaten and not her younger sisters. The stelae that have the Later Proclamation inscribed on them are more elaborate than the earlier ones and include rock- cut statues of the king and his wife, as well as two of their daughters, suggesting that the second daughter was born by the time these stelae were carved in the year six of Akhenaten. In addition to the second daughter that was added to Stela K, a third daughter is added to stelae A, B, P, Q, and U, which all have the Later Proclamation inscribed on them and are thus dated to year six or later of Akhenaten's reign. This has led Murnane and Van Siclen to conclude that only Meritaten had already been born by year five, while her younger sister Meketaten was most likely born during year five or six and the third princess Ankhesenpaaten toward the end of year six at the earliest, but most likely sometime in year seven or eight before the completion of the later stelae. Due to the fragmented part of the Earlier Proclamation making a mention of some unsavory things the pharaoh had heard at Thebes, a theory that posits a clash with the priesthood of Amun of Thebes has been put forward by scholars. Barry Kemp argues that the full expression of the beliefs of Akhenaten ‚Äúdemanded the creation of a physical sacred landscape‚Äù and that the boundary stelae are ‚Äúthe most extensive personal testimony we have as to what was in his mind‚Äù. Stelae no longer In Situ At least nine of the stelae have been damaged by thieves and one, Stela F, has disappeared altogether. Two others, stelae P and Q, have also been virtually destroyed. The Titulary of Aten The full title of the god Aten in the Earlier Proclamation is: ‚Äúthe Good God, who rejoices [in Ma‚Äôat], Lord of Heaven, Lord of [earth]; the [great living] o[rb who illumi]nates the two banks; (my [?]) Father, The Aten; the great living orb who is in jubilee within the [house] of the Orb in ‚ÄòHorizon of the Orb‚Äô‚Äù. The title as given in the Later Proclamation is slightly different and reads: ‚Äúthe Good God who is content with Ma‚Äôat, the lord of heaven, the lord of earth, the great living orb who illuminates the Two Banks. Live the (divine, royal) Father, The Aten, given life everlastingly forever, the great living orb who is in jubilee within the estate of the orb in ‚ÄòHorizon of the Orb‚Äô‚Äù.

It begins at the base of Niagara Falls and ends down river at the edge of the geological formation known as the Niagara Escarpment near Queenston, Ontario, where the Falls originated about 12,500 years ago. The position of the falls has receded upstream toward Lake Erie due to the falling waters' slow erosion of the riverbed's hard Lockport dolomite (a form of limestone that is the surface rock of the escarpment), combined with rapid erosion of the relatively soft layers beneath it. This erosion has created the gorge. The force of the river current in the gorge is one of the most powerful in the world; because of the dangers this presents, kayaking the gorge has generally been prohibited. On multiple occasions, the rapids of the gorge have claimed the lives of people attempting to run them. However, on isolated occasions, world-class experts have been permitted to navigate the stretch. Tourists can bounce and splash through the rapids of the Niagara Gorge on commercial tours in rugged jetboats, which are based at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, at Lewiston, New York, at Youngstown, New York, and in midsummer at Niagara Glen Nature Centre on the Niagara Parkway in Ontario.

He is most widely remembered as a possible inventor of the thaumatrope, which he published with W. Phillips in April 1825. Life Paris was a medical researcher of distinction, for example making one of the earliest observations of occupational causes of cancer when, in 1822, he recognised that their exposure to arsenic fumes might be contributing to the unusually high rate of scrotal skin cancer among men working in copper- smelting in Cornwall and Wales (his conclusions on this subject are included in a book that is also a visitor's guide to West Cornwall).

Located in Los Angeles, California, ONE Archives has been a part of the University of Southern California Libraries since 2010. ONE Archives' collections contain over two million items including periodicals; books; film, video and audio recordings; photographs; artworks; ephemera, such as clothing, costumes, and buttons; organizational records; and personal papers. ONE Archives also operates a small gallery and museum space devoted to LGBT art and history in West Hollywood, California. Use of the collections is free during regular business hours. ONE Archives originated from ONE, Inc., which began publishing the earliest national homosexual publication in 1952. In 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality, utilizing the term \\"Homophile Studies.\\" In 1994, ONE, Inc. and the International Gay and Lesbian Archives run by Jim Kepner merged. Since 1994 the organization has operated solely as a LGBT archive. Mission ONE Archives' mission statement reads as follows: \\"It is the mission of ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries to collect, preserve, and make accessible LGBTQ historical materials while promoting new scholarship on and public awareness of queer histories.\\" History ONE, Inc. was founded in 1952 to publish the nation's first wide- circulated, national homosexual periodical, ONE Magazine. In 1953, ONE Inc. became the first gay organization to open a public office in Downtown Los Angeles. The original founders include Martin Block, Tony Sanchez (aka Tony Reyes), and Dale Jennings. The corporation's original core members included Martin Block, Tony Reyes, Dale Jennings, Guy Rousseau, Merton Bird, Don Slater, William Lambert (aka W. Dorr Legg), Eve Elloree (aka Joan Corbin), and Ann Carll Reid (aka Irma \\"Corky\\" Wolf). In 1955, ONE Inc. held the ONE Midwinter Institute, the first in a series of conferences to bring together experts and community members to talk about gay and lesbian topics. In 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality under the name of \\"Homophile Studies\\". In 1957, marking the first time the Supreme Court of the United States explicitly ruled on homosexuality, ONE Inc. fought to distribute its magazine by mail, and prevailed. The ruling in the case, One, Inc. v. Olesen, not only allowed ONE to distribute its magazine, but also paved the way for other controversial publications to be sent through the U.S. mail. Also during the 1950s ONE Inc. became an ad hoc community center and began a library. Jim Kepner was involved in adding material to this library. As the burgeoning Gay Liberation movement took off and became more closely intertwined with the movements for civil rights of the 1960s and 1970s, ONE Inc., Jim Kepner and a growing group of activists were poised to collect original materials from that critical time period. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, ONE obtained crucial documents chronicling the establishment of the \\"gay community\\" and its established and increasingly diverse groups and organizations. Since the 1980s, the archival collections have grown substantially as gay issues and gay culture became more integrated into the mainstream culture of the United States. In October 2012 ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding and the printing of ONE Magazine. Organizational timeline The institutional history of ONE reveals a set of complex, overlapping and groundbreaking activities that provided a wide variety of pioneering services to LGBT Americans: * October 1952: The idea of a magazine for homosexuals is first discussed in a Mattachine Society meeting. * November 1952: ONE, Inc. is founded. * January 1953: The first issue of ONE Magazine is published. * August/September 1953: The Los Angeles postal authorities seize the August edition of ONE Magazine. The issue, which bore the title \\"Homosexual Marriage?\\" on the cover, is released three weeks later without explanation. * November 1953: ONE Inc. opens an office in downtown Los Angeles at 232 South Hill Street. * October 1954: The Los Angeles postal authorities seize the October issues of ONE Magazine on charges of obscenity. * 1956: The ONE Institute for Homophile Studies opens. * January 13, 1958: After four years of litigation, the Supreme Court declares ONE Magazine is not in violation of obscenity laws. * 1962: ONE Inc. moves to 2256 Venice Boulevard. * 1967: ONE Magazine ceases publication. * 1975: Jim Kepner's personal archive is named the Western Gay Archives. * 1979: The Western Gay Archives is renamed the National Gay Archives: Natalie Barney/Edward Carpenter Library and moves to 1654 North Hudson Avenue in Hollywood. * August 1981: ONE Institute becomes the first institution of higher learning in the United States to offer masters and doctoral degrees in Homophile Studies. * 1983: ONE Inc. moves into the Milbank Estate at 3340 Country Club Drive purchased by philanthropist Reed Erickson. Soon after, for reasons uncertain, Erickson seeks to have ONE removed from the estate. * 1984: The National Gay Archives is renamed the International Gay & Lesbian Archives (IGLA). * 1988: IGLA moves to a space owned by the City of West Hollywood at 626 North Robertson Boulevard (the current location of the ONE Archives Gallery & Museum). * 1994: W.

ONE Archives Gallery & Museum, West Hollywood Since 2008, ONE Archives has operated an exhibition space in West Hollywood, California dedicated to presenting temporary exhibitions on LGBT art and history. The gallery is located in a city owned building that also houses the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives. In 2011, ONE Archives participated in the region-wide Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945-1980 initiative with the exhibition Cruising the Archive: Queer Art & Culture in Los Angeles, 1945-1980 which was presented at the ONE Gallery in West Hollywood, as well as at ONE Archives' main location on West Adams Boulevard and in the Treasure Room at the Doheny Library at the University of Southern California Libraries. The exhibition included works by Steven F. Arnold, Don Bachardy, Claire Falkenstein, Anthony Friedkin, Rudi Gernreich, Sister Corita Kent, and Kate Millett, among many other less known or anonymous artists. The only exhibition dedicated to queer content within the PST initiative, this exhibition marked the most comprehensive exhibition of materials from the collections at ONE Archives to date and was accompanied by a scholarly catalogue. The publication included contributions by Ann Cvetkovich, Vaginal Davis, Jennifer Doyle, Jack Halberstam, Catherine Lord, Richard Meyer, Ulrike M√ºller, and Dean Spade. The ONE Gallery has presented solo exhibitions of artwork by Steven F.

Much later, after Bruckner was granted an honorary University of Vienna doctorate in 1891, he dedicated the 1890 version of the work to that institution. Structure The symphony has four movements: The choices of key for the first two movements mirror Beethoven‚Äôs for his Fifth Symphony, but Bruckner has the timpani retune to A and E.  Versions  =Early drafts= Before completing the symphony in April 1866, Bruckner composed other forms of the Adagio and the Scherzo. The Adagio was first conceived in classical sonata form, with development, not the ternary structure with elaborate middle section. It was partially orchestrated, without trumpets or trombones; the recapitulation of the second subject, which was sketched only by the second violins and the woodwinds, breaks off at bar 154. Thereafter, five bars were left unwritten before the ‚Äî on the contrary ‚Äî fully orchestrated close of the movement. The originally conceived Scherzo was not fully orchestrated either, lacking trumpets and trombones, but its Trio was carried over unchanged in 1866. The scherzo of this draft version exhibits many irregular phrase rhythms which Bruckner evened out in later versions.J. Kraus, p. 279 In the leaflet for his recording of the symphony, Tintner says that \\"the earlier very short Scherzo, which Bruckner discarded before 1866 (because of its brevity?), with chromatic syncopation, is perhaps more interesting [than the final one].\\" In 1995 Wolfgang Grandjean edited the earlier Adagio and Scherzo as a study score (I/1a-STP). For performance purposes, Grandjean filled in the missing bars of the Adagio using the corresponding musical material in the 1866 score (Doblinger 74 014). A recording of these movements by Osmo V√§nsk√§ is in the Bruckner Archive, and an electronic recreation of it by Joan Schukking can be heard and downloaded at John Berky‚Äôs website. = True Linz version, 1866-1868 = The first version of the symphony was written in 1866 by Bruckner in Linz. It was published in 1998 by William Carragan and first recorded that same year by Georg Tintner in Glasgow. Bruckner made some slight adjustments to the score for the 1868 premiere. The premiere version has been issued by Thomas R√∂der in the new edition of the Bruckner Gesamtausgabe and has been premiered by the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra under Cornelius Meister during the 2014 Salzburger Festspiele. The first American performance using R√∂der‚Äôs edition, played by the Sam Houston State University Orchestra in 2016 with Jacob Sustaita conducting, can be heard and downloaded at John Berky‚Äôs website. =Revised Linz version, 1877/1884= Although routinely referred to as the ‚ÄúLinz‚Äù version and as having been made in 1866, this, the most frequently performed version of the work, was prepared neither in Linz nor in that year. It was made in 1877 in Vienna and revised there in 1884. It is available in editions by Robert Haas (published 1935) and Leopold Nowak (1953). =Vienna version, 1891= The Vienna version, which differs considerably from the earlier 1866 and 1877 versions, is available in an edition by G√ºnter Brosche, published in 1980 as part of the Gesamtausgabe. Editions =Doblinger, 1893= This was the first published edition. Edited by Doblinger under the supervision of Cyrill Hynais, it had few differences from the 1891 version. It has been recorded by F. Charles Adler, Volkmar Andreae and Fritz Zaun (scherzo only). =Haas, 1935= Of the (revised, 1877) \\"Linz version\\" and (1891) \\"Vienna version\\" in the earlier Gesamtausgabe. =Nowak, 1953= Of the (1877) \\"Linz version\\", again under Gesamtausgabe auspices. =Brosche, 1980= Of the (1891) \\"Vienna version\\", again as part of the Gesamtausgabe. =R√∂der, 2016= Of the 1868 version, as part of the new Bruckner Gesamtausgabe  Instrumentation  The score calls for a pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings, with an extra flute in the Adagio. Discography The first recording of any part of the work was made in 1934 by Fritz Zaun and the Berlin State Opera Orchestra; it included only the Scherzo, in the 1893 first published edition. The first complete commercial recording of the symphony came in 1950, with Volkmar Andreae conducting the Lower Austrian Tonk√ºnstler Orchestra, again using the first published edition. =Early drafts= There is a single commercially available recording of the early Adagio and Scherzo: * Ricardo Luna, Bruckner unknown, CD Preiser Records PR 91250, 2013 (transcription for chamber orchestra) = True Linz version, 1866-1868 = * Georg Tintner conducting the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, studio recording, Naxos, 1998 (Carragan ed.) * Gerd Schaller conducting the Philharmonie Festiva, live recording, Profil PH 12022, 2011 (Carragan ed.) * Christian Thielemann conducting the Staatskapelle Dresden ‚Äì Unitel BD LC15762, 2018 (R√∂der ed.) =Revised Linz version, 1877/1884= ;Haas edition *Georg- Ludwig Jochum conducting the RIAS Symphony Orchestra, live performance, Tahra, 1956 *Wolfgang Sawallisch conducting the Bayerisches Staatsorchester M√ºnchen, Orfeo, 1984 *Takashi Asahina conducting the Osaka Philharmonic, Canyon, 1994 ;Nowak edition *Eugen Jochum conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker, Deutsche Grammophon, 1966 *Eugen Jochum conducting the Dresden Staatskapelle, EMI, 1978 *Daniel Barenboim conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, DG, 1980 ‚Äì with the Te Deum. *Eliahu Inbal conducting the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra, Teldec, 1987 *Stanis≈Çaw Skrowaczewski conducting the Saarbr√ºcken Radio Symphony Orchestra, Oehms, 1995 *Simone Young conducting the Hamburg Philharmonic, live recording, Oehms OC 633, 2010 =Vienna version, 1891= ;Doblinger edition * Volkmar Andreae conducting the Austria State Symphony Orchestra, Forgotten Records, 1950 * F.

Overview Like all other paleodictyopteroids, the megasecopterans had sucking mouthparts. The suctorial mouth parts were probably used to pierce plant casings and extract high- quality plant materials, such as spores and pollen. Unlike some earlier insects, megasecopterans bore two pairs of wings, which were nearly of the same size. The wings probably were held horizontally, as in dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera). The wing bases tend to be very slender and petiolated, as in damselflies (Odonata, Zygoptera). The body was usually long and thin, although the genus Protohymen was rather stouter and shorter than a typical megasecopteran. Another distinctive feature was the presence of a number of fine processes projecting from the body, which in some cases could be longer than the body itself, forming long fringes on the insect's underside. During their relatively brief period of existence, the Megasecoptera were rather successful. It has been estimated that this insect order accounted for 50% of the insect biomass in some locations, but the available evidence might be misleading..

During the Spanish colonial period, Lal-lo was known as Ciudad de Nueva Segovia and was the seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia before it was moved to Vigan in Ilocos Sur. It is currently under efforts to regain its Spanish-era city status. Recently, the provincial government of Cagayan through the leadership of Governor Manuel Mamba is planning to make Lal-lo the provincial capital of Cagayan again. An international airport is currently being built in the southern part of Lal-lo. The Northern Cagayan International Airport is constructed to support the Cagayan Special Economic Zone in northern Cagayan and will also serve the seaborne traffic through Port Irene. The airport project involves the construction of a 2,200-meter runway, with a width of 45 meters, following the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Once completed, the international airport can accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A319-100 and Boeing regional jets of comparable size. Royal Air Philippines do twice weekly service using BAe146 aircraft.

History =Classical Era= In the classical era, Lal-lo was used to be the home of hunter-gatherers who were specialized in hunting mollusks. These hunter- gatherers have stockpiled their leftover mollusk shells in numerous sites in Lal-lo and neighboring Gattaran, until eventually, the shells formed into the largest stock of shell-midden sites in the entire Philippines. =Spanish Era= The first European to set foot on what is now the town of Lal-lo is Juan de Salcedo, the Spanish conquistador and grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, in 1572. Don Juan Pablo Carrion established it as a pueblo (municipality) in 1581 and named it Nueva Segovia. The reason is currently unknown, as the hometown of this Spanish soldier was Carri√≥n de los Condes (Palencia, Spain), as his last name, Carri√≥n, suggests. This is mentioned by Juan Miguel Aguilera and √Ångel Miranda in their book \\"Espadas del Fin del Mundo\\" (2016). =Diocese of Nueva Segovia= The evangelization cross of Lal- lo from Spanish colonial period, in front of the Nueva Segovia Church. The Cagayan River can be seen in the background. In 1595, Pope Clement VIII created the Diocese of Nueva Segovia and in 1596, the Dominicans accepted it as an ecclesiastical mission. Nueva Segovia had three churches: the cathedral that was under the secular clergy, and the parishes of Centro and Tocolona under the supervision of the Dominicans. But because of its distance from Manila and the constant threat of the Cagayan River's rampaging waters, the Diocese of Nueva Segovia was transferred to Vigan in Ilocos Sur province in 1758. The diocese's name went along with the transfer to Vigan and to avoid confusion, Bishop Miguel Garcia requested that Nueva Segovia and its suburbs renamed back to Lal-lo. The seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia remains in Vigan till today where is now elevated as the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia. The transfer affected the closure of the cathedral and the merging of the three churches into the single parish of Centro. The two other churches were abandoned and eventually destroyed because of neglect while the church of Centro, dedicated to Santo Domingo de Guzman (Saint Dominic) became what is now the church of Lal-lo. The remains of three bishops are interred in the church: Bishop Miguel de Benavides who was Nueva Segovia's first bishop and later of Manila where he founded the University of Santo Tomas, Bishop Diego de Soria who was the second bishop of the diocese, and Bishop Diego Aduarte who was the sixth. =Provincial capital= Lal-lo used to be the capital of Cagayan province until 1839 when the provincial seat of power was relocated to Tuguegarao. The decline of Lal-lo is the transformation of Tuguegarao as the most important town in Cagayan. It was accepted as an ecclesiastical mission by the Dominicans in 1604, 23 years after the foundation of Lal-lo. =Restoration of Cityhood= The first attempt of the restoration of Lal-lo's city status was made during the first term of Mayor Florante Pascual. The historical document originally signed by King Philip was not found, even after sending a research delegation to Madrid. Pascual determined that the restoration of Lal-lo's cityhood be made through an earlier bill. There was a move in the Philippine Congress to regain its cityhood as a component city, and also rename the municipality back to its original name, Nueva Segovia. Renewed attempt of city status restoration was carried out in January 2012. Board member Maria Olivia Pascual said that researchers had found a Spanish document that declared the municipality as a city. According to her, a bill seeking the restoration of the city status of Lal-lo (the former Ciudad Nueva Segovia) might be filed again through the efforts of First District Representative Juan Ponce Enrile, Jr.. As recently as 2018, vice mayor Oliver Pascual has said that the establishment of Northern Cagayan International Airport in the municipality would be \\"a great boost\\" in its bid for the restoration of its city status. =Modern Era of Harvey Deseo= In 2006, the shell-midden sites of Lal-lo and Gattaran were included in the UNESCO Tentative List for World Heritage Site inclusion, a step closer to becoming a world heritage site. The shell-midden sites are currently being conserved by the local government from looting to preserve its outstanding universal value.

Abulacan was founded by the ecclesiastical authorities on April 30, 1757 with San Juan Nepomuceno as the patron saint. Sometime in 1842, Vicar Pedro Montenegro, O.P. convinced the people to unite the two towns. The vicar named it \\"Pamplona\\" in memory of his hometown Pamplona in Spain. After the fusion, an agreement was made that there would be two patron saints of Pamplona: San Juan Nepomuceno and San Pedro de Martir. This is the reason why the town fiesta is celebrated for two days and the images of the two patron saints are carried during religious processions. The town fiesta is celebrated every April 29. In 1919, some of the prominent people of Pamplona recommended the transfer of the same to Bidduang, a barrio of Pamplona. The transfer was made on November 16, 1919, during the administration of municipal president Esteban Meneses by order of General Wood. In 1928, on the sixth year of the administration of municipal president Paulino Ifurung, one of his last acts was the transfer of the municipal government back to its old site, Pamplona, by then called \\"Albano.\\" Most interesting spot is the mouth of the Pamplona River. It saw history in the making for it was the starting point of Salcedo and his conquistadores when they explored Cagayan in 1572. Because of the river's strong current and unpredictable floods, Mayor Nicolas B. Aquino built in 1955 a concrete levee along Barangay Masi. He also built an irrigation system. It was the first of its kind in Cagayan. The town is also noted for its Malagabavi Cave and waterfall. It is located at the foot of a mountain virtually shaped like a pig. Legend has it that this cave was used by a giant as an entrance to his abode. It is said that he was a normal being like a human until his transformation to a giant by a goddess who fell in love with him. Barangays Pamplona is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.

It is located in the south-west part of Cagayan province in what is known as the Itawes Region, along which the Rio Chico runs west, south, and north-west of the town until it debouches into the Rio Ibanag somewhere near Nassiping. Piat is dubbed as the \\"Pilgrimage Center of Cagayan Valley\\" because of the thousands of devotees and tourists who come here to pay homage. It is the home of Our Lady of Piat which continues to be the source of inspiration and object of devotion of many Catholics in the region. History There are quite a few conjectures on how Piat got its name. One has it is that it derives from \\"pias,\\" an Ilokano word, in Ibanag \\"addulu\\" and in Tagalog, \\"kamiyas.\\" Another has it that the word comes from \\"aggapiya,\\" meaning \\"healer, masseuse,\\" and a more credible version has it that it is derived from the Ibanag and Itawes word \\"piya\\" which means \\"goodness, kindness, health.\\" The original people were the Itawes; at present, there are many Ibanag. Ilokano, Tagalog, Kapampangan and other dialect speakers. There are also families of Spanish and American descent. The head of the family was called \\"urayan\\" or \\"baruwang\\" and the council of elders \\"Kammaranan.\\" There were also war leaders and braves called \\"mengal,\\" and priestesses called \\"anitera\\" from the Spanish word called \\"anito\\" or \\"minangilu\\" in Ibanag, \\"mangilut\\" in Itawes and \\"baybaylan\\" in Bisayan; there were few priests among the ancient people. In 1596, the Dominican Provincial, Fr. Miguel de San Jacinto named Piat as a mission in the Itawes region comprising the towns of Tabang, Malaueg, Tuao and Piat. The encomenderos then were Pedro Barreda, Juan de Arranda and Isabel de Cardona. In 1604, the Bishop, Diego de Soria, negotiated for more missionaries for the Itawes region. To help in the pacification and evangelization of the region, the Dominicans introduced the devotion to Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary: in 1604, they brought the images of Our Lady from Macau and first enshrined it in Lallo, later bringing it to Piat 1622.

Their hangouts, two high mountains and a steep trail called \\"escolta\\" from where they uprooted trees to hurl at one another, can still be seen in Malaueg (Rizal). Local crops are corn, rice and tobacco. It is known before of its specie as \\"Matalag\\", which means men and women alike to go for its aroma and suaveness. Its bananas and mangoes have become a good source of revenue. History =Spanish regime= Malaueg church The incorporation of the town was dated early 1500s during the Spanish era in the Philippines. The name became permanently until 1903 when the town was renamed in the honor of the Philippine National Hero Dr. Jos√© Rizal. During the Spanish regime, the town was said to be the rest spots of the Spanish Authorities, friars and some locals, because of its cool environmental climate. Malaueg people build the largest stone convents for the friars, some nipa hut houses for Spanish Authorities and some ordinary houses for the locals. Malaueg became a center of Christianity next to Nueva Segovia after the Malaueg Church was built. In 1607 the area was the site of Caquenga's Revolt. With the creation of the Nueva Segovia diocese in 1595 in the Cagayan Valley, Catholic missionaries from Europe began flooding into the region to convert the indigenous inhabitants to the Catholic faith. Per the Dominican account, Pagulayan, the chief of Nalfotan, had tried contacting Catholic missionaries for years. Fray Pedro then accepted the invitation and went to Nalfotan to visit Pagulayan and the Malaueg people. To his astonishment, he found a church erected and the people waiting to adopt the religion. However, Caquenga, an indigenous animist leader, or priestess, apprehended the coming of the friar. Christianity posed a threat to her indigenous animism, and Catholic missionaries and Spanish officials worked continuously to eradicate animism. In response to this threat against her spiritual beliefs, she gathered a group of followers and they revolted against the priest.Fluckiger, \\"Caquenga.\\" =American period= During the American occupation of the Philippines, the town of Malaueg was also a favorite spot for the Americans. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the town was almost destroyed when the soldiers used its towering mountains to hide their ammunition and dug some trenches. The Authorities were very protective of the condition of the church during war. The town before had two municipalities, namely: Mauanan and Malaueg. The barrios on the western and northern part belonged to the municipality of Malaueg, while the barrios on the eastern part belonged to the municipality of Mauanan, where the seat of two municipal governments was established (Philippine Commission; Act nos. 943,944, 1903). Act no. 2390 changed the names of the municipalities of Santo Nino and Mauanan. The names of the municipalities of Santo Nino and Mauanan were changed to Faire and Rizal respectively. Mauanan was named Rizal in the year 1914 and the sitios of Lattut, Capacuaan and Macatal were annexed from Rippang in 1933, under executive Order No. 690 dated March 28, 1935. =Japanese occupation= During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, the town was largely destroyed in bombing attacks. The town also became one of the centers of resistance in the Philippines because of its forested areas that served as a hideout. =Assassination= On December 3, 2008, elected mayor Raul dela Cruz sustained bullet wounds to the body and died while being taken to the hospital in Tuguegarao City.http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20081204-175999/Cagayan- mayor-3-others-slain-in-ambush More violence took place on January 23, 2011, during the Town Fiesta, Police Commander Roweko and his wife together with six others were ambushed.

Transportation The Cagayan‚ÄìApayao Road connects Rizal and nearby Conner to the neighboring towns of Tuao, Piat, Solana and Tuguegarao City. The road from Tuao to Rizal is rough and can take up to one-half-hours. It will take another half-hour ride from Tuguegarao to Tuao. The provincial road was opened in 1951. From 1951 to 1986, one had to cross the Matalag River with a ferry boat made out of bamboos and drum. The ferry boat loaded only one jeep or bus at a time. Traveling to Rizal from Tuao to Tuguegarao or vice versa in those days was slow and tiresome because it took the ferry boat almost an hour to ferry its load to and from the other side of the river. Vehicles were ferried on a first-come, first-served basis. The roads to the town are along the edge of the mountain, having hairpin turns and in other barangays, the road is at the edge of the Matalag River and some are at the middle of the fields.

Some fishermen from Minanga ( a barrio of Gonzaga) came and settled in Palawig. In 1891, Felipe Agarpao with some settlers organized a \\"gimong\\" (society) called \\"Inanama.\\" The purpose of the organisation was to acquire and occupy lands around the place. That same year, Briccio Campa√±ano of Lapog, Ilocos Sur together with some others from Ilocos came to Palawig to apply for homesteads in the sitio of Marede. These settlers organized another \\"gimong\\" called \\"Dagupan.\\" In 1900, the woodcutters from Aparri led by Don Julian Astigarraga arrived by the first boat. Thus, began the clearing of settlements. From 1919 to 1935 several group of settlers from the Ilocos Region came to claim lands aboard virays (light seagoing boats). The once-forested areas were accessible only via rivers and the sea. Before reaching the settlements in the northern and eastern portions, they had to navigate through Palawig River. The name Palawig was coined from the local term pasawig, meaning mouth of the river. In 1935, the gimongs \\"Inanama and Dagupan\\" fused into one called \\"Da Inanama,\\" headed by Navarro, they began to work for the separation of Palawig as a municipality independent from Gonzaga. Their application was held in abeyance because their population did not meet the needed number required by law. The move was suspended in 1941 and when World War II broke out the move was not carried out. Barrio Palawig and its neighbouring barrios were separated from Gonzaga and the town was created by President Elpidio Quirino via Executive Order No. 289 (21 October 1949). Contrary to the usual assumption, it is not named for Saint Anne but is an acronym of the surnames of the then-three provincial officials: Governor Nicasio _A_ rranz; and Provincial Board members Federico _N_ avarro; and Roberto _A_ vena. The association to the saint was a back- formation in keeping with traditional Hispanicised toponyms. Demographics In the , the population of Santa Ana, Cagayan, was people, with a density of .

Beach volleybelles Charo Soriano, who is a native from Tuguegarao, and Filipino- American Alexa Micek won the third leg of the BVR On Tour. Festivities Every May 26 to May 30 of the year, the town plays host to the Viray Festival, organized by the local government with the support of the regional tourism office and the private sector. Launched in June 2005, the Viray Festival was conceptualized to dramatize the significance of the viray, which played a key role in the lives and history of the town. A viray is a large wooden flat boat which, before the use of gasoline-fed engines in the early 1950s, was propelled by sails. Comerciantes (traders) used large virays measuring long, wide and high. Fishermen, on the other hand, used smaller ones, usually long, wide and high. Equipped with oars to reach nearby fishing grounds, these types sailed for longer distances. Due to its capacity to carry great quantities of cargo, viray was the only means of transport used by the first settlers of Santa Ana. Leaders and well-off families derived income from the services of the viray ranging from fishing operation, commerce and trade to means of transport during the years when Santa Ana was at its prime. Used for daklis (trawl net), sapiao (net) and sirut (ring net) fishing, viray could carry the fishing gears, provisions, supplies, and manpower. It is assisted by small bancas during the fishing operation. An annual fluvial parade of colorful boats is held during the first day. The second day of the festival features a grand carabao parade where each of the 16 barangays composing the municipality has their turn to show off their artistic talents. On the third day, local folks and visitors alike line up along the main street to watch colorful bodies participating in the street dancing competition.

History  When the early Spanish missionaries were busy laying the foundation of a church late in the 16th century at a site about six kilometers from the present town of Tuao, a big bird came circling over them and then alighted on the wooden cross erected to mark the place where the cornerstone was laid. It flapped its wings noisily, cried \\"battuao, battuao, battuao\\" and then flew away. The native laborers in the construction stopped working and refused to continue telling the priests that the site had not been well chosen. They insisted that a party should find out where the bird had flown to. To humor the pagan natives, one of the priests allowed himself to be led by a party of natives to look for the mysterious bird. To his surprise, they found the bird serenely perched on top of a tall tree on the edge of a wide clearing ideal for a town site. He sent one of the natives to call for the other priests, who, on their arrival, found the place much to their liking. And so the first church of Tuao was constructed on the site where the present edifice now stands. When the civil authorities founded the town in 1604, the natives insisted that it be called Tuao. Eight years later on May 13, 1612, Tuao was accepted ecclesiastically. Father Miguel de San Jacinto, O.P. gave the town Santos Angeles Custudios (Holy Guardian Angels) as its patron saints. The early missionaries in Tuao were zealous evangelists and tactful pacifiers of warlike natives. One of them was Father Francisco Capillas, who later became the first martyr in China. The first parish priest, Father Juan B. Cano, O.P. worked patiently with the people. A late comer, Father Gabriel Serrano, O.P. built a strong brick and mortar church, a rectory (convento) and a fort (cotta) in which the Spaniards and the natives sought refuge every time the town was raided by the Kalingas from the Caraballo ranges. Unfortunately, these priceless monuments to the politicalization and evangelization of Tuao by the Spaniards were destroyed by a strong earthquake on December 29, 1749. In protest of abuses committed by some Spanish civil petty officials and soldiers, the inhabitants of Tuao and neighboring Malaueg, rose in revolt in 1781 under Magtangaga and Tomas Sinaguingan. The uprising was put down by Capitan Juan Pablo de Orduna. Tuao became a part of events during World War II as the seat of the successful renaissance government of Governor Marcelo Adduru. The Japanese Forces garrisoned the town when Adduru was captured late in 1943, but Adduru returned shortly after having been freed by his guerilla soldiers early in 1944.

Keen to follow in his father's footsteps, Stern graduated from the Ecole Sup√©rieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (ESSEC Business School) in Paris with a degree in finance before joining the family's private investment house in 1977. = Career = Aged 22, Stern took the reins of Banque Stern with a clear mandate to revitalize the nearly bankrupt institution. During the 1980s, Stern revamped the bank, expanding its activity in financial markets, as well as in mergers and acquisitions. In 1985, Stern sold the bank for 300 million francs ($60 million in 2005 dollars) to Lebanese investors. Thanks to a clause attached to the contract, Stern got to keep the copyright over his last name. Immediately after the sale went through, Stern started a new bank, with a similar name and business profile, drawing in many of his former clients. He sold this second institution for an estimated 1.75 billion francs in 1988 to the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBS, which will later merge with UBS to form UBS S.A.). As a result of these transactions, Stern shot up the ranks of the richest families in France, occupying the 38th spot, according to Forbes. In 1992, he joined Lazard Fr√®res as managing partner and quickly became one of the firm's star bankers and heir-apparent. He tried to reduce overhead and bring in younger partners but clashed with Michel David- Weill, the bank's head and his father-in-law. He quit Lazard Fr√®res in 1997 and set up his own investment fund, Investment Real Returns (IRR). He owned half and the remainder was held by Eurazeo, a Lazard holding company and Mainz Holdings Ltd., a U.S. Virgin Islands firm that Stern wholly owned. He maintained cordial relations with David-Weill, who invested $300 million in IRR. In 2000, Stern bought shares in the London-based Delta PLC, an international engineering group that was revising its corporate strategy. His stake eventually increased to 26% and after applying considerable pressure, he was named non-executive chairman on 31 December 2003. In October 2003, Stern sued Rhodia, alleging false accounting and insider dealing. Report on Stock Market MalpracticeAfter Stern's death, Delta was taken over by the US company, Valmont. During his almost three decade long career, Stern amassed a fortune of more than a $1 billion through a series of \\"often brilliant business deals\\". His banking style was considered revolutionary for France's so-called \\"cozy capitalism\\", as Stern honed his skill at engineering hostile takeovers. = Death = On 28 February 2005 Stern was found dead in his apartment in Geneva, his body riddled with bullets. He was found in the bedroom, in a flesh-coloured head-to-toe latex suit. Swiss authorities arrested his long- time lover, C√©cile Brossard, over the killing.

It is locally known for its pancit Cabagan. Its people are called Ybanags. Nowadays, Ybanags are well educated and the source of the province's top politicians, professionals and a world class athlete. During Christmas, the Cabagan Square Park can be seen flashing brightly with many Christmas lights and lanterns. The carousel in Cabagan Square Park has been dubbed by the townspeople as the largest in the Philippines. Malasi Lake is a sanctuary for migratory birds located in barangay San Antonio. The biggest gymnasium in Isabela and in the whole Region 2 is located in this town, as well as a century-old well that was built by the Spaniards, located at St. Ferdinand College, Cabagan Campus. History Etymologically, the name Cabagan may have originated from the native word bag or bajaque, not because \\"G-strings\\" were used here or made in Cabagan, but most probably because there were stores in the village. Cabagan could have also been derived from the word cabbagang, meaning \\"pilgrim\\" or \\"stranger\\". Based on the fact that Cabagan at the time was in constant contact with members of the \\"pagan tribes\\" from Diffun, namely southern Isabela as well as with the \\"Kalingas\\", of the neighboring Cordillera mountains. =Various Cabagan= The Cabagan of old, that existed from 1646 to 1877 was simply called, \\"Cabagan\\". In 1877, the Spaniards decided to transfer present-day Cabagan to a new site, abandoning the old Cabagan. In 1888, the Spaniards resurrected the abandoned Cabagan, into a new town. With this development, there were now two Cabagans. The Spaniards rectified the predicament by naming the first Cabagan as Cabagan Viejo, and the second Cabagan as Cabagan Nuevo or the new Cabagan. Apparently, the name was not to the liking of the new rulers, the Americans. When the Americans came to rule the Philippines after the Spaniards, they renamed Cabagan Nuevo as simply \\"Cabagan\\", and the old namesake, as the town of San Pablo. =Foundation= The old Cabagan, Cabagan Viejo which is now called \\"San Pablo\\", was the key town in the colonization of the Irrayas and to some extent Diffun, i.e., southern Isabela. The Irraya rebelled and the only ones that the Spaniards could claim, were some three hundred families who agreed to establish the village of Maquilla, near Tuguegarao City. Cabagan became a charter town on November 30, 1646 and ecclesiastically on May 15, 1647 with Saint Paul the Apostle as the patron saint. =New Cabagan (Cabagan Nuevo)= The new Cabagan came to exist, because the Spanish government decreed that on January 25, 1877, the old Cabagan or San Pablo of today, be transferred from its old site, to the one that is now occupying. The brainchild of the transfer of Cabagan, was parish priest Pedro Ricart, who then made representations with the Spanish government, for the transfer. Father Jose Burgues History of Cagayan Valley gave the unhealthiness of the old site, the reason for the transfer. Others had stated though, that Cabagan was transferred because progress appeared to be bypassing the old Cabagan, in favor of the villages to the south, near Cabagan's present site. The new site was the area between the villages of Ugad and Luquilu, villages that exists up to this day. The site is not far from the old, with the church of the new Cabagan just some three kilometers or so, south from that of the old. The transfer was not without friction though. A number of Cabagan's inhabitants opposed the transfer. But the missionary's will had prevailed. In contempt, as it were of the natives' opposition, the missionary uprooted the Church of the old Cabagan and brought the images and other vestments, to the new Cabagan. When the Spaniards established a new town, they also endeavored to build a massive church and convent made of stone, brick and mortar. From 1877, when the new Cabagan was established, and culminating with the Philippine Revolution that deposed the ruling Spaniards 19 years later (1896), the then governing Spaniards were still not able to complete all constructions needed, for the new Cabagan. Cabagan is a known meeting place among revolutionaries during the Spanish occupation. Geography Cabagan is a land-locked municipality in the Cagayan River valley in the north of Luzon Island. The town center is located on the eastern banks of the Cagayan River. =Barangays= Cabagan is politically subdivided into 26 barangays. =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Cabagan, Isabela, was people, with a density of . =Language= Cabagan was part of the Irraya region and its language was Irraya. The Spaniards however, made the Ibanag language \\"The official language of the Valley\\", and had exerted all efforts to make everyone speak the dialect. Since then, the Irraya tongue gradually disappeared from the Cabagan psyche. When people uttered Irraya before, they were discouraged or forbidden to speak, because that was the language of the \\"pagans\\" at the time, the Kalingas. Whenever the townsfolk enter the poblacion, none would speak of Irraya, for they would be considered despicably as, a \\"Kalinga\\" or as \\"ignorant persons\\", living in the mountains. Today, no one speaks Irraya. There are however, a few barrios in Cabagan today, like San Bernardo and Tallag, wherein the Ibanag dialect gets interspersed with Irraya. However, some older generation townsfolk, could also remember sentences in Irraya. Ilocano is also spoken in parts of Cabagan because of migration of poor Ilocanos from other parts of Luzon to seek opportunities. Attractions * Cabagan is famous for its eponymously named 'Pansit Cabagan', a local dish which was introduced by a Chinese trader in 1887 and has gained popularity in different parts of Luzon.

It was actually the fourth symphony composed by Bruckner, after the Symphony in F minor (1863), the Symphony No. 1 in C minor (1866), and the Symphony in D minor (1869).  History  In the fall of 1871, after having become established in Vienna, Anton Bruckner embarked on a new symphonic project, his fourth, which in less than a year would result in a completed and copied score of nearly 2000 bars. The Symphony No. 2, which was mostly written in the summer of 1872, represents a breakthrough in Bruckner‚Äôs conception of the symphony. Although Bruckner had been composing sonata-form movements with three distinct themes since he began writing symphonies in 1862, in 1872 he greatly expanded the scope of their presentation and development, and established the framework, which he would use consistently in all of his subsequent symphonic work. Moreover, the Adagio of this symphony is in ABA‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤A‚Ä≥ Lied form followed by a coda ‚Äì the framework which Bruckner would use in his subsequent symphonic work, with exception of the Sixth. The Second Symphony is the only numbered Bruckner symphony without a dedication; Franz Liszt tacitly rejected the dedication, and Richard Wagner chose the Symphony No. 3 in D minor when offered both works. The symphony was planned to be performed in the same year by the Vienna Philharmonic under Otto Dessoff. However, the rehearsal did not lead to a performance, because Dessoff and a number of players considered it impossible to perform. Nevertheless, the symphony was premiered the following year, on 26 October 1873, by the Vienna Philharmonic with Bruckner himself on the podium.  Description  The score calls for a pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings. The symphony has four movements. In the first version (1872) they are: In the second version (1877) they are: The description below will use the tempo markings of the latter version. = First movement = The symphony opens with tremolo strings and the lyrical main theme emerges from under this: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Moderato\\" 2 = 60 \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. \\\\p :8 } \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 }  % 2 \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 } \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 }  % 3 \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 } \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 }  % 4 \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 } \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 }  % 5 \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 } \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 }  % 6 \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 } \\\\times 4/6 { 2\\\\. :8 } } ew Staff \\\\relative as' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 R1*2  % 3 as2. \\\\mf \\\\< ( g4 )  % 4 fis2 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> ( g4 ) r4 \\\\\\\\!  % 5 as2 \\\\< ( ~ as8 g8 f8 es8 )  % 6 f4 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> ( fis4 g4 ) r4 \\\\\\\\! } >> } Note that although there is tremolo, it is a somewhat slower tremolo than what Bruckner would employ in later symphonies. Shortly after this, an \\"enigmatic\\" trumpet call appears: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 60 c4. c8 \\\\times 2/3 { c4. c8 c4 }  % 2 c4. c8 \\\\times 2/3 { c4. c8 c4 }  % 3 g4 r4 r2 } >> } This rhythm is an important device and will recur throughout the movement. The first theme group closes with one of the symphony's characteristic pauses and leads to the second theme group in E flat major: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 60 \\\\relative g' { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\stemUp \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\time 2/2  % 1 g4 \\\\p ( bes,4 ) bes'4 ( bes,4 )  % 2 as'4 -! bes,4 ( d4 bes'4 )  % 3 g4 ( bes,4 ) bes'4 ( bes,4 )  % 4 as'4 -! bes,4 ^( d4 bes'4 )  % 5 g4 ^( bes,4 ) bes'4 ^( bes,4 )  % 6 as'4 -! bes,4 ^( d4 bes'4 )  % 7 bes4 r4 r2 } \\\\relative bes { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\stemDown \\\\time 2/2  % 1 s1*3  % 4 r2 bes2 _~  % 5 bes2 bes2 _~  % 6 bes2 bes2 _~  % 7 bes4 s4 s2 } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\relative es, { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\stemDown \\\\time 2/2 es4 r4 g4 r4  % 2 f4 r4 bes,4 r4  % 3 es4 r4 g4 \\\\mf r4  % 4 f4 r4 bes,4 r4  % 5 es4 r4 g4 r4  % 6 f4 r4 bes,4 r4  % 7 es4 r4 r2 } \\\\relative bes { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\stemUp \\\\time 2/2 s2*4  % 3 r2 bes2 ~  % 4 bes2 c4 d4  % 5 es1 ~  % 6 es4 d4 c4 d4  % 7 es2 s4 s4 } >> >> } The third theme group is also in E major: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative bes' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 60 R1*2\\\\p  % 3 r4 2 4 ~ ~  % 4 4 2 ( 4 )  % 5 4 2 ( 4 ) ~ ~  % 6 4 4 2 } ew Staff \\\\relative es { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 4 \\\\p -! 8 ( 8 4 ) -! 8 ( 8  % 2 4 ) -! 8 ( 8 4 ) -! 8 ( 8  % 3 4 ) -! 8 ( 8 4 ) -! 8 ( 8  % 4 4 ) -! 8 ( 8 4 ) -! 8 ( 8  % 5 4 ) -! 8 ( 8 4 ) -! 8 ( 8  % 6 4 ) -! 8 ( 8 4 ) -! r4 \\\\\\\\! } >> } The trumpet call from the first group recurs here. The movement heads into its development after a brief codetta. The recapitulation opens just as the exposition did; with tremolo strings giving way to the main theme and the reappearance of the trumpet call. At the end, there is a brief recollection of the main theme before a grand peroration closes the movement. The first part of the coda is cut in the second version. = Scherzo (Second in 1872, Third in 1877) = In the first version, both sections of the Scherzo and both sections of the Trio are repeated. These repeats were excised in the second version. The Scherzo is based on rhythmic theme heard at the outset: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"M√§√üig schnell\\" 4 = 245 8 \\\\ff **8 4 4  % 2 4 4 r4  % 3 8 8 4 4  % 4 4 4 r4 } ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef bass \\\\time 3/4 8 \\\\ff **8 4 4  % 2 4 4 r4  % 3 8 8 4 4  % 4 4 4 r4 } >> } The Trio is based on a \\"tipsy\\" melody in the violas: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Gleiches tempo\\" 4 = 190 2\\\\. \\\\p :16  % 2 2\\\\. :16  % 3 2\\\\. :16  % 4 2\\\\. :16 % 5 2\\\\. :16  % 6 2\\\\. :16 } ew Staff \\\\relative e' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 R2.*2  % 3 e2 \\\\mf ( f4 )  % 4 e2 ( d4 )  % 5 e4 \\\\< ( g4 e'4 )  % 6 e4 r2 \\\\\\\\! } >> } = Adagio/Andante (Third in 1872, Second in 1877) = This movement opens quietly with the strings: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Feierlich, etwas bewegt\\" 4 = 40 \\\\relative es { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\stemUp \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\time 4/4  % 1 r2 \\\\p es2  % 2 es,2 -> des8 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {cresc.} } f8 g8 as8  % 3 bes2 des4. ^( c8 )  % 4 c2 r2 } \\\\relative c { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\stemDown \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4  % 1 c2 as2_~  % 2 as2 f2  % 3 es1 _~  % 4 es2 s2 } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\relative es' { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\stemUp \\\\time 4/4 es2 \\\\p c2  % 2 as2 des2 ^~  % 3 des2 bes2  % 4 c2 r2 } \\\\relative as { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\stemDown \\\\key as \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 as2 es2  % 2 f1  % 3 g2 bes2  % 4 as2 s2 } >> >> } This movement is the first Bruckner slow movement in five-part ternary form and so this part will recur twice.

The latter half contained a decorated restatement of the horn theme. However, the fourth part of the movement contains a similar (But not identical) passage in both versions. Near the end of the movement, Bruckner quotes from the Benedictus of his F minor Mass before the main theme begins the coda: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 40 \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\stemUp \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\time 4/4  % 1 r2 \\\\p r4 c4  % 2 g'4. ^( as8 ) as4 es4 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {cresc.} }  % 3 bes'4. ^( c8 ) c4 es4  % 4 des4 c8 as8 f8 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {dim.} } g8 as8 bes8  % 5 bes2 \\\\pp as2 ^~  % 6 as2 r2 } \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\stemDown \\\\key as \\\\major \\\\time 4/4  % 1 s2 s4 c4 _~  % 2 c8 c8 _( des8 c8 des8 c8 ) es4 _~  % 3 es8 es8 _( fes8 es8 fes8 es8 ) ges4  % 4 f8 g8 as4 as,4 f'4  % 5 es1 _~  % 6 es1 } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\stemDown \\\\time 4/4 r2 \\\\p r4 c4 _~  % 2 c8 c8 _( des8 c8 des8 c8 ) es4 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {cresc.} } _~  % 3 es8 es8 _( fes8 es8 fes8 es8 ) r4  % 4 r4 es'2 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {dim.} } des4  % 5 des2 \\\\pp c2 _~  % 6 c2 r2 } \\\\relative g { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\stemUp \\\\key as \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 s2 s4 g4  % 2 g2 as4 bes4  % 3 bes2 c2  % 4 des4 es4 r2  % 5 es,1 } >> >> } = Fourth movement = The movement opens quietly with the second violins playing an eighth-note accompaniment and the first violins playing a descending scale: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative as { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Mehr schnell\\" 2 = 95 R1  % 2 r2 \\\\p r4 as8 r8  % 3 g8 r8 f8 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {dim.} } r8 es8 r8 d8 r8  % 4 c8 r8 r4 r2 } ew Staff \\\\relative g' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 r8 \\\\p g8 ( fis8 g8 as8 g8 fis8 g8 )  % 2 as8 ( -> g8 fis8 g8 ) fis8 ( g8 f8 g8 )  % 3 es8 ( g8 f8 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {dim.} } g8 ) fis8 ( g8 f8 g8 )  % 4 es8 g8 ( fis8 g8 as8 -> g8 fis8 g8 ) } >> } This leads to the second theme of the first theme group, a loud passage given by the full orchestra that will recur as the main theme of the third theme group: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 95 \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\times 2/3 { 8 \\\\ff 8 8 } 4 r4 4  % 2 \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\times 2/3 { 8 8 8 } 4 r4 es4  % 3 \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\times 2/3 { 8 8 8 } 4 4 4  % 4 2\\\\. 4  % 5 \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\times 2/3 { 8 8 8 } 4 4 4  % 6 2\\\\. r4 } ew Staff \\\\relative g { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\times 2/3 { 8 \\\\ff 8 8 } 4 r4 4  % 2 \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\times 2/3 { 8 8 8 } 4 r4 es4 d4 g,4 d'4 es4  % 4 d4 g,4 d'4 f4  % 5 es4 g,4 es'4 f4  % 6 es4 r4 r2 } >> } The quiet opening returns after this and leads into the A major second theme group, called \\"Schubertian\\" by Georg Tintner: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative cis { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 90 cis4 \\\\pp ( d4 cis4 e,4 )  % 2 d4 ( b'4 cis,4 a'4 )  % 3 gis4 ( a4 gis4 b,4 )  % 4 a4 ( fis'4 gis,4 e'4 ) } ew Staff \\\\relative a, { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 a4 \\\\pp ^\\"pizz.\\" r4 a'4 r4  % 2 e4 r4 a,4 r4  % 3 e4 r4 e'4 r4  % 4 b4 r4 e,4 r4 } >> } The exposition closes with a quote of the Kyrie of the F minor Mass. The development contains what William Carragan refers to as \\"fantasies\\" on the first and second theme groups. The recapitulation begins with the loud secondary theme of the first group before moving into the quieter first theme. Among other cuts between versions, one of note is in the coda of the movement. In the original version the coda is in two phases; a buildup leading to quotations of the first movement and the second theme group of this movement. This leads to the second phase, another buildup leading to the grand peroration in C major that closes the symphony. The first of these phases is cut in the second version, leaving only the final buildup and peroration.  Versions  The composer made two versions of this symphony recognised by the Internationale Bruckner- Gesellschaft (1872 and 1877). The work was also adjusted by the composer right before its premiere, as well as in 1876 and 1892. = First version, 1872 = This was published in a 2005 edition by William Carragan under the auspices of the Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft in 2005. The Scherzo comes second; the slow movement follows. Georg Tintner: ‚ÄúBruckner‚Äôs mania for revision sometimes bore positive fruits ‚Ä¶ [but with] the Second and the Third [symphonies] his first versions seem to me the best.‚Äù  1873 revision  Bruckner made adjustments preparing for the 1873 premiere. *First movement: Rhythmic trombones were added on bars 129‚Äì135 and 446‚Äì452. *Adagio: In the fifth section a solo violin was added from bar 150 to bar 164. During the rehearsal, violin soloist Heinz Haunold told: \\"‚Ä¶ the violin solo at that point of the movement effectively prevented the orchestra from rising to the great climax ‚Ä¶ but it also contained a fatal trap for the performers of the symphony.\\" > The violin solo ‚Ä¶ in duple quarters and duple eighths, ‚Ä¶ together with the > rhythmic complexities already caused by the shift from sextuplets to > quintuplets in the first violins, ‚Ä¶ must have created an amazingly detailed > sound ‚Äì not to say an impenetrable musical fog.\\" :In the coda, the solo horn, which was considered unplayable by the horn- player, was replaced by the first clarinet and the viola section. *Scherzo: The repeats were deleted. *Finale: A \\"very dissonant section of the development\\", which includes at one point a striking alternation of short viola notes with pizzicato chords in the rest of the strings, was removed. These original bold and adventurous bars 305‚Äì360 were substituted for a new, 24-bar, very charming \\"\\" (new passage). In the peroration, a fourth trombone is added to enhance the contrabass part.  1876 revision  In 1876, Bruckner made additional, smaller changes prior the second performance, which occurred on 20 February 1876 in the Musikvereinsaal under Bruckner's baton. Bruckner made mainly cuts in the coda of the first movement, and in the development of the second theme and the coda of the Finale. The peroration of the Finale is recomposed and the additional trombone is removed. = Second Version, 1877 = Bruckner crossed out the second half of section 2 of the slow movement, judged too difficult for the solo horn ‚Äì with, as a result, an imbalance in the structure of the movement ‚Äì and re-orchestrated its section 5. He also made additional cuts in the first movement and the Finale, and dropped the ‚ÄúNeuer Satz‚Äú and substituted it for an 18-bar long, new material. *Haas edition (1938): this edition is based on the 1877 version, with, however, some features of the first version. *Nowak edition (1965): this edition still contains residues of the Haas' \\"mixed version\\" - among others an error in the trumpet parts at the end of the first movement: *Carragan edition (2007): this edition is a critical edition of the 1877 version of the symphony. Carragan explained its origin: \\"After a bit of discussion, Hofrat Nowak asked me to prepare a new edition of the symphony for the Collected Edition, knowing, as many others did as well, that he had not dealt fully with the problems of the Haas edition in 1965.\\" :In his edition Carragan put the crossed-out second half of section 2 of the slow movement (bars 48‚Äì69) as optional, explaining, \\"In my edition of the Second I kept that music in the score, and borrowing from Haas marked it with a 'vide', to be retained at the conductor‚Äôs option. In the preface I point out that if the pure 1877 version of the symphony is desired, the cut must be made, but some conductors are keeping the music and in my opinion as a listener, the effect is better.\\"  1892 version  This, the first published edition of the symphony, was prepared by Cyrill Hynais and was until recently thought to be inauthentic, but Carragan has shown that it corresponds closely to the 1877 version. This version was performed on 25 November 1894 by the Vienna Philharmonic under Hans Richter.  Discography  The first recording of any part of the symphony was made by Fritz Zaun with the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in 1934: a cut version of the Scherzo in the 1892 first published edition. The oldest surviving complete performance is by Georg-Ludwig Jochum with the Bruckner Orchestra of Linz, dating from 1944 and using the Haas edition. The first commercial recording was by Volkmar Andreae with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra in 1953, also using the Haas edition. = First version, 1872 =  Carragan's edition  * Kurt Eichhorn conducting the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, 1991 (first recording, using a pre-publ.

Tr√∂ger's base and its analogs are soluble in various organic solvents and strong acidic aqueous solutions due to their protonation. History Tr√∂ger's original research in 1887 failed to elaborate the exact structure of his new product that lead Johannes Wislicenus, the departmental director of the time, to assign a mediocre grade for Tr√∂ger's thesis. Despite various possible structures had been drawn for Tr√∂ger's product, its correct structure remained as a mystery for 48 years, until the final elucidation in 1935 by Spielman.  Structure and chirality  Both enantiomers of Tr√∂ger's base: (5S,11S)-enantiomer (above) and (5R,11R)-enantiomer (below) The nitrogen inversion normally leads to a rapid equilibrium between the enantiomers of chiral amines, that prevents them showing any optical activity. The inversion can be stopped by conformational strain as Tr√∂ger's base has demonstrated that nitrogen is capable of forming a stereogenic center in organic molecules. In Tr√∂ger's base, this inversion is not possible, and the nitrogen atoms are defined stereogenic centers. The separation of the enantiomers of Tr√∂ger's base was first accomplished by Vladimir Prelog in 1944. Prelog performed column chromatography using a chiral stationary phase as a relatively new method that later on gained popularity and became a standard procedure. Tr√∂ger's base and its analogs can be resolved by various methods including chiral HPLC or be made as a single enantiomer. Almost 30 years after Tr√∂ger's initial report, H√ºnlich described another mysterious product obtained from the condensation of formaldehyde and 2,4-diaminotoluene. After almost a century the structure of H√ºnlich's product was elucidated by X-ray crystallography as a C2-symmetric amine-carrying analogue of Tr√∂ger's base. Tr√∂ger's base is a diamine, which exceptionally exhibits chirality due to the prevented inversion of configuration of two bridgehead stereogenic tertiary amine groups. Tr√∂ger's base and its analogs racemize under acidic conditions through the formation of iminium intermediates, that can be prevented by the replacement of methano-bridge with an ethano-bridge. The molecule can be considered a molecular tweezer as the skeleton forces the molecule in a rigid locked conformation with the aromatic rings in 90 degree proximity. Applications optically active Tr√∂ger base analog forms self-organized helical superstructures that enables the shown LCD prototype to pass specific wavelengths of light through a pair of parallel (A) and crossed (B) linear polarizersTr√∂ger's base and its analogs have been used as chiral discriminators for the recognition of a variety of organic compounds and as ligand in inorganic chemistry. When the methyl groups are replaced by interactive groups such as carboxylic acids or pyridine amide groups a host‚Äìguest chemistry interaction can take place between the Tr√∂ger's base and other molecules including glycosaminoglycans. It is found that the cavity dimensions are optimal for inclusion of suberic acid but that with a longer acid sebacic acid or a shorter acid adipic acid the interaction is less favorable. 250x250px Chromophore carrying analogs of the Tr√∂ger's base have displayed unique NLO properties and can be used as molecular switches and liquid crystal dopants. Synthesis mechanism of formation of Tr√∂ger's base Tr√∂ger's base is of historic interest as was first synthesised in 1887 from p-toluidine and formaldehyde in acid solution by Julius Tr√∂ger. It can also be prepared with dimethyl sulfoxide and hydrochloric acid or hexamethylene tetraamine (HMTA) as formaldehyde replacement. The reaction mechanism with DMSO as methylene donor for this reaction is similar to that of the Pummerer rearrangement. The interaction of DMSO and hydrochloric acid yields an electrophilic sulfenium ion that reacts with the aromatic amine in an electrophilic addition. Methanethiol is eliminated and the resulting imine reacts with a second amine. Sulfenium ion addition and elimination is repeated with the second amino group and the imine group reacts in an intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Imine generation is repeated a third time and the reaction concludes with a second electrophilic substitution to the other aromat. Stereoselective, enantiospecific methods have also been introduced for the direct synthesis of optically active analogs of Tr√∂ger's base.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is one of only two towns in the Philippines named after William Atkinson Jones who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, the other being Banton, Romblon, which was renamed Jones in 1918 but reverted to its original name in 1959. History The southern portion of Echague separated by Cagayan River was created into a municipality named Jones in honor of an American Legislator, William Atkinson Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, and was inaugurated on January 1, 1921. It was originally composed of 21 barrios of virgin forest and wide fertile plains with Cabanuangan as the seat of the Municipal Government. The house of one Tirso Mateo served as the first town hall with the following as the first municipal officials; President;Don Antonio Vallejo, Vice President; Benito Tiburcio, Secretary; Francisco Gumpal; Treasurer Pio Tomines; Justice of Peace Daniel Apostol; Zoilo Gadingan, Chief of Police; and Modesto Payuyo, Antonio Pintang, Gregorio Santos, Dionicio Cristobal, Valentin Torio; and Damaso Leano as Councilors. The first proposed town site of Jones was in Barangay Daligan, but due to the insistence of the Municipal President Don. Antonio Vallejo who voluntarily donated two hectares of land for the municipal hall and public market site, he also later donated the vast fertile land area of Jones Rural School and Jones North Central School hence the present site of Barangay I and II. Transportation was then a big problem as there were no good roads, the barrios being only connected by narrow roads and trails suited for hiking, for horse and carabao and for sled and cart. During rainy days, these roads and trails easily turned into knee-deep mud fit only for wallowing carabaos. The principal means of transportation was the Cagayan River passing almost all the barrios, using raft and boats. It was only after about eight years of existence that more vehicles applied between Jones and Echague. The vast virgin forest and fertile soil of the place was pioneered by enterprising Ilocanos from the Ilocos Province, particularly from Ilocos Norte and some Yogads who are natives of Cagayan Valley. Other ethnic groups followed like the Ibanags and some Tagalogs from Central Luzon. The Aglipayan Church (Philippine Independent Catholic Church) was the first established church. There were very few primary schools, all hinged to an intermediate school called Jones Farm School at the Poblacion. The early inhabitants concentrated on agriculture with tobacco and corn as the chief crop. Revenue principally came from the real property tax, cedula and sled tax. The town was greatly dependent on national aid. The town holds a special place in the history of Isabela. When the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the Philippines in 1914, JONES was a shelter for the National and Provincial officials and evacuees from other places up to 1942. The town likewise became the provincial seat of the Provincial Government during the wartorn years from 1941 to 1942. It was subsequently occupied by the Japanese forces but it continued to be a stronghold of Filipino and American Guerillas led by the brave soldiers under the command of the Brigadier General Guillermo Nakar. On 1945, Filipino troops of the 2nd, USAFFE 11th, 12th and 13th Infantry Division and the USAFIP-NL 11th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 1st Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated and recaptured the entering towns in Jones, Isabela and helping recognized guerrilla units and defeated and attacking Japanese Imperial Army forces and ended in World War II. Jones is the home of Silvino M. Gumpal, who ably led the Province as Provincial Governor from 1946 to 1951 and who represented Isabela in Congress from 1934 to 1935. In 1959, the name of barrio Mangaratungat was changed to San Vicente. Jones has two new steel bridges worth P300M.

There are more or less 700 family heads of inhabitants in the barangay and they are classified into four ethnic groups which are the Ilokos, Ifugaos, Igorots and Gaddangs. Agricultural products such as corn, cassava, banana and rice are the source of income of the Dicamay people. Sibsib falls is the known tourist spot in Dicamay 2 which is 4 km from the barangay proper. It is a great place for bonding. Many visitors from other towns and barangays enjoy the beauty and freshness of air and water in the falls. Dicamay people also celebrates the Banana ‚ÄúSaba‚Äù festival in the month of May.

Demographics In the , the population of Jones, Isabela, was people, with a density of . There was originally a population of Agta living in the vicinity of Jones, along the Dicamay River. The Agta are one of the many groups known as 'Negritos' and who are descended from the pre-Austronesian population of the islands. The Dicamay Agta, who combined hunter-gathering with swidden agriculture, have been severely impacted by the influx of other ethnic groups to take up farming land in the area, resulting in there being no Agta living in the area today. There are numerous reports of the Agta having been driven off their lands, and in some cases of having been killed by immigrant groups of farmers. Climate  Economy  Jones is primarily an agricultural municipality best suited for the intensive production of rice and corn as evidence by its topographic map which shows that 73% of the agricultural area of 16,848 hectares is under 0-3 slope category.

The area was first mentioned by Fray Pedro de Santo Tomas as the area to which the Irray/Gaddang fled after the revolt of Dayag and Catabay in 1621 in what is now Ilagan City. In 1939, then President Manuel L. Quezon declared the westernmost part of the province as a resettlement area, historically known as the Mallig Plains Resettlement Area. From then on, the influx of settlers from the Central Plains and the Ilocos Region encouraged more other settlers to migrate westward in these Kalinga- dominated plains. Mallig was created by virtue of RA 678 authored in 1952 by congressman Samuel F. Reyes. The act was approved on April 8, 1953 with the former barangay Olango as the seat of government. The territory comprising Mallig was taken from several neighboring towns: * from Roxas: barangay of Holy Friday, San Jose (East), and San Jose (West) * from Ilagan City: barangay of Casili, Olango Primero, Olango Segundo, San Jose Nuevo, and Manano * from Tumauini: barangay of Barucbuc, Siempre Viva, Bimmonton, Pasurgong, Manga, and Settlement No. 1 * from Santo Tomas: barangay of Abut and Minagbag Mallig was never a ready haven and abode for the migrants at the beginning, particularly because of the hostile natives who formerly dominated the area, and also because of the occurrence of endemic malaria. It took the settlers gradual adaptation and acclimatization before they finally convinced their relatives and other migrants to settle permanently. Geography Mallig is bounded by the towns of Paracelis, Mt. Province on its western limits, Quezon, Isabela on its northern limits, Roxas, Isabela on its southern limits and by both Delfin Albano and Quirino, Isabela on its eastern limits. It is municipality within the Division/Province of Isabela in the region of Cagayan Valley. Its main gateway is the Santiago-Tuguegarao road which is a part of the national highway. The Ilagan-Delfin Albano-Mallig road, a provincial road, also serves as an important point of entry to Mallig. It is also an agricultural town mainly composed of agricultural farms such as rice fields and corn fields which makes its rural landscape. Barangays Mallig is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. =Climate= The climate in Mallig is tropical. Mallig has significant rainfall most months, with a short dry season. This location is classified as Am by K√∂ppen and Geiger. The temperature here averages 27.0 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall is 1784 mm.

The site features rose, bee, herb, wedding, and perennial gardens; an arboretum; an art gallery; and a LEED-certified Visitor & Administration Building. Queens Botanical Garden is located on property owned by the City of New York, and is funded from several public and private sources. It is operated by Queens Botanical Garden Society, Inc. Queens Botanical Garden was created as part of the 1939 New York World's Fair and was originally located in nearby Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park. It moved to its current location, a landfilled area east of Flushing Meadows Park, in 1963 in preparation for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Since then, the Queens Botanical Garden has continued to expand, with programming targeted at residents of surrounding community. In 2001, the Queens Botanical Garden Society published a master plan for a renovation of the garden, centered around the garden's location above the underground Kissena Creek. Several improvements were made over the following years, including the construction of a new environmentally friendly parking lot and administration building.  Mission statement   History  = Creation and site = The gate leading into the Gardens on Parade during the 1939 New York World's Fair During the 1939 New York World's Fair, held in adjacent Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, what would become the Queens Botanical Garden was a horticultural exhibit of the fair called \\"Gardens on Parade\\" operated by Hortus, Incorporated. The original gardens were located just west of the modern site at the northeast corner of the fair grounds, at 131st Street between Lawrence Street and the Flushing River in the path of the future Van Wyck Expressway. A New York City Department of Sanitation garage at Dahlia Avenue was located west of Main Street, in the modern Queens Botanical Garden. By the 1950s it had been abandoned, and there were calls to demolish it. A playground located at Elder Avenue and 135th Street in what in now the Queens Botanical Garden, was originally set to be complete by March 1957. However, by March 11, only a comfort station and lights were constructed, while the site required significant filling before development could occur. According to the Parks Department, the project was delayed due to bad weather. The playground site was used as dumping ground, and it was filled with dirt after community petition. After a three month delay, the playground was completed in June 1957. =Relocation= Prior to the 1964‚Äì1965 New York World's Fair, the western portion of Kissena Corridor Park between Lawrence Street / College Point Boulevard and Main Street adjacent to Flushing Meadows Park was leased to the World's Fair Corporation, along with most of Flushing Meadows. In 1961, as part of a $3 million development for the World's Fair, the Queens Botanical Garden was planned to be relocated from the fair grounds in Flushing Meadows to a site across College Point Boulevard to the east, within the current Kissena Corridor Park and adjacent to the World's Fair grounds. This tract was described as \\" of bogs and dump land\\". The project included a new administration building, to cost $150,000, and a pedestrian overpass over Lawrence Street leading to Flushing Meadows. The existing garden in Flushing Meadows would be demolished to make way for new fair exhibits, and the extension of the Van Wyck Expressway north through the park to the Whitestone Expressway. This site was originally planned to be used as parking space for the fair. Grading work for the project began on March 22, 1961. The Board of Estimate approved the Botanical Garden project and other World's Fair projects in September 23, 1961. At the time, the work for the gardens was estimated to cost $341,700. Construction on the administration building began in 1962. The building was designed by the Brodsky, Hopf & Adler firm, which also designed terminals at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas. Landscaping work was done by Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano, who also designed the original 1939 World's Fair grounds and the 1964 layout for the fair. The section of Elder Avenue that ran southwest across the Corridor Park site between Main Street and Peck Avenue was de-mapped to integrate the land into the Botanical Gardens. Three Blue Atlas Cedar trees were transplanted from the original garden site to the new main entrance on Main Street. The new Queens Botanical Garden was dedicated on October 19, 1963. Following Queens Botanical Garden's completion, New York City Parks commissioner Robert Moses unveiled an expanded plan for Kissena Corridor. The plan also included the Queens Zoo, to be built adjacent to the Queens Botanical Garden and operated by the Queens Botanical Garden Society. The zoo was expected to be complete by spring 1967, but ultimately opened in October 1968. = Late 20th century = A fountain at Queens Botanical Garden By 1972, the garden was averaging 300,000 visitors per year. The count included 50,000 students who had gone to the garden over the previous two years as part of various partnerships with Queens schools, or an average of 25,000 students annually. In the subsequent decades, the Queens Botanical Garden had various programs intended for members of the surrounding communities. In 1977, the garden hired a few dozen teenagers from schools in Queens to help plant trees, build a path, and restore part of an adjoining city park that had been vandalized. During the 1980s, the Queens Botanical Garden had several volunteers who would work with disabled teenagers. A sample of events from a 1979 newspaper article included an annual Environment Day and Senior Day; gardening classes; and a spring luncheon benefit. The Queens Botanical Garden had a senior garden, a children's garden, and community corn patches by 1982, as well as herb, bee, and bird gardens. The city took control of Queens Botanical Garden in 1992 after the previous director and twenty board members were ousted due to a dereliction of duties. The Queens Botanical Garden Society regained control in 1993, and Susan Lacerte was appointed as the garden's executive director. Shortly afterward, the Queens Botanical Garden Society began offering programs to the substantial Chinese, Korean, and Latin American populations of Flushing. In 1997, it was announced that a formal Korean garden would be planted in recognition of the Korean population in Flushing, which numbered more than 60,000 at the time. = 21st-century additions = In 1998, Queens Botanical Garden Society began devising a master plan for the garden. Details of the plan were released in 2001. The project would convert much of the garden into a landscaped green space surrounding a watercourse, as well as add sustainable energy features that would allow the garden to retain all of the rainwater that it collected. The master plan was designed by BKSK Architects, Conservation Design Forum, and Atelier Dreiseitl. The $70 million cost would be paid for by the city and state governments, though at the time, funding from both governments was limited due to budget cuts. The following year, a fence was erected around the garden at a cost of $3.9 million. The arboretum at the west end of Queens Botanical Garden, which was formerly accessible after the rest of the garden had closed, was now within the limits of the fence. A renovation of the rest of the garden was also undertaken at a cost of $68 million. The additions included a green roof above one building, solar panels, geothermal power generation systems, stormwater collection systems, and new wetlands and water features. On September 27, 2007, Queens Botanical Garden's new Visitor & Administration Building was opened. The center, designed by BKSK Architects, was the first building in New York City to achieve the \\"Platinum\\" LEED rating, the highest energy-efficiency rating possible.QBG Visitor & Administration Center, Flushing, USA Green Buildings Directory, Retrieved on October 2016. The new building was the first phase of the renovated garden to open. The renovation also included the construction of an environmentally friendly parking lot on the garden's north side, which was shaped around the surrounding land contours and contains a meadow that was designed to accommodate additional parking. In addition, an artificial wetland and \\"cleansing biotope\\" were constructed to collect stormwater in the garden. Description A pathway in Queens Botanical Garden Queens Botanical Garden is situated on an irregularly shaped plot in southern Flushing, in the central section of the New York City borough of Queens. It comprises of land bounded by Blossom Avenue, Cromellin Street, and Dahlia Avenue to the north; Main Street to the east; Peck, Elder, Booth Memorial Avenues and 133rd Street to the south; and College Point Boulevard to the west. Roughly are dedicated to outdoor exhibits. The garden charges no admission fee from November to March; for the rest of the year, various admission rates are charged. Queens Botanical Garden has a pedestrian entrance on Main Street, on its east side, and an entrance and parking lot at Cromellin Street, on its north side. The parking lot takes up much of the northwestern corner of Queens Botanical Garden. The visitor building and the gift shop and gallery are located on the north side of the Queens Botanical Garden. The majority of the public exhibits are located on the east side of the garden, where paths subdivide the land into smaller flower gardens. Various educational buildings, non-public structures, and the Compost Project Demonstration Site are located on the garden's north side. The Arboretum/Crabapple Grove and Meadow take up much of the southwest corner. Queens Botanical Garden is located in a dip that is lower than the surrounding streets. Most of the garden is atop landfill, which in turn covers the former Kissena Creek. As a result, water tends to flow downward from nearby areas toward the garden, and sinkholes previously tended to form inside the Queens Botanical Garden. Because of these qualities, The New York Times called the site, \\"hydrologically speaking ... a drainage ditch\\". The 2001 master plan called for redesigning the garden around the dip, and included five \\"systems\\" with a total of 27 water features. As part of the master plan, a \\"cleansing biotope\\" was built across the northern side of the Queens Botanical Garden. The site is often associated with the adjacent Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, to the west. Main Street separates the garden from Kissena Corridor Park to the east. = Administration building = The Visitor & Administration Building opened in 2007. The building is a two-story, structure that contains administrative offices and an auditorium inside. The center, designed by BKSK Architects, was the first public building in New York City to achieve the \\"Platinum\\" LEED rating, the highest energy-efficiency rating possible. It contained features such as geothermal heating, urinals that do not use water, and composting toilets. The Visitor and Administration Building also included a roof with three environmentally sustainable sections; one section contains solar panels; a second includes a rainwater collection system; and the last uses plants as insulation. These features were planned to reduce energy use by 40% compared to other buildings of similar size. The building was constructed by main contractor Stonewall Contracting Corporation at a cost of $12 million. = Farm & Compost Site = Children's gardenThe Farm & Compost Site, respectively located at the southwestern and northwestern corners of the garden, showcases how to make and use compost to create healthy soil. It includes a compost bin display, one-acre farm, and pollinator habitat, that demonstrate how people can divert organic waste and improve urban soils. Vegetables grown on the farm are shared with intern and volunteers, and donated to emergency food relief programs. Crops include heirloom tomatoes, beans, turnips, and a variety of kale, lettuces, peppers, and radishes. =Other attractions= Queens Botanical Garden includes the Fragrance Walk, an outdoor walkway lined with flowers that is located near the Main Street entrance. There is also a Bee Garden near the center south portion of the garden. =Kissena Creek= Kissena Creek initially ran under the present-day sites of Kissena Park, Kissena Corridor Park, and Queens Botanical Garden before meeting Flushing Creek at what is now the Fountain of Planets / Pool of Industry in Flushing Meadows. In 1934, Kissena Creek was placed in a culvert at its crossing with Main Street (then called Jagger Avenue), as part of a widening project for the street. The rest of the creek was buried underground in the mid-20th century during Queens Botanical Garden's construction. Today, the remnants of Kissena Creek flow in a sewer underneath Kissena and Kissena Corridor parks and the Queens Botanical Garden. It merges with an outflow sewer under Kissena Corridor. The sewers flow west into the Flushing Bay Combined Sewer Outfall (CSO) Retention Facility, located in Flushing Meadows underneath the Al Oerter Recreation Center across to the west of the Queens Botanical Garden. The facility can hold up to of water from overflows during storms, before pumping the water to the Tallman Island Waste Water Treatment Plant in College Point. Otherwise, the water empties into the Flushing River which flows north into Flushing Bay.  Programs and events  Queens Botanical Garden hosts four seasons of public programming, including cultural celebrations and seasonal festivals such as Harvest Fest & Pumpkin Patch, Arbor Fest, and Taiwan: A World of Orchids. Previous events in the 2000s and 2010s included tours of the administration building conducted shortly after it opened, as well as various children's events during the falls and winters. In 2014 and 2015, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1964 World's Fair, a model-train show was hosted at the Queens Botanical Garden. Queens Botanical Garden's educational workshops and tours offer education to children, adults, and teachers through gardens. The Garden also hosts wedding ceremonies, receptions, and other private and corporate events. The Queens Botanical Garden has a Victorian-style Wedding Garden designed specifically for weddings. However, registration is required to use the wedding garden and education building.  Funding  The Queens Botanical Garden receives funding from several sources. In 2016, it received $4.076 million in revenue before expenses. Of this, more than half came from governmental sources, such as the city and state governments. The rest was raised through fundraising events, memberships, and donations. The largest non-governmental donation was from HSBC Bank, which sponsored the Children's Garden. During the 1970s and 1980s, the city provided funding for about half of the garden's budget, and paid for all of the gardeners and maintenance workers. However, the city's allocation to Queens Botanical Garden decreased in the wake of the late-1970s New York City fiscal crisis, and funding was only restored in 1980 after significant outcry. In 2005, Queens Botanical Garden was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation. This, in turn, was made possible through a donation by then-New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Transportation Q44 SBS bus stopped in front of the Queens Botanical Garden Several bus routes of MTA Regional Bus Operations operate in the vicinity of Queens Botanical Garden. The bus route operates at the far west end of the park on College Point Boulevard, between Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park to the west and the Queens Botanical Garden to the east. The route then crosses Flushing Meadows via the Long Island Expressway. The Q20A/B and Q44 Select Bus Service routes run on Main Street at west end of the park, serving the Queens Botanical Garden.

The municipality of Ramon has a semi-radial but more defined linear development along the national road from Santiago City in the south to San Mateo towards the north. With the completion of the Magat River Multi-purpose high dam at Barangay General Aguinaldo, near the Isabela- Ifugao provincial boundary, trend of expansion has deviated westward. History In the middle of nowhere (1925-2016) when the San Jose‚ÄìSanta Fe national road opened, Ilocano migrants from the Central Plain of Luzon like Tarlac, Pangasinan, and Nueva Ecija, arrived in bull carts to settle on this vast area covered with weeds called ‚Äúsamon‚Äù as homesteaders. As required by statutes, these people stayed right on their farms to clear the lot in order call it their own. The place was a part of Buenavista, the oldest barrio of Santiago, Isabela. For more than ten long years amidst hardships and sufferings due to malaria disease and unfavorable weather conditions, the pioneers labored to convert their homestead into a productive farm with palay as their main crop. At the latter part of the thirties (1937), the Santiago‚ÄìSanta Maria road via Mallig Plains was opened and more immigrants came to farm in the place. This area which is away from the town proper of Santiago later emerged to become barrio Bugallon, eventually becoming the biggest barrio of Santiago. The completion of the Maris Dam at Oscariz in 1957 attracted more migrants to farm at the irrigated areas of Bugallon. Along with the Ilocano arrivals were few Tagalogs, Pangasinenses, and many others. The municipality of Ramon was created on June 18, 1961, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3320 sponsored by the then Congressman Delfin Albano of the then lone district of Isabela. On November 12, 1963, the first set of local officials were elected with Angelino F. Vizcarra as Municipal Mayor. The original seat of government was first conceived to be established 500 meters north of Barangay Burgos. However, the local officials decided to temporarily locate the site at Bugallon which eventually became the permanent site by virtue of Republic Act No. 11354, upon which a two storey Municipal Hall was built on December 8, 1968. The municipality was named in honor of Don Ramon Elento and was originally classified as a seventh class municipality at the time of its inauguration on January 1, 1964. Ramon had 12 original barangays carved out from the municipalities of San Mateo and Santiago. In 1966, another barangay was annexed from the municipality of Echague. Later, by virtue of the revised Barangay Charter or Republic Act. No. 3590, six additional barangays were created. The rural Electrification Program of ISELCO I was completed in the later part of the seventies (1976‚Äì77). And, with the completion of the Magat High Dam in 1983, more areas were converted into irrigated rice lands which attracted more and more people from all places to migrate to the municipality, including Igorots and Ifugaos from the hinterlands.

Ramon ranks among the top rice-producing towns of Isabela alongside the towns of Alicia and San Mateo. The northern border of Ramon is the Magat River that provides power to national grid though the Magat Dam. The dam is a major employer in Barangay General Aguinaldo and has the works buildings and staff compounds situated there also. An undeveloped airport is in the area next to the river. Ramon functions as a satellite town of Santiago City, a major growth center in southern Isabela. The Magat River Multi-purpose project, likewise, provides the municipality economic and social gains brought about by the influx of technological advancements like irrigation and electric power. La Salette Heritage Since 1948, Ramon was a mission of Santiago. It was 1978 that Ramon had a resident priest and it was only March 28, 1981 that then Bishop Miguel G. Purugganan, canonically erected this town into the status of a parish with Fr. Conrad Blanchet, MS as its first official parish priest. Former Bishop Sergio L. Utleg, D.D., the Ordinary of the Diocese of Ilagan (now the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Tuguegarao), offered the Parish of San Roque to remain under the \\"in perpetuum\\" care of the Missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette. The Provincial Superior, in deliberation with his Council, accepted the offer in its 94/04 decision in their meeting June 29, 2004. With this event, the Town of Ramon is now the only remaining parish entrusted to the Missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette.

It is located 60 km south of Mumbai, in Raigad District of Maharashtra state in western India. History =Portuguese colonization= Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, Viceroy of Portuguese India, established rule of the Portuguese Empire in Chaul in 1521, lasting until 1740. In 1508, the Egyptian Mamluks, allied with the Gujarat Sultanate vanquished the Portuguese in the Battle of Chaul. The first Portuguese settlement at Chaul took place in 1521 with the construction of the first fort on the south bank of the Kundalika River. In October 1531, the Portuguese erected a new square stone fortress, named Santa Maria do Castello, which contained a church and dwellings for 120 men. A town developed around the fortress, but a 1558 treaty precluded fortifying the town. The town was destroyed in a 1570-71 siege by the Nizam Shahi Sultan of Ahmadnagar, but a treaty was concluded which lifted the siege, and the town was rebuilt and surrounded by walls and bastions. A fort (Korlai fort) was built on the Morro de Chaul, a rocky promontory on the north side of the river opposite the town. The town withstood several further attacks, and its defence works were expanded in 1613. Chaul was part of Portuguese India's Northern Province, which by the mid 17th century extended for 100 km along the coast of present- day Maharashtra and Gujarat, from Chaul in the south to Daman in the north. The headquarters of the northern province was at Ba√ßaim (modern Vasai) north of Bombay. During the later 17th and early 18th centuries Portuguese India declined economically and politically, and Chaul lost its former importance. As the power of the Mughal Empire declined in the early 18th century, the Marathas expanded their control of central and western India. The Portuguese colony of Kalyan was captured by the Marathas in 1720, and in 1737 the Maratha general Angria began a concerted campaign to capture the remaining Portuguese territories. Chaul and the Morro de Chaul came under siege in March 1739, but the siege was raised in October. After the capture of Ba√ßaim in 1740, a peace treaty was concluded, and on 18 September 1740, Chaul was ceded by treaty to the Marathas. The city was subsequently abandoned and left in ruins. The village of Korlai, near the ruins of Chaul, is still home to speakers of Portuguese Creole.

The mayor named the new LGU after his first name but on official records, it was named after the patron of the new towm. There are seven towns in Isabela named after its founders but used prefix \\"San\\" (Saint) to remove the idea of being self-serving. In the old days, the present site of San Agustin, Isabela was a hinterland inhabited by headhunting Ilongots and some scattered bands of Aetas locally known as \\"Pogot\\". It was then a part of the municipality of Echague. From this historic town sailed forth a band of intrepid pioneers led by Juan Gumpal, Antonio Pintang, and Vicente Taguiam. They penetrated the wilderness and explored the rich valleys along both sides of the Cagayan River. They put up scattered settlements which were often plagued by malaria, and the marauding Ilongots and Pogots but the brave pioneers stayed put and in the end they were able to befriend Ilongots and Aetas and at the same time they were able to lick malaria. Not long after the scattered settlements grew into sitios and one of them was Lakay-lakay (named after the creek) on the western side of the Cagayan River. The place is now \\"Masaya Centro\\", the seat of the municipal government of San Agustin. When Jones was organized into an independent municipality in 1921, 30 barrios were separated from the municipality of Echague and one of them was Masaya. Because all the barrios of Jones prospered beyond the inhabitants' expectations and since there were no good roads connecting the barrios at that time, the people of Masaya and adjoining barrios petitioned the President of the Philippines to organize the barrios into a regular town. In 1959, the barrio of Uldogan was renamed Laoag. It is the home of the \\"Nuang Festival\\" the annual celebration in honor of the sturdy carabao and in recognition of the highly successful Carabao Upgrading Program of the local government, through the Office of the Municipal Agriculturist and its cooperating agencies and stakeholders. The program was commenced in 1993 by then Mayor Jesus M. Silorio. This was continued under the successive administrations of Mayor Virgilio A. Padilla and Mayor Operaflor A. Manuel. Under the latter's leadership, the Nuang Festival was started. Mayor Cesar Agonoy Mondala, won the 2016 Elections with the support of 1 & 1/2 barangay Captain out of 23 Barangay.

In January 1995, the Bahraini government forcibly exiled him to Dubai for leading a popular campaign demanding the reinstatement of the constitution and the restoration of parliament during the 1990s Uprising. From there he made his way to London and sought asylum. He continued opposition activities from London, where he was associated with the Bahrain Freedom Movement. Salman returned to Bahrain in March 2001 in a general amnesty as part of a set of political reforms announced by King Hamad. According to an unknown source close to his family, Sheikh Ali Salman was severely tortured by Al Khalifa regime in prisons. Numerous protests were held the detention of Sheikh Ali Salman and several people were injured after the Al Khalifa forces fired tear gas and birdshots to disperse the protesters. Within Al Wefaq he is considered a 'moderate' public face of the organization and has opposed the more confrontational approach with the authorities typical of the other leaders. Religious Beliefs Ali Salman originally studied in Qom, a major centre of Twelver Shi'a theological thinking in Iran. He is a Twelver Shiite who originally followed the quietist teachings of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Abul-Qassim al- Khoei, the spiritual leader of much of the Shia world until his death in 1992. Following death of his original Marja‚Äô, Salman has not felt compelled to speak publicly about his new Marja‚Äô. However, in a private interview he claimed that he now tended to rely on the rulings of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Husayni al-Sistani. This choice is significant as Salman does not rely on an external source of authority to justify his political positioning. This following of Sistani is on a purely individual basis that does not spill over into the public sphere; Sistani is a Marja‚Äô known for avoiding interference in the political choices of his followers. Role in 1990s Uprising in Bahrain Ali Salman is widely perceived to have been one of the leaders of the 1990s uprising in Bahrain. The starting point of the uprising is described as having been a charity marathon organised in November 1994 by several foreign companies. As the marathon runners, both men and women dressed in shorts and T-shirts, entered some Shia villages, groups of villagers headed by activist clerics tried to stop them, considering that running among them in such light clothing was a direct insult to their religious and moral values. Events disintegrated into fist-fighting and stone throwing. The same night, security forces arrested several of the protesters, including Ali Salman.Michael Sheridan \\"Violent Shia protests embarrass Bahrain Violent Shia protests embarrass Bahrain \\", The Independent, 20 December 1994 His arrest sparked a cycle of mass-demonstrations that led to the death of a dozen demonstrators and the incarceration of hundreds of others. Salman was the leader of several of these demonstrations. Following his arrest in 1994, Salman was exiled and made his way to London, where he associated with the Bahrain Freedom Movement, an opposition group led by Saeed al-Shehabi. Salman worked independently from the group but was in cooperation with them in order to achieve the political demands of the Bahrain uprising, mainly by releasing regular communiqu√©s distributed in Bahrain in which they demanded the reinstatement of the Parliament. Position in Al Wefaq Salman is the current official leader of Al Wefaq. His legitimacy as leader is derived from elections that are held every four years in Al Wefaq's General Conference where at least 50%+1 of all members in Al Wefaq elect the Secretary-General, his deputy, the members of both Al Wefaq's Shura Council and Arbitration Board. Salman faces little competition as leader of the movement and is regarded as an inspirational figure. However, the General Conference is the supreme authority in Al Wefaq and is authorized to dismiss the Secretary-General and his deputy. Al Wefaq's organisational structure includes a Shura Council which is half-elected every two years, so that half of the Council members will keep their positions for a period of four years. The Shura Council is an advisory and monitoring board to the General-Secretariat which is formed by the Secretary-General. The spiritual Godfather for the Wefaqi party is Sheikh Isa Qassim, a senior Bahraini cleric. Sheikh Issa Qassim is the most prominent cleric in Bahrain with the biggest number of followers. This can be clearly seen by comparing the number of people who pray behind him with those who pray behind other clerics. He has proved his ability to contain the anger of the masses that pray behind him and listen to his sermon every Friday. He has been able to spread self-restraint among his followers even in the peak of regime-terror and brutality during the state of emergency in 2011 following the wide Arab- Spring-inspired pro-democracy protests. However, small groups of youth do clash with the police. Pro-regime groups believe that Ali Salman, the formal head of al-Wefaq and also a cleric, is ‚Äúobeying the orders of Isa Qassim, his former teacher and superior in the clerical hierarchy‚Äù. The independence of ‚ÄòAli Salman as the formally elected leader of al-Wefaq is believed to be limited by his obligation, as a cleric who has not yet reached the level of independent reasoning (ijtihad), to submit his decisions to the sanction of a higher-ranking scholar. Because its leadership is considered subservient to an external religious authority, and therefore, they argue al-Wefaq is considered as lacking the transparency for the normal exercise of internal democracy. However, this claim fails to stand accurate in face of Al Wefaq's public and open strategy. For instance, in 2002, when the parliament was restored after about 30 years of suspension, Sheikh Issa Qassim's publicly declared advise to Al Wefaq was to participate in the elections, but Al Wefaq took a joint- decision with other opposition groups to boycott the 2002 elections in protest of the King's unkept promise to separate the three powers and transit from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. Arrest and life imprisonment Salman was arrested on 28 December 2014. Later on, he was given a life sentence in prison on 4 November 2018.

The site was renamed ‚ÄúBayumbung‚Äù as a sign of the Gaddangs' first victory in fighting for their private domains. Geography The terrain is mountainous dominated by steep hills and mountains encompassing an area of 36.44% of its total land area. Level to gently sloping is 32.03%, rolling to hilly is 8.09% while the remaining 23.44% are very steep mountains. The town was founded at the juncture of the Calocool and Magat Rivers, and has grown to incorporate the Pan-Philippine Highway. =Barangays= Bayombong is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. History St. Dominic Cathedral It was in 1739 when Spanish Augustinian Friars named the place \\"Bayumbung\\", which was later changed into Bayombong. Bayombong was formally founded on June 12, 1739 during the first Mass celebrated in the region, officiated by Father Pedro Freire in a makeshift chapel at the foot of the Bangan Hill. Bayombong came under the administration of Dominican friars as a part of the Paniqui mission pueblo a few months after its founding. The pueblo census of 1747 records 470 residents of Bayombong.Linda A. Newsom, Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines, page 226, U of Hawaii Press, 2009 The names of those considered to be founding fathers of Bayombong were Ramon Cabauatan, Jacinto Gadingan, Vicente Saquing, Ignacio Abuag, Mariano Danao, Domingo Bayaua, a certain Bincatan and a certain Mamuric. All of them were Gaddangs. Their names are remembered today in major streets of the town. In 1754, the local government was formally organized. A Capitan del Pueblo was appointed as the chief executive. In 1982, the town became the seat of the new Diocese of Bayombong. From 1773‚Äì1792, Fray Juan Crespo constructed the brick St. Dominic's church, the convent and the cemetery next to the church, and started the octagonal tower. By 1829, Fray Juan Molano finished the tower. In 1880 the church building was damaged in an earthquake, while more than a century later, in 1987, a fire destroyed the church and convent. In 1989, the 250th anniversary of the first Mass in Bayombong, the rebuilt cathedral was dedicated. On 28 Nov. 1899 during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, General Fernando Canon surrendered his 300-man battalion, plus 139 Spanish and 14 American prisoners, to 2nd Lt. James N. Munro's 53 men of the 4th Cavalry.Westfall, M., 2012, The Devil's Causeway, Guilford: Lyons Press, Included in the release were William Rynders and Orrison Woodbury, captured with the rest of Lt. Gillmore's men during the Siege of Baler. In 1916, the American administration started a farm settlement school in Bayombong. In 1918, a high-school curriculum was added, and the school was named Bayombong Rural School. In 1928, Father de Gryse started St. Mary's, a Catholic elementary school. In 1930, Bayombong Rural School was re-purposed as Nueva Vizcaya Rural High School (NVRHS), and in 1934 St. Mary's added a high-school department. During the Japanese occupation, high school operations were suspended; they resumed in 1945. In 1947, the St. Mary's College (now St. Mary's University) was established by the CICM near the elementary and high-schools of the same name. In 1956, NVRHS was converted into two programs: Nueva Vizcaya General Comprehensive High School and Nueva Vizcaya National Agricultural School. In 1964 the agricultural school became Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural College, then in 1973 Nueva Vizcaya State Institute of Technology. Presently, the school is Nueva Vizcaya State University. Bayombong is the 1913 birthplace of Roy Anthony Cutaran Bennett (1913‚Äì1990), editor of the Manila Bulletin who was tortured for his outspoken opposition to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. Edith Lopez Tiempo, another Bayombong native, was celebrated as a National Artist of the Philippines in 1999. Demographics =Language= Ilocano, Bontoc, Gaddang, Ifugao, Isinay, Tagalog, and English are used always in Bayombong's schools, markets, and places of worship but in public schools they also use Ilocano. Local government Bayombong Municipal Hall For fourteen (14) years from its founding in 1739, the town of Bayombong was administered by Friars. The major activities of the colonizers were Religion and Education. The year 1574 marked the beginning of the formal organization of the local government of Bayombong. With the appointment of a Capitan del Pueblo as the chief executive of the town. In 1789, the title of the chief executive was changed to Gobernadorcillo. In 1893, the title was changed to Capitan Municipal. During the government in 1896, the Presidente Local was chief executive of the town but this was again changed to Mayor in 1937 as per provision of the Commonwealth Constitution.

Production supply grew 37.25% since 2003, with 14,000 metric tons (MT) in 2007. The recent aquaculture congress found that the growth of tilapia production was due to government interventions: provision of fast- growing species, accreditation of private hatcheries to ensure supply of quality fingerlings, establishment of demonstration farms, providing free fingerlings to newly constructed fishponds, and the dissemination of tilapia to Nueva Vizcaya (in Diadi town). Former cycling champion Lupo Alava is a multi-awarded tilapia raiser in Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. Chairman Thompson Lantion of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, a retired two-star police general, has fishponds in La Torre, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. Also, Nueva Vizcaya Gov.

Barangays Dupax del Sur is politically subdivided into 19 barangays. * Abaca * Bagumbayan * Balzain * Banila * Biruk * Canabay * Carolotan * Domang * Dopaj * Gabut * Ganao (Lingad) * Kimbutan * Kinabuan * Lukidnon * Mangayang * Palabotan * Sanguit * Santa Maria * Talbek History The name \\"Dupax\\" comes from the Isinai word \\"dopaj\\". By \\"dopaj\\" the Isinais, who are the first inhabitants of Dupax, meant \\"to lie down in complete relaxation.\\" According to folklores that have survived from generation to generation, even long before the founding fathers established the municipality, the site of what eventually became the \\"poblacion\\", or town proper of Dupax, used to serve as a roaring camp for primitive hunters from surrounding tribal settlements. After hard days of hunting in nearby mountains, the hunters would repair the camp where they would feast on their catch of wild animals. When they were through with their brand of merrymaking \\"they would lie down and relax completely\\" before getting up again to return to their respective home. The camping area, which was a plain or a valley, was near their hunting grounds that later, they decided to settle on it together with their families and the town of Dopaj was established. In time, the town's name metamorphosed into Dupax, after the arrival of the Spaniards who, for convenience, substituted the letter \\"x\\" in lieu of letter \\"j\\" for easy pronunciation. The original town of Dupax is the largest municipality of the province of Nueva Vizcaya in terms of land area. But in 1971, the Congress passed into law Republic Act 6372 otherwise known as \\"An Act Creating the Municipality of Dupax del Sur from the Municipality of Dupax in the province of Nueva Vizcaya\\", sponsored by Congressman Benjamin B. Perez in the Philippine House of Representatives and Senator Leonardo B. Perez in the Philippine Senate. President Ferdinand Marcos amended some sections and signed it into law with the promulgation of Presidential Decree 586 on November 26, 1974 which paved the way for the division of Dupax into two municipalities: Dupax del Norte and Dupax del Sur. Important Cultural Property The town hosts the San Vicente Ferrer Church (Dupax del Sur), which is also known as the Dupax Church or Dopaj Church. The heritage structure is an 18th-century Baroque church located at Barangay Dopaj. The parish church, under the advocation of Saint Vincent Ferrer, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayombong. The church complex has been declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines in July 2001. Its construction was finished in 1776, making it older than other heritage structures in the entire country. An earlier church structure of modest design might have been erected before 1773 and records tell that the structure may have been reused as a schoolhouse after the erection of the present church at around 1773 by Father Manuel Corripio, OP. By this time, the church of Tuguegarao by Father Antonio Lobato, OP was already standing. Like the earlier Tuguegarao church, Father Corripio had the church of Dupax made of bricks and even had two kilns made near the church complex, one for firing bricks and the other for preparing lime. The current fa√ßade, which mimics the silhouette of the earlier Tuguegarao Cathedral and is reflected on the churches of Bayombong and Bambang in Nueva Vizcaya, dates back to 1776 while each level of the bell tower bears inscription of the years when which it must have been completed. Its original titular patron is the Nuestra Se√±ora del Socorro but was replaced by San Vicente Ferrer soon after the mission was returned to the Dominicans. The fa√ßade is divided by cornices into horizontal segments of plastered brick. The first level features a semicircular arched main portal embellished with clay insets. The main doorway is flanked on both sides by two blind windows with an embossed image of the Holy Eucharist. The second story features a niche and two windows framed by embossed carvings. The triangular pediment is divided into two horizontal sections with the lower half pierced with a deeply recessed oculus and the upper part featuring a relief of a cross. The entire pediment is capped by undulating cornices and seven finials, with the central finial crowned with a cross. To the left of the fa√ßade is the four-level, unplastered, rectangular bell tower. The base features saint‚Äôs niches similar to that found on the second level of the fa√ßade while the second level features long, narrow windows framed with bracket columns. The tower is capped with a decorative parapet and a small cupola surmounted by a cross. The church plaza is enclosed by a low perimeter wall and a replica of an earlier atrial cross. Two focal points inside the church are the pillars supporting the choir loft. The two, white-washed pillars are embellished with reliefs of cherubs, shells, florals and arabesques. Similar motifs can also be found on the baptistery. The original main altarpiece and pulpit are still intact but the heads of the images in the altarpiece are believed to be replicas of the ivory ones stolen over the course of the church‚Äôs history. The Dupax del Sur church is an officially declared National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines. In 2015, the Dampol Bridge was also declared as aNational Cultural Treasure, where both heritage sites were collectively named by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as the San Vicente Ferrer Church Complex and Dampol Bridge of Dupax Del Sur. The declaration remains as the only National Cultural Treasure declaration in the entire Nueva Viscaya province. Due to the outstanding cultural value of the town of Dupax del Sur, many scholars have been pushing for its inclusion in the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines.

According to the 2016 Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index conducted by the National Competitiveness Council, Solano took the 25th spot overall and ranked 30 among the first class and second class municipalities in the Philippines. This further solidified the status of Solano as the undisputed premier town of Cagayan Valley. Solano, being the largest town in Nueva Vizcaya and the fastest-growing municipality in the region, is slated to become Cagayan Valley Region's 5th City after Tuguegarao, Santiago, Cauayan, and Ilagan.

The municipality was founded in 1767 by Father Alejandro Vidal, a Dominican priest who led a Spanish mission. In 1768, it was called Lungabang, from the Gaddang word for \\"cave\\". The name was later changed to Lumabang by the Spaniards for convenience. In 1851, Governor General Antonio Urbiztondo declared Lumabang a barrio of Bayombong for not having sufficient inhabitants and revenue to maintain itself. Governor General Ramon Solano y Llanderal authorized the separation of Lumabang as barrio from Bayombong. In 1853, the first Ilocanos arrived, brought by Don Diego Lumicao, a former gobernadorcillo. In 1889, it was renamed Solano, in honor of Governor General Ramon Solano y Llanderal. The town was planned by Father Juan Villaverde, and the poblacion, as designed, consisted of 14 parallel wide streets, each having a width of 20 meters. Streets run from north to south and east to west, forming 100 square blocks with an aggregate area of one hectare per block. Solano was the largest municipality in the province until two of its barangays, Caliat and Bintawan, were segregated to become the municipalities of Quezon and Villaverde respectively. The land area of Solano was correspondingly reduced to 13,980 hectares. In 1957, the barrios of Ibung and Bintawan were separated to form the town of Ibung, later renamed as Villaverde. Demographics Local government Solano Municipal Hall = Spanish-era heads of government = Under the Spanish regime, Solano (then Bintauan) was ruled by a gobernadorcillo, which was elected by the cabezas de barangay (barangay heads) which represented the survival of the earlier tribal organizations and were responsible for the tributes of their groups. The cabezas were originally hereditary, but, in time, it became elective. The electors of the gobernadorcillo were current or former heads of the barangay and after 3 years of service became eligible for the office. The following list shows the gobernadorcillos, who had the honorary title \\"Don\\", during the Spanish regime from 1762-1898.Journals of Northern Luzon, St. Mary's University, Bayombong, 1972, pages 97‚Äì105 The following served as capit√°n del pueblo: The next three years, the town head was to be known gobernadorcillo, and the position of capitan del pueblo was abolished. * 1779 Antonio Dayag * 1780 Vicente Labog * 1781 Francisco Busa The following served as alcaldes de naturales: * 1782 Manuel Balassu * 1783 Pedro Arasa * 1784 Tomas Abbacan * 1785 Clemente Malenab * 1786 Tomas Lauagan * 1787 Domingo Dumelod * 1788 Santiago Agguid On April 19, 1789, the alcalde mayor [of Cagayan] conveyed to the people the decree issued by the King of Spain ordering the restoration of the title gobernadorcillo. By executive order of 1851, Governor-General Antonio Urbiztondo, Marques de la Solana, declared Lumabang as a barrio of Bayombong, resulting in the office of gobernadorcillo becoming teniente del barrio. It was during this time when a new province, Isabela, was created, carving a portion of Nueva Vizcaya and a part of Cagayan. The new province was named in honor of Queen Isabella of Spain. The Governor of Nueva Vizcaya was Julian del Valle. The alcalde mayor of Cagayan came here for the purpose of this reorganization. * 1857 Venido Loggan * 1858 Domingo Esguerra * 1859 Miguel Dumelod * 1860 Miguel Loggan General Ramon Solano y Llanderal authorized the separation of Lumabang as a barrio from Bayombong restoring the title of gobernadorcillo to Solano.

A seasonally ice-bound species, it is found in the Arctic and Subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean, notably in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. It is distinguished by its striking coloration, with two wide white strips and two white circles against dark brown or black fur. It is the only living species in the genus Histriophoca, although a possible fossil species, H. alekseevi, has been described from the Miocene of Moldova. Description Ribbon seal pup on the ice Adult seals are recognizable by their black skin, which carries four white markings: a strip around the neck, one around the tail and a circular marking on each body side,Saundry, Peter (2010). Ribbon seal. Encyclopedia of Earth. C.Michael Hogan (Topic Editor). Cutler J. Cleveland, ed. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC which encloses the front fins. The contrast is particularly strong with the males, while with females the difference in color between bright and dark portions is often less conspicuous. Newborn ribbon seal pups have white natal fur. After moulting their natal fur, their color changes to blue-grey on their backs and silvery beneath. Over the course of three years, portions of the fur become darker and others brighter after every molt, and only at the age of four years does the striped pattern emerge. The ribbon seal has a short snout with broad, deep internal nares and large, rounded, front-facing orbits. Like other phocids it possess enlarged auditory bullae and lacks a sagittal crest. The ribbon seal has curved, widely spaced dentition and smaller canines than other species of phocid. The ribbon seal has a large inflatable air sac that is connected to the trachea and extends on the right side over the ribs. It is larger in males than in females, and it is thought that it is used to produce underwater vocalizations, perhaps for attracting a mate. Unlike other pinnipeds, the ribbon seal lack lobes in its lungs that divide the lungs into smaller compartments. The ribbon seal can grow about long, weighing in both sexes. The main predators of ribbon seals include Great white sharks and Killer whales. =Sexual dimorphism= Male ribbon seals are typically larger than females. This is particularly recognizable in their skull morphology because male nares openings are much larger than female nares openings. Larger males are hypothesized to have a better chance of reproducing with multiple females. They have a higher fitness level and win in competition with other males over females.  Habitat  The ribbon seal lives in the Arctic parts of the Pacific Ocean. During winter and spring, it hauls out on pack ice to breed, molt, and give birth. During this time, it is found at the ice front in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas.SCS: Ribbon Seal (Phoca fasciata). pinnipeds.org During the summer and autumn, the ribbon seal lives in open water, though some move north as the ice recedes with warmer temperatures. Little is known about its habit during this time, as it is so far from land and human observation. The ribbon seal almost never comes to land. Thus far, there have been three acknowledged instances where ribbon seals have been found as far south as Squamish, British Columbia, Long Beach, Washington and even further south at Morro Bay, California. There was nothing to suggest that illness was the cause of the seals appearance, as they appeared to be healthy.Rare sea creature appears on Seattle woman's dock. LiveScience via Yahoo News (January 21, 2012)  Behavior  Ribbon seals are rarely seen out on the ice and snow. Their method of movement on the ice is unusual and highly specialized. While quickly undulating their body in serpentine motion, they grip into the ice with their claws and use alternating flipper strokes to pull themselves across the ice's surface. It has been observed that this form of locomotion is rendered ineffective on other surfaces, most likely due to the increased friction between the animal's fur and the substrate. While out on the ice, ribbon seals are noticeably indifferent to their surroundings. Humans in boats have been able to closely approach these seals before disturbing them. Mothers have been observed leaving pups by themselves for extended lengths of time. This would suggest that they experience little predation from land predators such as bears or humans, relative to other seals. When these seals are captured in nets, they are known to engage in feigning death behavior.Ribbon seal Diet The diet of ribbon seal consists almost exclusively of pelagic creatures: fish like pollocks, eelpouts, the Arctic cod and cephalopods such as squid and octopus; young seals eat crustaceans as well. The ribbon seal dives to depths of up to 200 m in search of food; it is solitary and forms no herds. Ribbon seals located in the Bering Sea consume pollock, eelpout, and arctic cod. Adult seals have relatively weak and smooth canines because their food does not need to be viciously torn.  Reproduction  Ribbon seals have a polygynous mating system, where males mate with multiple females. Ribbon seals mate and give birth on pack ice rookeries, sea ice that is not connected to land. Males use vocalizations to defend breeding territories or to attract mates. Males become sexually mature at three to six years old, females become sexually mature between two and five years old. Breeding occurs once annually, and takes place usually in late May to June, corresponding to the loss of sea ice in spring. After mating, the embryo does not implant directly after fertilization, instead it has delayed implantation for approximately two to four months. Delayed implantation allows the female to give birth when sea ice extent is greatest. Pregnant females have a gestation of approximately ten to eleven months, and give birth to one pup. Females care for their pup on pack ice for approximately four to six weeks. The milk females provide their pup is high in proteins and lipids, which allows the pup to grow very quickly. While lactating, a female ribbon seal will not forage for food, but must rely on fat stores in her body. After weaning the pup the female will teach the pup how to dive to forage for prey. Seal pups are born with a white lanugo (fur coat) that is shed about a month after birth. These pups do not enter the water until their lanugo is completely gone because their layer of blubber, and protection from cold ocean temperatures, remains undeveloped until shedding. Young ribbon seals were over hunted because of their soft and dense fur coat, which caused the population to decline.  Protection  Young ribbon seals look like young harp seals, and like these, they were hunted for their fur. Since they do not form herds, ribbon seals were more difficult to catch than harp seals. Since the Soviet Union limited the hunt on ribbon seals in 1969, their population has recovered. The current population is around 250,000. right In March 2008 the US government agreed to study Alaska's ribbon seal population and considered adding it to the endangered species list. However, in December 2008, the US government decided that sea ice critical to the seals' survival will not be endangered by global warming, and declined to list the species.Govt: Ribbon seals not endangered. Associated Press. 23 December 2008Boveng, P.L. et al. (2008). Status Review of the Ribbon Seal (Histriophoca fasciata). Seattle, WA: U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Fisheries Science Center. Instead, it became a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. The US Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), has some concerns regarding status and threats of some species, for which insufficient information is available to list them under the US Endangered Species Act. In the summer of 2009 the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit to get the decision changed. On July 10, 2013, after again reviewing the status of this species, the National Marine Fisheries Service found that listing under the ESA was not warranted.

It is currently owned and maintained by the New London Maritime Society as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program.http://www.theday.com/local/20150806/new-london-maritime-society- takes-over-as-new-london-ledge-light-owner Race Rock Light was built 1871‚Äì78 and designed by Francis Hopkinson Smith (1838‚Äì1915). It is an excellent example of 19th-century engineering and design. The massive masonry foundations on the reef took seven years to complete, but the stone structure, the keeper's quarters, and the tower were built in only nine months once the foundation was secure. The lighthouse has a fourth-order Fresnel lens in a tower standing above the waterline. The United States Coast Guard automated the light in 1978. The lighthouse is believed by some to be haunted. It was featured on an episode of Ghost Hunters and seen in the show's opening credits. History Race Rock Lighthouse stands in Long Island Sound, from New London, Connecticut, at the mouth of the Race where the waters of the Sound rush both ways with great velocity and force. By 1837, eight vessels had been lost in 8 years on Race Point reef. In 1838, Congress appropriated $3,000 for a lighthouse at Race Rock but the money was never expended. In 1852, the Lighthouse Board reported: \\"Various efforts have been made, and numerous appropriations expended, in endeavoring to place an efficient and permanent mark on this point. Buoys cannot be kept on it, and spindles have hitherto only remained until the breaking up of the ice in the spring.\\" Construction of the riprap foundation began in April 1871. In all, 10,000 tons of granite were used in the foundation. The Board reported in 1872 that the building costs were so high that \\"no more than the landing and the enrockment of the foundation, and two courses of the pier\\" could be paid for. Congress appropriated a further $75,000 in 1873, and the lighthouse was completed at a total cost of $278,716. The ledge on which the lighthouse is built is under water and ¬æ mile from Race Point Reef. It was made approximately level with small broken stone and riprap. Upon this was placed a circular-stepped mass of concrete, thick, built in four concentric layers. To form the layers of concrete, cylindrical bands of half-inch iron were used. The upper surface of the concrete is above mean low water and carries a conical pier that is high, in diameter at the base, and crowned by a projecting coping in diameter. The pier is made of heavy masonry backed with concrete and contains cisterns and cellars. The pier is surmounted by a 1¬Ω story granite dwelling, and the granite light tower ascends from its front. The whole structure is surrounded and protected by riprap. The tower is square at the base and octagonal at the top; it carries a fourth-order alternating electric light, standing above sea level and above land, and visible at sea. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 as Race Rock Light Station. In June 2011, the General Services Administration made the Race Rock Light available at no cost to public organizations willing to preserve them as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program. The New London Maritime society took ownership of Race Rock and two other lighthouses that mark the approach to New London, Connecticut.

In the series, Appa is the only known living sky flat-tailed flying bison, a species of animals that can fly naturally, and is the animal spirit guide of the protagonist, Aang. Dee Bradley Baker voices Appa, along with all the other animals, in both the TV series and the film. Creation and conception The show's creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have described Appa's appearance as a cross between a buffalo and a manatee, although its body plan does resemble that of a water bear. According to an interview with the artists involved with creating the show, Appa's design was based on that of Catbus from the movie My Neighbor Totoro, as they found it difficult to create a six-legged mammal. Habits In the Avatar franchise, Appa is the last known living sky bison, which are large mammal-like creatures that fly through airbending and steer through air currents with their broad tails. The bison are covered in thick white fur with a large brown arrow marking that is remarked to be extremely itchy. In the show, the markings on the flying bison's backs are what inspired the tattoos which symbolize an Air Nomad's mastery of Airbending. Their fur is shed at the end of winter. The Air Nomads summon the sky bison to their side through the use of whistles that only the animals can hear.APPA THE FLYING BISON ‚Äì LAST AIRBENDER MOVIE. Teaser- Trailer.com Aang and friends use the words \\"yip yip\\" to get Appa to take off into the air. Like all animals in the Avatar series, Appa cannot speak. =Personality= Throughout the series, Appa has demonstrated high intelligence and often appears to understand a portion of human speech, whereas Momo, the winged lemur, struggles to understand. Although placid, Appa has shown himself capable of fighting when necessary. Other aspects of Appa's character include his fear of fire and his trusting of those who have been kind to him. He can become quite temperamental towards anyone who he thinks is a threat to himself or his friends, especially Aang. Conversely, he has demonstrated an unrestrained affection towards those that he likes. Appa also has a fear of going underground or in small tunnels, evidenced by his claustrophobic panic in the episode \\"The Cave of Two Lovers\\". He has a special friendship with Momo the lemur, with whom he is often in company. Appa also shows a special preference towards Zuko, who saved him from his imprisonment beneath Lake Laogai. Appearances Dee Bradley Baker is the voice behind Appa for both the animated series and the film. Appa is featured prominently throughout the franchise, not only in the Avatar: The Last Airbender TV series, but also in the film The Last Airbender, various video games, and comic books. Dee Bradley Baker voices Appa in both the TV series and the film. =In the animated series= Appa is in almost every episode of the animated series, having appeared in 58 of the 61 episodes of the three seasons.Filmography by TV series for Appa (Character) from \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\" (2005) Much of the back-story about the character comes from the episode Appa's Lost Days, \\"in which the most under-explored member of the team gets his very own episode.\\"Whitehead, Adam. Avatar: The Last Airbender - Book II: Earth. The Wertzone: SF&F; In Print & On Screen. June 4, 2008. The first meeting between Aang and Appa is seen during a flashback sequence in Appa's Lost Days. It is tradition with Air Nomads that each young Airbender is given a sky bison calf once they come of age to be the Airbender's lifelong animal companion. In a flashback on Appa's Lost Days, Appa's herd flies down to an Air Nomad Temple where Aang and other young Airbenders are waiting. Aang brings Appa an apple as a sign of friendship, which Appa accepts, sealing their bond as well as giving Appa his name, after the word \\"apple\\". Almost immediately, the two became friends and would remain close, Appa being the one thing aside from his staff and robes from Aang's home that Aang took with him when he fled the Southern Air Temple. Appa remained in suspended animation along with Aang for 100 years until their discovery by Katara and Sokka. Since then, Appa has been the group's main form of transportation in their quest, as well as occasionally assisting in battle. Appa was a consistent part of the group throughout the series until his capture by the Sandbenders in \\"The Library\\". Appa became lost for a short time when the group was traveling in the Earth Kingdom. He was kidnapped by Sandbenders in the middle of the vast Si Wong desert, while Aang, Katara, Sokka, and their winged lemur Momo were trapped in a vast underground library. It is later revealed that he was eventually sold to a Fire Nation circus where an animal tamer attempted to make him part of the show. Appa later escaped and journeyed throughout the Earth Kingdom until he encountered the Kyoshi Island Warriors, who attempted to heal the various wounds he had sustained in his travels and escort him back to Aang. Appa was forced to leave after an attack by Azula and her allies, ushered away by Suki while the warriors tried to delay the three Fire Nation girls. On his journey he encountered a sadhu named Guru Pathik at the Eastern Air Temple, to which he had fled. Being healed of his personal turmoil and directed to Aang by the sadhu, Appa flew to Ba Sing Se, where he was captured by Long Feng. Appa was kept in a secret location at Lake Laogai until his rescue by Zuko, who was initially planning on utilizing him to capture the Avatar. Appa eventually returns to the main group in the last scenes of Lake Laogai. Appa still accompanies Aang and his group even after they enter the Fire Nation. However, in order to make sure that he does not give away Aang's identity when flying, Aang covers Appa with clouds as a disguise while in flight. At the Western Air Temple, he was among the first members of the group to accept Zuko as Aang's firebending teacher, as he is still grateful for Zuko freeing him in Ba Sing Se. He flew Aang and Zuko to the Sun Warrior Temple in order to learn the origin of firebending. He also flew Zuko and Katara to the Southern Raiders ship, so Katara could confront the murderer of her mother. After the search for Aang in the finale failed, the group was forced to divide their efforts to prevent the Fire Nation from wiping out the Earth Kingdom. Appa flew Zuko and Katara to the Fire Nation capital where they fought and defeated Azula before she could assume leadership of the throne. Afterward, Appa is last seen outside of Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se, listening to Iroh play a horn. =In the film= Appa as he appears in the live action movie The Last Airbender.

The film trailer shown during the Super Bowl led UGO Entertainment critic Jordan Hoffman to ask, \\"Where's Appa?\\" as the sole complaint, noting the character's lack of prominence in the preview. Correspondingly, MTV's Rick Marshall provided instructions online on \\"how to find the elusive Appa\\" for the character's brief appearance in the background of a trailer scene.Marshall, Rick. \\"See M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Last Airbender' Super Bowl Trailer In High-Def...

The film is based on Vito Russo's 1981 book The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies, and on lecture and film clip presentations he gave in 1972‚Äì1982. Russo had researched the history of how motion pictures, especially Hollywood films, had portrayed gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender characters. The film was given a limited release in select theatres, including the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, in April 1996, and then shown on cable channel HBO as part of its series America Undercover. Overview The documentary interviews various men and women connected to the Hollywood industry to comment on various film clips and their own personal experiences with the treatment of LGBT characters in film. From the sissy characters, to the censorship of the Hollywood Production Code, the coded gay characters and cruel stereotypes to the changes made in the early 1990s. Vito Russo wanted his book to be transformed into a documentary film and helped out on the project until he died in 1990. Some critics of the documentary noted that it was less political than the book and ended on a more positive note. However, Russo had wanted the documentary to be entertaining and to reflect the positive changes that had occurred up to 1990. Production Russo approached Epstein about making a film version of The Celluloid Closet and even wrote a proposal for the film version in 1986. But it was not until Russo died in 1990 that Epstein and Friedman gained any traction on the project. After his death, Channel 4 in England approached the filmmakers about the film, and offered development funding in order to write a treatment, ‚Äúand most importantly to determine if it would even be possible to obtain the film clips from studios.‚Äù After developing the project for years, fundraising remained the biggest obstacle. Lily Tomlin, the actress and comedian who would narrate the film, launched a direct mail fundraising campaign in Vito Russo's honor. She also headlined a benefit at the Castro Theatre, which featured Robin Williams, Harvey Fierstein, and drag star Lypsinka. Individuals such as Hollywood producer Steve Tisch, James Hormel, and Hugh Hefner offered ‚Äúsignificant support‚Äù and the filmmakers also began to receive foundation funding from the Paul Robeson Fund, the California Council for the Humanities, and the Chicago Resource Center. European television again played an important role in funding the project, when ZDF/arte signed on, but it was not until the filmmakers reached out to HBO that they were able to begin production. In May 1994, ‚ÄúLily Tomlin contacted Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO, on behalf of the project. Epstein, Friedman, Tomlin, and Rosenman flew to New York for a meeting with Fuchs and HBO Vice President Sheila Nevins. At that meeting, HBO committed to supply the remainder of the budget.‚Äù Credits The following people are interviewed for the documentary. * Lily Tomlin (narrator) * Jay Presson Allen * Susie Bright * Quentin Crisp * Tony Curtis * Richard Dyer * Arthur Laurents * Armistead Maupin * Whoopi Goldberg * Jan Oxenberg * Harvey Fierstein * Gore Vidal * Farley Granger * Paul Rudnick * Shirley MacLaine * Barry Sandler * Mart Crowley * Antonio Fargas * Tom Hanks * Ron Nyswaner * Daniel Melnick * Harry Hamlin * John Schlesinger * Susan Sarandon * Stewart Stern DVD In 2001, the DVD edition of the documentary includes a crew audio commentary, a second audio commentary with the late Russo, an interview Russo gave in 1990, and some deleted interviews put together into a second documentary titled Rescued from the Closet. Impact The Celluloid Closet had precursors in Parker Tyler's 1972 book Screening the Sexes and Richard Dyer's 1977 Gays and Film. The film was released at a dramatic time in gay history, as Bill Clinton was elected president as the first major party presidential candidate to court and to promise openly to gay voters. However, the movement faced a huge public setback when \\"Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell\\" was passed. In response to these obstacles, the LGBT-rights movement became increasingly media focused, realizing that the images projected into the world negatively affected perceptions of homosexuality. In 1994, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation was formed as a national organization. The Celluloid Closet came out in 1996, as marches and protests against homosexual representation in film and television grew. \\"Protests [were] aimed specifically at some of Hollywood's biggest and most prestigious films, including The Silence of the Lambs, which features a crazed transvestite who kills and flays women, and JFK, which has a scene in which gays alleged to be conspirators in the Kennedy assassination cavort in sadomasochistic fun and games\\". The article quoted above features an interview with Kate Sorensen, a member of Queer Nation, an organization that helped to organize the protests: \\"‚ÄòEvery lesbian and bisexual character in these films is accused of being a psychotic killer ... And the girl never gets the girl. I'm tired of that.‚Äô‚Äù Gay activists across the country attacked films like these, where the homosexual character is portrayed as a disgustingly erotic killer. It was believed that these portrayals reflected \\"a perverse fear of AIDS or the rising intolerance that [had] caused an increase in hate crimes of all kinds. Still, Hollywood's treatment of gays [hadn‚Äôt] helped. With few exceptions, the homosexual characters in films are creepy misfits or campy caricatures\\". The release of The Celluloid Closet further emphasized the twisted way homosexuals have been depicted throughout history. Addressing specific issues that were pertinent at the time, Russo exposes the existence of Hollywood homosexuals as well as the uncontrolled homophobia that keeps homosexuality in the closet on and off the screen. \\"Russo essentially did for film what ACT UP did for AIDS awareness ... he opened up a world and a culture that had almost never been discussed before under any circumstances, exposing prejudices and hurts‚Äù. The film continued to motivate the need for positive representation of homosexuals. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation held seminars for staff at Columbia Pictures and Carolco. In addition, Hollywood Supports, a service organization with the mission to combat AIDS phobia and homophobia in the entertainment industry, was founded. Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) gives an award called the Vito Russo Award to openly gay or lesbian people within the Hollywood film industry who advance the cause of fighting homophobia. In addition the film was honored with four Emmy Award nominations in 1996. It was nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Informational Programming for editing, sound recording and director of photography. It was also nominated for Outstanding Informational special. Additionally, the film received both a Peabody Award and recognition at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival by winning the Freedom of Expression award.

It has been developed by the Sable Research Group at McGill University. Soot provides four intermediate representations for use through its API for other analysis programs to access and build upon: * Baf: a near bytecode representation. * Jimple: a simplified version of Java source code that has a maximum of three components per statement. * Shimple: an SSA variation of Jimple (similar to GIMPLE). * Grimp: an aggregated version of Jimple suitable for decompilation and code inspection. The current Soot software release also contains detailed program analyses that can be used out-of-the-box, such as context-sensitive flow-insensitive points-to analysis, call graph analysis and domination analysis (answering the question \\"must event a follow event b?\\"). It also has a decompiler called dava. Soot is free software available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). In 2010, two research papers on Soot ( and ) were selected as IBM CASCON First Decade High Impact Papers among 12 other papers from the 425 entries. Jimple  Jimple is an intermediate representation of a Java program designed to be easier to optimize than Java bytecode. It is typed, has a concrete syntax and is based on three-address code. Jimple includes only 15 different operations, thus simplifying flow analysis. By contrast, java bytecode includes over 200 different operations. Unlike java bytecode, in Jimple local and stack variables are typed and Jimple is inherently type safe. Converting to Jimple, or \\"Jimplifying\\" (after \\"simplifying\\"), is conversion of bytecode to three-address code. The idea behind the conversion, first investigated by Clark Verbrugge, is to associate a variable to each position in the stack. Hence stack operations become assignments involving the stack variables. =Example= Consider the following bytecode, which is from the iload 1 // load variable x1, and push it on the stack iload 2 // load variable x2, and push it on the stack iadd // pop two values, and push their sum on the stack istore 1 // pop a value from the stack, and store it in variable x1 The above translates to the following three-address code: stack1 = x1 // iload 1 stack2 = x2 // iload 2 stack1 = stack1 + stack2 // iadd x1 = stack1 // istore 1 In general the resulting code does not have static single assignment form.

The light marks the northern limit of the Florida Reef, an underwater coral formation on the lower east coast of the state. History Hillsboro Point was designated as hazardous for the safe navigation of ships in 1855 and federal designation was sought. A request for a lighthouse at the inlet was first made in 1884. The request was repeated yearly and rejected 17 times. In 1901, the United States Lighthouse Board persuaded Congress to authorize the construction of a lighthouse in the dark area between Jupiter Inlet Light and Fowey Rocks Light. The official order approved on February 12, 1901 called for a \\"first-order light at or near Hillsboro Point...at a cost not to exceed $90,000.\\" No appropriation of funds was made in 1901 and in 1902 $45,000 was appropriated. The full funding to build the lighthouse was appropriated on March 3, 1903. Initially a site on the south side of the inlet was selected, however it was not feasible, so a site on the north of the inlet was chosen. The owner of the property did not want to sell at first but after beginning condemnation proceedings, an agreement to purchase the land was reached. The 3 acre (1.2 ha) parcel was purchased for $150 from Elnathan T. Field and Mary W. Osborn of Middleton, New Jersey who had bought the land for 70 cents an acre (0.4 ha) from the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund. Soon after the light was operational unexplained reports of fires in the Everglades began to come in. The cause was the lens, when stopped in the morning at just the right position, it would focus the sunlight west towards the wetlands. A landward baffle was installed. This also shielded nearby residents from the bright light at night. Lightkeepers would assist shipwrecks using three 12 to 20 horsepower gas boats. The wives of the lighthouse keepers would make sea grape jelly to trade for pickled vegetables from local farmers. Four Coast Guard signalmen were stationed at the lighthouse in World War I barracked in one of the storehouses. During the 1926 Miami hurricane J.B. Isler stood a 32-hour watch, keeping the light burning while fearing the lighthouse would fall. It stood but of sand was washed out from under it, according to Mary Ella Knight Voss, daughter of a prior lightkeeper. The storm also damaged the dwellings and carried away the boathouse and wharf. Isler's son George and daughter Ruth, born in the keeper's house, were the first children of record born at the Hillsboro Inlet. The lighthouse beach patrol spotted a German U-boat in 1943, during World War II. The submarine was reportedly sunk, but no wreck has been documented. Later that year a freighter, the M.S. Arcura aroused the suspicion of a lighthouse keeper. The ship was being used as a raider and was crewed by German nationals and carrying arms. The crew were transported to Port Everglades and the Arcura became a war prize. In 1974 the lighthouse was fully automated. One United States Coast Guardsman was assigned to remain on site to maintain the light and grounds. The assistant keepers' homes were converted to guest quarters for senior coast guard and other senior military officers. The Hillsboro Inlet Light Station was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1979. The lighthouse and buildings are little altered from their original construction in 1907. In the second half of the 20th century, this inlet became an increasingly busy waterway. Hillsboro Inlet Light is considered one of the most powerful lights in the world with a beam that can be seen for . The lighthouse Hillsboro Inlet Lighthouse The octagonal iron pyramidal tower was built by a Chicago steel firm for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. After the fair it purchased by the U.S. government, Russell Wheel and Foundry of Detroit, Michigan completed the metal work for the structure in 1907. It was then disassembled and moved to Hillsboro Inlet. The J.H. Gardner Construction Company of New Orleans, Louisiana cleared the land, laid the foundations and re-assembled and erected the lighthouse. The construction is held together with bolts there are no welds. Iron piping held together with 192 special cast iron joints and 80 tension rods with turnbuckles make up the structure. It is supported by eight concrete foundations in a 40-foot (12 m) circle with a ninth at the center. It is an iron skeleton framework with a central column and a watch house. The inner column has circular stairs and space for the weights that were used to rotate the lens. It stands tall. It was lit on March 7, 1907. It is one of the oldest structures in Broward County. A description published at the time read, \\"The structure is an octagonal pyramidal, iron skeleton tower with central stair cylinder; the lower third of the structure is painted white; the upper two- thirds and the lantern are painted black. There are three white one-and-one- half story light-keepers dwellings in a row, about 100 feet to the northward of the light tower and a red brick oilhouse about fifty feet to the westward of the tower. There is also a boathouse near the inlet with boatways sixty feet long.\\" The paint scheme was selected for daytime visibility, the lower portion white to stand out among trees, the top black to contrast with the daytime sky. The lighthouse has a cast iron roof with a finial. The main entrance faces north and has double doors in a vestibule. There is an iron balustrade separating the lantern from the watch room. The interior is iron with wood paneling and wood floors and ceiling in the watch room. The watch room has five two over two double hung sash windows. The light Its second- order bivalve Fresnel lens emits a light measuring 5.5 megacandelas and is placed above sea level. Although the order authorizing the lighthouse specified a first-order light, a second-order light and rotating mechanism was contracted for from Barbier, Bernarn and Turenne of Paris, France at the cost of $7,250. The lens is in diameter and weighs . It consists of 356 individual hand ground glass panels in a brass frame. The original light was an incandescent oil vapor lamp fueled with kerosene. At 370,000 candle power it could be seen from away at sea on a clear night. The light assembly rotated on a liquid mercury reservoir, allowing up to one rotation per 15 seconds. The mercury was contained in a doughnut-shaped base and required filtering every 10 years to remove salt that accumulated. Rotation was driven by a weight on ropes through a gear mechanism. The amount of weight determined the speed of rotation. The weight had to be hand cranked back up about each hour and a half. Several times a night fuel was carried by hand up the 175 steps. The kerosene lamp was replaced with four 250 watt incandescent bulbs in the 1920s. At 550,00 candlepower, it was then the most powerful lighthouse on the east coast of the United States. The electrical system was upgraded in 1932 allowing the same amount of light to be generated with three bulbs instead of four. This is about the time electric utility wires were erected in the Hillsboro area. Two 1,000 watt xenon high pressure lamps were installed in 1966, bringing the light to 5.5 megacandelas, making it the third most powerful lighthouse in the world at that time. In 1977 it was the most powerful light in Florida. In the 21st century it has been claimed that the beam from the Hillsboro Inlet Light is the most powerful in the world. Automated in 1974, the light acts both as a coastal navigational aide and as a support to local water traffic. Other buildings The G.W. Brown Construction Company of West Palm Beach, Florida was contracted in 1905 to build the support buildings on the site, for a cost \\"not to exceed $21,500\\". Three dwellings, an oilhouse, a storehouse, a wharf, outhouses, walks and fences were built. There were three lighthouse keepers who lived with their families in the three houses. The oilhouse stored barrels of kerosene as the primary fuel for the light. In 1977 the complex was made up of a lighthouse, light keeper's quarters, senior officer recreation quarters, shop and garage building, timer and generator building, and a barracks building. Four of these were in use by the coast guard to operate the station. The keeper's quarters and recreational quarters are one-story wood frame vernacular buildings on brick piers. The construction is wood and clapboard. They have gabled roofs with a cross gable. One of these three homes was demolished in 2005 with plans to rebuild it in a new location. It had been bought by the Hillsboro Club in 1936, when a third lightkeeper was no longer needed, and moved north. The building had suffered structural damage and the club planned to erect a modern building in its location. The barracks is a building on a brick foundation with an asphalt shingle roof. It was originally used as an administration building then as quarters for the crew until 1974. The garage building is . It is a wood frame single story structure with a redwood shingle roof. First used as a stable by the beach patrol it later housed a government vehicle, when assigned. Both were built in 1907. The timer and generator building was built in 1942 and is . Restoration In 1992 the big light was turned off, due to the failure of the rotating mechanism, and a smaller temporary light (a Vega 25 rotating beacon) was installed on the railing. This light was only visible for . The Coast Guard had planned to remove the original fresnel lens but a successful local campaign, including resolutions from the cities of Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach and Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, led to the restoration. The Hillsboro Lighthouse Preservation Society was founded by Harry Cushing in 1997 as a part of the campaign. About 200 people joined the preservation society at that time. The historical value of keeping the lens in the lighthouse and the importance of the bright light as an aid to navigation were cited in the effort to persuade the Coast Guard to restore the light. The cost of the restoration was $143,000. The old mechanism contained of mercury which was replaced by a specially designed ball bearing system. The mercury was removed in 1995 by Chemical Waste Management of Pompano Beach at a cost of $32,500. The lead based paint sandblasted off and epoxy paint applied by Worth Contracting of Jacksonsville, Florida the same year. The cost of this cleanup was $98,000. The large light was relit on January 28, 1999. One month after the lamp was relit the bearing system, designed by Collins Engineering of Chicago, failed. It was redesigned by the Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit, with sixty 2 inch (51 mm) balls in of oil. The redesigned mechanism was built by the Torrington Company of South Carolina and cost the Coast Guard $30,000. Once again on August 18, 2000 the light was turned on. the fresnel lens was one of nine in active use in the United States. Modern times On June 13, 2003, the Hillsboro Inlet Light was commemorated with a 37¬¢ U.S. postage stamp. An art show in 2004 at the Pompano Beach civic center featured works \\"inspired by the lighthouse, its station keeper's dwellings, monuments, beach and flora\\". The Hillsboro Lighthouse Preservation Society (the preservation society) took over maintenance from the Coast Guard in 2008. The Coast Guard considered turning the light off or obscuring a portion of it to prevent guiding hatchling sea turtles away from the ocean in 2012. Also that year a bronze statue of the Barefoot mailman, James \\"Ed\\" Hamilton, was erected at the base of the lighthouse. It replaced a concrete and marble one created in 1973. The earlier sculpture stood outside the Barefoot Mailman Restaurant until it closed, moving to in front of the Hillsboro Inlet town hall and then in 2003 to the lighthouse grounds. The new bronze cost about $30,000. Both sculptures were the work of Frank Varga. recreational quarters were still available for senior military officers. The Morale, Well-Being and Recreational Cottages facility consists of the Keeper's Quarters, Inlet House and The Bungalow. The Keeper's Quarters is a three-bedroom, two bath, two story house that can accommodate 7 occupants. The first floor is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It is described by the Coast Guard as formerly the lighthouse keeper's quarters. The Inlet House is three-bedroom, two bath, two- story house. It can also accommodate 7 and is closest to the Hillsboro Inlet Waterway. Located directly behind the Inlet House is The Bungalow a one and a half story, one and a half bath, one bedroom building that can accommodate 4. On August 9, 2014 a national historic marker commemorating the Hillsboro Inlet Light Station, commissioned by the Daughters of the American Revolution was dedicated in the Hillsboro Inlet Park across the inlet from the lighthouse. Surrounded by water on three sides and on the other by the Hillsboro Club which restricts access to its property, the lighthouse is only available to tours four times a year conducted by the preservation society via boat. In some U.S. government drug operations the lighthouse served as a vantage point. It is known locally as the \\"Big Diamond\\". Ralph Krugler the official historian of the preservation society is preparing a book on the history of the lighthouse. He intends to correct many of the inaccuracies that have been reported (he states even the list of keepers in bronze on the lighthouse isn't accurate) and relate stories uncovered in his research. The lighthouse is threatened by coastal erosion. Hurricane Irma washed a large amount of sand from under the foundations of the lighthouse and displaced the barefoot mailman statue. Half of the land the lighthouse sits on was washed away. Irma damaged the building and the site. The footings and foundation were fractured. The preservation society is raising funds for a plan to build a granite spur jetty to protect the site. Keepers The first keeper, appointed March 3, 1907, was Alfred A. Berghell. His title was Captain of the United States Lighthouse Service. Bergell's work exceeded the expectations of a keeper, he rescued many stranded seafarers and saved numerous lives. The first assistant keepers were Henry A. Keys (First Assistant) and Robert H. Thompson (Second Assistant). In 1911 Thomas Knight became lightkeeper. His four children grew up at the station and were educated at a school there. At the time there were no established roads along the beach and it was a day-long trip to reach the nearest town, Pompano Beach about away. Knight's monthly salary was $125, the First Assistant B.F. Stone was paid $115 and the Second Assistant J.B. Isler $110. A local story is that Knight would signal his brother Eugene Knight, a rum-runner when the coast was clear. *J.B. Isler (1920‚Äì39) *B.F.

It is one of the earliest arcade games powered by the Sega System 24 arcade system board. Gameplay Arcade screenshot Bonanza Bros. is a shooter platform game where players take the role of one or both of the brothers Robo (1P, red) and Mobo (2P, blue) (Mike and Spike in some PAL versions), who were modeled on The Blues Brothers. The object of the game is to travel stealthily around each building while avoiding guards, retrieve several objects within a time limit, and move to the roof where a blimp is expecting the player with the loot. In this fashion the plot and gameplay resemble the older Atari 2600 title Keystone Kapers, but with added features that are similar to the ones in Lock 'n' Chase. Two players can play cooperatively at the same time, as the screen is always split in two. The places the brothers burgle include a bank, a millionaire's mansion, a casino, a mint, an art gallery and a treasury. While similar in graphics and gameplay, the story and the Bonanza Bros.' role changes from the original Japanese to the early western versions: in the former, the duo are thieves attempting to steal valuable treasures for profit whilst avoiding getting arrested; in the latter, they are recruited by the Police Chief of Badville to test security facilities and help the police recover evidence from various crooked businesses and institutions, but on the threat of jail if they fail to do so. The player can walk, jump, shoot and move behind a column or large furniture, which allows both hiding and dodging shots from the guards, which can't be neutralized definitively, only stunned for a few seconds using the gun or pressing a door against them. They are alerted by sounds or with the Brothers entering their field of vision, and then either hide, call for help or fire against the player. Some guards have a riot shield and can only be hit when moving away. A player loses a life if hit by a guard's projectile or melee attack, attacked by a dog, or pressed by a door. Losing a life in these ways causes the player to drop all items. Running out of time both costs players a life and forces them to restart the stage. Ports The arcade game was ported to the Sega Mega Drive, Master System, TurboGrafx-CD (Japan only), ZX Spectrum (Europe only), Amstrad CPC (Europe only), Commodore 64, Amiga, Sharp X68000 (Japan only) and Atari ST, with minor graphics differences, depending on the system, and some changes in the gameplay, mainly in the bonus stages. Reception Game Machine listed Bonanza Bros. on their July 15, 1990 issue as being the third most-popular arcade game by that point. Mega Zone magazine enjoyed Bonanza Bros. for its usage of digitized speech and stating ‚ÄúThe Best thing about this game though is it‚Äôs witty. The whole idea is clever and the way the characters act is like an old Laurel and Hardy or Keystone cops movie.‚Äù Sinclair User recommended the game to those who like the use of planning and timing rather then sheer speed of reaction. Computer and Video Games praised the game‚Äôs originality, graphics and stating ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very different sort of game that taxes your brains rather then your reflexes‚Äù Legacy It was included in the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection (it was removed in the Western release). It has also seen a Sega Ages release on the PlayStation 2, and that version was included in the English compilation Sega Classics Collection. The game appeared as part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The game next appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Then the game is also playable in Sega Genesis Classics for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and for PC There are also 3 spin-offs to the game. The first is called \\"Puzzle & Action: Tant-R\\" which was released in the year 1992, the second called \\"Puzzle & Action: Ichidant-R\\", which was released in the year 1994. These two arcade games were ported to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn, and later packaged with the Sega Ages release of Bonanza Bros. on the PlayStation 2. They are considered spin-offs as they do not follow the action genre of the original game, as they are instead puzzle games. A third arcade game \\"Puzzle & Action: Treasure Hunt\\" was released in 1995 by Sega and ported to the Sega Saturn in Japan by CRI. Bonanza Bros. was also included in Sonic Gems Collection but only for the Japanese Market. It was removed from the US and PAL releases along with the Streets of Rage series in order to preserve its universal rating. However, Bonanza Bros. made its first appearance on the recent Sega Genesis Collection for the PS2 in North America as the PS2 version of Sonic Gems Collection remains in Japan and Europe. On January 29, 2007, the Mega Drive/Genesis version of Bonanza Bros. became available for download on the Wii Virtual Console in America. It was later released in Europe on February 2, 2007. It was also released for cell phones using SoftBank Mobile. Robo and Mobo later appeared as playable characters in Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and made a cameo in the \\"Race of AGES\\" track in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. A \\"Bonanza Bros.\\" slot machine has been released by Aristocrat Leisure.

Zhang converted to Christianity at the age of thirty seven and became a member of the Presbyterian church for seven years and was then appointed as a Deacon for three years. In 1909 after hearing a testimony from a church Elder, Ling-sheng went to the Shanghai Apostolic Faith Mission to study. Zhang returned home on 21 December of that same year and entered a church hall one morning in order to pray alone. It was at this time he began experiencing glossolalia, claiming to have been inspired by the Holy Spirit. The following year after closely studying the Seventh-day Adventist doctrines, he subsequently changed his Sabbath services to Saturdays instead of Sunday. During 1913 and 1914 Ling-Sheng began forming the \\"True Jesus Church\\" and held services at his home with friends and relatives. In 1917 Ling-Sheng went to the Church of God in Beijing and there he met an American missionary named Berntsen who also kept the Sabbath on Saturdays and whom preached on issues concerning the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Ling-sheng then accepted the laying on of hands by Berntsen and two other Elders and as a result was ordained as a Deacon. In the Spring of 1918, Ling-sheng started preaching the gospel of the True Jesus Church in co-operation with Paul Wei, another co-worker. Most of their labour was concentrated in the Northern regions of China. Ling-Sheng later returned to his hometown of Shandong and settled down and became the pastor of the local church. See also * Protestant missions in China * Barnabas Zhang Notes  #The Apostolic Faith Mission's three basic faiths were: ##Receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit through speaking in tongues, ##belief in the One True God instead of Trinity and ##performing baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus (instead of the Father and the Holy Spirit). ##Berntsen 's Apostolic Faith church also performed feet washing. However his church later changed to the Church of God and later switched again to the Assembly of God.

Remington. He and older brother Nathaniel trained as clockmakers but both ran away from home and travelled for over two years in Wales and the west of England with a troupe of Gypsies. About 1781 they settled in London where Andrew took up work as a manservant to Richard Cosway, who later trained him in portrait painting. Plimer specialised in portrait miniatures. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1768 to 1810 and in 1819. His most famous painting is of the three daughters of Sir John Rushout. His brother Nathaniel Plimer also became a pupil of Cosway and a painter of miniatures. Plimer married on 21 February 1801, Joanna Louisa, daughter of John and Frances Knight of Wicken, Northamptonshire. The couple had one son who died in infancy and four daughters. He died in Western Cottages, Western Road, Brighton, Sussex, in January 1837 aged 73 and was buried on 4 February at Old Hove.

In 1936, the San Dieguito Union High School District was created and San Dieguito High School in Encinitas opened to serve students living in Del Mar, Solana Beach, Rancho Santa Fe, and Encinitas. It remained the only high school in the district until Torrey Pines High School opened in 1974. Based on population growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and projections, a second high school was needed. At the time, San Dieguito High School and Earl Warren Middle School were forced to do double sessions to deal with the shortage of space. Earl Warren at the time also had the ninth grade freshman class attending its school. In the early 1970s after two defeats, a bond issue placed on the ballot finally passed. A location was chosen at what seemed out-of-the-way at the time; however, the location was based on the projected growth of what was then known as ‚ÄúNorth City West‚Äù ‚Äì commonly known today as Carmel Valley. Torrey Pines High School opened in the fall of 1974. The architecture reflects the era with stained/painted wood and the avocado greens, yellow, and orange decor popular in the era 1970s. When it initially opened, access to the school came from the original alignment of the two-lanes only Black Mountain Rd., but the access road was later modified when Del Mar Heights Rd. was extended east. The architecture of the school was considered modern at the time. Design features included an open courtyard and wide hallways with large carpeted podium-like benches one could sit on. The classrooms had no windows, and many did not have doors. It also had its own Black Box Theater. The large library (the Media Center) was considered state-of-the-art at the time. In 2016, construction began on the Media Center to build a new exterior and entrance. Construction was completed December 2016. There were many logistical problems in its initial opening, including an immediate shortage of classrooms and lockers, and lack of a food service building and a football stadium. As a result, portable classrooms and a bank of vending machines were used. Football games were played at San Dieguito High School. The school rid of all lockers in the 1990s. In the 1980s, the school expanded. Various changes include the Media Center building's expansion towards Del Mar Heights Rd., the addition of a parking/transportation area, the repurposing of portable classrooms into athletics and weight rooms, the addition of a football stadium, and the conversion of the original black box theater into a lecture hall (with a second black box theater, a converted machine shop, later added in the Arts building). In 2003, Building E and G were built. Stairs were added to the main building. In the summer of 2008, more stairs were constructed leading from the parking lot nearest Del Mar Heights Road to the English building. In November 2012, Prop AA, a $449 million bond initiative aimed at improving the public school district, was passed by tax payers. Since then, ongoing construction is taking place to include a performing arts center (the PAC), culinary arts center, revamping the student/front entry way, building more science and technology based classrooms, building a weight room, and moving classrooms in temporary buildings into permanent structures. Torrey Pine's chief rival is Canyon Crest Academy, located about three miles (5 km) to the east. Demographics Torrey Pines High School has a primarily Caucasian and Asian student body. Students from the districts of Del Mar, Solana Beach and Rancho Santa Fe school districts, with the exception of the area north of Escondido Creek in the Rancho Santa Fe School are eligible to attend. The student body is largely reflective of the surrounding area of Torrey Pines, characterized mainly by a level of affluence. Most adults in the area are highly educated, and a strong majority have a bachelor's and master's degree. The median household income is over $100,000 In the 2013‚Äì14 school year, there were 2,740 students (60% White, 27% Asian, 11% Hispanic, 1% Black, <2% Other) attending Torrey Pines High School. 48% of the population was female. Extracurricular activities =Academic teams= Torrey Pines High School's academic teams include Speech and Debate, Academic Team, Quizbowl, FRC robotics, and Science Olympiad. In the 2009‚Äì10 school year, Torrey Pines High School placed 7th at the Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence National Quizbowl tournament and 7th at the HSNCT Nationals tournament. Torrey Pines regularly places in the top 5 for Science Olympiad (#3 in 2019/2018/2015, #4 in 2017/2016, and #2 in 2015). The Speech and Debate team regularly qualifies individuals to the state level competitions. =Athletics= Programs include Football, Wrestling, Basketball, Men's and Women's Volleyball, Softball, Cross Country, Cheerleading, Men's and Women's Tennis, Track & Field, Soccer, Golf, Gymnastics, Baseball, Lacrosse, Swimming, Surfing, Badminton and Water Polo.

Various groups have consistently received high ranks at local and regional festivals such as SCSBOA each year since 2008. Recently with cuts to the music program, the symphonic band was combined with wind ensemble, and a new choir section and guitar class were opened. Choir has gone on to receive top awards at the Music in the Parks. =Speech and Debate= The speech and debate team participates in events including Congressional debate, Lincoln-Douglas debate, Public Forum debate, speech events, and Parliamentary debate. In 2005, Public Forum debaters competed in the final round of the nationally ranked Tournament of Champions. In 2013, the team qualified multiple people to the Tournament of Champions. In 2015, the team qualified three students to the Tournament of Champions, five students to NSDA nationals, and eleven students to the CHSSA state tournament. In 2016, the team qualified one student to the Tournament of Champions and numerous to the CHSSA tournament. The following year the team again qualified to the Tournament of Champions and CHSSA tournament. In both 2017 and 2018 one Lincoln-Douglas debater qualified for the Tournament of Champions. In 2019 one Congressional debater competed at NSDA nationals. =Publications= The Falconer The Falconer is the monthly school newspaper. It placed first in the 1984 JEA/National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA) Spring National High School Journalism Convention in San Diego and again in March 1999 at the Spring National High School Journalism Convention in Phoenix.

The local Heun function is called a Heun function, denoted Hf, if it is also regular at z = 1, and is called a Heun polynomial, denoted Hp, if it is regular at all three finite singular points z = 0, 1, a. Heun's equation Heun's equation is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form :\\\\frac {d^2w}{dz^2} + \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{z}+ \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{z-1} + \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{z-a} \\\\right] \\\\frac {dw}{dz} \\\\+ \\\\frac {\\\\alpha \\\\beta z -q} {z(z-1)(z-a)} w = 0. The condition \\\\epsilon=\\\\alpha+\\\\beta-\\\\gamma-\\\\delta+1 is needed to ensure regularity of the point at ‚àû. The complex number q is called the accessory parameter. Heun's equation has four regular singular points: 0, 1, a and ‚àû with exponents (0, 1 ‚àí Œ≥), (0, 1 ‚àí Œ¥), (0, 1 ‚àí œµ), and (Œ±, Œ≤). Every second-order linear ODE on the extended complex plane with at most four regular singular points, such as the Lam√© equation or the hypergeometric differential equation, can be transformed into this equation by a change of variable. q-analog The q-analog of Heun's equation has been discovered by and studied by . Symmetries Heun's equation has a group of symmetries of order 192, isomorphic to the Coxeter group of the Coxeter diagram D4, analogous to the 24 symmetries of the hypergeometric differential equations obtained by Kummer. The symmetries fixing the local Heun function form a group of order 24 isomorphic to the symmetric group on 4 points, so there are 192/24 = 8 = 2 √ó 4 essentially different solutions given by acting on the local Heun function by these symmetries, which give solutions for each of the 2 exponents for each of the 4 singular points. The complete list of 192 symmetries was given by using machine calculation. Several previous attempts by various authors to list these by hand contained many errors and omissions; for example, most of the 48 local solutions listed by Heun contain serious errors.

Naturally occurring oleoresins are also known as balsams.  Properties  In contrast to essential oils obtained by steam distillation, oleoresins abound in heavier, less volatile and lipophilic compounds, such as resins, waxes, fats and fatty oils. Gummo-oleoresins (oleo-gum resins, gum resins) occur mostly as crude balsams and contain also water-soluble gums. Oleoresins are prepared from spices, such as basil, capsicum (paprika), cardamom, celery seed, cinnamon bark, clove bud, fenugreek, fir balsam, ginger, jambu, labdanum, mace, marjoram, nutmeg, parsley, pepper (black/white), pimenta (allspice), rosemary, sage, savory (summer/winter), thyme, turmeric, vanilla, and West Indian bay leaves. The solvents used are nonaqueous and may be polar (alcohols) or nonpolar (hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide). Oleoresins are similar to perfumery concretes, obtained especially from flowers, and to perfumery resinoids, which are prepared also from animal secretions.  Use  Most oleoresins are used as flavors and perfumes, some are used medicinally (e. g., oleoresin of dry Cannabis infructescence, Capsicum oleoresin).

Its current daily circulation is placed at 42,000. Founded in 1926, in 1932 it was bought by Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Zelaya, who had become editor-in-chief. He promoted the Conservative Party of Nicaragua and became a voice of opposition to Juan Bautista Sacasa, for which the paper was censored. He continued to be critical of dictator Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a, who came to power in a coup d'etat. Twice the newspaper suffered the destruction of its building in earthquakes, in 1931 and 1972. Forces of Somoza attacked the newspaper's offices in 1953 and 1956, and its work was repeatedly censored. After Chamorro Zelaya died in 1952, his eldest son Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Cardenal succeeded him as editor-in-chief and a voice of opposition. He opposed the excesses of the Somoza regime and came into conflict for his criticism of the regime, including after 1956 when the son Luis Somoza Debayle succeeded his father. History =Early years= La Prensa was founded by Pedro Belli, Gavry Rivas and Enrique Belli on March 2, 1926. In 1930, Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Zelaya became editor-in-chief, and in 1932 he bought the paper with the intention of promoting the principles of the Conservative Party of Nicaragua, as well as publicising historical studies of Nicaragua. In 1931 the office building that housed La Prensa was destroyed, for the first time out of many, in an earthquake that hit Managua. La Prensa suffered its first censorship in 1934 under the orders of Juan Bautista Sacasa, for being overly critical of the government. This began a long history of censorship under many different governments. In 1936 Anastasio Somoza Garcia, who came to power through a coup d'√©tat, began his own censorship of the paper. Threats against La Prensa for their anti-Somocista stance became customary. In 1945, under the guise of national security, the government ordered La Prensa to completely shut down for an indefinite amount of time. =Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Cardenal= In 1952, after the death of Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro, his eldest son, Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Cardenal, became the new editor of La Prensa. He is credited with improving the newspaper's fortunes. Chamorro Cardenal also increased the anti- Somoza rhetoric of his editorials, placing La Prensa at greater risk from the Somoza regime. Somoza subsequently increased his pressure on the editors of La Prensa. On May 22, 1953, one of Somoza's cronies, General Andr√®s Murillo, sent Somocista mobs to assault the newspaper's new building in Managua. Chamorro Cardenal was arrested, sent to military court, imprisoned and allegedly tortured for several months before being released. In 1956, Anastasio Somoza Garcia was assassinated and his son Luis Somoza Debayle succeeded him to power. Like his father, Somoza Debayle had little tolerance for the strong criticism against his regime that was mounted by La Prensa, which claimed to have argued for responsible government, participatory democracy, and neoliberal economic policies. That year, La Prensa was again occupied by Somoza's forces, and Chamorro Cardenal was charged with aiding the conspirators who had killed Debayle's father. He was subsequently jailed and forced to publish condolences to the late dictator Somoza. La Prensa was henceforth subjected to prolonged censorship by the regime. In 1959, Chamorro Cardenal went to Havana, Cuba, to meet with the new revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro, in order to bargain a deal for arms and munitions. After prolonged negotiations, disagreements between the two men resulted in no deal being achieved. But, by May of that year, Chamorro had gathered enough capital and weapons to land 120 men, including himself, in the provinces of Boaco and Chontales, in an attempt to overthrow Somoza Debayle. The invasion failed, which was known as the so-called Guerrilla de Olama y Mollejones, and Chamorro was captured. He was convicted and sentenced to several years in prison. In 1963, La Prensa was praised for launching a literacy campaign, a concept that was later adopted by the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist FSLN. With modest tools, La Prensa caused a nationwide sensation by publishing over 100,000 primers that were the backbone of the National Literacy Campaign. They circulated maps of Nicaragua to millions who had never had the opportunity the study one in school. The program was distributed by UNESCO to local \\"teachers\\". Notably, future Sandinistas such as Ernesto Cardenal, Sergio Ramirez, Gioconda Belli Murillo, and Carlos Mej√≠a Godoy all contributed to the campaign. But that year Somoza ordered the dissolution of the Patriotic Literacy Campaign's National Committee. On December 23, 1972 the headquarters of La Prensa was destroyed in the massive earthquake that leveled most of Managua. Chamorro rebuilt the newspaper's offices on the \\"North Highway\\" and it reopened in March 1973. During the next years, resistance rose against Somoza in numerous quarters of Nicaragua. La Prensa continued to be a voice of opposition even as several radio talk shows and media outlets were being shut down by the government. In August 1978, Chamorro loaned 50,000 Cordobas from the newspaper to a Sandinista operation, which was never repaid. On the morning of January 10, 1978, Chamorro was blocked on his way to work by a green Toyota. He was shot by several rounds from a shotgun and died in an ambulance on the way to a nearby hospital. It is widely believed in Nicaragua that Somoza's son, \\"El Chig√ºin\\", was behind the murder. Chamorro became a martyr, and his assassination helped ignite widespread opposition to the Somoza government. Many of the middle and upper classes supported the Sandinista insurgency after his murder. His assassination was a catalyst for the beginning of the final mass insurrection against Somoza. As Somoza went into exile from Nicaragua, he ordered a final destruction of La Prensa by his Guardsmen, who used kerosene to light the building on fire. La Prensa was rebuilt within months. =The Sandinistas= After the fall of the government, Chamorro's widow, Violeta, served on the five-member Junta of National Reconstruction. However, Chamorro and the middle-class supporters of the revolution had a different vision for the country than the Sandinistas. When it became apparent that these differences could not be resolved, Violeta Chamorro resigned from the junta in 1980 and began to oppose the Sandinistas. At this point there was a split among the staff of La Prensa. The editor Xavier Chamorro Cardenal, together with 80% of the staff, left the paper to form El Nuevo Diario, a more pro- Sandinista paper. Soon after the Junta passed new laws, freedom of the press became subject to many political criteria. On July 22, 1979 the Law of National Emergency allowed all media in Nicaragua to be placed under government control. On September 10, 1980, decrees 511 and 512 established prior censorship for matters of national security. In this period the US, with the support of La Prensa, started its campaign against the Sandinista government, by giving secret financial and arms support to the Contras.The CIA-Contra-Crack Cocaine Controversy, US Department of Justice In this struggle under the Sandinistas, La Prensa was also often accused of being a puppet of the CIA. The staff were accused of being Contra sympathizers and thus, \\"vende-patrias\\" (‚Äòmotherland-sellers‚Äô) or traitors to the motherland. The paper admitted receiving funds from the National Endowment for Democracy, a bipartisan, Congressionally financed agency created to take over financing of groups that in the past had received covert aid from the CIA. But La Prensa staff claimed that this funding was publicly declared and legal.Furor in Nicaragua on C.I.A. Charges, New York Times, September 24, 1988 On March 15, 1982, the government declared a State of Emergency, and closed down all independent broadcast new programs. Sandinista censorship began clamping down on political dissent and criticism. That same year La Prensa was occupied three times by Sandinista forces, and it was constantly surrounded by Sandinista mobs. Under the FSLN this pattern of hostility continued throughout the years of Sandinista rule. During the 1980s, La Prensa received extensive subventions from the United States National Endowment for Democracy. La Prensa's strident criticism of Sandinista policies, particularly its economic policies, and its attacks on FSLN leader Daniel Ortega allegedly led the Sandinistas to adopt various restrictions on press freedom. La Prensa editors claimed that they were harassed by state security and that it was sometimes censored or closed, although it had a significantly higher circulation than the Sandinista \\"Barricade\\" (70 thousand copies against 45 in 1986). The restrictions were lifted in a deal between Ortega and his opponents in the run-up to the 1990 election. In April 2018 La Prensa began criticizing the Ortega government. Following its series of articles about human rights violations in October and November of that year, the government imposed a blockade of paper, ink, and other printing supplies. News media Confidencial and 100% Noticias were looted and confiscated, journalists Miguel Mora and Luc√≠a Pineda Ubau were arrested, and the work of 68 exiled reporters was disrupted. Negotiations in March 2019 led to a promise to lift the blockade in October 2019, but the government did not keep its promise. The blockade was not lifted until February 2020, after 75 weeks, but the newspaper must still pay off its debts before receiving the material it needs in order to operate. Current positions La Prensa generally supports neoliberal economics and is largely aligned with the United States government. It is generally conservative on social issues, and identifies closely with the Catholic Church (its cancellation of a weekly column written by Church theologians sparked a minor controversy). However, the paper has attacked ex-President and PLC Leader Arnoldo Alem√°n for corruption, opposed the political agreement between Alem√°n and Daniel Ortega, and challenged the perceived weak government of conservative President Enrique Bola√±os. It has also challenged the outspoken comments of the current U.S. ambassador Paul Trivelli regarding Nicaraguan affairs.

He also received a master's degree in political science from UCLA in 1956. Planning for a career in academia, he served as an assistant professor of political science at California State University, Los Angeles for two years. Eventually, Los Angeles independent television station KCOP approached Fishman to teach an on-air course, and later, the station invited him to anchor his own segment. Fishman had been on the air continuously since June 20, 1960, moving from KCOP to KTLA in 1965. That year, he received significant exposure as a field reporter for KTLA when he helped cover the Watts Riots live from the Los Angeles Police Department command center. Fishman also worked at KTTV and KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) during the early 1970s, returning to KTLA on January 8, 1975, to anchor their evening new broadcast NewsWatch, later renamed News at Ten. =Notable events covered= As a news anchor, Fishman covered numerous events in Los Angeles and the world, ranging from the assassination of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, to the Sylmar and Northridge earthquakes, to Pope John Paul II's 1987 visit to southern California. He, along with KTLA, was credited for being the first to air footage of the police beating of Rodney King in 1991, an event that sparked riots a year later when the officers were acquitted. In 2000, KTLA dedicated its newsroom in Fishman's honor, commemorating his 40 years in television and his years of service and commitment to the region.Hal Fishman 1931-2007  Hal's Life And Career =Honors= Fishman won myriad awards, including the Associated Press Television-Radio Association's first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award. He received a \\"star\\" on the Hollywood \\"Walk of Fame,\\" at 1560 Vine Street and KTLA named its television news studio after Fishman. He also authored two novels, Flight 902 Is Down (co-authored with aviation writer Barry J. Schiff) and The Vatican Target. Fishman was also an accomplished pilot and set 13 records for speed and altitude. In 1969, he was awarded the Louis Bl√©riot medal by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale. =Death= Hal Fishman's last broadcast was on July 30, 2007, eight days before his death.KTLA The CW  Where Los Angeles Lives On July 31, 2007, the night before Fishman became ill and after his last broadcast, KTLA celebrated his 47 years in television with a special gala at the Autry National Museum in Los Angeles. The event was emceed by Morning Show anchor Michaela Pereira and attended by such dignitaries as Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Los Angeles County sheriff Lee Baca. During the gala, Fishman spoke to the audience about his time in television. He appeared somewhat fatigued but little would be known about his condition until the day after.Celebrating Hal Fishman  KTLA The CW  Celebrating 60 Years Fishman died August 7, 2007 at home, 18 days before he would have turned 76, following recent treatment for a liver infection, which had detected cancer in his liver and colon. That morning, the station interrupted its regular news schedule and dedicated much of the Morning Show and Prime News broadcasts to Fishman. The reporters on Prime News did not break for commercials that evening.

Oerter, \\"Campaldino, 1289,\\" Speculum, 43:3 (1968), 429‚Äì50, provides a complete account, with maps. Mixed bands of pro-papal Guelf forces of Florence and allies, Pistoia, Lucca, Siena, and Prato, all loosely commanded by the paid condottiero Amerigo di Narbona with his own professional following, met a Ghibelline force from Arezzo including the perhaps reluctant bishop, Guglielmino degli Ubertini, in the plain of Campaldino, which leads from Pratovecchio to Poppi, part of the Tuscan countryside along the upper Arno called the Casentino. One of the combatants on the Guelph side was Dante Alighieri, twenty-four years old at the time. Background to the battle Later, in the mid-14th century, Giovanni Villani recorded the long-remembered details‚Äî as Florentines remembered them‚Äî in his chronicle, though the casus belli he offers are merely conventional \\"outrages\\" on the part of Arezzo; the elaborately staged raid and fight led by aristocrats on both sides sounds like stylized gang warfare, though carried out, according to Villani, under the battle standard of the absent Charles, the Angevine King of Naples. The immediate cause of the battle were reports that the Guelphs were ravaging the places of Conte Guido Novello, who was podest√† of Arezzo, and, worse, threatening the fortified place called Bibbiena Civitella. This led to an Aretine force being quickly assembled and marching out to counter the threat. It was reported by Villani that a plot had been intercepted at Arezzo, by which the bishop agreed to give over to the Florentines Bibbiena Civitella, and all the villages of his see, in return for a life annuity of 5,000 golden florins a year, guaranteed by the bank of the Cerchi family. The plot was uncovered by his nephew Guglielmo de' Pazzi, and they hustled the bishop onto his horse and brought him to the battlefield, where they left him dead among the slain of the battle and its aftermath: Guglielmino de' Pazzi in Valdarno and Buonconte, the son of Guido I da Montefeltro. Opposing forces = Guelph army = The Guelphs had the numerical advantage in the battle, with about 12,000 combatants. Most of these troops had been raised by Florence, and were generally well-equipped due to their hometown's wealth. Florence was well known at the time as a producer of highly regarded weapons and armour, and its troops probably had better weaponry than the Ghibellines. The Florentines were reinforced by other Tuscan Guelphs, including Bologna, Pistoia, Lucca, San Gimignano, San Miniato, Siena, Volterra, and other small towns. Furthermore, small contingents of Guelphs from Romagna and Guelph exiles from Arezzo fought at Campaldino. The Guelph cavalry lacked combat experience and suffered from indiscipline, so that the about 10,000 infantrymen formed the actual core of the Guelph army. At least half of the infantry were better-trained specialists who operated as spearmen, pavisiers, crossbowmen, and archers, while the rest consisted of less effective, but still reliable militiamen. In general, the Italian Guelph troops were less experienced than the Ghibellines. In addition to these local forces, about 400 French knights of Amerigo di Narbona's retinue fought at Campaldino; they were experienced veterans who were highly regarded for their combat prowess. The Guelph army was officially led by Amerigo di Narbona, who served as Charles II of Naples's representative for Tuscany and had been appointed as a compromise, since the Italian Guelphs could not agree on one of their own to lead them. Though he probably possessed some combat experience and proved to be a competent commander, Amerigo's relative lack of military skill, youth, and the fact that he did not speak Tuscan Italian meant that his command of the army was mostly nominal. As a result, the de facto leader of the army was a Carcassonne knight in Amerigo's retinue, Guillaume da Durfort, a highly experienced veteran of several wars. Under these two, several Italian Guelphs served as sub-commanders, with the most notable being Corso Donati, Vieri de' Cerchi, and the Barone de Mangiadori. =Ghibelline army = The Ghibelline army was of similar size, but differed drastically in its composition from the Guelph force. Unlike their opponents, the Ghibellines relied less on ad hoc city militias and were instead mostly composed of feudal lords and their retinues, who were generally much better trained and more experienced than their opponents. The Ghibelline cavalry and infantry were thus of higher quality than their opponents, with Villani describing them as \\"the flower of the Ghibellines of Tuscany, of the March, and of the Duchy, and of Romagna\\" who were \\"practised in weapons and in war\\". The Ghibelline infantry consisted of fewer spearmen, pavisiers, and crossbowmen than its Guelph counterparts; instead, it relied on offensive close-quarters combat with swords and bucklers. Despite this, many Ghibelline fiefs were rather poor, and both their cavalry and infantry were probably less well equipped than the Guelphs. The Ghibelline army had three main commanders: First, Guglielmo Ubertini who had served for forty years as the bishop of Arezzo by the time of the battle. \\"A man of the sword as much as of the pen\\", Ubertini had proven to be a capable, ruthless, and brave military commander during several conflicts before 1289, though his strategic acumen was impeded by his interest in defending the possessions of his family at any cost. This greatly influenced his decision to seek battle at Campaldino, despite having been advised against it. The second most important Ghibelline commander was Guido Novello Guidi, the Count of Poppi, a veteran of several campaigns, and long-time leader of the Ghibelline cause in Tuscany. A shrewd and opportunistic politician and military leader, he was one of the few Ghibelline commanders to survive the Battle of Campaldino. Finally, there was Buonconte di Montefeltro, an accomplished strategist and tactician who had led the Ghibellines to a \\"brilliant\\" victory at Pieve al Toppo in 1288. Montefeltro was one of those who argued against seeking battle at Campaldino, but nevertheless drew up a good battle-plan when forced to do so. The battle =Deployment= The Florentines deployed an advance guard of cavalry, behind which, in the centre of their line stood the bulk of their cavalry. On each wing they placed their infantry, slightly forward so the line was crescent shaped. Behind this force, they drew up their baggage and, behind that, a reserve of infantry and cavalry. The Aretines drew up in four lines; the first, second, and fourth of cavalry, the third of infantry. =The course of the battle= The Aretines attacked with their first three lines, scattering the Florentine advanced guard and pushing back the main body towards the wagons. However, they now came under crossfire from the flanking infantry. The Florentine reserve now made a flanking attack, trapping the Aretines.Mallett (1974), p. 23 According to Villani, Corso Donati, podest√† of Pistoia, though under orders to stand ready in reserve, shouted ‚ÄúIf we lose, I will die in the battle with my fellow citizens; and if we conquer, let him that will, come to us at Pistoia to exact the penalty!‚Äù and charged the Aretine flank, helping break up the lines and win the day for the Guelphs. Instead of coming to the rescue, the Aretine reserve fled. Aretine casualties were high. Ploughing the Campaldino plain used to turn up human remains and bones as recently as eighty years ago.. Result of the battle The Battle of Campaldino secured Guelph dominance in Florence, though internecine fighting among the Whites and Blacks among the Florentine Guelphs resulted in civic disturbances and the exile of many, including notable medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri (a member of the Whites, the faction more opposed to papal power).

She is a professor of history and the Coordinator of Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies at Salem State University in Massachusetts. She previously taught at Bates College in Maine and was a Research Associate at Harvard University, where she specialized in Caribbean and Latin American history. Early life She is the eldest daughter of linguists Noam and Carol Chomsky. Her paternal grandfather, William Chomsky (1896‚Äì1977), was a Hebrew scholar at Gratz College where he served as principal for many years. Career and education Between 1976 and 1977, Chomsky worked for the United Farm Workers union. She credited this experience with sparking her \\"interest in the Spanish language, in migrant workers and immigration, in labor history, in social movements and labor organizing, in multinationals and their workers, in how global economic forces affect individuals, and how people collectively organize for social change\\". At the University of California at Berkeley, she earned a B.A. in Spanish and Portuguese in 1982, an M.A. in history in 1985, and a Ph.D. in history in 1990. She began teaching at Bates College, and became an associate professor of history at Salem State College in 1997, the Coordinator of Latin American Studies in 1999, and a full professor in 2002. Chomsky's book West Indian Workers and the United Fruit Company in Costa Rica 1870‚Äì1940 was awarded the 1997 Best Book Prize by the New England Council of Latin American Studies. It describes the history of the United Fruit Company, formed in 1899 from the merger of multiple U.S.-based companies that built railroads and cultivated bananas on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica. It also shows how the workers, including many Jamaicans originally of African descent, developed their own parallel socioeconomic system. Chomsky has been active in Latin American solidarity and immigrants‚Äô rights issues since the 1980s. She is a member of the North Shore Colombia Solidarity Committee. Her articles on immigration rights have appeared in The Nation, HuffPost and TomDispatch, a project of The Nation Institute, and she has delivered lectures across the world on labor rights and immigration rights.

It marks the third album of his children's music, after the For Little Ones portion of A Gift from a Flower to a Garden and H.M.S. Donovan. Pied Piper was released in both the UK and US (Rhino 78290) on 19 March 2002. History After it became apparent that Sutras was going to be the only Donovan album released on Rick Rubin's American Recordings label, Donovan withdrew from releasing new music. His focus shifted to restructuring his business by organizing a website and creating his own record label, Donovan Discs. He also began to write an autobiography and search for studio tapes that were deep in record company archives. In the meantime, Beat Goes On Records reissued many of Donovan's albums in the UK. Many of these albums had been out of print since their original vinyl release. With the combination of selecting rare albums and offering them on-line, Beat Goes On Records were able to capitalize on these releases by selling them in the US as imports. These releases included two of his children's albums, For Little Ones (from A Gift from a Flower to a Garden) and H.M.S. Donovan. In light of these releases, Rhino Records subsidiary Music for Little People contacted Donovan to release another children's album. He recorded new songs and new versions of many of his children's songs for the subsequent album, Pied Piper. The album name and title track both come from the 1972 Jacques Demy film The Pied Piper which starred Donovan as the Pied Piper. The album was released in conjunction with his new label and became the first release by Donovan Discs.

It is notable for the unusual lodges that adorn each corner in a style that could be likened to miniature Greek temples. Location The bridge links the A4 (London Road) in Walcot on the north side of the Avon, with the A36 in Bathwick, via Bathwick Street at the point where it is joined by St. John's Road.Landranger Map 172: Bristol & Bath. Published by the Ordnance Survey History Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826,Inscription on bridge by William Hazledine (Coalbrookdale Ironworks) with Henry Goodridge as the architect, on the site of a Roman ferry crossing. Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, it spans the River Avon at Bathwick, and enabled further development of Georgian Bath to take place on the south side of the river. It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day, horse-drawn vehicles and pedestrians, and was constructed using the warm golden Bath Stone and an elegant cast-iron arched span. 'The New Bridge at Bathwick' (1830 engraving by FP Hay) A toll house was required to charge users of the bridge for the privilege of crossing. Rather than building merely one, Goodridge decided to install four -- one on each corner -- in order to maintain the absolute symmetry of his elegant neoclassical design. He provided each of these lodges with columns fronting onto the bridge, giving them the appearance of small ancient temples. This is what still gives the bridge its unique appearance today. Only one of the four (Number 1 next to St John's Road) was actually used as a toll house; the rest were always let to private tenants as small dwellings or shops. Given the small size of these dwellings (one room upstairs, two on the middle floor and one that would have flooded each winter in the basement) it seems extraordinary that the 1891 UK census clearly records a family of three people and two lodgers living in one of the lodges. The bridge was constructed using funds subscribed by numerous local wealthy citizens to a specially formed Bathwick Bridge Company with a view to investors making a return on investment through the toll charges. In order to establish the bridge and the company an Act of Parliament was required and, in a move which would later prove the undoing of the company, the level of the toll was fixed at one penny. Unfortunately for the shareholders of the Bathwick Bridge Company, inflation took hold during the 19th century and, by the early 20th century, a one penny toll was not worth much. By the 1920s, the revenues from tolls no longer covered the costs of operating and maintaining the bridge. The Bath Corporation Act of 1925 allowed the City Council to take over the bridge from the now bankrupt Bathwick Bridge Company. To much celebration, it was freed it from tolls for all traffic on 20 June 1927 and extensively restored during 1928 and 1929. Cleveland Bridge is still free to use today, although the next bridge upstream at Bathampton is one of the UK's few remaining privately owned toll bridges. After the Second World War, a shortage of cash and materials and a general lack of interest in Bath's architecture meant that the fabric of the bridge was neglected. By the 1980s, three out of four of the lodges were derelict and unfit for human habitation. Concerned at the neglect of this unique structure by its owners, Bath and North East Somerset Council, a group of local individuals formed a charity (the Bath Historical Buildings Trust) to take a very long lease on three of the lodges and to restore them so that they could once again become homes for people. This work is almost complete. In 2019 a survey showed some structural parts were near end of life, resulting in a temporary 18-tonne weight restriction being imposed from January 2020. It is anticipated major repair work will be carried out in 2020, subject to government funding, involving the temporary closure of the bridge. Capacity Cleveland Bridge during Bath's rush hour Around the same time that the bridge was freed from toll, heavier vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine were making their way onto the roads. The slender cast iron span of Cleveland Bridge required reinforcement. Four reinforced concrete trusses were inserted under the roadway around 1929, giving it the strength which today allows it to carry 38 tonne trucks. Bath has no eastern bypass, so the bridge has become a heavily used \\"Euro route\\" for large trucks on their way from Britain's south coast ports to the docks further north. High volumes of local traffic at peak travelling times make this a regular traffic slow spot in the mornings and evenings, carrying 17,000 vehicles a day. Emergency services connection Despite the frequent traffic jams on Cleveland Bridge, Bath's only fire and ambulance stations are located next to it and the drivers of emergency vehicles are assertive in expressing their need to cross on the way to respond to an emergency call. The connection between the bridge and these services is long established because the lodge formerly used as a toll house (Number 1) was the 999 response centre for the city of Bath for some time after the Second World War. The bridge today The distinctive lodges of Cleveland Bridge are now restored to their former glory and are back in use as homes. One, however, remains a working premises. Sculptures by ceramic artist Peter Hayes are on display around the world but he still works from a studio below his gallery at lodge number 2. His techniques for creating a patina include immersing half-completed pieces for a period of months in the river, where they absorb minerals from the water.

It is found in New Zealand, Hawaiian Islands, Borneo, Java, New Guinea, islands of the Pacific Ocean to Australia and the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. Description The name Coprosma means \\"smelling like dung\\" and refers to the smell (methanethiol) given out by the crushed leaves of a few species. Many species are small shrubs with tiny evergreen leaves, but a few are small trees and have much larger leaves. The flowers have insignificant petals and are wind- pollinated, with long anthers and stigmas. Natural hybrids are common. The fruit is a non-poisonous juicy berry, most often bright orange (but can be dark red or even light blue), containing two small seeds. The orange fruit of the larger species were eaten by MƒÅori children, and are also popular with birds. It is said that coffee can be made from the seeds, Coprosma being related to the coffee plants. A notable feature (also found in other genera of Rubiaceae) is that the leaves contain hollows in the axils of the veins; in these, and on the leaf stipules, nitrogen-fixing bacteria grow. In addition the hollows, or domatia, encourage certain kinds of mites to take up residence, which feed on and reduce parasitic fungi which attack the leaf.

Ticket and snack prices were kept low, partly because the theater was staffed almost entirely by volunteer teenagers and run partly on donations. The foundation ran several film-related programs for seniors, mothers and youth. It also provided direct financial and promotional support to other local nonprofit organizations. The theater is located on Fairfield's main street, 1424 Post Road. Volunteers and finances Except for the general manager of the premises, the staff is mostly under the age of eighteen, and the theater is a popular place for teens to earn community service hours in order to apply for college. According to the theater's Web site, it costs more than $20,000 a year to maintain the building, including more than $7,500 a year in maintenance costs for the 75-year-old marquee sign and $10,000-plus for the new DVD projection system's 35mm film projection equipment (replacement cost for one film projector would be $75,000).

History The theater first began operation in 1920 as a local moviehouse. It added a second screen room in 1979. There are many stories regarding the theater's changing construction. For instance, behind one of the balconies, there used to be an office. It was accompanied with a lounge, but in 1950, the owner decided to make the office bigger, compromising the lounge. A lift would raise an organ out of the basement and onto the stage. The theater was also home to stage performances in the past but was converted into a movie theater in the 1970s. Starting in the late 1990s, the Loew's chain attempted to run it as an art house, but failed and had to close it down in the spring of 2001. Berger, Joseph, \\"What We Have Here Is Success,\\" article in (Sunday) Connecticut section (Section 14, page 1) of The New York Times, July 23, 2006, accessed July 22, 2006(You can access many stories in the newspaper's Sunday edition a day beforehand). Leo Redgate, a real estate investor in town who remembered seeing \\"Jaws\\" at the moviehouse as a kid, decided it would be good for the community to revive the place. He created the theater foundation, invested his own money to fix up the building, and rounded up volunteers, including high school students. By the end of 2001, the theater was open again. But now the foundation faces another challenge. Repairs are desperately needed to the property, which Redgate would like to buy from the Pollack family. He has made a couple of multimillion-dollar offers, but Norman Pollack told the Fairfield Citizen-News that the seven members of the family who make up the limited liability company are not inclined to sell at this time. Redgate is not asking for anything unreasonable in wanting to buy the property. The lease even states that he can match any offer the Pollacks receive - whether now or 10 years from now - for as long as he still rents the place. Among the goals of the foundation were to restore and operate the theater and provide affordable entertainment, unite young people in the spirit of volunteerism, and act as a catalyst for community involvement, inspiration, and support. However, Redgate failed to deliver on his promises when the foundation faced financial struggles owing more than eighty thousand dollars on the lease and over fifteen thousand to film distributors and services provided to the foundation. The Fairfield Citizen reported that Redgate's decision in stepping away from the foundation had nothing to do with the financial struggles it was facing and two lawsuits that were filed by Buena Vista Pictures and Sony Pictures . Redgate left a lot in question when he claimed that \\"there is no issue with the non-profit status\\" when in fact the Internal Revenue Service revoked the non-profit status in 2010. The theatre's final public showing was held on September 8, 2011. The Fairfield Citizen reported that new leasing efforts were underway to find someone who would be willing to take over the Fairfield landmark.

The anime is produced by Madhouse Production and originally conceptualized by Clamp, who also designed the characters. The series features three girls, Kanoko, Kate, and Pop, who live in the city of Asialand. Asialand looks like a normal city, but it is always under attack from evil monsters. The girls are on their way to take the test to get their moped licenses, but accidentally catch the attention of the living enigma, Ear Hermit. Instead of receiving moped licenses, they acquire a \\"Valerian License\\" which, to their shock and horror, transforms them into bunny-like creatures, the Relaxation Combat Team Valerian. In these forms, they are known as Serotonin, Dopamine, and Valerian. The heroines are aided by a unique panda-esque companion, Panda-bu and nifty card-swiping/magic- transformation gadgets. Together as Sweet Valerian, they defend justice when the evil Stress Team takes advantage of people's stress and turns them into monsters. The series is targeted at a very young audience. Characters ; : : Kanoko's father used to be the manager of the large company, but now works as an inventor. She herself is poor and is all time taking on a new job, because she gets fired for having to leave and fight monsters all the time. She transforms into the white bunny Valerian by using the \\"bracelet of the flower\\" which is attached to her left arm. She is the blond character, and is the leader of the team. She tries to get the monsters to talk instead of fight, but then she ends up attacking first anyway. Powdered Valerian root is often used as a mellowing sleep aid. ; : : The Chief Executive Officer of a video game company called \\"Leek Cartridge\\", Pop transforms into the grey bunny Dopamine using the \\"digital clock wind\\" wristband. When she transforms, she says \\"Appear, Dopamine!\\" and can call wild birds with a whistle. She is the dark-skinned girl who always wears hats. She is usually the one who comes up with the plan to defeat the monsters. Dopamine is a chemical in the brain which affects adrenalin and the functions of memory, attention, and problem- solving. ; : : A model and up-and-coming movie star, she transforms into the yellow bunny Seratonin using an earring and a compact. She is often \\"busy\\" with other jobs and tends to speak in a monotonous tone. When she transforms, she says \\"Come out, Seratonin!\\". A black-haired girl with a strange character, Kate also happens to be into the occult. She owns a crystal ball and makes tea using a chemistry set. Seratonin is the chemical in the brain which causes happiness. ; : : Informs the heroines when a stress monster is attacking the city. He has three children and says \\"bu\\" at the end of each sentence. Panda- bu also serves as the narrator of the series. ; : : A group of evildoers who turn people's stress into monsters.

It may have taken place on a plain east of Alcal√° del R√≠o, Seville, Spain, near the village of Esquivel, the site of the Carthaginian camp. Though it may not seem to be as original as Hannibal‚Äôs tactic at Cannae, Scipio's pre-battle maneuver and his reverse Cannae formation stands as the acme of his tactical ability, in which he forever broke the Carthaginian hold in Iberia, thus denying any further land invasion into Italy and cutting off a rich base for the Barca dynasty both in silver and manpower. Prelude After the Battle of Baecula and Hasdrubal Barca‚Äôs departure, further Carthaginian reinforcements were landed in Iberia in early 207 BC under Hanno, who soon joined Mago Barca. Together they were raising a powerful army by the heavy recruitment of Celtiberian mercenaries. Meanwhile, Hasdrubal Gisco also advanced his army from Gades into Andalusia. Thus Scipio was facing two concentrated enemy forces, one of which would no doubt fall on his rear if he tried to attack the other. After careful planning, Scipio decided to send a detachment under Marcus Junius Silanus to strike Mago first. Marching with great speed, Silanus was able to achieve complete surprise when he fell on the Carthaginian camps, which resulted in the dispersion of Mago's Celtiberians and Hanno's capture. Thus Hasdrubal was left alone in facing Scipio's concentrated force, but the Carthaginian general was able to avoid battle by splitting his troops among fortified cities. The Iberian campaign of 207 BC ended without any further major action. Pre-battle maneuver The next spring, the Carthaginians launched their last great effort to recover their Iberian holdings. Mago was joined at Ilipa by Hasdrubal Gisco, creating a force estimated at 54,000 to 74,000, considerably larger than Scipio's army of 48,000 men, which was composed of a large number of Spanish allies who were not as seasoned as Roman legionaries. Livy's figures, however, give the Carthaginian army 50,000 infantry and 4,500 cavalry (where he mentioned other sources give the figure of 70,000, such as Polybius at 11.20, but Livy believes it was the lesser number), whilst he puts Scipio's force at 55,000 men, so it was also possible Scipio outnumbered the Carthaginians by a slight margin.Livy, 28.13 Upon the arrival of the Romans, Mago unleashed a daring attack on the Roman camp with most of his cavalry, under his Numidian ally Masinissa. However, this was foreseen by Scipio, who had concealed his own cavalry behind a hill, which charged into the Carthaginian flank, and threw back the enemy with heavy losses on Mago's side. The two opponents spent the next few days observing and testing each other, with Scipio always waiting to lead out his troops only after the Carthaginians had advanced from their camp first. The Roman formation always presented the legions in the center and Iberians on the wings, thus leading Hasdrubal and Mago to believe that this would be the Roman arrangement on the day of battle. Battle Battle formation on previous days. Change of the Roman battle formation by Scipio and his attack on the Carthaginian flanks. Believing his deception had taken a firm hold on the Carthaginian commanders, Scipio made his move. First he ordered the army to be fed and armed before daylight. He then promptly sent his cavalry and light troops (velites) against the Carthaginian outposts at daybreak, while advancing with his main force behind, all the way to the front of the Carthaginian position. This day his legions stood at the wings and the Iberians in the centre. Surprised by the Romans' sudden attacks, the Carthaginians rushed to arm themselves and sallied forth without breakfast. Still believing that Scipio would arrange his force in the earlier fashion, Hasdrubal deployed his elite Africans in the centre and the Spanish mercenaries on his wings; he was not able to change formation after discovering the new Roman arrangement because the opposing army was too close, as Scipio had ordered his troops to form for battle closer to the Carthaginian camp. For the next few hours Scipio held back his infantry behind the skirmishing light troops and thus amplified the effect of the missed breakfast on his enemy. When he finally decided to attack, the light troops were called back through the space between the maniples to position themselves behind the legions on the wings; then the main advance began. With his wings advancing at a faster pace than the Iberians in his center, Scipio formed a concave, or reverse Cannae, battle line. Furthermore, the Roman general expanded his wings by ordering the light troops to the flanks of the legionaries, and the cavalry to the flank of the light troops, thus enveloping the whole Carthaginian line on both sides. Still refusing his center, Scipio's legions, light troops, and cavalry attacked the half-trained Spaniards on the Carthaginian wings from front, flank, and rear respectively. The Carthaginian center was helpless to reinforce its wings with the threat of the Iberian force that was looming large in the near distance but not yet attacking. With the inevitable destruction of its wings, the Carthaginian center was further demoralized and confused by the trampling by their own maddened elephants, which were being driven towards the center by the Roman cavalry attacking the flanks. Combined with hunger and fatigue, the Carthaginians started to withdraw, at first in good order. But as Scipio now pressed his advantage by ordering his Iberian center into battle, the Carthaginians crumbled, and a massacre that might have rivaled the one in Cannae was only averted by a sudden downpour, which brought a hold to all actions on the field, and enabled the remaining Carthaginians to seek refuge in their camp. After-battle maneuvers Although temporarily safe in their camp, the Carthaginians were not able to rest. Facing the inevitable Roman attack the next morning, they were obliged to strengthen their defenses. But, as more and more Spanish mercenaries deserted the Carthaginians as night drew forward, Hasdrubal tried to slip away with his remaining men in darkness. Scipio immediately ordered a pursuit. Led by the cavalry, the whole Roman army was hot on Hasdrubal's tail. When the Romans finally caught up with the Carthaginian host, the butchery began. Hasdrubal was left with only 6,000 men, who then fled to a mountain top without any water supply. This remnant of the Carthaginian army surrendered a short time later, but not before Hasdrubal and Mago had made good their escape. Aftermath After the battle, Hasdrubal Gisco departed for Africa to visit the powerful Numidian king Syphax, in whose court he was met by Scipio, who was also courting the favor of the Numidians. Mago Barca fled to the Balearics, whence he would sail to Liguria and attempt an invasion of northern Italy. After his final subjugation of Carthaginian Iberia and revenge upon the Iberian chieftains, whose betrayal had led to the death of his father and uncle, Scipio returned to Rome. He was elected consul in 205 BC with a near- unanimous nomination, and after receiving the Senate's consent, he would have the control of Sicily as proconsul, from where his invasion of the Carthaginian homeland would be realized.

SSTL was founded in 1985, following successful trials on the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components on satellites, cumulating in the UoSat-1 test satellite. It funds research projects with the university's Surrey Space Centre, which does research into satellite and space topics.

In 2020, SSTL started the creation of a telecommunications spacecraft for lunar missions. It will be completed in 2024 and used for data transmission to Earth.  History  =Background and early years= During the early decades of the Cold War era, access to space was effectively the privilege of a handful of superpowers; by the 1970s, only the most affluent of countries could afford to engage in space programmes due to extreme complexity and expensive involved. Despite the exorbitant costs to produce and launch, early satellites could only offer limited functionality, having no ability to be reprogrammed once in orbit. During the late 1970s, a group of researchers at the University of Surrey, headed by Martin Sweeting, were experimenting with the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components in satellite construction; if found viable, such techniques would be highly disruptive to the established satellite industry. The team's first satellite, UoSat-1, was assembled in a small university lab, using in a cleanroom fabricated from B&Q; and integrating printed circuit boards designed by hand on a kitchen table. In 1981, UoSAT-1 was launched with NASA's aid; representing the first modern reprogrammable small satellite, it outlived its planned three-year life by more than five years. Having successfully demonstrated that relatively compact and inexpensive satellites could be rapidly built to perform sophisticated missions, the team decided to take further steps to commercialise their research. During 1985, Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) was founded in Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom as a spin-off venture from the university. Since its founding, it has steadily grown, having worked with numerous international customers to launch over 70 satellites over the course of three decades. =Growth and restructuring= In 2002, SSTL moved into remote sensing services with the launch of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) and an associated child company, DMC International Imaging. Some of these satellites also include other imaging payloads and experimental payloads: onboard hardware-based image compression (on BilSAT), a GPS reflectometry experiment and onboard Internet router (on the UK-DMC satellite). The DMC satellites are notable for communicating with their ground stations using the Internet Protocol for payload data transfer and command and control, so extending the Internet into space, and allowing experiments with the Interplanetary Internet to be carried out.Use of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle Protocol from Space , L.Wood et al., Conference paper IAC-08-B2.3.10, 59th International Astronautical Congress, Glasgow, September 2008.UK-DMC satellite first to transfer sensor data from space using 'bundle' protocol , press release, Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, 11 September 2008. Many of the technologies used in the design of the DMC satellites, including Internet Protocol use, were tested in space beforehand on SSTL's earlier UoSAT-12 satellite.K. Hogie, et al., Putting more Internet nodes in space , CSC World, Computer Sciences Corporation, pp. 21-23, April/June 2006. During June 2004, American private space company SpaceX arranged to acquire a 10% stake in SSTL from Surrey University; speaking on the purchase, Elon Musk stated: \\"SSTL is a high-quality company that is probably the world leader in small satellites. We look at this as more a case of similar corporate cultures getting together\\". In April 2008, Surrey University agreed to sell its majority share in SSTL, roughly 80% of the company's capital, to European multinational conglomerate EADS Astrium.\\"EADS Astrium signs an agreement to acquire Surrey Satellite Technology Limited from the University of Surrey.\\" University of Surrey, 7 April 2008. SSTL has remained an independent entity despite all shares having been purchased by Airbus, the parent company of EADS Astrium. During 2005, SSTL completed construction of GIOVE-A1, the first test satellite for Europe's Galileo space navigation system. In 2010 and 2012, the firm was awarded contracts to supply 22 navigation payloads for Galileo, the last of which was delivered during 2016. During 2017, SSTL was awarded a contract to supply a further 12 payloads; this was viewed as a coup in light of the political backdrop surrounding Brexit. During the 2010s, SSTL has been working on various improvements in its satellite technology, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as well as smaller and lighter units. According to Luis Gomes, SSTL's head of Earth observation, micro-satellites translate to a lower cost of design, construction and launch, albeit at a cost of a more frequent failure rate, in comparison to larger and more costly units. These features has been marketed towards customers such as the DMC. In summer 2008, Surrey formed an American subsidiary, Surrey Satellite Technology-US, in Englewood, Colorado, intent on serving US customers in the smallsat market. In June 2017, SSTL announced their intention to close their Colorado satellite manufacturing facility, opting to instead consolidate all of its manufacturing activity in the UK. Sarah Parker, SSTL's managing director, the rapid growth of new competing firms in the small satellite sector had changed the marketplace, necessitating reorganisation, which has included the increased use of outsourcing.

It is currently operated as a summer only service by Great Western Railway between London Paddington and Newquay. The origins After completion of the lines to Bude in 1898 and Padstow in 1899, the London & South Western Railway (L&SWR;) introduced the first North Cornwall Express in 1900 leaving London Waterloo at 11:10, and this continued over the next decade as the North Cornwall & Bude Express with the departure time adjusted to 11:00 running during the summer only. By 1914 this train was running throughout the year, and outside the summer season carried through coaches to Padstow, Bude, Plymouth and Ilfracombe, a presage of things to come. However World War I reduced both the scope for holidays and stretched the railways resources, and after this the L&SWR; did not pursue a policy of having a premier named train on the route. This was set to change as a result of the 1923 Railway Grouping Act which created four new companies to run Britain's railways, and the former London & South Western Railway became part of the new Southern Railway. The Great Western Railway (GWR), as the main competitor for services to Devon and Cornwall, had been left virtually unchanged by the railway company mergers, and the directors of the new Southern Railway recognised that some initiative was needed to publicise their services to the South West, and in addition show they were ready to compete with \\"the old enemy\\" once more; the GWR had coined the phrase Cornish Riviera and had been using this in its publicity for 20 years. John Elliot, a public relations assistant to the Southern Railway, proposed to the board in December 1924 that the next batch of express passenger locomotives be named after characters from Arthurian legend, and that a named train be introduced. The name was chosen as the result of a competition run in the staff magazine and the winning entry was submitted by Mr F. Rowland, a guard from Woking who won a prize of three guineas for suggesting Atlantic Coast Express. He was soon to move to Great Torrington in North Devon; he was killed in a shunting accident there six years later. It made its inaugural run on 19 July 1926. The route From the beginning the ACE effectively had five destinations, three in Devon and two in Cornwall. Plymouth, by far the largest city in Devon, was served via Okehampton and Tavistock. The steep gradients and tortuous nature of the route beyond Exeter meant that it was not possible to compete with the Great Western Railway's Cornish Riviera Express in terms of speed, but it was a useful alternative route, particularly for passengers from the South and South East of England, who could make a connection at Salisbury and thus avoid travelling via London. Halwill Junction was the junction for the two Cornish destinations: Bude, a small but growing resort on the most northerly part of the Cornish coast; and Padstow, a fishing port at the mouth of the River Camel and the Southern Railway's most distant outpost almost 260 miles from Waterloo. At the junction, the Bude carriages were detached and the Padstow section turned south to Launceston, skirting the edge of Bodmin Moor before reaching Camelford. A swift descent to Wadebridge followed, through countryside described by Poet Laureate John Betjeman. The route was completed following the River Camel. The North Devon portions of the ACE followed the route from Exeter Central through Crediton to Yeoford before turning north west and reaching the valley of the River Taw at Lapford. Thereafter the line hugged the river to Barnstaple Junction, the junction for the two North Devon destinations of the ACE. From here the Torrington portion followed the estuary of the Taw westward to Instow before turning south along the River Torridge to Bideford and its destination of Great Torrington. The portion for Ilfracombe, another port that owes its status as a holiday destination to the coming of the railways, continued northwards. Started from Barnstaple Junction, the branch for Ilfracombe headed north through Barnstaple Town and on to Braunton before climbing steeply to Mortehoe and then descending more steeply to the terminus at Ilfracombe. At various times Exmouth, Sidmouth, Seaton Junction and Lyme Regis had through coaches. The service The heavy reliance on holiday passengers meant that the volume of traffic was very seasonal. On Summer Saturdays, the ACE consisted of up to five trains departing from Waterloo in the 40 minutes before 11:00, stretching resources on the long single-track branch lines to the limit. In the winter timetable, one train was sufficient for all of the branches, and stops were made at all but the most insignificant stations west of Exeter. Significant delays were frequent at the junctions, as coaches were detached or attached and shunted between the various sections of the train, belying the name of \\"Express\\". In later years, a carriage was detached at Salisbury to join a following stopping train along the main line, and two carriages were detached at Sidmouth Junction, one for Sidmouth and one for Exmouth via Budleigh Salterton. The restaurant and buffet cars were normally removed during the major division at Exeter Central. Saturdays were always the busiest and in August 1939 the ACE was shown in Bradshaw's Guide as five separate trains departing from Waterloo; serving Ilfracombe (10:36), Padstow (10:40), Ilfracombe again (10:47), Bude (10:54) and a final departure at 11.00 with portions for Padstow, Bude and Plymouth. Services continued in much the same pattern until the outbreak of World War II, which necessitated longer trains and substantial deceleration on all lines, rendering named trains no longer appropriate. The zenith With the end of hostilities the Southern Railway lost no time in reintroducing its most prestigious express. The company's locomotive design department, under its innovative Chief Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid, had been working during the war years; Bulleid's two new designs of express locomotive, the Merchant Navy class Pacifics for services between Waterloo and Exeter Central and the lighter West Country and Battle of Britain class for the branches beyond, enabled improvements in timekeeping and reliability and facilitated the introduction of heavier trains. Initially there was little increase in overall speeds owing to the poor state of the track, which had suffered neglect during the war. The 1950s marked the highpoint of the ACE, with the first mile-a- minute timing on the Southern Region (as the Southern Railway had become) with a 12:23 arrival in Salisbury, 83 miles from Waterloo. Gradual improvements in schedules continued until the final acceleration in autumn of 1961, when the journey time from Waterloo to Exeter Central came down to 2 hours 56 minutes. Terminal decline In common with lines all over the country, the 1960s were a period of steady decline for services to the West Country as car ownership increased. In 1963 control of all lines west of Salisbury was handed over to the Western Region ‚Äì still the hated Great Western Railway to most of the Southern employees ‚Äì and changes to the ACE followed swiftly. From June 1963 the Bude, Torrington and Plymouth through carriages were withdrawn except on summer Saturdays. The remaining services survived through the following summer until, on 5 September 1964 West Country locomotive 34023 Blackmoor Vale hauled the last ACE out of Padstow, and the last coaches of the Atlantic Coast Express arrived there from Waterloo behind N Class locomotive 31845. The radical pruning of the railway system from 1966 by Dr Richard Beeching affected the West Country. Torrington lost its passenger services in 1965, the North Cornwall branches in 1966, the Plymouth line in 1968, and Barnstaple to Ilfracombe in 1970. Revival in the 21st century In 2008 First Great Western revived the name for a new summer only daily service from London Paddington to Newquay operated by High Speed Trains. As at May 2018, this departs London Paddington on Mondays to Fridays at 09:03 and Newquay at 15:06, and on Saturdays departs London Paddington at 11:35 and Newquay at 11:30. First Devon & Cornwall previously ran a regular bus service from Exeter to Bude, via Okehampton and Holsworthy (service X9), which was branded Atlantic Coast Express, with this name appearing on the indicator board of the bus and also on bus stops. The bus had to make a diversion around the back streets of Holsworthy to avoid a low bridge ‚Äì one of the surviving overbridges of the old railway route. The Bluebell Railway operates some of its Mark 1 coaching stock with ACE roofboards. While there is no chance of reopening all the routes of the ACE, some significant sections may soon see the return of passengers. The Bodmin & Wenford Railway plans to extend 5 miles west from Boscarne Junction into Wadebridge in the future (although only the last mile of this will be over the route of the ACE). The Launceston Steam Railway wants to extend its short narrow-gauge line further west along the North Cornwall line as far as Egloskerry, and to provide winter services using a railmotor. The course of the Barnstaple to Bideford route is retained, and there is an active campaign for reopening. The Exeter to Plymouth route beyond Okehampton via Tavistock has been considered for reopening, partly due to population growth in Tavistock, and partly because of coastal erosion of the South Devon Railway sea wall at Dawlish.

The notion stands in contrast to the subject‚Äìobject dynamic prevailing in heterosexual society, where men presume cultural dominance and see only themselves as subjects relative to women, who are in turn treated as objects or property. Hay extrapolated this interpersonal/sexual dynamic into a broader social context, believing that subject‚Äìobject relationships were the root of society's ills. Objectification served as a barrier, emotionally separating an individual self from another individual by dehumanizing them. Same-sex relationships, however, suggest a different dynamic at work. Hay believed that gay relationships evolve from mutual respect and empathy for the other: a longing for a companion who is as equally valuable as the self, an interpersonal/sexual dynamic based on \\"subject‚ÄìSUBJECT\\" consciousness. (Hay capitalized the second term for emphasis in all writings on the topic.) Hay believed that this subject‚ÄìSUBJECT way of viewing the world is the most valuable contribution LGBT people bring to society at large: by empathizing with all people, relating to each other as equal-to-equal, society can change drastically, and social justice can prevail.

Four of the stores include ice cream parlors year-round, with one location offering ice cream seasonally. Albert \\"Mike\\" Malley borrowed $500 in 1935, and opened his first candy store on Madison Avenue in Lakewood. The Malley family lived in the back of the building. Their efforts were successful, and by 1949, they opened a second store, also in Lakewood. In 2010, Malley's moved its corporate headquarters from Cleveland back to Lakewood, Ohio, near where the company was founded in 1935. The reason for the move was to free up more retail space at the company's main plant, where the HQ had been since 1990. Malley‚Äôs manufacturing hub is a 60,000 square-foot factory in Cleveland, noted for three tall pink silos with the words \\"Milk,\\" \\"Sugar,\\" and \\"Cocoa\\" painted on them. The company‚Äôs signature confection, chocolate-covered strawberries, are prepared by a special 50-person crew around Valentine‚Äôs Day every year. In October 2017, the company opened its 23rd retail outlet in Plain Township, OH, a suburb of Canton. This was Malley‚Äôs first venture into Stark County; its closest stores located in nearby Summit County. Malley's has been in business for over seven decades, and has been Cleveland's largest family owned and operated factory since 1935. It is currently a third generation company. Republican National Convention, 2016 The Republican Party, holding its national convention in Cleveland in 2016, named Malley's Chocolates as one of 22 vendors to be included in the RNC \\"Freedom Marketplace\\" to be held at Progressive Field concurrent with the convention in adjacent Quicken Loans Arena. Malley's will offer their signature chocolates with a Cleveland theme. Unique promotions Third generation Malley's president, Dan Malley, is renowned for his unusual promotional events. He has persuaded Cleveland celebrities, such as Natalie Ronayne of the Cleveland Botanical Garden; Beth Mooney, CEO of KeyCorp; and celebrity chef Rocco Whelan to appear in his Malley's catalog wearing fuzzy bunny ears. It is an annual event Malley has also distributed 50,000 \\"Choc\\" Chocolate bumper stickers. If a driver is spotted by one of Malley's team, the driver gets $25 and a chance to win $500. Perhaps the most unusual promotion was when Malley persuaded 25 people to lease and drive pink Volkswagen beetles emblazoned with the Malley's and \\"Choc\\" logos. Malley pays the drivers $150/month and sets up the $300/month lease through a Cleveland car dealer.

History of the Journal The Public-Access Computer Systems Review (PACS Review) was the first open access journal in the field of library and information science. It was established in 1989 by Charles W. Bailey, Jr., who served as Editor-in- Chief from 1989 through 1996. It was published by the University of Houston Libraries. The journal was announced on the PACS-L discussion list on August 16, 1989. A call for papers was issued on October 16, 1989. The publication of the first issue was announced on January 3, 1990. The journal was cataloged on OCLC and assigned an ISSN number () by the Library of Congress National Serials Data Program on February 1, 1990. Initially, the journal published scholarly papers (Communications section), columns, and reviews. Papers in the Communications section were selected by the Editor-in-Chief and the Associate Editor, Communications. A private mailing list was utilized for communication with editorial staff and Editorial Board members. Most communication with authors was done via e-mail, including paper submission. The PACS Review was published three times a year. New issue announcements were distributed as e-mail messages on the PACS-L discussion list, and users retrieved the ASCII article files from the University of Houston's LISTSERV via e-mail. (LISTSERV distribution was suspended in 1999.) Authors retained the copyright to PACS Review articles, and they gave the University of Houston the nonexclusive right to publish the articles in the journal and in future publications. Authors could republish their articles elsewhere, but they agreed to mention prior publication of the articles in the PACS Review within these works. Copying of PACS Review articles was permitted for educational, noncommercial use by academic computer centers, individual scholars, and libraries. On October 29, 1991, the journal adopted a more flexible publication schedule that reduced article publication time. A Refereed Articles section of the journal was announced on November 11, 1991, and a call for papers was issued on February 6, 1992. The Refereed Articles section included papers that were peer reviewed by Editorial Board members using a double-blind review procedure, which was usually conducted via e-mail. The publication of the first refereed paper was announced on April 6, 1992. Between 1992 and 1996, the first five volumes of The Public-Access Computer Systems Review were also published in book form by the Library and Information Technology Association (LITA). Walt Crawford prepared the camera-ready copy for these volumes and Charles W. Bailey, Jr. provided editorial support. Starting on April 6, 1992, PACS Review issue publication announcements were also distributed on the PACS-P list. On January 29, 1994, the distribution of the journal via University of Houston Libraries' Gopher server was announced. (Gopher distribution was suspended in 1998.) The journal ceased publishing reviews in 1994. On March 9, 1995, the distribution of the journal via University of Houston Libraries' Web server was announced. Starting with the first issue of volume six (March 21, 1995), the PACS Review: (1) published articles in both ASCII and HTML formats, (2) offered HTML articles with both internal and external links, and (3) gave authors the option of updating the HTML version of their articles. The first updated article was \\"Network-Based Electronic Publishing of Scholarly Works: A Selective Bibliography\\" by Charles W. Bailey, Jr., which was updated 25 times. At the end of 1996, Mr. Bailey stepped down as Editor-in-Chief. Pat Ensor and Thomas C. Wilson became Editors-in-Chief in January 1997. They edited volumes eight (1997) and nine (1998). Publication of the last issue was announced on June 18, 1998. Papers were under consideration for publication until August 2000, when the journal ceased operation. During its nine years of publication, the PACS Review published 42 issues that included 112 articles, columns, reviews, and editorials. The PACS Review was indexed in Current Index to Journals in Education, Information Science Abstracts, and Library Literature. The journal is archived on the Internet Archive and the Texas Digital Library.  Editorial Staff  = Editors-in- Chief = * Charles W. Bailey, Jr., 1989-1996 * Pat Ensor, 1997-2000 * Thomas C.

Often outwardly seeming to be somewhat disconnected from the world around him, Bruce Bickford's work is extremely subjective in its content and concepts, making for some disturbing and shocking imagery. Much of his video work depicted fast-moving, fluid-like transformations of human figures and disfigured faces into odd beasts on surreal structural settings with impressive camera effects (moving around within his stop-motion animation). His life and work were featured in the 2004 biographical documentary film Monster Road, directed by Brett Ingram. In 2006, he was working on Boar's Head/Whore's Bed (line animation, 4,500+ frames and counting), Tales of the Green River and Castle 2001, a feature-length film which is animated using 3D shapes made out of bits of paper.

It originated as a separate village, retains a High Street with a parish church and shops, and is still thought of as a village by many of its 6,867 inhabitants.1991 census data; 2001 data not readily separable from Avonmouth. Although on the far northwest corner, and largely separated from the rest of Bristol by a broad swathe of parkland extending from the Blaise Castle estate, with the River Avon forming a barrier for access to Somerset, the community is still a convenient location from which to reach all parts of the city and its work environment. Travel is also easy from Shirehampton into Gloucestershire, South Wales and Somerset since it lies within easy reach of all the main motorways in the area, including the M5, the M4 Second Severn Crossing, and the M49, and it is served by the A4 Portway and by Shirehampton railway station, which allow access to near the city centre. It is informally known to local people as \\"Shire\\". Situation Shirehampton looks across the Avon towards the rural Failand Hills of Somerset. For many centuries the only direct connection with Somerset was via a small rowed ferry which crossed from near The Lamplighters pub (\\"The Lamps\\") to the village of Pill, Somerset opposite. This state of affairs continued until the completion of the M5 Avonmouth Bridge in 1974. From the limestone ridge of Penpole Point (whose name meant approximately Land's End in the Celtic language spoken here before English), there used to be extensive and far-reaching views across the River Severn to the distant hills of South Wales, but tree growth has restricted this once spectacular prospect. Prehistory The gravel terraces above the River Avon provide some of the earliest evidence of human occupation in the British Isles. Here and around Ham Green and Pill, on the opposite bank of the Avon, humans with a Lower Palaeolithic (earliest phase of the Old Stone Age) culture (possibly of the hominid type Homo heidelbergensis) left tools and debris behind at an uncertain time some 250‚Äì400,000 years ago.Bates 2003 , replaced by Bates and Wenban-Smith 2005 ; HTML version of former still accessible For comparison, the well-known Palaeolithic sites at Waverley Wood, Warwickshire, and Boxgrove Quarry, Sussex, have artefacts from about 500,000 years ago, and Boxgrove has yielded bones of H. heidelbergensis. History Shirehampton was originally a detached part of the parish of Westbury-on-Trym, separated from the main part of Westbury by a part of Henbury parish, which included Kingsweston, the great house, King's Weston House whose inhabitants have had a considerable impact on Shirehampton as employers and benefactors. The area is on record as part of the estate of \\"Stoke\\", which was granted by King Offa of Mercia to the bishop of Worcester in about 795, along with the district that is now called Stoke Bishop, and there are two later Anglo-Saxon documents about the same pieces of land.Sawyer 1968, documents 139/146, 1187, 1433.Higgins 2004. The place was originally called simply Hampton, meaning \\"large farming estate\\" or \\"farm enclosed on several sides\\", and later became known as \\"sharny Hampton\\", meaning \\"dungy Hampton\\". The name was \\"cleaned up\\" by the Elizabethans to its current form.Smith 1964. The village grew up around the lowest safe river crossing on the river Avon before it empties into the Severn. The ferry between the villages of Pill, Somerset, and Shirehampton, originally in Gloucestershire, connects a ridgeway along Kingsweston Hill (sometimes now called Abbot's Way) with the hills beyond the Avon and continues on towards Clevedon. The ferry ran continuously until 1974, when it was superseded by the M5 bridge. A priory of the Benedictine abbey of St Mary, Cormeilles, in Normandy, is sometimes said to have been established at Shirehampton in the early Middle Ages, and the converted fifteenth-century tithe barn in the High Street is believed to have belonged to the monastic estate. However, the place referred to in Domesday Book is certain to have been Kyre in Worcestershire, and there is no real connection between Shirehampton and Cormeilles apart from the building stones exchanged by the two communities in 1963 on the strength of the supposed historical connection. The development of Shirehampton throughout the eighteenth century is closely associated with the history of the adjacent King's Weston House and its extensive estate. Much of the surrounding area was in the ownership of the Southwell family, owners of King's Weston and later to receive the title of Baron de Clifford. Shirehampton prospered through tourism as sightseers from Bath, Clifton and Bristol's Hotwells came to view Kings Weston and the famous views from Penpole Point. Shirehampton became ecclesiastically separate in 1844 when the chapel of ease of St Mary, dating from at least Elizabethan times, was raised to parish church status. The original chapel building, about which nothing is known, had been replaced in 1727 and this had been rebuilt in 1827. This Gothic-style building burnt down in 1928 and was replaced by the current church, designed by Percival Hartland Thomas, which has a distinctive electric carillon installed in 1959 with the aid of a benefaction from parishioner Mabel Creber.Thomas 1993, pp. 108‚Äì35. There are three other churches in Shirehampton: Methodist, Baptist, and Roman Catholic. During World War I, Shirehampton was the location of a remount depot for horses. This was the largest such depot in the country, with a capacity of up to 5,000 horses. These horses were mostly supplied from the US and Shirehampton was conveniently close to the new Royal Edward Dock at Avonmouth where they were landed. After some weeks of training, horses would then pass to the depot at Swaythling, from where they passed to France. 347,045 horses and mules passed through Shirehampton in the course of the war. After the war much of the materiel from the remount depot was bought by local builder Robert Stride who used it to develop Severn Beach.Coates.R - 'Giant Strides' http://www.shire.org.uk/content/history/strides/strides.php Robert was the cousin of Jared and Jethro Stride who developed Sneyd Park.A Family Business - Bristol Evening Post 19/5/2008 p.24 Avonmouth Avonmouth was a part of Shirehampton parish until 1917. It developed as the main element of the port of Bristol in the later nineteenth century, attracting many workers to settle there and in Shirehampton proper; it had grown so big by 1917 that it was given separate status, for both ecclesiastical and civil purposes. Shirehampton itself expanded considerably in the later nineteenth century, and was absorbed, with Avonmouth, by the city of Bristol in 1904. After World War I, the city built a great deal of decent social (\\"council\\") housing here, and this has largely determined the present character of the place. Along the High Street there remains a fair sprinkling of the larger houses which typified the place before 1900, often (like Twyford House and The Wylands) converted to public or commercial use; some have been demolished and replaced by small infill estates (like Sunny Hill); some have been retained and surrounded by other houses (such as Penlea and the former vicarage partly retaining some of the supposed priory's construction); and some have gone altogether like the ancient house of sixteenth-century appearance, which has been lost to road widening and a row of 1960s shops. Benefactions As Shirehampton and Avonmouth grew, the squires of Kings Weston House, notably Philip Napier Miles (1865‚Äì1935), gave many benefactions to the district, including land for churches, war memorials and social amenities. Among these important gifts was the Public Hall of 1904,Helme 2004. whose main claim to fame is perhaps that it was the venue of the first performance of Vaughan Williams's rhapsody The Lark Ascending, in its original version for solo violin and piano, played by the violinst Marie Hall, a friend of Vaughan Williams from his visits to Kings Weston house, in 1920. Little Park (or Shirehampton Park) was given to the National Trust after World War I, and is used as a golf course. Amenities Shirehampton is well provided with churches, schools, sporting facilities, shops and pubs. It has a number of public open spaces and antiquities nearby. These include Kingsweston Roman Villa (whose ruins are visible by the roadside in the modern suburb of Lawrence Weston), Blaise Castle Estate, and Blaise Castle House Museum, in addition to Shirehampton Park. Shirehampton Football Club, based at Penpole Lane,Shirehampton FC in Shirehampton and play in the Somerset County League. Other antiquities The Old Powder House On the banks of the River Avon stands the Old Powder House. It was built in 1775-6 to store gunpowder, which was not allowed into Bristol docks. It is a grade II listed building. The village war memorial stands by Shirehampton Road north of the golf course, not far from the site of the now dry Rush Pool, a pool formerly used by drovers bringing cattle from Wales across the Severn to market in Bristol. Ecology Shirehampton, in particular the woodland overlooking Horseshoe Bend in the Avon (a National Nature Reserve), is well known as being the main location for certain rare plant species including the true service tree (Sorbus domestica) and two other whitebeams, Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica. The nationally scarce large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, as it does elsewhere in the Severn basin, and rare herbaceous plants include field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The narrow saltmarsh below the wood contains two nationally scarce vascular plant species, slender hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and long-stalked orache (Atriplex longipes). The Lamplighters Marsh Site of Nature Conservation Interest is also within the boundaries of Shirehampton.

He was an extremely productive scholar with many significant publications. *Philip Napier Miles (1865‚Äì1935), composer of music and philanthropist, lived all his life at Kingsweston House and owned much of the land on which Shirehampton and Avonmouth are built. *Gilbert Jessop (1874‚Äì1955), cricketer and later in his life a writer, lived on The Green, Shirehampton, from 1909‚Äì13. *Rotha Mary Clay (1878‚Äì1961), social worker and medieval historian, lived and worked much of her life in Shirehampton, living at Ilex Cottage, High Street. *Irene Base (1897-1982) Calligrapher & Illuminator of International repute. Some works are still held in St Mary's Parish Church e.g. Illuminated Address for Nurse Catherine Court. Was featured in the International 'Who's Who'. She lived at the now demolished Elizabethan House in the High Street, but for most of her life in Station Road. *Harry Jones (writing as Hal Jons and as Harry Graham, 1912-1983), novelist, moved to Shirehampton in the early 1950s. He wrote westerns along with a Second World War adventure and a book based partly on his experiences in a South Wales mining village in the 1920s. Almost twenty books were published between 1960 and his death, in Shirehampton, in 1983. All of Hal Jons'/Harry Graham's published works have recently been republished as both print books and ebooks by Burnham Priory Publications (so named because all of the books were written in either Priory Road or Burnham Road, Shirehampton). *Ethel Thomas (1925‚Äì2008), local historian, moved with her parents to Shirehampton in 1937, and to Avonmouth in 1952 when she married. She wrote five books on the history of Shirehampton and Avonmouth. See the sources section below. *Sir Robert Stephens (1931‚Äì1995), a leading English actor in the early years of Britain's Royal National Theatre was born in Shirehampton. He was one of the most respected actors of his generation and was at one time regarded as the natural successor to Laurence Olivier. *Elizabeth Kelly (Liz Tilberis) (1947‚Äì99), successively editor-in-chief of British Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, is said by most sources to have been born in Shirehampton. The novelist Evelyn Waugh (1903‚Äì66) is known to have visited both Shirehampton, where his mother had lived, and Kingsweston House in the 1950s, whilst researching his autobiography, but his memory seems to have been confused. He wrote of his visit in a postcard to a friend, Francis Beaufort Palmer. Waugh's mother lived at Priory House, 61 Pembroke Road. In his book A Little Learning, Waugh writes: In less than ten years from the book's publication in 1964, Priory House and the new vicarage had been demolished, but The Priory is still there. Trivia In the 1960s and 1970s a Dalek sat outside the Haven Master's building on the banks of the river Avon, just across from the Lamplighters public house. The Dalek used to face up river, so that boats coming from Bristol Docks to the Severn and Bristol Channel (not to mention the Pill Ferry) would have to pass under its nozzle. The Dalek was used to raise funds during at least one Shirehampton Carnival in (probably) the very late 1960s. For 6d, children could sit inside on the plain wooden slat and twiddle the nozzle for a few minutes apiece. Both the Dalek and the Pill Ferry (as well as 'The Cockle Lady', who used to sell cockles in the High Street during the 1960s) are featured in the not-quite-children's book, Tabitha Miggins: Ship's Cat (on the Pill Ferry), by Shirehampton author, Mark Jones (writing as Philippa Perry). Note that the photograph on the rear jacket of the follow-up book, Further Adventures of Tabitha Miggins, Ship's Cat on the Pill Ferry (this time attributed to Mark Clinton Jones), shows a painted-out direction post in Pill that points the way to the \\"Shirehampton Ferry\\". Preview. This is a bit of a misnomer because it was known as 'the Pill ferry' on both sides of the river.

The station has an effective radiated power of 250 watts. The broadcast signal is also streamed live on the internet. Most of its members are students at the University of New Brunswick and St. Thomas University, however, it has many non-student volunteers.CRTC renewal 2015 https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2014/2014-295.htm Its broadcast studio and record library are located in the Student Union Building (the SUB) which is shared by the two institutions. History The organization now known as CHSR was founded in the late 1950s, and officially went on-air January 22, 1961 as Radio UNB. It is one of the oldest community radio stations in Atlantic Canada and boasts the largest music library east of Montreal, although Fredericton is much smaller than other communities in the Atlantic Region. The library holds a large variety of musical genres, on a variety of formats (vinyl, cassettes, compact discs, etc.) from the past six decades. Like many student media organizations, the relationship with various university, student and community leaders were occasionally strained. One of the more persistent sources of disputes was largely resolved with an agreement signed in 1999, which stabilized CHSR's largest source of funding: undergraduate students at the University of New Brunswick. The new agreement requires a signed petition and a referendum to change or remove the media fee, whereas previously funding could be (and once was) removed by a simple motion of Student Union Council. As a community radio station housed on a university campus, CHSR makes an extra effort to reach out to the off-campus community, playing local content and providing on-site training for new DJs who later are able to host their own show. A founding member of the national community broadcasters collective, the National Campus and Community Radio Association, CHSR remains an active member of the alternative media, including participation in the NCRA's Dig Your Roots project. CHSR is also a voting member of the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters and the Grassroots Radio Coalition.

This episode marks the final appearance of Loretta, until the season 7 episode, \\"Love, Blactually\\". In the episode, Cleveland's wife Loretta cheats on him with Quagmire, due to Cleveland's \\"lack of passion\\" and \\"not being a real man\\". With Cleveland separating from Loretta, this episode lays much of the foundation for The Cleveland Show. The episode features guest performances from Jane Carr, Randy Crenshaw, Miriam Flynn, Denis Martell, Mark Peredes and Fred Tatasciore, as well as several recurring guest performers for the series. Plot Peter invites his friends on his fishing boat for a party at sea. While Quagmire is fishing, he catches a fish that lands in Loretta's shirt. She invites him to reach in and grab it, which after a moment of hesitation he does. While Quagmire's hand is between her breasts, Cleveland approaches and mentions the snacks Peter has supplied, serenely saying hello to Quagmire before walking away. When partaking in charades with his friends, Joe falls overboard and nearly drowns, but is saved and revived by CPR. The Griffins take a CPR class and Peter receives a card for it, but when he harasses a man in a harmless car crash under the pretenses of CPR, his card is revoked and he confides in his disappointment with Brian. Upon hearing Loretta scream at her house, Peter and Brian quickly check and see her having sex on the couch with another man which they do not realize is Quagmire, as they only see the back of his body with a tattoo of a phone number on his buttocks. They initially decide not to tell anyone about Loretta's adultery but do so after literally doing everything in the world, which makes Quagmire nervous and afraid that Cleveland would find out. Peter then tells Cleveland at the Drunken Clam what he and Brian saw in an obnoxious manner, but Cleveland seems indifferent. When he confronts Loretta about it, she states it was because she needed passion and that he \\"wasn't acting like a real man\\". Cleveland apologizes for his actions, but Loretta sees him as pathetic for doing so and kicks him out of their house. As Cleveland is staying over at the Griffin house, Peter and Brian visit Quagmire for help on finding the man who slept with Loretta, but realize that it was him after seeing the same tattoo from before. Despite the two telling Cleveland who it was exactly, he remains indifferent by the revelation. Lois tells Cleveland that Loretta wants him to express his feelings: that women sometimes want men to be strong and stand up for them. Peter then tries to get his friend to feel some passion by taking him to a wrestling match featuring Randy Savage, but it affects Peter much more than Cleveland. He then puts on a Quagmire mask and wrestles with Brian (who is unwillingly wearing a Loretta mask) on the ground. This method finally yields results: Cleveland becomes enraged and vows to kill Quagmire. Peter realizes that his plan has worked too well and tries to protect Quagmire by hiding him at Mayor West's mansion. West's lunacy soon proves too much even for Quagmire and he returns home and calls Cleveland to apologize. Cleveland appears and chases Quagmire around his house wielding a baseball bat. Despite finally having Quagmire cowering and at his mercy, Cleveland realizes that he is unable to hurt another living person, no matter how badly they have hurt him and Quagmire apologizes to Cleveland for sleeping with Loretta. After Peter brings Loretta over, she and Cleveland end their marriage via a divorce, with the latter believing that he deserves better. Sometime afterwards at Quagmire's place, he and Cleveland decide to repair their broken friendship through a friendly sparring match in boxing. Production Mike Henry wrote the episode, along with his brother, Patrick. This episode was written by Mike Henry and his brother, Patrick Henry, and directed by former Futurama director James Purdum during the course of the fourth production season. According to the DVD commentary for this episode, Loretta was written out of Family Guy because her voice actor, Alex Borstein (who also voices Lois and other female characters), was apparently tired of voicing Loretta. However, Loretta would later appear one last time in Season 7's \\"Love, Blactually\\" before being killed off. In addition to the regular cast, actress Jane Carr, actor Randy Crenshaw, actress Miriam Flynn, professional chef Emeril Lagasse, voice actor Denis Martell, voice actor Mark Peredes and voice actor Fred Tatasciore guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Ralph Garman, writer David A. Goodman, writer Danny Smith, actress Jennifer Tilly, and writer John Viener made minor performances in the episode. Recurring guest cast members Mike Henry, Patrick Warburton, and Adam West also appeared in the episode, portraying the characters of Cleveland Brown, Joe Swanson, and Mayor West respectively. Cultural references * Peter sings the song \\"Rock Lobster\\" by The B-52's to Cleveland in this episode. * While the adults play charades on the ship, Joe does the death of Natalie Wood. * A cutaway shows Peter repainting the famous Sistine Chapel, with a portrait of actor/wrestler Andr√© the Giant, a reference to the Andre the Giant Has a Posse street art campaign. He explains that this \\"would be a little hipper...[to] bring back...those boys you scared away,\\" a reference to the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal. * While at the CPR teaching session, Peter says the CPR dummy is ‚Äúhard, jagged and tastes like alcohol; Just like kissing Faye Dunaway‚Äù * When Brian hears Loretta screaming, Peter seems to fail to understand what has happened. Brian tries to explain that it sounded like someone was screaming, to which Peter replies with \\"Trouble at the old mill?\\" This is a reference to Lassie and the innumerable dangers to which Lassie alerted people. * Quagmire's \\"My Fellow Americans\\" cutaway is a reference to the Lewinsky scandal, which involved Bill Clinton having sexual relations with his intern. Quagmire resembles President Clinton during that scene. * The transition scene from Peter's house to Quagmire's house when Peter decides to talk to him about a revenge lay is a parody of the transition scenes from the original Transformers cartoon series, with the Autobot and Decepticon symbols being replaced with Peter and Quagmire's faces. * The scene where Cleveland finally learns to get angry at Loretta's infidelity causes him to pull out a can of spinach, squeezing the contents out and swallowing it, then blowing steam out of his ears. This is a direct reference to the old Popeye cartoon shorts; the theme song for the spinach- eating sequences is also used. * During the scene where Cleveland and Stewie are watching Bewitched on television the line 'Power of Christ' is mentioned. This is a reference to the 1973 horror film The Exorcist in which the line is repeated by Father Merrin and Father Karras during the famous Exorcism scene. * When Peter wants to quickly move out, he screams \\"to the Petercopter\\" and steps into a helicopter that reminds of Budgie the Little Helicopter. Later a similar scene happens in which Peter wants to move out, while screaming \\"to the Hindenpeter\\", referring to the Hindenburg airship. As soon as the zeppelin moves out of view, it crashes with a big explosion into Joe's house, referring to the Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937. * In a cutaway, Quagmire and Cleveland imitate the Festrunk brothers, the ‚Äútwo wild and crazy guys‚Äù from the 1970s Saturday Night Live episodes. Peter appears dressed as Beldar from the Coneheads, another of Aykroyd's SNL characters from that era. * Palpatine, from Star Wars, urges Cleveland to ‚Äúlet the hatred flow through‚Äù him, which he says to Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi. Lois then proceeds to push him out of the frame. * This episode has three references to the Rocky film series. The first is when Cleveland is doing pull-ups in the front doorway of the Griffin home, and trainer Mickey Goldmill appears and exclaims, \\"He's a wreckin' machine!!\\" The second is at the end when Cleveland and Quagmire are starting a friendly boxing match. The third is the song \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" by Survivor, which plays just before the closing credits.http://www.tv.com/family-guy/the-cleveland-loretta- quagmire/episode/365974/trivia.html - archive: Reception With Fox in second place among adults 18 to 49 years old, this episode gained a total of 8.35 million viewers. Kim Voynar of TV Squad wrote a favorable review, saying \\"This episode of Family Guy was just chock-full of the tasteless and tacky moments that make the show so popular.\\" The \\"You Have AIDS\\" sequence, in which Peter and a barbershop quartet dance, in musical revue fashion, around the bed of a man with end-stage AIDS, delivering the patient's diagnosis in song, drew protests from several AIDS service organizations.

Los Angeles Street. It replaced buildings of the city‚Äôs Los Angeles Central Business District (1880‚Äì1899)19th-century downtown. The site is to become the new ‚ÄúLos Angeles Street Civic Building‚Äù (LASCB), part of a larger project to diversify, revitalize and reconnect the district. https://civiccenterprojects.lacity.org/sites/default/files/CCD%20191119%20Community%20Mtg%20%234%20Presentation_sm.pdf Often called \\"The Glass House\\", the building was named for former LAPD chief William H. Parker. Originally called the Police Administration Building (PAB) (or Police Facilities Building), groundbreaking for the center began on December 30, 1952, and construction was completed in 1955. The architect was Welton Becket and Associates and J.E. Stanton, associated architect. Maynard Woodard was director of design and Francis Runcy was the project architect. The eight-story building was of reinforced concrete with aluminum sash windows covered by louvers. Ceramic tile by Gladding, McBean covered the west elevation. The building combined police facilities that had been located throughout the Civic Center area. The new building was called \\"Ultramodern in all respects\\" and \\"The Jail that Modern Science Built\\" by Popular Mechanics in 1956. The jail area was built without window bars, utilizing nonbreakable tempered glass, and Neoprene floors to reduce self-injuries. A special control board in the lineup room could simulate different lighting conditions and a wire screen that acted like a one-way mirror. The Statistical Unit was the first police department to install IBM computer equipment. The laboratories of the Scientific Investigation Division took up the entire 4th floor and included early versions of a breath-based alcohol impairment test. Two prominent artworks were commissioned for the building, a large bronze modernist sculpture by Bernard Rosenthal mounted at the entrance titled \\"The American Family,\\" and a mosaic work in the lobby depicting architectural landmarks of Los Angeles by Joseph Young. The mural, mounted a few feet off the ground, was 6' high and 36' long, was Young's first public work. American Artist magazine called it ‚ÄúSix tons of steel, copper, aluminum and glass, fused into a monolithic mosaic panel of beauty and permanence that seems to float on air.‚Äù Both artworks were removed by the Los Angeles Police Department in 2018. The location was previously home to the Olympic Hotel. On July 16, 1966, Parker suffered a fatal heart attack. Soon afterward, the Los Angeles City Council renamed the building \\"Parker Center\\". The building was one of the sites of unrest during the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed a not-guilty verdict for the four police officers involved in the Rodney King incident. New headquarters With time, the Parker Center became outdated and was in need of expensive seismic retrofits. After considering a number of downtown sites for a new facility, the city council selected a property directly south of City Hall, Caltrans' former Los Angeles headquarters. Ground was broken for the new building in January 2007, which was dedicated on October 24, 2009. Both the Old Parker Center and the new headquarters have heliports. The Old Parker Center heliport is marked with a number \\"5\\", while the new center is inscribed with an \\"H\\". The LAPD Robbery and Homicide Division still operated from an annex of the Old Parker Center. On January 15, 2013, the City of Los Angeles permanently closed Parker Center. In 2014 the City Department of Public Works and the Bureau of Engineering recommended razing the now vacant Parker Center in favor of building a 27-story tower in its place. The razing would proceed on a floor-by-floor process, eliminating the need for wrecking balls or dynamiting. Construction of the new building would start in 2016 and last 18‚Äì24 months, with completion anticipated in 2018. 2015 efforts to save Parker Center On January 29, 2015, a city panel, The Cultural Heritage Commission, nominated Parker Center for historical status. A tentative date for the ruling was set for April 28, 2015. However, the ruling was postponed until May 5, 2015. During the council meeting held on May 5, 2015, the council claimed to have \\"lost jurisdiction over this item\\" due to a technical error and did not act in time (within a 105-day time limit). Committee chairman and 14th District Councilman Jos√© Huizar also presented a new motion, recommending against the razing of the building, instead preserving it and \\"build[ing] an adjacent tower taller than the one analyzed in the project's already complete environmental impact report\\". Following these developments, a group of civic leaders and land-use experts convened in May 2015 to discuss the future of Parker Center. They considered whether the former City of LA police headquarters should be preserved, with some of the panel members suggesting that parts of the Parker Center could be preserved while other sections could be razed. In August 2015, it was reported that the discussions regarding the Parker Center had expanded and now revolved not just the future of the building itself, but also what should be done with surrounding areas and the district on a whole. This suggested the possibility of an alternative location for the proposed office space buildings intended to be erected on the plot currently inhabited by the Parker Center. Three options were considered for the Parker Center. # Updating the 319,000-square-foot edifice with improvements including seismic retrofitting and expanding the parking garage to provide another 137 spaces. # Rehabbing some of the building while tearing down the dilapidated Parker Center jail while creating more than 522,000 square feet of usable space. # Razing the building and replacing it with either one or two office structures with a total of about 750,000 square feet of space and 1,173 parking spaces. Demolition In August 2016, the Parker Center building was threatened by demolition once again. A report from the Bureau of Engineering revealed a proposal to build a new municipal office building on the existing site of Parker Center. Given the threat of demolition, the Cultural Heritage Commission quickly mobilized another attempt the following month to award the Parker Center with a landmark status, after having failed to meet the deadline to do so during the preceding year. However, in December 2016 the city Bureau of Engineering once again recommended razing the building, saying that tearing down the structure and creating the new high-rise would cost $514 million. The city Bureau of Engineering claimed that the preservation and smaller new edifice option would cost $621 million (both plans would have roughly the same amount of office space). The city Bureau of Engineering's timetable suggested securing approvals by February 2017. The Los Angeles City Council, on March 24, 2017, voted unanimously to approve a proposal to demolish Parker Center, and replace it with an office tower that would consolidate offices of city employees. The above ground demolition of Parker Center was completed on July 15, 2019. In popular culture Parker Center appears in many episodes of the television drama Dragnet, beginning with the fifth season in 1955. It also appears in several establishing shots for the Perry Mason TV series between 1958 and 1966. It appeared in several episodes (seasons 3, 4 & 10) of Columbo. The NBC drama Hunter also used the Parker Center in the sixth and seventh seasons. Parker Center is also the location of the Priority Homicide Division, and later, Major Crimes on the television series The Closer. The building is also featured as one of the main locations in Police Quest: Open Season, the fourth installment of the Police Quest series, a 1993 PC video game by Sierra Entertainment. Parker Center was also featured in the 1970-set 2014 film Inherent Vice. Parker Center is often mentioned in the novels of the Harry Bosch series written by Michael Connelly and the Shane Scully series written by Stephen J. Cannell. Parker Center and its closure is also mentioned in the Joseph Wambaugh novel Hollywood Hills. Parker Center also appears in the 1983 movie Blue Thunder.

The village is about west of Yate and about northeast of the centre of Bristol. The B4058 road used to pass through the village but now by-passes it just to the north. The \\"iron\\" part of the toponym originates from the iron that used to be mined near the village. \\"Acton\\" is derived from the Old English for \\"farm (or village)Blair, 1977, pages 258‚Äì259 with oak trees\\". Still today there is an oak wood in the village beside the River Frome. The civil parish also includes the smaller villages of Latteridge and Engine Common. Manor The manor of Iron Acton was held by the de Acton family, which took its name from the manor, and which expired in the male line on the death of John IV de Acton in 1362. His heir to Iron Acton became the descendant of his aunt Matilda (or Maud) de Acton, wife of Nicholas Poyntz (d.1311),Maclean, 1885, p.131 feudal baron of Curry Mallet in Somerset. His descendants remained seated at Iron Acton for many generations and rose to prominence under the Tudor monarchs. Sir Nicholas Poyntz (1510-1556) was a prominent courtier during the latter part of the reign of King Henry VIII (1509-1547). His portrait drawing by Hans Holbein the Younger survives in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. He added the east wing to the moated manor house of Acton Court, which addition was lavishly decorated to impress King Henry VIII, who with his second wife, Anne Boleyn, visited the house in 1535 during a tour of the West Country. Sir Robert Poyntz (d.1666), KB, MP for Gloucestershire and High Sheriff of Gloucestershire was the last in the male line of Poyntz of Iron Acton. He left no male progeny, only two daughters and co-heiresses, Grissel Poyntz and Margareta Poyntz. Acton Court Acton Court on Latteridge Lane is the historic manor house of the manor of Iron Acton. It is a Tudor building, with later restorations. In the 16th century Nicholas Poyntz added the east wing to the existing moated house, which addition was lavishly decorated to impress King Henry VIII, who with his second wife, Anne Boleyn, visited the house in 1535 during a tour of the West Country. Historic estates *Algars Court or Algars Manor, just south of the village, is also a Tudor house.Verey, 1970, page 278 Parish church St James the Less St James the Less. The preaching cross, of which then only the base survived, erected by Sir Robert Poyntz, is shown in the churchyard, centre The Church of England parish church of Saint James the Less is Perpendicular Gothic and includes a clerestory, south aisle and south chapel, two-storey north porch and three-stage bell-tower.Verey, 1970, page 276 The nave and south arcade are of three bays. The nave, chancel and south chapel all have wagon roofs and there is a fan vault under the tower. The church was restored in 1878‚Äì79 under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect Sir T. G. Jackson. The high altar has a reredos designed by F. C. Eden and made in about 1930. Behind the altar of the south chapel is a screen also designed by Eden. =Poyntz Chapel= Arms of Poyntz: Quarterly 1st & 4th, barry of eight or and gules (Poyntz); 2nd & 3rd, quarterly per fess indented argent and azure (Acton). The escutcheon, suspended by the guige strap from an initial letter \\"T\\", is shown on a field of oak leaves, a reference to the etymology of the ancient settlement of Acton (\\"Oak-town\\") View eastwards along the south aisle towards the Poyntz Chapel. High on the east wall to the right of the window can be seen hanging the funeral helm with spur and piece of leather surcoat borne on the funeral bier of Sir John Poyntz(d.1680)Text quoted from framed notice in church The altar at the east end of the south aisle forms the focal point of the so-called Poyntz Chapel, which is not a separate chamber or structure. This is not to be confused with the Poyntz Chapel (formally termed \\"Chapel of Jesus\\") built by Sir Robert Poyntz (d.1520) within The Gaunt's Chapel, Bristol. Against the south wall is a 16th-century canopied tomb erected for a now unknown member of the Poyntz family. Of the three heraldic escutcheons comprised within the structure two are now blank and one bears the arms of the Acton family, from which the Poyntz's inherited the manor, A fess indented. No inscription survives. The tomb was covered with many layers of whitewash until this was removed in the 19th-century restoration. Dividing the Poyntz Chapel from the chancel are a pair of stone effigies set on slabs at floor level. The figures show an armed knight of the 14th century beside a female figure, possibly his lady, but perhaps of a slightly later date. The knight is believed to represent Sir John Poyntz (d. 21 Sept 1376), son of Sir Nicholas Poyntz (d. 12 July 1311) feudal baron of Curry Mallet,Known by ancient spelling \\"Cory Mallett\\" in most genealogies of the Poyntz family Somerset, by Matilda Acton, his 2nd wife, daughter and eventual heiress of Sir John Acton (d.1312) of Iron Acton.Church booklet \\"Iron Acton\\", no author or date stated, dedicated to Mrs Eileen Meredith (d.1978), pp.3‚Äì4Heraldic Visitation of Gloucestershire 1623, pp.130‚Äì135, pedigree of Poyntz Buried beneath an incised slab set into the floor in the centre of the Poyntz Chapel is Robert Poyntz (1359‚Äì1439) between his two wives, 1st, Ann (family unknown), 2nd (marr. pre. 1389) Katherine FitzNichol, daughter of Sir Thomas FitzNichol of Hill, Gloucestershire, many times MP for Gloucestershire.

The LMS closed the station in 1944 and it was demolished in the 1960s, but the line still carries one freight train per week between a stone quarry at Tytherington and the junction at Yate with the Birmingham and Gloucester line. A freight-only branch serving an iron mine in Frampton Cotterell joined the branch line at the station. This was closed in 1872 but a truncated section of the line served as a coal depot until closure on 10 June 1963. Iron Acton station had a single platform and a large wooden station building. The remains of the platform survive, as does a crossing- keeper's cottage to the south of the station site. Amenities Iron Acton hosts events throughout the year, including the annual May Day fair and horticultural show. Other events are organised by Acton Aid, a community organisation made up of men of the village who work together to benefit the parish of Iron Acton. Money is raised by holding social events such as the annual fireworks display and the Proms in the Meadows, and working with other parish organisations at the annual May Day fair. An example of such an event is the Victorian evening, during which local residents dressed up in Victorian era clothing for a fair on the street, which is accompanied by a brass band. The village has its own football club, which played home games on the field behind the Rose and Crown public house on the High Street. The pub was closed and was turned into residential accommodation; Iron Acton F.C. now plays home games on Yate Common, Sunnyside Lane, Yate, away. There are two pubs in the village and there is no shop in the main part of the village, there is however a garage on the outskirts of the village that is open 24/7 {  Iron Acton Primary School (above the orange wires), seen from the tower of the church  Looking east along the High Street, seen from tower of the church } Bibliography * Maclean, Sir John, Historical and Genealogical Memoir of the Family of Poyntz (Exeter, 1885) * The Topographer, volume 5, issue 1 (March 1821), edited by Stebbing Shaw, Oxfordshire Visitation, pp. 45‚Äì8, pedigree and heraldry of Poyntz Sources  Thompson, H.L., The Poyntz Family, Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, 1879‚Äì80, Vol. 4, pp.73‚Äì85 References External links *IronActonParish.info *Acton Court *Iron Acton Primary School * www.tudorplace.com Poyntz pedigree Category:Villages in South Gloucestershire District Category:Civil parishes in Gloucestershire ","title":"Iron Acton"},{"id":"2070271","text":"Dragnet may refer to: * Dragnet, a fishing net used in seine fishing * Dragnet (policing), a coordinated search, named for the fishing net Media * Dragnet (franchise) ** Dragnet (radio series), a 1949‚Äì1957 American radio series starring Jack Webb ** Dragnet (1951 TV series), the 1951‚Äì1959 American television spinoff from the radio series ** Dragnet (1954 film), a film version of the television and radio series starring and directed by Jack Webb ** Dragnet (1967 TV series), the 1967‚Äì1970 revival of the original television series ** Dragnet (1987 film), a parody of the television series starring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks ** Dragnet, also known as The New Dragnet, see Dragnet (franchise)#1989 series: The New Dragnet ** Dragnet (2003 TV series), also known as L.A.

Acharya was born to a Brahmin family and received education at home from his grandfather. His father Dhananjaya Acharya was a government official and was eldest of all brothers. Education Bhanubhakta received his education of Sanskrit at his home by his grandfather and later in Varanasi. Career and writing He is honoured with the title of Aadikavi (‡§Ü‡§¶‡§ø‡§ï‡§µ‡§ø)for the contributions he made in the field of poetry and Nepali literature and for specially translating Sanskrit Ramayana in simple nepali language which became popular among laymen. Every year, his birthday is celebrated as Bhanu Jayanti(13 July) when various literacy programs are organized to him. A Statue of Bhanubhakta Acharya at Chowrasta, Darjeeling South Asian languages including the Nepali language were limited mostly to an oral medium of language dissemination at the time with little written context and literary influence. As most of the written texts of South Asia were dominated by Sanskrit, it was mostly inaccessible to the general populace. As the Brahmins were the caste who excelled as teachers, scholars and priests, the access to all of the religious scriptures and other literary works was only limited to them and few who also could receive education and understand Sanskrit. Many poets had written poems in Sanskrit while Acharya started to write in the Nepali language which not only popularized the language but also gained him acceptance from the Rana Rulers. Acharya's benevolence towards Ram‚Äôs heroic exploits brought in him an urgency to make his tale accessible to the people who spoke Nepali. Since most of the people did not understand the Sanskrit language, he translated the epic into the Nepali language. Preserving the lyrical narration style of Ramayana his translations are believed by scholars to carry the same lyrical essence \\"Bhava and Marma\\" that rather than sounding like a poem sounded more like a song without distorting the regional influence or the inner meaning of the Ramayana. He did not receive any western education nor was familiar to foreign literature which kept his work and experiential journey original to the vernacular literary system and brought strong Nepali flavour to his works. The key features of his writings were simple yet strong with a sense of religion, sense of simplicity and the warmth of his country that not many of other poets had been able to be compared to. Belonging to a wealthy family, he never had any financial trouble and had an unremarkable life until he met a grass cutter who wanted to give something to the society so he could be remembered after death too. The grass cutters words were what inspired him to do something that would leave a mark in the society. He wrote two masterpieces in his life among which, one is the Bhanubhaktey Ramayan and the other is a letter he wrote in verse form to the Prime Minister while he was in prison. He was made a scapegoat and sent to prison due to some misunderstanding in signing the papers. In prison, his health deteriorated and he was given false hopes of being set free but his case was not even heard. So, he wrote a petition to the Prime Minister requesting his freedom, which later became one of his great works.He not only won his freedom with his poem but was also given a bag of money (He wrote in the same language the then prime minister want to force the public to use). When he died in 1868, he did not know he would one day be one of the most revered poets of Nepal. His creation, however, was not published and he died without receiving credit for his contribution. His works were published by Motiram Bhatta in 1887 after he found the manuscript and took it to Benaras, India for printing. One of Acharya‚Äôs works is well known for its colourful, glowing praise of Kathmandu valley and its inhabitants. Although he is one of the most celebrated and revered poets of Nepal, his works are not as famous as other poets in the history of Nepali literature. he is the most thing Recognition of him Bhanubhakta Acharya is revered and honoured with the title of Aadakavi (The First-ever Poet) for the Nepali people of Nepal. Motiram Bhatta, first referred to him as Adikavi while writing Acharya‚Äôs biography in 1981. He clarifies that Acharya is not called Adikavi because he was the first poet in Nepal but he deserved the title as he was the first poet who wrote with an understanding of the marma (inner essence) of the poetry. Bhanu Jayanti Bhanu Jayanti is a celebration of the birth anniversary of Bhanubhakta Acharya. It falls on the 29th day of the month of Ashad according to Nepali calendar. It is celebrated every year by the Government of Nepal and Nepalese people as well as by the Nepali speaking people around the world. cultural festival, prevalent among the Nepalese around the world in the remembrance of Bhanubhakta Acharya's birthday anniversary. It is generally celebrated in the 13th of July or the 29th day of the Nepali month of Ashadh. Every year Bhanu Jayanti is celebrated as a mega event with literary seminars, and programs and amid a remarkable presence of Nepalese writers, novelists, and other literary figures/enthusiasts.

The buddha, bodhisattva, or mandala image is located in either a temple or a household butsudan. The image can be either a statue or a small scroll and varies from sect to sect. It can be a singular image or a group of images; the honzon in the main (hondou) or treasure (kondou) hall of the temple can be for that particular hall or the entire temple complex. Sometimes honzon is the central image (chuuson) of a cluster of three (sanzonbutu) or five (goson) images.http://www.aisf.or.jp/jaanus/ The physical creation of an icon is followed by a consecration ceremony (known as kaigen, literally 'opening the eyes' or 'dotting the eyes'). It is believed this transforms the honzon into a 'vessel' of the deity which in its own right has power. Shingon-shu Buzan-ha Mikkyo altar  Butsuz≈ç  A honzon that takes the form of a statue is called a Butsuz≈ç (), most likely crafted out of cypress wood or metal such as copper or bronze. The Butsuz≈ç is more common than other types of images. Tori Busshi was an early and renowned creator of worship statues. The Butsuz≈çzui, originally published in 1690, is a compendium of reproductions of 800 Butsuz≈ç. An example of Butsuz≈ç Honzon in the Pure Land tradition featuring Amida Buddha.  In various sects  Before the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the sixth century there is no evidence of honzon in Shinto worship. Instead, its use was a cultural influence from Buddhism. Each sect of Japanese Buddhism has its own honzon which sometimes varies from temple to temple or even from hall to hall within a given temple. This is a practice that was criticized by Ekai Kawaguchi, a 20th century Japanese religious reformer. Some images (hibutsu, literally \\"secret buddhas\\") are considered too sacred for public presentation.Weinstein, Lucie R. (1989). [The Yumedono Kannon: Problems in Seventh-Century Sculpture], Archives of Asian Art 42, 29Rambelli, Fabio (2002). Secret Buddhas: The Limits of Buddhist Representation, Monumenta Nipponica 57 (3), 271-307 = Shingon Buddhism = In Mikky≈ç practices such as in Shingon Buddhism, the term refers to the divinity honored in a rite.When K≈´kai introduced Shingon Esoteric Buddhism and its Buddhist Pantheon to Japan in the 9th century, the statuary worship practices found in China were incorporated.The body: toward an Eastern mind-body theory Yasuo Yuasa, Thomas P. Kasulis p.125 Over the centuries this developed into the Japanese Buddhist pantheon. The role of the tutelary figure is similar to that of the yidam in Tibetan Buddhism. Tutelary deities in Vajrayana Buddhism, including Mikky≈ç, Tangmi and Tibetan Buddhism, are crucial to many religious practices. = Pure Land Buddhism = In the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ school of Pure Land Buddhism, under the leadership of Honen and Shinran, the use of \\"honzon\\" became more prevalent. The honzon took the form of inscriptions of the sect's mantra Namu Amida Buddha, other phrases, images of the Buddha, statuary, and even representations of the founder. Rennyo thought a honzon in the form of a written mantra was more appropriate than that of statue. = Rissho Koseikai = In the Rissho Kosei Kai members receive and practice to a honzon enshrined in their homes they label a \\"Daigohonzon\\". The scroll consists of an image of Shakyamuni At the Rissho Kosei-kai headquarters there is a Gohonzon that is a statue of Shakyamuni. = Zen Buddhism = According to Suzuki, the proper honzon for the Zen altar is Shakyamuni Buddha. He is often attended by other Bodhisattvas and arhats such as statues of Kwannon (Avalokitesvara), Yakusi (Bhaishajyaguru), Jiz≈ç (Kshitigarbha), or Miroku (Maitreya). Sometimes there is a trio of Amida (representing the past), Shakyamuni (the present), and Miroku (the future). There are other choices and combinations often influenced by the guiding philosophy of a temple.

S√∂mmerring discovered the macula in the retina of the human eye. His investigations on the brain and the nervous system, on the sensory organs, on the embryo and its malformations, on the structure of the lungs, etc., made him one of the most important German anatomists. Career Portrait by Karl Thelott S√∂mmerring was born in Thorn (Toru≈Ñ), Royal Prussia (a province of the Crown of Poland) as the ninth child of the physician Johann Thomas S√∂mmerring. In 1774 he completed his education in Thorn and began to study medicine at the University of G√∂ttingen. He visited Petrus Camper lecturing at the University in Franeker. He became a professor of anatomy at the Collegium Carolinum (housed in the Ottoneum, now a Natural History Museum) in Kassel and, beginning in 1784, at the University of Mainz. There he was for five years the dean of the medical faculty. Due to the fact that Mainz became part of the French Republic under the French Directory, S√∂mmerring opened up a practice in Frankfurt in 1795. As one of his many important enterprises, S√∂mmerring introduced against many resistances the vaccination against smallpox and became one of the first members of the Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft and was nominated as counselor. He received offers of employment by the University of Jena and the University of St. Petersburg, but accepted in 1804 an invitation from the Academy of Science of Bavaria, in Munich. In this city, he became counselor to the court and was led into the Bavarian nobility. When S√∂mmerring was 23 years old he described the organization of the cranial nerves as part of this doctoral work: its study is still valid today. He published many writings in the fields of medicine, anatomy and neuroanatomy, anthropology, paleontology, astronomy and philosophy. Among other things he wrote about fossil crocodiles and in 1812 he described Ornithocephalus antiquus now known as Pterodactylus. He was also the first to accurately draw a representation of the female skeleton structure. In addition, S√∂mmerring was a very creative inventor, having designed a telescope for astronomical observations and an electrical telegraph in 1809. He worked on the refinement of wines, sunspots and many diverse other things. In 1811 he developed the first telegraphic system in Bavaria, which is housed today in the German Museum of Science in Munich. In 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. S√∂mmering was married to Margarethe Elizabeth Grunelius (deceased 1802), and had a son, Dietmar William, and a daughter, Susanne Katharina. Due to bad weather, S√∂mmering left Munich in 1820 and returned to Frankfurt, where he died in 1830. He is buried at the city's main cemetery. A subspecies of the Western jackdaw, Corvus monedula soemmerringii, living in north-eastern Europe and north and central Asia, was named after S√∂mmering in 1811 by Johann Fischer von Waldheim.

In addition to the airfield, the base includes the \\"UAV-Logistic and Training Facility\\", the Joint Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence, Silver Flag Alpha Regional Training Center, and other military units/facilities. The base is named in honor of retired US Air Force General Wilbur L. Creech, the former commanding officer of Tactical Air Command (TAC), the predecessor command of the current Air Combat Command (ACC). History After World War I, Nevada and other western inland states were surveyed by Capt. Lowell H. Smith and Sgt. William B. Whitefield for landing sites. The United States Army Air Corps subsequently rented a large room in Reno, and used the 1929 civilian airfield near Las Vegas (named \\"McCarran Field\\" ) for 1930s training flights. A 1939 \\"western site board\\" reconnaissance was conducted near Tonopah for a practice range and in October 1940, Maj. David Schlatter surveyed the southwest United States for a military airfield (Executive Order 8578 transferred a \\"60 √ó 90-mile area at Tonopah to the War Department on 29 October 1940\\".)

The base is home to drone operators who pilot drones for both the U.S. military and the CIA in missions across Afghanistan and the Middle East. A week earlier drones had killed 30 civilian farmers in Afghanistan. =Indian Springs Army Airfield= The Nevada World War II Army Airfield at Indian Springs hosted B-17 Flying Fortress and T-6 Texan aircraft. Five Indian Springs Auxiliary Army Airfields were developed at the bombing range. Area 18 had an auxiliary field at Auxiliary Field #4, and Area 51 had an auxiliary field Auxiliary Field #1. In March 1945 Indian Springs AAF was placed on stand-by with a small housekeeping staff and in January 1947, it was closed along with Las Vegas AAF. The Army reopened Indian Springs in January 1948 and in 1950, the first US Air Force unit was assigned to the installation.

Ancillary missions were carried out including target marking at the nearby bombing range for the aircraft from Nellis AFB as well as searching for and retrieving weather balloons. In 1966, the unit replaced two Kaman HH-43 Huskie helicopters with two Bell UH-1F Huey utility helicopters. During the 1970s and 1980s, the primary base mission was range maintenance and the primary unit was the 57th Combat Support Squadron of civil engineers‚Äîthe only assigned aircraft unit was a detachment of Bell UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters (designated as \\"Det 1\\"). The 1982 Thunderbirds Indian Springs Diamond Crash killed all four Northrop T-38 Talon pilots impacting along the runway (controlled flight into terrain). Around 1988 the bulk of Silver Flag Alpha moved to the Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field from Nellis. Indian Springs AFAF was designated a Formerly Used Defense Site by 30 September 2002. In January 2005, No 1115 Flight was formed at the base to operate the Royal Air Force's first UAVs (became part of No. 39 Squadron RAF in March 2007). =Creech AFB= An MQ-9 taxies on a Creech AFB runway On 20 June 2005, Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field officially changed its name to Creech Air Force Base in honor of Wilbur L. \\"Bill\\" Creech, the commander of Tactical Air Command from 1978 to 1984, and activated in October 2005 the Joint Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence and the 3d Special Operations Squadron (the latter was the 1st MQ-1 Predator squadron in the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). The 42d Attack Squadron was formed at Creech AFB on 8 November 2006 as the first Reaper squadron. By 2007, Creech personnel of the 432nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron had been deployed to Ali Air Base, and the base transferred from a Nellis AFB unit to the 432d Wing when activated on 1 May 2007 On 5 March 2008, the 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron became operational as \\"the Air Force's [1st] test squadron for unmanned aerial systems\\". In 2008 the USGS added the military installation to the Geographic Names Information System (the airport portion of the base was separately designated in 2011). A 2009 Nevada Desert Experience protest against drone attacks on Pakistan by the United States of America resulted in the convictions of the \\"Creech 14\\" (e.g., Father Louie Vitale, Kathy Kelly, and John Dear) arrested on the baseVCNV for trespassing and sentenced on 27 January 2011 for time served (a 2009 protest was also held.) In 2011, keystroke logging software had infected UAV ground stations (\\"believed to have spread through...removable drives\\"), and the Twenty-Fourth Air Force was alerted to the problem by an article in Wired magazine. (The virus \\"posed no threat to our operational mission\\".) In 2012, the ceremony in which the 99th Security Forces Group \\"stands down\\" also activated the 799th Air Base Group at Creech. In July 2019, the 799th Air Base Group was inactivated and responsibility for base support operations transferred to the newly activated the 432nd Mission Support Group, part of the 432nd Wing. The change allowed the 432nd Wing to become installation command authority at Creech, representing a shift away from the base relying on nearby Nellis AFB for support. Silver Flag Alpha RTC HMMWV Egress Assistance Training' (HEAT) at Silver Flag Alpha RTC Creech is also home to the \\"Silver Flag Alpha Regional Training Center\\", operated by the 99th Ground Combat Training Squadron (99 GCTS). At Silver Flag Alpha, Security Forces airmen receive mission-specific training prior to being deployed to combat areas. There are two basic courses taught at Silver Flag Alpha; the 17-day Base Security Operations Course which focuses on base defense from within the base boundary and the Area Security Operations Course for airmen whose deployment tasking includes \\"outside the wire\\" missions where the airmen leave the base perimeter to conduct various missions. Military Working Dog handlers receive additional training along with attending one of the two Silver Flag Alpha courses. Depending on the course the airmen may receive training on the following: * Vehicles: uparmored Humvees, MRAPs, MATVs. Which may or may not be equipped with the CROWS system for remotely operating mounted weapons such as the M2, M-240 or Mk 19 grenade launcher. * Tactical Automated Sensor Systems, for base perimeter sensor systems. * Heavy weapons qualifications courses for the M2 Mk 19 and M107 * Non-lethal weapons: shotgun/grenade launcher/hand grenade rounds; expandable baton; taser; and glare mout lasers.

Collins English Dictionary. of the second creation (c. 1520 ‚Äì 30 December 1595) was the elder son of Sir George West (d.1538), second son of Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr, by his third wife, Eleanor Copley, and Elizabeth Morton, widow of Robert Walden, and daughter of Sir Robert Morton of Lechlade, Gloucestershire. He was nephew and adopted heir of his uncle of the half blood, Thomas West, 9th Baron De La Warr, eldest son of the 8th Baron's second wife, Elizabeth Mortimer. Inheritance According to Riordan: > [In 1549 the 9th Baron] placed a private bill before parliament to > disinherit his nephew William West, first Baron De La Warr (c.1519‚Äì1595). > The latter was the son of the ninth baron's half-brother Sir George West of > Warbleton (d. 1538) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Morton > of Lechlade, Gloucestershire. His uncle was childless, and had at some time > adopted William as his heir. However, West tried to gain the de la Warr > estate early by poisoning his uncle. The attempt was unsuccessful and he was > in the Tower by October 1548. He was disinherited by an act of parliament in > 1550, although he had been reinstated as heir by the time of his uncle's > death. Despite the fact that he had been reinstated as heir by his uncle, when the latter died in 1554 William West was unable to inherit the barony of de la Warr as a result of the Act of Parliament of 1550 which had deprived him of all honours. Two years later he was involved in the Dudley, and on 30 June 1556 was arraigned at the Guildhall on charges of treason, to which he responded as 'William, Lord de la Warr', forcing the heralds to prove during the trial that he was not entitled to the barony and therefore not entitled to a trial by his peers in the House of Lords. He was convicted of treason. However the death sentence was not carried out, and in 1557 he was pardoned by Queen Mary. He fought at the siege of St. Quentin in that year, and in 1563, early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was restored in blood. On 5 February 1570 he was knighted, and on the same day created Baron De La Warr, which was regarded as a new creation of the title. Peerage West took part as a peer in the trials and convictions of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk and, later, his son, Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel. He was junior peer in his lifetime, as latest created. However, his son and descendants have been seated with the precedence of 1299, as though they had inherited his uncle Thomas's title. By the modern rules of the House of Lords, his uncle's title fell into abeyance between the daughters of William West's second uncle, Sir Owen West, or their heirs; however, as Cokayne notes, such rules are at best modern approximations to actual medieval practice. What seems clear is that some, but not all, writers treat the letters patent as clarifying the descent of the ancient title, rather than creating a new one, hence William is sometimes referred to as 10th baron. Personal life He married Elizabeth Strange and was the father of three sons and three daughters, Jane, Elizabeth, and Mary. Jane West married firstly Thomas Wenman, secondly James Cressy, and thirdly Thomas Tasburgh (c.1554 ‚Äì c.1602), of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire.Tasburgh, Thomas (c.1554‚Äì1602), of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire, History of Parliament.

Informally, it says that all sufficiently long words in a regular language may be pumped‚Äîthat is, have a middle section of the word repeated an arbitrary number of times‚Äîto produce a new word that also lies within the same language. Specifically, the pumping lemma says that for any regular language L there exists a constant p such that any word w in L with length at least p can be split into three substrings, w = xyz, where the middle portion y must not be empty, such that the words xz, xyz, xyyz, xyyyz, ... constructed by repeating y zero or more times are still in L. This process of repetition is known as \\"pumping\\". Moreover, the pumping lemma guarantees that the length of xy will be at most p, imposing a limit on the ways in which w may be split. Finite languages vacuously satisfy the pumping lemma by having p equal to the maximum string length in L plus one. The pumping lemma is useful for disproving the regularity of a specific language in question. It was first proven by Michael Rabin and Dana Scott in 1959, Here: Lemma 8, p.119 and rediscovered shortly after by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, Micha A. Perles, and Eli Shamir in 1961, as a simplification of their pumping lemma for context-free languages. Here: Sect.4.6, p.166  Formal statement  Let L be a regular language. Then there exists an integer p \\\\geq 1 depending only on L such that every string w in L of length at least p (p is called the \\"pumping length\\") can be written as w = xyz (i.e., w can be divided into three substrings), satisfying the following conditions: * y \\\\geq 1 * xy \\\\leq p * (\\\\forall n \\\\geq 0) ( xy^nz \\\\in L ) y is the substring that can be pumped (removed or repeated any number of times, and the resulting string is always in L). (1) means the loop y to be pumped must be of length at least one; (2) means the loop must occur within the first p characters. x must be smaller than p (conclusion of (1) and (2)), but apart from that, there is no restriction on x and z. In simple words, for any regular language L, any sufficiently long word w (in L) can be split into 3 parts. i.e. w = xyz , such that all the strings xy^nz for n \\\\geq 0 are also in L. Below is a formal expression of the Pumping Lemma. \\\\begin{array}{l} (\\\\forall L\\\\subseteq \\\\Sigma^*)  \\\\quad (\\\\mbox{regular}(L) \\\\Rightarrow  \\\\quad ((\\\\exists p\\\\geq 1) ( (\\\\forall w\\\\in L) ((w\\\\geq p) \\\\Rightarrow  \\\\quad ((\\\\exists x,y,z \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*) (w=xyz \\\\land (y\\\\geq 1 \\\\land xy\\\\leq p \\\\land (\\\\forall n\\\\geq 0)(xy^nz\\\\in L)))))))) \\\\end{array}  Use of the lemma  The pumping lemma is often used to prove that a particular language is non-regular: a proof by contradiction (of the language's regularity) may consist of exhibiting a word (of the required length) in the language that lacks the property outlined in the pumping lemma. For example, the language L = \\\\\\\\{a^n b^n : n \\\\geq 0\\\\\\\\} over the alphabet \\\\Sigma = \\\\\\\\{a, b\\\\\\\\} can be shown to be non-regular as follows: Let w, x, y, z, p, and n be as used in the formal statement for the pumping lemma above. We assume that there exists some constant p. Let w in L be given by w = a^p b^p, which is a string longer than p. By the pumping lemma, there must be some decomposition w = xyz with xy \\\\leq p and y \\\\geq 1 such that xy^iz in L for every i \\\\geq 0. Using xy \\\\leq p, we know y only consists of instances of a. Moreover, because y \\\\geq 1, it contains at least one instance of the letter a. We now pump y up: xy^2z has more instances of the letter a than the letter b, since we have added some instances of a without adding instances of b. Therefore, xy^2z is not in L. We have reached a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that L is regular (i.e. there exists such a p) must be incorrect. Hence L is not regular. The proof that the language of balanced (i.e., properly nested) parentheses is not regular follows the same idea. Given p, there is a string of balanced parentheses that begins with more than p left parentheses, so that y will consist entirely of left parentheses. By repeating y, we can produce a string that does not contain the same number of left and right parentheses, and so they cannot be balanced.  Proof of the pumping lemma  string xyz is recognized by a finite automaton, it must have reached some state (q_s = q_t) twice. Hence, after repeating (\\"pumping\\") the middle part y arbitrarily often (xyyz, xyyyz, ...) the word will still be recognized. For every regular language there is a finite state automaton (FSA) that accepts the language. The number of states in such an FSA are counted and that count is used as the pumping length p. For a string of length at least p, let q_0 be the start state and let q_1, ..., q_p be the sequence of the next p states visited as the string is emitted. Because the FSA has only p states, within this sequence of p+1 visited states there must be at least one state that is repeated. Write q_s for such a state. The transitions that take the machine from the first encounter of state q_s to the second encounter of state q_s match some string. This string is called y in the lemma, and since the machine will match a string without the y portion, or with the string y repeated any number of times, the conditions of the lemma are satisfied. For example, the following image shows an FSA. File:An automat accepting the language a(bc)*d.svg The FSA accepts the string: abcd. Since this string has a length at least as large as the number of states, which is four, the pigeonhole principle indicates that there must be at least one repeated state among the start state and the next four visited states. In this example, only q_1 is a repeated state. Since the substring bc takes the machine through transitions that start at state q_1 and end at state q_1, that portion could be repeated and the FSA would still accept, giving the string . Alternatively, the bc portion could be removed and the FSA would still accept giving the string ad. In terms of the pumping lemma, the string abcd is broken into an x portion a, a y portion bc and a z portion d.  General version of pumping lemma for regular languages  If a language L is regular, then there exists a number p \\\\geq 1 (the pumping length) such that every string uwv in L with w ‚â• p can be written in the form :uwv = uxyzv with strings x, y and z such that xy \\\\le p, y \\\\ge 1 and :uxy^izv is in L for every integer i \\\\geq 0. From this, the above standard version follows a special case, with both u and v being the empty string. Since the general version imposes stricter requirements on the language, it can be used to prove the non-regularity of many more languages, such as \\\\\\\\{ a^m b^n c^n : m \\\\geq 1 \\\\text{ and } n \\\\geq 1 \\\\\\\\}. Here: p. 72, Exercise 3.2 (which give a slightly less general version, requiring w=p) and 3.3  Converse of lemma not true  While the pumping lemma states that all regular languages satisfy the conditions described above, the converse of this statement is not true: a language that satisfies these conditions may still be non-regular. In other words, both the original and the general version of the pumping lemma give a necessary but not sufficient condition for a language to be regular. For example, consider the following language: :\\\\begin{matrix}L & = & \\\\\\\\{uvwxy : u,y \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\\\\\}^*; v,w,x \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\land (v=w \\\\lor v=x \\\\lor x=w)\\\\\\\\}  & & \\\\cup \\\\ \\\\\\\\{w : w \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\\\\\}^*\\\\land \\\\text {precisely } \\\\tfrac 1 7 \\\\text{ of the characters in }w \\\\text{ are 3's}\\\\\\\\}\\\\end{matrix}. In other words, L contains all strings over the alphabet \\\\\\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\\\\\} with a substring of length 3 including a duplicate character, as well as all strings over this alphabet where precisely 1/7 of the string's characters are 3's. This language is not regular but can still be \\"pumped\\" with p = 5. Suppose some string s has length at least 5. Then, since the alphabet has only four characters, at least two of the first five characters in the string must be duplicates. They are separated by at most three characters. * If the duplicate characters are separated by 0 characters, or 1, pump one of the other two characters in the string, which will not affect the substring containing the duplicates. * If the duplicate characters are separated by 2 or 3 characters, pump 2 of the characters separating them. Pumping either down or up results in the creation of a substring of size 3 that contains 2 duplicate characters. * The second condition of L ensures that L is not regular: Consider the string (013)^{3m}(012)^i. This string is in L exactly when i=4m and thus L is not regular by the Myhill‚ÄìNerode theorem. The Myhill‚ÄìNerode theorem provides a test that exactly characterizes regular languages. The typical method for proving that a language is regular is to construct either a finite state machine or a regular expression for the language.

It was a vertical take-off and landing tailsitter interceptor design for local defense of important factories or areas which had small or no airfields. The Triebfl√ºgel had only reached wind-tunnel testing when the Allied forces reached the production facilities. No complete prototype was ever built. Design The design was particularly unusual. It had no wings, and all lift and thrust were provided by a rotor/propeller assembly 1/3 of the way down the side of the craft (roughly halfway between the cockpit and tailplane). When the plane was sitting on its tail in the vertical position, the rotors would have functioned similarly to a helicopter. When flying horizontally, they would function more like a giant propeller. The three rotor blades were mounted on a ring assembly supported by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At the end of each was a ramjet. To start the rotors spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no reaction torque to cause a counter rotation of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the centre support ring and along the rotors to the jets. A cruciform empennage at the rear of the fuselage comprised four tailplanes, fitted with moving ailerons that would also have functioned as combined rudders and elevators. The tailplane would have provided a means for the pilot to control a tendency of the fuselage to rotate in the same direction as the rotor, caused by the friction of the rotor ring, as well as controlling flight in pitch, roll and yaw. A single large and sprung wheel in the extreme end of the fuselage provided the main undercarriage. Four small castoring wheels on extensible struts were placed at the end of each tailplane to steady the aircraft on the ground and allow it to be moved. The main and outrigger wheels were covered by streamlined clamshell doors when in flight. When taking off, the rotors would be angled to give lift in a similar manner to a helicopter. Once the aircraft had attained sufficient altitude the pilot would tilt it over into level flight. The rotors continued spinning in level flight, maintaining 220 rpm at the aircraft's maximum forward speed.Sharp, D.; Luftwaffe: Secret Jets of the Third Reich, Mortons, 2015, Pages 98‚Äì101. Forward flight required a slight nose-up pitch to provide some upward lift as well as primarily forward thrust. Consequently, the four cannon in the forward fuselage would have been angled slightly downward in relation to the centreline of the fuselage. To land, the craft had to slow its speed and pitch the fuselage until the craft was vertical. Power could then be reduced and it would descend until the landing gear rested on the ground. This would have been a tricky and probably dangerous maneuver, given that the pilot would be seated facing upward and the ground would be behind his head at this stage. Unlike some other tailsitter aircraft, the pilot's seat was fixed in the direction for forward flight. The spinning rotor would also obscure rear vision. =Comparable aircraft designs= This design was unique among 20th- century VTOL craft, and other German concept craft. However, some early design studies for the Rotary Rocket Roton spacecraft in the 1990s showed a free- spinning rotor with tip-driven rotors providing lift. In the 1950s, the US built prototype tailsitter aircraft (the Lockheed XFV, and Convair XFY Pogo), but these were powered by conventional turboprops, with nose-mounted contra- rotating propellers to counter torque. They also used conventional wings for lift, though their cruciform tails with integral landing gear were broadly comparable to the Triebfl√ºgel.

Biography  Born in Hebei, China, Wei was a poor farmer who moved to Beijing. There, he started working as a street vendor but eventually became the prosperous owner of several clothing shops. He attributed his newfound prosperity to his conversion to Christianity. He had joined the Beijing branch of the London Missionary Society led by British missionary Samuel Evans Meech (1845-1937). Melissa Wei-Tsing Inouye, China and the True Jesus: Charisma and Organization in a Chinese Christian Church, New York: Oxford University Press, 2018, 86‚Äì118. When attending the London Missionary Society, Wei was also influenced by Cheng Jingyi, and espoused some teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In 1915, Wei met Norwegian missionary to China Bernt Berntsen, became a Pentecostal and joined his Apostolic Faith Mission. In May 1917, Wei reportedly heard a voice telling him that ‚Äúyou must receive the baptism of Jesus.‚Äù He felt he should go to the Yongdingmen gate in Beijing, where the voice asked him to proceed to a nearby river where, as he reported, Jesus appeared and personally baptized him facedown, giving him an armor and a sword. Satan also appeared, but Wei defeated him with the sword received from Jesus. After this vision, Wei left the Apostolic Faith Church and founded his own church, which he called the True Jesus Church. His followers believed that Wei‚Äôs vision had restored the original Christian church. They hailed Wei as ‚Äúthe new Martin Luther,‚Äù commissioned by Jesus to reform and restore the genuine Christian Church.Inouye (2018), 86‚Äì118. Despite oppositions, including by Berntsen, who sued Wei claiming he had defrauded him of revenues of a business partnership they had established together, the True Jesus Church was able to gather several thousand members. Wei predicted that the world will end in 1921 or 1922. He died of tuberculosis on September 10, 1919, and the failure of his prophecy did not prevent the further growth of the True Jesus Church.Inouye (2018), 101‚Äì118. Among several leaders, his son Wei Wenxiang (È≠èÊñáÁ••, Isaac Wei, È≠è‰ª•Êíí, ca. 1900-?) emerged as the main representative of the True Jesus Church, until he was arrested in 1951. The True Jesus Church was severely persecuted before and during the Cultural Revolution, but was again allowed to operate in China in the 1980s, gathering again a substantial following.Inouye (2018), 187‚Äì259.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 1, 2005, though it had premiered three days earlier at a special screening at the University of Vermont, Burlington. In the episode, Peter and Lois go on a second honeymoon to spice up their marriage, but are chased by Mel Gibson after Peter steals the sequel to The Passion of the Christ from Gibson's private hotel room. Meanwhile, Brian and Stewie take care of Chris and Meg at home. Family Guy had been canceled in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on Adult Swim became the cable network's most watched program, and more than three million DVDs of the show were sold. Written by series creator Seth MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin, much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock movie North by Northwest; in addition, the episode makes use of Bernard Herrmann's theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29 shows that were canceled by Fox after Family Guy was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning. Critical responses to \\"North by North Quahog\\" were mostly positive, with the opening sequence being praised in particular. The episode was watched by nearly 12 million viewers and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour). Shin won an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for this episode. Plot In the cold open, Peter tells his family that they have \\"been canceled\\". He then lists all 29 shows, like Titus and Andy Richter Controls the Universe, that were canceled by Fox between the show's cancellation and revival and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning. As Peter and Lois are having sex, she yells out George Clooney's name, so Peter realizes that she is imagining him as Clooney to maintain her libido. Lois and Peter decide to take a second honeymoon to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian to take care of their children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which the school principal catches Chris in the boys' restroom with vodka that belongs to his classmate Jake Tucker. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father Tom refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting cocaine in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to community service. On the way to their vacation spot, Lois falls asleep. Unfortunately, Peter doesn't pay attention to the road, deciding instead to read a comic book while driving, and crashes the car into a tree. They are forced to spend their entire honeymoon money on car repairs and are about to return home when Peter discovers that actor/director Mel Gibson has a private suite at a luxurious hotel nearby, \\"which he barely uses\\". He and Lois then go to the hotel, where Peter poses as Gibson to gain access to his room. When Lois yells out Gibson's name during intercourse, Peter, again, decides to return home. As the two are about to leave, Peter accidentally stumbles upon Gibson's private screening room and discovers a sequel to The Passion of the Christ entitled The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This. To spare the world from \\"... another two hours of Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo-jumbo,\\" Peter steals the film. However, when they leave the hotel, they are noticed by two priests, Gibson's associates, who were there to collect the film. Pursued by the priests in a car chase that leads them through a shopping mall, Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he is doing so, the priests fly down in a crop-duster and kidnap Lois. Peter is then given a message telling him that if he does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of Mount Rushmore, his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with dog feces, leading to a chase on the face of the mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to George Washington's lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film \\"is in President Rushmore's mouth\\" and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge (Peter claims that Christians don't believe in gravity) as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage. Production and development In 2002, Family Guy was canceled after three seasons due to low ratings. The show was first canceled after the 1999‚Äì2000 season, but following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it was hard to find networks that were interested; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, \\" basically for free\\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production. When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in 2003, Family Guy became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode. Following Family Guys high ratings on Adult Swim, the first season was released on DVD in April 2003. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show. The second season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show's popularity in both DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest in it. They ordered 35 new episodes in 2004, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales. Fox president Gail Berman said that it was one of her most difficult decisions to cancel the show, and was therefore happy it would return. The network also began production of a film based on the series. alt=A man with short black hair and a black shirt in front of a microphone. He touches his chin with his left hand. \\"North by North Quahog\\" was the first episode to be broadcast after the show's cancellation. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin, both of whom also wrote and directed the pilot. MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and towards the end of their seasons \\"... you see a lot more sex jokes and (bodily function) jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried\\". With \\"North by North Quahog\\", the writing staff tried to keep the show \\"... exactly as it was\\" before its cancellation, and did not \\"... have the desire to make it any slicker\\" than it already was. Walter Murphy, who had composed music for the show before its cancellation, returned to compose the music for \\"North by North Quahog\\". Murphy and the orchestra recorded an arrangement of Bernard Herrmann's score from North by Northwest, a film referenced multiple times in the episode. Fox had ordered five episode scripts at the end of the third season; these episodes had been written but not produced. One of these scripts was adapted into \\"North by North Quahog\\". The original script featured Star Wars character Boba Fett, and later actor, writer and producer Aaron Spelling, but the release of the iconic film The Passion of the Christ inspired the writers to incorporate Mel Gibson into the episode. Multiple endings were written, including one in which Death comes for Gibson. During production, an episode of South Park was released entitled \\"The Passion of the Jew\\" that also featured Gibson as a prominent character. This gave the Family Guy writers pause, fearing accusations \\" that we had ripped them off.\\" Three days before the episode debuted on television, it was screened at the University of Vermont (UVM) in Burlington, accompanied by an hour-long question-and-answer session with MacFarlane. The UVM's special screening of the episode was attended by 1,700 people. As promotion for the show, and to, as Newman described, \\"expand interest in the show beyond its die hard fans\\", Fox organized four Family Guy Live! performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud; \\"North by North Quahog\\" was also previewed. In addition, the cast performed musical numbers from the Family Guy Live in Vegas comedy album. The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival. The Family Guy Live! performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each. Cultural references Actor Mel Gibson is prominently featured as a character in the episode The episode opens with Peter telling the rest of the family that Family Guy has been canceled. He lists the following 29 shows (in chronological order), that he says Fox has to make room for: Dark Angel (lasted for 2 seasons and cult following), Titus (though Titus was facing cancellation the same year Family Guy was), Undeclared, Action, That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts (the show that Seth MacFarlane worked on after Family Guy's cancellation), Firefly, Get Real, FreakyLinks, Wanda at Large, Costello (premiered before Family Guy hit the airwaves), The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance, the joke being all these shows had indeed already been canceled by Fox. The New York Times reported that, during the first Family Guy Live! performance, \\"... the longer [the list] went, the louder the laughs from the Town Hall crowd [became]\\". Australian-American actor Mel Gibson is prominently featured in the episode; his voice was impersonated by Andr√© Sogliuzzo. Gibson directed the film The Passion of the Christ (2004) and, in the episode, is seen making a sequel entitled Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This. The fictional sequel is a combination of The Passion of the Christ and Rush Hour (1998), and stars Chris Tucker, who starred in Rush Hour, and Jim Caviezel who portrayed Jesus in The Passion of the Christ. Besides the title, the episode contains several references to Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 film North by Northwest, including the scene where Lois is kidnapped by Gibson's associates, the two priests flying a crop-duster who chase Peter through a cornfield, and the final face-off between Peter, Lois and Gibson that takes place on Mount Rushmore. As Peter and Lois are driving to Cape Cod for their second honeymoon, Peter is reading a Jughead comic book and their car crashes. The fictional Park Barrington Hotel, where Peter and Lois steal Gibson's film, is located in Manhattan. The car chase scene through a shopping mall is a recreation of a scene from the 1980 comedy film The Blues Brothers. To stop Meg and Chris from fighting, Brian reads to them from one of the few books Peter owns, a novelization of the 1980 film Caddyshack and quotes a line by Chevy Chase's character, Ty Webb. The episode contains a number of other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Geppetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that \\"... knowing is half the battle\\". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice \\" you take it with a little bit more gravitas\\". Reception \\"North by North Quahog\\" was broadcast on May 1, 2005 as part of an animated television night on Fox, was preceded by two episodes of The Simpsons (including the show's 350th episode), and was followed by the premiere of MacFarlane's new show, American Dad!. It was watched by 11.85 million viewers, higher than both The Simpsons and American Dad. The episode's ratings were Family Guys highest ratings since the airing of the season one episode \\"Brian: Portrait of a Dog\\". Family Guy was the week's highest-rated show among teens and men in the 18 to 34 demographic, and more than doubled Fox's average in its timeslot. The episode's first broadcast in Canada on Global was watched by 1.27 million viewers, making it fourth for the week it was broadcast, behind CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami and Canadian Idol. The reactions of television critics to \\"North by North Quahog\\" were mostly positive. In a simultaneous review of the two episodes of The Simpsons that preceded this episode and the American Dad! pilot, Chase Squires of the St. Petersburg Times stated that \\"North by North Quahog\\" \\"... score[d] the highest\\". Multimedia news and reviews website IGN was pleased to see Stewie and Brian get more screen time as a duo, something they thought had always been one of the show's biggest strengths. IGN placed Peter's idea to pose as Mel Gibson and steal Passion of the Christ 2 in 9th place on their list of \\"Peter Griffin's Top 10 Craziest Ideas\\". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commented that the episode's material \\"would wear thin after a while if the character's weren't as distinct and endearing as they are, most notably Stewie, the wrathful infant.\\" Critics reacted positively to the opening sequence; in his review of the episode, Mark McGuire of The Times Union wrote: \\"... the first minute or so of the resurrected Family Guy ranks among the funniest 60 seconds I've seen so far this season.\\" Variety critic Brian Lowry considered the opening sequence to be the best part of the episode. M. Keith Booker, author of the book Drawn to Television: Primetime Television from The Flintstones to Family Guy, called the opening sequence an \\"... in-your-face, I-told-you-so rejoinder to the Fox brass followed by one of the most outrageous Family Guy episodes ever\\". However, the episode also garnered negative responses. Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer stated that \\"Three years off the air has not made the 'Family Guy' team that much more creative\\". Kevin Wong of PopMatters thought the episode made fun of easy targets such as Gibson and The Passion of The Christ, although he felt Family Guy regained \\"... its admirable mix of niche nostalgia and hysterical characterizations\\" after the first two episodes of the new season. Though Alex Strachan, critic for The Montreal Gazette, praised the opening sequence, he felt \\"it's all downhill from there\\". Bill Brioux of the Toronto Star considered the show to be similar to The Simpsons. Media watchdog group the Parents Television Council, a frequent critic of the show, branded the episode the \\"worst show of the week\\". \\"North by North Quahog\\" was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour), the eventual recipient of the award being South Park episode \\"Best Friends Forever\\". Peter Shin, director of the episode, won the Annie Award for Best Directing in an Animated Television Production. Fellow Family Guy director Dan Povenmire, was nominated for the same award for directing \\"PTV\\".

House of Uday and Qusay Hussein in Mosul, Iraq destroyed by members of Task Force 121 in July 2003 Task Force 121 was a United States Department of Defense special operations task force. TF121 was a multi-service force from Joint Special Operations Command, made up of operators from the U.S. Army's Delta Force, 75th Ranger Regiment, and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, the U.S. Navy's SEAL Team Six, the CIA's Special Activities Division, U.S. Air Force Combat Controllers, Pararescuemen, Tactical Air Control Party operators, and Special Operations Weather Technicians, the Aviation Tactics Evaluation Group (AvTEG), and the Joint Communications Unit. Two companies of armor from the U.S. Army 4th Infantry Division provided armor support.  History  TF121 was a combination of the now defunct Task Force 5 and Task Force 20, which operated in Afghanistan and Iraq respectively. Acting on the apparent logistic redundancy of keeping two separate task force teams for Iraq and Afghanistan, General John Abizaid decided to combine both teams into a single streamlined force, forming the TF121.Urban, Mark. Task Force Black, p. 63 The force was approximately 1,500 soldiers with its own support capabilities. Task Force 20's primary goal was to capture or kill \\"High-value targets\\" (HVTs), such as Iraqi Mujahideen leaders and former Ba'ath party regime members and leaders. Task Force 20 operators were directly involved in the 4-hour firefight between 101st Airborne soldiers and Saddam Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay Hussein. The two sons were killed in the shootout. The apprehending of the most wanted man in Iraq, Saddam Hussein, in Operation Red Dawn directly involved Task Force 121 operators and members of the Army's 4th Infantry Division.Urban, p. 83 Task Force 20 was also involved in what the US military calls a tragic accident on 27 July 2003. At least three Iraqis were killed in western Baghdad's Mansour district, when US soldiers from Task Force 20 opened fire on cars that overshot a military cordon. The drivers apparently had missed the cordon when they turned into the area from an unblocked side street. = Mission = TF121's primary mission was the apprehension of High Value Targets and was organized in such a way that it has a close relationship with intelligence personnel and has timely and unhindered access to any relevant data gathered by intelligence assets in the area. Such an option is invaluable to any Special Operations team, and especially so to one whose primary mission is hunting elusive fugitives whose hideouts change frequently and randomly.Urban, p. 92 Many TF121 groups were assigned Special Operations CIRA (Communications Intelligence Reconnaissance and Action) personnel with expertise in relevant fields. These operators work closely with the intelligence agencies tied to TF121 and work to pinpoint and identify HVTs aggressively. = Achievements = On 21 July 2003, Saddam's sons Uday and Qusay were killed in a firefight with TF20 operators and soldiers from 101st Airborne. On 13 December 2003, Operation Red Dawn netted HVT #1, Saddam Hussein. After intelligence narrowed down the target to two possible locations, TF121 coordinated the raid with 600 soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team and Apache Troop 1-1 Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division.  Detainee abuse  According to an internal army investigation leaked to the Washington Post, Task Force 121 was responsible for the illegal abuse of detainees in secret interrogation facilities in Iraq. In 2006, after the unit had changed its name to Task Force 6-26, a Human Rights Watch report recorded evidence of continued abuse, including beatings and waterboarding.

They make the wearer appear taller, accentuates the muscle tone in their legs and makes their legs appear visibly taller. There are many types of high heels, which come in different styles, colors and materials, and can be found all over the world. They have significant cultural and fashionable meanings attached to them, which have been largely shaped by historical contexts over the past 1,000 years. Wearing high heels is associated with some health problems.  History  = Pre-1700s = European heeled shoes from ca. 1690 High heels have a long history, dating as far back as the tenth century. The Persian cavalry, for example, wore a kind of boot with heels in order to ensure their feet stayed in the stirrups. Furthermore, research indicates that heels kept arrow- shooting riders, who stood up on galloping horses, safely on the horse. This trend has translated into the popular 21st-century cowboy boot. Owning horses was expensive and time-consuming, so to wear heels implied the wearer had significant wealth.Trufelman, Avery. \\"Feet of Engineering.\\" 99% Invisible. Jun 2014. This practical and effective use of the heel has set the standard for most horse-back riding shoes throughout history and even into the present day. Later, in the 12th century in India, heels become visible again. The image of a statue from the Ramappa Temple proves this, showing an Indian woman's foot clad in a raised shoe. Then, during the Medieval period, both men and women wore platform shoes in order to raise themselves out of the trash and excrement filled streets. In 1430, chopines were high, at times. Venetian law then limited the height to three inches‚Äîbut this regulation was widely ignored. A 17th-century law in Massachusetts announced that women would be subjected to the same treatment as witches if they lured men into marriage via the use of high-heeled shoes. = 1700s = Portrait of King Louis XIV in high heels Modern high heels were brought to Europe by emissaries of Abbas the Great in the early 17th century. Men wore them to imply their upper-class status; only someone who did not have to work could afford, both financially and practically, to wear such extravagant shoes. Royalty such as King Louis XIV wore heels to impart status. As the shoes caught on, and other members of society began donning high heels, elite members ordered their heels to be made even higher to distinguish themselves from lower classes.Wade, Lisa. \\"From Manly to Sexy: The History of the High Heel\\" The Society Pages. 5 Feb 2013. Authorities even began regulating the length of a high heel's point according to social rank. Klaus Carl includes these lengths in his book Shoes: \\"¬Ω inch for commoners, 1 inch for the bourgeois, 1 and ¬Ω inches for knights, 2 inches for nobles, and 2 and ¬Ω inches for princes.\\"‚ÄùCarl, Klaus. Shoes. New York, Parkstone International, 2011. EbscoHost. As women took to appropriating this style, the heels‚Äô width changed in another fundamental way. Men wore thick heels, while women wore thin ones. Then, when Enlightenment ideals such as science, nature, and logic took hold of many European societies, men gradually stopped wearing heels. After the French Revolution in the late 1780s, heels, femininity, and superficiality all became intertwined. In this way, heels became much more associated with a woman's supposed sense of impracticality and extravagance. Typical 18th-century shoe The design of the high French heels from the late 1600s to around the 1720s placed body weight on the ball of the foot, and were decorated with lace or braided fabric (pictured). From the 1730s-1740s, wide heels with an upturned toe and a buckle fastening became popular. The 1750s and 1760s introduced a skinnier, higher heel. The 1790s continued this trend, but added combinations of color. Additionally, throughout all of these decades, there was no difference between the right and left shoe.Blanco F Jos√©, et al., editors. Clothing and Fashion : American Fashion from Head to Toe. Santa Barbara, California, ABC-CLIO, an Imprint of ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2016. Print. In Britain in 1770, an act was introduced into the parliament which would have applied the same penalties as witchcraft to the use of high heels and other cosmetic devices. = 1800s = 1850s sewing machine Heels went out of fashion starting around 1810, and then in 1860 they returned at about two and a half inches. The Pinet heel and the Cromwell heel were both introduced during this time.Shawcross, Rebecca. \\"High Heels.\\" The Berg Companion to Fashion. Ed. Valarie Steele. Oxford: Bloomsbury Academic, 2010. Web. Their production was also increased with the invention and eventual mass production of the sewing machine around the 1850s. With sewing machines, yields increased as machines could quickly and cheaply \\"position[n] the heel, stitc[h] the upper, and attac[h] the upper to the sole.\\" This is also a prime example of how the popularity of heels interacts with the culture and technology of the time. = 1900s = World War II ‚Äì poster of pin-up girl (Betty Grable) in high heels With the 1900s bringing two devastating world wars, many countries set wartime regulations for rationing almost all aspects of life. This included materials previously used for making heels, such as silk, rubber, or leather; these began to be replaced with cork and wooden soles.Stabb, Jo Ann. \\"The Early 20th Century Through World War II\\" Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe, edited by Jose Blanco, vol. 3 ABC-CLIO, pp. 330-332. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Another one of the numerous outcomes of these wars was an increase in international relations, and a more proliferate sharing of fashion through photography and films, which helped spread high heel fashion as well. Examples of this were the brown and white pumps with cutouts or ankle straps combined with an open toe. Their practicality yet professional look appealed to the new, fast-paced lifestyle of many women. Meanwhile, World War II led to the popularization of pin-up girl posters, which men would often hang in their bunks while at war. Almost all of these girls were pictured wearing high heels, leading to an increase in the relationship between high heels and female sexuality. The tall, skinny stiletto heel was invented in 1950, strengthening the relationship between women, sexuality, and appearance. There was a weakening of the stiletto style during both the late 1960s through early 1970s and also 1990s when block heels were more prominent, followed by a revival in the 2000s. = 21st century = The intricate and complex history of high heels has led to a variety of cultural thoughts and lenses through which people view them today. Firstly, it is very exclusively gendered in the sense that few men wear high heels in present times. Secondly, magazines like Playboy, as well as other media sources portraying women in a sexual way, often do so using high heels. Paul Morris, a psychology researcher at the University of Portsmouth, argues that high heels accentuate \\"sex specific aspects of female gait\\", artificially increasing a woman's femininity. Respectively, the arching of a woman's back facilitated by wearing high heels signals a woman's willingness to be courted by a man. Keeping this sexual undercurrent in mind, heels are considered fashionable for women in most cases. It could be semi-formal with a \\"button down silk blouse‚Ä¶jeans and high heels.\\"\\"Women's Dress and Fashion, 1980-Present\\" Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe, edited by Jose Blanco, vol. 4 ABC-CLIO, pp. 321-325. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Or, it could be formal with a dress or pants suit. Finally, 20th and 21st century cultural values have dictated that high heels are the norm in professional settings for a woman. Some researchers argue that high heels have even become part of the female workplace uniform, and operate in a much larger and complex set of display rules. High heels are considered to pose a dilemma to women as they bring them psychosexual benefits but are detrimental to their health. The 21st century has introduced a broad spectrum and variety of styles, ranging from height and width of heel, to design and color of the shoe.  Types  Girl wearing high heeled shoe with fur on top. *Stacked heel ‚Äì usually layers of leather 5 mm thick stacked together and trimmed to match the shape of the heel. These are commonly known as block heels. *Continental heel ‚Äì 7.5 mm, with the upper part of the chest of the heel spreading towards the center of the shoe. *Setback heel ‚Äì similar to the continental heel, but the surface of the back of the heel is straight, forming a right angle. *Cuban heel ‚Äì similar to the continental heel, but not curved, generally medium height *Pantaloon heel ‚Äì \\"similar to pantaloon pants: the top lift part of the heel is spread out as it extends to the bottom part of the heel, and the waistline of the heel curves inward naturally.\\" *Angle heel ‚Äì \\"the surface of the base of the heel is straight until reaching the waistline, and it looks like the shape of the Korean letter ¬¨\\" *Pinet heel ‚Äì straight and skinny *Cromwell shoe ‚Äì based on Oliver Cromwell with heel up to . *Bar style ‚Äì had jewelry or other decorative aspects to go along with flapper culture. *New Look in 1947 ‚Äì a slim, elegant heel, newly created by putting steel in the heel.

In the early years, leather and cowhide was preferred. As civilizations progressed, silk and patent leather were introduced, while cork and wood were utilized as cheap resources in times of war. After the World Wars and the increase in production of steel, the actual heel was a piece of steel wrapped in some kind of material. This has enabled designers to make heels taller and skinnier without them snapping.Schwartz, Jessica. \\"Stiletto Heels.\\" Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe, edited by Jose Blanco, vol. 4: The Postwar Period into the 21st century, ABC-CLIO, pp. 281-282. Gale Virtual Reference Library. The soles below the ball of the foot of Ballroom shoes can also be made of materials like smooth leather, suede, or plastic.  Health impacts  Diagram of an Achilles-tendon = Injury and pain = Wearing high-heeled shoes is strongly associated with injury, including injury requiring hospital care. There is evidence that high-heel-wearers fall more often, especially with heels higher than 2.5 cm, even if they were not wearing high heels at the time of the fall. Wearing high heels is also associated with musculoskeletal pain, specifically pain in the paraspinal muscles (muscles running up the back along the spine) and specifically with heel pain and plantar calluses (only women tested). A 2001 survey conducted by researchers from Pennsylvania State University using 200 women found that 58% of women complained of lower back pain when wearing heels and 55% of women said they felt the worst overall back pain when wearing the highest heel. The researchers explained that as heel height increases, the body is forced to take on an unnatural posture to maintain its center of gravity. This changed position places more pressure and tension on the lower lumbar spine which explains why the women complained of severe back pain at a higher heel length. In a 1992 study, researchers from the University of California, Davis and Thomas Jefferson University wanted to investigate the effects of increased heel height on foot pressure using forty- five female participants walking across a pressure plate in various heel heights. A Biokinetics software was used to analyze the exact pressure locations on and along each participants' foot. The researchers were able to conclude that an increase in heel height lead to an increase in pressure beneath each of the Metatarsal bones of the foot. Additionally, they found that the highest heel heights caused constant pressure that could not be evenly dispersed across the foot. Plantar flexion of the foot in High Heels In a 2012 study, Kai-Yu Ho, Mark Blanchette and Christopher Powers, wanted to determine if heel height increased patellofemoral joint stress during walking. The patellofemoral joint refers to junction where the femur and patella meet. The study consisted of eleven participants wearing tracking and reflective markers as they walked across a 10-meter force plated walkway in low, medium and high heels. The study showed that as the height of the heel increased, the ball of the foot experienced an increase in pressure resulting in increased discomfort levels and peak patellofemoral joint stress. The researchers also mentioned that the long term usage of high heels would lead to repetitive overstress of the joint which would result in an increase in pain and eventually, patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis and Patellofemoral pain syndrome. In a 2012 study, researchers examined the risk long time high heel wearers would have in regards to calf Muscle fascicle length and strain. The control group consisted of women who wore heels for less than ten hours weekly and the experimental group consisted of women who wore heels for a minimum of forty hours weekly for at least two years. The experimental group was told to walk down a walkway barefoot and in heels while the control group walked down barefoot as cameras recorded their movements to calculate muscle fascicle lengths. The data showed that wearing heels shortened the length of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle fascicles in the calf significantly as well as increasing stiffness in the Achilles Tendon. The experimental group also demonstrated a larger amount of strain on the muscle fascicles while walking in heels because of the flexed position the foot is forced into. The researchers were able to estimate that when wearing heels, the estimated fascicle strains were approximately three times higher and the fascicle strain rate was approximately six times higher. Additionally, they were able to conclude that the long term usage of high heels can increase the risk of injuries such as strain along with discomfort and muscle fatigue. = Bunions = High-heeled shoes almost always have pointed toeboxes which do not fit around the toes, but displace them from their natural position. Wearing high- heeled shoes is associated with developing bunions, a deformity of the foot. = Balance control of the body = In 2016, scientists from the Department of Physical Therapy in the Sahmyook University in Korea conducted a study to examine the effects of increased heel height and gait velocity on balance control. Balance control refers to the ability of the body to maintain itself along the line of the center of gravity within a base of support. This must be achieved with minimal postural sway velocity which is the horizontal movement of a body trying to maintain balance when standing still. Wearing high heels narrows the base of support that the body has in order to avoid falling and also restricts the area within which the body must sway. In this study, the participants were told to wear either a low or high heel and walk at a low and high speed on a treadmill. As a result of this experiment, the researchers were able to conclude that as heel height increased, the sway velocity of the bodies increased which also modified the position of the knee joint. Muscles have to realign the entire body especially the hips along the line of gravity. As the weight of the body shifted forward, the hips were taken out of alignment and the knee joints experienced stress in order to adjust to the shift. = Postural effects = Spinal Column Curvature In a 2016 study from the Sahmyook University in Korea, researchers wanted to investigate the effects of high heels on the activation of muscles in the cervical and lumbar portions of the spine which refers to the neck and lower back. Thirteen women were recruited to walk down a walkway in three different testing conditions: barefoot, in 4 cm heels and in 10 cm heels. Surface electrodes were placed on the muscle mass of the women's spines as well as their feet to measure the electrical activity of muscles at different points of movement. The results of the study indicated an increase in both cervical and lumbar muscle activation as heel height increased. The cervical spine, the neck, assists in maintaining head stability and postural control in the body. The usage of high heels shifts the body's center of mass which forces the spine to adjust itself in order to maintain balance. The researchers mentioned that over time these results would increase local muscle fatigue that could lead to muscle swelling, decreased muscle movement and even tissue deformation. = Vein swelling = Further research reveals that another possible consequence of wearing high heels is an increase of pressure in one's veins. Experiments have proven that the higher the heel, the \\"higher [the] venous pressure in the leg.\\" This means that after repeated use of high heels, varicose veins and other undesirable symptoms are much more likely to appear in the legs. Other research supports these two claims when arguing that wearing high heels can lead to numerous long term effects, including accidental trauma to multiple areas of the body.  Legislation  In Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, heels over 2 inches high with less than one square inch of bearing surface can be worn only with a permit. It has been argued that high heels in the workplace should be subject to a health and safety assessment.  Feminism  High heels can have the effect of sexualizing the wearer. Research shows that heels draw attention to long legs and small feet. Some argue that \\"high-heeled shoes, perhaps more than any other item of clothing, are seen as the ultimate symbol of being a woman.\\" High heels often play a key role in emphasizing a wearer's, most commonly a woman's, arched back and extended buttocks. This \\"natural courting pose\\" sexualizes the wearer, and can turn them into objects subjected to the male gaze. This research highlights the emphasis heels place on the appearance of the wearer, instead of their more valuable internal traits such as intelligence, creativity, or strength. It has not been popular for men to wear high heels since the late 18th century. Some men see the cultural norm, which often mandates that women must wear heels to look professional, as completely unproblematic. However, women report that they are often painful to walk in, and commonly result in negative side effects to joints and veins after prolonged use. At the feminist Miss America protest in 1968, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"freedom trash can.\\" These included high-heels, which were among items the protestors called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. In 2015, a group of women were turned away from a film premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in France for wearing flat shoes, including a woman physically unable to wear heels due to an operation on one of her feet. The women complained that this was a sexist policy which forced women into a stereotyped appearance; festival organisers later responded that there was no official policy on footwear and stated that they would remind red-carpet officials of this. = Dress codes = Some dress codes require women to wear high heels, and some medical organizations have called for a ban on such dress codes. There have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies. Laws regarding dress codes that require women to wear high heels in the workplace vary. In the UK in 2016 temporary receptionist Nicola Thorp was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code of firm Portico. Thorp launched an online petition calling for the UK government to \\"make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work\\". Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; by this time the company had already changed its terms of employment. The petition was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was \\"adequate\\". Existing legislation allows women to be required to wear high heels, but only if it is considered a job requirement and men in the same job are required to dress to an \\"equivalent level of smartness\\". In April 2017 the Canadian province of British Columbia amended workplace legislation to prevent employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. Other Canadian provinces followed suit. The Philippines forbade companies from mandating that female employees wear high heels at work in September 2017. The #KuToo campaign in Japan collected over 150,000 signatures on a petition for a ban on mandatory high heels. The government said that they had no plans to change. Japan's labor minister commented that high heels are \\"necessary and appropriate\\" for women.High heels at work are necessary, says Japan's labour minister The Guardian, 2019 = A Mile in Her Shoes = A Mile in Her Shoes: men walk a mile in high heels to support domestic violence victims A Mile in Her Shoes is a march in which men wear red high heels and walk a mile in protest of domestic violence. Some academics have suggested that by wearing high heels for such a brief period of time, and making a point of acting like they do not know how to walk properly in them, these men are reinforcing the stereotype that only women can or should wear high heels.  Children  Children's high- heeled mary janes for sale in Fuzhou High heels are marketed to children, and some schools encourage children to wear them. 18% of injuries from wearing high heels were in children, and 4% in under-tens, in a 2002‚Äì2012 US survey. A 2016 medical review on high-heeled shoes expressed concern about children's use of high heels. A nine-year old is about half an adult's height, and a toddler about a quarter; so, relative to body height, a 2-inch (5 cm) heel on an adult would be a one-inch heel on the nine-year-old, and a half-inch heel on the toddler, though whether this translates to comparable health harms is not known.  Dancing  = Styles of dance that use heels = Standard ballroom tango shoes Many styles of dance are performed in heels. Ballroom dancing shoes are specific to the style of dance being performed. International Standard ballroom shoes for women are closed-toed shoes with a sturdy 2- to 2.5-inch heel because steps are performed using the heel of the foot. International Latin and American Rhythm shoes are open-toed, strapped heels that are an average of 2.5 to 3 inches in height. These shoes have the least sturdy heel because International Latin and American Rhythm styles are performed on the ball of the foot. This style of shoe is designed with a flexible sole to allow pointed feet. Lastly, American Smooth shoes are closed- toed, flexible-soled shoes that range in heel height from 2 to 2.5 inches. A non-traditional ballroom dance that uses heels is the Argentine tango. While dancing the Argentine tango, women often wear pointed heels ranging in height from 2 to 4 inches. More advanced dancers typically choose higher heels. The heels change the overall stance of the woman by tilting the hips forward, making the stomach flatter and pushing the buttocks out. The heels also cause unsteadiness that forces women to dance on their toes and lean on their partner, which adds to the fluidity of the movements. A modern style of dance called heels choreography or stiletto dance specializes in choreography that blends the styles of jazz, hip-hop and burlesque with the fusion of vogue movements and is performed using stilettos or high heels. Dancers such as Yanis Marshall specialize in dancing with high heels. = Injuries = Some dance-related injuries are attributable to the use of heels. In particular, shoes with a narrow space for the toes can squeeze tightly enough to cause foot deformity. Dancers can add cushioning to the soles of their dancing shoes or inserts to ease the pain during dancing.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 148. is a village and civil parish in the Forest of Dean of west Gloucestershire, England, adjoining the Welsh border. Tidenham is bounded by the River Wye (which forms the Welsh border) to the west and the River Severn to the south. Offa's Dyke runs through the western part of the parish, terminating at Sedbury cliff above the River Severn. Geography The parish includes the villages of Tidenham, Beachley, Boughspring, Sedbury, Tutshill and Woodcroft, and according to the United Kingdom Census 2001 had a population of 5,316, increasing to 5,486 at the 2011 census. At one time it included the now-abandoned village of Lancaut. Tidenham, Beachley and Woolaston were added to Gloucestershire by the first Act of Union of England and Wales in 1536; previously they had been part of the Marcher lordship of Striguil. The stretch of the Wye Valley lying within the parish includes several popular rock climbing cliffs at Wintour's Leap near Woodcroft and the Devil's Pulpit, a famous rock formation and viewpoint overlooking Tintern Abbey. The parish also contains Tidenham Chase - the largest remaining fragment of lowland heathland in Gloucestershire. Also notable is the former Dayhouse Quarry which, after providing traffic for the remaining fragment of the former railway to Monmouth, is now home to the National Diving and Activity Centre. The railway has been the centre of several attempts to re- open it, but the overgrown track tells the result of these efforts to restore Tidenham station quite effectively. It ran through Tintern up the Wye Valley, and joined the mainline near Tidenham. Miss Grace's Lane is a natural cave system approximately long and is the second-longest cave in the Forest of Dean area. Located as it is between the Wye and Severn the area has always been important as a site for crossing these rivers. Historically ferries crossed the River Severn from Beachley to Aust and now this route is followed by the Severn Bridge one of whose piers stands on the Beachley peninsula although the bridge itself begins in Wales. From Roman times the River Wye has been bridged between Tutshill and Chepstow. History The village, once known as Dyddanhamme, is one of the most heavily documented Saxon villages in Britain and has been home to a grand manor of some kind since at least the 6th century AD. The Saxon structure was owned by the Abbott of Bath, who retained some of the documents on what was then an important location until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The current Tidenham Manor is of Georgian design, overlooking the river and conveniently located adjacent to the Norman parish church. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. The population and area of the ward is identical to the parish quoted above. Railways The area is served by Chepstow railway station on the Gloucester to Newport Line. =Wye Valley Railway (currently closed)= The area was previously served by Tidenham railway station on the Wye Valley Railway. The scenic line which ran from Chepstow via Tintern to Monmouth Troy was closed in 1959.

It features fourfold rotational symmetry. If the original sphere to be everted has its outer surface colored green and its inner surface colored red, then when the sphere is transformed through homotopy into a Morin surface, half of the outwardly visible Morin surface will be green, and half red: Image:MorinSurfaceAsSphere'sInsideVersusOutside.PNG Half of a Morin surface corresponds to the exterior (green) of the sphere to which it is homeomorphic, and the other symmetric half to the interior (red). Then, rotating the surface 90¬∞ around its axis of symmetry will exchange its colors, i.e. will exchange the inner-outer polarity of the orientable surface, so that retracing the steps of the homotopy at exactly the same position back to the original sphere after having so rotated the Morin surface will yield a sphere whose outer surface is red and whose inner surface is green: a sphere which has been turned inside out.

Structure of the Morin surface The Morin surface can be separated into four congruent quarter sections. These sections may be here called section East, section South, section West, and section North, or -- respectively -- section 0, section 1, section 2, and section 3. Image:MorinSurfaceSectionEast.PNG ::Section East of the Morin surface. The Morin surface has a quadruple point through which passes its axis of symmetry. This quadruple point is the starting point and the end point of six lines of double points. Each of the quarter sections is bounded by three of these lines of double points, so that each quarter section is homeomorphic to a triangle. Section East is now shown schematically: 300px The diagram shows section East bounded by three loops: ABCDA, AEFGA, and AHIJA. The third loop, AHIJA, is a line of double points where section East intersects with itself. Loop ABCDA is only a line of double points when section East is joined to section West, and loop AEFGA is only a line of double points when section East is joined to section South. Point is the quadruple point which is actually the overlapping of four different points: A0, A1, A2, A3. This is how section East is joined to the other sections: let each of its bounding loops be specified by an ordered quintuple of points, then : (A_1, B, C, D, A_3) = (A_1, D, C, B, A_3) : (A_2, E, F, G, A_3) = (A_2, H', I', J', A_3) : (A_1, H, I, J, A_2) = (A_1, E, F, G, A_2) where unprimed points belong to section 0 (East), primed points belong to section 1 (South), double-primed points belong to section 2 (West), and triple-primed points belong to section 3 (North). The remaining three loops connect sections as follows: : (A_2, B', C', D', A_0) = (A_2, D, C, B, A_0) : (A_3, E', F', G', A_0) = (A_3, H, I, J, A_0) : (A_0, E, F, G, A_1) = (A_0, H', I, J, A_1).

The bones, jars, shells, and other artifacts and fossils were found in the Bolobok Rock Shelter Cave Archaeological Site, which has been declared as an Important Cultural Treasure by the government in 2017. Much of the Bongao area was the center of Bajau culture and arts for hundreds of years. By the 14th century, Muslim missionaries from Arabia arrived and established the first ever mosque in the Philippines. The area was heavily converted to Islam, especially when the Sultanate of Sulu in nearby Sulu province was founded. The province of Tawi- tawi was never officially controlled directly by the Spanish as the Sultanate of Sulu was in a perpetual war with Spain, resulting to the preservation of its Muslim and Bajau cultures. However, the sultanate waned and was captured by Spain, only to be handed to American forces after a few years. Sibutu remained under Spanish rule until 1900. Before the armed rebellion of the MNLF in the early 1970s, Bongao was merely a backwater village ruled by the prominent noble Halun family, who used to own about three-quarters of the island. The capital of the province was Batu-Batu (in Panglima Sugala) in the mainland situated in a cove with deep waters suited for anchors of the Philippine Navy. At the height of the armed rebellion and fearing that the provincial capitol might be overrun, the government transferred it to Bongao. The white-washed, Taj Mahal-inspired provincial capitol building is located on a hill overlooking the bay and the whole town to the North of the Island against the backdrop of Mount Kabugan and the famous Bud Bongao (Bongao Peak). The transfer of the seat of government ushered the rapid development of the island as the southernmost center of commerce and trade. Suddenly, the population swelled as individuals (and their families) who are in government service moved to the town. Demographics Bongao poblacion Culture Today, Bongao is a minuscule cosmopolitan site that is becoming a model of multicultural society. In downtown Bongao, there are mosques for the majority Muslim population, a Catholic church, a church for Protestant inhabitants, and a Chinese temple. The municipality is the home of the Balobok Rock Shelter- Cave Archaeological Site, which carbon dates the existence of humans on Tawi- Tawi for 5,000-8,000 years, making it one of the earliest human settlement site in Southeast Asia. The entire archaeological site has been declared as an Important Cultural Property by the National Government in 2017. Economy The main thoroughfare is Datu Halun Street, where the Town Hall is situated. Poblacion is the commercial hub. Most of the businesses here are owned by local people. Due to its relative peace and order situation, recent migrant Chinese from Zamboanga have also open business. Banks operating in Bongao include Land Bank of the Philippines, Philippine National Bank, and Metrobank. Quedancor, a government owned investment company, has recently opened business. The Midway Plaza Mall, a new 2-storey retail center, is the first shopping mall in Tawi-tawi opened in April 2010. Education Bongao is home to the Mindanao State University - Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and Oceanography (MSU-TCTO), Tawi-Tawi Regional Agricultural College (TRAC), Mahardika Institute of Technology (MIT), Abubakar Learning Center Foundation College (ALC), Tawi-Tawi School of Midwifery (TTSM). The first two are government owned state colleges, while the last three are privately owned. There are several secondary high schools in Tawi-Tawi such as the MSU TCTO - Science High School, MSU TCTO Preparatory High School, Tawi-Tawi School of Arts and Trade, Notre Dame of Bongao, and Tawi-Tawi School of Fisheries (TTSF).

Most of them have found a job in neighboring country like Malaysia. Tend to work as a construction workers and fisherman. Mapun Day Mapun Foundation Day is celebrated by the Jama Mapun every September 5. This week-long celebration starts on September 1, with a parade and then a short program held in Lupa Pula Central School. Various competitions are held during Mapun Day, which includes singing competitions (in English, Tausug, and Pullun Mapun), dance showdowns (modern dance, folk dance, pangalay, which is a native dance, and lunsay, which is a dance performed during weddings), Azaan competition, Tarasul iban Daman (Mapun's version of declamation and oration), and Leleng, to name a few. Each Barangay has their own representatives in the various events. However, the most popular is the \\"Budjang Mapun\\", which is a beauty contest. Each barangay has its own contestant in this event. The winner of the search for \\"Budjang Mapun\\" is usually sent to Bongao as Mapun's representative in Budjang Tawi- Tawi, a similar beauty search held in Bongao every Province Day. Every municipality in Tawi-Tawi has its own contestant. Economy Main source of income from this province are farming and fishing. In a bid to advance competitiveness of Tawi-Tawi in farming industry, this province supplies large companies when it comes on coconut plantation mainly \\"COPRA\\". 80% of the land consist of coconut trees, quarterly harvested and to be traded and refined in other places, like Palawan and Zamboanga City. Rice fields are not known in this area due to lack of water irrigation projects, rice is imported locally from Palawan and Zamboanga City and mostly from Malaysia. Most of the locals use cassava as base on their daily meal.

The hook at the top allows these to be suspended and the cop is built up below the disk-shaped whorl in a conical shape. Spindle with cotton yarn, without whorl, representing the \\"spindle- shape\\". A modern Turkish spindle is an example of a low-whorl suspended spindle where the whorl is made up of interlocking arms. Here the cop is wound around the arms to form a ball. Spinning with a suspended spindle (below) and distaff (above) A spindle is a straight spike usually made from wood used for spinning, twisting fibers such as wool, flax, hemp, cotton into yarn. It is often weighted at either the bottom, middle, or top, commonly by a disc or spherical object called a whorl; many spindles, however, are weighted simply by thickening their shape towards the bottom, e.g. Orenburg and French spindles. The spindle may also have a hook, groove, or notch at the top to guide the yarn. Spindles come in many different sizes and weights depending on the thickness of the yarn one desires to spin. History The origin of the first wooden spindle is lost to history because the materials did not survive. Whorl-weighted spindles date back at least to Neolithic times; spindle whorls have been found in archaeological digs around the world. A spindle is also part of traditional spinning wheels where it is horizontal, such as the Indian charkha and the great or walking wheel. In industrial yarn production, spindles are used as well; see spinning jenny, spinning mule and ring spinning. The wood traditionally favoured for making spindles was that of Euonymus europaeus, from which derives the traditional English name spindle bush.Clapham, A. R. (1975). The Oxford Book of Trees. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p.31.  Hand spindles  Modern hand spindles fall into three basic categories: suspended spindles, supported spindles and grasped spindles.Kennedy, Norman. (2012). Spin Flax & Cotton: Traditional Techniques with Norman Kennedy. Interweave Press. 1hr 11 min Supported and suspended spindles are normally held vertically, grasped spindles may be held vertically, horizontally or at an angle depending on the tradition. Suspended spindles are so named because they are suspended to swing from the yarn after rotation has been started. Drop Spindles are a popular type of suspended spindle and get their name because the spindle is allowed to drop down while the thread is formed, allowing for a greater length of yarn to be spun before winding on. Suspended spindles also permit the spinner to move around while spinning, going about their day. However, there are practical limits to their size/weight. Most supported spindles continue to rest with the tip on one's thigh, on the ground, on a table, or in a small bowl while rotating. Supported spindles come in a great variety of sizes, such as the very large, ~30\\" Navajo spindle, the small, extremely fast, metal takli for spinning cotton, and the tiniest Orenburg spindles (~20 cm, 15gm) for spinning gossamer lace yarns. Grasped spindles are also known as hand spindles, in the hand spindles, in hand spindles and twiddled spindles; there appears no consensus on nomenclature for this category of spindles though there have been various attempts at creating an agreed nomenclature including dividing this category of spindles into two, such as Crowfoot's attempts to define the difference between grasped and in hand spindles or merging this category into others, such as Franquemont's approach of classing them as supported spindles. Grasped spindles remain held in the hand using finger or wrist movements to turn the spindle. French spindles are \\"twiddled\\" between the fingers of one hand while some types of Romanian spindles are grasped in the fist and turned through rotation of the wrist. While spindle types are divided into these three main categories, some traditional spinning styles employ multiple or blended techniques. For example the Akha spindle, a short spindle with a large centre- whorl disc, is supported by the hand of the spinner during drafting of cotton fibre, but during the adding of extra twist to stabilize the yarn, the spindle is dropped to rest on the yarn. A familiar sight from history books is a spindle used in conjunction with a distaff, an upright stick with a large quantity of loose fibre wound around it, to be easily accessed. There are many other methods for controlling the pre-spun fibre, such as coiling it around one's lower arm, or through a bracelet, or wrapping it loosely around a yarn braid hanging from one's wrist. Another way spindles are categorised is by the location of the whorl. The whorl, where present, may be located near the top, bottom or centre of the spindle. For example a top-whorl drop spindle will have the whorl located near the top of the shaft underneath a hook that allows the spindle to suspend as it is being spun. The newly spun yarn is wound below the whorl and forms a ‚Äòcop‚Äô. Depending on the location of the whorl and style of the spindle, the cop can be conical, football or ball shaped and it can be wound above, below or over the whorl. A grasped spindle being used with a distaff. Spindles can also be used for plying: intertwining two or more single strands of yarn together in order to create a stronger, more balanced, more durable yarn.  Anatomy  While hand spindles vary, there are some similarities in the parts that make up a spindle. = Shaft = Spindle shafts can be made out of a variety of materials such as wood, metal, bone or plastic. They may have very little shaping or be dramatically shaped enough to form part of the whorl. Shafts may be left plain or decorated with painting or carving. The shaft is how the spinner inserts twist through turning it between the fingers or rolling it between the hand and another part of their anatomy, such as their thigh. The thickness of the shaft affects how fast the spindles spins with narrower shafts contributing to a faster spinning spindle. Many spindles will have a point at the top of the shaft to fix the thread to. Options include a simple length of shaft to tie the thread around, a shaped notch or bulb, or a hook. = Whorl = A whorl is a weight that is added to many types of spindles and can be made out of a large variety of materials including wood, metal, glass, plastic, stone, clay or bone. Whorls may be decorated or left plain, and they may be affixed permanently to the shaft or they may be removable. Whorl shapes vary greatly and can include ball-shaped, disk-shaped and cross shaped whorls. The shape and mass distribution of the whorl affects the momentum it gives to the spindle while it is spinning. For example a centre weighted whorl will spin very fast and short, while a rim- weighted disk-shaped whorl will spin longer and slower. Whorls can be located near the top, middle or bottom of the spindle shaft. Whorl location can affect the stability of the spindle, with bottom whorl spindles being considered more stable. = Cop = The cop is not initially an intrinsic part of the spindle; however, as it is formed it plays a part in the spindle anatomy. Once a length of yarn or thread is spun it is wound around the spindle shaft or whorl to form a cop or a ball. As more yarn or thread is spun this makes the spindle heavier and more center-weighted, which has an effect on the momentum of the spindle. The overall shape of the cop and the skill in winding it also has an impact on how the spindle spins and how much thread or yarn can be stored on a spindle before it is \\"full\\". Cops can be wound in a ball, cone or football shape. Cultural references The spindle is closely associated with many goddesses, including the Germanic Holda, Norse Frigg and Freya, Egyptian Isis, Greek Artemis and Athena. It is often connected with fate, as the Greek Fates and the Norse Norns work with yarns that represent lives. Because the spinning wheel was not in common use before the 16th century in Europe, the older stories are certainly referring to hand spinning done on a spindle. Chief among these is the French fairy tale The Sleeping Beauty, where the princess is erroneously shown to prick her hand on some part of a spinning wheel in modern illustrations, rather than a spindle. Types =Supported spindles= Supported spindles spin on surfaces such as bowls that are usually ceramic or wooden. This type of spindle gives the user more control of the weight of the yarn. The various types of supported spindles range due to the difference in styles of spinning and yarn weight. Navajo spindles have longer shafts that should reach from the ground to the top of the thigh. The spun yarn is wound above the whorl. In Icelandic Viking times, the people used a high whorl lap spindle to spin wool into yarn. The high whorl lap spindle has a whorl on top with a hook on the top and a long shaft like other supported spindles. Unlike the Navajo spindle, however, the spun yarn is wrapped around the lower end of the spindle. The roving is prepped first by drafting it before the wool is spun into yarn. The separation between the drafting and spinning creates a softer yarn. Since it is a supported spindle, the yarn is less strained, which also makes the yarn soft.A Handspindle Treasury =Bottom whorl drop spindles= A typical bottom whorl spindle has the spun single ply yarn above the whorl instead of below it like top whorl drop spindles. Bottom whorl spindles are the preferred spindle for plying yarn. Turkish drop spindles have a low whorl spindle that have two arms that intersect to make a cross. Like other drop spindles it is spun and then it hangs while the wool is being drafted and the twist travels up the wool. When winding the spun yarn on to the arms it usually is put over and under the arms on the spindle. Even though it turns much more slowly than winding onto a regular spindle it creates a center pull ball of yarn. =Top whorl drop spindles= Top whorl spindles commonly have a disc on the top of the shaft with a hook at the top.

The islands had been at the crossroads of the sea trade route and were a traditional enclave of the Bajau and Sama people who for centuries had peacefully lived off fishing and trading. The Kadatuan and Kasalipan (Salip/ arabic; Sharif) of Sitangkai and Sibutu were descended from the royalties of Sulu, Sabah, and Sarawak. Historical personalities such as the Datu Iskandar of Sibutu and the Datu Halon of Sitangkai was descended from the Datu Baginda Putih, Datu Baginda Hitam, and the feared Datu Kurunding of Lahat Datu from Borneo (now part of the Malaysian and Indonesian states). In the early 1900s, a man named Lailuddin ibn Jalaluddin from the area of Nunukan, Parang, Sulu was noted to be the first Taus≈´g to settle in Sitangkai, bringing with him his clan, wealth, and slaves. Together with his sons and nephews, they settled, intermarried, and made alliances with the local traditional leaders and inhabitants. During World War II, Sitangkai and Sibutu, being closer to British Borneo, was targeted by patrols and occasional raids by Japanese Imperial soldiers. Sitangkai nowadays is still a jump off port for traditional traders from Sulu, Zamboanga, mainland Tawi-Tawi going to Sabah and Borneo. The southernmost flagpole in the Philippines at Panguan Island. Present day Sitangkai was created as a municipality on August 26, 1959, by virtue of Executive Order No. 355 of President Carlos P. Garcia. On October 21, 2006, with the ratification of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 197, 16 of its 25 barangays were transferred to the newly created municipality of Sibutu, all of which are located on Sibutu Island. Most of the residents of present day Sitangkai are settlers from Sulu, Zamboanga, and the Visayas, brought over the years and registered by subsequent competing politicians to add votes for elections. This unjust settling policy has continued unabated over the past decades, destroying the natural demographics of Sitangkai and adjoining islands, thereby affecting the natural resources of the area and disenfranchising the original peaceful Bajau and Sama inhabitants who moved to Zamboanga or Sabah, Malaysia or fled to far away pondohans (shallow sandbars). Lack of opportunities, facilities, the proliferation of illegal arms, drug addiction, and piracy are problems facing Sitangkai today.

Therefore, Tandubas means a place of landing, referring to a group of Malaysian traders who sailed across many islands and landed on an island what is now Tandubas Island. Seeing the abundance of resources to sustain their living, this group of Malaysian traders finally decided to settle on that island and named it as Tanjung Bas. For many years, the island had been named as Tanjung Bas. The Malaysian word Tanjung has its equivalent in Sama dialect which is Tandu. The name Tanjungbas has been changed by the natives to Tandubas, a name that was used from generation to generation. Geography The Municipality of Tandubas is located in the north-eastern part of the province of Tawi-Tawi. It is bounded in the north by Languyan Municipality and Sulu Sea; south by Celebes Sea; east by Municipality of South Ubian: and west by Municipality of Sapa-Sapa. The municipality is approximately away from the Municipality of Bongao, the capital town of Tawi-Tawi. From Bongao it is accessible by water transportation. Travel time from the port of Bongao to the Municipality of Tandubas takes about five (5) hours using a motor launch with an average speed. For a speedboat or a fast craft it will only take about an hour. =Barangays= Tandubas is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. 12 barangays are located on the island of Tandubas (Tongbangkaw, Tapian, Ballak, Kakoong, Tangngah, Silantup, Butun, Kepeng, Sallangan, Tapian Sokah, Sibakloon and Sapa); 2 barangays are located on Tingungun Island (Kalang-kalang and Salamat); 1 barangay is located at Naungan Island (barangay Naungan); 2 barangays are located on Tandubato island (Lahay-Lahay and Tandubato); 2 barangays are located on Tawitawi Island (Himba and Baliongan), and 1 barangay located on Taruk Island (Barangay Taruk). =Climate= History Tandubas had been a part of the Sultanate of Sulu prior to the creation of Sulu as a province under the Republic of the Philippines. When the province of Sulu was created, Tandubas was one of the Districts, an administrative sub-division of the then Department of Education under the Division of Sulu. By virtue of Executive Order No. 355, dated July 1, 1958, Tandubas was converted to a Municipality under the Province of Sulu, covering areas now under the municipality of Sapa-Sapa, the municipality of Languyan, an area in the mainland of Tawi-Tawi. When the Province of Tawi-Tawi was created by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 302, dated September 27, 1973, the Municipality of Tandubas became one of the municipalities in the Province of Tawi-Tawi. By 2008, the municipality celebrated its Golden Anniversary. In a bid to create more local government units that comprise the Province of Tawi-Tawi, the Municipality of Sapa-Sapa was created entirely from Tandubas Municipality. Also the Municipality of Languyan was created partly out of the territorial jurisdiction of the Municipality of Tandubas, thus greatly reducing the land area of the mother municipality. This was made possible by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1086.

Presence of these formations are evident on three of the islands - Lihiman, Great Bakkungaan and Boaan Islands. The hills on these islands are mostly mud volcanoes. On Great Bakkungan Island, grey mud quietly flows from the vent in a pulsating manner accompanied by gas bubbling. On Boan Island, mud extrusion had ceased by August 2000.

Such extrusions are reported to be accompanied by mild earthquakes and evidence of extruded materials can be found high up the surrounding trees because of its explosive character. Huge amount of materials are discharged from this volcano that drainage was cut on the northern slope of the hill to direct the flow to the sea.

Retrieved on 15 February 2011. For the five islands, the Philippine government decided to create special protection zones, and within this zones, only scientific and conservation activities are allowed. In other zones, certain rules are adapted to prevent too much impact by people on the environment and the turtles. Visiting these zones is only possible with strict guidance and under supervision of the staff of the officials of the government. For a successful conservation and protection program, the support of the locals was very important. Fishing, for most of them, is the most important activity and source of income. Hunting sea turtles and collecting the turtle eggs for food, had always been a possible source for additional income. From the end of August to December, turtles come by the hundreds from the surrounding coastal waters, to lay and dig their eggs into the sand. The staff of the conservation project were able to succeed in convincing the locals the need to minimise their collecting activities. Local men, women and children, are now involved, helping with the protection activities. A possibility of 2nd otter species in the Philippines had been raised with the recording of two romps (two adults and one pup) of otters in the Turtle islands. Otters found in the island is most likely Smooth-coated otter according to otter specialists. The other species that can be found in the Philippines is the Asian small-clawed otter or locally known as dungon in Palawan. History Under the Treaty of Paris of 1898 Spain ceded to the United States \\"the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands\\".Article III of the Treaty of Paris The terms of that treaty were supplemented by the Treaty of Washington of 1900. On the basis of this cession, the United States claimed sovereignty over the Philippine Turtle Islands and the Mangsee Islands, all of which were administered by the British North Borneo Company.American Journal of International Law; Vol. 45, No. 4, Oct., 1951; The Taganak Island Lighthouse Dispute; by Assoc. Prof. Vicente Abad Santos (University of Philippines) and Lt. Col. Charles D.T. Lennhoff (U.S. Army) Responding to the claim, the United Kingdom government said there was \\"no intention...to question the title of the United States\\" to the islands. However, the UK asked \\"whether the United States Government would be willing to forgo their right to these islands, out of consideration for the fact that the North Borneo Company had during many years carried on the administration of [the islands] under the apparent belief the islands formed part of the company's territory, and as the company attached importance to being permitted to retain control over them\\".Letter dated 29 September 1905 from British Ambassador Sir Mortimer Durand to U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root Under a treaty concluded by exchange of notes dated 3 and 10 July 1907,U.S. Treaty Series 856 of 1907 the two countries agreed that the administration of the islands would continue to be carried on by the British North Borneo Company, with that arrangement to end should an international boundary treaty end it or should either government give the other government one year's notice. By a further international treaty concluded in 1930 between the United States (in respect of its then overseas territory, the Philippine Archipelago) and the United Kingdom (in respect of its then protectorate, the State of North Borneo) the two powers agreed the international boundaries between those respective territories.Convention between the United States and the United Kingdom done at Washington on 2 January 1930 In that treaty the United Kingdom unambiguously accepted that Sibuang, Boaan, Lihiman, Langaan, Great Bakkungaan, Tanganak and Banguan together called in that treaty the Turtle Islands as well as the Mangsee Islands were part of the Philippines Archipelago and therefore under U.S. sovereignty. However, by a supplemental international treaty concluded at the same time, the two powers agreed that those islands, although part of the Philippines Archipelago, would remain under the administration of the State of North Borneo's British North Borneo Company.Exchange of Notes between the United States and the United Kingdom done at Washington on 2 January 1930 The supplemental treaty provided that the British North Borneo Company would continue to administer those islands unless and until the United States government gave notice to the United Kingdom calling for administration of the islands to be transferred to the U.S. The U.S. never gave such a notice. On 4 July 1946 the Republic of the Philippines was born. It became the successor to the U.S. under the treaties of 1930. On 15 July 1946 the United Kingdom annexed the State North Borneo and, in the view of the United Kingdom, became the sovereign power with respect to what had been the State of North Borneo.The North Borneo Cession Order in Council 1946 On 19 September 1946 the Republic of the Philippines notified the United Kingdom that it wished to take over the administration of the Turtle Islands and the Mangesse Islands. The British government responded by asking the Philippine government to reconsider \\"because these islands are so far from the nearest Philippine administrative base that...it would be in the best interests of both the Philippines and North Borneo for the latter to remain responsible for the administration of the islands.\\"Letter dated 6 June 1947 of British Foreign Service officer, N.E. Dening to the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Elpidio Quirino The British agreed to the Philippine request to establish a joint committee to examine the administration of the islands. The joint committee made an inspection of the islands but ultimately on 24 September 1947 the Philippines made known its decision to press ahead with taking over the administration of the islands. Pursuant to a supplemental international agreement, the transfer of administration became effective on 16 October 1947.Exchange of Notes between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines regarding the transfer of the administration of the Turtle and Mangsee Islands to the Philippine Republic; Cmd 8320 =Taganak Lighthouse Dispute= The largest of the islands, Taganak, is near the entrance to Sandakan Bay. The lighthouse on the island, which was of practical importance to nearby North Borneo, became the subject of an international dispute known as the Taganak Lighthouse Dispute.by Ressell H. Fifeld The Diplomacy Of Southeast Asia 1945-1958; Publisher Harper & Brothers; 1958 The 1930 international treaty dealing with the transfer of administration of the Turtle Islands including Taganak contained the following provision: At the time of the transfer of the island the Philippine government rejected the UK request that the Philippines pay for the cost of the lighthouse and that they provide for its maintenance in the future. The Manila government asserted that the obligations contained in the 1930 treaty \\"presupposes naturally that the lighthouse be in working condition at the time of the transfer and that its operation is necessary and will provide some public benefit to the United States, or its successor, the Philippines\\". Manila asserted that the lighthouse had been severely damaged in the war, that it had not been in operation since its destruction, and that the Philippines did not need its service. The government was willing to lease the site for the lighthouse to North Borneo for one peso per annum, as long as the British needed and used the facility. The United Kingdom view was that the Philippines was required under the terms of the 1930 treaty concerning the Turtle Islands to maintain the lighthouse in the future. On 26 May 1948 the British Minister, Linton Foulds, in Manila wrote to the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Joaqu√≠n Miguel Elizalde, calling again on the Philippine government to fulfil its obligations under the 1930 treaty as regards paying compensation for the lighthouse and providing for its operation as it remained in a state of ruin. On 23 July 1949 the Philippines responded in the same terms as it had at the time of the transfer. The parties remained in dispute. Prof. Vicente Abad Santos of the University of the Philippines and Lt. Col. Charles D.T. Lennhoff of the U.S. army who reported on the Taganak Lighthouse Dispute in the American Journal of International Law assessed the arguments of the British and Philippine sides. They concluded that \\"the Philippine Government is justified in refusing to pay...and in refusing to provide for [the lighthouse's] maintenance\\". Today, the abandoned lighthouse tower remains at the summit of the island.

Under the executive order, a district officer was put in charge of administering the new special municipality. The following year, Executive Order 130 was signed by President Elpidio Quirino providing for regular and more usual local government structures.Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines; Executive Order No. 130, s. 1948; 21 April 1948 The Turtle Islands were constituted as the \\"municipal district of Turtle Islands\\" to be governed by article VI, chapter 64, of the Revised Administrative Code. It was provided that the provincial board of Sulu shall act as council for the municipal district of Turtle Islands. The \\"district officer of Turtle Islands\\" was given the new title of \\"municipal district mayor of the Turtle Islands\\" and the same powers and duties which pertain to such official in other municipal districts organized under the provisions of article VI, chapter 64, of the Revised Administrative Code, in addition to those prescribed under Executive Order No. 95 in 1947. =Malaysian annexation allegation controversy= In 1988, the Manila press announced that Malaysia had annexed the islands. Three days of hype, supported by news maps showing the annexation, died away when it was revealed that the \\"annexation\\" was the result of the misreading of an American naval chart by a Philippine naval officer. The officer mistook a deepwater ship route for the boundary of Malaysia's new economic zone. Demographics Taganak, Boaan, Great Bakkungaan, Lihiman and Langaan are inhabited. Baguan, an island protected for turtle nesting and the smallest island, Sibaung, are uninhabited.Sector Network Rural Development and Natural Resources Asia (SNRD Asia), Vulnerability Assessment in Turtle Islands, Tawitawi According to the 2010 census, the population of the five permanently inhabited islands is people. With a land area of only , the islands have a population density of . On the five inhabited islands the land cover in large areas is dominated by houses.Mindanao Examiner; Environment agencies tackle marine wildlife sanctuary issues in 2-day Tawi-Tawi meeting; 28 July 2009 Typical of other rural areas in the Philippines, human settlements are mixed with agriculture. The relative dominance of the settlements is mainly due to the limited land area and the resulting high population density level, which is more than four times the national average. Agriculture and aquaculture Natural land cover types in the islands are classified as wooded, mangrove, brush, grass and bare. Most of the areas on the five inhabited islands used for agriculture are planted with coconut. There is a seaweed and seagrass industry on the islands. Almost all species have some known economic value. Only those food species, when developed, are likely to be of immediate economic benefit to the local populations.

Livestock and poultry production Due to the existence of a wide tract of land for grazing and pasture, Balindong is one of the Province source for cattle and carabao and other livestock products. Inventory of livestock indicate that there exist (2002): cattle ‚Äì 145 heads, carabao ‚Äì 131 heads, goat ‚Äì 135, chicken 417, ducks ‚Äì 210. The data indicate a decreasing inventory of animals, therefore, a need to replenish the stock.

History In May 1902, during the Moro Rebellion (also known as the Moro‚ÄìAmerican War), Bayang was the site of a clash between Moro rebels and American troops that became known as the Battle of Bayang. The American troops, three infantry battalions and a battery of artillery total to some 1200 men, were led to Bayang by colonel Frank Baldwin to demand the extradition of the Moros responsible for the ambushing and killing of two American soldiers at the construction of a road from Iligan to Lake Lanao, two months earlier. When the sultan of Bayang refused, Baldwin's troops attacked and captured the nearby cotta (fortress; \\"small, castle-like structures with thick, high walls\\") of Binidayan on 2 May. They subsequently attempted to capture the cotta of Pandapatan, which resisted the artillery fire and was only subdued the next day after hand-to-hand combat between Moros and Americans. The number of Moro casualties is estimated at 300 to 400, including the sultan of Bayang and his brother. On the American side, ten soldiers were killed and some forty wounded. The cotta of Pandapatan has been preserved as a historical monument; the fallen of the Battle of Bayang are considered martyrs by Filipino Muslims.

Executive board members are personally liable for accepting any such instructions. The specific scope of an executive board's duties varies from business to business. (A group of companies may each have their own individual executive boards, for example). The president of the executive board (i.e., the CEO) and the position's role are determined by the supervisory board. German law permits, but does not require, executive board members to elect a president/CEO from among their number. There are no specific legal requirements regarding the CEO's role, or even for the title given to the holder of the CEO position, although in practice the most common title is simply Vorstandsvorsitzender, literally, \\"Vorstand chairman\\". A noticeable minority refer to their CEOs as Sprecher (lit., \\"speaker\\"), implying that the CEO is no more than primus inter pares; probably the best-known example for a company which uses this terminology is Deutsche Bank. The exact relationship between the CEO and the other executive officers depends on the company's type, how it was founded, and indeed the individual personalities of the people involved. A family business could, for example, have a strong CEO who is a member of the founding family and exercises a great deal of power over the rest of the board. In other companies, executive officers may hold themselves accountable to the executive board as a whole and not at all accountable to the CEO as an individual. The relationships among executive officers can vary too. It is common practice for board members to be senior executives with specific areas of functional responsibility. However, the law requires that they oversee the activities of their fellow officers, since they are still personally liable for any failings outside their specific departments/subdivisions. Each board member has one vote. Decisions are never escalated, when there is a lack of consensus, to the supervisory board. Executive board meetings are commonly held on a weekly basis and can last up to a whole day. Formally, the power to appoint executive officers to the board lies with the supervisory board, which can appoint officers with a two-thirds majority vote of approval, or a simple majority if multiple rounds of voting are required in order to reach a decision. Since up to 50% of the supervisory board members are delegates of the employees (or even external trade union representatives, for details see Mitbestimmung), this prevents employees from blocking the appointment of executive officers to the executive board. Executive officers have a certain degree of job security, which is partly a preventative measure aimed at ensuring that executive boards are not dominated and that they are not \\"packed\\" with hand-picked appointees. Officers are usually appointed for the maximum statutory term‚Äî5 years. Removal must be for good cause, such as serious breach of duty, and is subject to the supervisory board's veto. When an executive officer's ability to perform their duties is diminished due to old age, it is customary for them to serve out the remainder of their term but with a deputy to help perform their duties. Neither the shareholders nor the executive board can compel an officer to retire, whereas the supervisory board can. Commonly, the CEO receives between 30% and 50% greater salary than that of the other executive officers. An officer's remuneration usually comprises 65% basic salary, and 35% that is equally split between annual bonuses and benefits.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality, formerly Bumbaran, was changed to Amai Manabilang under Muslim Mindanao Act No. 316 on January 22, 2015. Etymology Bumbaran is named after the well- known Magalinday Bembaran in the Darangen, a famous Meranau (Maranao) Epic that was justifiably placed in the company of known epics of the world. The scenic beauty of the town resembles the beauty of Magalinday Bembaran. After the political efforts of Mayor James Manabilang, Bumbaran was renamed into Amai Manabilang, in honor of his own personal ancestor. Geography The municipal boundaries are defined as follows: on the east by the municipality of Wao, separated by a straight line long, drawn northward from Point 1 to Point 2 on the bank of the Maladugao river 1.5 km. East Sumogot on the Lanao‚ÄìBukidnon boundary as point 3; then by straight line following the Lumba - a Bayabao‚ÄìWao boundary line. Southward of the intersection of the Lana‚ÄìCotabato boundary as point 4; then finally 1.72 km. Eastward following the Lanao‚ÄìCotabato boundary to the starting point. =Barangays= Amai Manabilang is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. * Bagumbayan * Bandara-Ingud * Comara (Potre Maamor) * Francfort * Lambanogan * Lico * Mansilano * Natangcopan * Pagalamatan * Pagonayan * Penud * Piagma * Poblacion (Apartfort) * Ranao-Baning * Salam * Sigu-an * Sumugot =Climate= The town‚Äôs climate is similar to that of Baguio City. History Bumbaran was commonly known before as ‚ÄúAparport‚Äù its seat of government. Its existence came into being when President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed into law on November 17, 1977, Presidential Decree No. 1243 creating Aparport a separate and independent municipality and naming it the Municipality of Bumbaran, separate from the Municipality of Wao, its mother municipality. This was necessary in order to maximize the enforcement of law and order and expedite optimum and sustainable development. At that time, the municipality consisted of 21 barangays namely: Sumogot, Francfort, Lambanogan, Punud, Comara, Aparport, Paglamatan, Natangcopan, Mansilano, Salam, Bandara-Ingud, Ranao-Ibaning, Bagumbayan, Pagonayan, Piagma, Lico, Siuan, Lama, Borntacan, Miorod, and Someorang. It was reduced to seventeen barangays when President Corazon C. Aquino signed an Executive Order in December 1986 abolishing thousands of barangays in the country which affected barangays Lama, Miorod, Borontacan, and Someorang. =History of Barangay Francfort= The Municipality of Amai Manabilang is composed of two major groups ‚Äì 99% Muslim Bangsamoro and 1% Catholic. Catholics inhabited barangays Sumogot and Francfort. The Muslim Bangsamoros occupied the rest of the 17 barangays. Due to the aftereffect of the Settler Program, in spite of Meranau protestations dividing their once united province, on the excuse of geographical and cultural reasons, the Sangguniang Bayan, thru Resolution designated Barangay Francfort as Poblacion (Center) for Catholic populace and Barangay Natangcopan as poblacion for the Muslim Bangsamoros. Barangay Natangcopan is an extension of Barangay Aparport, the original seat of government. Barangay Francfort, together with barangays Sumogot, Aparport and Mansilano were regular barangays of Wao before Bumbaran was created a municipality. Francfort is named after Mr. Franco and Mr. Fortich, the organizers of the National Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Administrator (NARRA) Settlements Project in the Municipality of Wao. It was created as a regular barangay of Wao in 1965. The first settlers of these barangays were the Ilocanos and Ivatans, followed from 1967 by the Ilongos, Visaya, Kapampangan and other smaller Catholic converted ethnic groups. As anticipated through the Settlements pushing the indigenous away from their land and opportunities, peace and order in the area was interrupted by the Catholic militia ILAGA and the response of the Moro Blackshirts from 1972 to 1976 which caused the evacuation of some residents and damage to properties including the burning of houses. By November 17, 1977, the Municipality of Bumbaran was created into a separate municipality by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1234 signed by then President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos, and barangay Francfort was included as one of its regular barangays. Consequently, in the mid1980s, the people returned little by little. Before Bumbaran was created as a separate municipality, Hadji Acob was the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Francfort; on his death, Efren Vaso succeeded him. In the following barangay election, Columbus Kalaw was elected Barangay Chairman until he was defeated by Wilfredo Barcelona. In 1993, Oscar Baldonasa was elected Chairman and he was re-elected in the 1996 and 2002 barangay elections. Barangay Francfort is bounded on the East by Maridugao/Maridgaw River; West by Barangay Sumogot; On the south Sumogot river; and on the North by Barangay Lambanogan. Mountain ranges, hills, plateaus, and flatland characterize the topography of the barangay. It has a vast agricultural land suited for crops like rice, corn, carrots, sugar cane. Its hydrological features comprise rivers like the Maridugao and Sumogot, streams, swamps, creeks and springs. Barangay Francfort has a total land area of 1,304 hectares. The soil is loam and the climate is temperate. The population is 1,491 according to the 2000 Census, with 298 households. Demographics =Ethic groups= The Municipality of Amai Manabilang is inhabited by settlers of different origins, like Ilonggos, Ivatans, Ilocano, Bisaya and other smaller ethnic groups that dominated barangays Francfort and Sumugot. This is due to the Settlement Program and Land Tenure Lawshttp://issuu.com/lgspa/docs/land-tenure-stories-in-central- mindanao of the Republic of the Philippines. The Moro Maranaws who came from the different municipalities of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte inhabited the rest of the seventeen barangays of this municipality. Their source of livelihood is farming, mainly crop production. Having rich soil, the municipality is one of the largest corn producers in the province, only second to its mother municipality of Wao for having vast agricultural land capable of producing variable crops which could give sufficient food and income to the population.

According to the , it has a population of people. This ancient and royal town of the Maranaos became a municipality under Executive Order No. 21 issued on June 25, 1963 during the term of President Diosdado Macapagal. Barangays Butig is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. Butig had forty four (44) barangays during the time of Mayor Sultan Macabayao M. Macadato until 1979, but reduced to only sixteen (16) barangays when Sangcad S. Bao took over as OIC-Mayor during the time of President Corazon C. Aquino. Climate History Butig is considered as one of the oldest settlements in the center of Mindanao. A sultanate located in the Pangampong (Principality) of Unayan, Lanao, Mindanao, Butig belongs to the confederation of the Sultans of Lanao (Ranao in Maranao language). This historic town is the \\"cradle\\" of Maranao civilization. =Role in Islamization of Mindanao= While Islamic political institutions were being implemented in Sulu, Muslim traders and possibly itinerant teachers visited the eastern and northern parts of Mindanao Island. The advent of Muhammad Kabungsuwan and his lieutenants developed a system of multiple marriage alliances with various ruling families which served as a means of extending both political control and Islamization. The coming of this intrepid Arab-Malay, to whom the pervasive spread of Islam in Mindanao is attributed, and from whom all the leading sultans of that island have claimed descent, can be calculated to have taken place around the second decade of the sixteenth century. (Majul, 1973) From the above-mentioned marriage alliances came the Moro dynasties of Maguindanao, Buayan, and Butig. From the Maranaos of Butig, Islam was then introduced to the Maranaos of Lake Lanao. Whereas the base and strength of the Buayan sultanate was in the upper valley of the Pulangi in the interior of eastern Mindanao, that of the sultanate of Maguindanao was at the lower valley and the nearby coastal areas. Actually, for many years it was Iranun support that strengthened the Maguindanaon rulers against their antagonists. (Majul, 1973) In the time, the continued existence of Islam in Sulu and Mindanao was guaranteed by a more intensive Islamization of their neighbors such as Brunei and Ternate. The royal families of Brunei and Sulu became intimately related, as did those of Maguindanao and Ternate. Commercial relations and religious dialogue expanded among the peoples of these regions ... thus generating a sense of community transcending regional frontiers or dynastic loyalties. (Majul, 1973) =Resistance to European colonialism= In 1658, a strong force took the field against the Moros of Mindanao under the command of Don Francisco Estovar, Governor of Zamboanga. The expedition disembarked before the Moro town of Mamucan in the Cotabato Valley. Here an action conducted by Don Pedro de Biruga, who, with a force of 180 Spaniards, destroyed the town of Butig, with many vessels and a quantity of rice.(Hurley, 1936) Between 1663, when Zamboanga was abandoned, and 1718 when it was refortified, there was an interlude in the Moro Wars, which allowed the sultanates to become better organized and their Islamic institutions to be reinforced. Vigorous commercial relations with other principalities were initiated. It was around this time, too that the Sulu Sultanate acquired the North Borneo territory from the Sultan of Brunei as a grateful recompense for armed intervention in a dynastic quarrel. Sulu had reached the highest level of its territorial expansion. Actually, Sulu was simply filling up the power vacuum left in the island of Borneo as a result of Brunei's gradual political and commercial decline. The Spanish government, principally on account of Jesuit agitation, decided to refortify Zamboanga. The Jesuits, more than any religious order in the Philippines, were the most insistent on the evangelization of Muslims. This attitude cost them (the Jesuits) a few casualties on account of extreme zeal. It is proposed that the fifth stage in the history of the Moro Wars began with the refortification of Zamboanga in 1718 and ended in the Spanish failure in the eighteenth century to reduce the Muslim states to vassalage. To achieve this political end, and Spanish plan was devised to convert the sultans of Sulu and Maguindanao preparatory to the eventual conversion of the datus and other subjects. In this stage, the combined Sulu-Maranao attack to capture Zamboanga in 1719 failed. Again, a desultory war followed. The plan to convert the sultans failed in the case of Maguindanao. Although 'Azim-ud-Din, the sultan deposed by his brother, was baptized in Manila in 1751, that action did not have the desired political results in Sulu since the sultanate was in the hands of a usurper. Also, the question of the sincerity of the conversion still remains an open one. In this fifth stage, the men of Sultan Mardan and the Maranaos of Butig began their devastating attacks on other parts of the Philippines, reducing the number of tributes for Spain coming from the Visayas and causing a virtual disruption in the economic life of many islands under the Spanish colonial regime. On account of thousands of captives taken by the Muslims, some depopulation started to take place in the Visayas. But all this was in response to the Spanish order in 1751 to enslave captured Muslims and destroy their settlements, boats, plantations, and fields. Yet, as the facts demonstrate, it was the Sulu Sultan who was always the first to initiate moves for a peaceful settlement. The lessening of Spanish power as a direct result of the British invasion of the Philippines and capture of Manila in 1762 once again brought about a decline of hostilities between Spaniards and Sulu and Maguindanao. The Muslim principalities again tried to recapture their days of commercial prosperity, but they were not to be left in peace. (Majul, 1973) On December 8, 1720, Dalasi, the Datu of Butig (also known as Rajah Janatun of Butig), with an armada of one hundred vessels or ‚Äúparaws‚Äù manned by Sultan sa Kanluran, Miyangaludan and several thousand Moros, attacked Fort Pilar in Zamboanga. He captured a local Jesuit priest and forced the Spanish government in Manila to give ransom payment in exchange for his freedom. (Hurley, 1936) But the accuracy of this report by Hurley is in doubt considering the distance of Butig (Lanao del Sur) to the shores of Zamboanga. Furthermore, the Jesuits in Zamboanga were more engaged with the Tausugs of Sulu; and for Datu Dalasi, a Maranao of Lanao, to get involved in the affairs of the Sulu Sultanate is highly unusual. =American rule in Mindanao= In July, 1908, Lieutenant Burr of the American colonial forces was leading forty men through the Agus River in Mindanao. Near Nyaan the party came to a cotta, well fortified and surrounded with a moat filled with brush. Resistance being encountered, the soldiers cut through the brush with their bayonets and assaulted the fort. The first soldier to reach the cotta walls was attacked from the rear by a Moro with a kris. Hearing the cry of the soldier, Lieutenant Burr hurried to his assistance, killing the Moro with a pistol. Another Moro sprang from the shelter of the bush and struck Burr before he could turn to defend himself, dealing the American officer a terrible blow on the head with a campilane. Burr died a few days later in the hospital at Camp Kiethley. During the years 1908 and 1909, and for a number of years afterwards, the Butig Mountain range and the Lake Lanao and Buldun sections of Mindanao were infested with outlaw bands ranging in size from a few men to several hundred. Early in the year 1906, Moro outlaws in the inaccessible mountains of Butig fortified themselves in hill-top strongholds under the leadership of Sultan Mangatung and his brother inlaw, Amai Maricor of Maciu. Under Mangatung, a great force of outlaws became established at rancherias and were responsible for terrible depredations throughout the district. Government launches operating at the mouth of the Malaig river were frequently fired upon, with the result that a camp of men from the 15th Infantry was established at the river. The Moros were invited in for parleys and many of them came in and abandoned the outlaw life to return peacefully to their homes. A number of the Moros, however, chose to ignore the American request for conciliation, and after a perty commanded by Lieutenant Furlong was fired upon, an American offensive was undertaken. Sultan Mangatung was killed. Colonel J. F. Hutton took the field at the head of three columns of troops in the Butig Mountains. The soldiers were fired upon from the cottas but after eight serious engagements all of the outlaws in the district were annihilated. Upon completion of these operations in Mindanao, a short period of peace ensued, to be broken by rumblings in Jolo. =Political history= Atty. Dimnatang Labay Pansar is the incumbent mayor of Butig. His predecessors were mayors Ibrahim Mitoon Macadato, Dimnatang Labay Pansar, Pauli Bao-Macabuntal Ditual, Sunnyboy Mona, Monabantog Kiram, Arapa Datukanug, Palawan Amatonding, Abdulrahman Mamalinding Romato, Datu Mombao Mamalinding Romato, Sangcad Mamalinding Bao, Sultan Macalinog Mamalinding Bao and Sultan Macabayao Macadato. Butig is one of the oldest town in the province and the inhabitants thereat are connected to all the Seventeen Royal Houses of Lanao. By tradition, any individual who has no blood line in Butig cannot hold any recognized Royal Title in the Sultanate of Lanao. = Military conflict = Clashes between the Philippine military and a local terrorist organization known as the Maute group which is believed to have ties with Jemaah Islamiyah started on February 20, 2016, after the Maute Group raided the detachment of the 51st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army in the town. Islamic State of Iraq and Syria paraphernalia were discovered at the group's lair after government forces overran the group's camp on February 26, 2016. The firefight displaced 2,000 residents of Butig, and killed 42 members of the group and three government troops. In November 2016, the Maute group seized the town but were driven from their positions by Philippine Army troops after about a week of fighting.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town is one of the two former capitals of the Sultanate of Maguindanao from 1515 until the Spanish conquered the land in 1888, and later became the capital of one of the states of the Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao in 1640. Etymology Malabang comes from the Maranao word \\"mala\\", which means big, and \\"bang\\" or \\"adhan\\" in Arabic, which is a call to prayer. An Arab missionary named Sharif Kabunsuan arrived at the Sultanate of Tubok around the 14th century CE to Islamize the people in mainland Mindanao. Upon docking in the shore of Tubok, which is known today as barangay Tambara, the Arab missionary cried out the call to prayer with his loud voice: the first adhan, or \\"bang\\", in Lanao. The villagers heard this and called it a \\"big adhan\\", or in the local language, \\"mala a bang\\", referring to the coming of Islam to the island. Islam spread through mainland Mindanao soon thereafter. Being marked as the historical foundation of the religion of Islam by inhabitants of central and northern Mindanao, the town was given the name Malabang. Geography Malabang is one of thirty-nine municipalities comprising the province of Lanao del Sur in northern Mindanao. It lies on the south-west part of the province and belongs to the second district. It has 37 barangays with a total land area of 37,789.28 km2. The distance from Marawi City to Malabang is 71 kilometers. Malabang is bounded on the north by the municipality of Calanogas; on the north-west by the municipality of Picong (Sultan Gumander); on the east by the municipality of Marogong; and on the south by the municipality of Balabagan. To the west of Malabang is Illana Bay. It is under the administrative supervision of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) since November 1989, pursuant to R.A. No. 6734 dated June 8, 1989, known as the \\"Organic Act of ARM M\\". The municipality is a level plain in its central to southern portion. A slope in the north is bounded by the Municipality of Calanogas. There is also a slope in eastern Malabang. =Barangays= Malabang is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. =Climate= History Malabang, in Lanao del Sur, is considered the oldest settlement in mainland Mindanao. The Sultanate of T'bok was an established kingdom in present-day Malabang long before the Philippines became a country. The people of Malabang are mostly Maranaos, a tribe indigenous to southern Mindanao; Philippine history books often identify these people as the Iranun tribe. (Iranun is another indigenous tribe of southern Mindanao.) The misconception arose because Iranuns live in some of the barangays in the southern part of Malabang, comprising what is now Balabagan. In March 1969, Executive Order 386, signed by President Carlos P. Garcia, reconstituted the southern part of Malabang as the Municipality of Balabagan. Thus, Iranuns are now residents of Balabagan rather than Malabang. Malabang played a significant part in the early battles against invaders of the Philippines. During the Spanish conquest, Malabang became the headquarters of Muhammad Kudarat, a great warrior and Sultan of Maguindanao. He used to spend time recuperating in Malabang throughout the period when he was fighting to defend Maguindanao against invasion. He later retired to Malabang when he fell ill. He eventually died and was buried there. In May 1977, Presidential Decree 1135 of President Ferdinand Marcos created the Municipality of Picong (formerly Sultan Gumander) out of the north-western portion of Malabang, where Sultan Kudarat's grave was located. During the Second World War, when the Japanese invaded the Philippines, the Japanese military built a large camp in Malabang, including a network of tunnels around it. It was considered a major camp of the Japanese forces. In 1942, the Philippine Supreme Court Chief Justice Jos√© Abad Santos was brought to this camp, after he was captured in Cebu while fleeing from Japanese forces. Chief Justice Abad Santos was executed in the camp for refusing to cooperate with the Japanese, and was buried in barangay Curahab. The place where the camp is situated and where Mr. Santos was executed was later on named Camp Jose Abad Santos (Camp JAS). In 1945, United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces, working with Maranao guerillas, occupied Malabang after a siege. During the Siege of Malabang, the guerillas used weapons like the Maranao kris, barong and kampilan to fight the Japanese forces. The victorious American and Philippine Commonwealth troops, together with their Maranao guerrilla allies, eventually defeated the Japanese Imperial forces. When the built of the general headquarters and military camp base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was station's active in Malabang from 1945 to 1946 during and ended of World War II. Malabang as a municipality was founded on March 1, 1893. The locals of the town celebrate the founding day, the Araw ng Malabang every March 1 annually. Demographics =Languages= The languages spoken in Malabang vary by location and by barangay. Maranao is however the prominent language in Malabang, as the native speakers are the original inhabitants of Malabang. Cebuano is spoken in some barangays with significant Cebuano Visayan immigrant populations who are mostly Catholic Christians. Along with English, Cebuano is used in Catholic masses and religious services as Malabang is part of the Prelature of Marawi, subject to the Archdiocese of Ozamiz. Some descendants of Chinese settlers in China Town (Poblacion) speak Mandarin and to some degree, Hokkien. English is also a commonly spoken language due to American settlers in Matalin and European missionaries, and is also the medium of instruction and working language of the municipal government. Arabic is used in madrassas and spoken by qualified local and visiting ustadz (Islamic scholar) and imams. Settlers from the Maguindanao, Samal and Taus≈´g ethnic groups in barangay Bunkhouse still use their tribal tongues. Although there are no settlers from the Tagalog region in Lanao del Sur, Tagalog is still used in schools, being the national language of the Philippines through its national register Filipino. It is also the alternative language of the Maranao townsfolk when conversing with Visayans, since not all of them know how to speak Cebuano. Economy Agriculture and fishery are the major resources of Malabang. They are also widely known for coconut production. Warehouses of coconut can be found along the major highways of Malabang. Mills in barangay Matalin produce cassava flour. Other agricultural products produced in Malabang include corn, vegetables and rice. Malabang also plays a major role in fishery production. They are known for puzan (a preserved fish product) and bakas (smoked dried fish). Malabang is central to commerce and trade activity in the coastal area of Lanao del Sur. Local government The municipality has a mayor, the head of the municipality of Malabang, a municipal vice mayor, and eight municipal councilors. The municipality also has one Sangguniang Kabataan (youth council) representative and one ABC representative from the Punong Barangay (barangay captains). Infrastructure =Transportation= ;Land Transport: Malabang is quite sufficient when it comes to land transportation to the nearby municipalities.

It is Slovakia's largest church and one of the easternmost Gothic cathedrals in Europe. The record of the existence of Kassa (modern day Ko≈°ice), dating from 1230, is connected with the existence of the rectory church. In the process of the settlement's transformation from a rural community into a town, all its periods of successes and failures have been reflected in St Elisabeth's Cathedral. According to historical and archaeological sources, the present-day cathedral was built on the place of an earlier church also consecrated to St Elisabeth of Hungary. It was referred to in documents of 1283 and 1290, in which the bishop of Eger Andrew II exempted Ko≈°ice parish from the dean's sphere of jurisdiction.Slovak Republic.org; retrieved 19 June 2013Historia, Dom Rimkat; retrieved 19 June 2013. Description St Elisabeth Cathedral is the largest Church in Slovakia with a total area of and capacity of more than 5000 people. It is the main church in the Ko≈°ice Archdiocese. It is one of Europe's easternmost Gothic cathedrals. The church is long and wide; the height of the north tower is . The central nave is 24 m long and aisles are 12 m long. Construction of the church influenced builders' activity in surrounding towns such as Pre≈°ov, Bardejov, Sabinov, Ro≈æ≈àava and it also influenced construction of other churches in Poland and Transylvania. The Gothic Cathedral of Ko≈°ice consists of the choir with a five-side chavet, five naves, two towers, a level sacristy at the north side, and two chapels and antechapel at the south side. There is a unique inside layout of the church, where the central nave and four aisles are crossed in the middle by one transept of the same height and width as the central nave which altogether create a Greek cross. This big central space rises in the centre of the church and together with three equal exterior gables with richly decorated portals belong to the acme of medieval stone work of art in the Middle Europe. The complex of the cathedral and adjacent buildings ‚Äì St Michael Chapel and Urban Tower were declared as Cultural Heritage Monuments in 1970. History =Original church= The oldest Ko≈°ice church probably originated in the middle of the 11th century and was sacred to Saint Michael. It was built in Romanesque style at the same place as the current church. The church is referred to in the oldest written records of the town dated 1230. When German colonists settled in Ko≈°ice in the 1240s, and St Elisabeth became the town's patron saint, the church was rededicated to her. After this change the church started to be adjusted in the Gothic Style in the middle of the 13th century. The church retained the Romanesque tower, but it also got a Gothic vault and a side chapel.Jump up ‚Üë In: D√≥m sv. Al≈æbety ‚Äì Ko≈°ice [online]. Slovakia.travel, 2005, rev. 2010, [cit. 2011-07-19].

Building of a church was also supported by papal curia. In 1402, Pope Boniface IX issued the indulgence bull. All pilgrims who contributed to Ko≈°ice's church had their sins forgiven. The exact date of a new church construction is unknown, but it is supposed to be between 1380 (fire of old church) and 1402 when there was a first written record. The first stage of construction works lasted probably until 1420. During this period the church was built as a five-nave basilica. The construction was done in a way that new cathedral was built around the original foundation. The south polygonal chevet of aisles were built as the first ones. This was followed by the south enclosure wall construction, the south portal and the west wall where first two levels of both towers were composed to floor plan of church.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë DUCHO≈á, Jozef.

An advanced construction margin related to Silesian Gothic, which took part in the Franciscan church construction in the north part of town, was working at building of a new church.

Because of a lack of written reference the architect of construction masonry is anonymous. Ambition of uprightness, light materials and spaciousness of church resulted in construction of the three-aisle cathedral, whereby the essential change of plan was added by the counter aisles to the main nave. This was situated unconventionally to the middle of the main nave length by which a unique central hall space was created. The statue portal decoration of a main nave and side aisles were inspired by Gothic buildings in Prague and Krak√≥w, and was included in the second construction stage. The influence of Parle≈ô masonry at Prague's Saint Vitus Cathedral in the second half of the 14th century became evident in the King's Oratory and its spiral staircase as well as a motif of round banisters of oratory and a stone gallery over the sacristy. Then building of the cathedral continued with the north external wall construction, the polygonal chevet of the north aisle (parallels of south apsids) and eight-sided top levels of the Sigimund's tower. At the end of the second construction stage the cathedral was ready for vaulting and it was necessary to pull down the old church. St Michael's church (today called St Michael's Chapel) was built at the same time as the new church, but it was finished in 1400, and it took over the function of a parish church.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë LUKAƒåIN, Alfonz.

The particular symmetric shapes of the vault bays were different from each other and they were not folded from one bay to the other. The newest part of the construction ‚Äì sacristy and chapel belong to this third construction stage. The Sigimund's tower was finished and a new town erb granted by Ladislaus the Posthumous was sculpted at the fifth floor of tower in 1453. The date 1462, sculpted over the entrance portal to the tower, is the year when work on the tower was finished. =The fourth construction stage ‚Äì 1462‚Äì1490= After finishing the Sigimund's tower, attention turned to the building of the south tower, which was named after the monarch of that time and contributor to the building of tower Matthias Corvinus. This tower was built in a more decorated and vertical style than the north tower of the cathedral, because the construction masonry had changed. At the same time the south shield and portal were finished and there are many elements that recognize Matthias' generosity. Between 1464‚Äì90, Master Stephan Lapicidus or Master ≈†tefan Staimecz from Ko≈°ice, mentioned in documents, was working on the cathedral construction.Jump up ‚Üë ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru k: a b JUD√ÅK, Viliam.

S. 55 (in Slovak) Master ≈†tefan built side aisles of the cathedral that were not included in an origin floor plan. It was financed by rich city-dweller families. The Saint Cross Chapel was built by senator August Cromer in 1475. The Saint Maria chapel was built by Satmary Rod in 1477 and by the end of the same century The Saint Joseph Chapel (which no longer exists) was built at the north side of the cathedral. An inside feature from this period is a work of Master Stephan ‚Äì the stone pastophorium, and probably the relief of St Elisabeth at the sacristy wall as well. At that time the church was furnished by rich Gothic mobiliari, from which not too much was kept until today. The main altar of Saint Elisabeth between 1474‚Äì77 from the unknown artist has been preserved. =Final construction stage ‚Äì 1491‚Äì1508= After Matthias Corvinus' death began the contest of the throne in Hungary. At that time Polish-Latvian regent John I Albert attacked Ko≈°ice city. It was the first time that Ko≈°ice was shot by cannons. The church was heavily damaged, and Nikolaus Krumpholz from Ni≈° was charged with its reconstruction. Master builder Vaclav from Prague assisted him with the reconstruction. According to the documents from the era at cordon of the west fa√ßade the reconstruction was done between 1496‚Äì98. In 1508, the presbytery was completed; this is considered to be the year when the cathedral construction was finished. This fact is documented by the scroll of parchment with the particular year and the name of master builder Krumpholz which was found in the presbytery pillar after the big reconstruction of the church in 1908.Jump up ‚Üë ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru k: a b ≈†A≈†KY, Ladislav.

Available online; ISSN 1335-4566. =Reformation period= In 1556, Ko≈°ice was affected by a huge fire which damaged the cathedral as well. The church roof, timbers of the roof and a large part of interior were burnt. All the necessary repairs were done by master builder Stanislaus from Krak√≥w, master builders Johann and Gebriel and stone master Matyas. After this the church was administered by Protestants. They owned the church until 1604 when it was violently garrisoned by Catholics, along with Eger's chapter house. This incident became one of the main reason of anti-Habsburg revolt of Stephen Bocskai who devoted the church to Calvinists. The church was returned to Eger's chapter house in 1671 by Emperor Leopold I's decision. During this time the necessary repairs were done and a chapter house treasure was placed in the church. During Count Imre Th√∂k√∂ly de K√©sm√°rk's revolt (1682‚Äì85) the church was claimed by Protestants. In 1685, the church was permanently restored to the Catholic community. =Baroque period= In 1706 the church was damaged during the Francis II R√°k√≥czi occupation. The most damaged parts were the west and the south side of the church. During the 18th century several parts of the church were fixed and embellished. Stained glass window in the transept In the second half of the 18th century the church already had 14 altars (with comparison to the 10 that exist today). Baroque‚ÄìRococo helmet with sightseeing view obtained the Sigimund's tower after the fire in 1775. =Fabry's reconstruction in 1858‚Äì1863= After several years of religious wars and neglected maintenance it was necessary to update the cathedral at the beginning of the 19th century. There were earthquakes in 1834 and in 1845; the town was flooded and the flood extended to the cathedral where several parts of the ground pavement were damaged. During the 19th century there was an initiative for the cathedral reconstruction in Neo-Gothic style, which was organised by Bishop Ign√°c F√°bry, and Imre Henszlmann, an artist and monuments innovator in Hungary. In 1857, the St Elisabeth Cathedral Alliance was established by the members who were devoted to cathedral repairs which took place from 1856‚Äì63 under the control of the Emperor's Royal Central Commission of Preservation and Repair of Architectural Monuments and as well as under the assistance of Henszlmann. Works were laid out by master builders K√°roly Gerster and Lajos Frey. F√°bry's reconstruction effected change of several portals' statues, clapboards to ceramic roof-tiles, stock of new window panes, repair of the south hall and Romantique interior painting. On the other hand, very important structural defects of the church which were evident at that time were not removed and repaired. Some of the columns were off center from their central line. Their bases were standing on a colour blade layer which was soaked by ground water. Arch ruptures were covered by mortar or were covered by wood. Such an unprofessional practise led to the destruction and state of disrepair after a big windstorm in 1875. =Major reconstruction in 1877‚Äì1896= In 1872, the Hungarian Temporary Monuments Commission was established, with Imre Henszlmann was the commission secretary. A major reconstruction was realized from 1877‚Äì96 and was the main priority of the Monuments Commission. It was financed mostly from the state budget of the Hungarian government. Imre Steindl, a professor of Medieval Architecture of Budapest Technical University and the most famous architect of the Hungarian neo-Gothic, was named as the main architect of the reconstruction works. Based on the ruptures in arches he decided that pillars' allocation in the aisles was the main reason for the state of a disrepair of the cathedral statics. He worked out a completely new purist projection of the cathedral's reconstruction where the three-aisle cathedral was rebuilt to a five-aisle cathedral and added arches in side aisles. Originally medieval star arches at the main as well as the side aisles were rebuilt to network ones. An old choir was removed and on its place Steindl built expanded replicas with more pillars. The next works involved the exterior ‚Äì adjusting the external walls and gavels, supporting the columns, the water-chutes and windows' carved works, the portals' decoration and the change of Matthias' tower roof. The late-Gothic St Joseph's Chapel at the north part of the cathedral was completely removed. A neo-Gothic tower which was crossing the main and the side aisles, fl√®che was created. Steindl's primary plan was to rebuild all the neo-Gothic additional building and components in the cathedral. But those suggestions were declined by the commission and they requested a cheaper exchange of old stone parts for the new ones. Re-Gothicisation of the towers was not realized due to a lack of funds, reflected in a cheaper construction material. During the Exchange of a base system from 1878‚Äì82 cheap but low- quality sandstone from the nearby Spi≈°≈°k√© Vlachy stone-pit was used.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë Katedr√°la ‚Äì D√≥m sv.

Available online (in Slovak) Its quick dilapidated outer surface resulted in removal of pinnacles and gargoyles because they endangered pedestrians. With the next reconstruction after 1882 good quality sandstone from Bansk√° Bystrica was used. The main Master builder of the major reconstruction from 1877‚Äì80 was Josepf Weber. From 1880‚Äì96, Friedrich Wilhelm Fr√∂de from Vienna was the main master builder. Supervision was done by Austrian architect Friedrich von Schmidt. After that a famous architect, Schmidt's student, Imre Steindl had started to work on Budapest parliament (in 1885), and Otto Sztehl√≥ became his successor. This architect used a preservative method at the Matthias tower in contrast with the previous purist method of his forerunners. The Sigimund's tower, the Matthias tower (except the roof), the inner side of exterior walls, the Medieval portals with reliefs, the stone inventory of interior and the whole chapel (just the interior part) were kept from neo-Gothic reconstruction. In 1896 a newly delivered neo-Gothic interior equipment (altars, statues, pictures) was bought and donated for Ko≈°ice's Cathedral by Hungarian clergy, Bishop of Kassa and maecenas Zsigmond Bubics. In 1906, a cathedral crypt was built under the north side aisle according to project of Hungarian architect Frigyes Schulek. This crypt was prepared for enclosing relics of Francis II R√°k√≥czi and his companions from the Ottoman Empire. =Major reconstruction 1978 until today= In 1970, St Elisabeth Cathedral was declared a National Cultural Monument. All the profiled architectural features (pinnacles, gargoyles, gadroons) had been either destroyed by the rain water or were unmounted. The stone decoration at the north portal was very much affected by weathering. Cathedral reconstruction started again in September 1978 with detailed architectural documentation. After a short break, works started again in 1984. In the meantime authorities started with the complex solution of Ko≈°ice centrum monuments innovation, which was in 1983 declared as the biggest town monuments reservation in Slovakia. One of the factors that contributed to higher care of church was excluding motor-vehicle traffic from the main street in 1984 and tram traffic in 1986.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë D√≥m sv.

From 1980‚Äì92 the most damaged part of the chapel and sacristy were reconstructed. The works were done by the Polish company Polskie Pracownie Konserwacji Zabytk√≥w from Vratislav. It was necessary to construct the new crown gardoons, gargoyles and pinnacles ‚Äì according to the accessible documents and projects from the town's archival collection. Similarly the staircase towers were done. The gargoyles' reconstruction was done according to original Medieval patterns which are retained in the museums. This reconstruction included the interior repair of a chapel. In 1992‚Äì95 the south fa√ßade (cleaning and preservation), including windowpanes was done. The Sigimund's tower was under consistent renovation in 1995‚Äì97 when a rococo copper helmit was replaced. Cleaned and gilded plumbing decorations are originals from 1775.

The Matthias tower is awaiting reconstruction. Architecture The base of the space composition is formed by the central nave with five bays which is divided by the cross aisle with one bay in axis. Apparent substitution of an idea are four subordinate spaces, inset into the ground plan of the building and inserted between the arms of main and cross aisle. In the first decades probably the enclosure walls were built and the main outline of space disposition was finished. In the next few years the question of portals and arches construction should have been solved. In the original spirit of the architecture the excellent stone sculpture works from 1420‚Äì40 enriched construction structure with three big portals. The north, the south, and west portals in Ko≈°ice have difficult profiles, eventuated in dynamic curves, alternating by horizontal and vertical cornices of relief boards and were decoratively enriched by pinnacles. Those architectural works through profile ceiling and allow new ideas using decorative views and play of light and shadow. =Vaulting= As is seen from the reconstruction of V. Mencl, the conception of the figural vaulting is based on individual parts of split arcades' curves and inter vault parts. Their shapes' difficult play is formed by the scheme of the sun rising with its spikes out of the splitting columns. For each sun an individual pattern of its middle is very important. From its diagonal vectors it creates shapes of the cross, rhombus and the trapezoid. In the subordinate spaces, which are clutched by the arms of main Greek cross of the main aisle and the side aisle, at connecting walls and the east side, the sun scheme is lost in a tangle of cranked rib networks. Master ≈†tefan built a sacrarium over the anteroom at the south wall and he is adding adoration to the chapel of St Cross to its east side and chapel of Mettercia to the west side. At the north side there is the chapel of St Joseph. In these parts the ribs do not reach the head of the lisena but they gather to the arch construction. The vaulting of the chapels is based on an irregular star net vault. =Windows= Master J√°n of Pre≈°ov demolished old walls and suggested an atrial type which can be seen mostly at the triple aisle. As from the artistic point of view he used efficiency of the smooth walls and the large windows in order to whiten the interior. =Heraldry at windows of main aisle= From the main altar towards the west gate is decorated by windows of the main altar with heraldries of Ko≈°ice, Abov's chair and Hunyady chair as well as the heraldry of the countries of the 15th century King Matthias Corvinus: Dalmatia, The Big Bulgaria, Transylvania, Hungary, Serbia, Slavonia, Croatia, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.

When opened, they represent scenes of the Angelic salutation, the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi and the Flight to Egypt. When closed, they depict the sacred personages Saint Catherine, John the Baptist, Saint Barbara and John the Apostle. The predella is painted with votives of Vir dolorum, Virgin Mary, John the Evangelist, Saint Michael the Archangel and Margaret the Virgin. The latter were patrons of the Gunthert family. Like the main altar of Saint Elisabeth, the upper part of this altarpiece is late Gothic and decorated with the three groups of sculptures: the legend of three marriages of Saint Anne, statues of the Apostles and of Mary on the top. Altar of Anthony of Padua The character of this altarpiece lies in the fact that it is composed of the two late-Gothic altarpieces from the first half of the 16th century, which were saved after a great fire of the city of Ko≈°ice in 1556. The paintings on wings are the oldest dated of the all altarpiece paintings in the cathedral. They depict 16 saints on the both sides. In 1860, the altar image of Anthony of Padua painted by Ferenc Klimkovics was placed in the original arch. Altar of Mettercia The Neo-gothic altarpiece from the end of the 19th century was manufactured to order of Bishop Zsigmond Bubics, for the purpose of emplacement of new-found late gothic painting of Mettercia. The rare painting of Tyrolean origin from 1516 depicts Saint Anne and the ancestry of Isaiah. The painting was made for a commission from the family of pharmacist Bartolomej Czottman, and his wife and he are depicted with their coats of arms, among which the coat of arms of Ko≈°ice is placed in accordance to the latest grant of arms. A mortar, as a symbol of pharmacists is featured beyond the municipal coat of arms. Altar of Saint Anne It is one of the series of neo-Gothic altarpieces from 1896 bought for the cathedral on the occasion of the millennial celebration of the Hungarian's arrival to the homeland, as well as of the termination of restoration works. The altarpiece was a gift from incumbent Bishop Zsigmond Bubics. Altar of Wise Men Bought in Paris, it was a gift from Bishop Zsigmond Bubics in 1896. Altar of Saint Joseph A gift from Konstantin Schuster, the bishop of V√°c, in 1896. It was crafted of pieces bought in Brussels by Lajos Lantay, a sculptor from P√∂sty√©n. Altar of Saint Stephen A gift from Franti≈°ek Pogaƒç, the canon of Ko≈°ice, in 1896. Crafted by Ferdinand Stufflesser, the Tyrolean carver. Altar of the Three Martyrs of Ko≈°ice The Three Martyrs of Ko≈°ice were beatified in 1905, Lajos Tihanyi. Crafted the altarpiece dedicated to them in 1923 in Bansk√° Bystrica. Their remains are stored in the predella. Altar of the Holy Cross It is historically the newest altarpiece in the cathedral, crafted in Ko≈°ice in 1931 by Vojtech Buchner in commemoration of victims of the World War I. Two iron panels feature names of all the people who contributed to the construction of the altarpiece. =Not installed altars= Altar of the Last Supper A triptych altarpiece from the last third of the 15th century is segmented in the deposit of the East Slovak Museum. Altar of John the Baptist A neo-Gothic altarpiece crafted for a rare oil tempera painted panel from 1516. It was installed in the cathedral until 1944. After reconstruction work from 1965‚Äì70 the panel was obtained by the East Slovak Museum. One side of the panel depicts scene of the Baptism of Christ in Jordan and the other depicts the torture of Saint John. They are of high quality with a notable impact of the Dutch and Flemish renaissance. Altar of the Death of Mary An original Gothic altarpiece which was not installed in 1943. Only the predella was preserved, which is lost in the archival store of the cathedral. =The bronze baptistery= The Roman-Gothic baptistery from the 14th century is the oldest monument preserved in the cathedral. It comes from the old church of Saint Elisabeth, the ancestor of today's cathedral. The leg of the baptistery is decorated with triangles, and the chalice is ornamented with zoomorphic reliefs of lions, gryphons and eagles. The upper brim is lined with an illegible Latin inscription. The lid dates back to 1914. =Wall frescoes= In 1892, during the large-scale reconstruction works, a number of original Gothic frescoes was discovered hidden under a layer of plaster since the period of Reformation. Three of them are in the south apse: The Savior on the Day of Judgement in an aureola (sitting Christ holding a sword, Mary and Saint Peter below him), Twelve Apostles and the Resurrection of Christ (with his right hand holding a battalion and blessing with his left hand). In the northern side apse next to the entry of sacristy another set of genuine Gothic frescoes could be found: the Descent from the Cross, dating back to the 16th century, conceived as winged wall altarpiece. Paintings on the right side are the Flagellation and the Coronation with Crown of thorns, and on the left side Christ nailed at the cross and Christ before Pilate. =Calvary= The sculpture of Calvary dating back to 1420 is one of the oldest articles of cathedral's inventory. Its components are: 4.34m tall cross with 3.12m tall nailed Christ in the centre, 2.73m tall statue of Mary on the right side and 2.5-metre-tall statue of John the Evangelist on the left. Originally, the group of statues was installed in triumphal arch of the nave until 1936, when it was reinstalled in the Royal Oratory. This monumental carved wood piece of art is notable for its deep theatricality of emotional expression of the Christian Period culture. =Four wooden gothic polychromed sculptures= The four wood carvings crafted around 1470, whose authorship is attributed to Jan Weysz, the woodcarver from Presov, correspond to the period style of the main altarpiece of Saint Elisabeth. The sculptures are 108‚Äì112 cm tall and their current installation is secondary, i.e. in the choir's pillars of the western portal. Originally they probably formed a component of an unpreserved upper part of St Elisabeth's altarpiece. The sculptures represent Saint Stephen, his son Saint Emeric of Hungary, Saint Ladislaus and Stanislaus of Szczepan√≥w, the Polish bishop. =Mater Dolorosa on column= A polychromed wood carving from the period of 1500 112 cm tall. It is installed on a late Gothic twisted column. Above the statue, a Gothic ciborium was inserted into the southern side wall. The expressiveness and the pleating of the gown attest to the high level of late Gothic wood-carving in Ko≈°ice. =Lantern of Matthias Corvinus= The pinnacle with a niche for lantern built on a stone twisted column dates back to the end of the 15th century. The pinnacles' tympanums are ornamented with the coat of arms of Ko≈°ice, Kingdom of Hungary, of Czech and Dalmatia. One unidentified coat of arms is present as well as the one of the Hunyadi family. Originally, the lamp illuminated the area in front of the southern portal towards the neighbouring cemetery. It served its purpose until the early 20th century when it was adapted to gas lighting. It was installed in its current place on the tower wall of Matthias in 1940. =Choir= thumbnail The pipe organ choir was completely replaced in the period of large-scale reconstruction works in the end of the 19th century. The current replica is a bit longer and has more pillars than the original one. Four polychromed sculptures described above are installed on the pillars and complemented with another four neogothic sculptures of Kings of Hungary: Charles I of Hungary, Louis I of Hungary, Sigismund of Luxemburg and Matthias Corvinus. A new pipe organ was crafted by Angster from Patkostolie. Access to it is through a stairway in the southern tower. The original one was discovered on Ko≈°ice by a collector, Austrian Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek who bought it and had it transported to his castle Burg Kreuzenstein near Vienna.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë KAUNTZ, Bernhard.

S. 27. =Pastophorium= A stone pastophorium for storing the eucharist, which is located in the northern pillar of triumphal arch, is the most accurate stone masonry work in the cathedral. It was crafted by Master ≈†tefan around 1477. The pastophorium with hexagonal plan is ornated with complex composition of pillars moldings, friezes, arcades and arches. The twisted niche for storing the eucharist is located on the first floor pastophorium. The metal-tipped door decorated with thumbnails of coat of arms of some lands and noblemen dates back to the 15th century. The tiny plaster sculptures of prophets and kneeling angels replaced former missing parts in the end of the 19th century. Since the Council of Trent, the pastophorium had become redundant and thus the staircase leading to the pastophorium lost its purpose and was removed in 1860. =The relief of Saint Elisabeth= It originated in the same period as the stone pastophorium and the authorship is also attributed to Master ≈†tefan. It is made of three parts which do not fit together because of their compositions. The relief by itself is decorated in abrupt manner in a contrast with hexagonal ciborium with bolt ending with filigree scenes from the Old Testament. The tip of the ciborium in the shape of the pinnacle is ended with composition of nestled pelican which is the symbol of Christ's blood. In the 19th century the relief was complemented with a Latin inscription S.Elisabeth ora pro nobis positioned above the console. =Rainer Melichar epitaph= The Baroque epitaph of the family of municipal reeve Rainer Melichar is one of the few Neo-gothic relics preserved in the cathedral and dates back to the beginning of the 17th century. The image of Flagellation is between two family coats of arms; above, there is a sculpture of Christ Crucified and above the tympanum, there is a Baroque group of sculptures of two angels on the sides and Christ holding the Earth in the middle. =Aurole of Madonna= Another Baroque relic in the cathedral which appropriately exponentiates the aesthetic interior d√©cor is hanging aureole from the first half of the 18th century, installed under the triumphal arch. The double-sided sculpture of Madonna with child is in the middle of the aureole. =Pews= Some of the cathedral pews are from the 18th century and crafted in Baroque style, other are from the end of the 19th century. Oppositely positioned canonical pews in presbytery were crafted during the period of the large-scale reconstruction works of the cathedral in accordance with the design of the main architect Imrich Steindl. He designed the patronal pew of communs with an engraved painted coat of arms of Ko≈°ice. =Chapel of Mettercia ‚Äì Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary= One of the two chapels in the cathedral is the Chapel of Annunciation to the blessed Virgin Mary located in the area between Matthias Corvinus' tower and the vestibule of the southern portal. It was built in 1477 by Stefan and allegedly his portrait is on the console of cross-ribbed vaults. The builder holds a paper strip in his hands. The altarpiece of Mettercia is installed in the chapel, hence the other name. The parents of the Hungarian primate Juraj Szatmary had it built, hence the chapel is also called the Chapel of Szatmary. In the beginning of the 19th century, a crypt of bishops of Ko≈°ice was established under its floor. Their gravestones are embedded into the enclosure walls. Ignac Fabry, Zsigmond Bubics, Augustin Fischer-Colbrie and Jozef ƒå√°rsky are buried there. =Chapel of Saint Cross= The second Chapel of the Dome is the Chapel of Saint Cross also built in year 1475. Its donor was the city consul and reeve August√≠n Cromer, the reason that the chapel is also called Cromer's chapel. Nowadays it is used as the sacristy. =King's Oratory= To the period of building the old cathedral belongs the construction of the King's Oratory. It was created on the first floor of the polygonal arch of the south annex of transept aisle. On the wall under the oratory is a very significant epigrafic relic from the acting time of John Jiskra of Brand√Ωs in the function of Ko≈°ice captain.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë Doppelwendeltreppe Graz [online]. wikipedia.de, [cit. 2011-08-25].

(in Slovak) =The singer stage= The stone gallery located on the north wall of the main aisle in place of a presbytery belongs to the original accommodation of the cathedral. Its purpose was likely to present different medieval allegories and mysteries during the worship ceremony by actors and singers. =Statue of Saint Florian= Saint Florian was the patron of firemen and protection from fire. The town built his statue in 1748, which first stood near St Michael's Church (later Chapel), later on near the south wall of St Urban Tower, until the year 1940 when it was moved to where it now stands at the entrance hall of the south portal. =Adyton= Building of the adyton belongs to the third part of construction of the Dome, the years 1440‚Äì62. In addition there are neo-Gothic statues on the consoles from Jana Marschalek from the end of 19th century. They represent saints. Windowpanes were created by Karl Geyling in Vienna in 1860. On the panes are illustrated coats of arms of minor canons. =The sacrificial altar= The newest element of the cathedral's inventory is the sacrificial altar of the celebrating priest. It is located in the front of the main altar, and is carved from a single piece of sandstone in the shape of two arms creating an ellipse. The sacrificial altar stands on the tabernacle of the shape of a heart. Near the altar is a new ambon (place for preaching) and the sedeses (chairs). All the three objects were created by Michael and Thomas Ban√≠k in 1994. =Pulpit= The stone pulpit with wooden shelter is the masterpiece of sculptors W. Aubram and R. Argenti. On the twisted staircase to it are placed statues of the argurs and the church fathers. =Crypt of R√°k√≥czi= Beside the north wall of the Dome a crypt was built in 1906 for remains of Francis II R√°koczi, Hungarian nobleman and Prince of Transylvania and his family and favored friends. The crypt and the four stone sarcophagi were designed by professor Frigyes Schulek from Budapest. In one sarcophagus are buried together the prince, his mother (Ilona Zr√≠nyi), and his older son Joseph. South is the sarcophagus of General Count Antal Esterh√°zy, north is where Mikl√≥s Sibrik is interred. In the fourth sarcophagus on the other side of crypt Count Mikl√≥s Bercs√©nyi and his second wife, Krisztina Cs√°ki are buried. =Apotheosis of life Ferenc II R√°k√≥czi= The monumental mural painting above the north portal of the cathedral is from years 1914‚Äì16 and its author is Andor Dudics (or Dudits). It is a triptych. Exterior =The North portal= The north portal Relief at top of north portal Statues of the north portal Design of the north portal is rare according to medieval tradition in which the north sides of churches did not have portals. Its statues are the most decorative out of the three portals of the cathedral. The reason for this is probably its facing the busiest part of medieval Ko≈°ice-to the city market and the city hall. The portal is known as The Golden Gate, because it was gilded in the Middle Ages. The north portal has two entrance doors. Above those is an arch with a relief of The Last Judgement. The relief is divided into two parts. In the lower one is seen a crowd of people heading to the gates of heaven, where they are welcomed by an angel, and the others who are going to hell are heading to the leviathan's jaws with devils and are in chains. The upper part shows the Last Judgement, the two angels with horns announcing the end of the world. The other figures represent the 12 apostles. Around the relief of the Last Judgement is in three degrees placed five frame reliefs decorated by pinnacles, profilation and traceried motives. Two lower reliefs refer to the life of St Elisabeth. The other three recreate the scene from Calvary. At the top is Christ crucified on the cross in a shape of tree of life. The other two crucified on Golgotha are shown on the left side as the saved soul carried to heaven by an angel, while on the right side the soul is carried to hell by a devil. Under the scene of Crucifixion on the left side are crying women around Virgin Mary under the cross and on the right side is John the Evangelist surrounded by Roman soldiers. During the great reconstruction of the dome they added niches along the both gates of north portal for Neo-gothic statues of the saints. The niches are original and it is not known what statues stood on them during the last centuries. The other Neo-Gothic statues decorate the portal of the east gavel. The statues are Ugarian kings Charles I of Hungary, his wife Elisabeth of Poland and Louis of Hungary. They are masterpieces of the Budapest sculptor Lajos Lantay. =The West Portal= According to liturgical custom the main entrance to the church is the west portal. Although it has three gates, this entrance has the most simple stone decoration. Two sides are without figure decoration. Above the main gate are two reliefs. One of them directly over the gate shows Christ in Getsemane garden piteously praying to His Father. To the left of Christ are apostles Peter, John and Jacob, from the right come soldiers led by Judas. In the seddle finish of the portal is the scene of Pieta, Virgin Mary holding Christ body, surrounded by Maria Magdalene and Mary Joseph. The uppermost relief shows angels holding Veronica's towel with Christ's face print. The whole symbology of portals relates with local tradition of The Holy Blood. At the end of 19th century two Neo-Gothic statues were placed to the main gate of which only one ‚Äì the statue of John the Baptist has been preserved. =The South Portal= The south portal differs from the previous two portals by the fact that it is placed to the ante-room under the king's empora. It has two gates, the same as the north portal, but without the figures in relief. Instead they are finished by saddles with triangle circling pikes above which is another row of saddles. The portal gives the impression of a triple level entrance to the cathedral. An interesting component of the portal is aerial bolt of gothic arch of an Ante‚Äìroom with leaf ornaments. Very interesting is also the baldachin of the statue in the middle of the portal which is formed by flying rooks. The other rook and beast hold devices of the torment. Based on this it is supposed that under the baldachin was previously a statue of Christ. Today there is statue of Imaculata from the end of the 19th century made by statue maker John Marschalko. The other statues at the portal are saints, emperor Constantine the Great, Elizabeth of Hungary, Adalbert of Prague, the Apostle Andrew (patron of Ko≈°ice archdiocese), Xavier and Bishop Teodor. These statues have nothing to do with the symbolism of the portal; they represent patrons and those who financed the major reconstruction of the Cathedral at the end of the 19th century. The middle portrait belongs to architect Imrich Steindl. The others included Fridrich Wilhelm Fr√∂de and Otto Sztehl√≥. =The Sigismund's tower= Sigismund's tower The north tower, which was built in the second period of church construction in 1420‚Äì40, was finished in the third period of construction in 1462. This is proved by Ko≈°ice's arms with the sculpted year 1462 over the portal of the west fa√ßade which is also the entrance to the tower. The tower stays at four ‚Äì square floor plan and has three levels. From the fourth level it narrows to an octagonal floor plan. A simply decorated tower has between floor cordons decorated by cresting with a geometric motif. Between the fourth and the fifth floor the decoration is complemented by rosette ‚Äì roses, while each of them is profiled to the different shape. The Sigimund's tower was heavily damaged between 1490‚Äì91 when Ko≈°ice was besieged by John I Albert's army. It was reconstructed by Mikul√°≈° Crompholz from Ni≈°, under the guidance of Vaclav from Prague in 1494‚Äì97. After the fire in 1775 the tower was built up a little bit and on the top of it a Rococo monkshood was mounted, which created the sixth floor of the tower.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë ƒéUR√çƒåEK, Andrej.

On the first floor there is the mechanism of a large clock, on the second floor there is construction for the bells. On the third floor are two bells from 1926. Alexander Buchner had new bells cast ‚Äì The God's heard which has 1 530 kg and which holds names of those killed during World War I.

After the construction break the work on building the tower followed in 1462 when the north tower was finished. The works were managed by Master ≈†tefan until 1477. He constructed it in a more decorated and massive way in comparison with the north tower, although it was not built up to its planned height. It is finished at a level of crown cordon of the main aisle by decorative wreath with heraldries of countries belonging to King Matthias and heraldry of Ko≈°ice. The tower is now covered by an octagon metal-sheet roof. The curiosity of the tower is a labyrinth of a circular staircase which are linked to each other. Its importance has not been clarified. The entrance is from the west choir of the cathedral and its staircase also allows access to the pipe organ. The rich decoration of the exterior is complemented by the statues of Matthias Corvinus's supporters which are from Budapest sculptor Franti≈°ek Mikula from the 20th century. =The sun dial= On the exterior wall of the south fa√ßade above the biggest window of the Mettercie Chapel is situated the horologe type sun dial type from the year 1477.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë BAUER, Juraj.

Available online (in Slovak) Legends of the cathedral Over the years legends of the cathedral were created and maintained. Most of them have their roots in the Middle Ages of building the dome. Construction continuing over the centuries gave birth to the legend of the hollow stone, which the builders put on an unknown place in the cathedral. If the stone was lost, the whole cathedral would fall. There is also a legend about the gargoyle of the drunk women ‚Äì it is said that she was the master builder's alcoholic wife. The legend says that because she was tarnishing his reputation by her appearance in the town, he made her a gargoyle forever. There is a legend about the lantern of King Matthias. The lantern was said to have a power to take away the guilt from every criminal who stood under it. The last legend is about Christ's blood. During the common Sunday mass the priest spilt the consecrated goblet full of wine on the floor where the image of suffering Christ was created, and some believers heard the Christ moan, they said.Jump up ‚Üë Skoƒçit nahoru ‚Üë Tajomstv√° D√≥mu sv√§tej Al≈æbety: ƒåo o ≈àom neviete?

According to the , it has a population of people. History The municipality was named Piagapo as the word relates closely to several royal houses of the Pat A Pangampong a Ranao. It is believed that during the ancient time, Piagapo was territorial land originally ruled by a queen ruler ‚ÄúDayang Labi\\", a direct descendant of Sharief Kabungsuan, the first Muslim missionary who landed in Maguindanao to spread the religion Islam. Being queen ruler of the land, she was popularly enthroned and widely known as the ‚ÄúBai sa Radapan‚Äù. Furthermore, to retain her name and legacy in the history of Piagapo, one of the Barangays was named after her title as the Bai sa radapan. It was called Radapan. This is the place where most of her descendants reside. Moreover, claimants of the sultanate leadership in the different areas of Piagapo usually trace up their genealogical origin from the progenitor, the Bai sa Radapan. Only her progeny can claim a royal title. The Municipality of Piagapo was once a component of the Municipality of Saguiaran, Lanao del Sur. On March 17, 1957, the president signed Executive Order No. 431 creating Piagapo into a municipal district which took effect effectively. The name Piagapo was proposed by a group of leaders from Sendigan led by Sultan a Diamla and presented by Mangompia S. Gunting. The name Piagapo was unanimously adopted as the name of the municipal district. Piagapo was then converted into a regular municipality on July 1, 1965, by virtue of Executive Order No. 166 signed on August 27, 1965. Piagapo also divided into three districts: Sundigan A Piagapo, Pat a Panoroganan, Bubonga Marantao and composed of 37 barangay. =Martial Law= Piagapo is one of the Municipalities suffered and receiving Evacuees from municipality of Munai and municipality of Tangcal during Martial Law in 1972. Almost Evacuees living in Munai at the time were abandoned their home, livestock, land, etc. and they moved to boundary somewhere in Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte. Most of the people stay meanwhile to Barangay Lininding of Munai, a boundary of Municipality of Piagapo, Lanao del Sur. The only remaining people that time of evacuation process were the Moro (Male and Female including Children) Fighter and one of their Leader Commander was Commander Tagoranao \\"AKA James Bond\\" Macapaar bin Sabbar, a MNLF Top Commander for Lanao del Norte. Late Commander James Bond is the sibling of MILF Top Commander Abdullah Macapaar \\"Commander Bravo\\". Moro Rebels from Munai had a fight side-by-side with the Moro Rebels from neighboring Tangkal against Philippines Constabulary (PC) Army. After peaceful was process in the middle of 1980s, The Team of MILF Commander Sultan Saifudin Romandiar Tomawis and MILF Commander Sultan Tagoranao Goldiano Macapaar bin Sabbar along with the MILF Commander Sansarona from Maguindanao had stay and made a Temporary \\"MILF Camp Bansayan\\" in Bansayan, a barangay of Piagapo until end of EDSA Revolution on 1986. During the stay, there were enormous battle between MILF forces and Government Forces. Both MILF Commanders had went to Afghanistan to join the war against Russian on 1984. The said Camp was abandoned by MILF Soldiers when civilian had given the map and provide with guide the Government Forces when that MILF Camp on early EDSA Revolution. On the Attack of Government Forces, they come secretly at night in barangay bansayan and they stay at the near of the MILF Camp Bansayan for almost 10hrs until 3:00AM and strike the Camp. The One of the Field Commander who stay long and withdraw later to fight is Commander Abiden Dimacuta Umpar because he handle .30 Machine Gun. Geography It is located in the first district of the province of Lanao del Sur, Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and has total land area of 340.09 square kilometers distributed over the 37 barangays that are predominantly populated by Maranao people. =Barangays= Piagapo is divided into 3 districts and composed of 37 barangays. Bubonga Marantao: * Aposong * Bubo * Bualan * Bubonga Ilian * Bubonga Mamaanun * Bubonga Tawaan * Ilian Proper * Ilian Poblacion * Lumbaca Mamaanun * Mamaanun * Mentring * Palao * Paling * Paridi * Pindolonan * Rantian *Sapingit Pat A Panoroganan: * Bangco * Basak * Gacap * Katumbacan * Olango * Pantaon * Pantar * Radapan Poblacion * Radapan Proper * Tambo * Tapocan * Tawaan Sundigan A Piagapo: * Bagoingud * Bansayan * Kalungnan * Lininding * Palacat * Talao * Taporug * Udalo =Climate= Piagapo being part of Lanao del Sur has predominantly cold climate. The climate observed in the community is very unpredictable where rainfalls are mostly observed during the month of July, August, September and October. Dry season is observed during summer the month of March, April and May. The Municipality is hilly and mountainous. The beautiful mountains with vast trees in the area serve as natural barriers against typhoon and strong wind and other natural calamities. =Terrain and Natural Resources= The area is hilly and mountainous with scattered plain areas suitable for agricultural activities. These plain portions are either upland or lowland. It is rich in natural resources such as wide vast of forest area with varieties of good trees, rivers, springs and streams that have good potentials for further development. However, the local government unit should pay attention on the issues regarding illegal logging and kainging otherwise the community would be prone to erosion and landslides that will endanger many lives. The natural resources of the Municipality especially its wide and diverse forest should be protected and preserved. Demographics =Population= The Municipality of Piagapo is a Muslim area that is predominantly populated by Maranao tribe who are culturally bounded people. Its people, majority of which, do not accept birth control, birth spacing and other methods. They believe it is against their religious belief. However, majority of them learned to accept other health intervention particularly to maintain and improve health status. This belief and value of the people of Piagapo had caused an increase in its population from time to time. This is revealed by the different census conducted by NSO in different year. The latest and current population of the municipality as distributed to its 37 barangays is 21,974 as shown in the table below. The average household size is 3.78 or 4 persons per household. But based on 2007 census of population, Piagapo has 5,417 household and the average household size is 6.42. =Population growth rate= The population of Piagapo varies according to the different population census conducted by the NSO, at an increasing trend. In 1995, its total population was 19,198. It increased by about 4,705 or 24.50% in a span of five years. Hence, the annual growth rate between the 1995 and 2000 was 4.5%. In 2007, another census was conducted by the NSO. That census that revealed that Piagapo‚Äôs population was increased to 34,792. Between 2000 and 2007, the population increased by 10,889 or 45.5% for a span of 7 years. Hence, the population growth rates is 6.5% annually, which is very high. However, it was somehow unbelievable and unrealistic, that between 2007 and 2010, The population of Piagapo tremendously declined from 34,792 to 21,974 in just a span of 3 years. The decrease was unusual and very abrupt. The constituents of Piagapo could not believe it, even when some of the residents migrated to other areas in the Philippines temporarily after occurrence of the all-out war against the MILF in the previous years. Economy =Agricultural Products= People of Piagapo are mostly farmers by occupation who generally produce corn, rice as major agricultural products. However, there are few of them who also plant other agricultural products such as trees like mahogany, acacia, and various fruit trees. Vegetables, species and root crops particularly cassava, camote and the like are among the secondary products in the municipality. Due to problem on farm to market road, farmers usually produce mostly for home consumption. =Livestock= Aside from producing agricultural products as the main source of income, some of the residents in the municipality raised carabaos, and cows as working animals. Poultry products such as chicken, duck, and goose are also raised but in limited number and for household consumption only. Raising poultry products is a way of subsidizing the basic needs of the people. Raising livestock like chicken is becoming very discouraging due to lack of knowledge on controlling disease of this livestock. Livestock like carabao and cows are in some cases raised in the community by some well off families, farmers and landlord in limited quantity and mainly as work animal or some times for rent. =Market Outlet= Farm-to-Market road has been a problem almost all over the municipality. Poor road coupled with the absence of Municipal Local Public Market, make it more difficult for the farmers to market their products. The agricultural products are usually marketed either to Saguiaran, Baloi, Lanao del Norte, Pantaoaragat and Iligan City. The decision of the farmers where to market their products is usually dependent on the price offered by the different buyers/middlemen available in the above- mentioned market areas. However, more frequently the price offered is unreasonable. In addition thereto, the expensive transportation cost of products makes farming a losing, discouraging and undesirable low profile venture to the people. Hence, the municipality, in cooperation with other agencies, should give careful attention to these issues and should provide, improve and rehabilitate farm to market road and educate farmers on adoptable agricultural technology and provide a centralized Public Market in a strategic area in the locality where the products of the farmers can be marketed at reasonable fair price and less transportation cost. Local government Engr. Ali L. Sumandar, present Mayor of Piagapo The municipal hall of Piagapo is situated at Barangay Bobo, the first barangay to be reached from Saguiaran, Lanao del Sur, with an area of 11,270 square meter. Elected officials 2016-2019: * Municipal Mayor: Ali L. Sumandar * Vice Mayor: Ansari L. Sumandar * Sangguniang Bayan: ** Cairoding S. Somolong ** Yunos H. Basher ** Waida T. Abbas ** Abdullah Esmail ** Samaira Logi ** Kadafi Tangote ** Junaide Mulok ** Cairoden H. Mostafa * ABC President: Camarudin M. Mulok * SB Secretary: Nasser B. Lumabao =List of former Chief Executives= =Mayors under the 5th Republic= Infrastructure =Transportation= The accessibility and the availability of farm to market roads had been for many years the widely known problems of the people of Piagapo especially those residents from the far flung and interior areas of the municipality which usually use horses as the primary mode of transportation. Though some barangays can somehow be reached through land transportation via Saguiaran, through the long winding provincial road that transverse the municipality, and through barangay road extending from Barangay Kabingan, MSU, Marawi City to Barangay Bobo, Piagapo, most areas are still inaccessible. Not all kinds of vehicle can access the area due to the condition of the provincial road and several barangay roads. The provincial road is segmented road. Some parts are cemented while several portions are still earth fill and impassable or inaccessible like TAPORUG, TALAO, KALUNGUNAN, BAGOA INGUD, LININDING, GACAP, BANGCO, and PALACAT especially during rainy season. They usually use horses as the primary mode of transportation. =Availability of electricity= Availability of electric power has been one of the major problems in Piagapo for a very long period of time. While 20 or 50% of the 37 barangays were provided with electricity by LASURECO, it is undeniable that the supply or availability of electricity in the locality is not regular. In fact, 17 barangays (46%) have been dwelling in darkness for a long period of time and had been longing and very eager to avail to such basic service while the rest are asking for its sustainability. Just recently, last August 2013, the municipality is totally in darkness, no electricity in the whole area of Piagapo. The irregularity of electric power in the municipality does not only hamper the development of the area but also slow down and seriously affect the performance and delivery of some services of the LGU. Moreover, the connection or installation of electric wiring has to be improved to avoid accidents and unwanted events relative to electricity. Education The Department of Education (DepEd) has been exerting effort and great investment to address the needs for quality education and make it available on a vastly wider scale to develop those potentials. Presently, DepEd has the following number schools of different levels addressing the needs for quality education. The municipality of Piagapo is among the depressed areas that are confronted with problems on illiteracy. Illiteracy problem has been obvious in the area which is one among the major factors that hampers development.

Sharif Alawi is the eldest brother of Sharif Kabunsuan. Sharif Alawi and Sharif Kabunsuan came from Johore, a state in Malaysia and firstly landed in Mindanao in the year 1475 at the islet (now Agutayan reef, in Jasaan, Misamis Oriental,http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en‚™´=8.667748&lon;=124.712420&z;=14&m;=b&search;=Tagoloan%2C%20Misamis%20Oriental visible from the seaport of the Municipality of Tagoloan in the Province of Misamis Oriental, Northern Mindanao. Other local moro historian mentioned that these brothers arrived in Mindanao in the year 1464 Sultan Sharif Alawi spread Islam (prior to the arrival of Christianity in Philippine in 1521), in this town towards Surigao, Butuan, Bukidnon, Davao, Lanao del Sur and Norte, stretching towards Misamis Occidental in western Mindanao, while Sultan Sharif Kabunsuan only preached Islam in Maguindanao. The Roman numeral \\"II\\" was added to distinguish the municipality from another municipality with a similar name when Lanao was a single province. Though Lanao was divided into two in 1959, the numeral \\"II\\" has not removed since. Geography It is situated in the northern part of the Province of Lanao del Sur, containing a total land area of 60,214 hectares, more or less.

In the months of October and November, the wind blows either north-west or north-south Generally, the municipality is under the fourth type of climate characterized by even distribution of rainfall through the year. The heaviest rain is experienced in the months of January, May, and July. Dry months are September and November. History =Etymology and origin= Its name was derived from the Maranao word tamparan which literally means \\"frontge.\\" During the American colonial presence in the country Sultan Mangking Sugador was appointed by the American government as Municipal District President, a position equal to the rank of Municipal Mayor, although lesser in power than the latter. When asked by the American Officials about his name, the Sultan said ‚ÄúI am the Sultan of Tamparan,‚Äù referring to the dowa ka lokus-tribal leaders of Tamparan. Sultan Mangking Sugador became popular by his royal title that American officials started calling the town Tamparan. =Declaration= The creation of the Municipality of Tamparan could be traced way back to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines under then-President Manuel L. Quezon. It was in the year 1940 President Quezon issued an Executive Order known as Commonwealth Act No. 592 creating Dansalan (now Marawi City) as a regular municipality and Tamparan as its municipal district covering the areas (now municipalities) of Masiu, Taraka, Poona-Bayabao, Lumba Bayabao, Maguing, Mulondo, Bumbaran and Wao. Tamparan District became a regular municipality on September 28, 1960, by virtue of Executive Order No. 405 and consequently declared Islamic Municipality pursuant to Batas Pambansa (PB) Number 33 on June 4, 1984. Demographics =Language and ethnicity= The majority of the Tamparanian (or Itamparanen in M√´ranaw) traces their roots to Meranao ethnicity although there are also Tagalog, Bisaya and other ethnicities who migrated in the town. The vernacular language is Filipino in the form of M√´ranaw, while Tagalog and English are the languages also widely used in education and business throughout the town. =Religion= The majority of Tamparanian are Muslims. Sunni Islam is the predominant religion and widely practiced. Many people have studied Islamic (Muslim) and Arabic education both within the country and abroad. Other religious groups such as Christian could also be found in town.

Biography  Originally known as Zhang Dianju (), he was born in Weixian, Shandong Province, and worked as a collector of antiques. He was first introduced to the True Jesus Church through his relative Zhang Lingsheng, who came and proselytized in his hometown of Weixian. After hearing Zhang Lingsheng's preaching, Zhang Dianju, a Presbyterian, received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues on 16 March 1912. Paul Wei, often considered the founder of the True Jesus Church, would likewise travel to Weixian in spring 1919. He actively proselytized to members of local Presbyterian churches, establishing local branches of the True Jesus Church. Wei ordained Zhang Lingsheng as bishop of Shandong and Zhang Dianju as elder, and all three would travel throughout many provinces of China and draw in over a thousand members, most of whom came from existing independent, Pentecostal, Seventh Day Adventist, or mainline churches. Many of these new converts would take on new names, including Zhang Dianju who would now be known as Barnabas Zhang. Despite Paul Wei's death in October 1919, the church continued to thrive and grow in the 1920s under two headquarters, one led by , the son of Paul Wei, and the other led by Barnabas Zhang. However, a growing north‚Äìsouth schism developed between the two leaders with Isaac Wei being influential in northern China and Barnabas Zhang becoming increasingly influential in the southern provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, as well as in Taiwan and Chinese communities in Malaya. In a general assembly in 1930, Barnabas Zhang was excommunicated, placing the church under the leadership of Isaac Wei. However, Barnabas Zhang would still lead a number of followers in southern China and southeast Asia under the name the China True Jesus Church () until his death. Barnabas died in Singapore on 25 January 1961.General Board of the TJM, Part 5:Elder Barnabas died.

From \\"Anathomia\\", M. da Luzzi, 1459 A prosector is a person with the special task of preparing a dissection for demonstration, usually in medical schools or hospitals. Many important anatomists began their careers as prosectors working for lecturers and demonstrators in anatomy and pathology. The act of prosecting differs from that of dissecting. A prosection is a professionally prepared dissection prepared by a prosector ‚Äì a person who is well versed in anatomy and who therefore prepares a specimen so that others may study and learn anatomy from it. A dissection is prepared by a student who is dissecting the specimen for the purpose of learning more about the anatomical structures pertaining to that specimen. The term dissection may also be used to describe the act of cutting. Therefore, a prosector dissects to prepare a prosection. Prosecting is intricate work where numerous tools are used to produce a desired specimen. Scalpels and scissors allow for sharp dissection where tissue is cut, e.g. the biceps brachii muscle can be removed from the specimen by cutting the origin and insertion with a scalpel. Probes and the prosector's own fingers are examples of tools used for blunt dissection where tissue may be separated from surrounding structures without cutting, i.e. the bellies of biceps brachii and coracobrachialis muscle were made clearer by loosening the fascia between the two muscles with a blunt probe. Occupational risks Generally, the risks to prosectors are low. Cadavers used for teaching purposes are embalmed before they are encountered by a prosector and students. Embalming fluid usually contains formaldehyde, phenol, Dettol, and glycerine which disinfect and kill pathogens within the cadaver. With exposure to embalming fluid, tissues and bodily fluids, such as blood, become fixed. Prosectors and students working with embalmed cadavers must always wear protective gloves, but that is more for protection against the harsh chemicals used in embalming, such as formaldehyde and Dettol, which can cause moderate to severe skin irritation. Further to the protection that embalming provides against disease, educational institutions take great care in screening the cadavers accepted into their body donation programs. Cadavers are not accepted if they have a medical history of infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Prosectors for autopsies of diseased cadavers may run a high risk of suffering from health problems when caution is not used, because cadavers are not fixed when being dissected for autopsy. At least two diseases are named after prosectors: * Prosector's paronychia: a primary inoculation of tuberculosis of the skin and nails. * Prosector's wart, a skin lesion, also caused by contamination with tuberculous material Contracting infections caused by contaminated cadavers is a constant danger among prosectors, particularly if a skin puncture accident results from the sharp surgical instruments used in this kind of work (about 70% of pathology workers report having at least one percutaneous incident). In those cases, thin surgical gloves do not provide protection. There are many cases of pathologists dying of acute sepsis (blood poisoning) because of that. A famous historical case is that of Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, an Austrian physician, pathologist and physiologist, who infected his finger during an autopsy and, due to the pain, became dependent on morphine and then cocaine, the latter at the instigation of his friend, Sigmund Freud. Presently, AIDS presents a problem. Although it is difficult to contract it by a single puncture incident (the overall personal risk has been estimated to be 0.11%), at least one case has been reported among pathologists. The continuous respiratory exposure to formaldehyde, used to preserve cadavers, is also an occupational risk of prosectors, as well as medical students, anatomists and pathologists. Inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. Formaldehyde is listed as a potential human carcinogen.

It is the successor to the student-run California Aggie Marching Band-uh!, which existed from the 1920's to 2019. In 2018, the Band-uh had roughly 250 members. It performed at home and away games to cheer on the UC Davis Aggies sports teams, marched in parades, and played at events on the UC Davis campus as well as in the surrounding Davis community. UC Davis administrators ordered the permanent dissolution of the Band-uh in the fall of 2019, after accusations of repeated misconduct and an investigation by an outside law firm. At the same time, the university announced formation of a new, university administered organization with the name \\"UC Davis Marching Band.\\"  History  The original UC Davis marching band dates back to 1922, when E. H. Barger of the school's veterinary science department formed an 18-member group. That band disbanded after interest waned. The next incarnation of the band was formed in 1929 by J. Price Gittinger as a pep band for the home football games. There were 15 original members, all male. The first female members joined within two years. In the 1960s, the student body voted to exclude women from the Band-uh! after no women showed up for a game, although also allegedly to give the band a rowdier, more masculine spirit. During the women's rights movement in the early 1970s, pressure mounted to reopen the band to women, in part to comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By 1973, the Band-uh! once again had female members. The Band-uh! has been occasionally associated with controversial and obscene antics. It was reprimanded several times in the 1970s. In 1992 the band was put on probation after a sexual harassment charge was made against the student director. In 2008, the staff director of the band, who is not a student, filed a sexual harassment complaint to the university after several incidents involving the removal of shirts, offensive language and gestures, and lewd behavior.Williams, L.

The band's catalog was composed of its traditional marching songs, such as the Aggie Fight song, as well as renditions of popular rock songs such as Green Day's \\"Welcome to Paradise\\", Edgar Winter's \\"Frankenstein\\", and Jefferson Airplane's \\"White Rabbit\\", among many others. Around April 2019, multiple accusations of hazing, sexual assault, and general misconduct instigated by current members of the now-dissolved Band-uh! and some of its alumni led to an investigation into the band's traditions and their true nature. Five months later, in September 2019, the UC Davis administration issued a public statement officially declaring that the student-run Band-uh! would \\"no longer exist\\" and would restructure the marching band completely, with strict oversight, a faculty director, and an entirely new constitution. The newly-formed 'UC Davis Marching Band' made their public performance debut on September 28, 2019 at a home football game against Montana.  Structure  The Band-uh had an officer council which consisted of 12 student officers, such as the Drum Major, Student Director, and Manager (the Big Three), among others all being equal for voting rights in council meetings. Officers were elected by their peers every year, and served 1 or 2 year terms with the second year requiring a second election. The officer council worked in conjunction with the Faculty director to manage the band. Each section in the band also had 2 section leaders, who managed their sections and were a point of contact between the officer council and the general members. Participation in the Band-uh was open to any student of UC Davis as well as UCD Staff and community members upon approval of the officer council. There was no audition in order to join, and musicians of all experience levels were accepted. The band was an entirely volunteer organization, and members were not compensated by units or scholarship money of any kind. For football games and parades, the Band-uh wore their formal, blue and gold, \\"full dress\\" marching uniforms. For other sports games and most other gigs, members wore their more casual white collared shirt, blue jeans, and button-laden floppy hat outfits, known as the Mav'rik Band uniform. In 2009, the band received new, custom-made full dress uniforms to replace the ones provided for by Warren Mooney in the late 1970s.  Instrumentation  There were 10 instrument sections within the CAMB: Flutes (flutes and piccolos), Nets (clarinets), Altos (alto saxophones), Tenors (tenor saxophones), Baritax (baritone saxophones and baritone horns), Trumpets, Mellos (mellophones), Bones (trombones), Sousies (sousaphones), and Drums (snare drums, bass drums, cymbals, and glockenspiels).  Traditions  The announcement used to present the Band-uh! at every Aggie home game was usually as follows, with occasional minor variations: Fast, furious, and foaming at the mouth, Bold, blue, and bitchin', It's the pride of the Regents of the University of California, The spirit of the Davis Campus, The California Aggie Marching Band-uh!

Java Card is the tiniest of Java platforms targeted for embedded devices. Java Card gives the user the ability to program the devices and make them application specific. It is widely used in ATM cards. The first Java Card was introduced in 1996 by Schlumberger's card division which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto. Java Card products are based on the Java Card Platform specifications developed by Sun Microsystems (later a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation). Many Java card products also rely on the GlobalPlatform specifications for the secure management of applications on the card (download, installation, personalization, deletion). The main design goals of the Java Card technology are portability and security.  Portability  Java Card aims at defining a standard smart card computing environment allowing the same Java Card applet to run on different smart cards, much like a Java applet runs on different computers. As in Java, this is accomplished using the combination of a virtual machine (the Java Card Virtual Machine), and a well- defined runtime library, which largely abstracts the applet from differences between smart cards. Portability remains mitigated by issues of memory size, performance, and runtime support (e.g. for communication protocols or cryptographic algorithms).  Security  Java Card technology was originally developed for the purpose of securing sensitive information stored on smart cards. Security is determined by various aspects of this technology: ; Data encapsulation: Data is stored within the application, and Java Card applications are executed in an isolated environment (the Java Card VM), separate from the underlying operating system and hardware. ; Applet Firewall: Unlike other Java VMs, a Java Card VM usually manages several applications, each one controlling sensitive data. Different applications are therefore separated from each other by an applet firewall which restricts and checks access of data elements of one applet to another. ; Cryptography: Commonly used symmetric key algorithms like DES, Triple DES, AES, and asymmetric key algorithms such as RSA, elliptic curve cryptography are supported as well as other cryptographic services like signing, key generation and key exchange. ; Applet: The applet is a state machine which processes only incoming command requests and responds by sending data or response status words back to the interface device.  Design  At the language level, Java Card is a precise subset of Java: all language constructs of Java Card exist in Java and behave identically. This goes to the point that as part of a standard build cycle, a Java Card program is compiled into a Java class file by a Java compiler; the class file is post-processed by tools specific to the Java Card platform. However, many Java language features are not supported by Java Card (in particular types char, double, float and long; the \`transient\` qualifier; enums; arrays of more than one dimension; finalization; object cloning; threads). Further, some common features of Java are not provided at runtime by many actual smart cards (in particular type \`int\`, which is the default type of a Java expression; and garbage collection of objects). = Bytecode = Java Card bytecode run by the Java Card Virtual Machine is a functional subset of Java 2 bytecode run by a standard Java Virtual Machine but with a different encoding to optimize for size. A Java Card applet thus typically uses less bytecode than the hypothetical Java applet obtained by compiling the same Java source code. This conserves memory, a necessity in resource constrained devices like smart cards. As a design tradeoff, there is no support for some Java language features (as mentioned above), and size limitations. Techniques exist for overcoming the size limitations, such as dividing the application's code into packages below the 64 KiB limit. = Library and runtime = Standard Java Card class library and runtime support differs a lot from that in Java, and the common subset is minimal. For example, the Java Security Manager class is not supported in Java Card, where security policies are implemented by the Java Card Virtual Machine; and transients (non-persistent, fast RAM variables that can be class members) are supported via a Java Card class library, while they have native language support in Java. = Specific features = The Java Card runtime and virtual machine also support features that are specific to the Java Card platform: ; Persistence: With Java Card, objects are by default stored in persistent memory (RAM is very scarce on smart cards, and it is only used for temporary or security-sensitive objects). The runtime environment as well as the bytecode have therefore been adapted to manage persistent objects. ; Atomicity: As smart cards are externally powered and rely on persistent memory, persistent updates must be atomic. The individual write operations performed by individual bytecode instructions and API methods are therefore guaranteed atomic, and the Java Card Runtime includes a limited transaction mechanism. ; Applet isolation: The Java Card firewall is a mechanism that isolates the different applets present on a card from each other. It also includes a sharing mechanism that allows an applet to explicitly make an object available to other applets. = Development = Coding techniques used in a practical Java Card program differ significantly from those used in a Java program. Still, that Java Card uses a precise subset of the Java language speeds up the learning curve, and enables using a Java environment to develop and debug a Java Card program (caveat: even if debugging occurs with Java bytecode, make sure that the class file fits the limitation of Java Card language by converting it to Java Card bytecode; and test in a real Java Card smart card early on to get an idea of the performance); further, one can run and debug both the Java Card code for the application to be embedded in a smart card, and a Java application that will be in the host using the smart card, all working jointly in the same environment.  Versions  Oracle has released several Java Card platform specifications and is providing SDK tools for application development. Usually smart card vendors implement just a subset of algorithms specified in Java Card platform target and the only way to discover what subset of specification is implemented is to test the card. * Version 3.1 (17.12.2018) **Added configurable key pair generation support, named elliptic curves support, new algorithms and operations support, additional AES modes and Chinese algorithms. *Version 3.0.5 (03.06.2015) ** Oracle SDK: Java Card Classic Development Kit 3.0.5u1 (03.06.2015) ** Added support for Diffie-Hellman modular exponentiation, Domain Data Conservation for Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve and DSA keys, RSA-3072, SHA3, plain ECDSA, AES CMAC, AES CTR. * Version 3.0.4 (06.08.2011) ** Oracle SDK: Java Card Classic Development Kit 3.0.4 (06.11.2011) ** Added support for DES MAC8 ISO9797. * Version 3.0.1 (15.06.2009) ** Oracle SDK: Java Card Development Kit 3.0.3 RR (11.11.2010) ** Added support for SHA-224, SHA-2 for all signature algorithms. * Version 2.2.2 (03.2006) ** Oracle SDK: Java Card Development Kit 2.2.2 (03.2006) ** Added support for SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, ISO9796-2, HMAC, Korean SEED MAC NOPAD, Korean SEED NOPAD. * Version 2.2.1 (10.2003) ** Oracle SDK: Java Card Development Kit 2.2.1 (10.2003) * Version 2.2 (11.2002) ** Added support for AES cryptography key encapsulation, CRC algorithms, Elliptic Curve Cryptography key encapsulation,Diffie-Hellman key exchange using ECC, ECC keys for binary polynomial curves and for prime integer curves, AES, ECC and RSA with variable key lengths. * Version 2.1.1 (18.05.2000) ** Oracle SDK: Java Card Development Kit 2.1.2 (05.04.2001) ** Added support for RSA without padding. * Version 2.1 (07.06.1999)  Java Card 3.0  The version 3.0 of the Java Card specification (draft released in March 2008) is separated in two editions: the Classic Edition and the Connected Edition. * The Classic Edition (currently at version 3.0.5 released in June 2015) is an evolution of the Java Card Platform version 2 (which last version 2.2.2 was released in March 2006), which supports traditional card applets on resource-constrained devices such as Smart Cards. Older applets are generally compatible with newer Classic Edition devices, and applets for these newer devices can be compatible with older devices if not referring to new library functions. Smart Cards implementing Java Card Classic Edition have been security-certified by multiple vendors, and are commercially available. * The Connected Edition (currently at version 3.0.2 released in December 2009) aims to provide a new virtual machine and an enhanced execution environment with network-oriented features. Applications can be developed as classic card applets requested by APDU commands or as servlets using HTTP to support web-based schemes of communication (HTML, REST, SOAP ...) with the card. The runtime uses a subset of the Java (1.)6 bytecode, without Floating Point; it supports volatile objects (garbage collection), multithreading, inter-application communications facilities, persistence, transactions, card management facilities ... As of 2017 there has been little adoption in commercially available Smart Cards, so much that reference to Java Card (including in the present wikipedia page) often implicitly excludes the Connected Edition.

As the diester of methanol and sulfuric acid, its formula is often written as (CH3)2SO4 or Me2SO4, where CH3 or Me is methyl. Me2SO4 is mainly used as a methylating agent in organic synthesis. Me2SO4 is a colourless oily liquid with a slight onion-like odour (although smelling it would represent significant exposure). Like all strong alkylating agents, Me2SO4 is extremely toxic. Its use as a laboratory reagent has been superseded to some extent by methyl triflate, CF3SO3CH3, the methyl ester of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. History Dimethyl sulfate was discovered in the early 19th century in an impure form. P. Claesson later extensively studied its preparation. It was used in chemical warfare in WWI. Production Dimethyl sulfate can be synthesized in the laboratory by many different methods, the simplest being the esterification of sulfuric acid with methanol: ::2 CH3OH + H2SO4 ‚Üí (CH3)2SO4 \\\\+ 2 H2O Another possible synthesis involves distillation of methyl hydrogen sulfate: ::2 CH3HSO4 ‚Üí H2SO4 \\\\+ (CH3)2SO4 Methyl nitrite and methyl chlorosulfonate also result in dimethyl sulfate: ::CH3ONO + (CH3)OSO2Cl ‚Üí (CH3)2SO4 \\\\+ NOCl Me2SO4 has been produced commercially since the 1920s. A common process is the continuous reaction of dimethyl ether with sulfur trioxide. ::(CH3)2O + SO3 ‚Üí (CH3)2SO4 Uses Dimethyl sulfate is best known as a reagent for the methylation of phenols, amines, and thiols. One methyl group is transferred more quickly than the second. Methyl transfer is assumed to occur via an SN2 reaction. Compared to other methylating agents, dimethyl sulfate is preferred by the industry because of its low cost and high reactivity. =Methylation at oxygen= Most commonly Me2SO4 is employed to methylate phenols. Some simple alcohols are also suitably methylated, as illustrated by the conversion of tert-butanol to t-butyl methyl ether: ::2 (CH3)3COH + (CH3O)2SO2 ‚Üí 2 (CH3)3COCH3 \\\\+ H2SO4 Alkoxide salts are rapidly methylated: ::RO‚àí Na+ \\\\+ (CH3O)2SO2 ‚Üí ROCH3 \\\\+ Na(CH3)SO4 The methylation of sugars is called Haworth methylation. =Methylation at amine nitrogen= Me2SO4 is used to prepare both quaternary ammonium salts or tertiary amines: ::C6H5CH=NC4H9 \\\\+ (CH3O)2SO2 ‚Üí C6H5CH=N+(CH3)C4H9 \\\\+ CH3OSO3‚àí Quaternized fatty ammonium compounds are used as a surfactant or fabric softeners. Methylation to create a tertiary amine is illustrated as: ::CH3(C6H4)NH2 \\\\+ (CH3O)2SO2 (in NaHCO3 aq.) ‚Üí CH3(C6H4)N(CH3)2 \\\\+ Na(CH3)SO4 =Methylation at sulfur= Similar to the methylation of alcohols, mercaptide salts are easily methylated by Me2SO4: ::RS‚àíNa+ \\\\+ (CH3O)2SO2 ‚Üí RSCH3 \\\\+ Na(CH3)SO4 An example is: ::p-CH3C6H4SO2Na + (CH3O)2SO2 ‚Üí p-CH3C6H4SO2CH3 \\\\+ Na(CH3)SO4 This method has been used to prepare thioesters: ::RC(O)SH + (CH3O)2SO2 ‚Üí RC(O)S(CH3) + HOSO3CH3 =Reactions with nucleic acids= Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) is used to determine the secondary structure of RNA. At neutral pH, DMS methylates unpaired adenine and cytosine residues at their canonical Watson-Crick faces, but it cannot methylate base-paired nucleotides. Using the method known as DMS-MaPseq, RNA is incubated with DMS to methylate unpaired bases. Then the RNA is reverse-transcribed; the reverse transcriptase frequently adds an incorrect DNA base when it encounters a methylated RNA base. These mutations can be detected via sequencing, and the RNA is inferred to be single-stranded at bases with above-background mutation rates. Dimethyl sulfate can effect the base-specific cleavage of DNA by attacking the imidazole rings present in guanine. Dimethyl sulfate also methylates adenine in single-stranded portions of DNA (e.g., those with proteins like RNA polymerase progressively melting and re-annealing the DNA). Upon re-annealing, these methyl groups interfere with adenine-guanine base-pairing. Nuclease S1 can then be used to cut the DNA in single-stranded regions (anywhere with a methylated adenine). This is an important technique for analyzing protein-DNA interactions.  Alternatives  Although dimethyl sulfate is highly effective and affordable, its toxicity has encouraged the use of other methylating reagents. Methyl iodide is a reagent used for O-methylation, like dimethyl sulfate, but is less hazardous and more expensive. Dimethyl carbonate, which is less reactive, has far lower toxicity compared to both dimethyl sulfate and methyl iodide. High pressure can be used to accelerate methylation by dimethyl carbonate. In general, the toxicity of methylating agents is correlated with their efficiency as methyl transfer reagents. Safety Dimethyl sulfate is carcinogenic and mutagenic, highly poisonous, corrosive, and environmentally hazardous. Dimethyl sulfate is absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract, and can cause a fatal delayed respiratory tract reaction. An ocular reaction is also common. There is no strong odor or immediate irritation to warn of lethal concentration in the air. The LD50 (acute, oral) is 205 mg/kg (rat) and 140 mg/kg (mouse), and LC50 (acute) is 45 ppm / 4 hours (rat). The vapor pressure of 65 PaICSC is sufficiently large to produce a lethal concentration in air by evaporation at 20 ¬∞C. Delayed toxicity allows potentially fatal exposures to occur prior to development of any warning symptoms. Symptoms may be delayed 6‚Äì24 hours. Concentrated solutions of bases (ammonia, alkalis) can be used to hydrolyze minor spills and residues on contaminated equipment, but the reaction may become violent with larger amounts of dimethyl sulfate (see ICSC). Although the compound hydrolyses, treatment with water cannot be assumed to decontaminate dimethyl sulfate.

She dedicated the later part of her life to promoting the visual arts in the West of England. A highly accomplished landscape artist in her own right, exhibited at the Royal West of England Academy (RWA), the Royal Academy of Arts, The Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the Medici Gallery, Penwith Gallery, Newlyn Gallery and many others, she is noted for her distinctive, abstractive approach to colour, light and form inspired by the landscapes of the Mediterranean and the western counties of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. Jean Rees (n√©e Jean Lamb) commenced her career by obtaining a National Diploma in Textile Design from the Hastings School of Art, Hastings, East Sussex. Upon completion of this course she embarked on a four-year Open Scholarship with the Royal College of Art but, in 1935, married Glyndwr Rees, moved with him to Somerset and spent the next few years in freelance textile design while raising three children. In 1946 she co-founded the Bridgwater Arts Centre and later became its Chairman. This was an important post-war mile-stone for it was Britain's first art centre, funded by the Arts Council for many years. She was a founder member of the Chandos Society of Artists, later becoming Chairman, and also chaired Artists 303. In 1988 she was elected to the committee of the Royal West of England Academy, Bristol and in 1989 was voted Artist's Chairman, holding this position for 3 years. During her tenure she curated two important exhibitions: the acclaimed \\"Scottish Art in the 20th Century\\" and \\"Painters from Cornwall\\", which marked a time of significant change for RWA. Shortly before her death she was made an Honorary Academician for her services to the RWA. Her paintings are in the permanent collections of the RWA, University of Bath, Somerset County Council and in private collections in Europe, USA and Canada. A retrospective exhibition entitled \\"A Vision of Landscape and Light: Jean Rees Hon RWA 1914 - 2004\\" was staged at Bridgwater Arts Centre and Royal West of England Academy during 2006, receiving enthusiastic praise from several hundred visitors.

A medieval European war wagon was developed in the Hussite Wars around 1420 by Hussite forces rebelling in Bohemia.Arnold, Thomas. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Renaissance at War‚Äô‚Äô. Cassell & Co. 2001. p. 82. It was a heavy wagon given protective sides with firing slits and heavy firepower from either a cannon or a force of hand-gunners, archers and crossbowmen, supported by infantry using spears, pikes and flails. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for formations or as firepower in pincer movements.Arnold, 82. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the Holy Roman Empire's larger forces of mounted knights. After the Hussite wars, they stayed in usage as the special tactical weapon of Bohemian mercenaries which prevailed against knights or foot soldiers. Its successful history came to an end, at least for large scale engagements, with the development of field-piece artillery: a battle wagon wall \\"fortress\\" of approximately 300 wagons was broken at the Battle of Wenzenbach on September 12, 1504 by the culverines (early cannons) and muskets of the landsknecht regiment of Georg von Frundsberg. A separate development were the use of war wagons in China. One of the earliest example of using conjoined wagons in warfare as fortification is described in the Chinese historical record Book of Han. During the 119 BC Battle of Mobei of the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War, the famous Han general Wei Qing led his army through a fatiguing expeditionary march across the Gobi desert only to find Yizhixie chanyu's main force waiting to encircle them on the other side. Using armored heavy wagons known as \\"Wu Gang Wagon\\" () in ring formations as temporary defensive fortifications, Wei Qing neutralised the Xiongnu's initial cavalry charges, forcing a stalemate and buying time for his troops to recover strength, before using the cover of a sandstorm to launch a counteroffensive which overran the nomads.The Book of Han, Ban Gu, 111 CE The Guangwu Emperor (AD 25-57) introduced a ox-pulled war wagon several stories high with an observation tower, which was deployed at the Great Wall against the Xiongnu. By the 6th century such war wagons reached several meters in height and had up to 20 wheels.

He is, as of 2019, the highest ranking judicial official from Mississippi since Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II served on the United States Supreme Court in 1893. Education and career Clark was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Charles and Anita Clark and was the great-grandson of Mississippi Governor Charles Clark (1863‚Äì1865). After being graduated from Cleveland High School (Cleveland, Mississippi), he entered the United States Naval Reserve as an ensign in 1943 and left the Reserve after the end of World War II three years later. He attended law school at the University of Mississippi, where he was a member of Delta Psi fraternity and met his future wife, Emily. He began the practice of law in 1946 in Jackson, Mississippi and continued in private practice for five years, earning a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1948, then rejoined the Naval Reserve as a lieutenant as the Korean War heated up in 1951. He left the Naval Reserve the following year, and resumed his law practice in 1953. Federal judicial service On October 7, 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Clark to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Judge Claude Feemster Clayton. He was confirmed by the United States Senate only eight days later on October 15, 1969 and received his commission two days later. In 1973 and again in 1976, he was recommended to fill vacancies on the United States Supreme Court and each time, he received the American Bar Association's highest qualification. Clark was Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit from 1981 until his retirement from the court on January 15, 1992. He resided in Jackson, Mississippi with his wife Emily until his death on March 6, 2011. In addition to producing more than 2200 opinions, and presiding over the Fifth Circuit for more than ten years, Judge Clark was appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger and again by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body for the federal courts. During his eleven years there, he served as chairman of the Budget Committee and then chairman of the Executive Committee. Honors Clark was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Mississippi College and was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Law School of Ole Miss in the spring of 2009. Notable clerks * Leslie H.

Background Kerry Livgren in 1976Throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, Kerry Livgren had been guitarist, keyboardist, and principal composer for the successful American rock band, Kansas. During his tenure with the group, he had explored numerous eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. These themes often appeared in the lyrics to songs on early Kansas records such as Kansas, Song for America, and Masque. Livgren became a born-again Christian in 1979, followed by Kansas bassist Dave Hope in 1980. The change of lyrical direction in Audio-Visions due to Livgren's conversion began to create a rift between the members of Kansas. The strong focus that Livgren placed on his Christian faith in lyrics of songs to be recorded for Vinyl Confessions, especially in \\"Crossfire\\", turned out to be the last straw for Kansas's original lead vocalist Steve Walsh, who left Kansas to form the band Streets in 1981. The remaining Kansas members held numerous auditions to select a new lead vocalist that could effectively replace Steve Walsh's songwriting and singing skills. Eventually, John Elefante was hired as Walsh's replacement, but hopefuls Warren Ham and Michael Gleason left an impression on Kerry Livgren, who was in the process of writing material for a second solo album for CBS Records. Instead of using different musicians for each song as he had done on his 1980 solo album Seeds of Change, he would put together a single group consisting of himself, Dave Hope, Warren Ham, Michael Gleason and Dennis Holt. During Kansas's time with John Elefante as lead vocalist and keyboardist, Livgren became increasingly uncomfortable with Kansas representing his Christian worldview. After a final New Year's Eve performance on December 31, 1983, Livgren and Hope left the band. 1983-1984: A new band - Time Line In 1983, after Livgren's departure from Kansas, he finished recording his second self-produced album for CBS, Time Line, with himself on guitar and keyboard, Hope on bass, Ham on saxophone, flute, harmonica and vocals, Gleason on vocals, keyboards and guitar and Holt on drums. During sessions for the album, it became apparent that the musicians shared many interests, not the least of which was their Christian faith. After years of feeling isolated and artistically stifled in Kansas, Livgren found working with fellow Christians refreshing. By the end of the recording sessions, the session musicians had jelled, and Livgren decided to name the group AD. Time Line was released in 1984 and credited to Kerry Livgren/AD. It received virtually no promotion from CBS Records, who probably saw the side project as a threat to the continued success of Kansas. Due to legal entanglements caused by his contractual obligations with Kansas, Livgren was unable to market AD in the mainstream secular market. After negotiating with the record label, he received a waiver to perform with AD in the Christian rock market. This would become a hindrance to commercial viability for the band. 1985-1988: Art of the State to Prime Mover AD toured extensively between 1983 and 1985, sometimes playing bars and clubs one night and then churches the next. Livgren has stated on several occasions that he experienced some of the highest and lowest points in his career during his time with AD. Livgren mentions in his book Seeds of Change: The Spiritual Quest of Kerry Livgren that his time playing live with AD was his best as a guitarist. Art of the State was released in 1985 on Livgren's own Christian label, Kerygma Records, distributed by Sparrow Records, and was the first album credited to the band name AD. The group began touring, but were quickly discouraged by a lack of professionalism in the Christian venues. After the tour, Ham left the band, and the remaining four members decided to produce one more album before ending AD. Gleason was left to handle the lead vocals alone on the next album, appropriately titled Reconstructions. Due to financial difficulties, AD faded away in 1986 after its release, even though no official breakup was announced. In an interview, Livgren said that AD played its last gig in Detroit on December 31, 1985 but never received any more requests for shows after that, so the members just drifted off into other projects. Although AD had been unofficially disbanded for two years, Livgren and Ham put together one more album to pay off band bills, with the band name reverting to Kerry Livgren/AD. Released in 1988, Prime Mover was a collection of previously unreleased AD songs. Livgren played all instruments, and all vocals were performed by Ham. 1989‚Äìpresent: Recent activity In 1992, Livgren released a double-CD retrospective titled Decade, celebrating 10 years since his first solo recording. It included Livgren's first two solo albums Seeds of Change and Time Line in their entirety, plus tracks from other albums, including Art of the State, Prime Mover and One of Several Possible Musiks, and previously unreleased songs. In the late 1990s, Livgren re-released Art of the State on his new independent record label, Numavox Records. A partially re-recorded version of Reconstructions was also released in 1997. In 1997, Livgren discovered recordings of two AD performances from 1984 and 1985 that had been made by the soundboard engineer during the Art of the State tour. Though the recordings had not been made for release, Livgren remastered them and released them as a \\"thank you\\" to fans on a CD-R title called AD Live. The performances include mistakes and technical problems left intact and is meant as an archival release. In 1998, Livgren mostly re-recorded Prime Mover and added five new songs and a new version of \\"Fair Exchange\\" from the Kansas album Vinyl Confessions in the reissue, Prime Mover II. Shortly after the release of the Kansas album Somewhere to Elsewhere in 2000, Livgren began work on the album The Best of Kerry Livgren. Both retrospective and forward-looking, it contains tracks from all his solo releases and some AD tracks. The album also includes two new songs and new recordings of four older songs. Each of these new versions features the original vocalists, including Ham, Gleason, and Ronnie James Dio. In 2008, Livgren reworked and reissued Prime Mover again as Prime Mover (Redux). Books A revised and expanded edition of Livgren's 1985 autobiography, Seeds of Change: The Spiritual Quest of Kerry Livgren, co- written with Kenneth Boa, was released in 1991 that updated the book to cover his time with AD.

A British column under Lord Methuen, that was attempting to relieve the besieged town of Kimberley, forced Boers under General Piet Cronj√© to retreat to Magersfontein, but suffered heavy casualties themselves. Background When the war broke out, one of the Boers' early targets was the diamond-mining centre of Kimberley, which stood not far from the point where the borders of the Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, and the British-controlled Cape Colony met. Although their forces surrounded the town, they did not press home any immediate assault. Nor did they attempt to cross the Orange River on this front to invade Cape Colony. Meanwhile, British reinforcements were on their way to South Africa. Their commander, General Sir Redvers Buller detached the 1st Division under Lieutenant General Lord Methuen to relieve the Siege of Kimberley. This decision was made partly for reasons of prestige, as the capture of Kimberley (which contained the famous Imperialist and former Prime Minister of Cape Colony, Cecil Rhodes) would be a major propaganda victory for the British. During November, Methuen's force advanced north along the Western Cape Railway. They fought and won two engagements against Boers from the Orange Free State under General Prinsloo at the Battle of Belmont and at Graspan. At least one American, Lance Corporal Hollon Bush of the 7th Company, First Battalion Coldstream Guards was present and wounded at the Battle of Modder River. His journey to enlist from departure in New Orleans to England was not without many pitfalls before beginning service at the Tower of London, then on to Gibraltar and South Africa. =Boer plans= Battle of Modder River The Boers had been reinforced by a substantial contingent from the Transvaal under General Koos de la Rey, who proposed a radical new plan of defence. He pointed out that the Boers had previously been easily driven from the kopjes (hills) which they had occupied. The kopjes had been obvious aiming marks for the numerically superior British artillery. Also, the trajectory of rifle fire from Boers on the top of the kopjes was steeply plunging. It therefore had a chance of hitting its target only in the last six feet or so of its flight. Once British infantry had reached the foot of the kopje, they were concealed by boulders and scrub, and could then easily drive the Boers off the summit with the bayonet. De la Rey proposed to make use of the flat trajectory of the Mauser rifle with which the Boers were armed, together with the flat veld. He called on his men to dig trenches in the banks of the Modder River, from which their rifles could sweep the veld for a great distance, and won them over. General Piet Cronje, who arrived later with the main Boer force, acquiesced in this novel plan. The area contained two prominent hotels and the village of Rosmead, which was used as a resort by prominent businessmen from Kimberley. The Boer trenches were at on the south side of the Modder and the smaller Riet River which joined it at Modder River Station. The Boers had six field guns and one Maxim \\"pom-pom\\" (small rapid-firing gun) from the Orange Free State's Staatsartillerie (state artillery). They deployed these not as a concentrated battery, but as widely separated individual gun detachments north of the Modder and to the east. They had dug several emplacements for each gun, allowing their guns to switch position to avoid counter-battery fire. =British plans= Methuen's force consisted of two infantry brigades (the Guards Brigade under Major-General Sir Henry Edward Colville and the 9th Brigade under Major-General Reginald Pole-Carew), two mounted regiments, three batteries of field artillery (18th, 62nd and 75th) and four guns of the Naval Brigade. Further reinforcements were arriving up the railway. The British cavalry (the 9th Lancers and a unit recruited in Cape Town, Rimington's Guides), made some attempts to scout the ground ahead of the army, but failed entirely to detect De la Rey's trenches and other preparations. (For example, the Boers had whitewashed stones on the veld or had placed biscuit tins as range markers). At 4:30 am on 28 November, Methuen's force roused itself, deployed into line and began advancing towards the Modder, with no plans other than to cross the river before having breakfast on the far side. Battle As the British troops came within of the river, Methuen remarked to Colville, \\"They're not here.\\" Colville replied, \\"They're sitting uncommonly tight if they are\\".Rayne Kruger, Goodbye Dolly Gray, p.117 At this point the Boers opened fire. Most of the British troops were forced to throw themselves flat. Some tried to advance in short rushes, but could find no cover on the veld. Few British troops got closer than to the Boers. The Guards tried to outflank the Boer left, but were unable to ford the Riet River. The British guns pounded the buildings near Modder River Station and the line of poplar trees which marked the north bank of the Modder, and entirely missed the enemy trenches on the south bank. Meanwhile, the Boer guns maintained a galling fire, and kept in action by repeatedly moving their positions. The battle became a day-long stalemate. Most of the British infantry lay prone on the veld, tortured by heat and thirst, but safe from enemy fire unless they moved. Many stoically smoked pipes or even slept. Methuen galloped about the field trying to renew the advance, and was himself wounded. At midday, some of Pole-Carew's 9th Brigade found the open Boer right flank at Rosmead drift (ford) downstream. British infantry infiltrated across the ford and about 1:00 pm drove the Boers out of Rosmead.Pakenham, p 204 The attack was disjointed, and suffered casualties when a British field artillery battery (62nd) which had just arrived on the field shelled them by mistake. By nightfall, De la Rey had driven them back into a small insecure bridgehead. Nevertheless, the Boers feared that they were now vulnerable to being outflanked, and withdrew during the night. Aftermath Methuen reported that the battle had been \\"one of the hardest and most trying fights in the annals of the British army\\".Rayne Kruger, Goodbye Dolly Gray, p.119 Although casualties had not been cripplingly heavy (between 450 and 480), mainly because the Boers opened fire prematurely, it was clear that any simple frontal attack by infantry only against an enemy using bolt-action rifles, was effectively impossible. The British were forced to pause for ten days, to evacuate their casualties, receive further reinforcements and repair their lines of communications. The delay allowed the Boers to construct the entrenchments which they were to defend in the Battle of Magersfontein. On the Boer side, there were about 80 casualties, including, Adriaan, the eldest son of Koos de la Rey, mortally wounded by a shell.

Mixminion can send and receive anonymous e-mail. Mixminion uses a mix network architecture to provide strong anonymity, and prevent eavesdroppers and other attackers from linking senders and recipients. Volunteers run servers (called \\"mixes\\") that receive messages, decrypt them, re-order them, and re-transmit them toward their eventual destination. Every e-mail passes through several mixes so that no single mix can link message senders with recipients. To send an anonymous message, mixminion breaks it into uniform-sized chunks (also called \\"packets\\"), pads the packets to a uniform size, and chooses a path through the mix network for each packet. The software encrypts every packet with the public keys for each server in its path, one by one. When it is time to transmit a packet, mixminion sends it to the first mix in the path. The first mix decrypts the packet, learns which mix will receive the packet, and relays it. Eventually, the packet arrives at a final (or \\"exit\\") mix, which sends it to the chosen recipient. Because no mix sees any more of the path besides the immediately adjacent mixes, they cannot link senders to recipients. Mixminion supports Single-Use Reply Blocks (or SURBs) to allow anonymous recipients. A SURB encodes a half-path to a recipient, so that each mix in the sequence can unwrap a single layer of the path, and encrypt the message for the recipient. When the message reaches the recipient, the recipient can decode the message and learn which SURB was used to send it; the sender does not know which recipient has received the anonymous message.

The channel provides 24-hour news coverage primarily focused on Washington, D.C., northern Virginia and suburban areas of Maryland within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The channel shares studio facilities and offices with WJLA-TV and the Rosslyn-based Circa News in Arlington, Virginia. WJLA 24/7 News reaches more than 1.2 million cable television households within the D.C metropolitan area. History The channel was launched on October 7, 1991 as NewsChannel 8. The \\"8\\" branding was selected as a part of the name to attempt to get Washington-area cable providers to place the channel between its parent ABC-affiliated station, WJLA-TV (at channel 7), and local CBS affiliate WUSA-TV on channel 9. Allbritton also bundled the channel along with WJLA in carriage contracts. In 1995, the channel began airing timeshifted ABC News programs hours or days after their original broadcast. NewsChannel 8 initially only had ad revenue stream until federal regulations required cable operators to pay for its carriage. In 1997, the channel was reported as profitable and started a streak of profitability by Allbritton. As NewsChannel 8's carriage expanded to those areas, coverage was expanded to include Southern Maryland and Prince William County governmental meetings by the end of the 1990s. In July 2001, NewsChannel 8 beat CNN, Headline News, MSNBC and CNBC in the ratings, the highest viewership that the channel had ever accrued in its first 10 years. In August 2001, Comcast agreed to carry the channel for another 10 years. In August 2002, Allbritton Communications merged NewsChannel 8 and WJLA-TV with NewsChannel 8 laying off 30 of its 125 staff. The channel in Springfield and station in Northwest Washington moved to a Rosslyn section twin towers office complex in Arlington, Gannett Co. and USA Today's former home. Former logo as NewsChannel 8, used from October 7, 1991 to August 9, 2010 and from February 1, 2011 to July 24, 2018. On September 5, 2006, Comcast moved NewsChannel 8, at the channel's request, to channel 28 on the analog tiers of some of its systems, placing it next to sister station WJLA-TV on channel 27 (Comcast's systems in the immediate Washington, D.C. area slot the market's broadcast stations in the 20-29 channel range; this is an artifact from when television stations broadcast in analog prior to the 2009 digital television transition in order to avert co-channel interference with the broadcast signals). Systems outside of Washington, D.C. proper carry it on channel 8, next to WJLA on channel 7. In all cases, however, the channel's high definition feed is carried on digital channel 808. On July 17, 2013, satellite provider DirecTV began carrying NewsChannel 8 on channel 8 within the Washington, D.C. market. On December 21, 2015, the channel was added to satellite provider Dish Network's D.C.-area broadcast lineup, also on channel 8. On August 9, 2010, the channel was rebranded as TBD TV, in order to associate it with the recently established news website TBD.com, which provided news content for both the channel and WJLA. Allbritton subsequently reverted its news channel's branding to the original NewsChannel 8 name in February 2011. On July 29, 2013, Allbritton Communications announced that it would sell its entire television group, including NewsChannel 8 and WJLA-TV, to Hunt Valley-based Sinclair Broadcast Group (owners of flagship station WBFF, as well as operators of two other stations in the adjacent Baltimore market). Sinclair had indicated that it may use NewsChannel 8 as a base to launch a national cable news channel. On July 23, 2018, WJLA announced that NewsChannel 8 will be rebranded as WJLA 24/7 News on Tuesday July 24, aligning it further with the call letters of its broadcast station, WJLA-TV. Programming The NewsChannel 8 studio with its logo in background Through a fiber optic delivery system, NewsChannel 8 provided programming and advertising targeted at three separate geographical regions of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and was once known for airing specific \\"Zone Reports\\" on weeknights to these regions, including \\"The Washington Report\\" (featuring news stories affecting the District of Columbia), \\"The Virginia Report\\" (featuring news stories from northern Virginia) and \\"The Maryland Report\\" (featuring news from communities in adjacent suburban areas of Maryland). The appropriate edition was fed to each of the cable systems in the region. The newscasts were all the same, except for the second segment (aired between the first and second commercial breaks), which was specifically tailored to each \\"zone.\\" The channel ended this practice in 2009. WJLA 24/7 News employs its own anchors and certain meteorologists while sharing reporting and weather staffers with WJLA-TV. The two news operations share the same on-air news staffers for the weekend evening newscasts aired respectively by the cable channel and television station. The channel (along with its sister broadcast station) operates a bureau in Washington, D.C. When it is not airing newscasts, WJLA 24/7 News airs encore presentations of ABC News programs as well as various local programs, including Let's Talk Live (an hour-long call-in talk show, airing at 10:00 a.m. with a repeat at 12:00 p.m.), \\"Government Matters\\" (a news show geared towards federal government employees and contractors and the \\"business of government\\"), and SportsTalk (a sports discussion program). Unlike most regional news channels which air newscasts during overnights and weekends on a recorded loop, WJLA 24/7 News airs some paid programming during certain timeslots within those periods. Previous talk shows included Moms Talk (a Monday morning advice show hosted by two housewives), the Wednesday movie review Entertainment Forecast show, NewsTalk (a live hour-long daily call-in show featuring prominent newsmakers), Capital Insider (a political discussion program), Goss' Garage (a Saturday morning automotive program), The Arch Campbell Show (an entertainment news program) and Capital Golf Weekly (a program featuring golf instruction and feature reports on the sport). In 2015, D.C. United of Major League Soccer reached a new multi-year deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group to broadcast all 26 of the team's regional matches on then NewsChannel 8 and WJLA, succeeding CSN Mid-Atlantic.

At only six weeks old, Kenan moved to Duplin County, North Carolina, a small rural community, where he lived with his grandparents in a small town named Wallace. The settings of many of Kenan's novels are centered around his home area of North Carolina. The focus of much of Kenan's work centers around what it means to be black and gay in the southern United States. Some of Kenan's most notable works include the collection of short stories Let the Dead Bury Their Dead, named a New York Times Notable Book in 1992, A Visitation of Spirits, and The Fire This Time. Kenan was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Award, and the John Dos Passos Prize. Biography =Early life= Randall Kenan was born in Brooklyn, New York, but at only six weeks old he moved to a small town named Wallace where he lived with his grandparents. Kenan's grandparents ran a dry-cleaning business, and most of the time they were too busy to take care of Kenan themselves, so they hired someone to take care of him. On the weekends, Kenan's great-aunt Mary and great-uncle Redden would take him to their family farm which was located in Chinquapin, only about 15 miles east of Wallace. At three years old Kenan's great-uncle Redden died unexpectedly, and Kenan's grandfather suggested to his great-aunt Mary that she keep Kenan because she was alone. Kenan recalled the conversation and after that he remained with his great-aunt Mary for the remainder of his adolescent years. Kenan's great-aunt Mary, whom he eventually called 'mama,' became a mentor for him, and she taught him how to read at the age of four. Mary was a kindergarten teacher so she heavily supported education and began Kenan's education at a young age. He grew up loving to read everything ranging from novels to comic books to the Bible, and he eventually developed a love for storytelling. Kenan attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, beginning in the fall of 1981 and he graduated in 1985 with degrees in English and Creative Writing. In his freshman year of college Kenan was pursuing a physics degree, but found himself confused on what to pursue because he was not enjoying his classes. He then decided to enroll in a writing class led by Max Steele, who is an editor for The Paris Review. Kenan also studied with the author Doris Betts, who tried to get Kenan a job in publishing in New York City. Her efforts were not immediately successful, and it was not until a few months after graduation that Kenan received an offer to work for the book publisher Random House in New York City. =Professional life= Kenan was hired at Random House originally because the company \\"had gotten into trouble with the Equal Opportunity Commission\\" and they wanted to increase the number of minorities they had working at the company. After doing odd jobs at Random House, Kenan was able to secure a job at Alfred A. Knopf as a receptionist, where he had opportunities to study his craft. Kenan worked at Knopf for only two months before he was promoted to assistant to the executive vice president, where he remained in that position for five years. While in the assistant position, until 1989, Kenan had the opportunity to edit dozens of books, which helped him improve in his own craft of storytelling. The experience working at Knopf helped Kenan in finalizing what would become his first published novel, A Visitation of Spirits, in 1989. After publishing A Visitation of Spirits, Kenan began teaching at three universities part time. He taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University, and Vassar College once a week each, which gave him plenty of time to work on his own writing. Kenan was a full time professor of English at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He also served as a visiting writer or writing in residence at a number of other universities, including the University of Mississippi, the University of Memphis, Duke University, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. =Writings= Kenan's first novel, A Visitation of Spirits, was published in 1989. While a few critics praised the book, it did not receive much attention, but his situation changed with the publication in 1992 of Kenan's second book, a collection of short stories titled Let the Dead Bury Their Dead. The stories, based in the fictional community of Tims Creek, focused on (among other things) what it meant to be poor, black, and gay in the southern United States. The book was hailed as a revival of classic southern literature and was nominated for the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Fiction, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named a New York Times Notable Book. The short story collection also brought renewed attention to his first novel, which was likewise set in Tims Creek. In 1993, Kenan published a young adult biography of gay African American novelist and essayist James Baldwin. Kenan frequently stated that Baldwin was one of his idols. He then spent several years traveling across the United States and Canada collecting oral histories of African Americans, which he published in Walking on Water: Black American Lives at the Turn of the Twenty-first Century (1999). Kenan won a number of writing awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Award, the Sherwood Anderson Award, the John Dos Passos Prize, and the Rome Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2007 Kenan published The Fire This Time, a book whose title was taken from James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. It is a work of nonfiction. In August 2020, Kenan published If I Had Two Wings, a short story collection.https://wwnorton.com/books/If-I-Had- Two-Wings At his death he left an unfinished book, There's a Man Going 'Round Taking Names.
