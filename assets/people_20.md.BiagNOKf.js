Alor specializes in designing, creating expensive cable pieces. It is headquartered in San Diego, California. History Alor was founded in 1979 in California by Jack Zemer, a former nuclear engineer at General Electric, and his wife, Sandy Zemer. Alor was named by combining the first names of the couple‚Äôs sons, Tal and Ori, who are now both Principals and Presidents of the company and oversee all aspects of the business. Alor first publicly displayed its nautical cable motif jewelry in the early 1980s. Each Alor piece is handcrafted. From 1970 to 1992, Alor sold stainless steel cable, 18-karat gold and diamond jewelry under the \\"Alor\\" name. In 1992, Alor began a partnership with Phillipe Charriol International and formed Charriol USA. While ALOR International Ltd. remained the parent company, all Alor jewelry designs were sold throughout and U.S. and the Caribbean as Charriol USA. The partnership ended in early 2014, with ALOR International Ltd. reverting to their original brand name of Alor. For the rebranding, the company released a national advertising campaign featuring model Noot Seear and photographed by Justin Coit. International expansion began in 2012 and now Alor sells to retailers in Dubai, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Australia. In 2013, Ori and Tal Zemer launched Alor Swiss Watches, featuring details such as stainless steel cable bands and 18-karat gold and diamond embellishments. In 2015, Alor released its Black Label jewelry collection. The Black Label pieces are made in 18-karat gold and feature overlapping circles and ovals set with rubies and black, colorless, and canary diamonds.

His initial film career started off as a ticket checker in the Natraj film theatrehttp://karaikudi.info/blog/nataraja-theatre-karaikudi/ in Karaikudi. Then he advanced to become the owner of the same theatre. This was followed by a series of successes which made him start a film distribution unit called 'Venkateshwara Films' in the Thirunalveli district of Tamil Nadu. After that turned out to be a success, he proceeded to Madurai and started another unit called 'Vaideki movies ' as a partnership with noted producer, lyricist and writer Panju Arunachalam. He kept closing and opening distribution units due to internal problems. He retired from film distribution at the end of the 20th century due to chronic health problems.  Early life  Shanmugam was born to Subbaiah, a rich businessman, and Seethai, a rich landlady belonging to the Ilupakudi village, in the Karaikudi district of Tamil Nadu. His mother died some time after his birth and his father married another woman. He was hated by his stepmother who did not even give him food to eat. He was a talented boy and was also a star footballer in his school, but he had to discontinue schooling due to lack of support. He was born a rich boy but live like a poor one. His aunt bore witness to this and made him stay at her house in Aravayal. His uncle got him the job of a ticket checker at the Natraj theater, following his interest in the cinema industry. Due to his determination and hard work, he was liked by the theater owner and was eventually given the post of manager. And thus, he started his film career. Shanmugam married Manimeghalai of Kandadevi, a village adjoining his hometown and moved to a rented flat in Thirunalveli. He had five children in all. He started a film distribution circuit called ‚ÄòVenkateshwara films‚Äô as a joint venture. It was a success . This was his first attempt at distribution. Then he started his lone distribution project in the form of ‚ÄòPriya films‚Äô. That too was a success. He received a big income and distributed a large number of films. He wanted to replicate his success at an even bigger scale. So he closed that unit and from the rented flat of Thirunalveli, he shifted to his own house in Madurai. In Madurai, he started a distribution company called ‚ÄòVaideki movies‚Äô with Panju Arunachalam as a partner. It was a major hit. He mostly distributed films of Actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. He had also distributed the films of Actors Sivaji Ganesan and MG Ramachandran from his previous unit, including the super hit Sivaji film ‚ÄòVazhkai‚Äô. He closed this unit and started another one called ‚ÄòGayathri films‚Äô. This was his last unit and that too was a major hit.  Problems  It was his film career, which brought him his fortune, that caused his downfall. The tension and pressure of success prevented him from sleeping and breathing properly. This made him take overdoses of sleeping tablets. This cost him dearly in his later days. He lost his hearing and could only see partially. He could not walk properly. His neural system got damaged severely. He tried to fight it but could not. He died on 26 May 2012.

While working at Sun Microsystems he was the primary developer of Hudson project. He is also the recipient of the 2011 Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award for his work on the Jenkins project.  Career  He worked at Sun Microsystems on numerous projects for the Java, XML and Solaris ecosystems, notably as the primary developer for Hudson and for Multi Schema Validator. Hudson was created in summer of 2004 and first released in February 2005. When Oracle bought Sun, an issue arose in the Hudson community with respect to the infrastructure used, which grew to encompass questions over the stewardship and control by Oracle. Negotiations between the principal project contributors and Oracle took place, and although there were many areas of agreement a key sticking point was the trademarked name \\"Hudson\\", after Oracle claimed the right to the name and applied for a trademark in December 2010. As a result, on January 11, 2011, a call for votes was made to change the project name from \\"Hudson\\" to \\"Jenkins\\". The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by community vote on January 29, 2011, creating the Jenkins project. Alt URL On February 1, 2011, Oracle said that they intended to continue development of Hudson, and considered Jenkins a fork rather than a rename. Jenkins and Hudson therefore continue as two independent projects, each claiming the other is the fork. Kawaguchi founded InfraDNA, Inc. in April 2010, which provided support and service for continuous integration using Hudson. On November 2010, InfraDNA merged with CloudBees. In 2011, he received Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award for his work on the Hudson/Jenkins projects. In 2014, Kawaguchi became the Chief Technology Officer for CloudBees.

Iraca can also refer to the Iraka Valley over which they ruled. Life of Alexander von Humboldt - Ciudad de Santa Fe Important scholars who wrote about the iraca were Lucas Fern√°ndez de Piedrahita, Alexander von Humboldt and Ezequiel Uricoechea.  Background  Sun Temple of Sugamuxi, where the iraca lived In the centuries before the Spanish conquistadores entered central Colombia in the 1530s, the valleys of the Eastern Ranges were ruled by four main leaders and several independent caciques. The northern territories were ruled by the zaque from Hunza, the present-day capital of Boyac√° department and the southern area under the reign of the zipa, based in Bacat√°, currently known as the Colombian capital Bogot√°. Other important rulers were the iraca and the cacique Tundama based in Tundama, today known as the city of Duitama. The Muisca were one of the four advanced civilizations of the Americas, between the Aztec and Maya civilization in the north and the Incas south of Colombia.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2007, p.52  Description  Sugamuxi, the last iraca The iraca was a cacique of the sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi, present-day Sogamoso. His domain was a territory spreading over Sogamoso, Pesca, Iza, Tobas√≠a, Firavitoba, Busbanz√°, Toca, G√°meza, Tota, Mongua and areas adjacent to Lake Tota. Iraca rulers - Pueblos Originarios The iraca was both a political and a religious leader (priest), in the religion of the Muisca said to have descended from Idacans√°s and educated by messenger god Bochica. It is thought that the iracas inherited the knowledge of Bochica from their predecessors. Sugamuxi - Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas The role of iraca was widely respected in the Muisca territories and also was important for the astronomy of the Muisca.Langebaek Rueda et al., 2005, p.281 The iraca was elected by the caciques of G√°meza, Busbanz√°, Pesca and Toca. Generally a cacique from Tobas√≠a or Firavitoba was elected alternatingly. In cases where the election was indecisive, the tundama of Tundama would intervene. The iraca of Sugamuxi lived in the Sun Temple, the most important temple of the Muisca, built to worship the Muisca Sun god Su√©, in Sugamuxi, decorated inside with golden figures; tunjos and golden plates outside. Official website Sogamoso The Sun Temple was destroyed by fire from the torches of soldiers in the army of Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, the conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca in September 1537 in search of El Dorado.

Prevalent in North and South America, the genus Nacobbus threatens crops such as tomato, potato, quinoa and sugarbeet. They can cause so much damage that they are considered to be of quarantine importance. The morphology and biology of Nacobbus is not all that well known, although it is possible that the host‚Äîin this case, a specific crop‚Äîinfluences how the morphological characteristics of these nematodes are expressed. Species Classification Two type species of Nacobbus, Nacobbus aberrans and Nacobbus dorsalis, were identified in 1944 by Thorne and Allen along with two additional possible species, N. batatiformis and N. serendipiticus. In 1970, Sher classified N. batatiformis and N. serendipiticus under the species Nacobbus aberrans. N. aberrans and N. dorsalis were concluded to be the only two species of Nacobbus and were differentiated by morphological characteristics. Today, the classification of Nacobbus into these two species is generally accepted as accurate. However, recent studies focused on morphology and host-range suggest that this classification may need to be reevaluated. Proper classification of the genus is crucial in order to most effectively manage and quarantine them. Life Cycle In terms of feeding strategy, Nacobbus is classified as a false root-knot nematode because it is both migratory endoparasitic and sedentary endoparasitic. It is the only known nematode to do so; all others employ either one strategy or the other. In Nacobbus, each strategy is employed at different stages in the life cycle. Immature males and females are migratory whereas mature females are sedentary. The life cycle of Nacobbus begins when they hatch from eggs in the soil and migrate through roots and soil until mature, causing necrotic lesions. Then, mature females form a feeding site called a syncytium, which is composed of plant material and formed in healthy root tissue. There the females produce eggs and lay them in the soil to hatch.

The seat of Pilbara was won by the Labor candidate, Pam Buchanan, with a large margin.

He also wrote under the pen names V. Warin and Victor.  Biography  Destined by his father to the profession of notary, Varin spent ten years at the bottom of a study, where he once came to Paris without money. Interested in writing plays, he spent a long time to break the circle of obstacles which opposed its inception. When the first success came, around 1825, he called himself Victor first, then took the pseudonym Varin, so that his father kept in ignorance of its gains, would not suppress his student pension. After he made his way to the stage, it provided very regularly plays, usually vaudevilles, full of gaiety and movement. He wrote mostly in company with various authors. To cite only a few: Bayard, Clairville, Desvergers, Paul de Kock, Duvert, Labiche, Auguste Lefranc, Henri Rochefort, √âtienne and Jacques Arago. In August 1864 he was awarded the Legion of Honour.Le dossier individuel ne figure pas dans la Base L√©onore.

He was posthumously awarded the \\"Hero of Artsakh\\" which is the highest honorary title of semi-recognized NKR. Abajyan is the youngest person to be awarded the title at 19 years old. Abajyan fought for several hours against special forces groups of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces during the Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani clashes of 2016 in the northeast line of contact on the night of 1‚Äì2 April. After finding himself alone and against larger enemy numbers, he showed as if he was giving up, however when Azeri groups were approaching he pulled out a grenade and blew up the approaching Azeri soldiers with himself. For his actions shown in the course of defending the borders of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, on 8 May 2016, Abajyan was posthumously awarded the Golden Eagle Order granted the highest Honorary Title of the \\"Hero of Artsakh\\". Biography =Early life= Abajyan was born in 1996 in Yerevan. In 2003 he attended Yerevan's Basic School No. 147 in Kanaker-Zeytun District. He graduated in 2012 and attended Yerevan State Basic Medical College which he graduated in 2014 with a degree in Dental technology. He then attended Medical Institute named after Mother Teresa later same year. =Military service= Abajyan went to compulsory military service in 2014. Due to high military performance, he was promoted to junior sergeant. Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani clashes On the night of 1‚Äì2 April 2016 along the northeastern part of the NKR-Azerbaijan contact line units of Azerbaijani Armed Forces carried out large-scale attacks against the Armenian side. After the use of artillery, groups of Azerbaijani forces commenced an infantry attack. Under the leadership of captain Armenak Urfanyan, a smaller number of Armenian border soldiers started to provide heavy resistance. After two failed attempts of penetration and a loss of a tank, Azeri forces withdrew to their initial positions and resumed the artillery bombardments on the contact line. Captain Urfanyan and Yazidi-Armenian machine-gunner Kyaram Sloyan were soon killed. After the death of the commander, Robert Abajyan, who had suffered a wound in his leg by that time, took upon himself to proceed with the resistance. After the penetration of Azeri forces inside the line, he brought his wounded comrade machine-gunner Andranik Zohrabyan into the trench cell, which was located at a distance of 30 meters (98 feet). In the trench cell Abajyan contacts with the battalion commander and provides valuable information on the operational situation. He informed about possible dangers to the commander of the group that hurried to aid. After Andranik Zohrabyan bled to death, Abajyan continued to fight alone from the cell against a large number of enemy forces. After spotting the approaching Azeri soldiers, he attracted their attention by raising his hands and pretended to surrender, while secretly keeping an exposed hand grenade. Allowing 2 Azeri soldiers to approach, Abajyan blew himself up with a grenade committing suicide. It's not clear if he could kill or wound any enemy soldier with his action. Having made that decision, he radioed in and said, as a last request, \\"Under no circumstances are you to abandon this position!\\" On 8 April, after a mutual agreement was reached in advance between both parties, bodies of Abajyan and Zohrabyan were found as a result of body searching operations.  Funeral  On 11 April 2016, Abajyan was buried in the Yerablur Military Pantheon. Funeral ceremonies were held in front of St. John the Baptist Church in Yerevan.

It is the third game in the Genkai Tokki series, following Monster Monpiece and Moe Chronicle, and preceding Genkai Tokki: Seven Pirates. Like the other games, Moero Crystal places emphasis on ecchi and fanservice content, and follows protagonist and \\"lucky lecher\\" Zenox as he searches for monster girl bras in order to \\"save the world\\". The game was released on September 25, 2015 in Japan and in greater Asia with Chinese subtitles in 2016. The game was released on September 5, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch in Japan and worldwide in September 2020.https://ec.nintendo.com/JP/ja/titles/70010000021641  Gameplay  Moero Crystal is the direct sequel to 2014's Moe Chronicle, and contains the same fanservice-focused gameplay as its predecessor. Whereas in Chronicle players were on a journey searching for panties, in Crystal, they search for bras. Crystal also expands on the previous gameplay, with its \\"build up, release, and insert\\" battle system featuring a new \\"Insert\\" command, allowing players to change the characters' attacking order. During battles, the player will also get to help the monster girls by providing them with buffs as support. This is as the protagonist, Zenox, cannot attack and can only utilize support abilities. A team of five monster girls is required for battle. Buffs and bonuses can be utilized and the girls' costumes degrade over time. Upon defeating a monster girl, players can recruit them through the game's touchscreen \\"scratching\\" feature; a new \\"Double Scratch\\" mode allows players to \\"massage\\" and interact with up to two monster girls at a time. 50 monster girls from the previous game reappear, as well as 30 additional new ones. Crystal also features different endings specific to different monster girls, with each of the 80 girls having a separate ending. Upon meeting certain prerequisites, it is possible to go inside the heart of a specific monster girl in a dungeon called the \\"Depths Domain\\"; clearing it unlocks a variety of different things for the said character. Unlike Moero Chronicle, where character costumes of bras and panties came in a set, Crystal allows players to mix and match thus creating different costume combinations. Additionally, players can visit monster girls to gift them presents, as well as visit the in-game inn. The game's story begins when the \\"Bra of Everlasting Darkness\\" and \\"Panties of Hope\\" are stolen, and a \\"Dimensional Chasm\\" appears in the skies. The world starts rising and pulls itself towards the rift. The protagonist is a \\"lucky lecher\\" named Zenox; Otton, a panty hunter and mascot of the series reappears from the previous games, and the game follows the characters as they search and gather monster girl bras in order to \\"save the world\\". = Characters = Main characters: * (voiced by Yusuke Shirai), the protagonist of Moero Crystal, is nicknamed the \\"walking lucky pervert\\" and often finds himself in strange and unexpected situations with members of the opposite sex. Siliconera compared him to To Love-Rus Rito, except he is \\"actually capable of fighting.\\" * (voiced by Reina Ueda), the guardian of the great shrine that contained the \\"Bra of Perpetual Darkness\\". She is known to be oftentimes interested in the relationships between men and women. * (voiced by Asuka Nishi), a shrine maiden.

He was killed in mid career when an upper floor collapsed at the local hotel where he was attending a furniture auction. Life =Provenance and early years= Ernest de Regge was born in Overmere, a small village in the intensively settled countryside between Ghent and Antwerp. His father, Karel De Regge, who was the sacristan- organist at the local church, supported himself as a teacher. The child's musical talent was identified while he was still at primary school, when he and his brother received organ lessons from Jules De Groote, brother to Emile De Groote, the organist at Ghent. Later de Regge received private organ lessons from Emile De Groote himself. In the meantime, he received a conventional secondary schooling in Sint-Niklaas. He then attended the Lemmens Institute in Mechelen, which involved a daily 5 mile (8 km) commute by bicycle to the station at Dendermonde before completing the journey on the train. At the Institute he studied composition, organ and, importantly, Gregorian plainsong, emerging in 1922 with a degree. His marks in the final exams were second only to those of his contemporary Flor Peeters, who also won the organ prize that year. Ernest De Regge won the prize for composition, however. =Postwar emigration= Great Britain had entered the First World War ostensibly in order to defend the territorial integrity of Belgium, and across the British isles there had been much sympathy for the Belgian refugees who had arrived between 1914 and 1918. During a period of elevated nationalism across Europe, in the emerging Irish Free State there was also a sense of fellow feeling with Belgium as a victim of a militarily powerful and intrusive neighbour. For a newly qualified professional musician, Ireland shone out as a country with an abundance of well-maintained church and cathedral organs and a shortage of professional musicians, where a Belgian might expect a warm welcome. Accordingly, following his graduation at Mechelen, Ernest de Regge emigrated to Ennis in County Clare. His prospects were enhanced by the excellent reputation of the Lemmens Institute internationally. The bishop gave him a job as a music teacher at St. Flannan's College, a prestigious school with close connections to the seminary. Bishop Michael Fogarty, who according to one source \\"ruled the diocese of Killaloe from 1904 until his death ... in 1955\\", would play an important role in de Regge's career and life more generally. With effect from 1923 de Regge was appointed organist and choir master at the cathedral. His appointment should be seen in the context of Bishop Fogarty's determination, in compliance with the 1903 papal initiative \\"Tra le sollecitudini\\", to restore the primacy of Gregorian chant in worship. During the 1920s and 1930s De Regge made frequent returns to Belgium, and he took the opportunity to receive further private tuition in harmony and orchestration with Paul Gilson and Lodewijk Mortelmans. It may be that Gilson provided advice on the piano concerto that De Regge was working on, but Gilson died in 1942 and the work was never completed. =Reputational achievements= The Ennis cathedral choir had originally been set up in 1859 by another Belgian, Charles Louis Nono. Under De Regge the choir's profile and reputation flourished. At a time when there was only one radio station in the country, the Ennis choir under Ernest de Regge featured in nationally broadcast concerts or masses in 1930, 1933, 1935, 1946, 1947 en 1953. According to one source the first Holy Mass to be broadcast by Raidi√≥ √âireann, transmitted on the Feast of the Epiphany as late as 1940, came from Ennis Cathedral. The same source quotes an (unidentified) press review: \\"...the brilliant success achieved is a tribute to the excellent training provided to the cathedral choir by organist E De Regge\\". =The author= In connection with his teaching work, De Regge produced a text book entitled \\"Theory of Music\\" which was used in many Irish and English schools. He also published a book entitled \\"Uraiceacht Ceoil\\" (\\"Rudiments of Music\\", 1953), though it is not immediately clear whether this was the same book in a different language or a different book. =The composer= Ernest De Regge's most enduring contribution was as a composer. He wrote roughly 300 works, mostly for the organ, piano, chamber ensemble or for mixed choirs. There were songs based on English and Gaelic texts and several settings of the Mass. With the political establishment of the recently launched Irish Free State keen to build national identity, De Regge received commissions from the Ministry of Education and Culture for nationalist-romantic compositions. He spent a number of years adapting old folk songs, complete with Gaelic language commentaries, for use in schools, a project on which he worked in collaboration with the schools inspector and musician M√≠che√°l √ì Siochfhradha, Sister Mary Albeus and fellow teacher Joseph Rogers (not to be confused with Bishop Joseph Rodgers). He also received a commission from the Irish National Army to compose them a \\"Corps Song\\". Many of his best compositions and arrangements have been taken up by \\"Nan Mulligan's Choir\\" and broadcast on national radio. Enniscorthy Choral Society and Valda Choir, conducted by Donagh Wylde, have also made recordings of his music. One high point came in 1950 when De Regge's \\"Ave Maria\\" was performed in Rome by the Vatican choir for the Marian Year in 1950. As the reputation of his compositions grew they featured and won prizes at various music festivals and competitions. =Money= De Regge was appointed to his college and cathedral posts in 1923 for an annual salary of ¬£300. He was still on the same salary in the 1950s which was one of several causes of tension with the bishop. He will have received some additional amounts for giving private music lessons, and in connection with his composition, but his eldest daughter later recalled growing up in a family that was usually short of money. De Regge supplemented his income with various entrepreneurial activities. At different stages he tried chicken breeding, importing cars, managing a jewellery shop in Ennis or a music shop in Limerick. He also traded in antiques, including old pianos which he acquired with the intention of restoring them and selling them on at a profit. =Death at Carmody‚Äôs Hotel= Carmody‚Äôs Hotel in Ennis had a formidable history. It was said that it was here that Charles Stewart Parnell had met Kitty O'Shea for the first time. During the twentieth century Taoiseach de Valera had appeared on the balcony to greet crowds of supporters. But by 1958, with its best days behind it, the time had come to sell off the contents of Carmody's Hotel. An auction lasting for three days was scheduled to take place in the Sarsfield Room on the hotel's second floor (first floor according to British English usage), starting on Wednesday 15 January 1958. It was not an opportunity to miss and Ernest de Regge was one of many who attended the auction hoping for bargains. At 14.35 on the first day of the auction, after the auctioneer had announced the next lot - the hotel linen - but before anyone had the chance to make a bid for it, the floor collapsed, and those who had been in the Sarsfield Room were dropped down fourteen feet into the Commercial Room below it. Emergency services were quickly on the scene, which a contemporary report described as \\"a seething mass of humanity and debris\\". Ernest De Regge was one of the eight or nine people killed. =Funeral= His funeral mass was a grand event at Ennis Cathedral. Despite sometimes frosty relations between De Regge and the bishop, proceedings were conducted by Bishop Joseph Rodgers, the former co-adjutor bishop who had taken charge after the death of Michael Fogarty in October 1955. Among those in the congregation was the Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera. After the mass, the residual solemnity of the occasion faced a challenged when the hearse carrying the coffin from the cathedral to the grave yard on the edge of town broke down and could not be persuaded to start. While larger mourners attempted a \\"push start\\" (and failed), the rumour began to spread among mourners at the back of the large procession that the hold-up was somehow linked to the propensity of De Regge's own ancient car to \\"need a push\\" at inopportune moments: there was talk of some sort of practical joke in exceptionally poor taste. In the end several of the more robust choir members extracted the coffin from the hearse and Ernest De Regge's poor body completed the final few hundred meters to the burial ground at Drumcliff not in the smooth comfort of an ancient hearse but on the shoulders of his choir. The family stayed in Ennis for long enough to enable the children to complete their school exams for the year, but by the end of 1958 they had relocated to Belgium. Personal It was only on 25 August 1939, during his 37th year, that Ernest de Regge married. His bride was H√©l√®ne Coppieters whom he had got to know in the course of his trips back to Belgium. H√©l√®ne's family had close connections with the church, and the marriage ceremony was conducted by her uncle, who was the Bishop of Ghent. There was also a celebrity organist in the person of the bridegroom's friend from their student days, Flor Peeters. The marriage was a happy one and resulted in six recorded children. Bishop Fogarty moved to a new palace around this time and Ernest De Regge was able to live for some years with his bride and rapidly growing family at the bishop's old house. The underlying financial arrangements are not clear, but in 1948 the De Regge family were evicted by the bishop, who served the notice document personally, accompanied by his newly appointed co-adjutor bishop, Dr Joseph Rodgers. The family spent several months living in an hotel, and then a small apartment, before finding a more permanent home at 7 Bindon Street. Many years later, De Regge's eldest daughter recalled that the incident had left her parents disillusioned and confused. They had considered moving back to Belgium, but in the end the family remained in Ennis, with Ernest employed by Bishop Fogarty till the old bishop died in October 1955. In her autobiographical memoir of her childhood in Ennis, Ghislaine de Regge provides a carefully calibrated evaluation of Bishop Fogarty: \\"His tender side the bishop showed to his elegant Irish Wolf Hounds\\".

Biography =Early life= Wetzer was born on 7 August 1868 in Pfronten in the Kingdom of Bavaria, the son of Martin Wetzer, an engineer for the Finnish Pilot Board. in the Grand Duchy of Finland, then a part of the Russian Empire, he attended Hamina Cadet School from 1882 to 1889. Wetzer had a brother, Konni Wetzer (1871‚Äì1940), who became a noted theater director. =Early career= Upon graduation in 1889, Wetzer was commissioned as an ensign. He served as an officer in the Finnish Guards' Rifle Battalion from 1889 to 1906 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1893, to staff captain in 1897 and to captain in 1901.Mikko Uola, \\"Wetzer, Martin (1868 - 1954),\\" Kansallisbiografia, 30 July 2007. He also graduated from the University of Helsinki as a gymnastics teacher in 1898. The Finnish Guard was ordered disbanded in 1905, beginning a lengthy process which lasted into 1906, and after he finally mustered out of it in 1906 he received a post-service termination salary for his time in the battalion. After leaving the battalion, Wetzer began to study law at the University of Helsinki, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1910. He became a lawyer, a position he held until 1914, and was a partner in the law firm Wetzer & Wahlberg in Vyborg from 1910 to 1917. He became a deputy judge in 1913. =World War I= When World War I broke out in 1914, Wetzer returned to active military service in the Imperial Russian Army. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel at the beginning of the war and served as a battalion commander in Galicia, the Carpathian Mountains, Lithuania, and Byelorussia during the first two years of the war. He was promoted to colonel in 1915 and commanded an infantry division in Bukovina from 1916 to 1917. After the Russian Revolution began in 1917, Wetzer resigned from the army and returned to Finland. =Finnish Civil War= In Finland, Wetzer joined the Military Committee, which sought the Independence of Finland. Immediately at the beginning of the Finnish Civil War in late January 1918, Wetzer became an important figure in the organization of the White Army of Finland, as he was a close friend of General Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, who had been appointed commander-in-chief. When forming his staff in January 1918, Mannerheim appointed Wetzer as the first chief of staff. On 27 January 1918, the first day of the war, Wetzer was also allowed to lead the disarmament of the Russians in the central city of Vaasa, which had the largest Russian Army garrison in South Ostrobothnia. As early as 5 February 1918, Wetzer was transferred to the H√§me Group as commander and he took over the central Vilppula front, where the Red Guards repeatedly attacked to take over the strategically important railway crossing at Haapam√§ki. The H√§me Group repulsed the Reds' attacks in Vilppula, but was unable to begin progress towards Tampere as planned until the J√§ms√§ Group, commanded by Colonel Karl Wilkman, struck the Reds in Orivesi and forced them to retreat. However, the H√§me Group, commanded by Wetzer, played a key role in the conquest of Tampere at the beginning of April At the decisive stage, at the turn of March‚ÄìApril 1918, all troops attacking the center of Tampere from the east and south were under Wetzer's command. He was promoted to major general after the conquest of Tampere. When the White War leadership was reorganized, on 7 April 1918, Wetzer became the commander of the Western Army, and he was responsible for the battles along the Lemp√§√§l√§‚ÄìTuulos‚ÄìLammi‚ÄìH√§meenlinna in the last weeks of the war. The war ended in a White victory in on 15 May 1918, and he resigned from permanent military service in June 1918. =Estonian War of Independence= In January 1919, Wetzer joined the Estonian Army as a volunteer and served as the commander of all Finnish volunteer forces in Estonia for three months. He then came into severe conflict with Estonian Colonel Hans Kalm, who commanded the Northern Sons Regiment. Estonians did not trust Wetzer because he was seen as a defender of the Baltic German nobility and the interests of the Russian White movement, which sought support from Estonia for Mannerheim's plan for an attack on Petrograd as part of the Russian Civil War. By taking advantage of the anti-German sentiment of the Estonians, Kalm brought about the de facto expulsion of Wetzer, described publicly as a trip to the homeland because of health issues. =Later life= After returning to Finland, Wetzer served as the commander of the Finnish Army's 3rd Division from 1919 to 1920 and as commander of the 2nd Division from 1921 to 1925. Occasionally he was employed by the law firm of Antell & S√∂derhjelm for a year at a time. He was also the chairman of the Finnish delegation to ceasefire negotiations between Finland and Soviet Russia in 1920 and a member of the Hornborg Committee defense audit of 1923 to 1926. As demands for the resignation of old tsarist officers increased in the mid-1920s, Wetzer resigned from the military in 1925 and received upon his resignation.a promotion to the rank of lieutenant general. In retirement, he was promoted to the rank of general of the infantry in 1928. After his military career, Wetzer worked in the Helsinki Court of Appeal as a notary in 1926 and as a legal adviser from 1927 to 1938. After retiring from government service, he worked for the Industrial Mutual Fire Insurance Company from 1938 to 1945. During the Winter War of 1939‚Äì1940 and the Continuation War of 1941‚Äì1944, Wetzer held a special position as \\"commander-in-chief,\\" which mainly involved the distribution of medals to wounded soldiers in military hospitals. He died in Helsinki on 29 September 1954.

Most Corynebacterium are harmless but some cause serious illness in humans, especially in immunocompromised humans. C. ulcerans has been known to cause diphtheria and diphtheria-like infections in patients. Previously thought to simply be contaminants recovered from diphtheria patients, ‚Äúcoryneform‚Äù or ‚Äúdiphtheroids‚Äù are now believed to be the cause of such infections. Disease Increasingly over the past few decades, C. ulcerans has been recognized as an emerging pathogen in over six countries across the globe including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. C. diphtheriae is the causative agent of classical diphtheria, and C. ulcerans has been found to carry the same gene that codes for the diphtheria toxin. After swabbing lesions on a 53-year-old woman in Germany who experienced swelling of her pharynx and who developed a whitish pseudomembrane, doctors were able to grow C. ulcerans. This made it the first documented case of classical diphtheria caused by C. ulcerans in Germany. C. ulcerans can also cause zoonotic infections. In 2003, A 47-year-old woman in Le Kremlin-Bic√™tre, France was admitted to the intensive care unit for labored breathing. It was found that as a result of a kidney graft received the previous year, the patient was immunocompromised and vulnerable to C. ulcerans, which was found growing from a swab of her throat. After many tests, it was concluded that the patient had contracted the disease from her dog, which was found to have chronic labial ulcerations that provided an easy way to transmit the bacteria to the patient. In addition to classical diphtheria, C. ulcerans can also cause skin infections that resemble classical cutaneous diphtheria as a result of production of the diphtheria toxin. By contracting this skin infection, patients become more vulnerable to contracting other bacteria that exist naturally in the patient's environment that can cause life-threatening diseases. Treatment Patients who contract diphtheria and diphtheria-like symptoms as a result of C. ulcerans require treatment with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics. Surgery and other more extreme measures must be taken if not treated immediately.

Life He was born at Forest Hill, London, one of the four sons of Charles Fitch Kemp (died 1907), a leading chartered accountant. Two of his brothers, Charles and Arthur, also played first-class cricket for Kent, and Charles played for Oxford University too. The youngest son, Harold Fitch Kemp, played for the Harrow School XI, as did all the brothers. He followed his father in becoming President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Kemp, Manley Colchester At Harrow School, Kemp was captain of the cricket team and also won the public schools rackets championship in both 1879 and 1880. At Oxford University, he matriculated in 1880 and was a scholar at Hertford College. Kemp won Blues at Oxford for rackets and for soccer as well as playing for the Oxford cricket team in the University Match in each of his four seasons at the university. He then became a schoolmaster at Winchester College for three years from 1885, before returning to Harrow as a master, where he remained involved with school sports, particularly cricket, up to the end of his life, though he retired from teaching in 1921. Cricketer Kemp had already appeared in first-class cricket before he went to Oxford, being picked for a \\"Gentlemen of the South\\" side in 1879 and for Kent and a Gentlemen of Kent team in 1880. He was a right-handed batsman who usually played in the middle order and a wicketkeeper, though he did not always keep wicket when he played for Kent. As a batsman, Kemp's figures appear unimpressive to modern eyes, but he produced occasional innings of brilliance. As captain of the Oxford University team in both 1883 and 1884, he led the 1884 side to an unexpected victory over the full Australian touring team, making an unbeaten 63 out of an unbroken fourth- wicket partnership of 76. After leaving Oxford University, his first-class cricket was confined largely to the August school holidays, though he played almost a whole season in 1886; in that year, he made his highest score and only century, an innings of 175 for the Gentlemen of England cricket team against Cambridge University, made out of a total of 298 after the first six wickets had been lost for just 21 runs. He played in the Gentlemen v Players matches from 1883 to 1885. He did not appear in first-class cricket after 1895. Death Kemp died at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on 30 June 1951.

Although infected people suffer with fever- like symptoms, some people in Uzbekistan have reported with severe disease such as encephalitis and other large outbreaks of fever illness connected infection with the virus. The transmission cycle of members of the M-TBFV complex involves ixodid ticks and rodents. Not enough information about the development of the virus in rodent hosts is available, so many researchers have had to infect mice by needle or by allowing an infected tick to feed on them. Ticks exposed to Royal Farm virus remained efficient carriers even when tested about 8 years after their initial exposure. Because of this insight, these ticks may serve as a long-term maintenance mechanism for Royal Farm virus Earlier studies suggest that the infection of a two-day-old white experimental mice with the virus results in deaths occurring 8‚Äì12 days after infection. Nine-day-old mice rarely die with similar exposure. Classification More than 38 viral species are transmitted by ticks. Virus- to-tick host relationships are very specific and less than 10% of all tick species (Argasidae and Ixodidae) are known to be carriers of arboviruses. Tick-borne viruses are found in six different virus families (Asfarviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae). Tick-borne flaviviruses are among the most important viruses in the world, primarily Europe and Asia. Tick-borne encephalitis causes between 10,000 and 15,000 human cases every year in Europe and Asia. Most of these viruses are needed for veterinary medicine. Several other tick-borne flaviviruses have not been known to cause human nor animal diseases, and their potential pathogenicity for humans and animals is unknown/unavailable. Alterations in human behavior, land use, or climate may change the actual geographical distribution and transmission intensity so that tick-borne flaviviruses are potentially relevant of the environment and may increase in medical importance. Historic findings Isolation of this virus was tested via electron microscopy and testing on mice. Royal Farm virus has a one-way antigenic relationship with West Nile virus. A similar relationship with West Nile virus has been shown in Usutu virus isolated from Coquillettidia aurites in Uganda. However, this is a reverse type of relationship as compared with that between Royal Farm and West Nile viruses. It cannot be excluded that Royal Farm virus appeared due to antigenic drift in a genetically isolated population of West Nile virus. Replication Certain species of mosquitoes and ticks were examined for their likelihood of transmitting Royal Farm and Langat (tick-borne encephalitis virus complex) viruses in the laboratory. It was found that there is no proof of replication of Karshi virus in the mosquito species that were tested, however, Karshi virus replication was seen in three species of Ornithodoros ticks tested. When injected with Royal Farm virus, 90% of Ornithodoros ticks (44/49) transmitted this virus by bite to suckling mice, and transmission continued to occur for at least 1 year References Category:Flaviviruses ","title":"Royal Farm virus"},{"id":"50529613","text":"This is a photo from Joe Louise Puppet's show in Thailand.

Description Phallusia mammillata is a solitary species of ascidian and can grow to a height of about . The tunic is a translucent, bluish-white colour and is covered with irregular rounded lobes or mounds. Distribution This tunicate is found on rocky, sandy or muddy substrates in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea to depths of about . Biology Like all tunicates, Phallusia mammillata has a thick leathery tunic containing a cellulosic material. The tunic encloses a sac- shaped cavity with separate siphons through which water is drawn in and expelled. The animal feeds on the planktonic particles that it filters from the incoming seawater by passing it through a mucous net. P. mammillata is one of a small number of ascidians that accumulate the element vanadium in their blood cells. It is unclear why the tunicate should do this, but concentrations of up to 350 mM have been found, some ten million times higher than in the surrounding seawater. The ascidian has at least ten different types of blood cell, and the vanadium-accumulating cells have been shown to be \\"vacuolated and granular amoebocytes, signet ring cells and type-II compartment cells\\". Each P. mammillata individual is a hermaphrodite. Eggs are released through the exhalent siphon and external fertilization in the water column takes place. The eggs hatch into free-swimming, tadpole-like larvae, which within a few days settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles.

Anna Boberg, Northern Lights, oil on canvas, n.d. Anna Katarina Boberg, n√©e Scholander, (3 December 1864 ‚Äì 27 January 1935) was a Swedish artist married to prominent architect Ferdinand Boberg. Anna Scholander was the daughter of architect Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander and the granddaughter of Axel Nystr√∂m. Boberg was a person of many artistic pursuits; initially she worked with ceramics and textiles (among other things she created \\"the Peacock vase\\" for R√∂rstrand) and besides painting she also worked with set design and writing, for example. She was of an artistic family, but never received any formal training in the arts, and is considered an autodidact. Many of her paintings are of northern Norway, which became Boberg's main focus for many years after a trip there in 1901. These works were not received very well in Sweden, but did much better in Paris. Boberg spent a great deal of time in the area near Lofoten in Norway, where she eventually had a cabin, and she made many of those trips on her own.  Life and work  Boberg was the sixth of seven children in the Scholander family. She studied French, and was briefly enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris to study painting. Paris is also where she met future architect Ferdinand Boberg, who was there on a study trip. They were engaged in 1884. Ferdinand Boberg was at the time far from having his finances in order, but Boberg persuaded her mother Carin, n√©e Nystr√∂m, to allow them to marry anyway; her father had died in 1881. Boberg lacked formal training but began painting already in 1882 during a trip to Spain with her mother and some of her siblings. Her father had found a profitable sideline in painting and drawing. The Bobergs married in 1888, initially staying with the Scholanders, until their improved economy allowed them to move into their own flat at Tegn√©rgatan 13 in Stockholm. In 1896 the couple had their summer house Villa Ugglebo built in Norra Djurg√•rden in Stockholm. In 1887, Boberg began painting in earnest, mainly using watercolour, and she had her first exhibition in 1888. During the 1890s she also painted 'tapestries,' oil paintings on rough canvas reminiscent of woven tapestries. These 'tapestries' were displayed as wall decorations in, among other places, H√¥tel Rydberg (which was later demolished, and the tapestries were transferred to √Örsta Castle). She also created wall decorations for the Wallenberg Grand Hotel Saltsj√∂baden. Boberg exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Around the turn of the century 1800‚Äì1900 Boberg also worked with applied arts. She designed the Peacock Vase (P√•f√•gelvasen) for R√∂rstrand in 1897 and glass for Reijmyre glassworks, as well as textile works. At the World Fair in Paris in 1900, where Ferdinand Boberg was the architect for the Swedish pavilion, Boberg created numerous textiles, which were woven by the Friends of Handicraft association (Handarbetets v√§nner) and the K.A. Almgren silk factory. She was also the writer and set designer for Wilhelm Stenhammar's opera Tirfing, performed in 1898. During a trip to northern Sweden and Norway with her husband in 1901, Boberg was mesmerized by the grandiose scenery and nature of northern Norway, Lofoten in particular. During the following 33 years she painted mainly the landscapes and people of Lofoten, often in wintertime. In 1904, her husband drew a small house for her, which was built on the Fyr√∂n island by Svolv√¶r, where Boberg could stay during her many trips to Lofoten. She most often took these trips alone. In 1903, Boberg showed her Lofoten paintings in Stockholm for the first time and the reactions were mixed. An exhibition in Paris in 1905 brought greater success and overwhelmingly positive feedback, laying the foundation for a prolific career in France. The last exhibition took place in 1927.  After 1915  When Ferdinand Boberg withdrew from his career as an architect in 1915, Boberg joined him on the many extensive journeys he made through Sweden for the \\"Swedish images\\" project. The trips were initially made in a Scania Vabis bus with a driver. Ferdinand Boberg sketched buildings of significance to the cultural heritage, to document areas he thought would disappear within a not too distant future. Boberg made diary notes along the way, the result of which was later published. In 1925, the Bobergs were forced to sell on S√∂dra Djurg√•rden, designed by Ferdinand, where they had lived since 1903. After this, they moved to Paris. In march of 1929, the couple returned to Stockholm, residing in Villa Blecktornet on S√∂dermalm until Boberg's death from gall bladder surgery complications in 1935.

The original paintings were destroyed by fire in 1793. History The Cowdray engravings are based on five paintings produced for Sir Anthony Browne, King Henry VIII's Master of the Horse. They were probably produced between 1545 and 1548 and were painted onto the walls of Browne's hall in Cowdray House.; They showed key scenes in his life and might have been used by him when recounting stories during formal events. The painting included The Departure of King Henry VIII from Calais, The Encampment of King Henry VIII at Marquison, The Siege of Boulogne by King Henry VIII, The Encampment of the English forces near Portsmouth and The riding of King Edward VI from the Tower of London to Westminster. Philip Yorke, the Earl of Hardwick and a keen antiquarian, proposed producing engravings of the paintings in the 1760s. His colleague, the antiquarian Sir Joseph Ayloffe, was spurred on by his interest and convinced the Society of Antiquaries to record them as engravings, as part of a longer series of historical prints produced by the society.; ; The Encampment of the English Forces near Portsmouth was rendered as a watercolour by John and Charles Sherwin and then engraved by James Basire. Samuel Hieronymous Grimm copied the remaining four paintings which Basire then engraved. The engravings were published in 1788 with a print run of 400 copies, distributed to fellow of the society and sold to the public.; Cowdray House burnt down on 24 September 1793 and the paintings were mostly destroyed as the rendering came away from the walls, although some fragments may have survived for a few years after the fire.

She discusses eight types of participation in A Ladder of Citizen Participation (1969). Often termed as \\"Arnstein's ladder\\", these are broadly categorized as: 1\\\\. Citizen Power: Citizen Control, Delegated Power, Partnership. 2\\\\. Tokenism: Placation, Consultation, Informing. 3\\\\. Non-participation: Therapy, Manipulation. She defines citizen participation as the redistribution of power that enables the have-not citizens, presently excluded from the political and economic processes, to be deliberately included in the future. Sherry Phyllis Arnstein, (n√©e Rubin) (11 January 1930 ‚Äì 19 January 1997) was the author of the highly influential journal article \\"Ladder of Citizen Participation\\". Working as a special assistant to the assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Housing, Education, and Welfare (HUD), she developed the insights that led to the development of her seminal paper in the field of participatory decision making. In 1969, she wrote and published several papers that deal with public participation in decision making. Among them, \\"A Ladder of Citizen Participation\\" (1969), \\"Maximum Feasible Manipulation\\" (1972) and \\"A Working Model for Public Participation\\" (1975). Her first paper, in which she suggested different levels of public participation has a lasting impact in many areas of research, including geography, urban planning, public policy, health policy, and sociology, to name a few. Sherry Rubin was born in New York City to Bernard Rubin (born Russia) and Lucille Goldstein (born France). At a young age, her family moved to California. She studied physical education at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and after graduation worked as a caseworker in Alameda County Juvenile Court. In 1955, she moved to Washington, DC. and received a Masters in communications from American University. After her work at HUD, she was a consulting public policy analyst at Arthur D. Little, a senior research fellow at the National Center for Health Services Research, and vice president of the National Health Council. She served 10 years as executive director of the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) between 1985 and 1995.

Career  Built for the Crown, Saint Michel was originally manned by officers of the French East India Company. During the War of the Austrian Succession, Saint Michel was part of a squadron under Admiral de Rochambeau; on 17 August 1744, she captured the 20-gun near Gibraltar. In 1747, her command was transferred to Navy officers. In 1761, she was recommissioned in Rochefort under Captain de Lizardais to serve in the Seven Years' War, to served in the Caribbean theatre, but she never actually departed. She was then refitted as a 60 gun ship in 1762. During the American Revolutionary War, Saint Michel took part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778, under Mithon de Genouilly. She and later took part in the capture of HMS Ardent off Plymouth on 17 August 1779. She took part in the Battle of Martinique in the Caribbean on 17 April 1780, under Chevalier d'Aymar. On 11 December 1781, Bussy-Castelnau departed Cadiz with a squadron comprising Saint-Michel and the 74-gun Illustre, escorting three transports, to make his junction at Tenerife with another squadron under Guichen. the next day, they encountered a British squadron under Kempenfelt. In the subsequent Second Battle of Ushant, most of the French transports were captured by the British, except Marquis de Castries and Neptune-Royal, which reached Sainte-Croix carrying siege artillery and an artillery company. Bussy sailed on towards the Indian Ocean, arriving to Table Bay in early April. He landed his troops to reinforce the Dutch Cape Colony against a possible British attack, and on 2 May he sailed to Isle de France (Mauritius), where Saint-Michel and Illustre arrived on 31, the transports following a few days later. Informed that Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves had left the island on 7 December 1781 with his squadron to attack Trincomalee, Bussy decided to attach the 40-gun frigate Consolante to his squadron, as well as 800 men from the garrison which he embarked on 9 transports, and go reinforce him. On 21 August 1782, Ilustre and Saint-Michel arrived at Batacalo, making their junction with the squadron under Suffren. They were escorting 8 transports and preceded by the corvette Fortune, under Lusignan. Appointed to Suffren's squadron in the Indian Ocean, she took part in the battles of Trincomalee. After D'Aymar was promoted to Annibal, Suffren appointed Lieutenant Beaumont le Ma√Ætre to replace him. Saint Michel took part in the Cuddalore, before she returned to France in 1784. Saint Michel carried out another mission to the Indian Ocean in 1787 before returning to France to be hulked the next year.

The website is curated by the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and promoted by Advisor to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine . In October 2015 he proposed to add a special section titled \\"Putin's crimes in Syria and Middle East\\" dedicated for personal data of Russian military personnel of the operation in Syria collected by Inform Napalm, which he believed could help \\"ISIS and their brethren in Russia, of whom there are many in the Caucasus\\" to take revenge on them \\"in accordance with Sharia law\\".https://www.facebook.com/anton.gerashchenko.7/posts/928575253895989 Another controversy occurred in April 2015 when the website published the home addresses of Ukrainian writer Oles Buzina and former Verkhovna Rada parliamentarian Oleg Kalashnikov just days before they were assassinated. On 7 May 2016 the website published the personal data of 4,508 journalists and other media members from all over the world who had worked (or had received accreditation to work) on the war in the uncontrolled government territory of Donbass, and therefore were considered by the site to have cooperated with terrorists. There were phone numbers, email addresses, and some countries and cities of residence of Ukrainian and foreign journalists received from the hacked database of Donetsk People's Republic Ministry of State Security; journalists and support staff provided these data to be accredited by the unrecognized Donetsk People's Republic. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine issued a statement that it found no violations of Ukrainian law by Myrotvorets. The slogan of the centre's website and the centre itself is a Latin saying: Pro bono publico (for the public good). History The staff of the \\"Myrotvorets\\" Centre Myrotvorets Centre began to develop the project in summer 2014, during the War in Donbass. The project was launched in December 2014 as part of the work of the volunteer group known as \\"Narodny Tyl\\". The first true leader and participants were not reported, for their safety. For distraction a leader was presented as \\"Narodny Tyl\\" leader Ukrainian politician and activist Georgy Tuka, who since 29 April 2016 serves in the Ukrainian government as Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs and before that, in 2015‚Äì2016, served as the governor of Luhansk Oblast (\\"chairman of the Luhansk Regional Military and Civil Administration\\") appointed by president Petro Poroshenko. The director of the Centre is Roman Zaitsev, a former employee of the territorial office of the SBU in the Luhansk region. At the Centre, there are about 250 people living both in Ukraine and abroad. During the first two years the Centre incurred losses in killed, wounded and missing people. The website is promoted by Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. The centre is affiliated with the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Activity Coat of \\"Myrotvorets\\" staff member with field version of emblem The \\"Myrotvorets\\" leader states that the centre's objective is to provide information and advice to the executive authorities, to finally bring peace and harmony in Ukraine. In its work the centre pays special attention to expressions of \\"separatist and terrorist activities\\" on the territory of Ukraine. Sources of information for the centre are primarily public materials posted on the Internet, publications and more. Much like other volunteer organisations, the centre widely uses OSINT methods. In addition, the centre uses information provided by individuals on a confidential basis. Under current Ukrainian law, the centre does not use information contained in anonymous appeals. In October 2015, the centre added a special section titled \\"Putin's crimes in Syria and the Middle East\\" dedicated to providing personal data of Russian military personnel involved in the operation in Syria, according to Russian media \\"to help ISIS take revenge\\" on the Russian pilots \\"in accordance with Sharia law\\". Myrotvorets' actions caused extremely strong reactions from the Russian presidential administration and among Russian experts in military affairs and special operations. As stated in the website InformNapalm, an important element of the operation was to compare the numbers of Su-24 from the Russian airbase \\"Shagol\\" and the same type of aircraft, overturned in Syria. A few days after the operation began, Russian TV started to hide the numbers of military aircraft based in Syria for their video shoots. After the information was published, the Investigative Committee of Russia launched criminal proceedings against Anton Gerashchenko for \\"public calls to terrorism.\\" In February 2016, members of the centre took part in the operation of mobile groups against illegal transport of cargo through the line of armed conflict in the War in Donbass. Myrotvorets Centre repeatedly provided information on the participation of foreign nationals in the armed conflict, on the side of pro-Russian separatists. In early March 2016, due to the materials published by the centre, law enforcement authorities in Bulgaria initiated criminal proceedings against George Bliznakov, a Bulgarian citizen. Similar materials are being considered regarding other Bulgarian citizens. According to the head of the centre, 4.5 thousand people were in the file cabinet in October 2014; 16 December 2015 ‚Äì 7.5 thousand; January 2015 ‚Äì 9000; 13 April 2015 ‚Äì 30 thousand. In October 2015 ‚Äì 45 thousand people; by 21 March 2016 ‚Äì 57,775 people; by 27 January 2017 - more than 102 thousand, on the 23rd of August 2019 - 187 thousand¬´–î–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ–º –≤—Å–µ—Ö, –∫—Ç–æ –ø–æ–¥–Ω—è–ª —Ä—É–∫—É –Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—É¬ª: —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä—É ¬´–ú–∏—Ä–æ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü¬ª –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏–ª–æ—Å—å 5 –ª–µ—Ç archived copy.

Western celebrities and intellectuals (such as Steven Seagal, Silvio Berlusconi, Thierry Mariani, Henry Kissinger, and Gerard Depardieu) have also found themselves landing on Myrotvorets's list, although not all have been formally banned from Ukraine.https://myrotvorets.center/criminal/sigal-stiven- frederik/https://myrotvorets.center/criminal/kissindzher-genri- alfredovichhttps://myrotvorets.center/criminal/depardyo-zherar-ksavie- marsel/https://myrotvorets.center/criminal/berluskoni- silvio/https://myrotvorets.center/criminal/mariani-terri/ Controversy In April 2015, Myrotvorets published the home addresses of Ukrainian writer Oles Buzina and former Verkhovna Rada parliamentarian Oleg Kalashnikov, just days before they were assassinated. After the site published the data of various journalists, Valeriya Lutkovska, Ukrainian lawyer and Ombudswoman of Ukraine since April 2012, demanded both the website and the Centre be shut down. Ukrainian editor and journalist Vitaly Portnikov and Ukrainian parliamentarian and military expert/blogger Dmytro Tymchuk have compared accreditation of a Ukrainian journalist in Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic to accreditation of an Israeli journalist with the Hamas \\"Ministry of Information\\" in Gaza. Among the journalists and operators registered, there is also the photojournalist Andrea Rocchelli, murdered by the Ukrainian army in 2014 while documenting the suffering of civilians during the Donbass war. In Rocchelli's file, on whose photo the Myrotvorets Center has applied the red writing superimposed \\"Liquidated\\", there is a note stating that the photojournalist was \\"cooperating with pro-Russian terrorist organizations\\" and that he had violated the border of state of Ukraine to enter the territory occupied by \\"Russian terrorist gangs\\". On 24 May 2016 Committee to Protect Journalists wrote an open letter to then Ukrainian President Poroshenko urging him to \\"condemn the unfounded and damaging allegations published on Myrotvorets, and to clarify publicly that the Ukrainian Interior Ministry is dedicated to protecting journalists and apprehending the people responsible for threatening them, in contrast to Interior Minister Avakov's previous statements\\". On 2 June 2016, G7 ambassadors to Kyiv released a joint statement expressing deep concern about disclosures of journalists' personal data on the Myrotvorets website and called on the Myrotvorets team to withdraw personal data from public access.G7 Ambassadors are deeply concerned by recent massive disclosures of journalists‚Äô personal data on the Myrotvorets website–≤ The next day President Petro Poroshenko at a press conference condemned the publication of journalists' personal data, but stressed that he is extremely limited in terms of influence over the \\"Myrotvorets\\" website. Fragment of Mr. Poroshenko's press-conference on 6 June 2016 On 22 November 2017, Russia's foreign ministry sent a note of complaint to the US Department of State to protest the migration of the site to US servers. In September 2018, Myrotvorets wrote on Facebook that their database included residents of Zakarpattia Oblast who had illegally taken out Hungarian citizenship. After two weeks of work in Zakarpattia Oblast, the database held more than 300 names of Ukrainian officials and local councillors from the oblast who had Hungarian passports. On 11 October 2018, Hungarian Foreign Minister P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ said: \\"It is a lie that the Ukrainian state has nothing to do with the website that is listing suspected dual Ukrainian-Hungarian nationals\\", and claimed that President Petro Poroshenko \\"gave his consent to the hate campaign in an attempt to increase his popularity\\".

Alternate spellings  The name has been spelled in many different forms, all of which are related to the same family including; Forristal, Forrestal, Forristal, Forestal, Forrestall, Foristal, and in medieval times, Forstall (a name still used in present-day Louisiana). Forestell is a variation found in Canada. Also, in Gaelic Irish as √ì Fuireastal (pronounced Furristhawl), Mac Fuireastal, Mac Coillte, √ì Coillte, and Mac An Choill.  History and ancestry  The Forristals were rooted in Glenmore parish, County Kilkenny, where they held several castles, some of which were located at Forristalstown, Carrickcloney and Mullenahone. Celtic high crosses near Forristalstown in Glenmore Parish, Co. Kilkenny, where the Forrestal family originates. The family is listed in the medieval records of Kilkenny, Wexford, and Waterford. They are shown aligning themselves through marriage with the Catholic nobility of Ireland through marriage alliances with the FitzGeralds, Aylwards, Cantwells, O'Bolgers, Butlers of Ormond and O'Kennedys, which through these marriages they share common ancestors and bloodlines. Many of the modern day Forrestals descend from these noble unions. The family motto, \\"In corda inimicorum regis\\", is likely taken from the Latin Vulgate's rendering of Psalm 45:5, and means \\"in the hearts of the king's enemies.\\" In modern translation, the full verse is: \\"Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king‚Äôs enemies; let the nations fall beneath your feet\\" (New International Version).https://biblehub.com/vul/psalms/45.htm  People  * James Forrestal, (1892-1949), First United States Secretary of Defense * Michael Forrestal, one of the leading aides to McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser of President John F.

He served as President of the Senate of France (1852‚Äì1869) and was a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques.Le cimeti√®re de Plombi√®res : lieu de recueillement - lieu de m√©moire - lieu d‚Äôhistoire  Life  Raymond-Theodore Troplong was born in 1795. His career started in 1819, when he became a lawyer. In 1835, he was appointed advisor of the Court of Cassation, while in 1840, he became a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences (Legislation section). He also entered the so-called Chamber of Peers in 1846, while in 1852 he became president of the Court of Cassation. Troplong co-authored the original text of the French Constitution of 1852 and he was also appointed senator on January 23, 1852. Then he became rapporteur of the s√©natus-consulte under Napoleon III (Second French Empire); Troplong legitimized Napoleon III's coup d'√©tat with this argument: He replaced the prince Jerome Bonaparte when he resigned from his position of President of the Senate of France on December 30, 1852. He retained this function for most of the Second French Empire (1852-1870) until his death in 1869. In 1858, he was appointed member of the Conseil priv√© de l'Empereur (i.e. the \\"Private Council of the Emperor\\"). Raymond-Theodore Troplong, who was one of the leading jurists of his time (he's been described as the \\"Portalis of the Second Empire\\") wrote many books about law, in which he defended a conception of law mixed with philosophy and history. He knew and discussed the work of Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the founder of the German \\"Ecole historique du droit\\", and defended neighboring but distinct positions, which seems to prove, despite what has been argued by certain authors (Julien Bonnecase, The School of Exegesis in Civil Law, 1924) his influence on the legal doctrine. In France, the existence and fecundity of a French \\"School of Law\\", whose influence is far from being marginal, is still perceived today. He was a skilled and popular writer, but he was also a very poor speaker, which earned him the sarcasm of Prosper M√©rim√©e, who once said: \\"Our President, aptly named Troplong\\" (in French, trop long means \\"too long\\"). After death, he wanted to be buried together with his only daughter Jos√©phine Marie-Louise, who had died in Plombi√®res-les-Bains in October 1839 when she was in that city with her parents for a few days of relaxation; the little girl was just eight years old. The wife of the senator and mother of the girl (1805-1881) also rests in that place. Today, the French Senate still takes care of the maintenance of the tomb. ..

She was one of the first female lecturers in agricultural science in Australia.  Life  Tully was born in Mortlake, Surrey, England, to Minnie (n√©e Merrifield) and Walter Edgar Hearman. Her family emigrated to Western Australia when she was a child, settling in Donnybrook. Her younger brother, John Hearman, later became a state MP. Tully boarded at Presbyterian Ladies' College, Perth, before going on to the University of Western Australia, where she completed a Bachelor of Science degree in 1932. She then went to study in England, receiving her doctorate in horticulture from the University of London in 1936. Upon returning to Australia, Tully joined the Forests Department of Western Australia as a research officer. However, her time there was short-lived, as in 1938 she went to Griffith, New South Wales, to work as a plant physiologist for the federal government's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Tully gave up her post with the CSIR in February 1945, having married the previous year. She was widowed later in 1945, and returned to work to help provide for her four step-children. For a short period, she was seconded to the federal Department of Agriculture, working on the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA). In 1952, Tully was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship, which she used to study at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York. She returned to Australia in 1953, and 1956 transferred to the CSIR's Melbourne station. In 1957, Tully was seconded to the Department of Psychology at the University of Melbourne, conducting research into farmers' decision making with Oscar Oeser and Fred Emery. She moved to the university's Department of Agriculture in 1959, where she completed a research project on farmers in Rochester, Victoria. In 1961, Tully took up a position as a lecturer at the University of New England, in Armidale, New South Wales. The following year, she was appointed as a senior lecturer at the University of Queensland's Department of Agriculture. Her teaching emphasised the links between agriculture and behavioural science. Tully was promoted to reader in 1971, and the following year made a fellow of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science. She died in Brisbane in 1973, of a heart attack.

Btk, along with other B. thuringiensis products, is one of the most widely used biological pesticides due to its high specificity; it is effective against lepidopterans, and it has little to no effect on nontarget species. During sporulation, Btk produces a crystal protein that is lethal to lepidopteran larvae. Once ingested by the insect, the dissolution of the crystal allows the protoxin to be released. The toxin is then activated by the insect gut juice, and it begins to break down the gut. Btk is available commercially and is commonly known as \\"Garden Dust\\" or \\"Caterpillar Killer\\", both of which are produced by Safer Brand. Other Btk- producing companies include Bonide and Monterey.  Effects on nontarget species  Btk is generally regarded as environmentally safe, as its toxicity is essentially limited to its target pest; humans, wildlife, and beneficial insects are regarded as unaffected by the pesticide. Even so, in 2012, a regulatory review of several strains of Bt by the European Food Safety Authority stated that although there was data supporting the claims of low toxicity, the data was insufficient to prove the claims conclusively. = Humans = In studies of the effects of Bt on humans, most subjects were unaffected when exposed to Bt. Some individuals reacted with irritation of the eyes and skin. Other subjects with hay fever reported more significant effects, including throat irritation, upset stomach, and difficulty sleeping. = Trichogramma wasps = Trichogramma is a species of parasitic wasp whose females lay their eggs in the eggs of their hosts; after killing the host, an adult wasp emerges. For this reason, trichogramma is often used as a biological control agent, and it can even be used in conjunction with pesticides like Bt. In November 2015, a study was conducted examining the effects of Btk on Trichogramma chilonis wasps. The study showed that high doses of strains of Btk containing Œ¥-endotoxins were acutely toxic to the wasps, while Btk without these toxins had no adverse effects. It further showed that low doses of Btk, regardless of the strain, led to significantly greater longevity in the wasps. = Soil = In a 1998 study, Btk was added to different types of soil in order to determine how the type of soil affected the persistence and concentration of Btk. The results of the study showed that insecticidal activity started to decline after only a month in one soil, while in another toxicity was still high after six months. The authors of the study noted that even though Btk is considered non-toxic to nontarget species, the accumulation and persistence of the Btk toxins could eventually lead to environmental hazards or the selection of Btk-resistant lepidopterans.

Education and career In 1897 Candido received his Laurea (teaching degree) from the University of Pisa and started to teach mathematics: first, at the Liceo of Galatina, then at the Liceo of Campobasso and from 1927 at the Liceo of Brindisi. He was an editor and contributor for the Periodico di Matematica per l'Insegnamento secondario and was one of the founders of the journal La Matematica elementare (an intermediate-level journal for teachers, engineers and students).

In 1934 he founded the Apulian branch of Mathesis, an Italian association of mathematics teachers. He is also remembered for his work on the history of mathematics. Candido's identity Candido devised his eponymous identity to prove that (F_n^2 +F_{n+1}^2 +F_{n+2}^2 )^2= 2(F_n^4 +F_{n+1}^4 +F_{n+2}^4 ) where Fn is the nth Fibonacci number. The identity of Candido is that, for all real numbers x and y, (x^2 +y^2 +(x+y)^2 )^2= 2(x^4 +y^4 +(x+y)^4 ) It is easy to prove that the identity holds in any commutative ring.

PM20D1 regulates bioactive N-acyl amide lipids and has been implicated in obesity, type 2 diabetes, pain, and Alzheimer's disease.  Function  PM20D1 catalyzes the biosynthesis of N-fatty acyl amino acids from free fatty acids and free amino acids. Consequently PM20D1 is involved in the generation of potent bioactive lipid metabolites from two abundant cellular energy precursors. PM20D1 is involved in energy homeostasis. In mice, PM20D1 is highly expressed and secreted into the blood by brown fat. Its expression in adipose tissues is increased following cold exposure. Genetic elevation of circulating PM20D1 in mice leads to accumulation of multiple circulating N-acyl amino acid species and a hypermetabolic phenotype. Conversely, PM20D1-KO exhibit bidirectional dysregulation of circulating N-acyl amino acids, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, N-fatty acyl amino acids function as UCP1-independent uncouplers of mitochondrial respiration. PM20D1 has also been implicated in neurological diseases. PM20D1 expression is increased both in vitro and in vivo following neurotoxic insults. Forced overexpression of PM20D1 in the hippocampus results in improved learning performance in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease whereas PM20D1 knockdown increases amyloid plaque load.  Clinical significance  In human visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes, PM20D1 is one of the most highly up-regulated genes by the anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione drug rosiglitazone, suggesting a potential role for this enzyme and/or N-fatty acyl amino acids in obesity and diabetes. Methylation at or near the PM20D1 locus has been correlated to body mass index. In humans, the PM20D1 locus has been associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Inspired by the 2000 Gregory Hoblit film of the same name, Frequency was developed by Jeremy Carver. The series was canceled on May 8, 2017; five days later, an epilogue to the series was released. Premise In 2016, NYPD Detective Raimy Sullivan discovers that she is able to speak to her deceased father Frank Sullivan in 1996 via his old ham radio. Her attempts to save his life trigger the \\"butterfly effect\\", changing the present in unforeseen ways. To fix the damage, she must work with her father across time to solve a decades-old murder case. Cast and characters =Main= * Peyton List as Raimy Elizabeth Sullivan: An NYPD detective who experiences an unusual weather phenomenon that allows her to communicate with her late father through radio transmissions. Born and raised in Queens, Raimy is stationed at the 21st Precinct (the same precinct her father worked out of in 1996) and has been since the start of her career in 2008. She achieved the rank of detective in 2014. After changing the timeline by conversing with her father, Raimy seems to be the only one who notices the changes. Now, she and Frank work across time to solve the Nightingale murders before her mother can become the killer's next victim. * Riley Smith as Francis Joseph \\"Frank\\" Sullivan: Raimy's father and an NYPD detective in 1996. He was originally killed while working undercover and posthumously accused of being corrupt, but survived when Raimy changed the timeline by warning him of his impending death. In the new timeline caused by his survival in 1996, Frank saw his daughter grow up and graduate from the police academy, and even served as her training officer in 2008. He dies in a car crash in 2011. * Devin Kelley as Julie Elizabeth Sullivan: Raimy's mother and Frank's widow who, once the timeline is changed so that her husband survives, is killed by the Nightingale. * Mekhi Phifer as Detective (1996)/Lieutenant (2016) Satch Reyna: Frank's partner who now runs the 21st Precinct's Detective Squad where Raimy works. He and Stan Moreno were patrol officers in the late 1980s. In the original timeline, Satch's marriage collapsed in the intervening 20 years, and he became estranged from his children. * Anthony Ruivivar as Captain Stan Moreno: The 21st Precinct Commander who, as a narcotics detective in 1996, was responsible for the undercover operation that resulted in Frank's death. In the original timeline, then-Sergeant Moreno, already a legendary narcotics detective, served as Raimy's training officer in 2008. Frank and Raimy believe he is corrupt. * Lenny Jacobson as Gordo: Raimy's childhood friend. * Daniel Bonjour as Daniel Lawrence: Raimy's fianc√© in 2016. When Raimy alters the timeline to save her father, she is horrified to discover that she and Daniel have never met and he is dating another woman. Nevertheless, she retains memories of their previous romance. When the timeline is again altered, their engagement is restored by the end of the series. =Recurring= * Ada Breker as young Raimy * Sandy Robson as Mike Rainey * Brad Kelly as \\"Little Jay\\" Garza * Alexandra Metz as Maya Gowan * Michael Charles Roman as Thomas Goff: A suspect in the Nightingale murders. * David Lipper as Robbie Womack * Melinda Page Hamilton as Marilyn Goff * Britt McKillip as young Meghan * Kenneth Mitchell as Deacon Joe Hurley: A suspect in the Nightingale murders. * Rob Mayes as Detective Kyle Moseby: A fellow NYPD detective who in the changed timeline has a sexual relationship with Raimy.

His father was in business with John Pretor Pinney, from 1783. Tobin was educated at King Edward VI School, Southampton and Wadham College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1787, and graduated B.A. in 1792.s:Page:Alumni Oxoniensis (1715-1886) volume 4.djvu/212 From 1795, until his brother John's death in 1804, they lived together in London. In the 1790s Tobin befriended Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth; Wordsworth knew, through Basil Montagu and Francis Wrangham, the sons of John Pretor Pinney, and may have met Tobin through Montagu, or the Pinneys. Tobin brought Tom Wedgewood to meet Coleridge and Wordsworth in September 1797; Wedgwood later became Coleridge's patron.Ayumi Mishiro, William Wordsworth and Education: 1791‚Äì1802 at p. 134 In letters of 1798, Wordsworth announced to Tobin, then James Losh, his major poetic project under the working title The Recluse. Tobin had a degenerative eye condition, and at this period he was only partially sighted, ruling out a career. During 1799 he took part in the nitrous oxide experiments of Humphry Davy. He was an observer when Davy experimented with other inhalations. From 1807 Tobin and his family were on Nevis. He took a leading part in the cruelty case brought in 1810 against the plantation owner Edward Huggins; Huggins had bought the Montravers estate on Nevis from the Pretor Pinney family in 1808. Huggins was acquitted; Tobin made his views known, writing in particular to Hugh Elliot, the Governor of the Leeward Islands, claiming that the jury was packed. The Christian Observer noted that Tobin's blindness meant he could not be challenged to a duel for his stand. James Stephen wrote that others who backed him did not escape feuds. Works Tobin contributed to The Annual Anthology edited by Robert Southey, and edited its third volume (1802).Kenneth Curry, The Contributors to \\"The Annual Anthology\\", The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America Vol. 42, No. 1 (First Quarter, 1948), pp. 50‚Äì65, at p. 60.

Biography Halim√© was born in the town of Salamat in 1930 to a mother from Salamat and a father from Abeche. She became involved with the Parti Progressiste Tchadien (PPT) in 1950 while working as a Quranic instructor. She was able to bring in more women who did not know French due to her knowledge of Chadian Arabic. At the time she had only a limited grasp of French. She was particularly close to Gabriel Lisette, the founder of the party, and his wife, Lisette Y√©yon. She became responsible for recruiting Northern women following the General Meeting of 2 April 1950. Halim√© harshly criticized the colonial administration's poll tax, and declared that if the PPT secured a victory, the poll tax would be abolished for all despite the platform calling for ending the tax only on women. She explained that \\"women were arrested on their arrival on the market or anywhere. They were left in the sun until they paid the tax which was 370 riyals per person.\\" She declared that Lisette was the undisputed leader of the party, despite the rise of Southern Chadian politician Fran√ßois Tombalbaye, and traveled to France on Lisette's urging to meet with the French politician Rene Coty. However, in 1959 and 1960 Tombalbaye gained power and Lisette was removed from power. Halim√© became the target of repression soon after independence, unlike her PPT female colleague Kaltouma Nguembang. As part of a purge of those near to Lisette, Halim√©'s only son was murdered, and she was arrested in September 1963. At first, she was taken to Massenya in Chari-Baguirmi Region, then to a central prison in Chad's capital of N'Djamena, and finally to a dreaded prison at Kela. At the Kela prison, she was regularly tortured by guards through electrocution while French and Israeli army officers supervised. Her torture resulted in her losing all her fingernails and hair. Despite Tombalbaye wanting Halim√© to be killed, a French officer spared her life. In an interview, she stated that only her faith was able to keep her going through the difficult circumstances of torture. She was finally released on 28 April 1975, days after the overthrow ofTombalbaye and his regime. Out of 600 people who were imprisoned during this purge, she was one of only 45 who lived. Lisette, who had been exiled in France, helped bring her to Paris to receive medical treatment. Halim√© spent time in a hospital in Cote d'Ivoire, where the president Felix Houphouet-Boigny mandated that her medical care was free. She later joined the National Liberation Front of Chad or FROLINAT, which was based in Libya. In 1978, she moved to Tripoli and returned to politics. FROLINAT members dubbed her \\"the mother of the revolution\\", and the party seized power in 1979. She also began educating girls in Libya and founded an Islamic school, the Rising New Generation, where she taught religion, home economics, and child care. She taught over 3600 girls at the school during her years there. She returned to N'Djamena in 1980 with the Popular Armed Forces (FAP) leader Goukouni Oueddei. She was then the president of the women's faction of FROLINAT. After the election of Hiss√®ne Habr√© in 1982, she left with forces loyal to Ouedde√Ø in Libya. While in Libya, Halim√© taught military skills to exiled Chadian women. She returned to Chad in 1991, a year after the overthrow of Habr√© by Idriss D√©by. Many people told Deby they would support him only if he received the backing of Halim√©, which she eventually did. Shortly after her return, she won a seat in Chad's parliament and served there until 1996. In 1993, she participated in the National Sovereign Conference (CNS), and was one of the most fervent defenders of the Arabic language. In 1994, she created an association called Women Az-Zara. On behalf of the association, she was voted among ten women candidates to be a member of the Higher Council of Transition, staying four years. In June 1996, she ran for parliament as a member of the opposition National Front of Chad party, as it was impossible to run as an independent. She was defeated but maintained the election was rigged. Halim√© afterwards cared for orphans whose parents were killed in the Habr√© regime. She also opened an Arabic school in N'Djamena. She went on six pilgrimages to Mecca in her life, including one last trip in 2000. She died on 7 January 2001, and is fondly remembered as a women's resistance figure in Chad today. Summing up her legacy, she stated, \\"I fought for the people as I struggled against the colonizer.\\" References Category:2001 deaths Category:Chadian women in politics Category:Chadian educators Category:1930 births Category:20th-century women politicians Category:People from Salamat Region Category:Chadian Progressive Party politicians ","title":"Hadj√© Halim√©"},{"id":"50531340","text":"In mathematical analysis, epi-convergence is a type of convergence for real- valued and extended real-valued functions. Epi-convergence is important because it is the appropriate notion of convergence with which to approximate minimization problems in the field of mathematical optimization. The symmetric notion of hypo-convergence is appropriate for maximization problems. Mosco convergence is a generalization of epi-convergence to infinite dimensional spaces.  Definition  Let X be a metric space, and f^{ u}: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} a real-valued function for each natural number u . We say that the sequence (f^{ u}) epi-converges to a function f: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} if for each x \\\\in X : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\liminf_{ u \\\\to \\\\infty} f^{ u}(x^ u) \\\\geq f(x) \\\\text{ for every } x^ u \\\\to x \\\\text{ and }  & \\\\limsup_{ u \\\\to \\\\infty} f^ u(x^ u) \\\\leq f(x) \\\\text{ for some } x^ u \\\\to x. \\\\end{align} = Extended real-valued extension = The following extension allows epi- convergence to be applied to a sequence of functions with non-constant domain. Denote by \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{R}}= \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\pm \\\\infty \\\\\\\\} the extended real numbers. Let f^ u be a function f^ u:X \\\\to \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{R}} for each u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} . The sequence (f^ u) epi-converges to f: X \\\\to \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{R}} if for each x \\\\in X : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\liminf_{ u \\\\to \\\\infty} f^{ u}(x^ u) \\\\geq f(x) \\\\text{ for every } x^ u \\\\to x \\\\text{ and }  & \\\\limsup_{ u \\\\to \\\\infty} f^ u(x^ u) \\\\leq f(x) \\\\text{ for some } x^ u \\\\to x. \\\\end{align} In fact, epi-convergence coincides with the \\\\Gamma-convergence in first countable spaces. = Hypo- convergence = Epi-convergence is the appropriate topology with which to approximate minimization problems. For maximization problems one uses the symmetric notion of hypo-convergence. (f^ u) hypo-converges to f if : \\\\limsup_{ u \\\\to \\\\infty} f^ u(x^ u) \\\\leq f(x) \\\\text{ for every } x^ u \\\\to x and : \\\\liminf_{ u \\\\to \\\\infty} f^ u(x^ u) \\\\geq f(x) \\\\text{ for some } x^ u \\\\to x. Relationship to minimization problems Assume we have a difficult minimization problem : \\\\inf_{x \\\\in C} g(x) where g: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} and C \\\\subseteq X . We can attempt to approximate this problem by a sequence of easier problems : \\\\inf_{x \\\\in C^{ u}} g^ u(x) for functions g^ u and sets C^ u . Epi-convergence provides an answer to the question: In what sense should the approximations converge to the original problem in order to guarantee that approximate solutions converge to a solution of the original? We can embed these optimization problems into the epi-convergence framework by defining extended real-valued functions : \\\\begin{align} f(x) & = \\\\begin{cases} g(x), & x \\\\in C,  \\\\infty, & x ot \\\\in C, \\\\end{cases} \\\\[4pt] f^ u(x) & = \\\\begin{cases} g^ u(x), & x \\\\in C^ u,  \\\\infty, & x ot \\\\in C^ u. \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} So that the problems \\\\inf_{x \\\\in X} f(x) and \\\\inf_{x \\\\in X} f^ u(x) are equivalent to the original and approximate problems, respectively. If (f^ u) epi-converges to f , then \\\\limsup_{ u \\\\to \\\\infty} [\\\\inf f^ u] \\\\leq \\\\inf f . Furthermore, if x is a limit point of minimizers of f^ u , then x is a minimizer of f . In this sense, : \\\\lim_{v \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\operatorname{argmin} f^ u \\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{argmin} f. Epi-convergence is the weakest notion of convergence for which this result holds.  Properties  * (f^ u) epi-converges to f if and only if (-f^ u) hypo-converges to -f . * (f^ u) epi-converges to f if and only if (\\\\operatorname{epi} f^ u) converges to \\\\operatorname{epi} f as sets, in the Painlev√©‚ÄìKuratowski sense of set convergence. Here, \\\\operatorname{epi} f is the epigraph of the function f . * If f^ u epi-converges to f , then f is lower semi-continuous. * If f^ u is convex for each u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} and (f^ u) epi-converges to f , then f is convex. * If f^ u_1 \\\\leq f^ u \\\\leq f^ u_2 and both (f_1^ u) and (f_2^ u) epi-converge to f , then (f^ u) epi-converges to f . * If (f^ u) converges uniformly to f on each compact set of \\\\mathbb{R}^n and (f^ u) are continuous, then (f^ u) epi-converges and hypo-converges to f . * In general, epi-convergence neither implies nor is implied by pointwise convergence. Additional assumptions can be placed on an pointwise convergent family of functions to guarantee epi-convergence. References * R. Tyrrell Rockafellar and Roger Wets, Variational Analysis.

Origins  The titles and powers over discovered lands granted to Christopher Columbus were entered in the capitulations of Santa Fe agreed on April 17 of 1492. Under them, the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, awarded for the period of his life, and after his death, to be conferred on his heirs or Successors one after the other perpetually: * The title of Admiral of the Ocean Sea over all the islands and the mainland that discovered or won in this sea. * The titles, always referred to together, of \\"Viceroy and Governor General\\". In addition, other powers and economic prerogatives. These titles would be confirmed by the monarchs on his return from his first voyage in May 1493. Of these, the best known in Castile, which paid the most attention both Columbus and the monarchs, was the Admiral.  History  According to the capitulations of Santa Fe, all lands discovered by Christopher Columbus were part of his viceroyalty: In his first trip to the Americas (it got to Guanahani on 12 October 1492), Columbus discovered the Bahamas, Cuba and The Hispaniola, exerting his position as viceroy and governor in them, leaving to return to Spain to 39 men in La Navidad in Hispaniola, which was founded on December 25, 1492. the fort was destroyed shortly then by the Indians of the island, killing all its occupants. Christopher Columbus Travels On his second trip in 1493 Christopher Columbus discovered Guadalupe and other islands located on the side of Atlantic Ocean between it and Puerto Rico, the which it arrived on 19 November 1493. Later he found Jamaica and explored Cuba. On his return to Spain in 1496 discovered the Lesser Antilles located on the side of Caribbean Sea between Puerto Rico and Dominica. On his third trip in 1498 discovered Trinidad, Paria Peninsula and the Island of Margarita, remaining until 1500 in Hispaniola. The kings sent to the Spanish as pesquisador judge (with government functions) to Francisco de Bobadilla in 1500, which upon arrival (August 23) arrested Columbus and his brothers and sailed Spain, dismissing him from the government. Columbus refused to be removed the shackles around his trip to Spain, during which he wrote a long letter to the Catholic Monarchs. Upon arriving to Spain he regained his freedom, but had lost prestige, its powers and the viceroyality. Bobadilla was also relieved of his government and replaced by Nicolas de Ovando in 1502. On his fourth trip, in 1502, he found St. Lucia and Martinique. He then toured the Central American coast from the Bay Islands to Gulf of Urab√°. He remained in Jamaica until 1504 and then returned to Spain died on May 20, 1506 in Convent of San Francisco of Valladolid. Since 1499 the kings authorized other trips of discovery without the authorization of Columbus, including those of Alonso de Ojeda and Vicente Y√°√±ez Pinz√≥n, creating for them governments in the territories they discovered: the governorate Coquibacoa on the coast of Venezuela, except Paria discovered by Columbus was for De Ojeda and Pinz√≥n the governor off the coast of Brazil between the Amazon river and the Cape Holy Mary of Consolation. These governorates were exempted from the Viceroyalty of the Indies.  The Viceroyalty after the death of Columbus  On Christopher Columbus's death his eldest son Diego Columbus inherited his father's rights in the Americas, including the viceroyalty. However, King Ferdinand refused at first to transfer all rights of his father and appointed him governor of Hispaniola in 1508. Diego began a series of lawsuits against the crown known as the Columbian Lawsuits, and in 1511 his rights as viceroy were recognized, but with limited jurisdiction over those territories that had been officially discovered by his father. Consequently, Diego Columbus became the second Viceroy of the Indies. He died in 1526 bequeathing his rights to the viceroyalty to his son Luis Col√≥n. During the minority of Luis Col√≥n the transaction occurred and arbitration that ended Columbian Lawsuits with the Spanish crown and in 1537 he received the knighthood of this I Duke of Veragua and Manor territorial six hundred twenty-five square leagues, composed of lands of ancient Veragua and Castilla del Oro.

Klein advocated reward-based training. He did not believe in punishing the animals, but rather teaching wanted behaviors and rewarding them when they happened. Training should be based on \\"trust and cooperation\\" rather than fear or dominance or intimidation, according to Klein. He advocated that dogs and their owners should have a healthy \\"foundation of interaction\\" comparable to a supportive parent-child relationship. Dogs with separation anxiety or problems living alone can be helped by day-care, according to Klein. He advocated clicker training and hand signals as teaching methods. He liked to find out what things a dog wanted most, and then used that as a reward to encourage positive behavior; for example, in one instance, he found that a difficult Pomeranian valued her dog bed, and Klein used that as a reward.

When a family has a new baby, he advocated a calm period of adjustment to get a dog and the baby used to each other, and continuing to give the pet the same attention as before. Klein opposed surgical methods to remove or soften a dog's bark, sometimes known as debarking or devocalization. He saw debarking as a \\"quick fix\\" but which prevents a dog from communicating with humans or other animals, which can cause other long term problems. Klein attended Phillips Academy in Andover from 1971-1973, graduated from Palisades Charter High School in 1974, and earned a BA from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1980.

He also worked on the broadcast team for the League of Legends World Championship from 2013 to 2015. In 2013 and 2014, he was a coach for Counter Logic Gaming, and from 2015 to 2016 he owned Renegades. He was employed as a shoutcaster for the Overwatch League from 2017 to 2019. In 2020, he became the commissioner of Flashpoint, a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league, and a vice president of the league's parent company.  Career  Mykles's first involvement with esports was as a volunteer writer for WCReplays, a Warcraft 3 replays site. He began shoutcasting for WCReplays with David \\"Phreak\\" Turley, later attesting that casting came naturally to him due to many years of stage performance. During his involvement with Warcraft 3, he managed a professional team with Verge Gaming and joined the Team Sportscast Network, a now defunct esports shoutcasting organization. He later accepted a full-time contract casting position at OnGameNet as an English-language caster for League of Legends Champions Korea. Mykles, Erik \\"DoA\\" Lonnquist, and Christopher \\"PapaSmithy\\" Smith declined to commentate at the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational in Shanghai because of a wage dispute with Riot. In April 2017, Mykles and Lonnquist announced they would be moving from South Korea to the United States to serve as shoutcasters for the Overwatch League. After two seasons with the league, Mykles announced that he would no longer be casting for the OWL ahead of the 2020 season. After leaving the Overwatch League, he co-founded and briefly worked for an esports advisory firm, before leaving to become a content creator for Cloud9.

The punishment stemmed from charges of not properly disclosing team ownership, misleading player trades, and player mistreatment. Renegades later sold their LoL team to Team EnVyUs.

Biography Born on 23 November 1828 in S√∂derby in Uppsala Municipality, von D√ºben was the daughter of Major Robert von Bahr and Eva Carolina √Ökerhielm af Margretelund. In 1857, she married Baron Gustaf von D√ºben, a doctor of medicine and professor of pathological anatomy at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm who from 1868 began to compile a catalogue of Lapp skulls. It was illustrated with photographs taken by Lotten von D√ºben, probably based on the approach adopted by Carl Curman who had a photographic studio in the building where the couple lived. On 3 July 1868, the von D√ºbens left Stockholm by ship on the first expedition to Lapland, undertaking a study of the Sami people. They took with them all the heavy photographic equipment they needed to produce iodinated collodion negatives. Using a stereo camera, Lotten von D√ºhen photographed the Samis first from the front, then in profile. In 1871, they returned to the area, this time with two cameras. To document their findings, in 1873 Gustaf von D√ºben published Om Lappland och Lapparne, f√∂retr√§desvis de Svenske: Ethnografiska Studier af Gustaf von D√ºben which was illustrated with his wife's photographs. Von D√ºben also took many landscape photographs of the Swedish mountains and waterfalls during her trips to Lapland. Unlike her contemporaries, she photographed the scenery to provide a record for herself rather than to sell the images. Taken in the open air rather than in a studio, her portraits show the Sami in their natural environment. Together with the work of Bertha Valerius and Rosalie Sj√∂man, von D√ºben's photographs constitute an important chapter in the history of Swedish photography.

The eFlyer 2 was first publicly introduced at the Centennial Airport in Colorado on 11 May 2016. Ground and taxi tests on the prototype were started in November 2016. A four-seater derivative model, named the Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer 4, was announced in July 2017. It will be a day/night IFR aircraft with an payload, capable of maximum cruise speed and a 4.2 hour endurance. The eFlyer 2 first flew on 10 April 2018. AEAC and Bye Aerospace merged in 2018 and Bye Aerospace took over the project. Development of the four-seater should follow completion of the smaller eFlyer 2, the certification of which is forecast to cost US$25 million. Bye had received 220 orders for the two models by October 2018. By January 2019, Subaru and SBI Investment invested in Bye Aerospace to advance the eFlyer 2 certification. On 8 February 2019 the eFlyer 2 flew for the first time in its intended production configuration, including with a Siemens SP70D electric motor. FAA Part 23 Certification is planned for 2020, with Siemens taking an active part. Design The aircraft is intended to be certified under FAR 23 and supplied as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft. It has been designed specifically for the flight training market and is projected to have a 3.5 hour duration. The eFlyer 2 features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seat side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single Siemens SP70D electric motor in tractor configuration powered by up to six Lithium-ion battery packs. The design has a gross weight of and is made from composite material, primarily carbon fibre. The cockpit employs an iPad used for cockpit instrumentation display, including motor, battery and aircraft systems. The aircraft connects to Redbird Flight Simulations' Sidekick system, which wirelessly tracks the eFlyer's motor, flight time, physical location and attitude in real time when in flight. The Siemens SP70D has a takeoff rating of and continuous. Utah-based Electric Power Systems provides the 92-kWh energy storage including battery modules, management and distribution. The cruise aircraft is projected to have hourly operating costs one-sixth of a piston-powered Cessna 172. Operational history By February 2019, one example, the prototype had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration. By December 2018 the company had 220 deposits, split evenly between the eFlyer 2 and eFlyer 4, growing to 298 by April 2019.

He was an Member of the Legislative Assembly for East Londonderry from 2016 until 2017, when he was deselected by the SDLP in favour of John Dallat, who returned to politics following a short retirement.  Political career  Mullan was first elected as a councillor to Limavady Borough Council in 2001 representing the Bellarena ward for the Social Democratic and Labour Party. He served on the council for thirteen years and was appointed as the last Mayor of Limavady in 2014. In 2014, Limavady Borough Council was merged with Ballymoney Borough Council, Coleraine Borough Council and Moyle District Council to become Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council; Mullan won a seat on the new council. At the 2015 United Kingdom general election, Mullan was selected to represent the SDLP standing for election in East Londonderry. However, he lost to the incumbent Democratic Unionist Party's Gregory Campbell. In 2016, Mullan was selected to stand for the Northern Ireland Assembly in East Londonderry, taking over from John Dallat, who was retiring. Mullan was elected to the Assembly and managed to retain the seat for the SDLP. He resigned his seat on the council as a result in order to take up the role as an MLA. However, Dallat announced he would be returning to politics after seven months of retirement and following an SDLP selection hearing, Dallat was selected to be the SDLP's only candidate in East Londonderry ahead of Mullan at the next Assembly election in a move supported by the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. After being deselected by the SDLP, Mullan announced he was quitting the party after twenty years of membership and looking to take legal action, citing his deselection, believing his local constituency should have decided, not the central party, and stating that the SDLP was no longer the party he had joined. The media viewed this as part of a personal feud between Mullan and Dallat. Supporters of Mullan put up posters around County Londonderry alleging Dallat was enriching himself by him taking retirement severance and running again after such a short retirement period, though Mullan himself had not endorsed this action. Dallat's daughter, Helena Dallat O'Driscoll, took Mullan to an employment tribunal, alleging he had discriminated against her on marital and gender grounds by refusing to employ her in his constituency office. The case was dismissed, however, after Dallat's daughter failed to pay the ¬£200 court fee. Mullan announced his intention to stand in the 2017 Assembly elections as an independent to try to retain his seat but was not elected.East Londonderry, bbc.co.uk; accessed 4 March 2017.

His repertoire ranged from rock and roll, rockabilly and country music. He was known for his wild antics on stage, which sometimes included destroying a piano with an axe or chainsaw. Biography Born in Consett, Durham in 1937, Lee lost his right eye following an accident with a dart thrown by his father. He would later sometimes cover this eye with a pirate patch. Working as a scaffolder in London in the mid-1950s he taught himself to play his landlady's piano. His music career began in the late 1950s as the guitarist of a skiffle band. His music direction was influenced by Jerry Lee Lewis and he later said, \\"when I was a child I was impressed by Winifred Atwell who played piano and I did not think we could play this instrument as did Jerry Lee Lewis.\\" He then joined Screaming Lord Sutch as pianist beside the young Ritchie Blackmore on guitar. He then toured with Eden Kane, Cliff Richard and Marty Wilde. In 1960 be became the guitarist for the Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages - it was Sutch who gave him his nickname - but moved to piano after Ritchie Blackmore joined the band. He often wore an eye patch over his right eye. In the 1960s, Lee made many tours across Europe. Playing in the Star-Club in Hamburg, he met the Beatles and later said, \\"I am from the same background as them, the working class with the same ideal.\\" He also played with many of his heroes including Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Gene Vincent and the Crickets. Forming his own band in 1965, an early member was Ian Hunter, later to form Mott The Hoople. He released the singles \\"The Friendly Undertaker\\" (1965) and \\"Bossy Boss\\" (1966). His stage antics continued - with pianos destroyed with chainsaws and explosives. In 1978 Lee joined Jack Good's revival of his successful 1950s show Oh Boy!. It was during this show that Lee took to wearing an eye patch. Lee was notable performer on the show and made a star of Shakin' Stevens. Lee also released two albums, Freddie Fingers Lee (1978) and Ol‚Äô One-Eye‚Äôs Back (1979). Lee appeared in the 1980 film Blue Suede Shoes which detailed the revival of 1950s rock 'n' roll music scene at the time. He destroys a piano at the end of his song with an axe. Throughout the 1980s, Lee made many appearance at rock and roll festivals and played extensively across Europe. He suffered two strokes in 2002 and 2006 which ended his stage career. Death Forced to retire from live stage appearance, Lee died on 13 January 2014 at the age of 76 from pneumonia in Newcastle, England.

Rather than acting as a conventional enzyme inhibitor, a PROTAC works by inducing selective intracellular proteolysis. PROTACs consist of two covalently linked protein-binding molecules: one capable of engaging an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and another that binds to a target protein meant for degradation. Recruitment of the E3 ligase to the target protein results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the proteasome. Because PROTACs need only to bind their targets with high selectivity (rather than inhibit the target protein's enzymatic activity), there are currently many efforts to retool previously ineffective inhibitor molecules as PROTACs for next-generation drugs. Initially described by Kathleen Sakamoto, Craig Crews and Ray Deshaies in 2001, the PROTAC technology has been applied by a number of drug discovery labs using various E3 ligases, including pVHL, Mdm2, beta-TrCP1, cereblon, and c-IAP1. Yale University licensed the PROTAC technology to Arvinas in 2013‚Äì14.  Mechanism  Protacs achieve degradation through \\"hijacking\\" the cell's Ubiquitin‚ÄìProteosome system (UPS). The UPS consists of an E1 activating enzyme which conjugates to an E2 enzyme transferring a ubiquitin molecule to the E2. E2 then binds to the E3 ligase in a complex which can then recognize target proteins for subsequent ubiquitin tagging and degradation by the 26S proteosome.

In the public sphere, he initiated \\"Ad Astra\\", an association of scientists from Romania and Romanian diaspora,Science - Reaching for the Stars in Romania and has been actively involved in efforts to reform Romania's post-communist science and academia.Nature - Scientists in Romania and Bulgaria are having the best and the worst of times. Career Studying the sediment transfer system through rivers into and inside the ocean, he focuses especially on river deltas and has worked in the Danube, Indus, Ebro, Mackenzie among other regions. His work includes contributions reported on by National GeographicNational Geographic - \\"Noah's Flood\\" Not Rooted in Reality, After All? on the so-called \\"Noah's Flood\\" or the Black Sea deluge hypothesis, New York Times,The New York Times - An Ancient Civilization, Upended by Climate ChangeThe New York Times - From Ancient Deforestation, a Delta Is Born on the collapse of the ancient urban Indus Valley Civilisation and the long term impact of deforestation on the Danube Delta and the Black Sea, BBCBBC - Major deltas 'could be drowned' on the drowning of river deltas under human-induced climate changes. Giosan started his career studying the Danube delta. This work led to a classification of deltas highlighting the constructive role of waves and to the discovery of an asymmetric (polygenetic) end-member. These advances, together with novel ideas on river mouth morphodynamics, inspired approaches to numerically model river delta evolution and architecture. After producing the first accurate evolution model of the Danube Delta, Giosan explored the dramatic effects of early deforestation on the Danube and Black Sea as a type example of how humans have unintentionally affected the coastal ocean for millennia. Together with colleagues spanning disciplines from paleogenetics to engineering, he linked the rapid growth of the Danube delta in the last 2000 years to deforestation that started under the Roman Empire and accelerated during the Ottoman Empire's expansion in Europe. Paleo-DNA preserved in sediments indicated the ecosystem of the whole Black Sea has changed following the deforestation as Danube brought in more nutrients and silica from eroding soils. The magnitude of these changes for a continental-size system such as the Danube-Black Sea is a prime argument for an early Anthropocene epoch. In 2003, after discovering of a large submarine extension of the Indus delta, Giosan and his colleagues started to explore the Holocene history of the Indus River and its ancient urban Indus Valley Civilisation. Their analyses of landscape and human settlement dynamics along the Indus and its tributaries offered ample field-based support for a climatic theory of the Indus Civilization collapse. Landscape semi-fossilization as the Indian monsoon declined and aridity increased demonstrates that floods became erratic and less extensive making inundation agriculture less sustainable. Their studies also showed that the Ghaggar-Hakra, a former Indus tributary or a river flowing between the Indus and the Ganges watersheds and the most likely candidate for Sarasvati River of mythical fame, retracted its reach toward the foothills of the Himalaya. That region continued to be populated by the Indus people long after the collapse of their cities. Further work by Giosan's team in peninsular India highlighted the regional character of the impact of such climate changes: while the Indus civilization collapsed under the monsoon decline, people of the peninsula expanded agriculture to cope with aridity. In interviews,Oceanus - Climate Change Spurred Fall of Ancient Culture Giosan compared the ancient Indus collapse to the present dependence on fossil fuels and introduced the term \\"Goldilocks civilization\\" to underline their non- sustainable character. In 2014, together with other leading deltaic researchers, he examined the global health of river deltas showing that these vast coastal lowlands cannot withstand the predicted rise in sea level for the next century and calling for maintenance and reconstruction measures.Giosan, L., Syvitski, J.P.M., Constantinescu, S., Day, J., 2014, Protect the World‚Äôs Deltas, Nature, 516: 31-33. Using again Danube delta as an example, Giosan and his colleagues showed that the expansion of a shallow channel network used for fishing in the mid 20th century had beneficial effects by trapping sediments on the delta plain and counteracting sea level rise effects. This channelization of the delta plain, which mimics natural deltas in their youth, emerged as one of the methods for delta reconstruction. Public life In 2000 Giosan initiated and co-founded \\"Ad Astra\\", an association of academics dedicated to the reform of science and education in post-communist Romania. Occasionally he publishes analyses and OpEd texts in the Romanian media such as Rom√¢nia CuratƒÉ, AdevƒÉrul, or Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ.

She left Spain in 1712 with four other founding nuns to Lima, Peru to establish a new Capuchin convent. She was an example of the early modern women who were a part of the expansion of the Atlantic world. Her documentation of her journey is the oldest known travel document written by a woman. It was very atypical for a woman to be literate much less travel to the new world. During the Council of Trent, nuns were strictly enclosed within the walls of their convents. The only exception to this being for the founding of new convents. Her account of her journey is a valuable insight to a pious woman's interpretation of the world outside of the cloistered walls of a covenant and proof that a woman, particularly one tied down by a strict Catholic council, had a burning spirit of mission with ‚Äúequal flame‚Äù to those of so many men in Catholic Europe.  Biography  Not much is known about Mar√≠a. She was born in Madrid on January 14, 1660. Her parents were Joseph de Leon y Ayala and Estefania Mu√±oz. Her given name was Josepha de Leon y Ayala but changed it to Maria Rosa when she became a nun. This was a customary practice. She entered the Capuchin covenant at the age of seventeen in 1677. She was appointed first mother abbess of the new convent to be founded in Lima. Because of this, she left Spain never to return again in 1712 with four other founding nuns. She documented her whole journey almost day by day to leave her account for both her original convent back in Madrid and the new one in Lima. One month before her death, she stepped down from her position and her co-founder, Mar√≠a Gertrudis was elected abbess. She passed away August 14, 1716 at the age of fifty-six.  Journey  Mar√≠a Rosa's journey across the Atlantic ocean was full of remarkable adventures and adversities. Her account of it was so incredibly important because it was the first known travel document written by a woman. The need for a new convent in Lima came from the efforts of a group of religious lay women who were living together to become Capuchin nuns. The Capuchin order in Madrid was selected to send five nuns to found the new nunnery. The five original founders were:Madre Mar√≠a Rosa (abbess), Madre Maria Estefania (vicaress), Madre Maria Gertrud's (turn keeper), Madre Maria Bernarda (novice mistress) and Madre Josepha Victoria (council member). Journey took total of three years; it was delayed on Iberian Peninsula for two of those years when they were captured by the Dutch enemy. Their journey was incredibly dangerous due to the Spanish War of Succession that was underway at the time making a long, traitorous trip like theirs that much more difficult. The nuns were likely exposed to ideas and books about New World during their imprisonment in the Iberian Peninsula. A ‚Äútapestry of influences‚Äù in Mar√≠a's manuscripts is evident, this was probably due to other documented accounts of similar travels found and available for reading in different convents she may have stayed in during her pilgrimage to the new world. Maria Rosa took it upon herself to chronicle daily events of their travels so that their future sisters in Peru and back in Spain could trace the footsteps of their pilgrimage. This manuscript is special because it is read through Maria's narration, and proves that women played and active role in colonial enterprise. Her writing is ‚Äúlively and multilayered‚Äù. It allows for reconsideration of assumptions about early modern religious women. They weren't so bland and tasteless clearly since Mar√≠a's narrative style had personality and sass. Since nuns were mandated to be strictly enclosed in the walls of their convents, with barely any communication to the outside world, Maria's experience was extraordinary and impressive and even more so since she documented it thoroughly. The sophistication of her account is impressive, Maria like most religious women of her time, had only informal mechanisms of education and this was probably only due to the fact that she was a nun and probably born of elite class already prior to joining her convent. But most women were not literate at all at this time. Typically the only women who could were nuns so they were able to read scriptures and teach new incoming sisters how to read and write. Women were often oppressed and silenced when successful which was probably why her writings were never discovered or reverenced as they are today. Sarah Owens found the original manuscripts of Mar√≠a's account in the National Library in Madrid and decided it was a wonderful story of ‚Äútravel and adventure‚Äù that had to be published. Because of this series, Mar√≠a Rosa's experiences are now accessible to scholars, students, and anyone interested in early women's history.  References   Bibliography  * * Gelbart, Nina Rattner.

It can be found as a disjunct distribution in Western Europe from the Azores, Portugal and Spain to south-western Ireland and south- western United Kingdom. It also occurs in Crete, Pelion, Greece and tropical Africa. It is a prostrate perennial plant that is found in moist habitats. Taxonomy The genus Sibthorpia is named after Dr Humphry Sibthorp who was the Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford from 1747 to 1783. Description Sibthorpia europaea is a small prostrate plant forming mats of thread-like stems which root as they creep across the ground. The mid- green hairy leaves are kidney-shaped and deeply notched. The flowers are tiny and develop singly in the leaf axils. They have relatively long stalks and five pinkish corolla-lobes, and appear from June onwards. Distribution and habitat Sibthorpia europaea has a discontinuous distribution in Western Europe and tropical Africa. It is known from County Kerry in southwestern Ireland, South Wales, southwestern England, and East Sussex, Spain, Portugal, the Azores, Crete, Pelion (Greece) and tropical Africa. It may be that this unusual distribution represents remnants of a species that was more widespread in the Tertiary period. It typically inhabits moist, shady locations such as stream-banks, the sides of ditches, woodland, wet heathland, shady path verges, lawns and old walls and banks with a thin covering of soil. In Ireland it grows at altitudes up to but populations seem to be dwindling as it faces competition from the more aggressive New Zealand willowherb.

He is the father of Stephen Colbert and Elizabeth Colbert Busch. Early life and education Colbert (along with his twin sister, Margaret) was born on December 15, 1920, in the Bronx in New York City, to Mary (Tormey) and James William Colbert. He was of mostly Irish descent, and was raised in a devout Roman Catholic household. He attended St. Augustine's School in Larchmont, New York for junior high school and Iona Preparatory in New Rochelle for high school. He received his A.B. from College of the Holy Cross in 1942 in philosophy, in which he was deeply interested; nevertheless, he later chose to pursue a medical career because, according to his daughter Margaret Colbert Keegan, \\"it just seemed to be the thing to do at the time.\\" Colbert was accepted into the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1942, and received his M.D. there three years later, with a focus on immunology and infectious diseases. He then completed an internship at Bellevue Hospital before joining the U.S. Army Medical Corps in 1946. Career Colbert spent a year in Europe working for the U.S. Army Medical Corps, after which he completed a residency at Yale University School of Medicine. In 1949, he rejoined the U.S. Army Medical Corps as a representative of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, director of the Hepatitis Research Team, and technical director of the Hepatitis Laboratory in Munich, Germany. Also after 1949, he joined the faculty of Yale University School of Medicine, where he was promoted to assistant dean in 1951. In 1953, at the age of 32, he left Yale to become the dean of the St. Louis University School of Medicine, making him the youngest dean of a medical school at the time. He remained at St. Louis University until 1961, when he became associate director for extramural programs at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. During 1960 he served as chair of the St. Louis chapter of Doctors for Kennedy, to support John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. In 1969, he and his family moved from Washington, D.C., where he had been working for the National Institutes of Health, to South Carolina. He became the first vice president for academic affairs at the Medical University of South Carolina on February 1, 1969, and remained in that position until his death. His work at the Medical University of South Carolina has been credited with \\"la[ying] the foundation for MUSC's rise as a nationally renowned academic medical center.\\" Personal life Colbert married his childhood sweetheart, Lorna Elizabeth Tuck, on August 26, 1944. They soon started a family, and had eleven children together, eight of whom are alive: Jim, Ed, Mary, Margo, Tom, Jay, politician and businesswoman Elizabeth Colbert Busch, and comedian Stephen Colbert. Two of his sons, Paul and Peter, died in the same plane crash that killed their father in 1974, and Bill died in August 1999. =Death= Colbert, along with two of his sons, died in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 on September 11, 1974, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Recognition In 2009, MUSC renamed its education center and library in memory of Colbert. In 2017, the first James W. Colbert Endowed Lectureship was held, also at MUSC, in honor of his legacy there. The lectureship was established in his memory by his family.

Station history In mid-1916, the Royal Naval Air Service established RNAS Freiston Shores on the mudflats to the south of Frieston, Lincolnshire, to serve as a bombing and gunnery range for trainee pilots of the RNAS Flying School at Cranwell. As aircraft using the range had to fly for 40 minutes from Cranwell, in September 1916 about of farmland nearby were requisitioned to serve as a landing ground. As training continued, the landing ground was enlarged with hangars, accommodation, and a control tower. As well as its training role, it also became home to a flight of Bristol Scouts based there on anti-Zeppelin operations. On 1 April 1918 the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and it was renamed RAF Freiston, designated the School of Aerial Fighting and Bomb Dropping, and later renamed No. 4 School of Aerial Fighting, and then No. 4 Fighting School, to train pilots in air gunnery and bomb dropping operations.

It was owned and operated by Grupo Financiero Universal until the latter's bankruptcy in the late-1980s and was headquartered in Santo Domingo.  Founding and early years  The channel's origins are traced as far back as 1959. Pedro Bonilla, owner of Radio HIN, expressed the will to launch a private television station and launches Rahintel (Radio HIN Televisi√≥n) on February 28, 1959 in a shop located near the grounds of the Fair of Peace and Fraternity of the Free World, which had recently opened at the time. The initial purpose of the creator and, therefore, of the TV company in general were, initially, to contribute to the education of the population and to serve the economic and industrial sectors as a vehicle for promoting their products. Artistically, Rahintel was a little more liberal in contrast to La Voz Dominicana (the current 4RD). However, this climate of artistic freedom that opened in Rahintel bothered Jose Arismendy Trujillo (Petan), director of La Voz Dominicana (and brother of tyrant Rafael Leonidas Trujillo). But Pet√°n couldn't remove the plant - or even acquire it - given the links between Pepe Bonilla and Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Martinez (Ramfis). Because of that, shows like \\"La hora del moro\\" (Hour of the Chow) were created, which opened the doors to many young artists who tested their talents. This program was run by the Dominican musician Rafael Solano and he gave the start of the careers of singers such as Nini C√°ffaro. At this time, coverage was limited to the capital and some nearby towns and their programming only ran from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM and, on rare occasions, until 11. In addition to live programs, its programming consisted of American series and comedies.  Growth and expansion  Several years later, in 1966, their coverage extended into the country via channels 7 and 11 and its signal was extended to the north and northwest. Notably, in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, Rahintel operated on channel 11. However, they managed to create another frequency to transmit channel 7 in Santiago. This channel was known as Canal 7 Cibao. During the decade, Rahintel made their first satellite transmission, becoming the first channel of the Dominican Republic to do it.  Golden Age  In 1983, Pedro Bonilla sold the TV station to Grupo Financiero Universal, controlled at the time by Leonel Almonte, who would expand the plant and their television programming, along with Milton Pel√°ez, who launched offers to several shows on Color Visi√≥n. The episode of the \\"war of the ballots\\" had begun. Rahintel logo upon being acquired by Grupo Financiero Universal At the time, Rahintel won this \\"war\\" and managed to move several famous and competitive programs to the channel, having also included cartoons and anime like Force Five, Candy Candy, Thundercats, among others. In the late 80s, Grupo Financiero Universal collapses and several of their acquired artists and shows leave the channel. However, Rahintel continued broadcasting normally, still airing animated shows with good ratings.  Decline, reboost and shutdown  In the early 90s, a program called \\"Sabad√≠ssimo\\" was created and was led by Jos√© Guillermo Sued but was later removed from the schedule. Telenovelas like Mari Amor and shows like Mission: Impossible, Tarzan, MacGyver, Freddy's Nightmares and other popular shows like Nubeluz were also transmitted. By the very end of the decade, Rahintel in decline. Still, ratings surprisingly increased with reruns of Candy Candy, and managed to obtain the rights to broadcast Tigres de Licey and Leones del Escogido matches for the 1998-1999 Dominican basecall season. These two teams came to compete for the championship that season and all occurrences of that final series were transmitted by channel 7. However, despite the transmission of the matches gave them an increase in ratings, their fate was sealed. After 40 years of operations, Rahintel silently shuts down in April 1999. The frequency was sold for a sum of $15.000.000 to Grupo Mercasid, who, in October, launched a new channel, Antena Latina.

It is located in Piazza San Domenico, in the quarter of La Loggia, within the historic centre of the city. The church hosts the burials of many figures of Sicilian history and culture. For this reason it is known as the \\"Pantheon of illustrious Sicilians\\".  History  The origin of the building dates back to the Middle Ages. A first Dominican church was built on this site between 1280 and 1285. The church was in Norman‚ÄìGothic style and it was also fitted with a convent and a cloister that represented a small and simple reproduction of the more famous Benedectine cloister of Monreale.

At the beginning of the 15th century the medieval church became too small for the needs of a growing community of believers. For this reason the friars sought the financial aid of Pope Martin V and of the wealthiest families of Palermo. The new church was built in Renaissance style. However, through the natural course of time, also this building became too small for the liturgical needs of friars and believers. Therefore, in 1630, the Dominicans of Palermo commissioned architect Andrea Cirrincione to build a new church. Ten years after, on 2 February 1640, there was the groundbreaking ceremony.

The essay fights the notion that taking a walk is a matter of the brain needing release and more so conflicted when there is a talkative companion. Summary The main plot of the essay is the challenge of the common notion that taking a walk is a productive activity useful for the brain, Beerbohm makes the case that taking a walk, on the contrary prevents the mind from intelligent thought. Beerbohm's reasoning is that while walking, you almost lose a part of your train of thought, as you are unconsciously thinking about walking. Beerbohm that in London the loud noises of the city save him from the need to make up excuses when someone asks him out for a walk, but the solace of the country can cause a ‚Äúwalk monger‚Äù to insist on talking a walk. Not having an excuse to not take a walk cause Beerbohm to veer from the comfort of a reading chair, which is a disruption that he finds is not progressive. He claims even the most intelligent writers lose train of thought soon as they start walking and conversations eventually lead to dull topics and gossip. Beerbohm concludes the esaay by claiming that he does not believe that physical exercise is bad for you ‚Äútaken moderately, it is rather good for one, physically‚Äù. but condemns taking a walk that lacks reason and would rather take another form of transportation. Themes Beerbohm infers that this is because the soul and the brain clash, the soul makes quick command to walk, the brain questions the idea were you are going as you take a walk. The soul as no answer to the destination causing the brain not to want to take part while a person takes a walk. The lack of brainpower creates dull and unintelligent conversations while making the journey of taking a walk with someone. You cannot just say give the simple answer of no when differing from the question of taking a walk unless they're an old friend, but when it comes down to an acquaintance you must come up with a believable excuse why not to do so. Reception During the 1920s, when this essay was published there was a rise in economic growth, and strong support for a conservative economic system. Most artists objected to this new sense of political wealth and business society ‚ÄúThese artists had little faith in the political leaders who came to power after the war. They felt a need to protest the way the world was changing around them.‚Äù Beerbohm was brutally honest as a writer and believed that if you imposed being unlikeable, people will like you based on honesty and similarities to the ‚Äúcommon man‚Äù. Unlikeable details show honesty in writing, and people relate as long as it doesn't ‚Äúalienate the reader‚Äù. Beerbohm accomplished this balance so perfectly that it seems deliberate, as though he carefully constructed a character with exactly the right kind of flaws: the curmudgeon.

She is a Democrat. The district included the neighborhoods of the Lower East Side, East Village, Little Italy, Chinatown, SoHo, TriBeCa, the Financial District, Battery Park and Governor's Island in Manhattan. In 2016, Cancel was defeated in the Democratic primary for her seat by Yuh-Line Niou. Life and career Born in Puerto Rico, Cancel was raised in the South Bronx and on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She has long been active in Democratic politics, serving as a District Leader in her community for over twenty-five years. Prior to election to the Assembly, Cancel worked in the New York Senate as well as for New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer. Cancel is married to John Quinn, who is a longtime labor leader in New York City. New York Assembly Former Speaker Sheldon Silver was found guilty of corruption in 2015 and was forced to relinquish the seat he held in the New York Assembly for nearly forty years, opening up the seat for a special election. As a result, the Manhattan Democratic party and local district leaders were provided with the opportunity to select the Democratic candidate to run in the April 19, 2016 special election. Numerous candidates stepped up to seek the nomination for the safely Democratic 65th Assembly District, including Cancel, in what proved to be a very contentious process. Amid controversy, the leaders ultimately chose Cancel, who some had accused of being hand-picked by Silver and his supporters to replace him despite being underfunded compared to her competitors. In the election, Cancel faced Republican Lester Chang, Green Party candidate Dennis Levy and Working Families Party candidate Yuh-Line Niou, who had outraised Cancel overwhelmingly and was seen as a candidate who could make the race close. Cancel was out spent 100 to one and her opponents received more political endorsements than Cancel did. In surprisingly closely watched race, Cancel ultimately won the election with 41% of the vote, besting Niou by 1,034 votes, with Chang and Levy together taking 23%. Cancel was sworn into office on May 10, 2016. She ran again in the 2016 primary election to retain her seat for a full, two-year term but was defeated by Niou. Cancel remained a candidate in the general election on the Womens Equality Party Line, but lost again to Niou in the November 8 general election.

She went by the pseudonyms of Marina Clemencia, Sister Maria do C√™u, Sor Maria do Ceo del Cielo and Maria del Cielo. (11 September 1658 ‚Äì 28 May 1753). Born in Lisbon, Portugal. Her work was written during the Baroque era, which is the period of artistic style that uses exaggerated motion and clear interpreted detail to produce work. This period started around 1600 and quickly spread throughout Europe. She has been compared to the prominent authors from the Iberian peninsulas including Giambassita Marino, a Neapolitan Poet, and another writer and nun Juana In√©s de la Cruz. Comparatively Juana was a self- taught scholar and poet of the Baroque school. Her reasoning for becoming a nun was so she could continued her studies more freely. Personal life Maria was born in Lisbon, Portugal, the daughter of nobility to Ant√≥nio de E√ßa de Castro and Catarina de T√°vora. Her Sisters were Francisca Benta de T√°vora and Isabel de Silva, both sisters‚Äô married high-ranking military officials. Like Maria, Isabel was a poet, the author of such works like Com√©dia de Santa Iria, Estrela Errante, Noites de Sol or Obras de Miseric√≥rdia. At the age of eighteen, Maria entered the Franciscan convent of Nossa Senhora de Piedade de Esperan√ßa in Lisbon, in June 1676. Maria served many roles while in the convent. These roles included the function of porter, mistress of novices, and twice as office of prioress. Literary work In service, the Sister Maria do C√©u reflected and used all the basic tendencies of literary-aesthetic in baroque. The Lisbon literary writer includes both religious compositions and works of secular character in the novel allegorical poems and collections of poem and parables. In 1681, Maria do Ceo wrote the first novel allegorical Escarmentos de flores, while the original English version, officially the next track this type of A Preciosa was established in 1690. Later works were printed in Lisbon under the religious name ( Maria do Ceo) or pseudonym (Marina Clemencia) author. In the 1740s, two volumes of her works were published in Madrid, where she had become quite popular. For the most outstanding work by Maria do Ceo recognized by modern literary historians, include A Preciosa. This work was written in prose and verse, a two part allegorical novel issued with a manuscript in the early 1690s. Some motifs from A Preciosa include the books of the Bible, as well as Greek and Roman mythology, the novel also has references to classical philosophy and scholastic, romantic court, and novel pastoral. For the nuns the allegorical song Aves ilsutradas, which is a collection of examples constructed from the avian debate. This work is considered one of the best examples of Portuguese literature and fairy tales with animals included in its didactic function. Maria do Ceo started signing as Sor Maria del Cielo due to her key personalities associated with the royal court, including Teresa de Moncada u Beanavides, Duchess of Medinaceli and her daughter.

It is one of three near-identical portraits of Elizabeth I by Gower that represent the queen holding a symbolic sieve. It was acquired by George Arthur Plimpton in 1930, hence the name. His son, Francis T. P. Plimpton, willed it to the Folger. Iconographic description Three-quarter length portrait of Queen Elizabeth I holding a sieve, with a globe in the left background and the royal coat of arms on the right. The sieve represents her self-identification as the \\"Virgin Queen\\" by association with Tuccia, the Roman Vestal Virgin who proved her virginity by carrying water in a sieve. Inscriptions The painting has three areas of text in yellow uppercase letters: * \\"TVTTO VEDO & MOLTO MANCHA\\" at upper left, on two lines, with the last two letters joined; Italian for \\"I see everything and much is lacking.\\" * \\"E R\\" at upper right, with a gap between the letters; abbreviation for the Latin \\"Elizabeth Regina\\" meaning \\"Elizabeth the Queen.\\" * \\"STANCHO RIPOSO & RIPOSATO AFFANO 1579\\" near the upper right, on three lines, with the second and third letters superimposed to form one character; a line from Petrach's Trionfo D'Amore, IV, 1.145, followed by the year the painting was executed; Italian for \\"Weary, I have rested, and having rested, am breathless.\\" Other versions There are at least two other versions of Gower's Sieve Portrait.

Since the nation's official debut in 1936, Liechtensteinian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, except for two occasions. Liechtenstein did not register any athletes at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and eventually joined the United States-led boycott when Moscow hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics. The 2016 delegation included two swimmers, Christoph Meier and Julia Hassler, and tennis player Stephanie Vogt. Two of the athletes debuted in the 2012 Summer Olympics, with long-distance freestyle swimmer Julia Hassler leading the squad as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Liechtenstein has yet to win a Summer Olympic medal.  Background  Liechtenstein participated in seventeen Summer Olympic Games between its debut in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of Liechtensteiners participating at any one Summer Games was 12 in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. No Liechtensteiner has ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics. However, Liechtenstein has won nine medals at the Winter Olympic Games. All of the Liechtensteiner participants competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics through invitations by FINA or the ITF. Hassler was chosen to be Liechtenstein's flag bearer during the Parade of Nations of the opening ceremony while Meier bore the flag during the closing ceremony. Swimming Liechtenstein received a universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics. Christoph Meier made his Olympic debut by competing in the men's 400 m individual medley event while Julia Hassler made her second appearance, with the first being in London 2012. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, she was one of three athletes to compete for Liechtenstein. She swam the 400 and 800 freestyles, finishing twenty-seventh in the 400 and 17th in the 800. Meier finished eighth in his heat and twenty-second overall with a time of 4:19.19 seconds, which set a national record but did not qualify him for the finals. Hassler started in the second lane. She came second in her heat and twenty- first overall with a time of 8:38.19 seconds. Hassler was eight seconds off the slowest qualifying time of 8:25.55 seconds by Mireia Belmonte of Spain. {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font- size:95%\\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank -align=center align=leftChristoph Meier align=leftMen's 400 m individual medley 4:19.19 22 colspan=2Did not advance -align=center align=leftJulia Hassler align=leftWomen's 800 m freestyle 8:38.19 21 colspan=2Did not advance } 2015 Wimbledon Qualifying Tournament at the Bank of England Sports Grounds in Roehampton, England.

Vehicular Parking Ltd.United States v. Vehicular Parking Ltd., 54 F. Supp. 828 (D. Del. 1944); modified, 56 F. Supp. 297 (D. Del. 1944); further modified, 61 F. Supp. 656 (D. Del. 1945). is a patent‚Äìantitrust case in which the United States Government eroded the doctrine of United States v. General Electric Co.. permitting patentees to fix licensee prices, but failed to persuade the court to decree royalty-free licensing as a remedy. Background Patent illustration from pool patent on coin controlled timing mechanism Defendants Parkrite Corp. and Dual Parking Meter Co. owned patents on parking meters and they manufactured and sold them. In 1936 defendant Joynt wrote to defendants Taylor and Symington proposing the formation of a patent pool: > The parking meter business is new and seems to offer ample opportunity for > profit. From my study of the Patent aspects it seems that very little has > been done to create a Patent monopoly. It is my opinion that a fair start > toward such a monopoly could be gained by pooling the Patents and Patent > Applications of Dual Parking Meter Company and Parkrite Corporation.54 F. > Supp. at 830‚Äì31. Joynt did further research and wrote Taylor and Symington again: > The [Doyle patent] owned by Parkrite Corporation is the only Patent in this > field that seems to have claims which in any way might be construed as > broadly covering a parking meter of the honor system type. These claims are > not such, however, as should be put into litigation because I am afraid they > might be invalidated by certain prior art. At present they are accorded a > prima facie validity which could be used to advantage in discouraging > competition. The actual strength of the Patent Monopoly must be gotten from > a number of Patents covering individual types of parking meters. If the > [Doyle] patent were pooled with the other patents owned by Parkrite > Corporation and the several Patents and Patent Applications owned by Dual > Parking Meter Company, I feel that this pooling would result in a first rate > step toward establishing a dominant position in the parking meter field.54 > F. Supp. at 831. In 1937 Vehicular Parking, Ltd. was formed to hold patents. It acquired Parkrite's patents and then Parkrite was absorbed. Vehicular tried to get M.H. Rhodes. Inc., a price‚Äìcutter, to join the pool but was unsuccessful. Vehicular then sued Rhodes for patent infringement. Rhodes finally agreed to join, but objected to following the price stabilization program until the rest of the industry joined the combination. Vehicular was unsuccessful in persuading Dual, which owned the key Doyle patent, to join. Vehicular sued Dual for patent infringement but Dual countered with its own patent infringement suit and alleged that Vehicular had conspired with other manufacturers to create an unlawful monopoly in the parking meter industry and to fix prices. Vehicular managed to gain control of Dual and arranged to have Dual's patents assigned to Vehicular, and for Vehicular to sign the resale price maintenance agreement. The rest of the industry then joined the combin.54 F. Supp. at 832‚Äì33. Defendant manufacturers Vehicular, Rhodes, Dual, Duncan, Mico, Karpark and Standard agreed to some 21 restrictions, including: * \\"Manual\\" meters would not be sold below $35 and \\"automatic\\" meters not below $45. * \\"Reasonable\\" prices would be charged for parts and services. * A 2¬Ω% discount would be maximum. 5% interest per annum would be charged on all deferred payments. * No free service or maintenance. Guarantees against defective workmanship to be limited to one year. * No deliveries in anticipation of price advances. * Used and reconditioned manual meters not to be sold below $25, such automatic meters not below $35. * Maximum of $15 for trade-in allowance on second-hand meters. * Violations of agreement subject to fines. * Vehicular to enforce patents held by it against other manufacturers of parking meters. * Corporate defendants to pay Vehicular 4% of the sales price of each meter in order to police the industry.54 F. Supp. at 833. Counsel warned of antitrust risks: > The admitted object of licensor and licensees is to control the industry > among themselves, all of it if possible, and if not all then at least most > of it. Prices are fixed for everything, even for services and even for > standards, whether patented or not. Limitations are fixed as to amount of > bond and the bonding period. Minimum prices are even fixed for second-hand > meters which, under the law, are absolutely clear of patent monopoly once > sold. The agreement runs until the expiration of the last patent in the > list. It is not even necessary to consider the future to perceive that > within a month the agreement will apply to anything made under the 1923 > patent and will successively apply to articles made under the succeeding > patents, even after the patents expire and their entire subject matter is > free to the public.54 F. Supp. at 834. Nonetheless, during 1940 and 1941 defendants met, discussed who should and who should not join their group, agreed from time to time to lower or increase prices, and varied their joint terms and conditions of sale. District court ruling The United States sued Vehicular, other members of the pool, and various individual participants in the conduct involved here,The corporate defendants were Vehicular Parking, Ltd., The Karpark Corporation, Peerless Oil & Gas Company, M.H. Rhodes, Inc., Dual Parking Meter Company, Duncan Meter Company, Mico Meter Company, The Parkrite Corporation, and The Standard Meter Corporation. 54 F. Supp. at 830 n.1. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The government alleged that the defendants \\"entered into a combination and conspiracy to restrain and monopolize trade with respect to (1) manufacture, distribution and sale of parking meters and (2) United States letters patent relating to such parking meters.\\"54 F. Supp. at 830. The case was tried before Judge Paul Conway Leahy. The district court observed that the defendants' acts, \\"considered in the light of the fact that defendants controlled 95% to 98% of the parking meter business in the United States, disclose an integrated plan to control the manufacture and sale of parking meters.\\" Moreover, even assuming that all of: > Vehicular's patents are valid, the agreements in suit attempt to extend the > lawful patent monopoly in an illegal manner. Defendants cannot by concert of > action fix prices for the adjunctive devices obviously not within the claims > of the patents, i.e., the coin counters, the standards and collars. . . . > When Vehicular attempts to control the making and vending of products other > than the patented meter, such control is obviously not bottomed on the > patent statute and is far beyond the claims upon which the lawful monopoly > rests. Restrictions on price for servicing meters, and prohibition against > free servicing are not protected by any of the claims found in Vehicular's > collection of patents; such restrictions are illegal.54 F. Supp. at 836. The court said this combination was indistinguishable from that held illegal in Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States. However, in United States v. General Electric Co. the Court held that one manufacturer of a patented product could license another manufacturer to make the patented product at a specified price. The defendants rely \\"if not wholly at least substantially, on this case.\\" But, the court countered, the instant case is sharply distinguishable from the 1926 General Electric case: \\"General Electric was engaged in the manufacture of its patented device; and to protect its legal monopoly the Supreme Court held that it had the right to insist that its licensee would not undersell it in competition.\\"54 F. Supp. at 837-38. Chief Justice Taft said in that case: > When the patentee licenses another to make and vend and retains the right to > continue to make and vend on his own account, the price at which his > licensee will sell will necessarily affect the price at which he can sell > his own patented goods. It would seem entirely reasonable that he should say > to the licensee, \\"Yes, you may make and sell articles under my patent but > not so as to destroy the profit that I wish to obtain by making them and > se‚Äòlling them myself.\\"54 F. Supp. at 838. But nothing in that case says \\"that the patentee can agree with group- licensees to fix the price at which all may sell.\\" Vehicular is the patent owner nut not a manufacturer. \\"The price fixing, then, is for the benefit of the licensees‚Äînot to protect Vehicular's sales of meters because Vehicular is not engaged in manufacturing and sale.\\" This case is a very different one: > Where the defendant corporations control from 95% to 98% of an industry, > with threat of competition removed, upon agreement that others will be > refused \\"to join the fold\\", a tight monopoly exists, especially where the > parties to the agreement before they became parties to it were in free and > open competition and sold the devices at prices to the public much below > those established by the agreement. . . . [W]here the aggregation submit to > rules (and fines for the violation of such rules) to prevent competition > inter sese and from outsiders, agree who should become members of the family > and who should never be adopted, the product and services each should > traffic in, the prices and terms and conditions of sale of such, and the > compensation each shall pay to persons to attempt to sell the product, then > such a business manifestly \\"takes away the freedom of action of [its] > members.\\" For, in such situations, \\"the combination is in reality an extra- > governmental agency, which prescribes rules for the regulation and restraint > of interstate commerce, and provides extra-judicial tribunals for > determination and punishment of violations, and thus 'trenches upon the > power of the national legislature and violates the statute.'\\" [quoting > Fashion Originators Guild v. FTC]. 54 F. Supp. at 838‚Äì39. Patent pools are not objectionable as such, the court said. but they are when \\"the design of persons in such acquisition and pooling is to restrain trade.\\" The court then quoted the letter from Joynt to Taylor and Symington (see Background section, above) in which Joynt proposed forming a patent pool to gain a monopoly. The court pointed next to the agreement with Standard to eliminate the manufacture and sale of \\"free-time\\" meters, citing cases holding it illegal for a patentee to use \\"the lawful monopoly granted by the patent as a means of suppressing the manufacture and sale of competing unpatented articles\\" because the purpose is \\"to extend the bounds of its lawful monopoly to make, use and vend the patented device to the extent where such device would be the only one available to a user of such an article.\\"54 F. Supp. at 839‚Äì40. The court then turned to what remedy was appropriate. The government argued that \\"the only way effectually to dissolve the monopoly is to remove the source of the monopoly power, viz., enjoin defendants from instituting patent infringement suits and to compel the patent-owning defendants to give all applicants royalty‚Äìfree and unrestricted licenses.\\" The court said it would put that issue off for a future hearing because: > [A]t this time, I am not certain the patents in suit should, as a practical > matter, be virtually cancelled by the inclusion in the proposed decree of > the provisions commanding royalty-free licensing. I have no doubt that there > may be judicial death-sentence of a patent in a proper case, but I must be > convinced that this is the case.54 F. Supp. at 841. Further proceedings in district court ‚óè Several months later the district court held a further hearing on relief. First, the court ruled over the defendants' opposition that the injunction against continued violation should extend to the individual defendants, \\"in view of the fact that they were real forces in the combination and not merely employees carrying out corporate policies\\"56 F. Supp. at 297. Conclusion of Law No. 19 had recited: \\"The defendants have effectuated a conspiracy to obtain and use patents and patent rights in violation of the Sherman Act and therefore should be enjoined from enforcing those patent rights, whether by suits for infringement or suits to collect royalties.\\" Defendants moved to strike this conclusion and the corresponding paragraph of the proposed decree, which permanently enjoined the conduct. The court said the defendants are free to petition the court at any time in the future to argue that the effects of the abuse of the patents have been fully dissipated so as to reinstate patent enforceability. But that does not mean, the court added, that defendants' \\"mere declarations that they will carry the decree into effect\\" will suffice: > Exculpation in these cases consists of a change in the method of doing > business. When and if defendants are able to show a course of conduct which > is free from the present taint of illegality, then consideration will be > given to [reinstate patent enforceability].56 F. Supp. at 297-98. Finally, the court agreed with the defendants not to require reasonable- royalty or royalty-free licensing. The issue is pending in the Supreme in Hartford Empire Co. v. United States, the court said, and therefore consideration of the matter \\"will be postponed until after the Supreme Court speaks.\\" 56 F. Supp. at 298. ‚óè A year later Vehicular moved for modification of the final decree. Once again, removal of the injunction against individual defendants was sought. The court said nothing had changed in the interim to justify a modification of this provision.61 F. Supp. at 657. The Supreme Court had now decided Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States,. and the government now argued that the court has power to require royalty-free licensing. The district court disagreed; it said that would be tantamount to cancelling the patent but there is no express statutory or judicial authority for such antitrust relief. Instead, the court ordered mandatory, reasonable-royalty licensing.61 F. Supp. at 657-58. Finally, the defendants claimed they should once again be permitted to enforce their patents. The court said: > A year has passed. There has been no disclosure or report (either to this > court or the Department of Justice) of the defendants' present or future > methods of doing business or the manner in which they are utilizing their > parking-meter patent rights. It is now concluded that an additional passage > of time must occur for it to appear that defendants have exculpated > themselves from their former violations of the anti-trust laws. Such report > may come in the future; but until then the specific sanctions imposed . . . > must stand.61 F. Supp. at 658.

On Sunday, 31 January Tair Kaminer was reverted to training military centre in Tel-Hashomer. Feed back According to the Independent News, the goal of Tair Kaminer for refusal is the reformation of laws punishing conscientious objectors, but she has been known as a traitor. The ordered demonstrations have been held out of her prison and the training bases for soldiers by objectors. The Green Party MP stated to Brighton Pavilion : ‚ÄúWith tensions high in Israel, this is a particularly difficult time to be a conscientious objector ‚Ä¶ (we call) on the Government to request the Israeli authorities to accept the conscientious objection of Israeli citizens who do not wish to bear arms against a civilian population under military occupation.‚Äù when this statement was mentioned at the Houses of Parliament,Amnesty International Israel controverted it. Some parties confirmed this statement like Labour, Scottish National Party, the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru for the legal impunity for demurrer of Israeli's military service such as Tair Kaminer.

It is a foliar pest of members of the Cucurbitaceae, particularly the pumpkin. Description The adult Raphidopalpa foveicollis measures in length and about in breadth. The colour of the elytra varies from pale orange-yellow to bright orange-red to medium brown, and the abdomen is black with soft white hairs. The grubs are found in the soil and are slender and creamy-yellow, with pale brown heads and prothorax. Distribution R. foveicollis has a wide distribution across southern Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa. It is a serious pest of cucurbit crops in northwestern India. Life cycle In northern India, the beetles hibernate over winter, emerging in March. After mating the female lays batches of about eight eggs in the soil. The eggs are orange and oval and hatch in one to two weeks. The grubs at first feed on leaf debris, roots and parts of the host plant in contact with the soil. They pass through four moults as they grow, and pupate in earthen chambers just below the surface of the soil. After a further week to two and a half weeks, the adult beetles emerge, climb the host plant and start feeding. The females start laying eggs within a week or so. There may be five generations over the course of the summer. Biology The beetles are most destructive in March and April while the plants are small. They feed on the leaves, buds and flowers and can defoliate the plants; the grubs bore into the roots and damage the stems and fruits that lie on the soil. R. foveicollis favours pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) over other curcurbit crops, but will also feed on squash (Cucurbita pepo), muskmelon (Cucumis melo), cucumber (Cucurbita sativus), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and the sponge gourd (Luffa aegyptiaca). There are extrafloral nectaries on the sponge gourd which attract ants. The dominant species of ant in India and much of southeastern Asia is Camponotus compressus, and the presence of ants on the crop plant has a deterrent effect on R. foveicollis.

She lived during the period of ecclesiastical reform that arose from the Council of Trent. She is known for being a prolific author, having published Brief Discourse on What Occurred to the Most Reverend Sisters of the Joined Convents of San Mattia and San Luca from the year 1573 (1575) and The Arrival and the Miraculous Workings of the Glorious Image of the Virgin Painted by Saint Luke (1617), and for having been involved in other literary works of her time.  Early life  Diodata Malvasia was born sometime in the early 1530s to Count Annibale Malvasia and Giulia Alamandini, making her from noble lineage and from families well represented in the Bolognese senate.Fantuzzi, Giovanni (1781-1794). Notizi degli scrittori bolognesi. 9 vols. in 4. Bologna: San Tommaso d‚ÄôAquino. Reprint (1965), 9 vols. in 4, Bologna: A. Forni as cited in Callegari, Danielle and McHugh, Shannon (2015), ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 4. Little else is known about her before she professed and became a nun. = San Mattia = Malvasia professed at San Mattia in 1547, as it was common for noble families to place daughters in convents.Leonard, Amy (2005). Nails in the Wall. University of Chicago Press. pp. 12-13. She served as subprioress, an official position below that of prioress, of the convent of San Mattia at the time that she signed the dedicatory of her first known work: Brief Discourse on What Occurred to the Most Reverend Sisters of the Joined Convents of San Mattia and San Luca from the year 1573. She would serve as prioress at San Mattia in 1592, 1606, 1611, and 1613 as well.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 3. = San Luca = San Luca was the sister convent of San Mattia, namesake and home to the Madonna of San Luca, the miraculous icon brought to Bologna in the late twelfth century, the subject of Malvasia‚Äôs second piece of work, The Arrival and the Miraculous Workings of the Glorious Image of the Virgin Painted by Saint Luke. During the period following the Council of Trent there was a large movement to dissolve convents across Europe, and both San Mattia and San Luca were threatened with this fate. This threat is what prompted Malvasia to create Brief Discourse, collecting letters from the sisters of San Mattia advocating to protect San Luca from being closed and to allow them to keep the Miraculous Madonna.Malvasia, Diodata. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Translated by Danielle Callegari and Shannon McHugh (2015). Toronto, Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 50. While Malvasia was writing on what was done to keep convents alive during Tridentine reforms, San Luca took up many boarders following the period of the Council of Trent. Part of the Reformation brought on by the Council of Trent was also a movement for more education, and for both sexes. However, a place to teach girls separate from boys was needed, and here the convents stepped in, finding a way to keep themselves useful to society and to remain open.Leonard, Amy (2005). Nails in the Wall. University of Chicago Press. p. 90. These boarders likely would eventually carry on the tradition of San Luca and San Mattia, and are certainly part of the audience who Malvasia wrote her works for.  Works  Malvasia is one of only a few of published women in the post-Tridentine era. While some former nuns joined the pamphlet propaganda against convents defending their decisions,Leonard, Amy (2005). Nails in the Wall. University of Chicago Press. p. 4. Malvasia instead presents the perspective of a woman who chose to remain within the convent and who worked with her sisters to keep their way of life. Her first piece was entitled A Brief Discourse on What Occurred to the Most Reverend Sisters of the Joined Convents of San Mattia and San Luca from the year 1573. It is a chronicle that recounts the campaign Malvasia waged with her sisters against the enactment of proposed ecclesiastical reform that arose in the period following the Council of Trent: in this case, forced enclosure and seizure of their preternatural Marian icon.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 1. In A Brief Discourse Malvasia gives commentary and provides letters written by nuns to many illustrious officials, including Lord Filippo Guastavillani, and the Pope himself, Pope Gregory XIII.Malvasia, Diodata. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Translated by Danielle Callegari and Shannon McHugh (2015). Toronto, Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 35. Her introduction to the piece claims that she is writing this and bringing these letters together not only as a historical document, but as a way to instruct nuns in the future should they ever face tribulations, as she states: > ‚ÄúAnd so that this truth might appear even more clearly, I resolve to put > down on paper in readable form all of our actions: not for you, who were > present, but for you who will come after us, so that they might see clearly > and touch with their hands our travails and our blessings, and the manner in > which we helped ourselves.‚ÄùMalvasia, Diodata. Writings on the Sisters of San > Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Translated by Danielle Callegari and > Shannon McHugh (2015). Toronto, Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 33-34. The Madonna of San Luca, subject of The Arrival The Arrival and the Miraculous Workings of the Glorious Image of the Virgin Painted by Saint Luke: relates the miracles performed by the Madonna of San Luca, a painting attributed to the Evangelist and held in custodianship by the nuns of Malvasia‚Äôs convent. Published in 1617, this work is what made Malvasia join a tradition of religious women who had played a role in Italy‚Äôs literary canon.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 18. In The Arrival Malvasia does not hesitate to directly link her sisters‚Äô own history with that of the Madonna, which can be seen as a way for her to relate the modern day struggles of nuns to the hardships faced by figures in legends and myths of the church.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 22. There were many copies of The Arrival found in Italy, which suggests that her published work had a fairly impressive print run and might well have enjoyed a substantial circulation.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 27. Within The Arrival there are also examples of Malvasia‚Äôs poetry, most of which is Marian verse - verse that exemplified Mary's role and held her up as dignifying womankind - as was common for female poets of this time. Malvasia is also thought to be involved in the 1579 reprint and expansion of the most famous history of the Madonna of San Luca, L‚Äôhistoria della Madonna San Luca, composed by Leandro Alberti.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 28. Published under the title Cronichetta, there is a substantial addition from an unidentified ‚Äúmost reverend religious‚Äù. It is thought that this anonymous author may be Malvasia herself.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 29. There is also a new dedicatory letter, signed by the prioress and sisters of San Mattia and San Luca. Malvasia may also have been involved in a poetic anthology by the intellectual Ascanip Persio which included Malvasia‚Äôs contemporary women writers Chiara Matraini and Lucrezia Marinella.Callegari, Danielle; McHugh, Shannon (2015). ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna. Ontario: Iter Academic Press. p. 2. It seems like Malvasia found her way into these projects in an effort to engage them or even reappropriate them for her own purposes in her continued defense of the sisters of San Mattia and San Luca. In the second edition of Santi Riccetelli‚Äôs Chronicle of all that Occurred Regarding the Gloriou Madonna of San Luca of the Monte della Guardia (1574), Malvasia appears again as the text is preceded by a dedicatory letter signed by the sisters of San Mattia and San Luca.

She was the daughter of Margaret Fell and Thomas Fell, and the eventual stepdaughter of George Fox.  Personal  Swarthmore Hall Sarah Fell or Sarah Meade was born in 1642 in Lancaster, England in Swarthmore Hall. She was the fourth daughter of Judge Thomas Fell and Margaret Fell, who was also known as the \\"Mother of Quakerism.\\" She was subsequently the stepdaughter of George Fox, whom Margaret Fell remarried after Thomas Fell's death in 1658. She was the sister of Margaret Rous, Bridget Fell, George Fell, Isabel Yeamans, Mary Lower, Susannah Ingram, and Rachel Abraham. She married William Meade in June 1681 and together they had a son, Nathaniel Meade.  Career  Fell worked as a Swarthmore farm accountant and clerk of the Lancashire Women Quarterly Meeting. She wrote the household account book of Swarthmore Hall between 1672‚Äì1678. When the account book was first opened in March 1672, the residents of Swarthmore were Margaret Fell, George Fox, three unmarried daughters (Sarah, Susannah, and Rachel), a recently widowed daughter, Isabel, and Isabel's two children. Fell's account book showed the expenditures for her family and the Swarthmore Minutes (SWMM), which reflected the Quaker philanthropic thoughts and practices. In this century, women were very much involved in their husbands' business affairs; as a result, account books kept by women also had detailed information of their husbands' income. The names of 198 women who had social or business relationships with Fells appeared at least once in her account book during the six years she recorded. One third of that total appeared in the Swarthmore Minutes. Women who were not mentioned in the Minutes were likely silent or poor members of the Meeting. The book also included the death and funeral information of Sarah Fell's niece Rachel Yeamans, who died as a child on 20 June 1676 while visiting Swarthmore Hall. From 1658 to 1681, Sarah invested in iron bloomery with her mother and three sisters, recording the income of iron bloomery in her account book, albeit not completely. Between 1664 and 1668, Sarah took charge of the farm while her mother Margaret was imprisoned in Lancaster Castle. She also founded the town bank and grammar school in Ulverston and helped the poor. She became a banker to her Quaker neighbors and friends, offering financial operations included loans, receipts, and payments.  Charity  In 1676, Sarah loaned money to several of her laborers and servants at the Swarthmore. She was known to be a fair lender, and also gave money to those who could not repay her. People who borrowed from the Fell's family always repaid the debts.  Quakerism  She was involved in the administration part of Swarthmore Hall Quaker Women Quarterly Meeting. She also wrote the epistle directed to Quaker women's meetings everywhere. Her father was not a Quaker, but he allowed her mother and her followers to use Swarthmore Hall for meetings nonetheless.

The lake is jointly owned by the twelve principal villages of north-eastern Corfu and leased for fish farming, producing flathead grey mullet, sea bass and eel. It is also used for duck hunting. The adjacent dunes are home to the sand lily (pancratium maritimum) and the agile frog (rana dalmatina).

It is a concept album featuring seven songs that draw from a diverse range of styles including alternative rock, drone, black metal, progressive rock, post-metal and electronica. The album was recorded, mixed, mastered and produced in September 2015 by Jaime G√≥mez Arellano at Orgone Studios in London, and co-produced by Jorge Mur and the band itself. The album was released by Season of Mist on March 11, 2016, with artwork designed by Ritxi Ost√°riz and Elena Gallen. A different cover was created for each of the different physical formats, all of them presenting a different glitch variation on an original picture by French photographer Mathieu Bernard- Reymond. The release received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its complexity and gloomy sound. A Year With No Summer features the collaboration of Ulver's singer Kristoffer Rygg in the song \\"10th April\\" and Mayhem's Attila Csihar in \\"The Kandinsky Group\\". The digipak and jewelcase editions feature a hidden track that consist of a stripped-down bossanova rendition of the track \\"Darkness\\" by Jr Morgue.  Style  A Year With No Summer is noted for featuring a much different sound approach than the band's debut Mantiis (especially in the vocal field, with a register often compared to that of Genesis' Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins), however retaining its variety and difficult classification. The critics also pointed out the decrement of extreme metal resources such as blast beats and death growls in favor of a more accessible sound. In respect of the wide range of styles and genres displayed in the album, Loudwire wrote that \\"A Year Without Summer will appeal to fans of My Bloody Valentine, Pharmakon and Cult of Luna. Not any of them ‚Äî all three.\\"  Critical reception  A Year With No Summer was met with positive reviews that highlighted its general aura of disenchantment and resignation, its thematic depth, and the bold shift in style from the band's debut, while a few critics found this turn to feel bland and disappointing.

The more scientifically accepted name for agents of this class is a repartitioning agent, not a growth promotor. Ractopamine (brand names include Optaflexx and Paylean) and zilpaterol (brand name Zilmax) received FDA approval in 1999 and 2003, respectively. They are also approved in Mexico, South Africa, and Canada. 160 countries restrict the importation of beef which has been raised with Œ≤-agonists. Temple Grandin was one of the first to describe the potential problems with the supplement. Cattle may arrive at the plant with a stiff gait, acting like they have both stiff muscles and sore feet. The problem could be muscle fatigue. Zilpateral enhances the growth of ‚Äúfast-twitch‚Äù fibers, a type of muscle fiber that fatigues more easily. On August 16, 2013 Merck and Co., the makers of Zilmax, suspended the sale of the product in the US and Canada. But problems may exist with all Œ≤-agonists supplementation, and not just for animals. Introduction The family of Œ≤-agonists includes Œ≤1-, Œ≤2-, and Œ≤3-agonists such as clenbuterol, ractopamine, cimaterol, zilpaterol and salbutamol. They possess similar chemical structures with different substituent groups on the phenylethanolamines. Due to their significant nutrition redistribution function, Œ≤-agonists have been applied in the livestock industry such as pigs and ruminants to reduce carcass fat and increase muscle mass while improving growth rate and feed conversion ratio (Bareille and Faverdin, 1996, Bergen et al., 1989, Byrem et al., 1998, Cardoso and Taveira, 2002, Shook et al., 2009 and Williams et al., 1987). Unfortunately, Œ≤-agonists deposited in animal tissues can cause acute poisoning when consumed by humans, particularly in people with symptoms of muscular tremors, cardiac palpitation, nervousness, headache, muscular pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills (Brambilla et al., 2000). Therefore, the use of Œ≤-agonists in animal feeds has been banned in many countries such as the EU and China (Mitchell and Dunnavan, 1998 and Prezelj et al., 2003). There are still illicit usages of Œ≤-agonists in animal feeds in many countries. Screening Broad screening and identification of Œ≤-agonists in feed and animal body fluid and tissues using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry combined with spectra library search ‚Ä¢ Tingting Lia, 1, ‚Ä¢ Jingjing Caob, 1, ‚Ä¢ Zhen Lib, ‚Ä¢ Xian Wanga, ‚Ä¢ Pingli Hea, Broad screening and identification of Œ≤-agonists in feed, serum, urine, muscle and liver samples was achieved in a quick and highly sensitive manner using ultra high performance liquid chromatography- quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) combined with a spectra library search. Solid-phase extraction technology was employed for sample purification and enrichment. After extraction and purification, the samples were analyzed using a Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer under full-scan and data-dependent MS/MS mode. The acquired mass spectra were compared with an in-house library (compound library and MS/MS mass spectral library) built with TraceFinder Software which contained the M/Z of the precursor ion, chemical formula, retention time, character fragment ions and the entire MS/MS spectra of 32 Œ≤-agonist standards. Screening was achieved by comparing 5 key mass spectral results and positive matches were marked. Using the developed method, the identification results from 10 spiked samples and 238 actual samples indicated that only 2% of acquired mass spectra produced false identities. The method validation results showed that the limit of detection ranged from 0.021‚Äì3.854 Œºg kg‚àí1and 0.015‚Äì1.198 ng mL‚àí1 for solid and liquid samples, respectively.

It is notable as one of the earliest plays to develop a moral thesis as part of a nominally unrelated plot. Redford was best known as a composer of keyboard music, and the play was written to be performed by the children's choir of St. Paul's Cathedral. The play concerns itself with education rather than salvation, stemming from Redford's role as a teacher rather than as a preacher. The character Wit initially sets off with naive enthusiasm to learn by his own initiative, but eventually gains appreciation for the guidance of instruction in a narrative that contains elements of chivalric romance. Elements of the play may also be a reference to Henry VIII's marriage to his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. The play is known from a manuscript in the British Library (Additional 15233), which includes most of the play bound with pages of unrelated organ music. The manuscript omits the beginning few pages of the play, the music for the songs, and the lyrics of the final song. By one estimate, nearly half of the manuscript's pages may be missing. There is no evidence that the play was ever printed, but it inspired two rewrites, one of which was written by Francis Marbury, and the plot was familiar enough that a pastiche of it was included in the play Sir Thomas More.  Synopsis  Wit, having fallen in love with Lady Science, sets off to defeat the monster Tediousness, who is Science's greatest enemy. Wit ignores advice to use the sword of Comfort against Tediousness and is killed, but resurrected by Honest Recreation. Wit is then seduced by Idleness, leading to a comic scene between Idleness and Ignorance. A song performed by Fame, Riches, Favour, and Worship is interrupted by Wit, whom they do not recognize because Idleness and Ignorance have disguised him. This angers Wit until he looks in the mirror of Reason and learns his appearance had been changed, and Reason and Shame whip Wit into shape and reunite him with his colleagues, who use teamwork and the sword of Comfort to defeat Tediousness. Wit and Science then meet and agree to be married.

Marie Elizabeth de LaFite (1737‚Äì1794) was a published author, translated English texts into French, and was a Dutch governess before joining the service of Queen Charlotte of England while her native country went through the French Revolution.  Personal life  She was born in Hamburg on August 21, 1737, to Jean Alexandre Bou√© and Marie-Elisabeth Cottin. She traveled for many years and in 1768 married Jean-Daniel de La Fite (1719-1781), a Huguenot minister from La Haye. They lived in The Hague, a Dutch city created and devoted to government, where Jean-Daniel was minister of the Walloon Church and chaplain to the house of Orange for over a decade. In 1770 she gave birth to a girl, Marguerite Emelie Elise, and in 1773 had a son, Henri Fran√ßois Alexandre. In the same year her son was born, Marie Elizabeth de LaFite began her literary career by translating the German Mlle de Sternheim, by Sophie da La Roche, into French. While this was her first published work, LaFite had previously helped her husband create a scholarly periodical focusing on health and wellness for the poor called Biblioth√®que des Sciences et des Beaux Arts. Her next work came in 1775 when she wrote critiques and essays for a few years before she began producing educational books in 1778, which she is most known for. In 1781 both her father and husband died, leaving her in need of work as she was not a particularly wealthy widow. De Richemond quoted a letter to her sister in which Marie Elizabeth acknowledged her need to work and make a living for herself. She moved to London with her daughter Elise, where she gained employment under Queen Charlotte as a reader and lady-companion to the three eldest princesses. This was not the first time the English monarchy had brought in foreign women authors to join the court. Nearly 20 years before, Jeanne Leprince de Beaumont was invited into the father of King George III‚Äôs inner circle, setting an example for women like LaFite who was invited to London by George‚Äôs wife Charlotte. In London, her most famous work, Questions to be Resolved: or, A New Method of Exercising the Attention of Young People. Interspersed with Various Pieces, Calculated for Instruction and Amusement, first appeared in English in 1790. Just before the end of her life, Marie Elizabeth returned to translating the work of La Roche again and Johann Kaspar Lavater. Marie Elizabeth de LaFite died in London in 1794.  Literary work  Marie Elizabeth organized her book, Questions to be Resolved, in a unique fashion. Instead of writing a novel, she describes scenes between two daughters and their mother in which the daughters display a deep commitment to their mother. In these short stories, the mother also plays the role of educator, a common theme throughout European women‚Äôs history, as she discusses the meaning of virtue, pleasure, history, and other philosophical questions. This makes her book relate towards her intended audience, mothers with daughters, and allows for a style that resembles a textbook rather than a narrative. Marie Elizabeth poses a series of questions following each dialogue or short play in order to reinforce what she is trying to teach readers in the chapters. The ‚ÄúDivisions‚Äù focus directly on the information from the dialogues and serve as a means to enlighten her readers and contain the answers to her questions. Her book is designed to be a teaching tool for young girls, taking noble French ideas about morality and turning them into a reading comprehension workbook. Marie Elizabeth not only produced a book of dialogues for learning, it is also a reflection of the values and society in which she lived. Marie Elizabeth created a story of a stranger who gave money to a wounded American soldier from the American Revolution to help him get back home. Although the soldier promised to pay him back, the man was less concerned with the money than with his ability to give charity and with his honesty. The unidentifiable man in the narrative claimed to have donated because he appeared honest and in need, and he had the means to help him. Early modern aristocrats had to be concerned with their public image and giving charity was a common form of publicity that affected their community. This story is written to highlight the importance of helping the less fortunate and to show that good things often happen to selfless people, as seen by the soldier keeping his promise to pay back the man what he borrowed from him. Then again the soldier's father invited the stranger to share in his family's wealth and possessions because of the kindness that had been shown to his son. In addition to writing about the relationship between those with money and the less fortunate, Marie Elizabeth expands on the mother-daughter dynamics of her day. Mothers were responsible for teaching their daughters the way of the world. However, there are always disagreements between parents and their children. Marie showed these disputes in her book through her creative fictional dialogues. For example, it was expected of daughters to take the advice of their mothers because they had already gone through the trials of womanhood in the early modern period. Like modern families, this is not always practiced in society and Marie Elizabeth argues that struggles make people stronger, but only if they are willing to accept their problems by remaining composed, patient, and confident. These were all traits that young women were expected to display in their daily lives and Marie wrote to continue to pass on this ideology of what makes a proper woman. ‚ÄúThe more at peace one is with one self, the less liable is the mind to be tormented with the turbulent passions of anger, hatred, and revenge. You see, therefore, Paulina, that self-approbation lessens the number of our evils, and softens those it cannot prevent.‚Äù LaFite is known for her letters and books, as well as her translating work. She translated Histoire de la conversion du comte J.F. Sruens√©e, ci-devant minister de S.M., Memoires de Mlle de Sternheim par Mme de La Roche, and Vie et lettres de Gellert, all from German to French. LaFite also translated a few English texts into French such as Pens√©es sur les moeurs des Grands. She wrote \\"Lettres sur divers sujets\\", letters to Rijklof Micha√´l von Goens, Entretiens, drames et contes moraux, destines √† l‚Äô√©ducation de la jeunesse, par Madame de La Fite, and the original French version of Questions to be Resolved. = Today = Researching Marie Elizabeth de LaFite is difficult due to a lack of primary sources. Additionally, the information we do have on her often provides conflicting information. The discrepancies in information include two documents that claims she was born in 1750, a whole 13 years after two other sources. There is a lack of English translations of her works and letters. The majority of her work is kept in The Hague or Amsterdam, while other works and translations are in libraries of Rotterdam and Stockholm. = Bibliography = 45 Books by and About Women, (Los Angeles, CA: Michael Thompson Books), accessed May 1, 2016.

Marchocka's spiritual autobiography is believed to be the first of its kind composed by a woman in Poland. Early life and education Marchocka was born on June 25, 1603 in southern Poland, near Nowy SƒÖcz, which was a heavily Protestant area at the time of her birth. She was born into an aristocratic, politically active family, during the latter half of what some historians claim to be Poland's Golden Age. During this time, the Polish Parliament grew to check the king's power, territories were consolidated, religious diversity was tolerated, and more members of the aristocracy started pursuing university educations. Marchocka was educated at home by her mother, from whom she learned to read and write and also learned some elementary Latin. Marchocka, like most medieval and early modern women, had limited educational opportunities, and was educated in \\"strict adherence to the Catholic faith,\\" using religious texts including Piotr Skarga's Lives of the Saints and the writings of Carmelite nun and Catholic saint Mary Magdalene de‚Äô Pazzi. =Religious career and death= In her autobiography, Marchocka claims that she was called to the religious life at a young age, and as a young girl pledged to God that she would remain chaste. However, she was initially hesitant to take orders out of fear that she was unworthy, and because of concerns she had with the monastic life. Marchocka documented that when she was 12, her older sister entered St. Claire's Convent in Nowy SƒÖcz. She visited the convent with her parents several times and wrote critically of the way the nunnery was run, noting that she was dismayed that the \\"rule of silence was not maintained\\" and that she witnessed various other forms of misbehavior. It was during a visit to St. Claire's that Marchocka was given a copy of Carmelite reformer and Counter-Reformation author Teresa of √Åvila's autobiography and began to learn about the Carmelites. In her religious career, Marchocka was frequently referred to as Teresa of Jesus, after Saint Teresa. According to Polish scholar Liliana Sikorska, aside from their shared name and faith, however, the connection between these women is fairly loose. Marchocka officially entered a Carmelite convent in Krakow at the age of 17. Over the course of her tenure in the convent, she ascended to the rank of prioress, and grew to be admired by her sisters for her saintly lifestyle and her \\"contemplative prayer.\\" She was also seen as a protective spirit in the cloister, and it was believed that her prayers saved Carmelite nuns in Lviv from the Cossacks invasion of April 16, 1649. Marchocka died on April 19, 1652 in Warsaw, Poland. Autobiography Marchocka began writing her autobiography on May 3, 1647. After its release to the public, her story became a symbol for Polish piety during the Counter-Reformation, and was used by her followers to revitalize Polish devotion. According to Marchocka, she began writing after her confessor, Father Ignatius of Saint John the Evangelist, instructed her to write about her life, and therefore confess all of her sins. =Writing style= Marchocka's autobiography is not a neat, chronological timeline of her life. Instead, it is disjointed, fragmented, and merges stories from both her family life and her own spiritual journey. Her language is simple, and she does not clutter her writing with complex rhetorical devices or even excerpts of liturgical texts. Marchocka's autobiography contains several elements typically found in the hagiography of saints, including miraculous events like premonitions and visions of the Virgin Mary. Marchocka wrote that she had the power of clairvoyance and had a premonition of her father's death before it happened. Despite the hagiographical elements of the autobiography, Marchocka wrote in a much different style than that used by the writers of saints‚Äô vitae. Instead of writing in the objective third person voice, as was common in many saints‚Äô vitae, Marchocka wrote her story in her own voice, thus injecting her own emotions into the text. She began her autobiography with descriptions of her family life and stories of events from before she was born. One of these stories described her mother, Elzbieta Modrzejowska, falling out of a carriage while pregnant with Anna Maria. Another story recounted when her mother almost gave birth in church. Marchocka interpreted these events as signs from God that she was destined to live her life devoted to God. Former professor at Yale Divinity School Roland H. Bainton divided Marchocka's autobiography into the five stages of her religious journey. In the first stage, she is alienated from God ‚Äì her soul is suffering, and unable to feel or imagine. The second stage is characterized by bitterness and desperation, but the third stage relieves this suffering, and God is no longer hiding \\"himself in thick darkness.\\" Bainton claims that in the fourth stage, God completely overtakes her, and at last, in the fifth stage, the soul \\"stands naked before God.\\" The final stage is also the point during which her suffering is finally relieved through complete devotion to the church. The following prayer is an excerpt from Marchocka's autobiography, and exemplifies her desire for a life devoted to God: > \\"Oh my Father, Thou knowest, Oh Lord, my desire and I know that neither > thought, nor word, nor imagination can attain. I beseech Thee, Oh merciful > God, grant unto me light and learning that I write not which is not work to > be written. Let me not be subject to passing fancy, nor to the base and > vile, the empty, futile, and worthless. Suffer me not to sink in the slough > of doom. O glorious God! Deliver me to be blessed forever. Humbly I beseech > Thee, my father. Cover me with Thy pinions, enlighten mine eyes that I > wander not in a haze, knowing not what to write nor where. Let me but know > Thee, Oh God.‚Äù =Publication= Father Ignatius of St. John the Evangelist, who was the first person to encourage Marchocka to document her life, created the first manuscript copy of her autobiography two years after her death, in 1654. He titled the work The Life of Sister Teresa of Jesus. His manuscript was later published in Lviv, Ukraine, which at the time belonged to Poland. As with the stories of many saints and religious figures in the middle ages and early modern period, Marchocka's book was circulated around Poland after her death and made her a popular religious role model. Her autobiography was a symbol for Polish piety during the 17th and 18th centuries, and perhaps even gained notoriety comparable to the autobiography of Saint Teresa of Avila. Karol G√≥rski published Marchocka's complete collection of writings in 1939, and gave her autobiography its present title ‚Äì Mystical Autobiography (translated from the Polish Autobiografia mistyczna). Marchocka's original manuscript, Father Ignatius‚Äô first copy, as well as two other handwritten copies, were all destroyed during World War II. In the introduction of his edition of Mystical Autobiography, G√≥rski noted that there were some minor differences between the editions, and attributed those differences to scribes‚Äô efforts to correct Marchocka's spelling and grammar. Marchocka's autobiography, letters, notes and prayers, with the exception of limited excerpts, have never been published in English.

She was raised in the suburb of Moonee Ponds and educated at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School (1902‚Äì06), where one of her teachers was the painter Frederick McCubbin, but she received no formal training in photography. Her professional partner, Dorothy Izard, was also her life partner. In 1950 Hollick and Izard embarked on their first overseas travel, visiting relatives and touring the UK. On their return they moved to Heidelberg. Photography career There is evidence that Hollick was experimenting with photography in a home darkroom by 1907. The following year, she set herself up as a freelance photographer who toured rural areas of the state of Victoria, making portraits of families, especially children. She worked mostly outdoors in natural light with a field camera. By World War I, she had shifted into studio photography, initially working out of her parents' house in Moonee Ponds and later moving into Mina Moore's former studio in the Auditorium Building downtown, subsequently expanding still further into Chartres House. It was in this period that Hollick developed a reputation for skillful use of both natural and studio lighting and for stylish compositions, often setting her subjects against plain backgrounds. She specialized in portraits of society figures and celebrities, as well as fashion photography for use in advertisements. For example, she took several pictures of the American aviator Amy Johnson on her 1930 world tour, including the official Australian portrait. For most of the 1920s, Hollick was one of Melbourne's two leading photographers, along with Pegg Clarke, and she exhibited her work both locally and internationally. During this period she won at least six silver awards and numerous bronze awards in various shows. Her photographs were regularly published in Art in Australia and other Australian magazines. In recent years, her work has been included in at least two large-scale exhibitions of Australian photography. Hollick gave up her downtown studios during the Great Depression and returned to working from Moonee Ponds. She retired from photography in 1950 and died in 1977 at Sandringham.

It consists of a single track which runs for thirty-three minutes and is roughly divided into seven movements. It is also the band's first recording with new drummer Patrice Hamelin, who has been performing with the band live since 2011 but only became an official member in 2014 after the departure of John Longstreth (whose schedule with Origin was incompatible with Gorguts).  Writing and musical style  Pleiades' Dust presents a historical narrative the House of Wisdom, an ancient library that stood in Baghdad from the 9th-13th century. The library contained and protected much of the world's knowledge until it was destroyed by the Mongols in 1258CE. According to lyricist and lead songwriter Luc Lemay, \\"the lyrics of the song start with the fall of Rome around 500 A.D., then go to Baghdad in 762 when they founded the city, then the Mongol invasion in the 1200s, when the library was destroyed.\\" In a separate interview referencing the Islamic Golden Age, Lemay further explained that \\"I talk about knowledge as if it was like a wandering person. So for some reason the knowledge reappeared in the Middle East, and there was a very strong movement of intellect there.\\" \\"It‚Äôs kind of refreshing to remind ourselves where those beautiful things come from. The numbers we use, that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs from. Algebra, that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs from. Of course, we are not waking up in the morning and getting a fix of algebra. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. But we take those things for granted. I think it‚Äôs very interesting and beautiful to discover and understand where those things are from.\\" Though Lemay wrote the majority of the first 20 minutes of the song, every band member contributed their own ideas and details to the songwriting. \\"This is a new thing for me, and I like this better though. It‚Äôs way better than having to stand there in the rehearsing room one-on-one and trying to explain with bad air drumming. Instead I‚Äôm at my studio, really focused, taking my time and saying ‚Äúok, here I hear a fill‚Äù and write it down. I‚Äôm not a drummer, but that‚Äôs a more precise way for me to explain my ideas. Then when I give it to everybody, they have a pretty good idea of what I hear in my head, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs set in stone. Not at all! The point to do that is to say ‚Äúok guys, drum-wise this is what I‚Äôm picturing and this is the best idea up to now.‚Äù But they can feel free to change it if they hear something different.\\" Lemay has cited a number of influences on the writing of Pleiades' Dust. The French avant-garde black metal band Deathspell Omega's EP 'Chaining the Katechon', Meshuggah 'I', and particularly Porcupine Tree's album 'The Incident' all influenced his decision to write such a long song. In an interview with Noisey, Lemay said that \\"the challenge was totally in the song structure, and that‚Äôs where I wanted to put myself into an uncomfortable place. It was the first time I wrote a piece this long, and the number one rule was that I didn‚Äôt want it to sound like three or four songs put together. And I think we did it. You can feel movements happening, but you don‚Äôt feel like each movement is a song by itself. That was important.\\"  Critical reception  Pleiades' Dust was met with very positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic (a review aggregator site which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from music critics), based on 5 critics, the album has received a score of 80/100, which indicates \\"universal acclaim\\". Metalsucks declared the release a \\"total fucking masterpiece\\" and \\"an actually enjoyable, challenging piece of art\\", and rated the album with a perfect score of 5 out of 5. Exclaim! gave the EP a 9 out of 10 rating, calling it \\"a stunning release, a cohesive, exceptionally crafted piece that captures the heavy aggression and incredible musicianship of Gorguts while incorporating more avant-garde elements and a fascinating storyline to boot\\". Revolver rated the album 3.5 out of 5, noting that Gorguts \\"still manage to break barriers\\", their \\"musicianship... is top notch\\", and \\"this EP is by no means a casual listen\\".

Hooftman was one of richest men of his time in the prosperous city of Antwerp, the trading center of the Spanish Netherlands.  Life and work  Gillis Hooftman was the son of Erken (Arnold) Arnt Hauptmann (d. 1545), a bailiff of the Lathof in the Stockem neighborhood of Eupen, and of Tryntgen (Katharina) Hoesch. The family originated from the Rhineland, and its earlier name of Eichelberg was changed to a Limburger form, van Eyckelberg.Gillia Hooftman, Geni.com (login required) A fiefdom in Eupen-Stockem named after Hauptmann, as is the \\"Hauptmann Column\\" was erected to help travelers find their way through the marshlands of the High Fens. The international trade in timber was the key to the success of his trading house. His business contacts reached as far as Russia, and eventually Hooftman was in a position to purchase several trading vessels. Sources state that Hooftman may have owned more than 100 ships at his peak. These ships sailed to ports in the Baltic Sea, and also pioneered Dutch trading with ports of the Arctic Ocean, and North Africa. By 1559, Hooftman had become one of the richest men in Antwerp, and was living on the \\"Steenstraat\\", near the Het Steen fortress. In 1578 he bought the \\"Pulhof\\" quarter in Berchem, and in 1580, he acquired the Van Affinghem Abbey's retreat in the Mattestraat. That same year he also acquired the Cleydael Castle, and became the Landlord of Cleydael and Aartselaar. He became active in local politics, and for many years, he was a member of the Antwerp City Council.

Throughout the 2000s, serving as the head of the legal firm Sipar, Yorov was involved in a number of high-profile legal cases, representing individuals prosecuted by the government of Tajikistan on charges deemed politically motivated. In 2011, he represented prominent religious figure and former senator Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda when the latter sued the head of the state- backed Council of Ulems (Islamic scholars) for defamation. The case occurred amidst a government-led crackdown against the Turajonzoda brothers who frequently criticized the state religion policy. In 2013, Yorov represented Muhiddin Kabiri, the leader of the Islamic Revival Party and member of the country's parliament who had been sued by the Dushanbe Mayor's Office for criticizing the practice of massive cutting of trees in the capital. In 2014, Yorov represented Fakhriddin Zokirov, another Tajik lawyer who had been arrested on forgery charges, apparently as a retaliation for representing Zayd Saidov, a businessman and politician. He also offered to represent Alexander Sodiqov, a Canada-based PhD student who had been detained by the authorities and charged with spying and treason while conducting research in Tajikistan in June 2014. Sodiqov's family declined the offer, fearing that the outspoken lawyer's affiliation with an opposition party might politicize the case.  Arrest and International Reaction  Following the ban on the Islamic Revival Party (IRPT) in Tajikistan, its designation as a terrorist organization, and the detention of some 200 of its members in September 2015, Buzurgmehr Yorov took on representing several high-ranking members of the party who were arrested on a number of charges, including . On September 28, 2015, gave an interview to a local news agency, alleging that one of the arrested IPRT members he represented had been tortured in pretrial detention. He also alleged that the authorities had been planting weapons and IEDs on lower level IRPT members detained throughout the country. Finally, he announced that he had set up a committee for the defense of the arrested IRPT members. Later that day, officers from the Police Unit for Combating Organized Crime (UBOP) arrived in the office of the legal firm Sipar, seized documents related to Yorov's representation of the arrested IRPT members, and took the lawyer away for questioning. On September 29, 2015, Tajikistan's Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) announced that Yorov was detained on charges of swindling and fraud allegedly dating back to 2010. On October 2, 2015, the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about an \\"increasing risk of human rights violations\\" in Tajikistan connected to the legal prosecution of IRPT members and the lawyers who represented them. The committee for the defense of the arrested IRPT members that Yorov had set up disbanded soon after his detention. Sipar, the legal firm that Yorov had headed, also disbanded. On October 7, six human rights groups (including Amnesty International, the Paris Bar, Association for Human Rights in Central Asia, Human Rights Watch, the International Partnership for Human Rights (IPHR), and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee) issued a statement demanding that the authorities in Tajikistan release Yorov or present \\"internationally recognizable charges\\" against him. The statement also alleged that the lawyer had been detained on \\"trumped-up\\" charges and as a punishment for providing legal counsel to the arrested IRPT members. Facing a wave of international condemnation and media interest in the case, the authorities classified Yorov's case as \\"top secret\\" on October 14. A number of other human rights groups and bar associations around the world condemned the detention of Buzurgmehr Yorov, including the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC), UK-based Law Society, and the Netherlands- based Lawyers for Lawyers (L4L). In December 2015, authorities added three new charges against Buzurgmehr Yorov, including creating an extremist group, public propagation of extremist ideas, and inciting national, racial, or religious hostility. Each of these charges carries a sentence of three to eight years in prison. The lawyer's relatives who were allowed to visit him in detention said he had denied all charges brought against him.  Trial  On May 3, 2016, the trial against Yorov and another lawyer, Nuriddin Makhkamov, opened in Dushanbe's Ferdowsi District Court. The trial was closed to the public, and journalists as well as representatives of diplomatic missions and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) were not allowed to attend. According to a local news agency which spoke to several individuals who had attended the trial, Yorov refused the services of his state-appointed lawyer, suggesting that the latter had not been given sufficient time to prepare for trial. Yorov also reportedly requested that the presiding judge be disqualified and a new judge be appointed. Finally, he announced that several key testimonies that he and supporting witnesses had made during the course of the investigation were missing from court materials. Local journalists and representatives from the US Embassy in Dushanbe and OSCE were allowed to attend the second session of the trial against Yorov and Makhkamov on May 10. During the session, Yorov requested that the trial be held in a local theater or aired live on national television, alluding apparently to what he believed was a farcical nature of the trial. During the third session of the trial, on May 13, Yorov requested that all the 18 persons who testified against him appeared on trial.

All of these phenomena can be generalised by a few theoretical results that qualitatively describe these non-equilibrium steady states. A common example of this is the derivation of the force exerted by a non-equilibrium system on two embedded walls. It is characteristic of a narrow, unimodal spectrum for the force to be dependent on the width and peak within a fluctuation spectrum, which oscillates between repulsion and attraction. Some common generalisations of this theory can be applied to the Maritime Casimir Effect and through the motion of active Brownian particles within a closed system. Examples of active non-equilibrium systems can be demonstrated through many chemical, physical and biological processes; which range from turbulence, mechanical driving, chemical bonding, chemical gradients and cosmic background radiation.

Gameplay ChromaGun is a puzzle game revolving around using colors. The player uses the ChromaGun, a paint-shooting weapon, to colorize walls and floating spherical robots, called Worker Droids. These Worker Droids are attracted to walls of the same color and will move towards them. The player's objective is to solve puzzles by cleverly rearranging Worker Droids, changing their colors, and guiding them to door-opening triggers, switches or electrified tiles. The player can shoot paint in the primary colors red, blue and yellow using the ChromaGun. The primary colors can be mixed together on walls and Worker Droids to create the secondary colors green, purple and orange. Mixing more than two different colors will result in black, which Worker Droids are not attracted to. The game consists of many short puzzle levels to solve, however a single mistake can render a puzzle unsolvable, forcing to restart the level. There are 26 levels in total, each with only one solution. Reception On Metacritic, the Nintendo Switch version has a score of 69/100 based on 14 reviews, and the PlayStation 4 version has a score of 74/100 based on 10 reviews. indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Twinfinite's Chaz Miller scored it 3.5/5, praising the game's art direction, difficulty and concept, but stated that the puzzles could get \\"frustrating\\" or \\"repetitive\\" in portions, and had no alternative solutions.

When Turkish titles were abolished in favor of fixed hereditary surnames, she chose the surname Suman. After learning photography in Austria, she opened a studio in her home in 1919. Her clients were mostly women and she took portraits and bridal pictures. Later, she taught photography classes at the sultan's palace. Early life Naciye was born on 23 April 1881 in √úsk√ºp, Ottoman Empire, in what is now part of Macedonia to Major Salih Bey. She was styled for a portion of her life with the title Hanƒ±m (meaning \\"lady\\" or \\"madame\\"). In 1903, she married a captain √ùsmail Hakk√Ω Bey (aka ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Bey). She had three children: Nusret Suman, who would become a sculptor; and two daughters Fikret and Nedret. As a result of the forced migration during the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913, the family was forced to migrate to Anatolia. During the migration, Suman lost her fourth child near the Hungarian border. Though the family made it to Istanbul, a trusted friend helped them escape the conflict relocating them to Vienna. Photography at that time was a novelty, and Suman studied to learn the skill. The following year, 1914, her husband was called back to Turkey and the family, which included Suman, her husband, three children, his mother, a grandmother and three servants, were moved into the Saitpa≈üa Mansion in Yƒ±ldƒ±z in the Be≈üikta≈ü district of Istanbul. She brought her camera equipment with her and set up a small studio in the laundry area of the rooftop. Career During World War I, Suman's husband was deployed to the front, and she was left at home to care for the household. The war was followed by the Turkish War of Independence and times were difficult. In 1919 when she had to sell the family silver to provide for the family, she decided on another solution. Suman hung a sign on the front of the mansion which said simply \\"T√ºrk Hanƒ±mlar Fotoƒürafhanesi-Naciye\\" (Turkish woman photographer-Naciye\\") and began working as the first professional Muslim woman photographer in Turkey. During this period, women were veiled and did not work, especially those who were daughters of a pasha, and yet from the first day, she had clients. Many women, who had men fighting at the front wanted photographs to enclose in letters. In 1921, she gave up the mansion and moved to a small apartment, moving her studio to a separate location. The business was featured that same year in Kadƒ±nlar D√ºnyasƒ± (Women's World), the leading women's magazine of the era. Besides taking wedding pictures, she also lectured at the Sultan Re≈üad's palace on photography. When the war ended, Suman left her husband and continued her photography business until 1930. That year, when her daughter had a baby, Suman closed the shop and moved to Ankara. In 1934, when the Turkish regime passed the Surname Law, allowing citizens to adopt hereditary surnames rather than using titles, Naciye took \\"Suman\\" as a last name. Suman died on 23 July 1973 in Ankara, Turkey. It was believed that her photographs were lost, but collector and writer, G√ºlderen B√∂l√ºk, has been able to document postcards with the studio stamp and preserve six of them.

Since 2008, shifting demographics in the United States are reshaping elections, changing the political landscape, and impacting policy at the federal, state, and local levels. Latinos and other racial/ethnic groups are challenging the ways in which politicians, academics and other cultural influencers consider and discuss race by upending this country's black/white racial binary paradigm. Latinos '08 features interviews with a wide range of prominent Latinos, including Henry Cisneros, consultant Lionel Sosa, columnist Ruben Navarrette Jr., Federico Pe√±a, Ana Navarro, Leslie Sanchez, Luis Cort√©s of Esperanza USA, and academics Lisa Garc√≠a Bedolla of University of California at Berkeley, Rodolfo de la Garza of Columbia University, Roberto Suro of the University of Southern California and Luis Fraga of the University of Washington. Production Latinos '08 was produced and directed by Phillip Rodriguez, an award winning documentary filmmaker based in Los Angeles. In 2002, Rodriguez founded City Projects, a production company whose films and educational programs challenge ideas about race and diversity in America. Rodriguez' documentary films bring to light the complexities of Latino culture, history, and identity at a time when our nation's demographics reflect unprecedented growth in the Latino community and the concomitant demand for relevant storytelling. Reception Latinos '08 received several reviews, including in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the San Diego Union Tribune, and a 2009 CINE Golden Eagle Award for Best News Analysis. The Washington Post: > One of the best things about the new PBS documentary Latinos '08 ... is that > it challenges a premise of such efforts‚Äîthe assumption that the Latino vote > is a monolithic bloc that can be appealed to and delivered as one. The film > commits an even more refreshing heresy: It questions whether the Latino vote > really is as critical as everyone says it is ... Yet credit the higher > truth-telling of this brisk, brief (one-hour) political, demographic and > cultural tour that it also resists taking refuge in easy contrarianism, > which is as overly simple as the conventional wisdom. Rather than present us > with a neat package of the Latino influence as either-or, this-or-that, it > unwraps the package and reveals something with more to it than many presume. The New York Times: > [T]his zippy little film about the Hispanic vote in the current American > presidential election isn't afraid to turn conventional wisdom on its head, > including the conventional wisdom that there is even such a thing as a > Hispanic vote. The San Diego-Union Tribune: > One thing [Latinos '08] makes clear is that this subject is much more > nuanced and complicated than many people imagine.

The city of Tundama, currently known as Duitama and part of the Tundama Province, Boyac√°, were named after the cacique. Tundama ruled over the northernmost territories of the Muisca, submitted last by the Spanish conquistadores. Tundama was killed late December 1539 with a large hammer by Spanish conquistador Baltasar Maldonado. His successor, Don Juan was killed shortly after, ending the reign of the Muisca in the New Kingdom of Granada, the name for present-day Colombia and Venezuela in the Spanish Empire. Knowledge about Tundama has been compiled by scholar Lucas Fern√°ndez de Piedrahita. Lucas Fern√°ndez de Piedrahita about Tundama  Background  In the time before the Spanish conquest of central Colombia, there were four main rulers and several independent caciques who governed the Muisca. From south to north the zipa of Bacat√°, the zaque of Hunza, the iraca of Sugamuxi and the cacique of Tundama were the ruling elites of the area. Duitama in those ages was a lake surrounded by hilltops. On the hill La Tolosa the tundama lived in a boh√≠o ornamented with golden figures.  Biography  Tundama was the last cacique of Duitama and the caciques of Cerinza, Chitagoto, Icabuco, Lupacoche, S√°tiva, Soat√° and Susac√≥n were loyal to him. Biography Cacique Tundama - Pueblos Originarios When a new iraca for Sugamuxi had to be elected alternating between the caciques of Firavitoba and Tobas√≠a, the cacique of Tundama intervened in case of conflict. Iraca rulers - Pueblos Originarios In the Battle of the Arroyo de las Vueltas (1514), Tundama supported zaque Quemuenchatocha against zipa Nemequene. = Spanish conquest and death = In 1536 the Spanish conquistadores led by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada set foot towards the interior of Colombia from Santa Marta. They heard about the legendary El Dorado and equipped with 800 soldiers and dozens of horses they started their march to the Andes along the Magdalena River. The Spanish troops arrived first in the southern Muisca territories, ruled from Bacat√° in the spring of 1537. From there they marched north and in August of that year they conquered Hunza, the capital of the northern Muisca. They were informed of the sacred Iraka Valley around Sugamuxi and found the Sun Temple which soldiers of De Quesada burned by accident in September 1537. Tundama got notice of the submission of the neighbouring indigenous groups, the Panche, Guane and others and told his guecha warriors not to bow for the Spanish invaders. When one of his warriors suggested surrender was the best option, Tundama cut off his ears and left hand. Biography Tundama The cacique declared a \\"death war\\" against the Spanish and gathered an army of 10,000 guecha warriors. To keep the conquistadores away, he sent a delegation of his people with emeralds, gold and mantles to offer the Spanish with the promise that Tundama would surrender bringing eight more of these. Gaining time, Tundama hid his treasures and prepared the defence of Tundama. On December 15, 1539, another Spanish leader coming from the south after conquering Peru and the Kingdom of Quito, Baltasar Maldonado, entered the territories of Tundama and offered him a peace proposal if he would surrender. Tundama, informed by the Spanish murders of zipa Tisquesusa and zaque Quemuenchatocha, did not accept and Maldonado attacked Tundama and his army on the island in Vargas Swamp, where 280 years later the Vargas Swamp Battle by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var would be fought. Battle of Vargas Swamp, 1819 Maldonado, enforced with 2000 yanakunas; indigenous prisoners of war from Peru and submitted people from Bacat√° and Ramiriqu√≠, was accompanied by the Muisca whose ears and hand had been cut off by Tundama. The Spanish conquistador with his superior weapons, cavalry and the inside knowledge of the earless Muisca killed 4000 guecha warriors of Tundama. Seeing this battle was fruitless, Tundama fled to Cerinza to ally with the cacique from there and prepared a new attack on the Spanish and indigenous troops, losing again. The caciques of northern Boyac√° convinced Tundama to not fight anymore and Tundama surrendered to the Spanish troops. Maldonado demanded huge quantities of gold and emeralds to pay his loss to the Spanish. When handing over the valuables, Maldonado deemed the payments not enough and before the end of the year Maldonado killed Tundama with a large hammer. Animated video about Tundama After Tundama was killed, according to the Muisca tradition of inheritance, his nephew Don Juan took over the role of cacique. He was killed shortly after, ending the era of the Muisca in northern Boyac√°.

Location and extent  Shakti- Sangam-Tantra, a Shakti cult text composed before 7th century CE, states that Lata was located to the west of Avanti (India) and to the north-west of Vidarbha. According to Tej Ram Sharma, Lata's northern boundary was formed by the Mahi River, or at times, by the Narmada River. In the south, Lata extended up to the Purna River, and at times, up to Daman. It included Surat, Bharuch, Kheda and Vadodara. According to Georg B√ºhler, Lata was the area between Mahi River and Kim River, and its major city was Bharuch.  Historical mentions  The Lata region is not mentioned in the earliest of the Puranas or the Sanskrit epics. The earliest mention of the region probably comes from the writings of the 2nd century Greco-Egyptian writer Ptolemy. The Larike mentioned by him is identified with Lata by multiple scholars including H. D. Sankalia and D. C. Sircar, The Greek name might have derived from LƒÅr-de≈õa (\\"LƒÅr country\\"), the Prakrit form of LƒÅ·π≠a. Ptolemy mentions that the delta of the river Mophis (identified with Mahi) and Barygaza (Bharuch) were located in Larike. Vatsayayana in his Kama Sutra of the third century calls it L√°·π≠a; describes it as situated to the west of Malwa; and gives an account of several of the customs of its people. In Sanskrit writings and inscriptions later than the third century, the name is frequently found. In the sixth century, the astronomer Varahamihira mentions the country of L√°·π≠a, and the name also appears as L√°·π≠a in an Ajanta and in a Mandasor inscription of the fifth century. It is common in the later inscriptions (a.d. 700‚Äì1200) of the Chaulukya, Gurjara and R√°sh·π≠rak√∫·π≠a kings as well as in the writings of Arab travellers and historians between the eighth and twelfth centuries. Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa mention that Prince Vijaya came from the Sinhapura city in the Lala or Lada region. This region is variously identified as Lata in Gujarat or Rarh in Bengal. In the Gupta-era records, Lata is mentioned as a vishaya (IAST: vi·π£aya) or district. The LƒÅ·π≠a-vi·π£aya was well-known until the 8th century. The Latesvara country mentioned in some early Gurjara-Pratihara and Rashtrakuta records is probably same as Lata. The Chalukyas of Lata ruled the region during the 10th and 11th centuries.

History Embroidered bindings were produced by professional as well as amateur embroiderers or needle workers. Examples of embroidered bookbindings are known throughout England and Europe from the 13th century to the present, and were most popular in England during the first half of the 17th century. These bindings were most often created for prayer books, Bibles, devotional texts, and as presentation copies for clergy or the Royal family. Designs Designs include flowers and foliage, sacred emblems or royal portraits, arabesque, heraldic, or figural elements. \\"The most common designs were Old Testament scenes featuring Adam and Eve, Moses and Aaron, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, or David playing his harp, and New Testament scenes and figures of the saints. There were also allegorical figures, such as Peace and Plenty or Faith and Hope, flora and fauna, and heraldic subjects. The use of portraits came into fashion in the 17th century. Initials and coats of arms were added to personalize the work.\\" Materials Materials utilized to create embroidered bindings included linen, colored silk or metallic thread, pearls and sequins used in decorating canvas, silk, velvet or brocade covers. \\"The cloth was embroidered separately before it was glued or stitched to the boards of a ready bound book; embroidered covers do not form part of the binding structure.\\" Image gallery File:Front covers, V.a.94.jpgFolger Shakespeare Library's V.a.94.

It was the largest library in the South Island and the third-biggest in New Zealand. It opened in 1982 on the corner of Oxford Terrace and Gloucester Street but was closed on the day of the 21 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The building was demolished in 2014 to make way for the Convention Centre Precinct. The replacement library, T≈´ranga, opened in 2018. History The Christchurch library dates back to 1859 and the original library buildings were on the corner of Cambridge Terrace and Hereford Street. Eventually over 100 years old, a replacement was needed, and after years of searching for a suitable site, the property on the corner of Gloucester Street and Oxford Terrace was purchased in 1974. The new site was again facing the Avon River, was across the river from the historic Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings, and was only a short walk away from the town centre in Cathedral Square. The architecture firm Warren and Mahoney was engaged to design the building, and Charles Luney was the principal contractor. The total price for the site and construction was NZ$5.8m. The building was opened by Sir David Beattie, the Governor-General, on 2 February 1982. Membership grew dramatically after the opening, and within three months, 10,000 new members were gained. The library had four floors, with a total area of . The ground floor and the first floor were linked by an escalator, with the second and third floor used for internal services. Another one and a half floors were added in 1997, and another escalator was added from the first to the second floor, expanding the area open to the public. Further changes were made to the building in 2001. Earthquakes Christchurch Central Library during demolition Whilst the library building suffered little structural damage in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the central city was declared a redzone and the city centre was not accessible to the public. With the red zone cordon shrinking over time, alternative central city library locations were established in South City Mall (8 July 2011 ‚Äì 15 July 2012), Peterborough Street (19 December 2011 ‚Äì present), Tuam Street (July 2012 ‚Äì November 2013), and Manchester Street (20 January 2014 ‚Äì present). The Tuam Street library was conveniently located adjacent to the temporary bus exchange and became necessary as more books were recovered from the central building in Gloucester Street, but it closed again as the land was designated for the Justice and Emergency Services Precinct. The Christchurch Central Library building was located within the area that the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan designated for the Convention Centre Precinct and for that reason, the building was demolished during September and October 2014. The replacement library, named T≈´ranga, opened in October 2018.

A specialist sprinter, he showed his best form as a two-year-old in 1999 whe he won his last five races including the Sirenia Stakes, Mill Reef Stakes and Middle Park Stakes. He recorded his only subsequent victory in 2001 when he won the Abernant Stakes. He made little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Primo Valentino was a small \\"chunky\\" bay horse foaled on Valentine's Day 1997. He was bred in Ireland by Pendley Farm, the breeding organisation of his owner and trainer Peter Harris. He was sired by Primo Dominie, a high-class two-year-old and sprinter who won four Group races in 1984 and 1985 before going on to sire over six hundred winners during his stud career. Apart from Primo Valentino, his best offspring were First Trump and the Premio Roma winner Imperial Dancer. Primo Valentino's dam Dorothea Brooke won one of her ten races and became a successful broodmare who produced the Cherry Hinton Stakes winner Dora Carrington. She was a daughter of Connaught Bridge whose wins included the Nassau Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks in 1979 and who was, in turn, a descendant of the broodmare Rustic Bridge, the female-line ancestor of Cantelo and Yeats. Harris owned the colt in a partnership known as the Primo Donnas and trained him at his stable at Ringshall in Buckinghamshire. Racing career =1999: two-year-old season= Primo Valentino was ridden in his first three starts by Pat Eddery. He made his racecourse debut in a race over five furlongs at Windsor Racecourse on 17 May in which he started the 5/4 favourite and finished second, beaten one and a quarter lengths by Barringer. Two weeks later the colt was stepped up in class for the Listed National Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse and finished fourth of the seven runners behind the Mick Channon- trained Rowaasi. He was then dropped back in class for a maiden race on 12 June at Leicester Racecourse and recorded his first success, leading from the start and winning easily by six lengths from Breathless Dreams. Jimmy Fortune took over from Eddery when the colt started 4/7 favourite for a minor race at Goodwood two weeks later and won by two lengths from Halland Park Girl. After a break of two and a half months, Primo Valentino returned in the Listed Sirenia Stakes over six furlongs at Kempton Park on 8 September. Ridden by Michael Roberts he started the 15/8 favourite against five opponents including the fillies Kashra and Seazun and the colt Ginola's Magic (third in the Richmond Stakes). After tracking the leaders, Primo Valentino took the lead a furlong out and won \\"cleverly\\" by half a length from Seazun with a gap of three and a half lengths back to Imperialist and third. Ten days later the colt started 6/5 favourite for the Group Two Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury with his three opponents being Observatory, Ma Yoram (runner-up in the Gimcrack Stakes) and the Barry Hills-trained Trouble Mountain. Before the race, a spokesman for the stable said \\"He has done very little wrong. We thought he was a good horse right from the beginning and he must have a serious chance\\". Primo Valentino led from the start, accelerated a furlong out and won \\"readily\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Trouble Mountain. Primo Valentino was reunited with Eddery when the colt contested the Group One Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket on 30 September and started 100/30 second favourite behind Invincible Spirit. The other runners were Warm Heart (Norfolk Stakes), Brahms (runner-up in the Futurity Stakes) and the maiden race winners Fath and Trinculo. Eddery sent Primo Valentino into the lead from the start, with Fath and Brahms being his closest pursuers. The order remained the same throughout, with Primo Valentino running on \\"gamely\\" in the final furlong to win by a neck from Fath, with Brahms just over a length away in third. =2000: three-year- old season= On his three-year-old debut Primo Valentino was tested over one mile for the first and only time when he contested the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 6 May. Starting a 16/1 outsider he showed \\"terrific speed\\" to lead the field until tiring a furlong from the finish and finished seventh of the twenty-seven runners behind King's Best. The colt returned to sprint distances four weeks later when he was sent to Germany for the Group Three B√©nazet-Rennen over 1200 metres but despite starting the odds-on favourite he again faded in the closing stages after setting the early pace and finished sixth. The Racing Post described his performance as \\"desperately disappointing\\". Primo Valentino's best performance of 2000 came when he faced an international weight-for-age field in the July Cup at Newmarket. He led the field and stayed on after being overtaken a furlong out to finish fourth behind Agnes World, Lincoln Dancer and Pipalong. On his final appearance of the year he was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and finished ninth behind the Irish colt Namid. =2001: four-year-old season= Primo Valentino was expected to be retired at the end of the year, but plans were changed: a stable spokesman said \\"his two worst runs last season were both abroad, so the thinking now is that he might not be a good traveller\\". He made his first appearance as a four-year-old in the Listed Abernant Stakes at Newmarket in April and started the 9/1 third choice in a twenty-three runners field. Under what was described as a \\"perfectly judged\\" ride from Richard Quinn he went to the front from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by one and a quarter lengths from Fath. The colt failed to build on his promising start in his two subsequent races, finishing at the rear of the field in both the Cork and Orrery Stakes and the July Cup. Stud record Primo Valentino was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He was based at the Bearstone Stud before moving to the Yorton Farm Stud in Shropshire in 2007. He struggled to attract high-class mares and was exported to Iran in 2011. The most successful of his offspring has been Clever Cookie, a gelding whose wins have included the Premier Kelso Hurdle, Ormonde Stakes and the Yorkshire Cup.

The firm was founded in 2009 by co-founders Mike Stringer and Dean Malmgren after the two realized the lodes that could be extracted from data science. In addition to analyzing massive amounts of data, the firm builds useful tools for people, organizations and companies to learn from data, and be more quantitative in how they approach different problems. Their data science services include strategy consulting, software development and training. __FORCETOC__ History Datascope was founded in 2009 by Mike Stringer and Dean Malmgren. Stringer received a BS in Engineering Physics from the University of Colorado and a PhD in Physics from Northwestern University. Malmgren received a BS from the University of Michigan and a PhD in Chemical and Biological Engineering from Northwestern University, where he was a research fellow alongside Stringer. It was during their time at Northwestern that they began to realize the lodes that could be extracted from data science, more specifically, the useful tools they can provide people, organization and companies. The company has worked with industry leaders like Thomson Reuters, Procter & Gamble, Motorola, Kaplan, Daegis, and the Detroit Pistons, to emerging tech companies and nonprofits. In 2011, Datascope began the Data Science Chicago Meetup, which now has over 3,635 members, as well as Data Science Madison, founded in 2014, which currently has 363 active members. The group discussions range from tutorials on new technologies and their applications to success stories from practitioners, as well as cutting-edge academic data science and social activities. In 2016, they founded a Chicago Women in Machine Learning and Data Science team. The Meetup discusses machine learning and data science in an informal setting with the purpose of learning about top-notch research and technology, while building a community around women in these fields. In 2014, Datascope launched a data science boot camp for New York-based Metis, part of the Kaplan education network, helping others accelerate their data science careers. Datascope helped create the curriculum. Recently, Kaplan expanded their data science boot camp into the San Francisco and Chicago market, still utilizing Datascope's curriculum as a basis. Culture Bootstrapped since their inception, Datascope worked out of Northwestern University's Farley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation their first year in business. Unlike most companies that have predetermined hierarchy, Datascope quickly adopted a completely flat company structure, which gives each employee the same monthly salary, and allows each employee the opportunity to take on a leadership role. These roles are chosen based on whichever employee finds a particular project to be the most mentally and creatively stimulating. To ensure this, Datascope custom-built an operating agreement to retain a flat organizational structure that reflects the company's culture.

The company name is rooted in the fact that for over 104 years they have published numerous regional buyers guides listing commercial construction companies, largely subcontractors and suppliers. Now twice annually (Spring & Fall), 32 regional blue book editions are delivered to property managers, facilities managers and commercial general contractors. It is often compared to a yellow pages for contractors, given the focus on mini ads within The Who's Who of Building & Construction and the more recent evolution of search engine marketing.  History  1937 edition of the Subcontractors Register The company traces its roots to when Joseph O'Malley, president of The Society of the Allied Building Trades, first published a subcontractor's registry for New York City in 1913. The Subcontractors Register for the Allied Building Trades was a directory of subcontractors for the New York City area, listing companies by their trade. It was published by Joseph O'Malley (1893‚Äì1985) who was later joined by his nephew, Walter Francis O'Malley, as editor. The 1942 version calls itself: \\"A Classified List for the Allied Building Trades of Sub-Contractors, Material Dealers & Manufacturers, General Contractors & Builders, Architects - Engineers, Real Estate Management Firms\\". Later expansion in the New York and New England markets took place. The Blue Book spread to the west coast by 1992 and (the hard cover edition) was permanently retired in 2016. It was subsequently replaced by a series of bi-annual regional magazines called The Who's Who in Building & Construction. The prior content of the hard bound book was transitioned online and referred to as The Blue Book Network. The web-based buyer's guide contains critical information on architects, contractors, manufacturers, suppliers, vendors, and other companies relevant to the commercial bidding and build process. In 1999, the company extended its focus to include bid messaging and private project reporting. A private and secure online plan room providing full reporting called BB-Bid was released at no cost to general contractors and property/facility managers. The BB-Bid software allowed a user to upload a construction project onto the site and message the bid to the subcontracting and supplier community, regardless of their presence in the paid print directory.http://www.thebluebook.com/about/news-room/bb-bid-2012.html In 2013, the company became an Employee Owned Corporation with the creation of an employee stock ownership plan devised by then owner James O'Malley. James O'Malley had been the CEO for over 50 years. In 2014 they partnered with .BUILD to help commercial construction companies secure their targeted domain and appropriate domain name registration.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140306006192/en/Blue- Book-Network-Announces-Agreement-.BUILD-Provide In 2016, The Blue Book introduced its new regional construction magazines - The Who's Who in Building & Construction (and each edition includes their regional buyer's guide).

The hundred was one of the last to be created in Kent, unlike the majority of Kent hundreds, it was not formally constituted in the Domesday Book of 1086, but came into being sometime after. Today the area is mostly rural and located in the southern part of the Sevenoaks District, south of Sevenoaks and west of Tonbridge. Somerden Hundred was approximately wide east to west, and long north to south, and had a small exclave about out from its south east corner.

Somerden, like the other hundreds in Kent, became less significant gradually over time, and although never formally abolished, it was obsolete by 1894 with the creation of new districts. The majority of Somerden became part of the Sevenoaks Rural District in 1894, which in turn merged with the Sevenoaks Urban District in 1974 to become the Sevenoaks District which remains up to present day.

As a result of early freezing to the Danube, the refugees in the Yugoslav river- port of Kladovo had to overwinter. In 1940, they waited in vain on a sea-going vessel for the onward journey, and they had to move to the port of ≈†abac on the Sava, where they were caught by the Nazis in 1941. Only about 200 young people, as well as a few adults could be saved or escape on their own. The men of the transport were shot on 12 and 13 October by units of the Wehrmacht on the orders of General Franz B√∂hme. The women were transferred in early January 1942 to Sajmi≈°te concentration camp, and murdered between 19 March and 10 May 1942 in a gas van, under . Background In 1917, the Balfour Declaration by the British in establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine, promised the possibility of legal immigration (Aliyah), was limited in the 1920s, by the introduction of a quota system with certificates of different categories. from In the 1930s, Zionist organizations responded with the implementation of illegal transports (Aliya Bet). At the turn of 1938/1939, within the Zionist movement, Haganah in Palestine, Mossad LeAliyah Bet was set up for the organization of illegal shipments. Between the annexation of Austria to the German Reich and the beginning of the Second World War, 17,000 people in 50 illegal transports Europe left Europe.Gabriele Anderl, Walter Manoschek: Gescheiterte Flucht.

Austrian Jews were largely assimilated; they supported Jewish integration with financial and moral support, without thinking of your own emigration. Hechaluz , which has existed since the 1920s, was Viennese branch organization of the Zionist umbrella organization, and served mainly as a transit station for Eastern European Jews.Gabriele Anderl: Generationenkonflikte. Die zionistische Auswanderung aus √ñsterreich nach Pal√§stina in der Zwischenkriegszeit. In: Frank Stern, Barbara Eichinger (Hrsg.): Wien und die j√ºdische Erfahrung 1900‚Äì1938. Akkulturation ‚Äì Antisemitismus ‚Äì Zionismus. B√∂hlau Verlag, Wien/K√∂ln/Weimar 2009, , S. 79, 81. With the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in 1938, the Nuremberg laws were adopted overnight. The aggressive policy of expulsion by the Nazis, allowed the emigration to a foreign refuge. In May 1939, the British Mandate government in Palestine published the \\"White Paper\\", by which the immigration for the next five years had been limited to 75,000. Other countries limited the immigration possibilities drastically. After 1938, Ralph Weingarten held a refugee conference in Evian described his impression of the situation: It became increasingly difficult for Jews to escape the threat of the Nazis, as their sphere of influence grew. Illegal immigration to Palestine was more and more important, as the organization of transport had been hampered, by the outbreak of war. The British considered Jewish refugees from the hostile areas as \\"enemy aliens\\" as they left the Balkans to acquire disused ocean vessels. In Romania, 3,000 refugees already waited for their onward journey. In the fall of 1939, Adolf Eichmann, founder of the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, put pressure on Georg √úberall, Secretary General of the Austrian Hechaluz. Eichmann threatened, that all not yet emigrated Hechaluz members - there waited hundreds in the Hachshara camps outside Vienna on their departure - to deport them to Poland, if they did not leave the country. In addition, he ordered \\"the Committee for Jewish Overseas transport\\" and appointed , as a head of work. Although he was a Jew, but not a Zionist, and in 1939 with support from the SS became increasingly influential in the organization of illegal transport. The Hechalutz representatives saw him as a collaborator of the Nazis and avoided contact, thereby ultimately leading to failure in the project.  Organization of transport  In the face of threats, Eichmann decided to dissolve the Hechaluz centers as soon as possible and to bring its members out of the country, and in spite of intensive efforts in Italy, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria, by Mossad agents, no cruise ship could be obtained. The Mossad agent Moshe Agami gave his assent to the transport. Ferdinand Ceipek, a former National Socialist, supported the Jewish rescue attempts and helped with 800 regular entry visas to Slovakia. For the first time, an illegal transport were also allocated to groups of Youth Aliya. This approach was very controversial; the director of the Vienna Youth Aliyah, Aron Menczer, defended the decision. In a letter to a friend he wrote shortly after the departure of the group that there was no other way, and that the risk has been assessed, and was too good to pass up. The Group was approximately one third of children and adolescents up to the age of 17, of which one half was accompanied by their parents, and the rest in the care of youth associations. Another third put the 18- to 35-year Chaluzim of Hechaluz. The remainder was made up of veteran Zionists, who had previously been waiting in vain for entry certificates, because of their age, as well as couples and not least individual Jews who were still able to pay a lot for the trip despite the political circumstances. Also mixed the participants with regard to their social origins were, they represented the entire spectrum of the Jews of Central Europe, and also their religiosity ranged from orthodox through temperate traditional to atheistic. Journey On November 25, 1939, the 822 selected for transporting persons were brought by train to Bratislava. They could only grab a backpack with personal belongings, which could not exceed more than eight kilos, and according to the \\"emigration tax threshold\\", ten Reichsmark in foreign exchange. Arriving in Bratislava, they were interned in the abandoned munitions factory \\"Patronka\\" and a former bachelor quarters ( \\"Slobodrna\\") and guarded by members of the Slovak fascist Hlinka Guard. They received provisions, by the local Jewish community. The group met 130 refugees from Berlin, 50 from Danzig and about 100 from Prague and Bratislava. While the Danube has already threatened to freeze over, they waited to learn in the camps without a connection for the onward journey. The Slovak authorities presented an ultimatum, to return the group to the German border. After about ten days stay they were brought to the port in buses and were able to board the DDSG steamship Uranus, flying the swastika flag. In this next few hours after the first lunch, all refugees had severe diarrhea, which led to the suggestion that they had been poisoned. At the border with Hungary, the transport was stopped and returned home. Contrary to the fears that had to stand the passengers now that Uranus was at anchor in Bratislava. The recent departure from Bratislava took place on 13 December. However, the DDSG refused due to the insecured onward journey to go to the Danube Delta. The passengers were then transferred from Budapest in midstream to the three small, Yugoslavian riverboat \\"Car Nikola\\", \\"Car Du≈°an\\" and \\"Kraljica Marija\\". These were chartered on behalf of Mossad agents Moshe Agami from the \\"Association of Jewish Communities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia\\" for a lot of money. With the three tour boats the refugees came to Prahovo, where they were to 30 December of 18, because they lack the entry over the Romanian border was prohibited. Meanwhile, the weather conditions made an onward journey impossible and they had the Danube iced up, went back to Kladovo, where they were to spend the winter. The general secretary of the Federation of Jewish Communities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Sime Spitzer, undertook to take over the supply of the group. These were, however, already stressed by the supply of rrefugees since the Anschluss. In addition, the port could only be reached with a 24-hour delay due to its unfavorable position and the winter conditions; including a seven-hour sleigh ride, as the nearest railway station 54 kilometers away. Despite the circumstances Spitzer promised to provide tolerable conditions for the refugees. Time in Kladovo The confined nature of the ships that had been willing to board people temporarily for the trip in Kladovo, were intolerable and threatening. The six cabins were reserved for the guide and the transportation physician and as a hospital room. All other participants slept huddled on benches and floors in a heated salon or in the cold on deck. The hygienic conditions were also catastrophic. Around mid-January coke- burning stoves were equipped, a converted tractor with 280 beds provided a relief ship and after a few weeks they were given permission to use a narrow shoreline for walking under guard by gendarmes. In Mid March 1940, Rose Jacobs, and delegates of American Jewish women's organization Hadassah, during a trip to Europe, noted the arduous journey to the travel group and expressed shock at the situation in a letter: Jacobs was of the opinion that it was only due to the intense cold that no epidemics had broken out - there was one of the coldest winter of the century. She observationed that the refugees on board had, inter alia, already set up a shoe and clothes repair shop, brought out their own newspapers and led Hebrew and English courses. The end of March, the ships were laid in the summer port. Through its proximity to the city, some refugees who were given passenger bills could move more freely for the first time in four months. As the steamer were used by the shipping company again and also cost about $1,000 per day, they should be deducted and the people being placed on land. On May 2, the \\"Car Du≈°an\\" and \\"Kraljica Marija\\" drove off, but the \\"Car Du≈°an\\" returned in the evening the same day back. 650 people were housed in the part consisting of mud huts and about 2,000 inhabitants in town - especially families and elderly, and 18- to 30-year-old members of Hachshara youth. They were partly private, partly housed in quickly built shacks. The rest of the Hachshara youth, members of the Youth Aliya and another approximately 80 people remained on the converted tug at the \\"Car Du≈°an\\". The Mizrachi Group remained as before at the \\"Car Nikola\\". For the Youth Aliya finally tents were procured in order near the ships build a warehouse. Additionally, they were allowed to use a 150 by 350 meter square for the movement, which was prepared in half as a sports ground. In letters to their relatives, the refugees praised the hospitality of the official authorities in Yugoslavia and that the population was very decent. From the spring of 1940, joined by other refugees, some alone, the group was thus increased to approximately 1,200 people. So around April, a 20-strong group of young Jews from occupied Poland reached the transport - all school friends from Bielsko. They fled in the dead of winter on Russia, the Carpathian Ukraine and Hungary. Among them was Romek Reich, who later married Herta Eisler. On May 12, Sime Spitzer and Chief Rabbi David Alcalay came from Belgrade and held on the sports field made a general appeal, where they praised the refugees for their perseverance, courage and promised they would still reach their destination. A train should reach within 24 hours Kladovo, to bring them to the Black Sea, where they could board a cruise ship in the port of Sulina. Since the Romanian authorities, the handing over of the train was initially denied and only local representative of the Jewish community association had to travel to Turnu Severin in order to negotiate with the authorities, the arrival of the \\"Penelope\\" was delayed for several days. On 21 to 26 May, tables and benches were installed on deck, and wooden bunks were installed in their five bunker rooms. In addition, there were five lavatories. Those refugees who were housed in Kladovo should, until two hours before departure to come to the \\"Penelope\\", the others relocated, and all continued to wait for a sign, when it would begin. There were many rumors about an imminent next trip, but they were all canceled at the last moment. Beginning in September 1940, a large illegal transport passed them: The Storfer transport was the last who could leave the \\"Reich\\". The ships \\"Helios\\", \\"Melk\\", \\"Palace\\" and \\"Uranus\\" did not stop to pick them up. Many had relatives on ships and were desperate because they could not contact them. Relocation to Sabac Because of the incipient action Heim in the German Reich, Kladovo became as a focal point for ships, for the refugees that finally had to leave. However, not in the desired direction: On 17 September 1940, they were, moored with a tugboat, brought in some 300 kilometers upstream on the Sava to Sabac, where they arrived on 22 September. In Sabac, couples and older people were housed with locals, all over the city in 380 private furnished rooms, while the majority of young people moved in an abandoned three-story flour mill. Various Zionist youth associations lived in another building, the religious Zionist Mizrachi in a smaller house. All the buildings were equipped beside bedrooms with shared kitchens. The center of the camp was a building block in which additional clothes, material and food magazines were available and various workshops could be used for retraining courses. Likewise, were in the building administrative offices and the office of a representative of the Jewish community federation. Two local Jewish doctors operated a private hospital with 20 beds, in an abandoned sanatorium. Although the Association of Yugoslav Jewish communities was formally responsible for them, they were able to largely manage themselves. The move to Sabac, in the life of refugees became more settled; they held concerts and lectures were given once a week until midnight output. They printed newspapers, and organized in the synagogue ≈†abacer regular classroom. They could visit the two cinemas in Sabac and one run by the Society of Friends Lesehalle. Although they were not allowed to officially accept any work, some still earned a little pocket money, which they could improve the food rations which were sparse. They asked their relatives for letters and interventions for obtaining immigration certificates to Palestine or to immigration channels in the United States, and also contacted even the local Palestinian authorities and the Jewish Agency. Mossad agents announced several times to continue their journey, the refugees packed up - and after the cancellation, which came every time at the last moment, again. So for example, the \\"Darien II\\", which had the end September 1940 left Alexandria and arrived in Istanbul in October. She was paid for by American Zionist organizations like the Hadassah. However, the direction of Constanta, where they repaired and it should be adapted for the transport, she recorded only on November 2, as there had been between the Mossad, the Americans and Spitzer inconsistencies due to the payment of the bill for the necessary coal. The adaptation work should take two to three weeks, after which the \\"Darien II\\" for the refugees should be available. However, the \\"Darien II\\" brought now 160 legal refugees who could pay full price, to Palestine. The background of this company are not known. When she came back to the port of Sulina again, the refugees should on December 2 leave there and were embarked in Sabac on trains. Then came the transfer of the shipping company, the exit must on the one hand be avoided because of the advanced season, on the other hand because of the uncertain political conditions; only a transfer of the highest authorities could be swayed. However, the Yugoslav Prime Minister rejected the responsibility for the transport. Spitzer, who was busy since their arrival, to continually find new ways and means for further transport of the group of refugees, organized in mid-December a special train to Prahovo, to send them from there by Romanian trains to Sulina. However, when the train came with Greek flagging, he thought it too great a risk, that he would not go, as he wrote to the Mossad agent Ruth Kl√ºger: Escape A few weeks before the German invasion of Yugoslavia, a small part of the refugees had certificates of Youth Aliya, the Zionist women's organization WIZO, and about 50 individual certificates. Among the about 200 to 280 people (the exact number is not known) were mostly young people aged 15 to 17 years, some younger children and girls who had already crossed the age limit of Youth Aliya, some adult caregivers of youth groups, and a few elderly had vouched for the relatives. They got Yugoslav interim passports issued, and had to get visas for Greece, Turkey and Syria. Young people were newly clothed by WIZO and were provided with food and other things necessary for the journey.≈Ωeni Lebl: Tragedija Transporta Kladovo Sabac. El mundo sefarad, 1997, abgerufen am 5. April 2016 (serbisch, 1. Platz beim 41. Wettbewerb der F√∂deration der j√ºdischen Gemeinden von Jugoslawien). Beginning March 16, they traveled in groups of 30 to 50 persons in succession. The journey of the last group threatened to collapse, as all railcars required for mobilization of troops in Yugoslavia; finally, they were able to leave. In the stations along the route, there were Jews who had learned of their passing, and supplied them with food and drinks. Because of bombing of the tracks in Greece and alarms, the journey to Istanbul by train took one week. In Istanbul, the group met in a hotel, and continued the journey by train to the Syrian city of Aleppo to Beirut. In Rosh Hanikra grottoes they reached the Palestinian border. After a stay in a detention camp of the British military, they were distributed to various settlements in the country, mostly kibbutzim, or they moved to relatives already living in the country. One of the rescued youngsters, Ernest L√∂hner returned later with the Hagana to Yugoslavia, and fought as Parachute liaison officer in Tito's headquarters, then he rose in the Israeli army to the rank of general. After the destruction of Yugoslavia With the invasion of Yugoslavia, on April 6, 1941 in Yugoslavia, the capitulation of Yugoslavia on April 17 and the subsequent destruction of Yugoslavia, the Kladovo refugees were overtaken by their pursuers, whom they had fled in 1939. Serbia was placed under German military administration, ≈†abac became a border town. Already on 16 April, one day before the capitulation of Yugoslavia, the commander of the Security Police and SD, Wilhelm Fuchs, took his first measures against the Kladovo refugees: Those who registered, were obliged to do forced labor (Zwangsarbeit). At the same time the theft of Jewish property began and Aryanisations in the 23,000 people counted Jewish community of Serbia. On May 30, the military commander Ludwig von Schr√∂der adopted a Jewish Regulation (Judenverordnung), which restricted people's lives harshly, and a labeling requirement did what they had to wear a yellow ribbon with the inscription \\"Jew\\". The Belgrade Jewish community has been replaced by the Gestapo by a \\"representative of the Jewish community of Serbia\\", whose board they made Sime Spitzer. Spitzer succeeded to send some letters and telegrams to foreign Jewish passages in which he asked both to money and to certificates. The answers were disappointing, especially the news of the fine imposed by the British entry stops for Palestine. Since German emigration was now prohibited, there was no way even for illegal transport. At the same time, Spitzer received the first reports that had already arrived in Croatia, of mistreatment and killings in concentration camps. After the German invasion, the population was in a state of shock, but there initially were no riots. In the spring, therefore, the combat troops were withdrawn from Serbia and Wehrmacht stationed occupation divisions. In Sabac were the Austrians 6th and 8th Company of the 750th Infantry Regiment of the 718th Infantry Division. On July 20, 1941, the refugees in the camps Sabac, were interned in a barracks just north of the city on the Sava. They had to pack on trucks and walk with all their things. The prisoners were assigned to various forced labor. In September, Felix Benzler demanded the immediate evacuation of the camp and the swift and draconian settlement of the Jewish question that it already came in Croatia. Guerrilla insurgencies and their consequences Between mid-July and August 1941, Josip Broz Tito's partisans committed approximately 100 acts of sabotage and were the strategically important and took a weapons factory in U≈æice. Until the end of July, there was losses of ten men in the first ten days of August, on the part of Wehrmacht. The Chief of the Security Police and SD ordered the execution of hostages and reprisals against the civilian population. Since the resistance of the partisans was not broken, the Wehrmacht commander of Serbia, General Heinrich Danckelmann, called for a reinforcement of troops, which was rejected because of the need in the East. In the event, \\"mixed Jagdkommandos\\" from the Security Police, SD and Wehrmacht units were set up, the soldiers were enrolled into the \\"methods of struggle\\" between police and SD. Although so far been no riots in the town of Sabac, the 3rd Company of Police Reserve Battalion 64, as a reinforcement of the three services companies of the 718th Infantry Division. On August 18, they hung ten hostages in the city. On the next day following a \\"hunting trip\\" about twenty kilometers west of Sabac about 30 partisans were shot. On the German side were a police officer and three soldiers; Ten soldiers were wounded. As \\"punishment\\" about ten to twenty ≈†abacer Jews were shot in the following night. Refugees of Kladovo group were taken out of interment, and forced to carry the bodies of the Jews through the city and then suspended on pylons. [6] The remaining 63 ≈†abacer Jews were herded into the concentration camp, which also housed the Kladovo- group. On September 3 Danckelmann stated in a report to the Wehrmacht Commander: In September, the resistance struggle intensified, which now involved the Chetniks. Partisans and Chetniks controlled throughout southern and western Serbia. Wilhelm List, competent Wehrmacht Commander Southeast for the entire Balkans, called for reinforcements in the form of a combat division, and in charge of Serbia General. For this post, he struck at the same time before Franz Bohme, who as \\"excellent connoisseur of Balkan relations\\" due to his experiences in World War I and - like other Austrians - because of that defeat harbored personal revenge. B√∂hme was appointed Commanding General Agent in Serbia and laid the 12,000-strong 342nd Infantry Division to Serbia. B√∂hme was ordered by Hitler, to \\"restore with the sharpest means order.\\" At the same time he carried out the command of Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, after which 50 to 100 civilian hostages were to be shot for every German killed. This should come, according to Keitel, from the ranks of political opponents. Boehme however meant by his command to \\"clean up the sheet\\" not only the rebels, but also ordered the arrest of all Jews of Serbia. On September 23, about 1,000 guerrillas penetrated and entered Sabac, and initially brought a factory and the power plant under its authority. Thus Sabac was the first city occupied by Germans, that was attacked by the partisans. The battle for the city, in which on the German side, a tank was used, lasted ten hours. Thereafter, the partisans withdrew again. That same evening a battalion of the 342nd Infantry Division moved under the command of Lieutenant General Walter Hinghofer. Under Boehme's command, they began the next day with the arrest of all 14- to 70-year-old male residents of the city, although they did not belong to the rebels. Their homes were looted, neither weapons nor ammunition were found. After three days, 4,459 male civilians were gathered in a square in the west of the city. During this action 75 men were shot from Sabac and five others were reported as \\"deceased\\". An engineering battalion of the 342nd division started now with the construction of another concentration camp north of Sabac: the camp Jarak, however, which was located on Croatian soil. The 342 division, from parts of the Division reserve, including an anti-tank company and the Radfahrschwadron were on 26 September 1941 onwards, about 5,000 men from the concentration camp Sabac, with them, the Kladovo men, on the run, without food and beatings and shootings for \\"insubordination\\" or because they no longer working, driven into the KZ Jarak. In Klenak the German guards were joined Croatian Army members. Already in calling this later as \\"blood March\\" a designated 80 men were shot. Of the Kladovo men, 21 found their death in the blood March. Finally, the plans were changed due to the unfavorable position of the military camp, Jarak, so the men again had to return to Sabac to the camp Jarak. There, the concentration camp had since been extended to an abandoned barracks, which were intended for the civilian population. The Kladovo men spent several days in the barracks until they were again postponed on October 4, and returned to the \\"Jewish camp\\" in the pioneer barracks. Shooting of the Kladovo men On October 2, 1941, news came in, of an attack on the guerrilla units of the Army regiment in Topola where 21 soldiers were killed. Then Bohme ordered 2,100 prisoners to be shot. It instructed the 342. division of General Hinghofer with the execution and clarified on 10 October his ideas: Women and children in the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp In early January 1942, the 750-800 women and children, of Kladovo were transferred from the camp in Sabac, managed by the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp. First, they were brought by rail to the lying on Croatian soil city Ruma, from where they had to walk to the Sajmiste concentration camp, located north of the Sava in the Zemun district of Belgrade. On their deep winter death march frostbitten children and old women fell behind in the snow.≈Ωeljko Dragiƒá: Die Reise in die Ewigkeit. 70 Jahre Kladovo Transport. Putovanje u veƒçnost. 70 godina Kladovo transporta. Twist Zeitschriften Verlag GmbH, Wien 2013, , p. 23‚Äì27 In the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp, there were already over 5,000 Serbian Jewish women, children and old people huddled in the cold walls of the pavilion 3. The Organisation Todt had neglected it, KZ to adapt in time, even though they had six weeks. In a bombing of the nearby Belgrade airport in April 1941, which had opened in 1937, the fairground had been severely affected. The barracks possessed no sanitary facilities except two wells, and the windows were broken. Through the roof snow fell and froze on the concrete floor. Only after some time, did the Organisation Todt provide three storey wooden racks for beds, without a ceiling, without sheets, and only straw that has never been changed. The food they got from the Belgrade care - from the remains that were left from the Belgrade population, supplied, on average, about 80 grams of food per day and person. For each of the 300 infants, there was 200 grams of milk per day. Every night, between 10 and 25 people died of hunger and cold. The bodies of the deceased had to be disposed by the inmates on the frozen Sava, where they were taken by the Belgrade municipality staff car, and driven to the Jewish cemetery. The camp hospital was crowded, so many patients may be transferred to Belgrade hospitals. A staff member said after the war as a witness: The person in charge of the camp, the head of the Gestapo Lothar Kraus, was replaced by Hans Helm in February 1942, testified which later: When the prisoners were protesting in January because of unbearable hunger, SS Sturmfiihrer Stracke threatened that immediately 100 of them would be shot if there were further protests. In January 1942, shortly before the transfer of the women and children of Kladovo, Herbert Andorfer was commander of the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp. The current manager, squad leader Edgar Enge was put to him as adjutant. Internally, however, the camp was passed through the Jewish camp self-government. According to Andorfer's statements an intimate relationship developed between him and the Jewish camp self-government. He drank coffee with them and told them they would soon be transported to Romania. The Sajmi≈°te concentration camp was regarded by the Germans in Serbia, only as a temporary interim solution until the deportation of Jews to the East. At the Wannsee Conference at the end of January 1942, however, it became clear that the deportation of Serbian Jews had no priority and they would have a longer stay in Serbia itself. That became inconvenient for the occupiers for several reasons, not least because the Wehrmacht required concentration camps for internment of partisans. For it was a matter of prestige, as it had already been used for summer vehemently for their deportation and the Jews were already collected and \\"ready\\". Murder in gas vans Andorfer was probably informed by the delivery of a \\"special vehicle\\" in the first week of March, in which the Jews were to be \\"put to sleep\\". To ensure the smooth running of the gassings, he forged a plan: he made known agent attacks in the camp, that there would for the time being, a stopover in a new, better camp on Serbian soil. When asked about details he responded with a fictitious order for the new camp. He assured them that each transport will be accompanied by a Jewish doctor and a nurse, who would go take care of their health. Assuming their situation could only improve, they looked forward to the relocation. The compilation of Transportation took over the Jewish camp that death candidates volunteered. According to a survivor, Andorfer still advised them to take only the most valuable things, because the Board would be very good in the new camp. From 19 March to 10 May 1942, from Monday to Saturday every day in the morning, a smaller truck came, in which the luggage was loaded, and the gray painted gas vans in which each group of items from 50 to 80 people got in realizing nothing. One of the drivers distributed more sweets to children. When all were inside the car, the hinged door was locked behind them. The gas car was followed by the smaller truck and a car, in which Andorfer and his aide Enge sat, on the Sava Bridge. Since the camp was on the Croatian side of the Sava, they had to pass Croatian border posts; however, special papers helped them to pass unobstructed. After that, the small truck turned off and brought the luggage to Belgrade depot of the National Socialist People's Welfare. During a brief stop of the driver of the car gas rose by a lever, whereby the exhaust gases are directed into the car. So the car drove across Belgrade and further to approximately 15 kilometers southeast located in Avala shooting (according to another source in Jajinci in VozdovacMilan Koljanin: Kurze Chronologie 1937-1944. In: Besuch auf Staro Sajmi≈°te. NS- Konzentrationslager Sajmi≈°te ‚Äì eine multimediale Recherche. Dirk Auer, Rena R√§dle, abgerufen am 13. April 2016.). There pits had already been dug by a prisoner command. Another inmate command had to get the bodies out of the car and bury themt in the pit. Finally, the men of the \\"gravedigger commands\\" were shot with machine guns and also thrown into the mass grave. Edgar Enge at his trial in the 1960s: In November 1943, when anticipating the German defeat, the Sonderkommando 1005 under Paul Blobel began to dig the buried bodies and stack them on pyres to burn. This cover-up lasted for four months. In May 1942, there were still a few survivors of Kladovo, together with a group of German Jews from Banat, in the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp. They were intended to cleanse the camp. When they were done, most of them were shot. Only a handful survived, mainly the Jewish who married with non-Jewish women, who were released on the promise of confidentiality. Of the last Jewish refugees accommodated in Sabac, only Dorothea Fink as Aryan and Borika Betting Dorfer survived, who already in late November 1941 took the permission for eye surgery in Belgrade to flee. Legacy Kladovo transport monument, Kladovo The fate of the participants of Kladovo became known only after the war, and then only partially. After 1945, the members were informed that all participants of transport would have been shot in the autumn 1941. Many of these families have never learned that the women and children were in the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp, and are eventually killed in gas vans. Even 50 years later, not all details of the events were known. Gabriele Anderl and Walter Manoschek reconstructed the events based on documents, statements from survivors, witnesses and members of the Wehrmacht, and surviving letters and diaries of the participants. The results they published in 1993 in the book Failed escape. The Jewish \\"Kladovo Transport\\". As late as 1992, Anderlecht reported in their contribution emigration and expulsion, which was published in Erika Weinzierl book expulsion and new beginnings, about the Kladovo transport. Zeljko Dragic during research for his dissertation, on the ratio of the Serbian Orthodox Church to Judaism in the 20th century, came to the three excursion boats and gave birth to the idea for an exhibition that was shown in 2012 in Burgenland Croatian Centre in Vienna. He collected further material and spent a week with witnesses from Israel in Serbia. In Jerusalem, Yad Vashem was built by the Israeli government to commemorate the Holocaust victims, where there is also a memorial plaque to the victims of Kladovo In 2002, on the Jewish cemetery in Belgrade, the Jewish community of Vienna built a monument to the 800 Austrian Jews transported. On 22 April 1995, the \\"day of remembrance of the victims of the genocide\\", a monument by sculptor was unveiled for the victims of the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp, on the banks of the Sava in Belgrade. The ten meter high, abstract composition of bronze is outside the boundary of the camp, so that they can be seen from the bridge and the fortress. On 8 July to 4 November 2001, the Jewish Museum, Vienna was held an exhibition, \\" Kladovo ‚Äì An Escape to Palestine\\". The basis of the exhibition were photographs that were taken by participants of transport during the flight and were by survivors Ehud Nahir from Palestine. The album compiled by Nahir was reproduced from Douer. In addition, a documentary film by Alisa Douer, was produced with the support of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism. The exhibition was complemented by a bilingual companion book. Alisa Douer and Reinhard Geir were the exhibition curators. Legal prosecution In 1966, Herbert Andorfer was investigated, and in 1967 could have been arrested in Munich. He was handed over to Austrian authorities and a short time later extradited to the Federal Republic of Germany, where he was sentenced for murder in 1968 to two and a half years in prison. In 1947, Franz B√∂hme committed suicide before his trial that year. In 1968, Edgar Enge was also prosecuted in Germany. However, he was indeed guilty to murder for aiding and abetting, was put on probation. References Sources *Gabriele Anderl, Walter Manoschek: Gescheiterte Flucht.

For a quotient stack X = [Y/G], the Chow group of X is the same as the G-equivariant Chow group of Y. A key difference from the theory of Chow groups of a variety is that a cycle is allowed to carry non-trivial automorphisms and consequently intersection- theoretic operations must take this into account. For example, the degree of a 0-cycle on a stack need not be an integer but is a rational number (due to non-trivial stabilizers).  Definitions  develops the basic theory (mostly over Q) for the Chow group of a (separated) Deligne‚ÄìMumford stack. There, the Chow group is defined exactly as in the classical case: it is the free abelian group generated by integral closed substacks modulo rational equivalence. If a stack X can be written as the quotient stack X = [Y/G] for some quasi- projective variety Y with a linearized action of a linear algebraic group G, then the Chow group of X is defined as the G-equivariant Chow group of Y. This approach is introduced and developed by Dan Edidin and William A. Graham, as well as Burt Totaro. later extended the theory to a stack admitting a stratification by quotient stacks. For higher Chow groups (precursor of motivic homologies) of algebraic stacks, see Roy Joshua's Intersection Theory on Stacks:I and II.  Examples  The calculations depend on definitions. Thus, here, we proceed somehow axiomatically. Specifically, we assume: given an algebraic stack X locally of finite type over a base field k, # (homotopy- invariance) if E is a rank-n vector bundle on X, then A_{p}(E) = A_{p-n}(X). # for each integral substack Z of dimension < p, A_p(X - Z) = A_p(X), a corollary of a localization sequence. These properties are valid if X is Deligne‚ÄìMumford and are expected to hold for any other reasonable theory. We take X to be the classifying stack B G, the stack of principal G-bundles for a smooth linear algebraic group G. By definition, it is the quotient stack [*/G], where * is viewed as the stack associated to * = Spec k. We approximate it as follows. Given an integer p, choose a representation G \\\\to GL(V) such that there is a G-invariant open subset U of V on which G acts freely and the complement Z = V - U has codimension > - \\\\operatorname{dim} G - p. Let * \\\\times_G V be the quotient of * \\\\times G by the action (x, v) \\\\cdot g = (xg, g^{-1} v). Note the action is free and so * \\\\times_G V is a vector bundle over BG. By Property 1 applied to this vector bundle, :A_p(BG) = A_{p+\\\\dim V} (* \\\\times_G V). Then, since * \\\\times_G U = U/G, by Property 2, :A_{p + \\\\dim V}(* \\\\times_G V) = A_{p + \\\\dim V}(U/G) since \\\\dim[Z/G] = \\\\dim Z - \\\\dim G < \\\\dim V + p. As a concrete example, let G = \\\\mathbb{G}_m and let it act on \\\\mathbb{A}^n by scaling. Then \\\\mathbb{G}_m acts freely on U = \\\\mathbb{A}^n - \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\}. By the above calculation, for each pair of integers n, p such that n+p \\\\ge 0, :A_p(B \\\\mathbb{G}_m) = A_{p+n}(\\\\mathbb{P}^{n-1}). In particular, for every integer p ‚â• 0, A_p(B \\\\mathbb{G}_m) = 0. In general, A_{n-k}(\\\\mathbb{P}^n) = \\\\mathbb{Q}h^k for the hyperplane class h, h^k k-times self-intersection and h^k =0 for negative k and so :A_p(B \\\\mathbb{G}_m) = \\\\mathbb{Q} h^{-1-p} where the right-hand side is independent of models used in the calculation (since different hs correspond under the projections between projective spaces.) For p = -1 = \\\\dim B \\\\mathbb{G}_m, the class h^0 = [\\\\mathbb{P}^{n}], any n, may be thought of as the fundamental class of B \\\\mathbb{G}_m. Similarly, we have :A^*(B \\\\mathbb{G}_m) = \\\\mathbb{Q}[c] where c = c_1(h) is the first Chern class of h (and c and h are identified when Chow groups and Chow rings of projective spaces are identified). Since h^k = c \\\\cdot h^{k-1}, we have that A_*(B \\\\mathbb{G}_m) is the free \\\\mathbb{Q}[c]-module generated by h^0.  Virtual fundamental class  The notion originates in the Kuranishi theory in symplectic geometry. In ¬ß 2. of , given a DM stack X and CX the intrinsic normal cone to X, K. Behrend defines the virtual fundamental class of X as :[X]^{\\\\text{vir}} = s_0^![C_X] where s0 is the zero-section of the cone determined by the perfect obstruction theory and s0! is the refined Gysin homomorphism defined just as in Fulton's \\"Intersection theory\\". The same paper shows that the degree of this class, morally the integration over it, is equal to the weighted Euler characteristic of the Behrend function of X.

Biography Born in Germany, Minna Bergmann married Caleb Keene (b. 1862) in Chelsea, London, in 1887. Caleb was a \\"decorator's apprentice\\" and brother of the landscape painter cum \\"photographic artist\\" Elmer Ezra Keene (1853‚Äì1929). Minna‚Äôs first mention in the photographic literature occurs in the late 1890s, when she is found submitting work (with some success) to competitions in the art journal The Studio and to a selection of regional photographic societies, including the Chelmsford Camera Club and Southsea Exhibition. After immigrating to Canada in about 1913, Keene was commissioned by the CPR to photograph the Rockies (1914‚Äì15). In 1920, she opened a studio in Toronto, relocating to Oakville in 1922. Despite innovating in and enriching photography, female photographers were not taken as seriously as their male counterparts. Keene won numerous prizes and established studios in South Africa and Canada; yet when she was featured in an article in Maclean's magazine in 1926, she was described as \\"a charming hostess\\" and a \\"home lover\\". Her daughter Violet Keene was also a photographer.

Education Ramaswamy completed high school at the Modern School, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, and then moved to the University of Maryland where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics with high honours in 1977. He completed his PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Chicago, graduating in 1983. He completed postdoctoral research at the University of Pennsylvania. Research Ramaswamy is a theoretician whose research investigates nonequilibrium statistical physics, soft matter, condensed matter physics and biological physics. His research helped found the field of active matter, which studies the motility and related collective behaviour of objects that convert local energy input into autonomous motion. He is widely known for formulating the hydrodynamic equations governing the alignment, flow, mechanics and statistical properties of suspensions of self-propelled creatures, on scales from a cell to the ocean. Key predictions‚Äîthat macroscopically aligned flocks of swimming bacteria are impossible, and that the addition of swimmers to a fluid can make the viscosity arbitrarily small‚Äîhave been confirmed in recent experiments. His insight into nonliving imitations of self-propulsion has led to design principles for chemotactic colloids, the first experiments observing giant number fluctuations in flocks, and the creation of flocks with a tiny minority of motile constituents. Awards and honours Among the awards he has received for his research are the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology in 2000 and the Infosys Prize in 2011.

He described his experience in that school noting that \\"the school authorities did not really have an educational programme for us, what they wanted to do mainly was to make us Christians and of course they did and that created a lot of tension between me and my family and particularly my father.\\" He would later join an American Southern Baptist Church seeking a more zealous approach of reaching others with the Gospel. During his university studies, he would eventually revert to Islam. Education After receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from the American University of Beirut in 1964, he moved to America to complete a Masters of Arts in Religious Thought from the University of Pennsylvania in 1966 and then a Doctorate in History of Religion from Harvard University in 1975. It was during his studies he resolved returning to Islam as his mother and father had wished for. Career Mr. Ayoub is currently Faculty Associate of Shi‚Äôite Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations and Co- Director at the Duncan Black MacDonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations for Hartford Seminary at Georgetown University. From 1988 to 2008, Mahmoud was Professor and Director of Islamic Studies at the Department of Religion at Temple University in Philadelphia, an Adjunct Professor at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, a Research Fellow at the Middle East Center at the University of Pennsylvania and a Tolson visiting professor at the Pacific School of Religion at Berkeley University. In 1998, Dr. Ayoub helped develop and start a graduate Masters of Art level program in Muslim- Christian relations and comparative religion for the Centre for Christian- Muslim Studies at the University of Balamand in Lebanon. Mr. Ayoub has also taught at San Diego State University, the University of Toronto and McGill University. Published work Mahmoud Ayoub is author of various books and publications, some of which are: * Redemptive Suffering In Islam (1978) * The Qur'an and Its Interpreters - Volume I (1984) * The Qur'an and Its Interpreters - Volume II (1992) * Islam: Faith and History (2005) * A Muslim View Of Christianity: Essays On Dialogue (2007) * The Crisis Of Muslim History: Religion And Politics In Early Islam (2014) Theological position Mahmoud Ayoub promotes a moderate interpretation and understanding of Islamic theology. A 2006 article about Muslim cab drivers and their adherence to the various religious rules and keeping the letter of the laws of Islam, when speaking to cab drivers transporting customers having alcoholic products, Ayoub is quoted saying \\"I know many Muslims who own gas stations [alcohol is prohibited in Islam] and sell ham sandwiches [pork is prohibited in Islam]. They justify it and I think rightly so; that they have to make a living.\\" In 2013 when responding to questions about ISIS/ISIL, Ayoub dismissed them as contrary to Islam, stating that extremism has always been a problem in the religion, noting that Islam is unique among faiths in that it was founded as both a religion and a state. Mahmoud clarified the ideal dynamic would be a balance between the two with the state remaining in ultimate control. He further stated that from Islam's earliest beginnings, some have challenged that balance and sought to impose brutal theocracies, citing one group early in Islamic history that acted much like ISIS, trying to found a theocracy and killing all those who resisted or disagreed with it. \\"My view is the action of ISIS is not unique. Extremism appears in every epoch of Islam.\\" At a lecture in 2013 at Oakwood University in Huntsville, Alabama, Ayoub said at the heart of the Islamic moral system is love, the basis for peace. In quoting a passage from the Hadith (collected sayings of Muhammad): \\"No one of you will be a true believer until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\\" In a 2014 article in The Jewish Exponent regarding religious observations, Ayoub's words are quoted ‚ÄúRepentance may be regarded as the cornerstone of religious life of both the individual and society.‚Äù In the media In 2009 Ayoub voiced his opinion regarding the idea of a U.S. Muslim college, believing Muslims are better off attending established American schools, saying U.S. Muslims badly need a seminary since there are none in the country: \\"I don't know that I would send my child to go to a college where they can only learn tradition. Young people have to live, I like mixing people. I don't like ghettos.\\" On 24 March 2015 the Peace Islands Institute brought together Mahmoud M. Ayoub and Neset Ulusal of Quinnipiac University for a discussion entitled \\"Muslim Voices Against Extremism\\". In a 2015 article Mahmoud's work was mentioned as helping develop a scholarly approach to inter-faith relations between Islam and Christianity. In 2016 Mr. Ayoub was mentioned being the ‚Äúdriving force behind establishing the chair and raising money for it‚Äù regarding the first academic chair in North America dedicated to Shi‚Äôi studies at Hartford to help complementing and contrasting dialogue balancing the predominant Sunni view of Islamic thought. Controversy In 2008 Professor Mahmoud Ayoub was instrumental in persuading the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) into donating $1.5 million for the Temple University Seminary chair office. This effort was met with warnings from David Horowitz claiming the IIIT group had funded terrorism and having terrorist ties. After the university seemed unable to publicly respond with an open acceptance or rejection of the donation, the IIIT withdrew its offer in December of that year. Although IIIT had been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Department of Homeland Security after the domestic terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, no charges were brought against their organization. Awards In 2012, Mr. Ayoub received the Distinguished Scholar Award from the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). Mahmoud has received a Kent Doctoral Fellowship, a Fulbright scholarship and a Canada Council Fellowship.

Gougar (July 18, 1843 ‚Äì June 6, 1907) was a lawyer, temperance and women's rights advocate, and newspaper journalist who resided in Lafayette, Indiana. Admitted to the Tippecanoe County, Indiana, bar in 1895 to present a \\"test\\" case, she was among the first women lawyers in the county. In 1897 she became one of the first women to argue a case before the Indiana Supreme Court. Gougar attained public notoriety for arguing a case on her own behalf for her right to vote in the 1894 elections. In addition to her advocacy work, Gougar became a public speaker and frequently campaigned to elect politicians who shared her views on women's suffrage and prohibition. She was the President for the Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association. An Indiana historical marker, dedicated in 2014, honors her efforts to secure voting rights for women. Early life and education Helen Mar Jackson was born on July 18, 1843, in Hillsdale County, Michigan, she was raised in Litchfield, Michigan, and educated at Hillsdale College. In 1860, she moved to Lafayette, Indiana, with her brothers and three uncles. She worked as a teacher in Lafayette's public school system and became a school principal in 1863. Marriage and family In 1863 Helen married John Gougar, a Lafayette attorney, and became his legal apprentice. Career Helen Gougar's career included work as a newspaper journalist, lawyer, and a temperance and women's suffrage advocate. In addition, she and her husband were active in Lafayette's civic and social affairs. She served on the committees of several local organizations, including the Young Men's Christian Association, Lafayette Home Association, Ladies Benevolent Society, and the Second Presbyterian Church, but her temperance and women's suffrage activities gained public attention in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Elizabeth R. Osborn, \\"Helen Gougar\\" in =Newspaper journalist= In the 1870s and 1880s Gougar worked as a newspaper journalist. She wrote a weekly column called \\"Bric-a-Brac\\" for the Lafayette Courier that produced a series of essays expressing her own views and included the text of her speeches as well as the opinions of others on temperance and women's suffrage. Her unapologetic writing style became her trademark. In 1881 Gougar began editing Our Herald, a weekly newspaper that supported temperance and suffrage issues, and became its owner.Adams, pp. 39‚Äì40. =Lawyer and women's suffrage advocate= Gougar began her public life as a temperance advocate. She claimed to have joined the women's suffrage movement after concluding that attaining voting rights for women would be an effective way to resolve issues for victims of domestic violence. Following her attendance at the annual convention of the National American Women Suffrage Association in 1881, Gougar returned to Indiana and began lobbying for passage of legislation allowing women to vote. She appeared before members of the Indiana General Assembly in February 1881 to urge them to support a bill allowing women to vote in national elections, but it failed to pass. A subsequent amendment to the Indiana constitution passed in the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate in 1881, but it failed to pass during the 1883 legislative session, a requirement before it could become a state law.Adams, pp. 40‚Äì41. Gougar also campaigned for state and national political candidates in an effort to elect politicians who supported passage of women's suffrage and temperance legislation. In the 1882 elections in Indiana she campaigned for Republicans who supported women's suffrage, but most of them were defeated by Democratic opponents. Gougar had more success in securing municipal voting rights for women elsewhere. In 1884 she traveled to Kansas to lead an effort to draft a municipal suffrage bill. Introduced in the Kansas legislature in 1885, it became a state law in 1887. Frequently criticized for her strong views on women's suffrage, temperance, and prohibition, Gougar sought legal action to protect her reputation on more than one occasion. In 1882, after Gougar discovered that she had been implicated in a rumor of \\"sexual infidelity\\" with W. DeWitt Wallace, a Republican candidate for state representative, she filed a civil lawsuit against Lafayette sheriff Henry Mandler, who acknowledged he circulated the rumors, and charged him with slander.Adams, p. 42. In Gougar v. Mandler (1883) the jury found in favor of Gougar and awarded her $5,000 in damages. The victory encouraged her to continue the fight for temperance and women's rights.Adams, p. 44. In 1893 Gougar sued Massachusetts congressman Elijah A. Morse for libel. Gougar tested the state's voting laws when she attempted to vote in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, in the November 1894 elections. After the county elections board refused to allow her to vote, she sued the board. Gougar, who became one of the first women lawyers in Tippecanoe County, made her first appearance as an attorney in the Tippecanoe County Superior Court in January 1895 on the same day she was admitted to the Tippecanoe County bar, in order to argue a \\"test\\" case. The judge ruled in favor of the election board, but Gougar appealed the case, which went to the Indiana Supreme Court in Indianapolis.Osborn, pp. 138‚Äì39. On February 10, 1897, Gougar became one of the first women to argue a case before the Indiana Supreme Court. In Gougar v Timberlake (1897), she presented the case on her own behalf. Gougar argued that voting was natural right of men and women and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution assured her the right regardless of the text in Indiana's constitution, which limited the franchise to males aged twenty-one and older. The Court, who considered voting a political right, denied the appeal, but Gougar's legal arguments were published in Indiana's newspapers, providing statewide exposure her views on the subject.Adams, pp. 44‚Äì45. Later years Gougar remained active in politics in her later life. The Prohibition Party nominated her for Indiana attorney general in 1896 and she campaigned for politicians who shared her views, including William Jennings Bryan. In addition she was a frequent public speaker and traveled extensively with her husband.Osborn, pp. 139‚Äì40. Death and legacy Gougar died unexpectedly at her home in Lafayette on June 6, 1907. Known as an advocate for the women's suffrage movement in Indiana, her death occurred more than a decade before women achieved voting rights under the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Osborn, pp. 138, 140. Tributes and honors A state historical marker in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, was dedicated in November 2014 in honor of Gougar's efforts to secure voting rights for women.

It is situated four miles north east of Mahuva and fifty-one miles south-west of Bhavnagar. It is built on the western bank of the Bhadrodi river. History Bhadrod is associated with Rukmi, brother of Rukmini. It is a place where he overtook Krishna when he was carrying off that lady, and a battle was fought, in which Rukmi was defeated and taken prisoner, and only released after Krishna had contemptuously caused his moustache and whiskers and the hair of his head shaved off. As Rukmi had solemnly sworn never to return to Kundinapuri unless victorious and unless he should in prison Krishna and bring back his sister Rukmini, he was much perplexed how to act now that he had been not only defeated but disgraced. He finally resolved to reside on the battle-field, and established there a small temple of Mahadev, which he named Bhadreshvar. By degrees a village sprung up, first called Bhadranagar which has by degrees been corrupted into Bhadrod. When the Valas were forced to leave Talaja by the Muslims in the time of Selait Vala (about 1544), they retired to Bhadrod and remained here for some time. During their rule, Gundala, between Nikol and Kalsar, was the port of Bhadrod. It is now waste, and there stands only a deserted temple of Hanuman on the old site. This temple is still called the Gandalio Hanuman. The Khasias under Vijo and Misri Khasia conquered Mahuva and Bhadrod in about 1744 from the Valas, and Misri Khasia established himself at Bhadrod, while Vijo Khasia resided at Mahuva. Here the Khasias remained till 1784, when they were conquered by Thakor Vakhatsinghji of Bhavnagar State. Since then Bhadrod was under Bhavnagar. When the Valas reigned at Talaja, Bhadrod belonged to them. Uga Vala of this line is a favourite local hero, and is said to have rescued Ra Kavat, the Chudasama king of Junagadh from the confinement of the chief of Shiyal Island. Four silver coins of the Indo-Greek monarch Apollodotus I were found at Bhadrod and one was found at Dhank, another ancient Vala settlement.

This section is titled \\"Part IV: Finding, Discussion and Narrative Regarding Certain Sensitive National Security Matters,\\" and summarizes investigative leads suggesting possible financial, logistical and other support provided to the hijackers and their associates by Saudi Arabian officials and others suspected of being Saudi agents. It was declassified on July 15, 2016. Contents thumbright [https://web.archive.org/web/20160715183528/http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/declasspart4.pdf Declassified 28 Pages] The 28 pages state that some of the September 11 hijackers received financial support from individuals connected to the Saudi Government.\\"Declassified version of 28 pages \\". United States House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. December 2002. Accessed on July 15, 2016. FBI sources believed that at least two of those individuals were Saudi intelligence officers. The U.S. Intelligence Community believed that individuals associated with the Saudi Government had ties to al- Qaeda. Plaintiffs in a 9/11 civil suit against Saudi Arabia have alleged that a November 1999 attempt by two men with longstanding ties to the Saudi government‚ÄîMohammed al-Qudhaeein and Hamdan al-Shalawi‚Äîto get inside an America West Airlines plane's cockpit was \\"a dry run for the 9/11 attacks.\\" The FBI reportedly confirmed that the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, D.C. paid for Qudhaeein and Shalawi's tickets to board that flight. The 28 Pages quoted a document from the FBI's Phoenix Field Office as stating: \\"Phoenix FBI now believes both men were specifically attempting to test the security procedures of America West Airlines in preparation for and in furtherance of UBL [Osama bin Laden]/Al Qaeda operations.\\" Some leaked information from CIA and FBI documents allege that there is \\"incontrovertible evidence\\" that Saudi government officials, including from the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles, gave the hijackers both financial and logistical aid. Among those named were then-Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar and Osama Bassnan, a Saudi agent, as well as American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al- Awlaki, 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta, and Esam Ghazzawi, a Saudi adviser to the nephew of King Fahd. Classification decision When the congressional joint inquiry report was published in July 2003, the 28-page section on possible Saudi links to the attacks was completely redacted at the insistence of the George W. Bush administration. Bush claimed that releasing the material would \\"reveal sources and methods that would make it harder for us to win the war on terror.\\" Movement to declassify the 28 pages In July 2003 Senator Bob Graham pressed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to release the material, in accordance with its authority under Senate Resolution 400, which established the Committee in 1976. However, the committee did not vote, and his request was merely denied. Then-chair Senator Pat Roberts and Senator Jay Rockefeller wrote Graham that \\"it is our view that release of additional information from Part Four could adversely affect ongoing counterterrorism efforts.\\" Graham later said the response showed that the Intelligence Committee had shown \\"a strong deference to the executive branch.\\" In the same month, Senator Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) joined approximately 42 Democratic senators in calling on President Bush to release the 28-page section which was censored for \\"national security reasons\\". Senator Graham stated the refusal \\"is a continuation of the pattern of the last seven months-a pattern of delay and excessive use of national security standards to deny the people the knowledge of their vulnerability.\\" In December 2013, Representatives Walter B. Jones, Jr. and Stephen Lynch introduced a resolution urging United States President Barack Obama to declassify the 28 Pages. House Resolution 428 of the 113th Congress had 21 co-sponsors when the 113th Congress concluded.H.Res.428 - Urging the president to release information regarding the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks upon the United States , 113th Congress (2013-2014) at Congress.gov. In July 2014, freelance writer Brian McGlinchey launched the website 28Pages.org to provide information about the 28 pages to the public and journalists, and to facilitate grassroots activism aimed at achieving their declassification. In January 2015, Representatives Jones, Lynch and Massie introduced H.Res.14 as the 115th United States Congress began. Its wording was identical to H.Res.428 in the previous, 114th Congress. It amassed 71 cosponsors. On June 1, 2015, Senator Rand Paul introduced Senate Bill 1471, the Transparency for the Families of 9/11 Victims and Survivors Act. Senators Ron Wyden and Kirsten Gillibrand joined as original cosponsors. No other senators cosponsored the measure, which sought to compel President Obama to release the 28 pages. In July 2015, the U.S. government released a 9/11 Commission document, compiled by Dana Lesemann and Michael Jacobson, known as \\"Document 17.\\" It was an overview of individuals of interest to investigators pursuing potential links to the Saudi government. Among dozens of named individuals are Fahad al-Thumairy, Omar al-Bayoumi, Osama Bassnan and Mohdhar Abdullah. Document 17 was first brought to public attention on April 19, 2016 by the website 28Pages.org.According to the former Democratic US Senator Bob Graham, \\"Much of the information upon which File 17 was written was based on what's in the 28 pages.\\" On April 10, 2016, 60 Minutes aired a segment on the drive to declassify the 28 pages, featuring interviews with former Senator Bob Graham, former congressman and 9/11 Commission member Tim Roemer and former 9/11 Commission member John Lehman. Steve Kroft also interviewed Sean Carter and Jim Kreindler, attorneys representing 9/11 family members, survivors and insurers suing the kingdom for its alleged support of the attacks. On the afternoon before the 60 Minutes segment aired, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement urging the release of the pages. The Saudi government voiced support for the declassification of the 28 pages, saying it would \\"allow us to respond to any allegations in a clear and credible manner\\". Congressman Stephen Lynch said, \\"I think there may be some duplicity on the part of the Saudis in terms of them desiring this to be disclosed.\\" In July 2016, during the 2016 Republican National Convention, a proposed plank supporting the declassification of the 28 pages advanced from the national security subcommittee of the convention's platform committee. A motion to kill the plank was approved by the subsequent meeting of the full committee Steve Yates led the successful effort to remove the plank. Declassification In 2016, following a declassification review, the Obama Administration approved the declassification of the partially redacted 28 Pages, the Joint Inquiry's only wholly classified section. The document was then sent to congressional leadership and on July 15, 2016, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence approved publication of the newly declassified section. Location of the 28 pages The document is kept in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) in the basement of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C.

Very young, he poses poems on paper and expresses his respect for humanity and its attachment to the spirit of tolerance. Typography and calligraphy are areas that he is passionate about, he explores the possibilities for creating and composing works visually, incorporating messages and poems. We find in Inkman's works as much the expression of his personal feelings, that a calligraphy work, a composition base of geometric shapes, often bold and intervene on many supports. The Latin characters and poems of the artist mix his roots Arab, his attachment to calligraphic art, as his modern vision of the world and the political social issues at play.

During his senior year, he had an 11-0 record with a 1.69 earned run average (ERA) and 114 strikeouts. He also was an all-conference and all-county basketball player in high school.

Entering the game to pitch the bottom of the ninth inning, he retired all three batters he faced on just four pitches to complete an 8-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.Janes, Chelsea, \\"Three up, three down: Koda Glover works quickly in his major league debut,\\" washingtonpost.com, July 20, 2015, 11:23 p.m. EDT. All four pitches were strikes, and at least two of them were 98-mph (158-km/hr) fastballs. Glover suffered a torn hip labrum midway through his time with the major league team, which he attempted to pitch through until disclosing the injury to pitching coach Mike Maddux after giving up a home run on September 26, 2016, at which point he was shut down for the season. Glover wore #32 in his first season in the major leagues. However, after the Nationals signed Matt Wieters to play catcher for the 2017 season, he voluntarily switched his number to #30 to allow Wieters to continue wearing the #32 he had worn with the Baltimore Orioles. In the early days of the 2017 season, Glover's left hip trouble recurred, and he was placed on the 10-day disabled list with what the Nationals described as a left hip impingement on April 26. The stint was short-lived, as he was activated on May 12. Manager Dusty Baker said he would share closing duties with Shawn Kelley after Opening Day closer Blake Treinen was removed from the role, although Kelley was reportedly to take on primary closing duties, with Glover filling in when he was unavailable. The Nationals' bullpen struggled over the first quarter of the 2017 season, marked by Treinen's travails in and eventual demotion from the role of closer in April and Kelley subsequently disappointing in the job as his home run and walk rates spiked. By late May, the role fell to Glover, with Baker describing him as the team's \\"most durable\\" option despite his earlier time on the disabled list and hip injury the previous season. \\"We're willing to give it to him as long as he keeps doing the job,\\" said Baker. Glover's improved slider drew national media attention after he struck out Hunter Renfroe to finish off the San Diego Padres with a 96-mph pitch breaking sharply down and away from the batter, the hardest such pitch thrown for a swinging strike all season. He notched four saves in five days toward the end of May while forming a back-end tandem with veteran setup man Matt Albers. Glover was placed on the disabled list on June 11 for the second time in the 2017 season with back stiffness after a blown save. While Glover initially said he had injured his back while showering, he later amended his story, admitting he had been trying to pitch through right shoulder pain since late May and that an MRI showed severe inflammation of his rotator cuff, pain from which he blamed for \\"overcompensation\\" that he said led to a vertebra moving out of place when he slipped in the shower. Glover was shut down from his rehabilitation in West Palm Beach in September after experiencing a setback. After starting the 2018 season on the disabled list after experiencing discomfort and being shut down with another bout of shoulder inflammation early in spring training, Glover rehabbed with the GCL Nationals and Syracuse Chiefs before being activated and optioned to Syracuse on July 22, 2018. Glover missed the entire 2019 season due to forearm and elbow pain. Glover announced his retirement from baseball on December 2, 2019. Pitching style Glover employed a four-pitch arsenal, with his fastball velocity topping out in the high 90s, a hard slider (which he sometimes described as a cutter) that often reached the mid-90s, and a changeup and curveball he threw less frequently. Retired baseball scout Bernie Pleskoff, writing of Glover in 2017, described him as having \\"a mound demeanor that exudes confidence and no-nonsense\\". Personal In January 2020, Glover was named head coach of the Howe High School baseball team.https://www.pbcommercial.com/sports/20200119/baseball-former-mlb-pitcher- glover-to-take-over-as-howes-coach References External links Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Le Flore County, Oklahoma Category:Baseball players from Oklahoma Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Washington Nationals players Category:Eastern Oklahoma Mountaineers baseball players Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball players Category:Gulf Coast Nationals players Category:Auburn Doubledays players Category:Hagerstown Suns players Category:Potomac Nationals players Category:Harrisburg Senators players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Cherokee people ","title":"Koda Glover"},{"id":"50534701","text":"The Bulgarian National Olympiad in Linguistics (Bulgarian: –û–ª–∏–º–ø–∏–∞–¥–∞ –ø–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ –ª–∏–Ω–≥–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞) is an olympiad for school students in Bulgaria, composed of three rounds: municipal, regional and national.

The works of Neiman and Roger Dean inspired Mark to change path and pursue a career in the Arts. Career Starting in the early 1980s Mark became known around Los Angeles and New York for painting photo realistic backgrounds for photography studios. This led to the chance encounter with the staff at Playboy Studio West and eventually Hugh Hefner where he was asked to figure out how to bodypaint realistic lingerie onto live models for Hef's exclusive events at the Playboy Mansion. Mark Frazier officially began his body painting career in 1987. He has worked as the bodypainter at every Playboy Party at the Playboy Mansion since the mid 1990s.http://www.laweekly.com/arts/las-best-body-painters-explain-their- secrets-2372061 His paintings, body paintings and photographs have been seen in and on; A&E;, Nat Geo, 20th Century FOX, NBC, Showtime, CBS, HBO, Fox Television Studios, Alta Loma Entertainment, Prometheus Entertainment, Evolution Media, MTV, E!, WE, KLOS, Entourage, Biography, History Channel, A Band Apart Productions, Cosmopolitan Magazine, Kandy Magazine, Black Men's Magazine, Quentin Tarantino, Playboy Magazine, Playboy.com, Playboy Special Editions, Playboy Mexico, Playboy Czech, Playboy Slovakia, Playboy Radio, Playboy Home Video,http://www.waterford-usa.com/body-painting.html The Girls Next Door,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2170708/ Kendra on Top, Botched (tv series), Yard Barker, Badger Airbrush,http://www.badgerairbrush.com/Accolades.asp Ben Nye Makeup, Benchwarmer, Sunset Tan, The Tom Leykis Show, Gay Pride LA, The Dinah, The Adam Carolla Show, Miller Beer, Budweiser, Daren Metropoulos, Papst Blue Ribbon, Colt 45, Bacardi, Nike, Coca-Cola, Red Bull, Sol Cerveza, Mandalay Bay, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, The Palms Casino Resort, The Playboy Club, Diana Ross, Southern California Edison, Edison International, Reef Brazil, Football Hall of Fame, Cartoon Network, LA Weekly, The Los Angeles MOCA, Arron Carter, Snoop Lion (Dogg), Wil Smith, and Greenlaw Partners.

The maximum bending moment M_{max} and deflection \\\\delta_{max}in the pictured beam is found using: :M_{max} = \\\\frac {q L^2} {8} :\\\\delta_{max} = \\\\frac {5 M_{max} L^2} {48 E I} = \\\\frac {5 q L^4} {384 E I} where :q = Uniformly distributed load :L = Length of the beam between two supports (span) :E = Modulus of elasticity :I = Area moment of inertia Note that the maximum bending moment and deflection occur midway between the two supports. From this it follows that if the span is doubled, the maximum moment (and with it the stress) will quadruple, and deflection will increase by a factor of sixteen.

Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (sometimes written Giovannantonio) (c. 1460s - c. 1528) was a calligrapher, author, printer and publisher based in Venice during the Renaissance period. Tagliente began his life as a calligrapher and taught around Italy before returning to Venice in 1491. He worked for the Venetian Chancery and was given a sinecure by the senate, becoming a publisher late in life. Tagliente's publications were textbooks and self-help volumes. These included guides on learning to read, arithmetic, accounting, embroidery patterns, textile production and a book of model love letters. Some of his books were very popular and were issued in dozens of editions. They have come to attention of feminist and social historians for their promotion of reading for women and the uneducated; his textbook on reading aimed to teach reading \\"in a period of two months, more or less depending on the intelligence of the reader.\\" He also wrote for a target market of potential civil servants. Tagliente published a writing manual, The True Art of Excellent Writing or Lo presente libro, in Venice in 1524, with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on his calligraphy. Tagliente's typeface was an inspiration for historically inclined typeface designers in modern times, becoming the inspiration for the italic of the popular 1928 book typeface Bembo.

It is affiliated with the Church of England. It was designed by architects Lewis Vulliamy and Robert Jewell Withers, and its construction was completed in 1845. The church was consecrated on 17 July of the same year. It is listed as Grade II by English Heritage. The church is built of white Suffolk bricks and is orientated east to west with the tower positioned south of the central bay. The entrance is through a porch, built into base of the tower, facing down Addison Avenue. The simple body of the church makes the three-stage tower, built in 1850, stand out. The first stage has gabled Buttresses with roll-moulded edges. The second stage has a clock-face set in on each side and is considerably shorter than any other stage. The final belfry stage has two deeply-recessed paired lancets flanked by single blind lancet panels. There is a drawing in Kensington Public Library which shows that the tower was designed to have been topped with a broach spire, however, this was never built, and the tower seems somewhat abrupt and unfinished without it, as the thin octagonal pinnacles on each corner stand out against the sky. The Interior, a view down the nave. Vulliamy's original design provided polygonal apsidal projections at the east and west ends, but these were never built. In 1876 the eastern end was extended by the architect, R. J. Withers. These extensions provide the present chancel, vestries and an organ chamber. The church is set in a small garden square, which is laid out in an informal style and is mainly two lawn areas with planting at the edges. The views are dominated by the mature chestnut and lime trees which surround the garden. These gardens are private and used by adjacent properties, and only open to the public occasionally. Present day The parish of \\"St. Clement with St. Mark, Notting Dale and St. James, Norlands\\" is part of the Archdeaconry of Middlesex in the Diocese of London.

In the latter half of the 1960s Bergveld started working as a scientific employee at the Technische Hogeschool Twente (which later became the University of Twente). Intrigued by discovering and measuring the origin of electronic activity in the human brain Bergveld started working on a new technique. In 1970, he completed the development of the ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) sensor. It was based on his earlier research on the MOSFET (metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect transistor), which he realized could be adapted into a biosensor for electrochemical and biological applications. In 1973, he earned his PhD at Twente, with a dissertation which delved deeper into the possibilities of ISFET sensors. Bergveld worked at the University of Twente from 1965 until he took up emeritus status in February 2003. He had been a full professor since 1983. At the university he was one of the driving forces for increased biomedical technology research and one of the founding fathers of the MESA+ research institute.

Edelson (July 31, 1926 ‚Äì January 6, 2002) was, for 20 years, a United States Navy Officer involved in advanced research and space science, a leader in developing satellite communications at COMSAT, and a leader of NASA's Space Science and Applications during the 1980s. His publications are held in libraries worldwide. He was a driving force in supporting the Hubble Telescope, the Halley's Comet Intercept, and in international technical collaboration. Early years Edelson was born July 31, 1926 in New York City to Samuel Edelson and Margaret Raff Edelson. He had a younger brother, Kenneth Joseph Edelson. Because of the Depression, the family moved in 1931 to East Lansing, Michigan. Samuel Edelson had bought the store out of bankruptcy from Fields, his former employer. Burton Edelson graduated in 1944 from East Lansing High School and received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. He graduated in June 1947 as part of the USNA Class of 1948A. Navy years After graduation, Edelson spent four years in the Pacific Fleet. He served on destroyers and minesweepers in San Diego, Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, and Shanghai. In 1951, Edelson attended the Naval Postgraduate School first in Annapolis and then in Monterey, California. He continued his studies via the Office of Naval Research at Yale University, off and on. He received a PhD in Metallurgy in 1960. He served in Norfolk, Virginia from 1954 to 1955 and in the Cleveland, Ohio ship building yards from 1955 to 1959. After moving to Washington, D.C. in 1959, he was assigned to the White House Space Council as a Navy Liaison. In 1965, he moved to the London Office of Naval Research where his responsibilities focused on technology exchange as part of NATO. He specialized in advanced communications. Communications satellite research and development years Dr. Edelson retired as a Commander in 1968 and worked at Comsat from 1969 to 1982. He was hired as the Assistant Director to Bill Pritchard for Comsat Labs that were opened in 1969. In 1973, he became the director of Comsat Labs where he directed advanced research in digital communications, satellite communications, compression technologies, maritime communications, teleports. Dr. Edelson was a cofounder in 1971 of Digital Communications Corporation (DCC) with John Puente, Andy Werth, Gene Gabbard, and four others. The eight founders each contributed $5,000. As digital communications and technology company founders, they were ahead of their time and had trouble securing financial support. Eventually, Dr. Tadahiro Sekimoto of NEC agreed to invest one million dollars in DCC. DCC later merged with Microwave Associates, becoming MA/COM MACOM Technology Solutions which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. DCC was eventually sold and became Hughes Communications. NASA space science and applications years In 1982, Dr. Burton Edelson was appointed by President Reagan as Associate Administrator for Space, Science, and Applications. At NASA, he championed international cooperation, advanced scientific research, and unmanned spaceflight. He played a leading role in the Mars exploration missions and the Hubble Space Telescope, and was associated with other programs such as the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite program, the Halley's Comet Intercept, as well as Mission to Planet Earth, . \\"When he came to NASA, the space science budget was at a low,\\" said Neil Helm, deputy director of George Washington University's Institute for Applied Space Research, which Edelson founded after retiring from NASA in 1987. \\"But he managed to increase the budget significantly, and established a number of programs that helped reinvigorate space science at NASA.\\" \\"There had been some talk about the Hubble telescope project at NASA before he got there, but he was the one that really got it going.\\" AT NASA, Edelson pursued the research related to the hole in the ozone layer in the 1980s which resulted in the banning of certain chemicals in aerosols. Educational Achievements: After the Founder's conference for the International Space University held at M.I.T. in April 1987, Dr. Edelson played a critical role in getting seed grants both from NASA and the European Space Agency that allowed the formal creation of the International Space University in 1988. Since the holding of this first session of the International Space University at M.I.T. in summer of 1988, the I.S.U. has graduated many thousands of students from over 100 nations around the world in its space studies program and Masters of Space Studies degree program and created its permanent global campus in Strasbourg, France. After retiring from NASA, Edelson directed research and development projects in satellite communications at George Washington University until his death in 2002.

The CPEC project envisages an expanded and upgraded road network in the aforementioned provinces, and will result in the upgrading or construction of worth of road into two- and four- lane divided highways by mid-2018 along the Western Alignment, as part of the Brahma Bahtar-Yarik Motorway, as part of N50 upgrades, of upgrades to N25, and of the M8 motorway with land acquisition sufficient for upgrading parts of the road to a six-lane motorway in the future. Route description =Hakla‚ÄìDera Ismail Khan Motorway= The Western Alignment roadway network will begin at the Brahma Bahtar Interchange on the M1 Motorway near the towns of Burhan and Hasan Abdal in northern Punjab province. The newly reconstructed Karakoram Highway will connect to the Western Alignment at Burhan, near where the new controlled-access Brahma Bahtar-Yarik Motorway will commence. The motorway will terminate near the town of Yarik, just north of Dera Ismail Khan. The route will traverse the Sindh Sagar Doab region, and cross the Indus River at Mianwali before entering into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It will consist of 11 interchanges, 74 culverts, and three major bridges spanning the Indus, Soan, and Kurram rivers. It will have reserved rights-of-way flanking either side of the motorway to allow for widening of the road to a six-lane motorway in the future. Total costs for the project are expected to be $1.05 billion. Pakistan's Executive Committee of the National Economic Council approved construction of this section of roadway in April 2016, while groundbreaking took place in May 2016.http://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/120599-PM-Nawaz- performs-groundbreaking-of-Motorway-in-DI-Khan Construction is expected to be completed within 36 months. =Upgrades to National Highway 50= At the southern terminus of the new Burhan‚ÄìYarik motorway, the N50 National Highway will also be upgraded between Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Zhob in neighbouring Balochistan province, with eventual reconstruction between Zhob and Quetta. The upgraded roadway will consist of a four-lane dual- carriageway spanning the distance between the two cities. The first portion of the N50 to be upgraded will be the portion of the N50 between Zhob and Mughal Kot, with construction works having begun in January 2016. Construction on this portion is expected to be completed by 2018 at a cost of $86 million, While the project is consider a vital link in the CPEC's Western Alignment, the project's cost will not be financed by Chinese state-owned banks, but will instead be financed by the Asian Development Bank under a 2014 agreement which preceded CPEC, as well as by a grant provided by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development. =Upgrades to National Highway 25= Heading south from Quetta, the Western Alignment of the CPEC will continue to the town of Surab in central Balochistan as the N25 National Highway. From Surab, a route known as the N85 National Highway will connect central Balochistan with the town of Hoshab in southwestern Balochistan province near the city of Turbat. This portion of roadway between Surab and Hoshab is 51% complete as of January 2016, and is expected to be completed in December 2016. =Construction of the M8 motorway= The towns of Hoshab and Gwadar are connected by a newly built portion of the M8 Motorway‚Äîthe Hoshab to Gwadar portion of the motorway was completed and inaugurated in February 2016 by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at a cost of approximately $124 million13 billion PKR = US$124,099,430.00 as of May 2016 Special economic zones The Western Alignment will be flanked by special economic zones along its route, with at least seven special economic zones planned to be established in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Construction In total, the CPEC project envisages re- construction of of road in Balochistan province alone as part of the Western Alignment. Of those of road, have already been rebuilt as of January 2016. Pakistan's Executive Committee of the National Economic Council approved construction of the Brahma Bahtar-Yarik Motorway in April 2016, and construction is expected to be completed within 36 months. Financing As part of the CPEC project, the Western Alignment is part of a package of approximately $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects throughout the country that are being developed by the Pakistani government. These projects will be financed by concessionary loans, with composite interest rates of 1.6%, after Pakistan successfully lobbied the Chinese government to reduce interest rates from an initial 3%. The loans are subsidised by the government of China, and are to be dispersed by the Exim Bank of China and the China Development Bank.

Some ethnographers, like Zelenin, affirm that Russians overall are more similar to Belarusians and to Ukrainians than southern Russians are to northern Russians. Russians in northern European Russia share moderate genetic similarities with Balts, Finnic peoples and Baltic Finns, who lived in modern north-central European Russia and were partly assimilated by the Slavs as the Slavs migrated northeastwards. Y-DNA Russians show the y-DNA R1a with frequencies ranging from 33.4% in North Russia to 49% in rest of Russia.Rosser et al. (2000)Tambets et al. (2004). R-M17 (and sometimes alternatively defined as R-M198), is particularly common in a large region extending from South Asia and Southern Siberia to Central Europe and Scandinavia.(Underhill 2009) Semino et al. (2000), \\"The Genetic Legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens sapiens in Extant Europeans: A Y Chromosome Perspective\\" The percentages of Y-chromosome markers vary in ethnic Russian populations by latitude and region. The top four Y-DNA haplogroups among the sample of 1228 Russians are: * Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA) ‚Äì 19.8% to 62.7%, with an average of 46.7% * Haplogroup I (Y-DNA) ‚Äì 0% to 26.8%, with an average of 17.6% (All regions), and 23.5% (Central and South Russia) * Haplogroup N (Y-DNA) ‚Äì 5.4% to 53.7%, with averages of 21.6% (All regions), and 10% (Central and South Russia) * Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA) ‚Äì 0% to 14%, with an average of 5.8% Eight Y chromosome haplogroup subclades, of West Eurasian origin, presented an average frequency greater than 1%, including R1a, N3, I1b, R1b, I1a, J2, N2, and E3b. All together, they account for >95% of the total Russian Y chromosomal pool. Of the 1228 samples, 11/1228 (0.9%) were classified up to the root level of haplogroups F and K. Only 9/1228 samples (0.7%) fell into haplogroups C, Q, and R2 which are specific to East and South Asian populations. mtDNA The mitochondrial gene pool of Russians are represented by mtDNA types belonging to typical West Eurasian groups. East Eurasian admixture was shown to be minimal and existed in low frequencies in the form of Haplogroup M. The same studies indicate West Eurasian haplogroups present at a frequency of 97.8% and 98.5% among a sample of 325 and 201 Russians respectively. A recent study, while precising that \\"the genetic distances from the Russians to the European language groups indicate that the gene pool of present-day Russians bears the influence of Slavic, Baltic, Finno-Ugric and, to a lesser extent, Germanic groups, as well as Iranian and Turkic groups\\", uphold the traditionally held genetic differentiation between Northern and Southern Russians, with the decisive ethnic element being the Finno-Ugric one, more important in the north, the southern population having substantial - generally unacknowledged in historical debates about Russian ethnogenesis - Germanic influence.

The catchment area of the Cap Rouge river extends into: * the regional county municipality (MRC) of La Jacques-Cartier Regional County Municipality: in the Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier; * the agglomeration of Quebec: L'Ancienne-Lorette, Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures and the city of Quebec. The Cap Rouge river valley is mainly served by the route 367 (route de Fossambault) which is perpendicular to the Saint-Laurent river, the \\"chemin du rang des Mines\\" (on the south shore from the top), route 138 (boulevard Wilfrid-Hamel), boulevard Auclair, avenue Le Gendre, boulevard de la Chaudi√®re, rue Provencher and rue Saint-F√©lix.Open Street Map - Accessed February 14, 2020. The surface of the Cap Rouge river (except the rapids areas) is generally frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March; safe circulation on the ice is generally done from the end of December to the beginning of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Geography  Rivi√®re du Cap Rouge The river begins on the slopes of Mount B√©lair and the Butte du Petit-Capsa, at the foothills of the Laurentian Mountains, and flows before ending in the Quebec City neighbourhood of Cap-Rouge as a left tributary of the Saint Lawrence River. It is also at the junction of those rivers that is located the archeological site of Charlesbourg-Royal, the earliest known French settlement in North America. Its watershed also encompasses parts of La Jacques-Cartier Regional County Municipality, L'Ancienne-Lorette, La Haute-Saint-Charles and Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures., where agricultural activities are found and which puts the river at risk of agricultural pollution. Measurements of ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrate and phosphorus were however all classified as \\"good\\" in 2016. The main neighboring hydrographic slopes are: * west: the Noire River (rivi√®re aux Pommes) and the Rivi√®re √† Matte, in the Neuville sector; * northwest: the Rivi√®re aux Pommes; * south: the slope of Saint-Augustin Lake and the Rivi√®re des Roches; * north: Notre-Dame brook, Lorette River, Saint-Charles River. On its course, the river crosses the districts: \\"Le Grand Village\\", \\"Quartier Laurentien\\", Jouvence and Cap-Rouge. At the end of the route, the river passes under the Tracel de Cap- Rouge, a raised railway bridge operated by the Canadian National. The river flows into the cove of Cap Rouge in the St. Lawrence River. In Quebec City, the municipal parks of Champigny, √âcores and Lorraine are also located on the banks of the river, in addition to several kilometers of trails. From its source, the Cap Rouge river flows over , with a drop of , according to the following segments: * eastwards in the forest zone, up to the bridge of Rang Petit-Capsa in Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures; * to the southeast, first in the forest zone, then in the agricultural zone by cutting the 4th range west road, the Canadian National railway, the 3rd range west, to Grand-Village stream (coming from the southwest); * towards the northeast by crossing the 3rd range road (west of the hamlet Le Grand-Village), the Fossambault road, by collecting the B√©land stream (coming from the north- west), the Yellow stream (coming from the northwest) and the B√©lair stream (coming from the north), and entering the territory of Sainte-Foy-Sillery-Cap-Rouge at the end of the segment, until the Lorette River (coming from the north); * to the east by forming large streamers where municipal parks are laid out, crossing the chemin du rang Saint-Denis, up to boulevard Wilfrid-Hamel (route 138); * towards the northeast in an urban area, making a curve to the south and forming several serpentines, crossing the Jean-Gauvin road and the Jules- Vernes avenue, until the highway 40; * to the south in an urban area, by cutting avenue Blaise-Pascal, rue Provancher, boulevard de la Chaudi√®re, rue Augustin-Bourbeau, the Canadian Pacific Railway bridge and rue Saint-F√©lix, to its mouth.OpenStreetMap for wikipedia - Rivi√®re du Cap Rouge - Retrieved on February 14, 2020  Toponymy  The toponym \\"Cap Rouge river\\" originates from Cape Rouge. The Cap Rouge river is sometimes called \\"Rivi√®re du Domaine\\" because it crosses the former seigneurial domain of Gaudarville. Explorer Jacques Cartier describes it for the first time. At high tide, it is navigable for more than a kilometer; Consequently, in the 19th century, the ferry service was abandoned and replaced by a swing bridge on Chemin du Roy. Thus, the boats and the barges can go up the course of the river to transport the cereals to the mill, the wood and the other goods of the inhabitants and the traders as well as the raw materials, the coal and the finished products of the manufacture of pottery of Cap-Rouge. In addition, its mouth allows the establishment of a small shipyard where at least two ships are built and launched. From the middle of the 18th century, the waters of the river also provided the driving force for operating mills for grinding grain and sawing wood.Source: Guide toponymique de Cap-Rouge, 1995.

An addition $1.26 billion will be lent by the China Exim Bank for the construction of the Havelian to Thakot portion of this stretch of roadway, to be dispersed as low-interest rate concessional loans. Construction works on the China-Pakistan Friendship Tunnels can be traced to 2013, when China began construction on a bypass of Attabad Lake with a combination of 5 km worth of tunnels, two large bridges, and 78 small bridges to bypass the lake which had been formed after a 2010 earthquake triggered massive landslides. The resulting landslides cut off both the Hunza River and Karakoram Highway resulting in the formation of the reservoir. Prior to completion of the bypass, all vehicular traffic had to be loaded onto barges to traverse the new reservoir. Construction of the tunnels began in 2012 and required 36 months for completion. The 24 km long series of bridges and tunnels was inaugurated on 15 September 2015 at a cost of $275 million and was hailed as a major accomplishment.http://www.dawn.com/news/1206911http://tribune.com.pk/story/956452/pm- inaugurates-tunnel-over-attabad-lake-in-g-b/ References Category:Roads in Pakistan Category:Highways in Pakistan Category:Lists of roads in Pakistan Category:China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor Category:Economic development in Pakistan Category:Infrastructure investment Category:Investment in Pakistan Category:Nawaz Sharif administration Category:Proposed infrastructure in Pakistan Category:Trade routes Category:China‚ÄìPakistan relations ","title":"Reconstruction of the Karakoram Highway"},{"id":"50535378","text":"Beto Mansur (born 1951) is a Brazilian politician and soybean farmer.

It covers of Amazon rainforest. Location The reserve lies between the Maicuru and Jari rivers on the border between the states of Par√° and Amap√°. It includes parts of the basins of the Maicuru, Paru and Jari rivers. It covers of Amazon biome. The park is mostly within the municipality of Almeirim (94.49%) with a small part in the municipality of Monte Alegre (5.51%). It is part of the mosaic of protected areas known as the Calha Norte do rio Amazonas. It adjoins the Tumucumaque Indigenous Park, Rio Paru d'Este Indigenous Territory, Tumucumaque Mountains National Park and Paru State Forest. Almost all the reserve is in the Paru-Jari basin formed by the Itapecuru, Ipitinga, Careparu, Paru and Jar√≠ rivers. The south of the reserve is in the Cuminapanema-Maicuru basin, formed by the Maicur√∫, Curu√°, Mami√°, Cuminapanema and Jauaru rivers. The total length of water courses in the reserve is about . The reserve is accessible only by small aeroplane through landing strips in four mining areas in the south-central portion and one in the north-central portion. History The reserve was created by state decree 2610 of 4 December 2006 with the objectives of preserving the natural environment and ecosystem, supporting scientific research and supporting environmental education. The conservation unit is fully protected. As a biological reserve the purpose is to provide full protection without human interference and allow only indirect use of the natural resources. Public access is prohibited except for educational purposes as defined by the management plan, and scientific research requires prior approval by the Par√° Secretary of State for the Environment (SEMA/PA). The reserve is in the Center of Guiana Endemism, which spans parts of Brazil, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana and Suriname. It may be considered a \\"mega reserve\\", aiming to protect a complete sample of species with the space needed to perpetuate themselves over the generations. The Management Plan was prepared by Conservation International with the assistance of the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi and the Institute of Man and Environment in the Amazon, and technical analysis from SEMA. The plan describes the physical, biological and socio-economic aspects of the landscape, and provides a full plan for managing it. The management plan was published and took effect in 2011. The management councils of the Maicuru Biological Reserve and the Gr√£o Par√° Ecological Station were formed on 6‚Äì7 March 2013. The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment The reserve has a tropical monsoon climate, with temperature between most of the year, high humidity and high rainfall. Average annual rainfall is , with a rainy season from December to June. From July to November monthly rainfall is . The reserve is almost all covered by dense submontane rainforest (98.24%), with some transition forest (0.96%) and Cerrado (0.04%). There is no record of human pressure in 98.5% of the reserve, but an area covering 1.5% of the reserve hot spots indicate medium pressure. The reserve contains various endemic and endangered species of flora and fauna. 88 species of fish have been recorded, 31 amphibians, 34 reptiles, 302 birds including the vulnerable crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) and 33 mammals including the endangered jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor) and giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). 88 species of ferns have been recorded and 306 of flowering plants.

The Communist International was the eponymous official magazine of the Moscow-based Communist International (Comintern). The publication was published from 1919 until 1943 in a multiplicity of languages including (but not limited to) Russian, German, English, and French. Issued irregularly, monthly, or semi- monthly depending upon the language and year, the magazine is regarded as a vital primary source for the study of the international Communist movement. Publication history =Establishment= The Communist International was a magazine launched at the March 1919 establishment of the Communist International in Moscow.Witold S. Sworakowski, \\"Communist International: New York, 1919-1940,\\" in Joseph R. Conlin (ed.). The American Radical Press, 1880-1960. Volume 1. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1974; pg. 218. The publication was intended as the official organ of the governing Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), headed by its president, Grigory Zinoviev, and was initially published in the four most commonly-used languages of the international Communist movement ‚Äî Russian, German, English, and French. The earliest issues of The Communist International were produced at the Comintern's offices at Smolny in Petrograd, with Zinoviev listed as the publication's editor.James W. Hulse, The Forming of the Communist International. Stanford, CA:Stanford University Press, 1964; pg. 27. The first issue saw print about two months following the conclusion of the Founding Congress of the Communist International, bearing a cover date of May 1919. The publication was originally planned to be a monthly, although by the end of 1919 it had slipped into a slightly slower and more irregular pace of production.Hulse, The Forming of the Communist International, pp. 27-28. The large-format magazine was intended to convey news, Marxist theory, strategic ideas, and official pronouncements of the so-called \\"World Party,\\" the Comintern to its supporters and sympathizers around the world, with a view to paving the way for world revolution. In the estimate of one historian, early issues of The Communist International were largely \\"a compendium of the arguments that Bolsheviks felt would win the working class to their cause.\\"The words are those of James W. Hulse in Hulse, The Forming of the Communist International, pg. 28. Comintern President Grigory Zinoviev was editor-in- chief of The Communist International at the time of its launch, as well as a leading contributor of content to the publication. The leading contributor to The Communist International during its inaugural year of 1919 was Grigory Zinoviev, who contributed 11 signed pieces to the publication.Hulse, The Forming of the Communist International, pg. 29. Vladimir Ulianov (N. Lenin) provided an additional 7 signed pieces for the seven issues of 1919, with French Comintern functionary Victor Serge adding more. The Communist International was hampered by the Allied blockade of Soviet Russia during its formative years, a situation which both restricted the receipt of timely news of the world revolutionary movement and which greatly constrained distribution of the printed publication. Owing to these circumstances, it was not effective as a transmission mechanism of timely news and information, a function fulfilled with greater success through the use of carefully focused radio- telegrams by the Comintern. These pioneer radio broadcasts were able to be transmitted through any physical blockade and heard in Sweden or Switzerland before being transmitted to the radical press in the United Kingdom, Germany, or elsewhere in Europe for newspaper reproduction. The glossy and illustrated Communist International was supplemented in its intended task of spreading official documents and pronouncements of the Comintern with the September 1921 launch of a second, less elaborate and more frequent publication ‚Äî the smaller-format International Press Correspondence (Inprecorr). =Publication schedule= Initial issues of The Communist International, known retrospectively as the \\"Old Series,\\" were first published in Russian with direct translation of content into German and English, although not every issue of the first dozen or so (issued during the years of the Allied blockade) made it to print in English. Beginning in the early 1920s production of the magazine in non-Russian editions was decentralized, with the English- language edition published in London and from there exported to the United States. As its availability increased, the magazine became required reading for Communist Party leaders around the world.Sworakowski, \\"Communist International: New York, 1919-1940,\\" pg. 221. A \\"New Series\\" of numbers for the London-produced English edition began in 1924. Through 1925 and into 1926 the magazine appeared regularly as a monthly in both Russian and English. However, in September 1926 the Russian edition moved to a weekly frequency, with the English edition only partially following the change, moving to a semi-monthly publication schedule in 1927.Sworakowski, \\"Communist International: New York, 1919-1940,\\" pg. 222. This twice-a-month frequency of the English edition was maintained through September 1935, when the magazine once again moved to a monthly schedule. Beginning in January 1934 parallel English-language editions of The Communist International were produced in London and New York City, initially with identical covers and pagination, but eventually with slightly different form and content. This situation changed dramatically at the end of 1939, following the summer signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, paving the way for war between Nazi Germany and the United Kingdom. =Termination and legacy= The British edition of the magazine was abruptly terminated in December 1939 although a modified American magazine was permitted to appear beginning in 1940, with mention of the magazine's official status removed from the banner in favor of the words, \\"Edited by Earl Browder.\\"Sworakowski, \\"Communist International: New York, 1919-1940,\\" pg. 223. The American edition continued to publish translations of a limited number of articles from the Russian edition but essentially served as a voice of the Communist Party, USA during its final years of existence. The American version of the publication continued to be produced in New York through 1943, at which time the Comintern was abruptly dissolved as a wartime gesture by Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union towards his capitalist allies in World War II and along with it the magazine by the same name. Regarded by historians as one of the most important primary sources relating to the international Communist movement, The Communist International was reissued in multiple hardcover volumes by the publisher Greenwood Press in 1968 as part of their series of reissues of periodicals of the American radical movement.

Medhurst's intention was to publish an abridged and cheaper dictionary that still contained all the 47,035 head characters from the (1716) Kangxi Dictionary, which Morrison's huge dictionary included. Medhurst reversed and revised into his Chinese-English dictionary in compiling the (1847-1848) English and Chinese Dictionary in Two Volumes. History Walter Henry Medhurst with Choo Tih Lang and a Malay student Walter Henry Medhurst and Robert Morrison were London Missionary Society (LMS) colleagues and friends. Both were professional printers, missionaries in China, and amateur lexicographers. In an 1817 letter, Morrison told the LMS directors that Medhurst had sent a promising specimen of small metal types, intended for magazines and tracts, and said the \\"qualifications and attention of Mr. M. give us great satisfaction\\" (Morrison 1839: 477). When Morrison was returning to China in 1826, he met with Medhurst in Java and they discussed their common work (Broomhall 1927: 172). Medhurst began compiling his dictionary in 1838, and wrote the LMS missionary printer William Ellis in Tahiti that he planned for his English-Chinese dictionary to include about 15,000 entry words and be \\"fit for every purpose of religion and science\\" (Su 1996: 227). As Medhurst explained in an 1841 letter to the LMS directors, his motivation to produce a Chinese and English dictionary came from Morrison's expensive one, which the missionary school's students could not afford. He said his \\"compendious and cheap\\" dictionary would contain \\"every character in Morrison's with all of the useful phrases, in one volume at the moderate cost of a few dollars\\" (Su 1996: 227-228). Medhurst's preface (1842: iii) says his purpose was to compile a \\"commodious, uniform, and comprehensive Dictionary\\" for English students of the Chinese language, comprising the 47,035 head characters in the (1716) Kangxi Dictionary (\\"Imperial Dictionary of Kang-he\\"), with the exception of those that supposedly have \\"either no sound or no meaning attached to them\\". Medhurst initially intended to compile a complete English-Chinese dictionary, but he found that the available materials were insufficient, and it was necessary for him to first create a Chinese-English dictionary, after which the work would be \\"comparatively easy to reverse the whole\\", and then add further English terms. Medhurst acknowledges taking phrases from Morrison's Chinese-English Dictionary and elsewhere, and adopting Morrison's widely used orthography, with the addition of aspirated consonants and pitch accents or tones, \\"as far as they were ascertainable\\".  Chinese- English content Sample page from Medhurst's Chinese and English Dictionary (1842: 1162) Medhurst printed, at his own expense, the Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing all the words in the Chinese imperial dictionary, arranged according to the radicals in 1842, at Parapattan Batavia, Dutch East Indies. The 648-page Volume I was completed by October 1842, and the 838-page Volume II was finished in May 1843, both were published in 600 copies. Its inexpensive printing enabled Medhurst to sell this bulky dictionary at only 10 Spanish dollars. As the title says, Medhurst collated his bilingual dictionary by radical-and-stroke sorting according to the 214 Kangxi radicals‚Äîthe same collation method used in Morrison's (1815-1823) Part I Chinese-English dictionary. Volume I comprises 648 pages of dictionary entries, from Radical 1 ‰∏Ä \\"one\\" to Radical 111 Áü¢ \\"arrow\\", and 50 pages of supplementary materials. The front matter includes an 11-page preface, 3-page list of the radicals, and the 5-page \\"Directions for discovering under what Radical any given character may be found\\"; the postface is a 29-page \\"List of Obsolete, Contracted, and Vulgar Characters, Not occurring in the foregoing Dictionary Volume I\\". Volume II comprises 838 pages of dictionary entries, from Radical 112 Áü≥ \\"stone\\" to Radical 214 Èæ† \\"flute\\", and a 28-page postface list of uncommon characters not in the volume. The preface briefly explains to dictionary users, particularly English-speaking students of the Chinese language, Medhurst's orthography for Standard Chinese phonology. The dictionary includes 20 initials, and Medhurst adopted Morrison's method of using apostrophes to represent the unaspirated- aspirated stop consonant pairs (listen to examples here). For instance (1842: v-vi), this description of the denti-alveolar consonants of unaspirated IPA // and aspirated // (Wade-Giles t and t'; pinyin d and t): \\"T, as in top; and t'h like the former, only with an aspirate between the t, and following vowel; not as the th in though, or in thing, but at the same letters in the words at home, supposing the initial a to be left out\\". The 55 finals are also explained, for example (1842: viii-ix), the rhotic coda or r-colored vowel //, which is difficult for many non-native speakers. \\"Urh, is a peculiar sound, something between the r and I, produced by a vibration of the lower part of the tongue against the inward region of the palate, near the entrance of the throat; it is something similar to the smooth sound of the r, heard in end of English words, as in liar.\\" Medhurst's dictionary annotates tones in terms of the classical four tones of Middle Chinese pronunciation used in rime dictionaries, instead of the four tones of Mandarin Chinese spoken by Medhurst (1 \\"high-level\\", 2 \\"rising\\", 3 \\"dipping\\", and 4 \\"falling\\") (1842: xiv-xv). Medhurst indicated p√≠ng Âπ≥ \\"level\\" tone as unmarked (a), sh«éng ‰∏ä \\"rising\\" tone with circumflex accent (√¢), q√π Âéª \\"departing\\" tone with grave accent (√†), and r√π ÂÖ•\\"entering\\" tone with acute accent (√°). As a result of using 17th-century Wufang yuanyin pronunciations, early Chinese-English dictionaries were much concerned with the \\"entering\\" tone, which had already ceased to exist in 19th- century Beijing pronunciation (Norman 1988: 173). Medhurst adopted Morrison's dictionary page layout with the page number centered between the character radical number and stroke number: Radical 162 Ëæµ or Ëæ∂ \\"walk\\" and the 9 additional strokes in sh«íu È¶ñ \\"head\\" (animated 12-stroke order for ÈÅì is shown here). English-Chinese content Sample page from Medhurst's English and Chinese Dictionary (1848: 1396) The Mission Press in Shanghai published Medhurst's English and Chinese dictionary in two volumes in 1847 and 1848, respectively. Publishing 600 copies of this 1,436-page dictionary was the largest work of the mission in its hand-press period. Owing to Medhurst's disappointment with the low quality results from combining typography and lithography to print Chinese characters for the Chinese and English Dictionary, he decided to use letterpress printing for the English and Chinese Dictionary, which required the cutting of small type. The LMS had previously used small type to print Christian translations and tracts that were smuggled into China, where they were forbidden. In Shanghai, Medhurst employed Chinese workers to punchcut moveable-type Chinese characters on blank shanks, \\"about 15,000 sorts, and nearly 100,000 individual types\\" that were required for the dictionary (Medhurst 1847: v). For the bilingual sources of his English- Chinese dictionary, Medhurst says he extracted \\"all that he thought serviceable from Morrison\\" and an anonymous Latin-Chinese manuscript dictionary‚Äîpresumably the Italian Franciscan Basilio Brollo's (1698) Dictionarium Sino-Latinum‚Äî\\"while he flatters himself that he has gone far beyond either of his predecessors, in the amount of foreign words adduced, and of expressions brought together to elucidate them.\\" (1847: iv). Volume I (1847) has a 6-page preface, 2-page summary of orthographic conventions, and the 766-page dictionary proper. The entries begin with \\"A, the letter a; the broad and open sound of this letter is expressed by ‰∫û a [y√†], or Èòø a [ƒÅ].\\" and end with \\"KORAN, the Mahomedans, call the Koran Â§©Á∂ì t'h√´en king [tiƒÅnjƒ´ng].\\" Volume II (1848) of Medhurst's English-Chinese dictionary comprises 669 pages. The entries go from \\"LABEL, Â∏ñ t'√´ƒï [ti√®]; the label of a book, Ê™¢ k√´en [ji«én].\\" To \\"ZONE, Â∏∂ ta√© [d√†i], ÊùüËÖ∞‰πãÂ∏∂ sh«î yaou che ta√© [sh√πyƒÅo zhƒ´ d√†i], ËÖ∞Â∏∂ yaou ta√© [yƒÅod√†i], Âú∞ÁêÉÈÅì t√© k'h√™u ta√≥u [d√¨qi√∫d√†o].\\" The sample page (to the right) contains Medhurst's dictionary entry for WAY. > Way.

(1848: 1396) The first part of the WAY headword gives 16 translation equivalents of Chinese words meaning \\"way\\". This illustrates how one single English headword can have ten or more Chinese translation equivalents, which Medhurst ascribes to either \\"the richness of the Chinese language, in certain particulars\\", or to \\"the inability of the compiler (from want of time and skill) to discover the slight shades of meaning that exist among them\\" (1847: iii). Most of these equivalents are common terms, such as ÈÅì ta√≥u (d√†o \\"way; road; path), Ë∑Ø lo√≥ (l√π \\"road; path; way\\"), and ÈÄî t'ho√¥ (t√∫ \\"road; route; way\\") (given in Morrison's dictionary. 1822b: 369), but some are obscure classical Chinese terms, such as d«êg√© ÂùªÈñ£, which the Kangxi zidian (s.v., Èñ£) notes was the name of a road mentioned in commentaries to the Rites of Zhou (ÈáéÂª¨Ê∞è). The second part of the WAY headword gives translations of 11 usage examples, for instance, \\"public way, Â§ßË∑Ø t√° lo√≥ , ÂÆòË∑Ø kwan lo√≥\\" (d√†l√π \\"big street; main road; highway\\" and guƒÅnl√π \\"government-financed road; public road\\", respectively). Reception Scholars have expressed diverse opinions of Walter Henry Medhurst's Chinese- English and English-Chinese dictionaries. The first published evaluation of the (1842-1843) Chinese and English Dictionary was an anonymous 1843 review in The Chinese Repository, which was a Protestant missionary periodical published in Canton. On the one hand, the reviewer praises the dictionary's portability and price, \\"two octavo volumes containing 1500 pages for ten dollars\\", but on the other, expresses regret that Medhurst \\"has said so little on the subject of tones\\" other than \\"that he considers them of paramount importance\\" (Anon 1843: 499). Based upon comparison of the entries under Radical 46 Â±± \\"mountain\\" in Morrison's and Medhurst's Chinese-English dictionaries, the reviewer said, \\"If Mr. Medhurst does not improve upon himself, he improves vastly upon Dr. Morrison\\" (Anon 1943: 497). The next major Chinese-English dictionary after Medhurst's was the American sinologist and missionary Samuel Wells Williams's (1874) A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language. The preface says that although many similar Chinese-English dictionaries by Medhurst, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and others were published in small numbers, they became \\"very scarce, while the number of students has increased tenfold\\", and learners of Chinese relied on reprints of Morrison's dictionary (1874: v). Williams explicitly identified \\"Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien\\" as a more important source for his own work than Morrison's dictionary (1874: vi). The preface to the British diplomat and sinologist Herbert Giles's A Chinese-English Dictionary (1892: vii-viii) praised Morrison as \\"the great pioneer\\" of Chinese and English lexicography, but criticized his failure to mark aspiration. He said Medhurst \\"attempted aspirates, but omitted many and wrongly inserted others\\". Huiling Yang, a researcher at Beijing Foreign Studies University, expresses surprise that the Chinese and English Dictionary, which Medhurst claimed to be his translation based on Kangxi zidian, \\"is in fact just an abbreviated and edited copy of Morrison‚Äôs, a plagiarism rather than an original compilation\\" (2014: 317-318).

The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.  Background  = Political climate = The strike and subsequent riot followed in a tradition of mass militant activity which preceded it by decades. Ethno-religious conflict, embodied by struggles between Orangemen and Irish Catholics, began in the 1840s and involved repeated episodes of violence and intimidation, with Orangemen conducting armed marches through Irish neighbourhoods for decades. This conflict strengthened ethnic and religious allegiances, especially between Protestant workers and their Protestant employers. Warning shocks of the conflict to come were indicated by repeated episodes of crowd violence starting in the early 1900s, often revolving around holidays such as New Year's Eve, which would set a tone of decisive mass action on the part of ordinary people living in Saint John. = Street railway = Starting in 1866, public transit consisted of horse-drawn cars which mostly funneled traffic from the ocean to ferries on the Saint John River. The electric trolley system in Saint John made its debut in 1893 and the fledgling St. John Railway Company was quickly bought by a Montr√©al-based consortium which included the railway magnates W.C. Van Horne, Richard B. Angus, and Thomas G. Shaughnessy, only a year after the Canadian Pacific \\"Short Line\\" had connected Montr√©al to Saint John; they invested the then-substantial sum of $92,000 into the project, seen also as an investment in Saint John as a major Maritime winter port. Positive public opinion on the trolley system quickly soured, with citizens complaining of infrequent service and overcrowded cars. The company delayed expansion of the system to Saint John's West Side, with contemporary critics claiming it as an issue of class, arguing that \\"the railway clings to the streets where the nickels are the thickest.\\" Bearing this out, the city refused to sponsor workingmen's tickets (then common in other street railways in Canada), cementing the trolley as a service inaccessible to many. By 1902, the company was belatedly forestalling attempts at a municipally-run trolley service by laying track along Douglas Avenue, followed by street service throughout the West Side. This issue acted as a microcosm of political relations in the province; the Tory opposition, led by J. Douglas Hazen (a Saint John native), endorsed a municipal trolley service, while the ruling Liberal government instead placed the railway in charge of snow removal and street repair along its route, making a great deal of public infrastructure maintenance contingent on the railway company's goodwill. Following the Tory victory in the 1908 provincial election, a Board of Public Utility Commissioners was formed and given the ability to fine utility companies for violating utility regulations, raising the stakes of the struggle. A warning sign appeared on New Year's Eve in 1910, when 500-600 people vandalized a streetcar. In 1913, with new suburban lines seemingly not forthcoming, the city introduced bills to charter a rival railway company. Further attempts by the city to purchase the railway failed, and the company executives issued even more stock to finance moderate expansions amid complaints of overcrowding in the downtown and the inaccessibility of suburbs. By then, it had come under the control of Colonel Hugh H. McLean (a prominent Orangeman and maritime lawyer, known for representing Canadian Pacific and Bank of Montreal interests), F.R. Taylor (a member of his law firm), Senator W.H. Thorne (a prominent merchant), and James Manchester (part-owner of the leading wholesaler in the Maritimes). H.M. Hopper was the general manager of the company. = Railway union = In the midst of this crisis appeared Local 663 of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees, formed on May Day 1914. Saint John was no stranger to unions, but a lack of heavy industrialization had left the city mostly a bastion of old-style craft unions, with the more socialist-influenced industrial unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World more likely to exist in major centres such as Toronto or Montr√©al, or in the resource industries in Northern Ontario, Qu√©bec, and the West. Unions would become more common by the early 1910s, however, with longshoremen and other waterfront workers, building trades, printers, cigar-makers, and tailors all forming unions, along with a Saint John Trades and Labour Council being founded, which by 1913 would represent 4,000 workers, or about 40% of the labour force of Saint John. This renewed class consciousness and class-based form of organization helped to weaken the ethnic and religious ties which bound working-class Catholics and Protestants to the company owners and divided them against each other, something which would set the stage for the antagonism to follow. The company reception to the formation of the eighty-member Local 663 was abrupt and decisive, with ten- year employee and local union president Fred Ramsey being summarily fired for abandoning his trolley car to go into a saloon, a charge he denied; and the company refusing to negotiate with the union's business agent. The union made a filing under the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act to challenge Ramsay's firing and threatening a strike if the company did not negotiate. In the subsequent hearing, Ramsey's coworkers and the saloon keeper all denied that he had entered the saloon, and a company inspector failed to find evidence of any wrongdoing on Ramsey's part. Only a detective hired by the company was left claiming Ramsey's guilt. In the investigation, three trolley workers claimed harassment by company management over the union, bolstering the union's position. The investigation concluded by ruling that Ramsey would be re-hired by the company and instructing the company to negotiate with the union leadership. Instead, the company refused to re-hire Ramsey or negotiate with the union. It also instated new, very strict employee regulations, then fired more and more workers for claimed violation of them: eight men on July 18, then three on July 20, all prominent union members who were replaced with non-union workers. At 3 on July 22, the union declared a strike.  Strike  The union began with pickets at the car barns where the trolleys were stored overnight, which prevented two-thirds of the trolley cars from leaving the barns. Meanwhile, the company had hired fifty professional strikebreakers from a Montr√©al agency and the mayor of Saint John swore in six \\"special\\" police officers. As the day went on, many of the non-union trolley operators simply abandoned their cars in the street and joined the strikers. The union also made the tactical decision to hire a horse-drawn bus to provide service to Saint John inhabitants who were inconvenienced from the strike, winning public support and denying the company fares in the same act. By the afternoon of July 22, crowds of bystanders had gathered to alternately cheer on the strikers and jeer at scabs. By the evening, a crowd of 2000 people had gathered to cheer on the strikers, which swelled to 7-8000 in the space of a few hours. On July 23, fifteen strikebreakers arrived from Montr√©al, but union business agent Sidney Mosher warned that the union had no ability to control the crowd if it turned violent. Numerous incidents occurred of citizens blocking tracks or otherwise delaying trolleys throughout the day. The situation peaked when a mob of up to 10,000 people tossed small stones at passing trolleys in King Square, with the crowd defending itself from police attacks, disarming one policeman when he fired on them with his revolver. The street railway workers maintained strict discipline and were not involved in the fight. The aftermath of the riot, photographed the next morning. Mayor Frink had read the Riot Act from the stone fountain in the bottom left. By 9, Mayor James Frink had made the decision to read the Riot Act to the crowd, which ignored him. The local police immediately requested backup in the form of a detachment of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, who charged the crowd on horseback, beating the crowd with their ceremonial swords. Again, the crowd repulsed this attack, with injuries among the crowd and dragoons both, with the Globe later referring to the attack as \\"vicious\\". Incensed, the crowd overturned nearby trolley cars, then proceeded to the headquarters of the St. John Railway Company, smashing windows and shutting down the city's electrical generators. The emboldened crowd advanced to the car sheds to set fire to them, but were driven off by armed Pinkerton and Thiel strikebreakers, who fired on the crowd. Meanwhile, the mayor called up five hundred militiamen who stood guard overnight, though by then the crowd had dispersed. By evening, however, crowds had reappeared and hampered trolley services from operating again, with stones and other projectiles thrown and the non-union trolley crews abandoning their cars to be towed back to their car barns under militia protection. The deadlock was broken by Fred Ramsey's resignation as union president in exchange for accepting a job with the city public works department, a deal negotiated between him and John B.M. Baxter, the city recorder, who acted as an informal negotiator. In exchange, the company agreed to re-hire the fired workers and to guarantee them a right of appeal against dismissals in the future, with an agreement ratified by 11:30 that night.  Aftermath  Saint John, seen as a conservative town with a highly established social order, was wracked with controversy as a result of the rioting. Newspapers were indignant about the loss of public order. Politicians, conscious of the unpopularity of the railway company, refused to pay for the damages incurred (a total of $15,560) by rioters. Additionally, almost all of the rioters escaped with minor injuries, and those who were arrested mostly had their charges dismissed. All were soon distracted by the First World War, which quickly buried memories of the strike and riot. The railway company was bought by a local syndicate in 1917, its profitability having been damaged by wartime inflation of labour and materials costs.

Holmboe & Lafferty grew to become to most prominent architectural firm in the Clarksburg region, but was dissolved in 1920, soon after the end of World War I.

History Its first official meeting was held on 13 March 1874 at University College London, and by the next year membership had reached 500 members. Members included prominent names of the day such as Eleanor Marx,Gabriel, Mary. Love and Capital: Karl and Jenny Marx. New York: Little Brown. 2011. p467 George Bernard Shaw, James Halliwell-Phillipps, Richard Green Moulton, and Edward Dowden. In its early years, it hosted public paper discussions and published both Proceedings and Transactions as the official record of the society. The Society also devoted a significant portion of its energies to determining the exact chronology of Shakespeare's plays; Furnivall believed that Shakespeare's works had to be studied in the order they were written to \\"get at a right understanding of his mind.\\" The Society was disrupted several times by conflicts between Furnivall and other members. Frederick Gard Fleay, an early member, resigned during the Society's first year after an argument with Furnivall, and a number of members left the society in the 1880s following a protracted argument between Furnivall and Algernon Charles Swinburne.

New Wrinkle, Inc., 342 U.S. 371 (1952),. is a 1952 Supreme Court decision in which the Court held that a claim of conspiracy to fix uniform minimum prices and to eliminate competition throughout substantially all of the wrinkle finish industry of the United States by means of patent license agreements was, if proved, a violation of ¬ß 1 of the Sherman Act. That one of the defendants, a patent-holding company, abstained from manufacturing activities, did not ship goods in commerce, and engaged solely in patent licensing did not insulate its activity from ¬ß 1\\\\. Making these license contracts for the purpose of regulating distribution and fixing prices of commodities in interstate commerce is subject to the Sherman Act, even though the isolated act of contracting for the licenses occurs within a single state. Patents give no protection from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act when the patent licensing agreements are used to restrain interstate commerce and fix prices of goods shipped in commerce. Background Before and during 1937, two paint companies, Kay & Ess and Chadeloid Chemical Co., were in patent litigation with each other. Each company claimed that it controlled the basic patents on wrinkle finish,Wrinkle‚Äìfinish enamels, varnishes, and paints are manufactured in a manner such that, when they are applied to metal or another material and allowed to dry, they form a hard, wrinkled surface on the metal or other material. The patents cover methods and chemicals for making such enamels, varnishes and paints. 342 U.S. at 372 n.3. and each company contended that the patents of the other could not be used without infringing its own patents. In November 1937 they decided to settle the litigation by forming a new, jointly‚Äìowned company, New Wrinkle, to which they assigned their patents. They agreed that they would license the wrinkle‚Äìfinish industry to make and sell at fixed prices. Kay & Ess and Chadeloid then worked together to induce all manufacturers of wrinkle finish products to accept the price-fixing patent licenses from New Wrinkle. The prospective licensees were assured that the other manufacturers were being dealt with on the same basis \\"in order to establish minimum prices throughout the industry.\\" By September 1938 the leading manufacturing companies and some 200 other manufacturers‚Äîsubstantially all manufacturers of wrinkle finishes in the United States‚Äîheld nearly identical ten-year extendable license agreements from New Wrinkle, fixing prices. These license agreements required that a licensee observe in all sales of products covered by the licensed patents a schedule of minimum prices, discounts, and selling terms. Unlike its organizers, Kay & Ess and Chadeloid, New Wrinkle does not manufacture and sell the patented products. It just owns and licenses the patents.342 U.S. at 373‚Äì76. The United States sued Kay & Ess, Chadeloid, and New Wrinkle in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, for conspiring to fix uniform minimum prices and to eliminate competition throughout the wrinkle‚Äìfinish industry, in violation of ¬ß 1 of the Sherman Act. The defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the district court granted without issuing any opinion. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court. Ruling of the Supreme Court Justice Reed delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court Justice Stanley Reed delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court.Justice Tom C. Clark, who had been Attorney General when the case was filed, recused himself. Because New Wrinkle, unlike Kay & Ess and Chadeloid, did not manufacture or sell the patented products, and just owned and licensed the pooled patents, New Wrinkle contended that it is not engaged in trade or commerce‚Äîand thus could not be held liable for restraining trade and commerce under ¬ß 1 of the Sherman Act. \\"These contentions leave out of consideration,\\" the Court responded, the allegations that \\"the use of patent licenses as an essential part of the plan to restrain trade, a trade in enamels, varnishes, and paints that is alleged to be and obviously is interstate in character.\\" Pointing to the price-fixing provisions of the licenses, the Court said that it is \\"beyond question that this making of license contracts for the purpose of regulating distribution and fixing prices of commodities in interstate commerce is subject to the Sherman Act, even though the isolated act of contracting for the licenses is wholly within a single state.\\"342 U.S. at 377. New Wrinkle next argued that the doctrine of United States v. General Electric Co..‚Äîthe 1926 GE case‚Äîimmunized the price fixing from the antitrust laws. The Court distinguished the GE case from the case at bar: In the GE case, a patentee licensed a single other manufacturer to make and sell the patented product with a price limitation controlled by the patentee. In the present case, a patentee, acting in concert with all members of an industry, issued substantially identical licenses to all members of the industry under the terms of which the industry is completely regimented in order to organize the industry and stabilize prices. The Court said the case was indistinguishable from United States v. Line Material Co.,. and United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,. which held such conduct illegal.342 U.S. at 380. Subsequent developments In Newburgh Moire Co. v. Superior Moire Co., the Third Circuit held that price-fixing clauses in multiple patent licenses violated the Sherman Act. Newburgh entered into licensing agreements with three of the five manufacturers in the moire finish industry, containing price-fixing clauses. The court held that the fact that there was more than one price-fixing license (in contrast to the single such license in the General Electric case) made the licenses fall outside the range of protected behavior that the General Electric case allowed. The Third Circuit explained: > At worst, we think that the patent laws were not intended to empower a > patentee to grant a plurality of licenses, each containing provisions fixing > the price at which the licensee might sell the product or process . . . and > that, if a plurality of licenses are granted, such provisions therein are > prohibited by the antitrust laws. The course pursued by Newburgh in the case > at bar transcends the authority of the General Electric decision.237 F.2d at > 293-94. Despite the differences in the fact patterns (multiple licenses, pooling, cross-licensing), the court said it saw no difference between the General Electric and New Wrinkle cases, so that the latter must be regarded as overruling the former: \\"We can find no very strong basis for distinguishing between General Electric and New Wrinkle. The explanation probably lies more in history than in logic, for history is an untidy housekeeper.\\"237 F.2d at 293 References External links * Category:United States antitrust law Category:United States patent case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Vinson Court Category:1952 in United States case law ","title":"United States v.

In 1964, The GrEEK Campus was formed by former president Dr. Thomas A. Bartlett of the American University in Cairo (AUC). When AUC began its relocation to another larger campus on the outskirts of Cairo ‚Äì and in the outcome of the events of June 2013 ‚Äì as the campus was left virtually abandoned since Tahrir 2011, Ahmed El Alfi decided to take over The Greek Campus and bring it back to life ‚Äì more than it ever has been.

It was more about building a community/an ecosystem from the ground up into a campus for techpreneurs, enthusiasts and creative individuals to meet, exchange and showcase their ideas and work together towards new technology and innovation that would ultimately benefit Egypt and the world.  Foundation  The GrEEK Campus was a part of American University for 50 years. In 2013, former president of AUC Lisa Anderson signed an agreement with Tahrir Alley Technology Park, a Cairo-based company, who leased the property to run a Technology Park.

Salazar was El Paso's second Hispanic mayor, following Raymond Telles, who had previously held the office from 1957 to 1961. Biography Salazar was born in El Paso, Texas, in 1931 to Guadalupe Chaparro (Raul) and Reynaldo Salazar. He was one of four children, including a brother, Frank Salazar Sr., and two sisters, Olga and Alice. He graduated from El Paso High School in 1949, enlisted in the United States Navy for four years, and served in the Korean War. During the 1950s, Salazar enrolled in Texas Western College (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso) during the 1950s, and graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in accounting in 1957. He was a certified public accountant by profession. In 1977, Salazar was elected Mayor of El Paso, defeating incumbent Mayor Don Henderson. He served in office for one term from 1977 to 1979. He oversaw the construction of the new, present-day El Paso City Hall, which was constructed near Union Plaza. As mayor, Salazar opposed a proposed border fence along the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. In \\"The Cactus Curtain\\", an article published in Texas Monthly in 1977, explained his opposition to the barrier, telling the magazine, \\"We don't want a Berlin Wall between our two cities...Besides, a seventeen-mile fence won‚Äôt keep illegal aliens out. They‚Äôll just go to the end of the fence and come in around it. If the fence runs the entire two thousand miles from Chula Vista to Brownsville, they'll just cut holes in it. There's no way a barrier like that can be maintained without spending millions and millions of dollars. And the only result is going to be increased hostilities between neighbors.\\" Salazar ran for a second term, but was defeated for re-election by Tom Westfall in the 1979 mayoral election. he largely stayed out of local politics until the late 1990s, when he made an unsuccessful run for El Paso County judge. In 2013, Salazar filed a lawsuit to block the demolition of the former City Hall, which was slated to be torn down to construct Southwest University Park, a minor league baseball stadium. In the lawsuit, which was filed against city Reps. Cortney Niland and Steve Ortega and then-City Manager Joyce Wilson, Salazar alleged that the officials had misused public funds to build the new stadium. Salazar also requested a review of city Rep. Ortega's income taxes for the prior three years. His lawsuit was later dismissed and the old City Hall was imploded in April 2013. Ray Salazar died from heart complications on April 27, 2016, at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife of 61 years, Dolores Salazar, and their seven children - Debra Kosich, Susan Bullard, Michael Salazar, Mark Salazar, Linda King, Matthew Salazar and Martin Salazar; as well as his two sisters. His funeral was held at St. Patrick Cathedral in El Paso, with burial at Fort Bliss National Cemetery. Salazar died less than one month after the passing of another former El Paso Mayor, Ralph Seitsinger, in March 2016 at the age of 100.

The first season was the last animated project of Arc Productions before it was absorbed into Jam Filled Toronto in August 2016. Plot A young boy named Rusty Rivets uses his knowledge of engineering to repurpose machine parts and create gadgets. He lives in the city of Sparkton Hills along with his friend Ruby Ramirez, a robotic tyrannosaurid named Botasaur, and a group of smaller robots known as the Bits. The show highlights a variety of concepts related to basic science and technology. Rusty uses the recurring catch phrase \\"modify, customize, Rustify\\" when personalizing inventions.

He completed his post graduation in management from IIM Calcutta. He received his PhD from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, United States. Career He started his professional career in the development sector as an active intervener in the processes of social change in rural areas of India. While working with villagers on educational training, he observed the power of new learning opportunities in the hands of those who have otherwise been denied such access. He questioned the methodology of an objective, scientific system in transforming social realities and began experimenting with the idea of a bottom-up acquisitive system, thereby discovering a new faith. His work was labeled as unscientific, and some wondered if it served only to further political ideology. Others would look at it merely as a development tool. He founded the Society for Participatory Research in Asia PRIA as a vehicle to strengthen learning opportunities at the grassroots level and to articulate knowledge for wider social influence, in 1982. He developed participatory training, monitoring, and evaluation methodologies supported by and to enhance adult learning and community knowledge. His contributions revolve around issues of participatory research, advocating for people centered development, policy reform and networking in India, South-Asia and beyond. He has advocated for a self-reliant, autonomous and competent voluntary sector in India and abroad.

An Estonian-language drama school was set up in Tallinn in 1920 by Paul Sepp, and from this the Estonian Drama Theatre was formed in 1924. It was originally called the Drama Studio Theatre and rented the stage of the German theatre. In 1939 the theatre however purchased the building and has been housed there ever since. The theatre was renamed the Estonian Drama Theatre in 1937. During the Soviet occupation the theatre was called the Viktor Kingissepp Tallinn National Drama Theatre but it reverted to its old name in 1989, prior to Estonia's re-gained independence. Theatre The theatre today fulfills the role of an Estonian national theatre. It has three stages, with 436, 170 and 70 seats each. Both classical plays and new productions, including experimental plays, are staged at the theatre. Since it was founded, the Estonian Drama Theatre has cooperated with and staged plays by playwrights such as Hugo Raudsepp, August Kitzberg, Eduard Vilde, Anton Hansen Tammsaare, Mats Traat, Jaan Kross and Oskar Luts. During the 1980s, the theatre took on a political role as it staged plays with themes critical to the Soviet occupation and in favour of Estonian independence by writers like Jaan Kruusvall and Rein Saluri.

The mine was initially owned by a Los Angeles company known as Blue Diamond, which began mining the land in 1925. An on-site processing plant was added in 1941, followed a year later by the construction of a nearby company town, known as Blue Diamond, Nevada. The mine was eventually sold to James Hardie Gypsum, which expanded operations in 1998. BPB took over the gypsum factory a few years later, and developer Jim Rhodes purchased 2,400 acres in 2003. History In 1924, the Blue Diamond company of Los Angeles purchased a 1,000-acre site for $75,000, and began mining its large deposit of gypsum. The site posed various obstacles for the development of a mining operation, including cost. There were no roads leading to the area, and there was no railroad connection leading to the Union Pacific line in nearby Arden, Nevada. A railroad spur line was built to connect the mine to Arden, located about 11 miles southeast. Quarry equipment and the construction of employee housing put the total project cost at more than $1 million. The mine opened in 1925. The initial production capacity was approximately 200 tons per day, a figure that was gradually increased with equipment improvements. Open-pit and underground mining took place at the site. In 1941, Blue Diamond added a processing plant on-site for the gypsum, which had previously been processed in Los Angeles. Gypsum was mined at the top of Blue Diamond Hill and was transported by tram to the area below, where it was processed. The Blue Diamond Corporation subsequently built a company town in 1942, named Blue Diamond, Nevada. The mine, plant, and mill were expanded over the next decade. As of 1954, it had 325 employees. Gypsum is extracted from the upper portion of the Permian Kaibab Formation. The gypsum layer is on the westward slope of Blue Diamond Hill. =Ownership changes= BPB's gypsum operation in 2007 James Hardie Gypsum eventually purchased the mine, and expanded operations there in 1998. It had 150 employees by the end of the decade. In 1999, James Hardie put 2,700 acres of its mine land up for sale, at a price of $45 million. In 2002, BPB agreed to purchase James Hardie's gypsum factory, located at the bottom of Blue Diamond Hill. Meanwhile, John Laing Homes was planning a purchase of approximately 2,000 acres atop Blue Diamond Hill, part of James Hardie's mining operation. John Laing planned to build a residential community on the land, but later withdrew its proposal amid opposition. In 2003, developer Jim Rhodes purchased 2,400 acres from James Hardie. Rhodes also intended to develop a residential project on the land, and he launched tours of the mining operation hoping to win public support for the project. Rhodes argued that housing would be a better use of the land, rather than the continuation of mining. Rhodes' mining operation closed in 2005. As of 2008, BPB operated a processing plant at Blue Diamond Hill, for gypsum that was shipped in from Arizona. Rhodes' residential project received opposition, and he resumed gypsum mining on his property around 2011, while still trying to get the housing proposal approved. As of 2014, he was selling approximately 1 million tons of gypsum each year through his company, Gypsum Resources. In 2018, Rhodes sold 1,375 acres in mining claims to a Denver company. Gypsum Resources filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019.

The more general Japanese term for the beginning of the game is Â∫èÁõ§ joban. A j≈çseki () is the especially recommended sequence of moves for a given opening that was considered balanced play at one point in time for both sides by professional players. (However, some josekis have become outdated when they are reevaluated to no longer give balanced play.) Josekis also typically include commentary about the possible reasons to deviations from the joseki especially regarding blunders. Note that not all openings have josekis. For example, trap openings like Demon Slayer, while they may have standard moves, are considered to favor one player and, thus, are not balanced play. Introduction The very first opening moves in most games are pawn pushes. In particular, most games start with two types of pawn pushes. A player can move the rook pawn forward (P-26) as the first type of pawn push, or, more commonly, advance the seventh file pawn to open the bishop's diagonal for attacking (P-76) as the second type of pawn push. Strategically, these two moves aim to activate the two most powerful pieces in the game. Furthermore, these two types of pawn pushes are the most common moves for both Black and White (which would be 1..P-84 and 1..P-34). Thus, almost all games (over 90%) will start with the one of the four possible combinations of these two pawn push types (see adjacent diagrams).(Âä†Ëó§ [Kat≈ç] 1970: 20‚Äì22) With a bishop diagonal first move (P-76 or P-34), it's common to exchange bishops by having one capture the other (although not necessarily at the beginning of the opening). This allows each player to put their newly captured bishop into play anywhere on the board on their next move although care must be taken to avoid weaknesses in defense which may allow for a bishop drop from their opponent. However, it is not advantageous to exchange bishops if your opponent has a better defensive setup or more lines of attack. Moreover, making a bishop exchange constitutes tempo loss, so it is not advised without a good reason. Opening the bishop diagonal as the first move is the most flexible first move, which leads to the largest number of opening possibilities. Additionally, although P-76 and P-34 may occur as the first two moves allowing for a bishop trade off, it is always possible that either Black or White can prevent an early bishop exchange by closing their bishop diagonal with a subsequent pawn push ‚Äì P-66 for Black or P-44 for White. With the rook pawn first move (P-26 or P-84), the intention is usually to keep the rook on its initial file on the player's right side of the board and develop an attack on this side with support from the rook. Compared with opening the bishop diagonal for the first move, a rook pawn push limits the range of opening possibilities for the player and for their opponent. Additionally, it signals to their opponent that they will be playing against a Static Rook position (see below for the definition of Static Rook). Thus, 1. P-26 is comparatively more informative of a player's planned strategy. A third common first move is to push the central pawn (P-56). However, P-56 is an order of magnitude less common than the other P-76 and P-26 moves. With the central pawn push first move, the player most often is preparing to move their rook to the central fifth file in order to support this central pawn push (See: Central Rook). However, other configurations (such as Opposing Rook) are possible. Many common opening attacks involve advancing a silver and ideally pawns, protected by other pieces. Because silvers have more possibilities for retreat, silvers are generally considered superior as attacking pieces in the opening and middle game while golds better defend their sides and are superior as defensive pieces. It is common practice to defend the king with three generals, two golds and a silver. Because defense is so important, and because shogi pieces are relatively slow movers, the opening game tends to be much longer in shogi than in western chess, commonly with a dozen or more moves to shore up defenses before the initial attack is made. As part of the defense, typically the king is moved to the side in a castle with three generals. Leaving a king on its original square (Â±ÖÁéâ igyoku \\"sitting king\\") may be a particularly dangerous position. Over the past 400 years, Japanese professional players have invented various j≈çseki (ÂÆöË∑°), which determine moves and sequences which are thought to be the best for a particular situation. It also covers a branch of different variations within an intricate strategy, including alternative options and the certain consequences that some moves may bring. Shogi openings are generally slower than that of western chess, due to the larger board and less mobile pieces. But since a quick offense will leave a player's home territory open to drop attacks as soon as pieces are exchanged, one aim of the opening is to build up defenses for the king. (See: Castle.) Classification =Rook position= Openings for even games are traditionally classified by the position of a player's rook ‚Äì specifically whether it remains on its starting square or moves to a different square. In this binary classification, Static Rook (Â±ÖÈ£õËªä ibisha) openings are where the offense is supported by the rook in its original position. Ranging Rook (ÊåØ„ÇäÈ£õËªä furibisha) openings are where the rook moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there, typically with the idea of allowing the opponent to attack while arranging a better defense and aiming for a counterattack. Before the modern era, shogi openings were categorized by both the position of the rook (whether Static Rook or not) and by the position of bishop (whether Static Bishop or not). Openings are further subcategorized based on the opening each player chooses: # Double Static Rook (Áõ∏Â±ÖÈ£õËªä aiibisha or ‰∏°Â±ÖÈ£õËªä) [that is, Black Static Rook vs White Static Rook] # Static Rook vs Ranging Rook (Â±ÖÈ£õËªäÂØæÊåØ„ÇäÈ£õËªä ibisha tai furibisha) # Ranging Rook vs Static Rook (ÊåØ„ÇäÈ£õËªäÂØæÂ±ÖÈ£õËªä furibisha tai ibisha) # Double Ranging Rook (Áõ∏ÊåØ„ÇäÈ£õËªä aifuribisha) Interaction with castles As the most powerful piece on the board, the rook invites attack, and in most cases, especially for inexperienced players, it is a good idea to keep the king well away from the rook. Relatedly, the Static vs Ranging classification corresponds to castle development: static rook positions with the rook on the right side of the board tend to have castles on the left side of the board while ranging rook positions tend to have castles on the right side. The adjacent diagram shows a Static Rook vs Ranging Rook game. Here Black (the first move player on the bottom of the diagram indicated with (‚òó) is playing Bear-in-the-hole Static Rook with their rook remaining on its starting square and an Bear-in-the-hole castle on the left side of their board while White (‚òñ) is playing Central Rook (a Ranging Rook position) in which their rook has moved to the central fifth file and their king placed in a Kimura Mino castle on the right side of their board. Certain castles are traditionally thought to be more appropriate for particular Black/White opening combinations. For example, Fortress castle is a strong defense against an opponent's headlong Static Rook attacks, but it is a weaker choice for a Ranging Rook opponent as the Fortress does not provide as much defense against side attacks (since the gold on 78 is only defended by the king), which are likely to occur when the Ranging Rook player's rook breaks through the right side of Black's camp. Static Rook Static Rook openings usually have the player's rook at its start position, which is second file (28 square) for Black and the eighth file (82 square) for White. Most Static Rook openings coincide with a castle development on the player's left side of the board. In the adjacent diagram is an example of a castle built on the left side of the board paired with a Static Rook position.The position appeared in a professional game by Masataka G≈çda and Toshiaki Kubo on 2012 Feb 25. The castle is a Left Silver Crown Bear-in-the-hole (with advanced edge pawn). Further classification of Static Rook positions depends on response to the opponent's position of either Static Rook or Ranging Rook. Thus, there are the two types of Static Rook positions: Double Static Rook formations and Counter-Ranging Rook formations. Examples of Static Rook openings are below. * Double Static Rook types: ** Fortress (Áü¢ÂÄâ) ** Side Pawn Capture (Ê®™Ê≠©Âèñ„Çä) ** Bishop Exchange (ËßíÊèõ„Çè„Çä) ** Double Wing Attack (Áõ∏Êéõ„Åã„Çä) ** Snowroof (ÈõÅÊú®) * Counter-Ranging Rook Static Rook types: ** Left Silver-57 Rapid Attack (5‰∏ÉÈäÄÂ∑¶ÊÄ•Êà¶) ** Super High Speed Silver-37 (Ë∂ÖÈÄü3‰∏ÉÈäÄ) ** Iijima Bishop Pullback (È£ØÂ≥∂ÊµÅÂºï„ÅçËßí) * Static Rook types used for both Double Static Rook and Counter- Ranging Rook: ** Right Fourth File Rook (Âè≥ÂõõÈñìÈ£õËªä) ** Static Bishop Left Mino (Â±ÖËßíÂ∑¶ÁæéÊøÉ) ** Sleeve Rook (Ë¢ñÈ£õËªä) [Right Third File Rook] * Uncommon Static Rook types: ** First File Rook (‰∏ÄÈñìÈ£õËªä) ** Feint Static Rook (ÈôΩÂãïÂ±ÖÈ£õËªä) Ranging Rook Ranging Rook openings are positions in which the rook moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there. Most Ranging Rook openings coincide with a castle development on the player's right side of the board. In the adjacent diagram is an example of a castle built on the right side of the board paired with a Ranging Rook position (Fourth File Rook). The castle is a Mino castle. Examples of Ranging Rook openings: * Central Rook (‰∏≠È£õËªä) ** Cheerful Central Rook („Ç¥„Ç≠„Ç≤„É≥‰∏≠È£õËªä‰∏≠È£õËªä) * Fourth File Rook (ÂõõÈñìÈ£õËªä) ** Fujii System (Ëó§‰∫ï„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†) * Third File Rook (‰∏âÈñìÈ£õËªä) ** Quick Ishida (Êó©Áü≥Áî∞) ** 1... R-32 opening (2ÊâãÁõÆ‚òñ3‰∫åÈ£õ) ** Demon Slayer (È¨ºÊÆ∫„Åó) * Opposing Rook (Âêë„Åã„ÅÑÈ£õËªä) ** Tonari opening (ÈÉΩÊàêÊµÅ) * Double Ranging Rook (Áõ∏ÊåØ„ÇäÈ£õËªä) * Feint Ranging Rook (ÈôΩÂãïÊåØ„ÇäÈ£õËªä) =Attack initiation= The other traditional main categorization of shogi openings is based on the timing of a player's attack within the opening. A rapid attack (ÊÄ•Êà¶ ky≈´sen) variation of an opening has a player initiating an attack with only a weaker castle developed first or with very minimal castle development and sometimes with no castle development at all (leaving the king in its start position). The opposite type is a slow game (ÊåÅ‰πÖÊà¶ jiky≈´sen) in which both players spend much of the opening developing strong castles. For example, Fourth File Rook is an opening that has one player moving their rook to the fourth file if playing as White (or the sixth file if playing as Black) while the opponent plays Static Rook with their rook in its start position. Fourth File Rook has several rapid attack variations and slow game variations that are identified by the attack formations of the Static Rook player. In the rapid attack variations, the Static Rook player constructs a Boat castle ‚Äì a weaker castle ‚Äì and quickly builds an attack formation. In the slow game variations, the Static Rook player will build stronger castles such as Bear- in-the-hole castle or Left Mino castle. History of opening research The earliest openings in the historical record are Sleeve Rook, Wrong Diagonal Bishop, Right Fourth File Rook, and the Ranging Rook openings ‚Äì Central Rook, Fourth File Rook, Third File Rook, and Opposing Rook ‚Äì which are found around 1600. The earliest record of a shogi game (see adjacent diagram) is a single board position mentioned in the ÂÆ∂Âø†Êó•Ë®ò Ietada Nikki (diary) of the Matsudaira clan dated 1587 February. The players are not known. Black appears to be playing a Static Rook position while White a Central Rook position. The position appears unrefined from a modern perspective. The earliest full game record is a 1607 game between the First Lifetime Meijin (Black) and Hon'inb≈ç Sansa (White). Black is playing a Right Fourth File Rook (Static Rook) position while White is playing a Fourth File Rook position. As the ≈åhashi‚ÄìHon'inb≈ç games are Ranging Rook games, it is believed that these two significantly developed the opening theory. In 1615, the first handicap games ‚Äì Right Lance (now obsolete) ‚Äì are attested between ≈åhashi and Hon'inb≈ç. A little later around 1625, a form of the Double Wing Attack opening appears. Later still are Snowroof, Fortress, and Bishop Exchange. The 4th Lifetime Meijin, S≈çkei ≈åhashi III, who held the position 1691‚Äì1713, was responsible for making many advances in shogi opening research. However, after ≈åhashi, opening theory developed relatively slowly. At the start of the tumultuous Meiji Restoration in 1868, opening research largely stopped. In the 1910s, shogi tournaments started to be sponsored by newspapers, which lead to renewed study of openings and the creations of new josekis. In particular, Yoshio Kimura, Ch≈çtar≈ç Hanada (Ëä±Áî∞Èï∑Â§™ÈÉé), and Kingor≈ç Kaneko (Ëä±Áî∞Èï∑Â§™ÈÉé) lead many opening innovations in the 1920s and 1930s.Hodges (1977) =Opening popularity= Over time the popularity of various opening theory has changed. For instance, the earliest games in the historical record were Black's Static Rook vs White's Ranging Rook. However, after the 8th Lifetime Meijin was appointed in 1744, Double Static Rook openings became the standard way due to the superior winning results of Static Rook over Ranging Rook at the time, and Ranging Rook openings were mostly abandoned. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that Ranging Rook openings became more popular. The popularity of Ranging Rook gained more ground with high winning results 1950s‚Äì1970s from strong Ranging Rook player Yasuharu ≈åyama. The opening principle of fighting for control of the center with both players pushing central pawns ‚òñ...P-54 and ‚òóP-56 can be seen in older variations of Double Wing Attack opening. This way of playing was heavily researched and reached its pinnacle during 1790‚Äì1800 when the 9th Lifetime Meijin Soei ≈åhashi wrote a book on it. Nowadays, this is considered old fashioned as control of the center is no longer emphasized in modern shogi theory.Hodges (1977) (Cf. Chess strategy¬ßControl of the center.) Another example is the Bear-in-the-hole castle. It was used during the Edo period and later lost popularity to the Mino castle. However, it was rediscovered and began to used in the 20th century in Ranging Rook positions.Hodges (1977) And, later in the 1970s, the Bear-in-the-hole gained popularity in Static Rook positions as well, which continues into the 21st century. The Snowroof opening was invented in the Edo period as well. It was popular in the first part of the 20th century but lost popularity after the 1940s and 1950s and was found only sporadically in professional games. However, recently, in 2017, the Snowroof has surged in popularity with professional players as a good strategy to combat opponents using Fortress strategies.Â∞ÜÊ£ã‰∏ñÁïå [sh≈çgi sekai] (2017 November) Change in popularity of Static Rook openings in professional games over a 34-year period (NHK Shogi Focus: April 16, 2016) Change in popularity of Ranging Rook openings in professional games over a 34-year period (NHK Shogi Focus: April 16, 2016) Percent of openings (Ranging Rook and Static Rook) used in professional games in 2016 (NHK Shogi Focus: April 16, 2016) Other openings The list of openings presented above don't fit as well with the traditional classification. They include trap or surprise openings (Â•áË•≤Êà¶Ê≥ï kish≈´ senp≈ç) ‚Äì such as Demon Slayer ‚Äì and uncommon openings (such as the Ureshino opening). Others are somewhat harder to classify in the usual way by the position of the rook. For example, Twisting Rook is both a Static Rook and a Ranging Rook opening position while Right King exceptionally uses the rook as a defensive piece adjacent to the king flouting the general maxim that kings are castled away from rooks. =Right King= Right King (Âè≥Áéâ migi gyoku) is a defensive opening in which the king stays on the right side of board along with rook, which protects the last rank 9 as well as the eighth file. It is an exception to the general rule that the king is castled away from the rook. It is possible to use a Right King formation within a Bishop Exchange opening as well as other openings. =Twisting Rook= Twisting Rook („Å≤„Å≠„ÇäÈ£õËªä hineribisha) or Rook On Pawn (Á∏¶Ê≠©Âèñ„Çä tate fudori) is characterized by first playing a Static Rook opening that then switches to a Ranging Rook strategy with the rook positioned in front of one's camp. Since the starting Static Rook opening is Double Wing Attack, it is usually considered a variation of Double Wing Attack. =Wrong Diagonal Bishop= Wrong Diagonal Bishop (Á≠ãÈÅï„ÅÑËßí sujichigai kaku) is characterized by an early bishop exchange followed by dropping the bishop in hand on the 45 square if played by Black or the 65 square if played by White. The Wrong Diagonal Bishop player has the options of playing a Ranging Rook or a Static Rook position. =Bishop Head Pawn= Bishop Head Pawn or Bishop's Head Pawn Push (ËßíÈ†≠Ê≠© kakut≈çfu or ËßíÈ†≠Ê≠©Á™Å„Åç kakut≈ç fuzuki) is characterized by advancing the bishop's head pawn on 87 to 86 early in the game, in which it is undefended. =Pinwheel= Pinwheel (È¢®Ëªä kazeguruma) is an opening with the rook on the bottom rank 9 (or rank 1 if played by White) enabling it to switch between a Ranging Rook and Static Rook attack. The pinwheel name comes from the way the king is able to rotate around the gold positioned on the 58 square as if it were a wheel. =First File Rook= First File Rook (‰∏ÄÈñìÈ£õËªä ikkenbisha or ichigenbisha) is a surprise Static Rook opening in which the player's rook supports an attack on the player's rightmost edge file. =Buoyant Rook= Buoyant Rook (ÊµÆ„ÅçÊµÆ„ÅçÈ£õËªä ukiukibisha) is a surprise Static Rook opening in which the player's rook is advanced to the file directly above their line of pawns (rank 6 for Black or rank 4 for White). =Pac-Man= Pac-Man („Éë„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éû„É≥ pakkuman or ÂõõÊ≠©„Éë„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éû„É≥ yon fu pakkuman) is a trap opening. It is named after the video game Pac-Man. The opening has an early pawn gambit made by White on the fourth file which may be metaphorically eaten as if by Pac-Man. If Black takes the pawn with their bishop, then White will play a Fourth File Rook position. In this case, if Black plays without careful thought, then White's trap may succeed. =Demon Slayer= Demon Slayer (È¨ºÊÆ∫„Åó oni koroshi) is a trap opening sequence initiated by Black that characteristically advances their left knight blocking their bishop. Later moves attempt an attack using a further advanced knight and also possibly White's left silver. There is also a variant known as New Demon Slayer (Êñ∞È¨ºÊÆ∫„Åó shin oni koroshi). =Ureshino= The Ureshino (Â¨âÈáéÊµÅ ureshino-ry≈´) opening is a newer aggressive Static Rook opening characterized by moving the right silver to the sixth file and then pulling back the bishop to the silver's start position. It has an element of surprise as the move sequences are nonstandard and not found in professional play. =Lady Killer Wham-Bam Rook= The Lady Killer Wham-Bam Rook (Â•≥ÊÆ∫„Åó„Éâ„ÉÉ„Ç´„É≥È£õËªä onna koroshi dokkan hisha) is a Ranging Rook surprise opening that was used by pornographer Oniroku Dan. =Tonari= The Tonari opening (ÈÉΩÊàêÊµÅ tonari-ry≈´) is a new Ranging Rook surprise opening that was invented by professional Ryuuma Tonari. It was presented on the Âõ≤Á¢Å„ÉªÂ∞ÜÊ£ã„ÉÅ„É£„É≥„Éç„É´ (Go/Shogi Channel) by professional player Tetsur≈ç Itodani. Identification by initial moves Although it is more common for Japanese theory to categorize openings by their shape rather than move sequences, it is nonetheless also possible to identify specific openings based upon initial move sequences in a way reminiscent to the way western chess openings are classified. (Cf. Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.) Below are common four-move sequences associated with common openings as presented by K≈çji Tanigawa on the NHK television program Sh≈çgi K≈çza (NHKÂ∞ÜÊ£ãË¨õÂ∫ß) in April 2006 and organized by the position of Black. =Black's rook pawn push ‚òóP-26= By advancing their rook pawn (1. ‚òóP-26) in the first four moves, Black reveals very early their intention to play a Static Rook position. Although this move obviously gives White more information about Black's strategy, it also does limit both players' future moves in a way that opening the bishop diagonal (that is, 1. ‚òóP-76) on the first move does not. (For instance, the 1... R-32 opening and Quick Ishida are not possible for White if Black pushes their rook pawn first.) At the same time, not opening the bishop diagonal also adds some other possibilities which rely on a closed diagonal such as the Iijima Bishop Pullback opening or the Ureshino opening. However, a Feint Ranging Rook position is still possible where this rook pawn push is the feint that tries to convince White that they will be playing against a Static Rook position after which Black moves their rook leftward to form a Ranging Rook position instead. The advantage is that if White develops certain structures to attack or defend against a Static Rook opponent they may not be as effective against Ranging Rook opponents. Although Feint Ranging Rook has occurred in professional games, it is uncommon. An initial rook pawn push could either be pushed further (2. ‚òóP-25) or combined with activating their bishop by opening its diagonal (2. ‚òóP-76). ‚òóP-26, ‚òóP-25 1\\\\. P-26 P-84 2. P-25 P-85. Looking at Black's position with two pushes of the rook pawn, the most common way this is used is when Black first pushes their rook pawn (1. P-26) which is answered by White doing the same (1...P-84) leading to a Double Static Rook game. From here, a natural way to play is for Black to push their pawn once more (2. P-25). Then, since White is under the threat of an attack on the second file, White is most likely to push their rook pawn again as well to give Black the same counterattacking threat (2...P-85). This 4-move position usually leads to a Double Wing Attack opening with the subsequent moves: 3. G-78 G-32 4. P-24 Px24 5. Rx24 P*23 to be followed by either 6. R-26 or 6. R-28. Note that although this is the most common sequence leading to Double Wing, it is not the only way Double Wing openings can come about. ‚òóP-26, ‚òóP-76 Another set of openings with Black's rook pawn push also include opening the bishop diagonal in addition (‚òóP-26, ‚òóP-76). Although Black will be playing a Static Rook position, White has the freedom of responding to Black with either a Ranging Rook position or a Static Rook position. =1. ‚òóP-26 ‚òñP-84 2. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-85= After Black's chooses Static Rook with 1. P-26, White can also push their rook pawn (1...P-84) for a Static Rook position leading to a Double Static Rook game. Then, Black also opens their bishop diagonal activating their bishop (2. P-76). This sequence could be transposed to a 1. P-76 P-84 2. P-26 sequence. After this, White may push their rook pawn once more (2...P-85) threatening a pawn exchange on the eighth file. This 4-move sequence usually leads to a Bishop Exchange opening. One variation has the following moves: 3. B-77 P-34 4. S-88 preparing for 4...Bx77+. Another variation could include a rook pawn push by Black first: 3. P-25 G-32 4. B-77 P-34 5. S-88 again preparing for 5...Bx77+. =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-34 2. ‚òóP-26 ‚òñP-84= Besides pushing only their rook pawn, White can open their bishop diagonal during their first 2 moves as well leading to a greater range of opening possibilities. Black's open bishop diagonal (1. P-76) is met with White's open bishop diagonal (1...P-34). Then, Black plays the most common move of choosing Static Rook (2. P-26). These three moves could also be transposed to 1. P-26 P-34 2. P-76. After this, White does the same rook pawn push (2...P-84) leading to a symmetrical Double Static Rook board. Another possible (but less common) transposition of the four moves could be 1. P-26 P-84 2. P-76 P-34. This 4-move sequence will usually be followed by 3. P-25 P-85 4. G-78 G-32 5. P-24 Px24 6. Rx24, which is a sequence that often leads to the Side Pawn Capture opening (after 6...P-86 7.Px86 Rx86 8. Rx34). This opening is fairly sharp since both of the major pieces (rook and bishop) are being activated from the start before any castle construction is attempted. Although Side Pawn Capture is most common, a Double Wing Attack opening with mutually open bishop diagonals is another possibility. =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-34 2. ‚òóP-26 ‚òñP-44= In this sequence (or transposition 1. P-26 P-34 2. P-26), after mutual open bishop diagonals and Black's Static Rook move, White opts to close their bishop diagonal (2...P-44). This move reduces the complexity of the opening by preventing both players from trading their bishop off the board. After the diagonal is closed with this 4-move sequence, Black usually develops their right silver toward the center with 3. S-48. White's most likely set of responses is to play a Ranging Rook position by moving their rook leftward, such as with ...R-42 for Fourth File Rook, ...R-32 for Third File Rook or ...R-52 for Central Rook. And, whenever Black pushes their rook pawn again with P-25, the pawn trade on the second file will be prevented by White's bishop with ...B-33. If Black pushes the pawn early, then White may opt for yet another Ranging Rook position, Opposing Rook, by moving the rook to the second file with ...R-22 as the bishop will no longer be blocking the rook's movement to this square. Examples include the following: * Static Rook vs Fourth File Rook: 3. S-48 R-42 5. K-68 * Static Rook vs Fourth File Rook: 3. S-48 S-32 4. P-56 R-42 * Static Rook vs Third File Rook: 3. S-48 R-32 4. P-25 B-33 * Static Rook vs Central File Rook: 3. S-48 S-42 4. P-56 P-54 5. G49-58 R-52 * Static Rook vs Opposing File Rook: 3. P-25 B-33 4. S-48 R-22 However, White's position is also flexible enough to play a Static Rook formation such as Fortress by moving the silver up to ...S-42 so that a Fortress castle can be formed and preventing Black from trading off the second file pawn by moving the silver to the 33 square. For example: * Static Rook vs Fortress: 3. S-48 S-42 4. P-25 S-33. Yet another Static Rook possibility for White is for the silver on 42 to move up to 43 for a Snowroof opening where pawn exchange on the second file may be prevented by White moving their bishop to the 33 square (although White is not required to prevent the pawn exchange by leaving their bishop in its start position on 22). =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-34 2. ‚òóP-26 ‚òñP-54= After open bishop diagonals for both players, another possible response to Black's pawn push (2. P-26) is for White to push their central pawn (2...P-54). After this 4-move sequence, White aims to support this central pawn by swinging their rook to the central file. With both players' bishops fully activated, this particular Central Rook variation is Cheerful Central Rook. The opening continues with 3. P-25 R-52. After this, Black may develop a general (with 4. S-48 or 4. G49-58) or the king (with 4. K-68), and White will push their central pawn once again with 4...P-55 in order to convert it to a vanguard pawn. Of course, since the bishops are activated, a bishop trade variation with 4. Bx22+ Sx22 instead is also possible, which is known as the Maruyama Vaccine (‰∏∏Â±±„ÉØ„ÇØ„ÉÅ„É≥ maruyama wakuchin). =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-34 2. ‚òóP-26 ‚òñG-32= Another fourth move response to the same 3-move 1. P-76 P-34 2. P-26 sequence is for White to protect the second file with a gold (2...G-32). After this 4-move sequence, the opening is likely to be Tempo Loss Bishop Exchange with 3. P-25 Bx88+ 4. Sx88 S-22. The Tempo Loss Bishop Exchange opening has many similarities with the regular Bishop Exchange opening (shown above) ‚Äì the important differences being a loss of one tempo for White and White's 85 square being unoccupied for a possible right knight jump later in the game (since White's rook pawn was not pushed early like in the regular Bishop Exchange). =Black's bishop pawn ‚òóP-76 (no ‚òóP-26)= There are several possible openings if Black does not push their rook pawn forward in the first four moves and instead focuses on activating their bishop (P-76) and developing other pieces. These include Ranging Rook openings as well as Static Rook openings where the rook pawn is delayed. Likewise, White can respond to Black's moves with either Static Rook or Ranging Rook positions. Thus, the world of possibilities include Double Static Rook, Static Rook vs Ranging Rook, Ranging Rook vs Static Rook, and Double Ranging Rook games. ‚òóP-76, ‚òóS-68 =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-84 2. ‚òóS-68 ‚òñP-34= After Black opens their bishop diagonal (1. P-76), White plays Static Rook (1...P-84). Then, in order to defend the eighth file so that White cannot trade off their rook pawn, White develops their silver (2. S-68) so that it may reach the 77 square should White push their rook pawn again to the 85 square (which otherwise would aim for P-86 Px86 Rx86). Since Black's bishop is now undefended, White activates their bishop (2...P-34). For this reason, this 4-move sequence cannot transpose to 1. P-76 P-34 2. S-68 P-84 (or 1. S-68 P-34 2. P-76) because after 1. P-76 P-34 2. S-68 Black's bishop would be captured for free. This leads to the very common Fortress opening, which is often (but not always) a Double Fortress opening. There are two common developments following this: * 3. P-66 S-62 4. P-56 * 3. S-77 S-62 4. P-26 The 3. S-77 variation is very clearly Fortress since the Fortress castle is formed with the characteristic silver on the 77 square. The 3. P-66 variation, although a very common sequence for Fortress, is also flexible enough to transition to a Ranging Rook opening like Fourth File Rook (for example, 3. P-66 S-62 4. S-67 P-54 5. R-68) or the less common Static Rook opening, Snowroof. ‚òóP-76, ‚òóR-68/78 Black's open bishop diagonal can be combined with an early Ranging Rook movement to play Third File Rook or Fourth File Rook. (Central Rook is also possible but less common.) =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-84 2. ‚òóR-78 ‚òñP-34= After Black's open bishop diagonal (1. P-76) and White's Static Rook (1...P-84), Black swings their rook over to the seventh file (2. R-78) to play Black's variation of Third File Rook. Then, White opens their bishop diagonal as well (2...P-34) threatening to exchange the bishops off the board. After this 4-move sequence, the opening is Black's Normal Third File vs Static Rook continuing with 3. P-66 P-84 4. B-77. Note that this sequence usually does not transpose to 1. P-76 P-34 2. R-78 P-84. If Black moves their rook with mutually open bishop diagonals (1. P-76 P-34 2. R-78), it leads to a sharp variation starting with a bishop trade with 2...Bx88+ 3. Sx88 B*45. =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-34 2. ‚òóR-68 ‚òñP-84= This may transpose to 1. P-76 P-84 2. R-68 P-34. Transpositions of 1. R-68 P-84 2. P-76 P-34 and 1. R-68 P-34 2. P-76 P-84 are also possible but very uncommon since other minor variations may follow 1. R-68 P-34. ‚òóP-76, ‚òóP-56 =1. ‚òóP-76 ‚òñP-84 2. ‚òóP-56 ‚òñP-85= ‚òóP-76, ‚òóP-66 ‚òóP-76, ‚òóP-75 ‚òóP-76, ‚òóP-16 =‚òó1. P-76 ‚òñP-34 2. ‚òóP-16 ‚òñP-84= After opening both bishop diagonals (1. P-76 P-34), White has not revealed to Black what their strategy will be. If Black wishes to play a Ranging Rook opening (like Fourth File Rook), Black may only choose a particular Ranging Rook opening if White chooses a Static Rook opening while they may want to choose a different set of openings if White chooses a Ranging Rook opening. Therefore, pushing an edge pawn (2. P-16) in the first two moves is a noncommittal move by Black aiming to wait and see what their opponent's opening will be. This edge pawn push also fits well the common Mino castle construction on the right side regardless of whether playing against a Ranging Rook or Static Rook opponent. If White pushes their rook pawn indicating Static Rook (2...P-84), then Black can choose a Fourth File position. This is often seen in the Fujii System strategies, which can develop with 3. P-66 S-62 4. R-68 K-42 5. S-38. Of course, White can sidestep the issue by playing a noncommittal edge pawn as well with 2...P-14. =Frequency of initial move sequences= Out of the 64,046 recorded (mostly) professional games on Kyokumenpedia (Â±ÄÈù¢„Éö„ÉÇ„Ç£„Ç¢) as of 2018 Mar 17, 77.2% started with a bishop pawn opening (P-76) and 20.8% started with a rook pawn opening (P-26).

Fire drills  A fire drill is a method of practising how a building would be evacuated in the event of a fire or other emergency. Usually, the building's existing fire alarm system is activated and the building is evacuated as if the emergency had occurred. Generally, the time it takes to evacuate is measured to ensure that it occurs within a reasonable length of time, and problems with the emergency system or evacuation procedures are identified to be remedied.  Tornado drills  Students participate in a tornado drill, lining up along an interior wall and covering their heads. Tornado drills are an important element in tornado preparedness. Like any other safety drills, they increase chances of correct response to a real tornado threat. Most states in the midwestern and southern United States conduct a statewide tornado drill in late winter or early spring in preparation for the severe weather season. During these drills, the National Weather Service issues test tornado warnings, and local Emergency Alert Systems and/or NOAA Weather Radio (normally as a Required Weekly Test or Required Monthly Test; Live Tornado Warning Codes can only be used if a waiver from the FCC is granted since \\"Live Code Testing\\" is prohibited per regulations) are activated along with outdoor warning sirens. Schools and businesses may also conduct a tornado drill simultaneously. A tornado drill is a procedure of practicing to take cover in a specified location in the event that a tornado strikes an area. This safety drill is an important element of tornado preparedness.\\"Disaster Prep 101\\", , pp154-155 Generally, a signal is given, such as a series of tones (ex. Continuous Tone), or a voice announcement. Upon receiving the signal, building occupants of schools, hospitals, factories, shopping centers, etc. proceed to a designated location, usually an interior room or corridor with no windows, and assume a protective position.Florida Disaster In homes and small buildings one must go to the basement or an interior room on the lowest floor (if there), (closet, bathroom), to stay away from glass. Cars and mobile homes must be abandoned, if there is small chance to drive away. In some jurisdictions, schools are required to conduct regular tornado drills, though generally less frequently than fire drills. =Tornado drills by state= In many states tornado drills are part of the Severe Weather Awareness Week. *Alabama *Florida *Indiana *Iowa *Ohio *Minnesota Minnesota: Tornado Drill Day *Missouri *South Dakota *Texas *VirginiaVirginia: Tornado drill *Wisconsin *North Carolina  Lockdown drills  Lockdown drills are means of practicing preparedness in a business in the event of an intruder or criminal act. Generally an announcement is given that the building is going on an immediate lockdown. At that point, all occupants present at the time of the drill go to a room and lock all doors and windows tight. They must remain still until an \\"all-clear signal\\" has been issued. If the emergency is really life-threatening, then occupants present at the time of the emergency will evacuate to a meeting zone well away from the premises (scene of the emergency).  Earthquake drill  An earthquake drill is a drill used to practice in preparation for an earthquake. Schools in some areas conduct earthquake drills. Stop, drop and hold on is used during the drill. School Safety Preparedness Drill (SSPD) is an annual earthquake preparedness drill being organised in schools of North and North Eastern states of India commemorating 4 April 1905 Kangra earthquake. The two Non- Governmental Organisations GeoHazards Society (GHS) and GeoHazards International (GHI) has been working for earthquake safety in South Asia for many years. In the year 2009 both the organisations along with Library of Tibetan Works and Archives together decided to mark the most destructive Kangra earthquake at Dharamshala in India. Considering the vulnerability of the school children in one of the most earthquake prone region of the world a School Safety Preparedness Drill was organised in the Tibetan schools along the Himalayas in India at 11:00 morning. About 7,500 children participated in the first ever such kind of a drill in India on 4 April 2009 in 25 Tibetan schools. During the SSPD the schools prepare for an earthquake scenario and when the shaking starts the children along with staff perform a Drop Cover Hold on under sturdy tables and desks preparing to save themselves from falling objects. When the shaking stops everybody evacuates to a pre- designated assembly area followed by a debriefing. With every passing year the drill started expanding to new areas covering more children both at Tibetan and non-Tibetan schools. In the 5th SSPD in 2013 more than 50,000 children participated in 162 schools in North and North East Indian states. Moreover, one school from Bhutan and another from Mandalay in Myanmar also participated in that drill. with participation of more than 725,000 children in 1100 schools.

It is an important area for nesting and migrating waterfowl and other birds. The reserve is divided into five distinct sectors on the southern and eastern shores of the lake. The reserve is situated in the Spassky District, in the southwest of Primorsky Krai. It was formally established in 1990, and covers an area of . It is part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Topography The southern two-thirds of Khanka is in Russia; the northern third is in China. The total surface area of the lake is 4,190 km2. The Khanka Reserve is split into five sections that cover parts of the southern shore, the eastern shore, and a spur that extends from the northeast of the lake. The terrain around the lake is mostly flat and lacustrine-alluvial, with rolling hills off the lake; the highest point is 147 meters. The five sections are: * River - (12,494 ha) * Crane - (9,479 ha) * Devil's swamp - (16,641 ha) * Pine - (375 ha) * Melgunovsky - (300 ha) Around the lake are bogs underlain by a thick layer of clay. Because water cannot sink through the clay, the plains around the lake are frequently waterlogged. There are 9 rivers than feed into the lake, but only one, the Songacha River, that flows out. The Songacha is a tributary of the Ussuri River, and ultimately the Amur River to the north. Climate and Ecoregion Khanka is located in the Suiphun-Khanka meadows and forest meadows ecoregion, a forest-less area around Lake Khanka in the Russian Far East, on the Upper Ussuri River, and along the Suiphun River to the south. This ecoregion is characterized by fire tolerant meadows and Mongolian oak woodland, with high levels of species diversity and endemism. The climate of Khanka is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The maximum monthly mean temperature is in July, while the minimum monthly mean temperature is in January. Rainfall mainly occurs in summer, with average annual precipitation of 500‚Äì650 mm annually. Flora and fauna The reserve covers many different floral habitats - meadow, swamp, steppe, lacustrine, and forest. About 30% of the meadows are reed grass. The steppe- type areas are grasslands at the feet of the ridges, with characteristic species being bent grass, wild onion, and horsetail. Average height of vegetation in these areas is 20‚Äì40 cm. Inland of the eastern shore of the lake are widespread peat bogs. The marshes, usually dominated locally by one type of reed grasses, are valued by the waterfowl for food and shelter. Aquatic vegetation is diverse. In the shallow bays are thickets of pondweed, with floating patches of lilies and other surface cover. Shallow areas feature arrowhead, knotweed, and bloodroot, while all shores feature reeds, grasses, and wild rice. There is one forest on the site, of Mongolian oak and associated plants. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 685 species of vascular plants. The animal life of the reserve is most notable for birds: 337 species have been recorded, and 140 species are known to breed on the site. Characteristic mammals are raccoon dog and fox, and nine species of mice. The fish of the lake include catfish, pike, and various species of carp. Ecoeducation and access As a strict nature reserve, the Khanka Reserve itself is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are, however, buffer zones along the lakes that are open from low-impact tourism and leisure use. Also, there are 'ecotourist' routes with bird observation towers for seasonal use by the public, but use requires permits to be obtained in advance and group size and numbers are limited. The main office is in the city of Spassk-Dalny.

Allegations of state support =Syria= During the ongoing Syrian Civil War, President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian government have been accused by many opposition and other anti-Assad parties of collusion with ISIL. Many Islamist prisoners were released from Syrian prisons at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, which many sources have suggested indicated a strategic attempt to strengthen jihadist factions over other rebels, which eventually contributed to forging ISIL. The Syrian government has reportedly bought oil directly from ISIL, and the Syrian government and ISIL jointly ran a HESCO gas plant in Tabqah. The facility supplied electricity to government-held areas, while government-run power plants supplied ISIL-held areas. A report on 25 June 2015 said that ISIL kept gas flowing to Assad regime-controlled power stations. Furthermore, ISIL allowed grain to pass from Rojava to government-controlled areas at the cost of a 25% levy. In 2017, US and European officials said that oil sales to the Syrian government were ISIL's largest source of revenue. Several sources have said that the Syrian government has tactically avoided ISIL forces in order to weaken opposition such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA). According to United States Secretary of State John Kerry the Syrian government purposely ceded territory to ISIL. An IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center database analysis showed that only 6% of Syrian government forces attacks were targeted at ISIL from January to November 2014, while in the same period only 13% of all ISIL attacks targeted government forces. The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has stated that the Syrian government has operatives inside ISIL, as has the leadership of Ahrar ash-Sham. On 1 June 2015, the United States embassy in Syria stated that the Syrian government was \\"making air-strikes in support\\" of an ISIL advance on Syrian opposition positions north of Aleppo. The president of the Syrian National Coalition, Khaled Koja, accused Assad of acting \\"as an air force for [ISIL]\\", with the Defence Minister of the SNC Salim Idris stating that approximately 180 Syrian government officers were serving in ISIL and coordinating the group's attacks with the Syrian Army. According to Sharmine Narwani in The American Conservative, an April 2017 report by UK information provider IHS Markit stated that the Islamic State fought Syrian government forces more than any other opponent between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017. According to the report, \\"43 percent of all Islamic State fighting in Syria was directed against President Assad's forces, 17 against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the remaining 40 percent involved fighting rival Sunni opposition groups\\". =Turkey= The Turkish government has been criticised for allowing ISIL to use Turkish territory for logistics and channelling recruits. It has also been accused of selling arms and intelligence to ISIL, as part of its campaign against the People's Protection Units (YPG). Turkey denies the allegations of assisting ISIL, pointing to multiple terrorist attacks ISIL has committed against civilians in Turkey, as well as multiple military confrontations between ISIL and the Turkish government. The Kurdistan Democratic Party in Iraq similarly deny the claim that Turkey is providing aid to ISIL. According to an intelligence adviser quoted by Seymour Hersh, a \\"highly classified assessment\\" carried out by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2013 concluded that Turkey had effectively transformed the secret U.S. arms program in support of moderate rebels, who no longer existed, into an indiscriminate program to provide technical and logistical support for al-Nusra Front and ISIL. =Saudi Arabia= In June 2014, former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki accused the government of Saudi Arabia of funding ISIL. The Saudi Arabian government rejected the claims. Some media outlets, such as NBC, the BBC, The New York Times, and the US-based think tank Washington Institute for Near East Policy have written about individual Saudi donations to the group and the Saudi state's decade-long sponsorship of Salafism and Wahhabism around the world, but concluded in 2014 that there was no evidence of direct Saudi state support for ISIL. In July 2014, Richard Dearlove, former head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), said that the Saudis were \\"deeply attracted to any militancy that can effectively challenge Shia-dom [Shia version of Islam].\\"\\"Iraq crisis: How Saudi Arabia helped Isis take over the north of the country,\\" Independent, 13 July 2014. Dearlove stated that, \\"For ISIS to be able to surge into the Sunni areas of Iraq in the way that it has done recently has to be the consequence of substantial and sustained funding.\\" In an August 2014 email leaked by WikiLeaks, apparently from former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to then counselor John Podesta, a memo states that the governments of both Saudi Arabia and Qatar \\"are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.\\" =Qatar= Qatar has long been accused of acting as a conduit for the flow of funds to ISIL. While there is no proof that the Qatari government is involved in this movement of funds, it has been criticised for not doing enough to stem monies sent by private donors in the country. According to some reports, US officials believe that the largest portion of private donations supporting ISIS and al Qaeda-linked groups now comes from Qatar rather than Saudi Arabia. In August 2014, German minister Gerd M√ºller accused Qatar of having links to ISIL, stating: \\"You have to ask who is arming, who is financing ISIS troops. The keyword there is Qatar.\\" Qatari Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah rejected this statement, saying: \\"Qatar does not support extremist groups, including [ISIL], in any way. We are repelled by their views, their violent methods and their ambitions.\\" =United States= Rand Paul, junior U.S. Senator from Kentucky, has accused the U.S. government of indirectly supporting ISIL in the Syrian Civil War, by arming their allies and fighting their enemies in that country. The US assisted the Syrian opposition from 2013 to 2017 (see CIA-led Timber Sycamore program) and according to some authors some of the US proxies worked with ISIL.Now the truth emerges: how the US fuelled the rise of Isis in Syria and Iraq =Pakistan= Former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai accused Pakistan for supporting ISIS during interview with ANI that Afghanistan has evidence of Pakistan's support to ISIS.He added that there is no to the above statement. United States accused Pakistan for supporting ISIS in Syria. Foreign nationals A United Nations report showed that 25,000 \\"foreign terrorist fighters\\" from 100 countries had joined \\"Islamist\\" groups, many of them working for ISIL or al-Qaeda. The US-trained commander of Tajikistan's Interior Ministry OMON police special forces, Gulmurod Khalimov, has been raised to the rank of \\"Minister of War\\" within the Islamic State. One of the most prominent commanders of ISIL in Syria, Abu Omar al-Shishani, served previously as a sergeant in the Georgian Army before being medically discharged, later imprisoned, becoming radicalized, then fleeing the country. A 2015 report by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University found 71 individuals charged in the United States with supporting ISIL, 250 travelling or attempting to travel to Syria or Iraq from the United States to join ISIL, and about 900 active domestic ISIL-related investigations. An October 2016 World Bank study found that \\"ISIL's foreign fighters are surprisingly well-educated.\\" Using the fighters' self-reported educational levels, the study concluded that \\"69% of recruits reported at least a secondary-level education\\" of which \\"a large fraction have gone on to study at university\\" and also that \\"only 15% of recruits left school before high school; less than 2% are illiterate.\\" The study also found that foreign fighters are often more educated than their countrymen where those \\"from Europe and in Central Asia have similar levels of education to their countrymen\\" while those \\"from the Middle East, North Africa, and South and East Asia are significantly more educated than what is typical in their home nations.\\" The report notes that its conclusions that terrorism is not driven by poverty and low levels of education which conforms with previous research. However, the report did find a strong correlation \\"between a country's male unemployment rate and the propensity of the country to supply foreign fighters\\". Many European countries have allowed their citizens that joined ISIL to be prosecuted by Iraq. =Foreign nationals by country= Australia In August 2018, Australia stripped the Australian citizenship from five terrorists who had travelled to fight with the Islamic State and barred them from entering Australia again. This was only possible because they had double citizenships because international law stops the measure from being used on individuals with only one citizenship. The five brought the total to six. Belgium Up to 2018, an estimated 450 individuals had travelled from Belgium to join the civil war in Syria and Iraq. Of those, 75 were linked to the Sharia4Belgium network. In July 2018, courts announced that Belgium had no obligation to bring children of Islamic State members to Belgium. Denmark In November 2017 stripped a Turkish man of his Danish citizenship after having been sentenced for terror offenses related to the Islamic State, which left him with a citizenship of Turkey. France Up to 2018, an estimated 1700 individuals had travelled from France to join the civil war in Syria and Iraq. Germany Up to 2018, an estimated 940 individuals had travelled from Germany to join the civil war in Syria and Iraq. Netherlands The Parliament of Netherlands voted in 2016 for legislation to strip Dutch citizens who join ISIL or al Qaeda abroad of their citizenship, also if they have not been convicted of any crime. The law can only be applied to individuals with double citizenship. Justice Minister Ard Van der Steur stated the legal changes were necessary to stop jihadists from returning to the Netherlands. In September 2017, four jihadists were stripped of their citizenship. In the 2012 to November 2018 period, more than 310 individuals had travelled from the Netherlands to the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Of those 85 had been killed and 55 returned to the Netherlands. Of the surviving Dutch foreign fighters in the region, 135 are fighters in the conflict zone and three quarters are members of ISIL. The remaining quarter have joined Al-Qaeda affiliated groups such as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham or Tanzim Hurras al-Deen. Sweden Up to 2018, an estimated 300 individuals had travelled from Sweden to join the civil war in Syria. In March 2018 Kurdish authorities reported they had captured 41 IS supporters with either Swedish citizenship or residence permit in Sweden, of which 5 had key positions in the organisation and one was the head of the ISIL propaganda efforts. United Kingdom Cabinet minister William Hague stated in 2014 that up to 400 UK citizens had joined ISIL. The government instituted a practice where if those who had joined had double citizenships were stripped of their UK citizenship to prevent them from arriving back in the UK. By 2017, 150 individuals had been stripped of citizenship and were thus unable to enter the United Kingdom again. Groups expressing support for ISIL The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) has identified 60 jihadist groups in 30 countries that have pledged allegiance to or support for ISIL as of mid- November 2014. That many of these groups were previously affiliated with al- Qaeda suggests a shift in global jihadist leadership towards ISIL. Members of the following groups have declared support for ISIL, either fully or in part: * Boko Haram * Ansar al-Sharia (Tunisia) * Jund al-Khilafah * Mujahideen Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem * Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid ‚Äì (pledged support to ISIL; the majority of the group split off after its leader pledged allegiance to ISIL) * Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan * Jundallah (Pakistan) * Caucasus Emirate (multiple Caucasus Emirate commanders switched allegiance to ISIL) * Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade * Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao ** Jemaah Islamiyah ** Abu Sayyaf ** Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters ** Ansar Khalifa Philippines In Islamic State territory =Syria= In response to the effort to take Raqqa by the Syrian Democratic Forces, whose main component is the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), some Syrian Arabs in Raqqa sided with the Islamic State. =Iraq= Sunni Arabs in Iraq have been accused of collaborating with ISIL against Assyrians, and Yazidis, and Shias. ISIL marked Christian homes with the letter n≈´n for Na·π£ƒÅrƒÅ and Shia homes with the letter rƒÅ æ for RƒÅfi·∏ça, derogatory terms used to describe Christians and Shias by some Sunni Muslims. Properties were confiscated and given to local ISIL supporters or foreign fighters. Local Sunnis were reported to have betrayed Yazidis once ISIL arrived, or colluded in advance to lure them into staying put until the ISIL invaded. 57 members of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party ‚Äì Iraq Region participated in the massacre of at least 1,566 Shia cadets from the Iraqi Air Force on 12 June 2014.

A third miscellany, in the collection of University College London was identified as being in his hand in 2012, and dates to circa 1603.
