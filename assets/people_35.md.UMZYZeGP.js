It is particularly common in commercial real estate appraisal and in business appraisal. The fundamental math is similar to the methods used for financial valuation, securities analysis, or bond pricing. However, there are some significant and important modifications when used in real estate or business valuation. While there are quite a few acceptable methods under the rubric of the income approach, most of these methods fall into three categories: direct capitalization, discounted cash flow, and gross income multiplier. Direct Capitalization This is simply the quotient of dividing the annual net operating income (NOI) by the appropriate capitalization rate (CAP rate). For income-producing real estate, the NOI is the net income of the real estate (but not the business interest) plus any interest expense and non-cash items (e.g. -- depreciation) minus a reserve for replacement. The CAP rate may be determined in one of several ways, including market extraction, band-of-investments, or a built-up method. When appraising complex property, or property which has a risk-adjustment due to unusual factors (e.g. -- contamination), a risk-adjusted cap rate is appropriate.Dr. Bill Mundy, The Impact of Hazardous Material on Value, The Appraisal Journal, 1992. An implicit assumption in direct capitalization is that the cash flow is a perpetuity and the cap rate is a constant. If either cash flows or risk levels are expected to change, then direct capitalization fails and a discounted cash flow method must be used. In UK practice, Net Income is capitalised by use of market-derived yields. If the property is rack-rented then the All Risks Yield will be used. However, if the passing rent differs from the Estimated Rental Value (ERV), then either the Term & Reversion, Layer or Equivalent Yield methods will be employed. In essence, these entail discounting the different income streams - that of the current or passing rent and that of the reversion to the full rental value - at different adjusted yields. However, capitalization rate inherently includes the investment-specific risk premium. Each investor may have a different view of risk and, therefore, arrive at a different capitalization rate for a given investment. The relationship becomes clear when the capitalization rate is derived from the discount rate using the build-up cost of capital model. The two are identical whenever the earnings growth rate equals 0.Equivalence of direct capitalization and discounting valuation methods. Discounted Cash Flow The Discounted cash flow model is analogous to net present value estimation in finance. However, appraisers often mistakenly use a market- derived cap rate and NOI as substitutes for the discount rate and/or the annual cash flow. The Cap rate equals the discount rate plus-or-minus a factor for anticipated growth. The NOI may be used if market value is the goal, but if investment value is the goal, then some other measure of cash flow is appropriate.Dr. John A. Kilpatrick, Market Value(s), presentation to the Appraisal Institute, 2000, http://www.greenfieldadvisors.com/publications/marketvalues.pdf , Gross Rent Multiplier The GRM is simply the ratio of the monthly (or annual) rent divided into the selling price. If several similar properties have sold in the market recently, then the GRM can be computed for those and applied to the anticipated monthly rent for the subject property. GRM is useful for rental houses, duplexes, and simple commercial properties when used as a supplement to other more well developed methods. Short-cut DCF The Short-cut DCF method is based on a model developed by Professor Neil Crosby of the University of Reading (and ultimately based on earlier work by Wood and Greaves). The RICS have encouraged use of the method in appropriate circumstances.See RICS (1997) Commercial Investment Property: Valuation Methods - An Information Paper. The Short-cut DCF is an adaptation to property valuation of the DCF method, which is widely used in finance. In the Short-cut DCF, the passing rent, which is constant (in nominal or real terms) for the duration of the rent period, is discounted at an appropriate rate of return (possibly derived by reference to the risk-free rate of return obtained on government bonds, to which is added an allowance for risk and an allowance for the illiquidity of property assets). The reversion is discounted at the market-derived All Risks Yield (ARY), which correctly implies growth in the reversionary income stream. The reversionary income is the current Estimated Rental Value (ERV) inflated by an appropriate annual growth factor (or CAGR - Compound Annual Growth Rate). The crux of the Crosby-Wood model, and that which sets it apart from the customary DCF, is that the growth factor is derived by means of formula, as a function of the rate of return and the All Risks Yield. For example, if the rate of return is 10% per annum, the ARY is 8% per annum and rent is reviewed annually, then the growth factor will be 2%. (This simple subtraction only works when rent is reviewed annually - in all other situations the growth factor is derived by use of the Crosby formula.) Thus the Short-cut DCF produces a mathematically consistent valuation and country See also *German income approach Further reading *Baum, A. and Mackmin, D.

It was mounted on Luftwaffe aircraft such as the Junkers Ju 87 G-1 and G-2; Henschel Hs 129B-2/R3; Messerschmitt Bf 110G-2/R1-3; Junkers Ju 88P-2 or P-3 and others. The cannon could be attached under the wings or the fuselage of the aircraft as self-contained gun pods with 12-round magazines. It fired Armour Piercing Composite Rigid (APCR, Tungsten-cored) ammunition or high-explosive shells at 160 rounds per minute. Service history BK 3,7 equipped ground attack aircraft were developed for tank hunting on the Eastern Front in an effort to blunt the massive numerical superiority of the Soviet T-34 tank as the war turned against Germany. The concept was rather rudimentary, suffered from poor accuracy, severe weight penalty making the craft vulnerable to fighters, and low ammunition capacity; but could be extremely effective when operated by a sufficiently skilled and practised ground-attack pilot, such as Hans-Ulrich Rudel in his BK 3,7 armed Junkers Ju 87G. The heavy-calibre autocannon-armed series of Junkers Ju 88P twin-engined attack‚Äìbomber destroyer aircraft series used twin BK 3,7 cannon, mounted side- by-side in a conformal ventral fuselage gun pod, in its Ju 88P-2 and P-3 versions. The P-3 version only differed through the addition of extra defensive armour. As with other examples of the P-series, the Ju 88P-2 and P-3 were perceived as failures as anti-tank and bomber destroyer aircraft. In contrast to the bombs delivered by dive bombing, when the BK 3,7 was used to attack the relatively thin armour of the top of the turret and the engine compartment armour of a tank, kills could be achieved with a relatively light and cheap armour-piercing projectile that could be carried in much greater quantities than bombs. One of the two surviving Junkers Ju 87s is a G-2 model displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford; the wings have attachment points for BK 3,7 gun pods but it is not displayed with them fitted.

Neither the time period nor the precise location are specified in the film, in part because the story is told as much from a wolf's point of view as from a human's. There is no dialogue in the film; the only interpretation is through a story-song composed and sung by the Sons of the Pioneers and the Sherman Brothers, and narration by Rex Allen. Filming took place in Sedona, Arizona. Lobo is based upon Lobo the King of Currumpaw, an 1890s wolf described in a non-fictional account by naturalist Ernest Seton, who was the bounty hunter in the real-life story.  Plot  The film begins when Lobo is a 6-week old pup, identical to his brothers and sisters. While his father, El Feroz is out hunting for meat to feed the family, Lobo follows his nose to his first adventure, and takes a tumble down the cliff where the family den is. As soon as he manages to climb back up, a cougar appears on the scene. Things look grim for the wolves, until \\"a wild card\\" shows up; cattlemen riding by below the wolves' den spot the cougar, and shoot it as it prepares to pounce on the wolves. The narrator makes it clear that the cattlemen do not favor the wolves: Lobo is only spared because he's out of sight. When Lobo's father returns to the den soon after the incident, he smells both the cougar and the cattlemen, and decides to pick up and move house to avoid them. As Lobo travels with his family in search of a new den, they interact with a variety of creatures. His father fights with a badger over possession of a den, and the badger wins after an excellent show. At some point Lobo wanders off as his family moves on; he makes friends with a tortoise, chews an armadillo's ear, and is cornered by a rattlesnake when his parents finally arrive to rescue him. As Lobo begins to grow up, he also forms an unusual friendship with a young antelope. When Lobo is 6 months old, he starts to hunt with the family pack. But rather than buffalo, the wolves' prey are the herds of cattle being driven across the desert. The cattlemen seek revenge on the wolves, and eventually kill Lobo's parents. Winter comes, and Lobo branches off on his own for the first time. In spring, Lobo joins a new pack, defeats its leader, and takes a mate. He and his pack continue to prey on the cattle that have replaced the buffalo, but is wise enough to avoid all signs of the angry cattlemen who post rewards for his capture - or his death. When the time comes for his pack to split up to mate and raise their pups, Lobo and his mate find a uniquely secure den in an abandoned dwelling that is accessible only by a precarious bridge. As Lobo continues to feed on their property, the cattlemen's feud with him escalates. To catch the wolves, a professional hunter from Texas brings his pack of tracking hounds: a bloodhound and the coonhounds - Black and Tan, Bluetick, Redbone, and Treeing Walker), and his killer wolfhound. He sets a trap for Lobo and manages to snare Lobo's mate and use her as a lure. But Lobo leads his pack to create a cattle stampede, a diversion that enables him to liberate his mate and strike out for unsettled territory.

Work  Between 1704 and 1706, Diesbach was working as a paint manufacturer in Berlin, Germany. He was using an extract of crushed cochineal insects, iron sulphate and potash to create cochineal red lake. One batch of the product unexpectedly turned pale pink. When he tried to concentrate the mixture, it turned purple, then deep blue. He sought out the seller of the potash, Johann Conrad Dippel, an alchemist. Together, they realized that the reaction had occurred because the potash had been contaminated with bone oil. Neither Diesbach nor Dippel knew what exactly happened chemically, they had inadvertently created the first modern synthetic pigment. This was an important invention, because at that time, the available blue pigments were either not very successful or were not affordable for large scale use. The pigment was first mentioned in a letter, the first of several, from Frisch to the president of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, dated March 1708. By August 1709, the pigment was being referred to as \\"Preussisch blau\\" and by November of that year, as \\"Berlinisch Blau\\".

With a Union Jack flying over the sinking yacht in surrender, the flotilla launched lifeboats to rescue the crew of Glasgow which would lie at the bottom of Zanzibar Town Harbour until 1912. She served in the Channel Fleet. In 1901, she was one of two escort ships for the royal yacht , which carried the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) during their tour of the British Empire. Following the end of this tour, the captain of Ophir, Commodore Alfred Winsloe, reverted to his position as Commodore commanding the Cruiser squadron, and was in late 1901 posted to St George, which thus became the lead ship of the squadron and carried his broad pennant. In May 1902 she was taken into Portsmouth for a refit. She took part in the fleet review at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and in September that year was part of a squadron visiting Nauplia and Crete for combined manoeuvres in the Mediterranean Sea. After her return to Portsmouth in late October, she paid off on 15 November and her crew was transferred to . She was the flagship of the Cape & West Africa Station (Rear-Admiral Harry Rawson) based at Simon's Town, and served in the First World War. She was designated as a depot ship in 1909, and sold for breaking up at Plymouth on 1 July 1920. List of Captains * Captain Paul W. Bush, 26 February 1901 - ? * Captain Sidney R.

It was the first modern tragedy written on classical principles, and along with Sperone Speroni's Canace, was responsible for a sixteenth-century theoretical debate on theater, especially with regards to decorum. It was produced in Ferrara in 1541, with incidental music composed by Alfonso della Vivuola and sets by the painter Girolamo da Carpi. Ercole II d'Este was present at the premiere, which took place at the playwright's house. The play was printed in 1543, with several additions for the reader's benefit. Though the play followed Aristotelian principles in terms of structure, thematically it was Senecan, featuring vengeance, rage, hate, and the depiction of violence. Plot The main character, Orbecche, is the daughter of the Persian king Sulmone. She is the mother of two children and the wife of Oronte, whom she married very young, unbeknownst to her father. Sulmone only discovers the existence of the secret marriage and the children many years later, the day he decides to give Orbecche's hand in marriage to another prince. The discovery of the \\"betrayal\\" of his daughter, who has acted against his paternal authority, wounds his pride. The king's terrible revenge has as its goal the restoration of his lost majesty and the legitimacy of the state. This revenge is the prime mover of the action and provokes the catastrophe in the story. At the beginning of the play, a short prologue informs the spectators of the existence of an ulterior hubris, referring back to an event from Orbecche's infancy: as a child she was indirectly responsible for the murder of her mother and brother. Orbecche and Sulmone are characters moved by opposing values: the first, by freedom to feel real emotions (love above all); the second by the good of the state and the social order. Sulmone devises a plan of pitiless revenge: he pretends to pardon Orbecche and to accept that what's done is done (the marriage and heirs) with the goal of pulling the children to him. He invites over his daughter and her family and announces to Oronte his intention of making him heir to the throne. It's a cruel trick; shortly after he has him arrested and condemned to death for treason. Oronte is brought to the castle dungeon, where Sulmone cuts off his hands and then kills both his children in front of his eyes, then kills him. The king's violence continues with his desecration of the corpses, then his revenge turns against Orbecche. She too is the victim of a trick: he shows her affection and presents her a \\"wedding gift\\", a mysterious \\"surprise\\". It is the corpses of her children with the head of her husband on a silver platter, covered by a cloth that she herself is invited to lift, to discover \\"the truth\\" for herself. Orbecche, confronted by this, is devastated by desperation, but in her turn decides to take her revenge using the same method, that is, betrayal. She is able to regain her father's trust and pretends to reconcile with him, taking advantage of the situation (an affectionate embrace between the two) to stab him. Orbecche assumes power at the death of the king, according to the laws of the state. Now, however, she is alone in the world, after the extermination of her family. Her pain is unbearable and, with her act of violence, she feels that she has betrayed herself or rather all the values that her character represents. With no more identity, and desiring no longer to hold on to a life with no sense, the queen commits suicide. One last suicide closes the tragedy: that of Orbecche's nurse. The woman who nursed her as a child is the first important character to appear in the play, and the last. The nurse is forced to witness the death of Orbecche in the last scene, in which the mood is of struggling affection, as in the beginning. Such symmetry in the plot completes the darkness of the tragedy. References See also *Erofili External links * ‚Äì text made available by Ferrara city council, available on University of Pisa site.

In contrast, single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) involves a single multi- antenna-equipped user or terminal communicating with precisely one other similarly equipped node. Analogous to how OFDMA adds multiple-access capability to OFDM in the cellular-communications realm, MU-MIMO adds multiple-user capability to MIMO in the wireless realm. SDMA,N.

Technology MU-MIMO leverages multiple users as spatially distributed transmission resources, at the cost of somewhat more expensive signal processing. In comparison, conventional single- user MIMO (SU-MIMO) involves solely local-device multiple-antenna dimensions. MU-MIMO algorithms enhance MIMO systems where connections among users count greater than one. MU-MIMO may be generalized into two categories: MIMO broadcast channels (MIMO BC) and MIMO multiple-access channels (MIMO MAC) for downlink and uplink situations, respectively. Again in comparison, SU-MIMO may be represented as a point-to-point, pairwise MIMO. To remove ambiguity of the words receiver and transmitter, we can adopt the terms access point (AP) or base station, and user. An AP is the transmitter and a user the receiver for downlink connections, and vice versa for uplink connections. Homogeneous networks are freed from this distinction since they tend to be bi-directional. MIMO broadcast (MIMO BC) Multiuser MIMO System: MIMO BC case Example of the block diagonalized real value channel matrix (8 transmit antennas at the base station, 3 user equipments). MIMO BC represents a MIMO downlink case where a single sender transmits to multiple receivers within the wireless network. Examples of advanced-transmit processing for MIMO BC are interference-aware precoding and SDMA-based downlink user scheduling. For advanced-transmit processing, qfz has to be known at the transmitter (CSIT). That is, knowledge of CSIT allows throughput improvement, and methods to obtain CSIT become of significant importance. MIMO BC systems have an outstanding advantage over point-to-point SU-MIMO systems, especially when the number of antennas at the transmitter, or AP, is larger than the number of antennas at each receiver (user). The categories of precoding techniques which may be used by MIMO BC include, one, those using dirty paper coding (DPC) and linear techniques and two, hybrid (analog and digital) techniques.Vizziello, A., Savazzi, P., & Chowdhury, K. R. (2018). A Kalman Based Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems. IEEE Access, 6, 55712-55722. MIMO MAC Conversely, the MIMO multiple-access-channel or MIMO MAC represents a MIMO uplink case in the multiple sender to single receiver wireless network. Examples of advanced receive processing for MIMO MAC are joint interference cancellation and SDMA-based uplink user scheduling. For advanced receive processing, the receiver has to know the channel state information at the receiver (CSIR). Knowing CSIR is generally easier than knowing CSIT. However, knowing CSIR costs a lot of uplink resources to transmit dedicated pilots from each user to the AP. MIMO MAC systems outperforms point-to-point MIMO systems especially when the number of receiver antennas at an AP is larger than the number of transmit antennas at each user. Cross-layer MIMO Cross-layer MIMO enhances the performance of MIMO links by solving certain cross-layer problems that may occur when MIMO configurations are employed in a system. Cross-layer techniques can be used to enhance the performance of SISO links as well. Examples of cross-layer techniques are Joint Source-Channel Coding, Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC, or \\"Link Adaptation\\"), Hybrid ARQ (HARQ), and user scheduling. Multi- user to multi-user The highly interconnected wireless ad hoc network increases the flexibility of wireless networking at the cost of increased multi-user interference. To improve the interference immunity, PHY/MAC-layer protocols have evolved from competition based to cooperative based transmission and reception. Cooperative wireless communications can actually exploit interference, which includes self-interference and other user interference. In cooperative wireless communications, each node might use self-interference and other user interference to improve the performance of data encoding and decoding, whereas conventional nodes are generally directed to avoid the interference. For example, once strong interference is decodable, a node decodes and cancels the strong interference before decoding the self- signal. The mitigation of low Carrier over Interference (CoI) ratios can be implemented across PHY/MAC/Application network layers in cooperative systems. * Cooperative multiple antenna research ‚Äì Apply multiple antenna technologies in situations with antennas distributed among neighboring wireless terminals. ** Cooperative diversity ‚Äì Achieve antenna diversity gain by the cooperation of distributed antennas belonging to each independent node. ** Cooperative MIMO ‚Äì Achieve MIMO advantages, including the spatial multiplexing gain, using the transmit or receiver cooperation of distributed antennas belonging to many different nodes. * Cooperative relay ‚Äì Apply cooperative concepts onto relay techniques, which is similar to cooperative diversity in terms of cooperative signalling. However, the main criterion of cooperative relay is to improve the tradeoff region between delay and performance, while that of cooperative diversity and MIMO is to improve the link and system performance at the expense of minimal cooperation loss. * Relaying techniques for cooperation ** Store-and-forward (S&F;), Amplify-and-forward (A&F;), Decode-and-forward (D&F;), Coded cooperation, Spatial coded cooperation, Compress-and-forward (C&F;), Non-orthogonal methods = Cooperative MIMO (CO-MIMO) = CO-MIMO, also known as network MIMO (net-MIMO), or ad hoc MIMO, uses distributed antennas which belong to other users, while conventional MIMO, i.e., single- user MIMO, only employs antennas belonging to the local terminal. CO-MIMO improves the performance of a wireless network by introducing multiple antenna advantages, such as diversity, multiplexing and beamforming. If the main interest hinges on the diversity gain, it is known as cooperative diversity. It can be described as a form of macro-diversity, used for example in soft handover. Cooperative MIMO corresponds to transmitter macro-diversity or simulcasting. A simple form that does not require any advanced signal processing is single frequency networks (SFN), used especially in wireless broadcasting. SFNs combined with channel adaptive or traffic adaptive scheduling is called dynamic single frequency networks (DSFN). CO-MIMO is a technique useful for future cellular networks which consider wireless mesh networking or wireless ad hoc networking. In wireless ad hoc networks, multiple transmit nodes communicate with multiple receive nodes. To optimize the capacity of ad hoc channels, MIMO concepts and techniques can be applied to multiple links between the transmit and receive node clusters. Contrasted to multiple antennas in a single-user MIMO transceiver, participating nodes and their antennas are located in a distributed manner. So, to achieve the capacity of this network, techniques to manage distributed radio resources are essential. Strategies such as autonomous interference cognition, node cooperation, and network coding with dirty paper coding have been suggested to optimize wireless network capacity.

Geography Langon is in the region of Brittany, close to the border with the Pays de Loire region. It is located from Redon, from Rennes (the capital of Brittany), and from Nantes and Saint Nazaire. The Vilaine river, which flows through Vitr√© and Rennes, borders the territory of Langon over a distance of 14 km, then flows on into the Atlantic ocean. Langon has one of the best preserved pastoral countrysides in all of Brittany. History The earliest traces of human activity on the territory of present-day Langon date back to around 10,000 BCE, in the Mesolithic era. By the end of the 19th century, 35 megalithic groupings had been discovered, many of which have since been razed. The city's Roman heritage is evidenced in the Chapelle Ste Agathe, the villa de Balac, and a stretch of paved road. The first Christian communities established themselves in the area starting at the end of the 5th century. The town was built around the chapel. Starting in the 9th century, the history of the village becomes intertwined with that of the Abbey of Redon. It is in the records of this Abbey that the name of the parish is written using various Latin spellings (\\"Langedon\\", \\"Langeco\\", \\"Lanco\\", and \\"Lancon\\"). Langon found itself at the very edge of Brittany, when the Vilaine river became the border between the Breton territory and the French territory. In the 19th century, the arrival of the railroad through town brought a dynamic economic development and prosperity that had never been experienced. It was during this time that the village took on the look and feel that persists in much of the town to this day. World War II brought an abrupt end to this development. Population Inhabitants of Langon are called Langonnais in French. Sights Roman fresco from the Chapelle de Sainte Agathe Langon is distinctive because of its archeological heritage. Many different eras of history are represented in the surrounding area: the Neolithic with the town's megaliths, the Roman era with the Chapelle de Sainte Agathe and a segment of a Roman road in the town, the Modern Era with its numerous mansions, the Corbini√®res viaduct and, 2 kilometres to the north, the Porte de la Roche (a monument commemorating the villagers shot by the retreating German army near the end of World War II). The chapelle Sainte- Agathe, with a history of 18 centuries, is famous for the Roman paintings on the inside. It was originally built as a Gallo-Roman spa at the end of the 2nd century, then converted to a church in the Middle Ages (6th-7th centuries). It was used as a funerary chapel in the 10th century. To this day, a Roman fresco depicting Venus emerging from the water and surrounded by all sorts of fish has survived.R. Royer, \\"Un monument gallo-romain en Armorique, la chappelle de Langon,\\" Archaeologia, tresors des ages 1981, no. 157: 16-21. There are a number of megaliths in Langon and in the surrounding area (particularly in the neighboring town of [St. Just]). One such arrangement has been named the \\"Demoiselles de Langon\\", or the \\"Damsels of Langon\\". The arrangement consists of around 20 stones, averaging around 1 metre (3 ft) in height. The Corbinieres viaduct spans the Vilaine river. More than 30 metres high, it links Langon to Messac. It was completed in 1861. The viaduct has distinctive skewed arches. For this reason, it is considered to be one of the most attractive viaducts in France. In addition, its pillars house an important bat colony.

As such it has become one of largest cultural organizations in the world.Langels, Otto: \\"Constitutional Reality: 50 years of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation\\", in German, Deutschlandradio, 25 July 2007 As of 2020, it is also the largest cultural employer in Germany with around 2,000 employees and a 2020 budget of 336 million euros.Catherine Hickley (July 8, 2020), Panel recommends dissolution of 'dysfunctional' Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation The Art Newspaper. The Federal Government and the German States are jointly responsible for the Foundation, both legally and financially. Its operations include preservation and care of the collections, their structure and development, and the continuation of academic and scientific research with a mission to encourage learning and understanding between different peoples. History During World War II, the cultural artifacts and fine arts in Prussia, especially in Berlin, came under increasing threat of loss. To protect them from Allied bombing, millions of items were evacuated to relative safety in monasteries, castles and abandoned mines around Germany starting in 1941. With the collapse of the Third Reich in 1945, many of these collections wound up damaged, destroyed, or variously hidden in the Allied occupation zones. All the former Prussian institutions ceased to officially exist when the State of Prussia was abolished in 1947, placing these assets in further doubt. As Germany became divided into West and East, what remained of the buildings and scattered collections were also separated by the Iron Curtain. The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation began in 1957 by a West German constitutional mandate to find and preserve the collections still stored throughout the former western occupation zones. In 1961, efforts began to move these materials to West Berlin. From the mid-1960s onward, a series of Modernist buildings were constructed at the Kulturforum to serve as new homes for the collections, including the Gem√§ldegalerie, the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Berlin State Library. Upon German Reunification in 1990, the Foundation's role expanded considerably to encompass many of the most important cultural properties of the former East Germany. The most important tasks today are in the consolidation of collections, reconstruction of physical space, conservation-restoration and Provenance research. In 2018, Minister of State for Culture and Media Monika Gr√ºtters appointed a panel which was commissioned with a report on the future of the Foundation. By 2020, the panel proposed dissolving the Foundation and instead creating four separate foundations with separate management: one to oversee the Berlin state museums, one for the Staatsbibliothek (State Library), another for the Geheime Staatsarchiv (Secret State Archive) and a fourth for the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut (Iberian-American Institute). It also proposed reorganising the foundation‚Äôs finances.Catherine Hickley (July 8, 2020), Panel recommends dissolution of 'dysfunctional' Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation The Art Newspaper. Buildings Domicile of the president and the administrative center in Berlin-Tiergarten In 1980 the Foundation's headquarters moved into a historic building at Von-der-Heydt-Stra√üe 16. The Villa Von Der Heydt was built between 1860 and 1862 in neo-renaissance style by the architect Hermann Ende for Baron August von der Heydt, who was Minister of Finance under Otto von Bismarck in the last Prussian cabinet before the founding of the German Empire in 1871. After Von der Heydt's death in 1874 the building became home to the first Chinese ambassador to Wilhelm II, who decorated its splendid rooms with valuable works of art. In 1938 the villa was bought by the Nazi government and used as an official residence by Hans Lammers, Cabinet Minister in the Reich Chancellery. The house was severely damaged in World War II, with only the basement and the outer walls remaining. In the immediate post-war years it was occupied by a sweets factory and an illicit still. The villa's gloomy ruins also once formed the backdrop for a spy film. It was not until 1971 that plans for reconstruction of the building began under the aegis of the German Federal Buildings Authority. Renovations completed in 1980. The Foundation has since expanded operations to a new office building at Von-der- Heydt-Stra√üe 16 .

He is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who occasionally bowls right arm medium-fast. He played for Lancashire from 2005 until his release in 2013, and the following year signed for Derbyshire. In 2015 he returned to Clifton as professional having earlier come through their junior ranks. Cross briefly started his cricket at Roe Green Cricket Club in Worsley, before moving to Clifton Salford. Cross made his first-class debut in 2005. Lancashire's stalwart wicketkeeper Warren Hegg retired at the end of the season, and the signing of Luke Sutton in the off-season limited Cross' first- team opportunities. Despite the competition he established himself as a regular in the one-day side, although he struggled to break into the County Championship team. In 2009 Cross captained the Second XI, leading them to the semi-final of the Second XI Trophy. Sutton left in late 2010, leaving Cross as Lancashire's first-choice wicketkeeper. He was part of the Lancashire squad that won the 2011 County Championship and achieved the rare feat of being ever-present in a championship winning side, but left the club at the end of the 2013 season and after a short time with Cheshire in early 2014 signed to play for Derbyshire. Career =Lancashire= Cross made his debut for the Second XI a week and a half before his 18th birthday, in a game against Durham. He continued to play List A cricket for three years prior to his first-class debut. Having graduated from Lancashire's Academy, 2005 was Cross' first year with the senior squad. Lancashire's veteran wicket-keeper Hegg was impressed by Cross, and said \\"He has a really good work ethic, and he listens when you talk about the game. He's the one in line to take over from me.\\" Cross made his first-class debut on 25 May 2005, along with Steven Croft and Tom Smith in a match against Oxford University. He batted just once in the match, scoring two runs, although he dismissed five batsmen, one by stumping and four caught. His second opportunity to play first-class cricket came in the last match of the season; with Lancashire's stalwart Warren Hegg injured, Cross was given the responsibility of taking over as wicket-keeper. Playing in the County Championship for the first time, according to The Wisden Cricketer Cross \\"showed enough pure technique to deserve his chance to develop\\". Although Hegg retired at the end of the season, Lancashire quickly signed experienced wicket-keeper Luke Sutton from Derbyshire, hampering Cross' chances to regularly play first-team cricket. In the 2005/06 Australian cricket season, Cross travelled to the southern hemisphere to play for St Kilda Cricket Club in the Victorian Premier Cricket. He spent most of the season playing for the club's second team. Having won the second division title in 2005, for the 2006 season Lancashire were playing in the first division of the County Championship. A successful first season for Suttonin which he broke the record for highest score by a Lancashire 'keeper and had a batting average of 61meant that Cross spent most of 2006 playing for the Second XI. However, he was given a chance in the first team when Luke Sutton broke his thumb in July. Cross played three Championship matches before Sutton returned, managing half-centuries against Kent and Sussex. This was the season that Cross made his Twenty20 (T20) debut; he played eight matches for Lancashire, scoring 61 runs at an average of 8.71 with a highest score of 36. Lancashire were runners-up in the Championship and C&G; Trophy, although went out in the first round of the T20 Cup. Spanning the 2007 and 2008 seasons, Cross's first-class experience was limited to two matches, one at the start of each season against Durham University. However, Cross regularly featured in Lancashire's one-day side. Sutton did not play a single T20 match in the 2007 season, so Cross kept wicket in his place. During the same season, he also opened the batting a few times in the 40-over competition as a specialist batsman. In six T20 matches, Cross scored 113 runs at an average of 22.60 with a highest score of 62, his first half-century in T20 cricket; he also dismissed seven people, four caught and three stumped. An attacking batsman, Cross showcased his batting ability in an innings of 76 off 69 balls against Warwickshire in a Pro40 match to help Lancashire to victory. It was Cross' maiden half-century for Lancashire in list A cricket, beating his previous highest score of 36. Lancashire-batsman Mal Loye identified Cross as a talented cricketer with the potential to play for England, remarking that \\"His natural ability is just unbelievable\\". Relative to 2007, Cross had less impact in 2008. Although he played more list A cricket, he scored fewer runs than in the previous year. He played eleven T20 matches, scoring 97 runs at an average of 24.25 and affecting eleven dismissals, seven caught and four stumped. In September, towards the end of the 2008 season, Cross was one of ten players from Lancashire's Development Programme to extend or sign contracts with the club. The group was expected to form the basis of the senior squad in the future. Cross played for the St Kilda Saints in Australia as a batsman in the 2008/09 season. He won the prestigious Jack Ryder Medal, presented to the Player of the Year in Victorian Premier Cricket. During his stint with the club, Cross scored 541 runs at an average of 41, with a highest score of 111. Although primarily a batsman, Cross occasionally bowled, taking six wickets with best figures of 4/41. He was surprised to receive the award, and said that \\"This was my fourth spell with St Kilda and each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my cricket. I set myself a challenge this winter of focusing on my batting, improving my technique and doing my best for the club. Everything seemed to click and I was very happy with my own performance and that of the team. My focus now is to continue to do well during Lancashire's pre-season fixtures, and push for first team selection.\\" Despite his promising winter, Cross was less successful in the 2009 season than desired: he did not play any first-class cricket and scored fewer runs in the one-day competitions than hoped. However, Cross captained Lancashire's second XI and was a regular in their top order. Under his leadership, the team progressed to the final of the Second XI Championship and the semi-final of the Second XI Trophy. Two years after he last played a first-class match, Cross returned to the County Championship team in July 2010. With Luke Sutton acting as wicket-keeper and batting at seven, Cross played as a specialist batsman. Playing against Hampshire, he batted at six; he scored his maiden century, beating his previous best score of 70, to help Lancashire draw. Cross was reprimanded in August for showing dissent in a second XI match. Sutton left the club towards the end of the season, and Cross was expected to take the position of Lancashire's first-choice wicketkeeper. At the start of 2011, Cross was the only wicket-keeper with a first-team contract at Lancashire. The club had a small squad, just 19 players at the start of the season and choosing to place their trust in young local players, which led some pundits to declare that Lancashire would be fighting to avoid relegation form the County Championship. Speaking in March of his aims for the coming season, Cross stated that \\"if I got below 700 runs from No.7, I'd be really disappointed\\". During a match against Sussex in April 2011, Cross beat his highest score in first-class cricket. His innings of 125 came from 195 balls. During a match against Nottinghamshire in June, Cross reached the landmark of 1,000 first-class runs in his career. In the last match of the season, Lancashire won the County Championship first the first time since 1950 when they shared the title. Cross played in all 16 of Lancashire's County Championship matches, scoring 557 runs, taking 46 catches, and effecting 10 stumpings. The year after winning the County Championship, Lancashire were relegated to the second division. Cross played in all 16 of Lancashire's Championship matches that year, scoring 547 runs including three haljf-centuries, with a highest score of 74 not out. Cross scored his third first-class century during a drawn match against Hampshire in May 2013, his first in two years. Though Lancashire secured immediate promotion back to the first division of the Championship through winning the second division title, Cross was dropped for the final two matches of the season as Alex Davies was preferred to keep wicket. In September, after scoring 409 runs from 13 Championship matches that year, Cross was released from his contract with the club. =Derbyshire= After being released by Lancashire, Cross signed to play for 2013 Minor Counties Championship winners Cheshire. As well as playing for Nantwich at the same time, Cross had a trial with Derbyshire in April 2014. Consequently, when the club's contracted wicketkeepers ‚Äì Tom Poynton and Richard Johnson ‚Äì became unavailable to play Cross was signed to from May until the end of the season.

He was born in Chicago on November 26, 1918, to Howard and Harriet (n√©e Erickson) DeCorrevont and began both his football and baseball career at the now-defunct Austin High School on Chicago's West Side.Northwestern University Archives, William DeCorrevont Papers. Retrieved 2013-08-13. Austin High School =1936 season= By the 1936 football season, DeCorrevont was one of Austin's best players and a Chicago-area football star. That year, DeCorrevont helped Austin to defeat rival Tilden High School 31‚Äì13 for the Chicago Public School League championship, qualifying them for Chicago Mayor Edward J. Kelly's annual Christmas charity match. The game, which pitted Chicago's Catholic School League champion, Fenwick High School, against the Public School League Champion, Austin High School, brought an estimated 90,000 spectators to Soldier Field. DeCorrevont scored a touchdown and ended the game in a tie (19‚Äì19). At the time of the 1937 Christmas Prep Game, more than 120,000 people overcrowded Soldier Field's 76,000-person capacity and flooded the surrounding area =1937 season= In 1937, Austin High School beat McKinley High School 93-0, a new record, after DeCorrevont scored 9 touchdowns in 10 carries and kicked 3 extra points for a personal total of 57 points. His performance in the game gained him a spot in Ripley's Believe It or Not! On March 16, 1942, DeCorrevont enlisted in the United States Navy and served as a Chief Petty Officer (Class A) until the end of the World War II in 1945. During his service, DeCorrevont was stationed for a time at the Great Lakes Naval Base just north of Northwestern, a base in Virginia, and a base in Bainbridge, Maryland. He also played football sporadically for the official Navy team. 1937 Christmas charity game On November 27, 1937, DeCorrevont and Austin High School, the Public League champion, faced Leo Catholic High School, the Catholic League champion, for Mayor Kelly's annual charity game played at Soldier Field. At that time, Soldier Field had only about 76,000 seats, but managed to hold a record-breaking crowd, estimated at nearly 120,000, that turned out to watch DeCorrevont face off against Leo's star, Johnny Galvin. In the game, DeCorrevont ran three touchdowns, one for 47 yards, and passed for a fourth, leading Austin to a resounding victory, 26-0. The game garnered so much publicity for DeCorrevont that his broken collarbone (injured that December) gained mention in both the Chicago Tribune and The New York Times. Northwestern A native Chicagoan, DeCorrevont did not want to stray too far from home, his widowed mother, or his high school sweetheart, for college. He chose Northwestern University for both its proximity to Chicago and its strong academic reputation, a choice which was possibly also aided by his familial connections to Wildcat football. One older cousin, George Wilson, had played as an end in the mid-1930s, and another, Jack Riley, had been an acclaimed football captain and All-American tackle at Northwestern in the 1930s as well. Enrolling at Northwestern alongside him were four former teammates from Austin: Alf Bauman, Sonny Skor, Chuck Feingarten, and Donald Johnson. DeCorrevont matriculated at Northwestern in 1938 and started playing on Northwestern's football and baseball teams his freshman year. He joined the Sigma Chi fraternity, as did his brother Howard \\"Bud\\" DeCorrevont (1917‚Äì1997) who attended Northwestern at the same time. Otto Graham, another famous Northwestern football player, joined the team in 1940 when DeCorrevont was a sophomore. NFL career While still in the Navy, DeCorrevont was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the fourteenth round of the 1942 NFL Draft, which was held in Chicago that year. However, did not begin to play professionally until his military service ended in 1945. After a year playing as a running back for the Redskins, DeCorrevont was traded to the Detroit Lions as a quarterback in 1946, again to the (then) Chicago Cardinals in 1947, and again to the Chicago Bears for his last two years of professional football (1948‚Äì49). Throughout his professional career, DeCorrevont rushed for 233 yards, had 10 interceptions, and scored three touchdowns.

A former amateur sumo champion, he turned professional in 2002, reaching the top makuuchi division the following year. He was a runner-up in one tournament, earned two special prizes for Fighting Spirit, and one gold star for defeating a yokozuna. Takekaze is in first place for the slowest promotion from makuuchi debut to the third highest sekiwake rank in history. Aged 35 years and 2 months, he is in first place for the eldest to make his sekiwake debut post World War II. He was a member of Oguruma stable. He retired in January 2019 to become an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Oshiogawa Oyakata. Early life and sumo background Born in Moriyoshi, Kitaakita District, Narita practised sumo in college and was a very dominant player, having achieved the student equivalent of yokozuna after winning the Kokutai (Japan Games) and All Japan University Championship sumo tournaments in 2001, his fourth year at Chuo University. He made his professional debut in May 2002, joining former ≈çzeki Kotokaze's Oguruma stable. Career Upon entry he was given makushita tsukedashi status and allowed to enter at the rank of makushita 15 due to his amateur achievements. He reached sekitori level in just two tournaments, and was promoted to the top makuuchi division in March 2003, the first wrestler from his stable to achieve this. Takekaze had to pull out of his debut tournament in the top division due to injury and fell back to the j≈´ry≈ç division. However upon winning the j≈´ry≈ç championship in September 2003 with a 13‚Äì2 record he was promoted back to the top division. He took time to adjust to the stronger opposition in makuuchi and did not achieve a kachi-koshi or winning record above the mid maegashira ranks until May 2007. However, in January 2008 he produced his best score in the top division, 12‚Äì3, which included a defeat of ≈çzeki Koto≈çsh≈´. He was awarded his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit. Consequently, in the March, 2008 tournament he debuted at the komusubi rank, finally breaking into san'yaku. He was the first wrestler from his stable to make the titled ranks. Takekaze in May 2009. Takekaze could manage only three wins in his komusubi debut and was demoted to maegashira 8 for the May 2008 tournament. However, an 8‚Äì7 score at maegashira 4 in March 2009, which included a defeat of ≈çzeki Kotomitsuki, saw him climb to maegashira 2 for the May 2009 tournament. He also reached maegashira 1 in November 2009. In September 2010 he finished runner-up in a tournament for the first time, and was awarded his second Fighting Spirit prize, shared with stablemate Yoshikaze. In July 2014 Takekaze earned his first kinboshi or gold star for a defeat of a yokozuna with a win over Harumafuji. His 9‚Äì6 score at maegashira 4 was enough to earn him promotion to sekiwake for the first time, as everyone else in the division from sekiwake down to maegashira 3 had a losing score, with the exception of sekiwake G≈çeid≈ç who was promoted to ≈çzeki. Not only did Takekaze become the oldest sekiwake debutant since the end of World War II at the age of 35 years two months, but the 64 tournaments it took to reach the sekiwake rank from his top division debut is also a record. He performed creditably in the September 2014 tournament, only just missing out on kachi- koshi with a 7‚Äì8 record. He remained in the san'yaku ranks at komusubi for the following tournament in November, but could only score 2‚Äì13. In 2015 he managed only two winning tournaments and dropped down the rankings. By January 2016 he had fallen to maegashira 13, his lowest rank for seven years but secured his top division status with a 10‚Äì5 result. He went on to secure four winning records out of six tournaments in 2016. In September 2017 Takekaze appeared in his 83rd top division tournament, a record for a college graduate and 10th all-time. He has also fought more top division matches than any other former amateur champion and is in the top ten all-time. His 5‚Äì10 record in the January 2018 tournament saw him demoted to j≈´ry≈ç for the first time since 2005, but he resolved to continue wrestling, and earned immediate promotion back to makuuchi, becoming at 38 years and 10 months the second oldest wrestler to do so since the beginning of the Showa era after Aminishiki. However he lasted only one tournament and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç after the May 2018 basho. Retirement from sumo He announced his retirement during the January 2019 tournament after his eighth loss at the low rank of j≈´ry≈ç 12 made demotion to the makushita division virtually certain. He is the owner of the Oshiogawa toshiyori kabu and is staying in sumo as a coach at Oguruma stable.

Fighting style Takekaze was almost entirely reliant on oshi-sumo or pushing techniques, and usually lost if his opponents grabbed hold of his mawashi or belt. He commented, \\"Sumo at the mawashi is not my style ‚Äì I haven't learned to do it.\\" He has won only around four percent of his career matches by yori- kiri (force out), which is the most popular overall technique in sumo. As well as oshi-dashi (push out) he also regularly employed hiki-otoshi, the pull- down, and tsuki-otoshi, the thrust over. At just 172 cm (5 ft in) he was of the shortest wrestlers in the top division. Personal life Takekaze was married in August 2006. He has a son, born at the end of 2007.

It is proposed to make the design, configuration, deployment and management of distributed systems easier, correct and automatic. SmartFrog mainly consists of three aspects: SmartFrog Language, a runtime system, and a library of SmartFrog components that implement the SmartFrog component model.  History  SmartFrog was originally developed in Hewlett-Packard's European Research Labs. It has been used in HP research on infrastructure automation and service automation as well as in a variety of HP products. SmartFrog became open to public in January 2004 under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) licence hosted on SourceForge. As a result, users and developers outside the lab can also make their contributions by using, extending the framework or reporting bugs.  Technologies  = SmartFrog Language = SmartFrog Language is a configuration description language used for describing component collections and system configurations, such as which software components belong to the system, what the configuration parameters are, how the components are bound to other components in the system, and in what sequence the components work. = Component model = In SmartFrog, component is the most important and basic part. A system is considered to be a collection of applications, each of which are composed by a collection of components. Every component is written in a SmartFrog file in Java, which represents the existence and default attributes of components. = Runtime system = The runtime system interprets the descriptions written in SmartFrog Language and manages the components based on the interpretation results. It also provides users with tools to interact with components.  Features  = As a framework = Instead of a package or library, SmartFrog is a framework, a building block to help build software systems. SmartFrog can be extended by adding new components into the framework, which means it has much wider applicability and could acquire new functionality. = Template mechanism = In SmartFrog, every component is defined as a template. Typically for every new service, new components are created and activated. However, some general purpose components can be reused in different service. For the template mechanism, system configuration is easy to adapt to different requirements and the default configuration can be kept. Prototyping also allows keeping all the transformation and history of configurations of the system. Using SmartFrog to build large-scale distributed system, one can reuse some components and doesn‚Äôt need to completely rewrite the whole application. Users can easily write or create simple SmartFrog components to install, uninstall, configure, start, and stop the system using the configuration description notation. = Cross-client model = There are many software system similar to SmartFrog, but few of them uses the same model as what is used in SmartFrog. The largest category of systems is based on client-server model, where the configuration data for all clients are held in a server and each client is designed to match the configuration data stored in the server. However, in SmartFrog, cross-client model is used so that each client is treated as an independent entity. This provides SmartFrog with the ability to coordinate across large range of nodes, carry out autonomic actions and result in higher scalability.  Security  SmartFrog has two running modes: secure and insecure. In insecure mode, there is no restriction on client connection to SmartFrog, and the plain-text communication can be eavesdropped and intercepted. In this mode, the system is vulnerable to malign attacks. SmartFrog needs to protect against malign deployment or other management action. In secure mode, SmartFrog uses public key infrastructure (PKI) system. Only clients that are certificated by specified certificate authority (CA) can connect to the SmartFrog Daemon. In addition, SmartFrog signs all components and descriptions with a certificate and only the signed ones can be deployed. Communications are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.  Related project  The GridWeaver Project The GridWeaver project started at 2002 and lasted a year. The project collaborators were the School of Informatics of Edinburgh University, HP Laboratories, and Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC).This project was aimed to find solutions to the problems of automating the configuration and management of the next generation of Grid computing fabrics. The project compared SmartFrog and Local ConFiGuration system (LCFG) in terms of strengths and weaknesses, as well as investigating how these tools are utilized to solve problems.

D, subepithelial connective tissue. E, oral epithelium. H, principal gingival fibers. I, alveolar crest fibers of the PDL. J, horizontal fibers of the PDL. K, oblique fibers of the PDL. Gingival and periodontal pockets (also informally referred to as gum pockets) are dental terms indicating the presence of an abnormal depth of the gingival sulcus near the point at which the gingival tissue contacts the tooth. Tooth gingival interface The interface between a tooth and the surrounding gingival tissue is a dynamic structure.Fermin A. Carranza. CARRANZA'S CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY, 9th edition, 2002. page 101 The gingival tissue forms a crevice surrounding the tooth, similar to a miniature, fluid-filled moat, wherein food debris, endogenous and exogenous cells, and chemicals float. The depth of this crevice, known as a sulcus, is in a constant state of flux due to microbial invasion and subsequent immune response. Located at the depth of the sulcus is the epithelial attachment, consisting of approximately 1 mm of junctional epithelium and another 1 mm of gingival fiber attachment, comprising the 2 mm of biologic width naturally found in the oral cavity. The sulcus is literally the area of separation between the surrounding epithelium and the surface of the encompassed tooth. Gingival pocket A gingival pocket presents when the marginal gingiva experiences an edematous reaction, whether due to localized irritation and subsequent inflammation, systemic issues, or drug induced gingival hyperplasia. Regardless of the etiology, when gingival hyperplasia occurs, greater than normal (the measurement in a pre-pathological state) periodontal probing measurements can be read, creating the illusion that periodontal pockets have developed. This phenomenon is also referred to as a false pocket or pseudopocket. The epithelial attachment does not migrate, it simply remains at the same attachment level found in pre-pathological health. The only anatomical landmark experiencing migration is the gingival margin in a coronal direction. In a gingival pocket, no destruction of the connective tissue fibers (gingival fibers) or alveolar bone occurs. This early sign of disease in the mouth is completely reversible when the etiology of the edematous reaction is eliminated and frequently occurs without dental surgical therapy. However, in certain situations, a gingivectomy is necessary to reduce the gingival pocket depths to a healthy 1‚Äì3 mm. Periodontal pocket 1: Total loss of attachment (clinical attachment loss, CAL) is the sum of 2: Gingival recession, and 3: Probing depth As the original sulcular depth increases and the apical migration of the junctional epithelium has simultaneously occurred, the pocket is now lined by pocket epithelium (PE) instead of junctional epithelium (JE).Antonio Nanci, Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Elsevier, 2007, page 383 To have a true periodontal pocket, a probing measurement of 4 mm or more must be clinically evidenced. In this state, much of the gingival fibers that initially attached the gingival tissue to the tooth have been irreversibly destroyed. The depth of the periodontal pockets must be recorded in the patient record for proper monitoring of periodontal disease. Unlike in clinically healthy situations, parts of the sulcular epithelium can sometimes be seen in periodontally involved gingival tissue if air is blown into the periodontal pocket, exposing the newly denuded roots of the tooth. A periodontal pocket can become an infected space and may result in an abscess formation with a papule on the gingival surface. Incision and drainage of the abscess may be necessary, as well as systemic antibiotics; placement of local antimicrobial delivery systems within the periodontal pocket to reduce localized infections may also be considered. It is classified as supra bony and infra bony based on its depth in relation to alveolar bone.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 129 Mucogingival defect If the destruction continues unabated apically and reaches the junction of the attached gingiva and alveolar mucosa, the pocket would thus be in violation of the mucogingival junction and would be termed a mucogingival defect.Carranza's Clinical Periodontology, Newman, et al, Elsevier, 2011  Pocket formation  For the periodontal pocket to form, several elements need to be present. It all starts with the dental plaque . The invasion of the bacteria from the plaque eventually triggers inflammatory response. This in turn results in the gradual destruction of the tissues surrounding the teeth, known as the periodontium. Plaque that has been present long enough to harden and calcify will welcome additional bacteria to the pocket and make it virtually impossible to clean by means of a traditional toothbrush. Continuous destruction of surrounding tissues due to inflammation will lead to degradation of attachment and bone, eventually causing tooth loss. Certain circumstances can worsen the condition and are known as risk factors. These can either be systemic (like diabetes or smoking) or local (like overhanging dental restorative materials causing food trap). It is therefore important to manage plaque levels by appropriate oral hygiene measures. The importance of using interdental brushes along standard or electric toothbrush should be stressed on. Early detection of high plaque levels at routine dental visits are found to be beneficial to avoid progression of the pocket formation.

Her secondary armament of four BL Mark II or Mark V guns in single Mk II turrets was carried amidships, between the wing 9.2-inch guns. Twenty-six Vickers QF 3 pounders were fitted, ten on turret roofs and eight each on the forward and aft superstructures. The last four ships of the cruisers had a secondary armament of turreted 7.5-inch guns rather than the guns in open barbettes of the first two ships; these latter four were sometimes referred to as the Warrior class.Roberts, pp. 34, 36 Because of the extra topweight of the turrets in comparison to their half-sisters their stability was reduced which made them very good seaboats and steady gun platforms. =Wartime modifications= A single Hotchkiss QF 6-pounder anti- aircraft gun on a high-angle Mark Ic mounting was mounted on the quarterdeck in 1915.

The guns on top of 'A' and 'Y' turrets were removed in 1915‚Äì16. The aftermost 3-pounder guns on the superstructure were removed during 1917 as well as the guns on top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Some of these guns were landed at Murmansk while she was based there. Seventeen 3-pounders were on board when she was lost in 1919, but it is unclear if that total includes the AA guns.

The skipjack shad is restricted to the Gulf of Mexico drainage basins. Skipjack shad are found in clear to moderately turbid water in areas with flow. Because they are a migratory species, dams often impede their reproduction. Records suggest that this species was much more abundant in the Upper Mississippi River basin before it was impounded. Currently, the skipjack shad is most abundant in the Upper Mississippi River below the mouth of the Ohio River. They are known as an \\"early-run\\" species as they migrate to spawn in the early spring.Neebling, Travis E., and Quist, Michael C. (2008): on the Distribution and Status of Western Sand Darter, Spotted Gar, and Skipjack Herring in Iowa Rivers.

The Gulf of Mexico drainage includes the Mobile River basin, the ACF (Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint River) basin, the Mississippi basin, and the Rio Grande basin. Records indicate that this species was more abundant in the upper Mississippi River before it was impounded, and currently skipjack shad are most abundant in the upper Mississippi River below the mouth of the Ohio River. In recent years, human modifications to the middle Missouri River have made conditions more favorable for skipjack shad and their distribution has expanded upstream to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Skipjack shad were historically found in the northern upper Mississippi River and the St. Croix River; however, there have only been four records of skipjack shad in Wisconsin waters since the 1950s. Because this fish is a migratory species, dams have diminished its distribution. It cannot continue to migrate northward over dams; therefore it is rare to see a skipjack shad in the upper reaches of the Gulf of Mexico drainages. Ecology Skipjack shad are a migratory schooling species. They are a euryhaline species that can enter brackish and freshwater bodies. They can be anadromous but are not obligated to be because they can complete their life cycle in freshwater. Skipjack shad are strongly migratory within rivers and prefer fast flowing water where they are renowned for leaping. They are found in clear to moderately turbid waters in large rivers and reservoirs usually within the current over sand or gravel.Page, Lawrence M., and Brooks M. Burr. 1991. A Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes of North America, north of Mexico. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. In one study, skipjack shad have been found to feed on other shad/herring species such as the threadfin shad, the gizzard shad and young of the year herring species. In some extreme cases, it was shown that they could rely on cannibalism to survive.McLean, R. B., J. S. Griffith, and M. V. McGee (2006) Threadfin shad, Dorosoma petenense G√ºnther, mortality: causes and ecological implications in a South-eastern United States reservoir. Journal of Fish Biology. 27(1):1-12 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1985.tb04004.x/pdf They are also known to feed on small fishes, mostly shad, while the juveniles feed on insects. The maximum size of the shad/herring utilized by skipjack shad was found to be about 30-35% of the skipjack's body length. There is not much data on the predators of the skipjack shad. Larger fish species, seabirds, and humans prey upon them. In fact, it is shown that fish species in the family Clupeidae including the skipjack shad comprise up to 45% of the diet of these avian species.Tibbs, J., and Galat, D.

Studies of common fishes of the Mississippi River at Keokuk. Bull. U. S. Bureau Fish, 45:141-225. Females produce about 100,000 to 300,000 eggs per year, presumably after 2 to 3 years of growth with an average size being Etnier, D. A. and W. C. Starnes. 1993. The Fishes of Tennessee. The University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, 681 pp. Spawning is thought to occur in the depths of main channel over coarse sand- gravel bars. Spawning temperature range is between . Eggs are broadcast over the substrate.Galat, David L., and Clark, Sandra J., 2002, Fish spawning and discharge-temperature coupling along the Missouri River: 6th Annual Missouri River Natural Resources Conference, Missouri River Science, p. 40. Skipjack shad young may reach total lengths of during their first year. The maximum length in adults is 20 inches, but they are most commonly found to be between . The oldest specimen of skipjack shad reported was four years old. High population rates and the fact that there it has little to no interest to fisheries tells us that humans do not have much influence on life history. Impoundments have changed their distribution slightly, but they have no trouble spawning as a result. Management Human impacts on skipjack shad populations seem to be minimal in the southern parts of their distribution. Dams have limited the natural distribution of the species. Skipjacks are no longer found in high numbers in the northern reaches of their distribution because of their inability to migrate over large impoundments. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) webpage tells us that \\"Further research into the species' life history and ecological requirements is needed. It is known that lock and dam structures hinder migration of skipjack shads during the early spring. If the skipjack shad is to be reestablished in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where they are nearly extirpated, fish passage features such as ladders or lifts will be required on Mississippi River lock and dams.\\"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. 2011. Species Profile: Skipjack Herring, The state of Minnesota http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rsg/profile.html?action=elementDetail&selectedElement;=AFCFA01030 In Minnesota, the construction of a fish passage facility is being considered at U.S. Lock and Dam 3 near Red Wing and could help skipjack shad migration in the Mississippi River drainage. The Minnesota DNR Division of Ecological Services received a State Wildlife Grant to conduct surveys for rare fish species in the Mississippi River from the Twin Cities to the Iowa border. These surveys were conducted from 2006 to 2008, and while the skipjack shad was a targeted species, none were found. In addition to the extirpation of the skipjack shad from Minnesota and Wisconsin, the ebony shell (Fusconaia ebena) and elephant ear (Elliptio crassidens), both state endangered mussels for which the skipjack is the sole host during their larval stages, are threatened to be extirpated as well. In order to keep their distribution from shrinking further, humans need to decrease the number of dams that are constructed, or construct dams that skipjack shads are able to migrate through. In addition to hindering their migration, dams reduce flow. Skipjacks prefer areas with fast flowing water. In addition, it is necessary to keep turbidity and siltation levels down, as this species will only live in waters that are clear to moderately turbid. Sampling of skipjack shad has been performed through the use of gillnetting and electro fishing. These methods are best utilized beneath impoundments over sand or gravel substrates around spawning time each spring, where they are most abundant. Sampling should be done across the entire native range to document its abundance in different locations and human induced changes. For now, skipjack shad have a stable abundance in the southern part of its distribution, and need more management plans put into place in the northernmost reaches of its distribution. Systematics While the skipjack shad has been attributed to the subgenus Potomolobius of the genus Alosa along with other North American shad species, it has been found to be phylogenetically the most basal of the Alosa species, which are also found in Europe and Western Asia.Bowen, BR (2008):Phylogenetic Relationships Among North American Alosa species (Clupeidae) Journal of Fish Biology 72:1188-1201 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01785.x/full References skipjack shad Category:Freshwater fish of the Southeastern United States Category:Fish of the Gulf of Mexico skipjack shad Category:Freshwater fish of North America ","title":"Skipjack shad"},{"id":"11823347","text":"Reiner Margreiter (born 26 June 1975) is an Austrian Luger who competed from 1995 to 2006.

Managed by London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, it is the only hospital in the world to specialise entirely in intestinal and colorectal medicine and is a national and international referral centre for intestinal and colorectal disorders.St. Mark's Hospital ‚àû Welcome to St Mark's Hospital It is the only hospital in the UK, and one of only 14 worldwide, to be recognised as a centre of excellence by the World Organisation of Digestive Endoscopy. Northwick Park Hospital is located at the same site. St. Mark's is closely associated with Imperial College London and is a major centre for teaching and research. Geographically it is in the northwest corner of the London Borough of Brent, adjacent with the boundary of the London Borough of Harrow. History =Beginnings= The beginnings of St Mark's Hospital were in a small room at No 11 Aldersgate Street where, in 1835, Frederick Salmon opened 'The Infirmary for the Relief of the Poor afflicted with Fistula and other Diseases of the Rectum'. There were just seven beds and in the first year 131 patients were admitted. Frederick Salmon was born in Bath in 1796 and served his apprenticeship in medicine there. He qualified at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1817 and subsequently became a house-surgeon. In 1827, he was elected to a Surgeon's post at the Aldersgate Street Dispensary. However, Salmon resigned five years later, along with the rest of the medical staff, because of a dispute with the Management Committee about the method of choosing new staff. Tired of the restrictions of working within the establishment, Salmon decided to found his own institution to provide treatment for those conditions which were regarded as 'the most distressing that can afflict our common nature'. So the 'Fistula Infirmary', as it came to be known, was started. Much of the financial support came from the City of London. The Lord Mayor, William Taylor Copeland, was a grateful patient of Salmon's and became the first President. Another benefactor was Charles Dickens, who blamed his need for Salmon's surgical attentions on 'too much sitting at my desk'! There was an overwhelming need for such an institution giving specialist treatment free of charge to London's poor. Therefore, in 1838, when the number of patients had trebled, Salmon moved to larger premises at 38 Charterhouse Square, where there were fourteen beds and more space for treating out-patients. Thirteen years later, a site in City Road was purchased from the Dyers' Company and the almshouses that occupied it were converted to a 25-bed hospital. This was opened on St Mark's Day, 25 April 1854, and took the name of St Mark's Hospital for Fistula and other Diseases of the Rectum. The staff consisted of a surgeon, a Matron, a dispenser, nurses and servants. St Mark's was unique in not employing a physician until 1948, with the arrival of Francis Avery-Jones, \\"the father of British gastroenterology\\" and pioneer of medical treatment of peptic ulcer. In 1859, Frederick Salmon resigned from his post as Surgeon. He is said to have performed 3,500 operations without a single fatality, a remarkable feat in an age when anaesthetics were only just beginning to be used and antiseptics were unknown. The Governors commissioned a portrait of him which is now displayed outside of the ward that bears his name.AIM25: St Bartholomew's Hospital: St Mark's HospitalSir Francis Avery Jones ‚Ä¢ Arthur Milton Bowler ‚Ä¢ Arthur Moreland Brown ‚Ä¢ Richard Morris Butler ‚Ä¢ Alistair Hugh Cameron ‚Ä¢ Peter Bruno D'Souza ‚Ä¢ James William Fawcett ‚Ä¢ Lionel Travers (\\"Leo\\") Martin ‚Ä¢ Elspeth Marguerita Whittaker Stokes ‚Ä¢ Verna Wright ‚Ä¢ Philip Metcalfe Yeoman ‚Äì Baron et al. 316 (7145): 1678 ‚Äì BMJ =New St Mark's= By the 1870s, ever-increasing demands on the Hospital caused rebuilding to be considered. The adjacent site, occupied by rice mills, was acquired but could not be developed for some years due to lack of funds. Eventually, building began and in January 1896 the 'New St Mark's' was opened. There was considerable difficulty in meeting the costs of maintaining the new building and it was the entertainment industry that finally came to the rescue. Lillie Langtry organised a Charity Matinee at her theatre in Drury Lane and the Hospital was saved. In 1909, the name of the Hospital was changed for a second time to St Mark's Hospital for Cancer, Fistula and Other Diseases of the Rectum, reflecting the work and interests of John Percy Lockhart- Mummery, who was a pioneer in cancer surgery. The First World War seems to have made little direct impact, although ten beds were given over to servicemen. Despite the stringency of the times, the Governors purchased more land on the east side of the Hospital which gave room for expansion after hostilities had ceased. An Appeal Fund launched in 1920 which was very successful. In 1926 work began on a large extension which gave the Hospital a new appearance and provided two new wards, as well as new Out-Patient, X-ray, Pathology and Research Departments. A nurses' home was also provided for the first time. This was replaced by a self-contained home in 1936, when the former accommodation became a private wing named after Lockhart-Mummery, who had retired the previous year. St Mark's was taken over by the new National Health Service in 1948. A Samaritan Fund was established to assist patients, and meetings ceased in May 1949 when administration of the Fund officially passed to the Ladies Association. The Ladies Association became the Friends of St Mark's in June 1971. =1972 to present= The hospital was administered jointly with Hammersmith Hospital until the NHS reforms of 1972, when it became attached to St Bartholomew's Hospital. After 1974, St Mark's was part of the newly established City and Hackney Health District, which also included Hackney General, the Mothers', the German, the Eastern and St Leonard's Hospitals. During the 1980s, many of the hospitals in the City and Hackney District were closed and their services transferred to the new Homerton Hospital. The government introduced self-governing NHS Trusts and in 1992, Sir Bernard Tomlinson's Report of the Inquiry into the London Health Service proposed radical changes to the hospital groupings then in place. St Mark's remained part of the Barts NHS Shadow Trust (later Barts NHS Group) until April 1994, when the changes envisaged by the Tomlinson Report came into force. At this point, Bart's joined with the Royal London and the London Chest Hospitals to form the Royal Hospitals NHS Trust (later Barts and The London NHS Trust). St Mark's became part of the North West London NHS trust and moved to the same site as Northwick Park Hospital. The hospital maintains strong teaching ties with Imperial College School of Medicine.

He is the author of five nonfiction books, three of which deal with history related to the American South. He is notable as an opposition researcher. Life and work Huffman is from Bolton, Mississippi. He moved the Holly Grove Plantation House from near Port Gibson, Mississippi to Bolton, Mississippi in 1990. The home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ten Point: Deer Camp in the Mississippi Delta, (1997) was his first book. It is a photo-essay, exploring decades of the Issaquena County wilderness in the Mississippi Delta. Huffman wrote text as a setting for photographs by his grandmother Florence Huffman. She had frequently accompanied her husband and friends to the hunting camp, and her photos spanned the period of 1927 to 1962. After that, developers and the US Army Corps of Engineers took over the area. This territory was the setting for William Faulkner's short story \\"The Bear\\". Mississippi in Africa: The Saga of the Slaves of Prospect Hill Plantation and Their Legacy in Liberia (2004) explores two related but different worlds of African Americans in the antebellum period. It reveals the settlement of Mississippi-in-Africa, in present-day Sinoe County, Liberia, as well as the slave world at Prospect Hill Plantation, which they left behind. This colony was initiated in the 1830s by the Mississippi chapter of the American Colonization Society, in order to relocate freed slaves out of the state. It was later incorporated into what became the independent nation of Liberia. Sultana: Surviving the Civil War, Prison, and the Worst Maritime Disaster in American History (2009) follows four young Union soldiers through the American Civil War, including their capture and imprisonment. It culminates with their surviving the explosion and sinking of the riverboat Sultana, in which 1700 people died; it was the worst maritime disaster in American history. We're with Nobody: Two Insiders Reveal the Dark Side of American Politics (2012), co-authored with Michael Rejebian, describes the authors' work for 18 years as opposition researchers.

Biography Remington was born to Pardon Sheldon and Maud Remington in Reedville, Virginia, on January 19, 1922. His family then moved to St. Louis, Missouri. He grew up collecting butterflies with his father. He did his undergraduate studies at Principia College, where he received a B.S. in 1943. During his military service in World War II, he served as a medical entomologist, throughout the Pacific, researching insect-borne diseases and centipede bites in the Philippines. After the war, Remington studied for his doctorate at Harvard. He founded the Lepidopterists' Society with Harry Clench and his first wife Jeanne Remington, mother of his three children. Remington also started a friendship with Vladimir Nabokov who was a keen amateur butterfly collector. He started teaching at Yale University in 1948. For the academic year 1958‚Äì59, Remington was a Guggenheim fellow at Oxford University. In the 1960s he proposed that there were geographic regions which he called suture zones where species tended to hybridize with close relatives. With Richard Bowers and Paul R. Ehrlich he founded Zero Population Growth. He served on the board of advisors of the Carrying Capacity Network, an organization that supports immigration reduction.

She served with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron for most of the First World War. The ship did not participate in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but did sink the German raider Leopard in 1917. Achilles became a training ship in 1918 and was sold for scrap in 1921. General description Right elevation and plan view from Brassey's Naval Annual; the shaded areas show her armouring Achilles displaced as built and fully loaded. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of .Roberts, p. 34 The engines were powered by 19 Yarrow water-tube boilers and six cylindrical boilers. The ship carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of .Parkes, p. 445 =Armament= Her main armament consisted of six BL Mark X guns in single Mk V turrets distributed in two centerline turrets (one each fore and one aft) and four turrets disposed in the corners about the funnels. Her secondary armament of four BL Mark II or Mark V guns in single Mk II turrets was carried amidships, between the wing 9.2-inch guns. Twenty-six Vickers QF 3-pounders were fitted, ten on turret roofs and eight each on the forward and aft superstructures. The last four ships of the cruisers had a secondary armament of turreted 7.5-inch guns rather than the guns in open barbettes of the first two ships; these latter four were sometimes referred to as the Warrior class.Roberts, pp. 34, 36 Because of the extra topweight of the turrets in comparison to their half- sisters their stability was reduced which made them very good seaboats and steady gun platforms because they did not roll as much. The ship also mounted three submerged torpedo tubes, one of which was mounted in the stern. =Wartime modifications= A single Hotchkiss QF 6-pounder anti-aircraft gun on a high-angle Mark Ic mounting was mounted on the quarterdeck in 1915. It had a maximum depression of 8¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 60¬∞. The gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. They had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of only . Achilless foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of a fire-control director after the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but when the director was actually fitted is not known.Parkes, p. 446 Service Achilles was ordered as part of the 1903‚Äì04 naval construction programme as the third of four armoured cruisers. She was laid down on 22 February 1904 at Elswick by Armstrong Whitworth.Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 72 The ship was launched on 17 June 1905 and completed on 22 April 1907 at the cost of ¬£1,191,103.Parkes, p. 444 Like her sister ships, she joined the 5th Cruiser Squadron in 1907, and made a port visit to Russia in 1908.Gardiner and Gray, p. 13 The ship was later transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1909.Parkes, p. 447 Achilles, accompanied by her sister , and three other armoured cruisers were sent to reinforce the defences of the Shetland Islands on 2 August 1914, days before the start of the First World War.Corbett, p. 31 She, and her squadron, was assigned to the Grand Fleet after the beginning of the war. Achilles missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 because she was refitting. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. During the Grand Fleet's sortie, Achilles spotted a U-boat.Newbolt, IV, p. 42 During another sortie by the High Seas Fleet on 18 October 1916, Achilles and three other armoured cruisers were ordered to patrol the northern end of the North Sea, between the approaches to Pentland Firth and Hardangerfjord in Norway, but they saw no German ships.Newbolt, IV, p. 50 On 16 March 1917, Achilles and the armed boarding steamer were patrolling north of the Shetland Islands when they encountered the disguised German auxiliary cruiser Leopard. The latter ship heaved to when commanded, but manoeuvred to prevent Dundee from boarding her and then fired two torpedoes which missed. Dundee retaliated by raking Leopards stern, badly damaging the German ship and then Achilles opened fire herself. The German ship sank an hour later with no survivors.Newbolt, IV, pp. 192‚Äì94 Achilles was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties,Newbolt, V, p. 135 but returned to Britain for a refit between February and December 1918.

It was designed in the late 1930s. Background While J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski was the dictator of Poland, planning concentrated on a possible attack on Poland from the east. It was only after Pi≈Çsudski's death in 1935 that the new Polish government and military re-evaluated the situation and decided that the current Polish plan for a Polish-German war, dating from the mid-1920s (Plan \\"S\\"), was inadequate and needed to be revised. However up to 1938, the priority remained in the east, not the west, and most Polish fortifications were being erected on the Polish-Soviet border. POLSKI PLAN OBRONNY ZACH√ìD Details The first version predicted that Germans would attack from Pomerania towards Warsaw, with supporting thrusts from Silesia and Prussia, aiming at establishing an early link through the Polish Corridor between German Pomerania and Prussia. After German annexation of parts of Czechoslovakia and changes of borders, Polish planners revised the plan with the expectation that a main thrust would originate from Silesia through Piotrk√≥w and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ towards Warsaw and Krak√≥w.Seidner 1978, pp. 34‚Äì40. The Polish planners correctly predicted the direction of most German thrusts, with one crucial exception: they assigned low priority to a possible deep, flanking, eastward push from Prussia and Slovakia, but that push was assigned high priority in the German plan (Fall Weiss).Seidner 1978, p. 50. A controversy involved the decision whether Polish forces should defend the lengthy borders or should withdraw east and south and try to defend a shorter line, backed with rivers. Although the second plan was more militarily sound, political considerations outweighed them, as Polish politicians were concerned that Germany could be satisfied with occupation of some disputed territories (like the Free City of Danzig, the Polish Corridor and Silesia) and then push for an early end of the war after it had occupied those territories.Seidner 1978, p. 74. The western regions were also the most densely populated ones and had major industrial centres, which were crucial for mobilization and any continued military production of equipment and supply for the Polish Army. Even with the decision to protect the borders, the fact that Poland was virtually encircled from three sides by the Germans caused the decision that some areas were almost impossible to defend and so had to be abandoned early on. That was the case for the northwestern Pomorze Voivodship and Pozna≈Ñ Voivodship. A separate force, the Land Coastal Defence, was to protect key parts of the coast as long as possible, and most of the surface Polish Navy was to be evacuated to the United Kingdom as specified in the Peking Plan (submarines were to engage the enemy in the Baltic Sea, according to the Worek Plan). The main Polish defence line was to be formed on the regions of the August√≥w Primeval Forest - Biebrza River - Narew River - Vistula River (and the towns of Modlin, Toru≈Ñ, Bydgoszcz) - Inowroc≈Çaw Lakes - Warta River - Widawka River - town of Czƒôstochowa - Silesian fortifications - town of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça - town of ≈ªywiec - village of Chab√≥wka - and the town of Nowy SƒÖcz). The second defensive line was based on the August√≥w Forest - Biebrza River - Narew River - Bug River - Vistula River - and Dunajec River. Finally, the third defensive line involved retreating southeast towards the Romanian border and holding as long as possible in the region of the Romanian bridgehead. The plan assumed the Soviet Union would be neutral, as a German- Soviet alliance seemed unlikely. The plan, however, allowed for Lithuania to try to take Wilno, a city disputed between Poland and Lithuania, and a small Polish force, primarily elite units of Border Defence Corps, was detached to secure that region. Plan \\"Zach√≥d\\" The plan assumed that Polish forces would be able to hold for several months but would be pushed back by the German numerical and technical superiority, which was estimated to be two or three to one. Then, the Western Allies (France and the United Kingdom), obliged by the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-British Common Defence Pact), would launch an offensive from the west, which would draw enough German forces away from the east to allow Polish forces to launch a counteroffensive.Seidner 1978, pp. 89‚Äì91.  Effectiveness  The plan correctly assumed the size, location and most of the directions of attack by the enemy. When Germans attacked, however, the second and further defensive lines and related items were not fully defined by the plan, and none of its aspects had been subject to a military exercise. There were also other unfinished parts, particularly those dealing with communications and supplies.Seidner 1978, p. 235‚Äì241. When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Polish forces were dealt a significant defeat at the Battle of the Border, just as critics of the plan had predicted. Further factors, such as underestimating German mobility and blitzkrieg strategy and overestimating Polish mobility, the Soviet invasion of Poland and lack of promised aid from the Western Allies, contributed to the Polish defeat by 6 October 1939.Seidner 1978, pp. 284‚Äì290.

While playing for the Rochester Hustlers, he set the International League record for the longest hitting streak with a 42-game hitting streak in . The record was broken by Brandon Watson in . Playing career =Early years= Lelivelt was born as Johannes Franciscus Lelivelt in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on 14 November 1885. His father was Franciscus Zacharias Lelivelt (later Frank) from Groessen, his mother was Theodra Mattijssen (later Dora) from Renkum. They married in Amsterdam on 19 June 1884, and emigrated to the US in 1887. Lelivelt made his major league debut with the Washington Senators in . He saw his most playing time during his years in Washington. However, his batting average would increase after he left the Senators. =Record hitting streak= Lelivelt started the 1912 season with the Rochester Hustlers. The Hustlers had won pennants each of the three previous years. After his record hitting streak, the first-place Hustlers sold Lelivelt and Tommy McMillen to the New York Highlanders. Lelivelt had a .351 batting average with 33 doubles for the Hustlers. The Toronto Maple Leafs passed the Hustlers in the standings. The city of Rochester would not have another International League champion until 1928. The record hitting streak was lost to history until the 2007 version of the International League Record Book recognized the hitting streak. Previous versions of the book would list the longest hitting streak as 36 games by Bill Sweeney in . =Later years= Lelivelt played from 1912 until 1914 as a part-time player. Despite having a .301 career major league average, he never was a full-time player. In 1914, several Naps players split time between the Cleveland Naps and the American Association Cleveland Bearcats in an effort to prevent the Federal League from moving a team to Cleveland. Lelivelt was one of those players. He would play in the minor leagues until retiring as a player in 1925. Managerial career and death Lelivelt became a player-manager for the Western League's Omaha franchise in 1920. From 1929 through 1937, he managed the Los Angeles Angels (PCL), including the 1934 team that won 137 out of 187 games (.733) and is hailed as one of the minor league's \\"greatest teams\\". When Emile Sick purchased the Seattle Rainiers, one of his first projects was bringing Lelivelt to Seattle. His Seattle Rainiers teams won Pacific Coast League titles in 1939 and 1940. Except for 1937, he managed every year until his death from a heart attack in January 1941 at the age of 55. He was interred in Glendale, California's Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery. In 1943, Lelivelt was posthumously elected to the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.

The fungus has been affiliated with the family Ajellomycetaceae (division Ascomycota) although a sexual state or teleomorph has not yet been found. History Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was first discovered by Adolfo Lutz in 1908 in Brazil. Although Lutz did not suggest a name for the disease caused by this fungus, he made note of structures he called \\"pseudococcidica\\" together with mycelium in cultures grown at 25 ¬∞C. In 1912, Alfonse Splendorehttp://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1534.html proposed the name Zymonema brasiliense and described the features of the fungus in culture. Finally in 1930, Floriano de Almeida created the genus Paracoccidioides to accommodate the species, noting its distinction from Coccidioides immitis. Physiology Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote with a rigid cell wall and organelles very similar to those of higher eukaryotes. Being a dimorphic fungus, it has the ability to grow an oval yeast-like form at 37 ¬∞C and an elongated mycelial form produced at room temperature. The mycelial and yeast phases differ in their morphology, biochemistry, and ultrastructure. The yeast form contains large amounts of Œ±-(1,3)-linked glucan. The chitin content of the mycelial form is greater than that of the yeast form, but the lipid content of both phases is comparable. The yeast reproduces by asexual budding, where daughter cells are borne asynchronously at multiple, random positions across the cell surface. Buds begin by layers of cell wall increasing in optical density at a point that eventually gives rise to the daughter cell. Once the bud has expanded, a cleavage plane develops between the nascent cell and the mother cell. Following dehiscence, the bud scar disappears. In tissue, budding occurs inside the granulomatous center of the disease lesion, as visualized by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E;) staining of histologic sections. Nonbudding cells measure 5‚Äì15 ¬µm in diameter, whereas those with multiple spherical buds measure from 10‚Äì20 ¬µm in diameter. In electron microscopy, cells with multiple buds have been found to have peripherally located nuclei and cytoplasm surrounding a large central vacuole. In the tissue form of P. brasiliensis, yeast cells are larger with thinner walls and a narrower bud base than those of the related dimorphic fungus, Blastomycosis dermatitidis. The yeast-like form of P. brasiliensis contains multiple nuclei, a porous two-layered nuclear membrane, and a thick cell wall rich in fibers, whereas the mycelial phase has thinner cell walls with a thin, electron-dense outer layer. Dimorphism The mycelial form of P. brasiliensis can be converted to the yeast form in vitro by growth on brain heart infusion agar or blood-glucose-cysteine agar when incubated for 10‚Äì20 days at 37 ¬∞C. Under these conditions, hyphal cells either die or convert to transitional forms measuring 6‚Äì30 ¬µm in diameter, which ultimately detach or remain on the hyphal cells, yielding buds. New buds develop mesosomes and become multinucleated. In contrast, yeast-like cultures can be converted to the mycelial form by reducing the incubation temperature from 37 to 25 ¬∞C. Initially, nutritional requirements of both the yeast and mycelial phases of P. brasiliensis were thought to be identical; however, later studies demonstrated the yeast form to be auxotrophic, requiring exogenous sulfur-containing amino acids including cysteine and methionine for growth. Ecology Although the habitat of P. brasiliensis remains unknown, it is commonly associated with soils in which coffee is cultivated. It has also been associated with the nine-banded armadillo, Dasypus novemcinctus. The disease caused by P. brasiliensis is mostly geographically restricted to Latin American countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela, with the greatest number of cases seen in Brazil. The endemic areas are characterized by hot, humid summers, dry temperate winters, average annual temperatures between 17 and 23 ¬∞C, and annual rainfall between 500 and 800 mm. However, the precise ecology regularities of the fungus remain elusive, and P. brasiliensis has rarely been encountered in nature outside the human host. One such rare example of environmental isolation was reported in 1971 by Maria B.de Albornoz and colleagues who isolated P. brasiliensis from samples of rural soil collected in Paracotos in the state of Miranda, Venezuela. In in vitro studies, the fungus has been shown to grow when inoculated into soil and sterile horse or cow excrement. The mycelial phase has also been shown to survive longer than the yeast phase in acidic soil. Despite a sexual state not having been documented, molecular investigations suggest the existence of recombining populations of P. brasiliensis, potentially by means of an undiscovered sexual state. Epidemiology P. brasiliensis causes a disease known as paracoccidioidomycosis characterized by slow, progressive granulomatous changes in the head mucosa, notably the nose and sinuses or the skin. Uncommonly, the disease affects the lymphatic system, the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, or the skeletal system. Due to the high proportion of cases affecting the oral mucosa, these tissues were originally thought to be the primary route of entry of fungus. However, strong evidence now indicates the respiratory tract is the chief point of entry and P. brasiliensis lung lesions occur in nearly a third of progressive cases. The disease is not contagious. Paracoccidioidomycosis is more frequently seen in adult males than females. The hormone estrogen is thought to inhibit the transformation of the mycelial to the yeast form, as supported by in vitro experimental data, and this factor may account for the relative resistance of women to infection. Detection and surveillance A number of serologic tests have been employed for the diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis. Double diffusion in agar gel and complement fixation test, are amongst the most commonly used tests in serodiagnosis. Culture extracts of the yeast or mycelia are exploited to produce effective, quick, and reproducible antigens. A study reported detection of 43 kD antigen in pooled sera of affected individuals, which might provide a basis for the development of a diagnostic test. Tests targeting the presence of serum antibodies to P. brasiliensis simultaneously detect both active and historical infections and cannot discriminate active infection. The evaluation of populations in endemic zones has shown roughly equal rates of seroconversion between men and women, suggesting equal rates of exposure, despite the strong male predominance shown by the clinical disease. Clinical manifestations P. brasiliensis causes mucous membrane ulceration of the mouth and nose with spreading through the lymphatic system. A hypothesis for entry of the fungus to the body is through periodontal membrane. The route of infection is assumed to be inhalation following which the infective propagule gives rise to the distinctive multipolar budding yeast forms in the lung resembling a \\"ship's wheel\\" seen in histological sections. Both immunologically normal and compromised people are at risk for infection. The lungs, lymph nodes, and mucous membrane of the mouth are the most frequently infected tissues. The pathological features of paracoccidioidomycosis are similar to those seen in coccidioidomycosis and blastomycosis. However, in the former, the lesions first appear in the lymphoid tissue and then extend to mucous membranes, producing localized to diffusive tissue necrosis of the lymph nodes. The typically extensive involvement of lymphoid tissue and the limited occurrence of the gastrointestinal tract, bone and prostate set the clinical picture of paracoccidioidomycosis apart from that of blastomycosis.

Diagnosis An examination by the dentist or dental hygienist should be sufficient to rule out the issues such as malnutrition and puberty. Additional corresponding diagnosis tests to certain potential disease may be required. This includes oral glucose tolerance test for diabetes mellitus, blood studies, human gonadotrophin levels for pregnancy, and X-rays for teeth and jaw bones. In order to determine the periodontal health of a patient, the dentist or dental hygienist records the sulcular depths of the gingiva and observes any bleeding on probing. This is often accomplished with the use of a periodontal probe. Alternatively, dental floss may also be used to assess the Gingival bleeding index. It is used as an initial evaluation on patient's periodontal health especially to measure gingivitis. The number of bleeding sites is used to calculate the gingival bleeding score.Gingival Bleeding Index of Carter and Barnes URL assessed on November 21, 2009 Peer-reviewed dental literature thoroughly establishes that bleeding on probing is a poor positive predictor of periodontal disease, but conversely lack of bleeding is a very strong negative predictor. The clinical interpretation of this research is that while BOP presence may not indicate periodontal disease, continued absence of BOP is a strong predictor (approximately 98%) of continued periodontal health.Absence of bleeding on probing.

Background  The Conservative Party in Scotland was traditionally a unionist party. In the late 1960s, support in Scotland for the pro-independence Scottish National Party was growing (seen spectacularly in Winnie Ewing's victory at the Hamilton by-election of 1967). In response the then Labour government set up the Kilbrandon Commission (1969‚Äì1973) to draw up its plans for devolution. Prior to Labour's initiative, at the Conservative Party Conference of 1968, held in Perth in Scotland, Edward Heath announced a party policy of support for devolution. Heath then formed a constitutional committee chaired by former Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In 1970, this committee produced \\"Scotland‚Äôs Government\\", a report that recommended the creation of a Scottish Assembly with 125 elected members and powers to initiate and discuss bills. However, the Bills were to require approval of the United Kingdom Parliament.  Aftermath  The 1970 General Election was won by the Conservative Party, and Heath became Prime Minister. However, the electoral weakness of the Nationalists removed the political pressure for devolution, which caused it to slip from the agenda. The two general elections of 1974 saw the return of a minority Labour Government and advances by the Nationalists (they won 7 seats in the February election and 11 in the October election). Labour was thus dependent on Nationalist support in Parliament, and hence, despite some opposition from within its own party, passed the Scotland Act 1978. This act provided for devolution, subject to approval by a referendum which took place in 1979. In 1975, Edward Heath was replaced as Conservative leader by Margaret Thatcher. Under her leadership, the Conservatives gradually returned to a policy of opposing Scottish devolution. However, former leader Alec Douglas-Home was still able to urge Scots to vote 'no' to Labour's proposal in 1979, with the promise that a Conservative government would offer a \\"better\\" bill. When the referendum of 1979 failed to deliver the required mandate for devolution, the Nationalists withdrew their support for the Labour Government, resulting in a general election in 1979, which was won by the Conservatives. Despite being the only major party now opposing constitutional change and despite their reduced popularity and strength in Scotland, Conservative electoral victories in 1983, 1987 and 1992 ensured that no further legislative progress was made until the election of Labour under Tony Blair in 1997 led to a second devolution referendum. Again the Conservatives opposed devolution in the 1997 debate (although Heath personally supported Labour's proposals), but this time their opposition was unsuccessful, and the Scottish Parliament was created by the Scotland Act 1998. Subsequent to its creation, the Conservative Party has indicated its acceptance of Scottish devolution as an irreversible political fact.

Esther was the chief character in the Book of Esther. She is counted among the prophetesses of Israel. Allusions in rabbinic literature to the Biblical story of Esther contain various expansions, elaborations and inferences beyond the text presented in the book of the Bible. Rabbinic account The following is briefly the story of Esther's life as elaborated by the various midrashim: =Family= A foundling or an orphan, her father dying before her birth, her mother at her birth, Esther was reared in the house of Mordecai, her first cousin, to whom, according to some accounts, she was even married. Maharal of Prague says that the circumstances of her birth were not coincidental. Alienation and loneliness are tools like any others and are given in order to enable one to become who they can be. The Maharal points out that she had an inner strength.Heller, Tziporah. \\"Esther's Hidden Strength\\", aish.com According to some sources, Esther was a descendant of Saul. This has special significance since Haman is descended from Agag, whom Saul temporarily spared from death against God's wishes. =Her name= Her original name was \\"Hadassah\\" (myrtle), that of \\"Esther\\" being given her by the star-worshipers, as reflecting her sweet character and the comeliness of her person. =Esther and Ahasuerus= In the Bible, King Ahasuersus of Persia banished Queen Vashti for having defied him. He then decreed that all beautiful young women be gathered to the palace from every province of his kingdom, that he might find a new wife and queen. When the edict of the king was promulgated, and his eunuchs scoured the country in search of a new wife for the monarch, Esther hid herself so as not to be seen of men, and remained in seclusion for four years, until even God's voice urged her to repair to the king's palace, where her absence had been noticed. Her appearance among the candidates for the queen's vacant place causes a commotion, all feeling that with her charms none can compete; her rivals even make haste to adorn her. She spurned the usual resources for enhancing her beauty, so that the keeper of the harem becomes alarmed lest he be accused of neglect. He therefore showers attentions upon her, and places at her disposal riches never given to others. But she will not be tempted to use the king's goods, nor will she eat of the king's food, being a faithful Jewess; she continues her modest mode of living. When her turn comes to be ushered into the royal presence, Median and Persian women flank her on both sides, but her beauty is such that the decision in her favor is at once assured. To the Rabbis, Esther was one of the most beautiful women ever created.Megillah 15a Another source says Esther was yerakroket, often translated as \\"greenish\\";Megillah 13a but as classical Greek used the word chloros (\\"green\\") to refer to honey-like yellow and to human skin as well as what we call green,The sea was never blue the rabbis who lived in a Greek- influenced context may have intended that Esther's skin was a normal shade of yellow. According to the Talmud, she had seven maids, which in order to remember when it was Shabbat, she named after the days of the week. Rather than use the dehumanizing \\"Monday\\", \\"Tuesday\\", etc., she named them after the order of creation. One was \\"Light\\", another \\"Transcendence\\", etc. They all ultimately converted to Judaism.Babylonian Talmud: Megillah 10b-14a The king has been in the habit of comparing the charms of the applicants with a picture of Vashti suspended over his couch, and up to the time when Esther approaches him none has eclipsed the beauty of his beheaded spouse. But at the sight of Esther he at once removes the picture. Esther, true to Mordecai's injunction, conceals her birth from her royal consort. Mordecai was prompted to give her this command by the desire not to win favors as Esther's cousin. The king, of course, is very desirous of learning all about her antecedents, but Esther, after vouchsafing him the information that she, too, is of princely blood, turns the conversation, by a few happy counter-questions regarding Vashti. =Mordecai and Esther= Mordecai's daily visits to the courtyard are for the purpose of ascertaining whether Esther has remained true to the precepts of her religion. She had not eaten forbidden food, preferring a diet of vegetables, and had otherwise scrupulously observed the Law. When the crisis came Mordecai‚Äîwho had, by his refusal to bow to Haman or, rather, to the image of an idol ostentatiously displayed on his breast,Pir·∏≥e R. El. lxix. brought calamity upon the Jews‚Äîappeared in his mourning garments, and Esther, frightened, gave birth to a still-born child. To avoid gossip she sent Hatach instead of going herself to ascertain the cause of the trouble. This Hatach was afterward met by Haman and slain. Still Mordecai had been able to tell Hatach his dream, that Esther would be the little rill of water separating the two fighting monsters, and that the rill would grow to be a large stream flooding the earth. The rabbis struggled with the idea of why God would allow Haman to threaten the Jews with destruction. R. Shimon b. Yohai said that it was because, unlike Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they had bowed down to Nebuchadnezzar's idol. However, he explained that since they did not mean to show devotion, but acted only for appearances sake, so God decreed only the apparent destruction of the Jews, but would not permit Haman to carry it out.Midrash Le·∏≥a·∏• ·π¨ob (Buber, \\"Sifre di-Agadta,\\" Wilna, 1880) A second reason draws a distinction between Daniel, who abstained from Nebuchadnezzar's table and the Jews (with the exception of Mordecai), who attended Ahasuerus' banquet in Chapter 1. =Esther before Ahasuerus= Mordecai called upon her to pray for her people and then intercede with the king. Though Pesa·∏• was near, and the provision of Megillat Ta'anit forbidding fasting during this time could not be observed without disregarding Mordecai's plea, she overcame her cousin's scruples by a very apt counter-question, and at her request all the Jews \\"that had on that day already partaken of food\\" observed a rigid fast, in spite of the feast-day, while Mordecai prayed and summoned the children and obliged even them to abstain from food. On the third day, with serene mien she passed on to the inner court, arraying herself in her best, and taking her two maids, upon one of whom, according to court etiquette, she leaned, while the other carried her train. Ahasuerus attempted to ignore her, and turned his face away, but an angel forced him to look at her. She, however, fainted at the sight of his flushed face and burning eyes, and leaned her head on her handmaid, expecting to hear her doom pronounced; but God increased her beauty to such an extent that Ahasuerus could not resist. Why Haman was invited the Rabbis explain in various ways. She desired to make the king jealous by playing the lover to Haman, which she did at the feast, planning to have him killed even though she should share his fate. At the supreme moment, when she denounced Haman, it was an angel that threw Haman on the couch, though he intended to kneel before the queen; so that the king, suspecting an attempt upon the virtue and life of his queen, forthwith ordered him to be hanged. = Esther's status = She remained eternally young; when she married Ahasuerus she was at least forty years of age, or even, according to some, eighty years based on the numerical value of Hadassah, her Hebrew name. She is also counted among the prophetesses of Israel.  The sources  The story of Esther‚Äîtypical in many regards of the perennial fate of the Jews, and recalled even more vividly by their daily experience than by the annual reading of the Megillah at Purim‚Äîinvited, both by the brevity of some parts of the narrative and by the associations of its events with the bitter lot of Israel, amplifications readily supplied by popular fancy and the artificial interpretation of Biblical verse.\\"Esther\\", Jewish encyclopedia The rabbis saw the story off Esther as yet another retelling of the abiding conflict between Israel and Amalek, and in that way found it canonical.Koller, Aaron.

The wars were dominated by land campaigns in Hungary, including Transylvania (today in Romania) and Vojvodina (today in Serbia), Croatia and central Serbia. By the 16th century, the Ottomans had become a serious threat to the European powers, with Ottoman ships sweeping away Venetian possessions in the Aegean and Ionian seas and Ottoman-supported Barbary pirates seizing Spanish possessions in the Maghreb. The Protestant Reformation, the French‚ÄìHabsburg rivalry and the numerous civil conflicts of the Holy Roman Empire distracted the Christians from their conflict with the Ottomans. Meanwhile, the Ottomans had to contend with the Persian Safavid Empire and to a lesser extent the Mamluk Sultanate, which was defeated and fully incorporated into the empire. Initially, Ottoman conquests in Europe made significant gains with a decisive victory at Moh√°cs reducing around one third (central) part of Kingdom of Hungary to the status of an Ottoman tributary.See Cross and Crescent Later, the Peace of Westphalia and the Spanish War of Succession in the 17th and 18th centuries respectively left the Austrian Empire as the sole firm possession of the House of Habsburg. After the Siege of Vienna in 1683, the Habsburgs assembled a large coalition of European powers known as the Holy League, allowing them to fight the Ottomans and to regain control over Hungary. The Great Turkish War ended with the decisive Holy League victory at Zenta. The wars ended after Austria's participation in the war of 1787-1791, which Austria fought allied with Russia. Intermittent tension between Austria and the Ottoman Empire continued throughout the nineteenth century, but they never fought each other in a war and ultimately found themselves allied in World War I, in the aftermath of which both empires were dissolved. Historians have focused on the second siege of Vienna of 1683, depicting it as a decisive Austrian victory that saved Western civilization and marked the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Recent historians have taken a broader perspective, noting that the Habsburgs at the same time resisted internal separatist movements and were fighting Prussia and France for control of central Europe. The key advance made by the Europeans was an effective combined arms doctrine involving the cooperation of infantry, artillery and cavalry. Nevertheless, the Ottomans were able to maintain military parity with the Habsburgs until the middle of the eighteenth century. * Historian Gunther E. Rothenberg has emphasized the non-combat dimension of the conflict, whereby the Habsburgs built up military communities that protected their borders and produced a steady flow of well-trained, motivated soldiers.For the historiography see Charles Messenger, ed., Reader's Guide to Military History (2001) 24‚Äì26 June. Origins Battle of Nicopolis (1396) While the Habsburgs were occasionally the Kings of Hungary and Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire (and almost always that of the Holy Roman Empire after the 15th century), the wars between the Hungarians and the Ottomans included other Dynasties as well. Naturally, the Ottoman Wars in Europe attracted support from the West, where the advancing and powerful Islamic state was seen as a threat to Christendom in Europe. The Crusades of Nicopolis (1396) and of Varna (1443‚Äì44) marked the most determined attempts by Europe to halt the Turkic advance into Central Europe and the Balkans.Colin Imber, The Crusade of Varna, 1443‚Äì45 (2013). For a while the Ottomans were too busy trying to put down Balkan rebels such as Vlad Dracula. However, the defeat of these and other rebellious vassal states opened up Central Europe to Ottoman invasion. The Kingdom of Hungary now bordered the Ottoman Empire and its vassals. After King Louis II of Hungary was killed at the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, his widow Queen Mary of Austria fled to her brother the Archduke of Austria, Ferdinand I. Ferdinand's claim to the throne of Hungary was further strengthened by his marriage to Anne, the sister of King Louis II and the only family member claimant to the throne of the shattered Kingdom. Consequently, Ferdinand I was elected King of Bohemia, and at the Diet of Pozsony he and his wife were elected King and Queen of Hungary. This clashed with the Turkish objective of placing the puppet John Szapolyai on the throne, thus setting the stage for a conflict between the two powers.B√©la K. Kir√°ly, and Gunther Erich Rothenberg, War and Society in East Central Europe: The fall of medieval kingdom of Hungary: Mohacs 1526-Buda 1541 (1989). Habsburg advance \\"The Great Gun\\" (1518), an allegorical representation by Albrecht D√ºrer of the Turkish menace for the German lands The Austrian lands were in miserable economic and financial conditions, thus Ferdinand desperately introduced the so-called Turkish Tax (T√ºrken Steuer). Despite this, he was not able to collect enough money to pay the expenses of the defense costs of the Austrian lands. His annual revenues only allowed him to hire 5.000 mercenaries for two months, thus Ferdinand asked help from his brother Emperor Charles V, and started to borrowing money from rich bankers like the Fugger family. Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in 1530, by Titian. Ferdinand I attacked Hungary, a state severely weakened by civil conflict, in 1527, in an attempt to drive out John Szapolyai and enforce his authority there. John was unable to prevent Ferdinand's campaigning, which led to the capture of Buda and several other key settlements along the Danube. Despite this, the Ottoman sultan was slow to react and only came to the aid of his vassal when he launched an army of about 120,000 men on 10 May 1529.S. Turnbull, The Ottoman Empire 1326‚Äì1699, 50 The Austrian branch of Habsburg monarchs needed the economic power of Hungary for the Ottoman wars. During the Ottoman wars the territory of former Kingdom of Hungary shrunk by around 70%; despite these territorial and demographic losses, the smaller, heavily war-torn Royal Hungary remained economically more important than Austria or Kingdom of Bohemia at the end of the 16th century, as it was Ferdinand's largest source of revenue.Dr. Istv√°n Kenyeres: The Financial Administrative Reforms and Revenues of Ferdinand I in Hungary, English summary at page 92 Link1: Link2: Technological advantage of the Western Christian forces The earliest type of Turkish hand cannons are called as \\"≈ûakaloz\\", which word came from the Hungarian hand cannon \\"Szak√°llas puska\\" in the 15th century. Although Ottoman janissaries adopted firearms in battles since the beginning of the 16th century, the Ottoman usage of the handheld firearms spread much more slowly than in the Western Christian armies. Wheel-lock firearms were unfamiliar for Ottoman soldiers until the Siege of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in 1543, despite it was used for decades by Western Christian armies in Kingdom of Hungary and in Western Europe. According to a report from 1594, the Ottoman soldiers hadn't adopted the pistol yet. In 1602 the grand vizier reported from Hungarian front about the firepower superiority of the Christian forces: > \\"in a field or during a siege we are in distressed position, because the > greater part of the enemy forces are infantry armed with muskets, while the > majority of our forces are horsemen, and we have very few specialists > skilled in the musket\\" According to Alvise Foscarini's (Venetian ambassador in Istambul) report in 1637, > \\"few Janissaries even knew how to use an arquebus\\" Siege of Vienna The Ottomans were unable to overcome the long pike formations and arquebus fire of the defenders in the Siege of Vienna, 1529 Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent easily wrested from Ferdinand most of the gains he had achieved in the previous two years ‚Äì to the disappointment of Ferdinand I, only the fortress of Bratislava resisted. Considering the size of Suleiman's army and the devastation wrought upon Hungary in the previous few years it is not surprising that the will to resist one of the world's most powerful states was lacking in many of the recently garrisoned Habsburg settlements.James Reston, Defenders of the faith: Charles V, Suleyman the Magnificent, and the battle for Europe, 1520‚Äì1536 (2009). The Sultan arrived at Vienna on 27 September 1529. Ferdinand's army was some 16,000 strong ‚Äì he was outnumbered roughly 7 to 1 and the walls of Vienna were an invitation to Ottoman cannon (6 ft thick along some parts). However, the heavy cannons on which the Ottomans relied to breach the walls were all abandoned on the way to Vienna, after they got stuck in mud due to heavy rainfall.Spencer Tucker, Battles That Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict, p. 169Henry Elliot Maiden, Salus Vienna Tua: The great siege of 1683, Chapter 2 \\"and the absence of his heavy artillery, stuck deep in the soil of Hungarian roads, saved the capital of Austrian dominions...\\" Ferdinand defended Vienna with great vigour. By 12 October, after much mining and counter-mining an Ottoman war council was called and on 14 October the Ottomans abandoned the siege. The retreat of the Ottoman army was hampered by the resistance of Bratislava, which once more bombarded the Ottomans. Early snowfall made matters worse, and it would be another three years before Suleiman could campaign in Hungary. Little War The Ottoman army consisted of both heavy and missile fire, cavalry and infantry, making it both versatile and powerful. After the defeat at Vienna, the Ottoman Sultan had to turn his attention to other parts of his domain. Taking advantage of this absence, Archduke Ferdinand launched an offensive in 1530, recapturing Esztergom and other forts. An assault on Buda was only thwarted by the presence of Ottoman Turkish soldiers. As in the previous Austrian offensive, the return of the Ottomans forced the Habsburgs in Austria to go on the defensive. In 1532 Suleiman sent a massive Ottoman army to take Vienna. However, the army took a different route to K≈ëszeg. After a defence by a mere 700-strong force led by the Croatian earl Nikola Juri≈°iƒá, the defenders accepted an \\"honorable\\" surrender of the fortress in return for their safety. The Sultan then withdrew, content with his success and recognizing the limited Austrian gains in Hungary, while forcing Ferdinand to recognize John Szapolyai as King of Hungary. Whilst the peace between the Austrians and the Ottomans would last for nine years, John Szapolyai and Ferdinand found it convenient to continue skirmishes along their respective borders. In 1537 Ferdinand broke the peace treaty by sending his ablest generals to a disastrous siege of Osijek, which was another Ottoman triumph. Nevertheless, Ferdinand was recognized by the Treaty of Nagyv√°rad as the heir of the Kingdom of Hungary. After the death of John Szapolyai in 1540, Ferdinand's inheritance was robbed, given instead to John's son, John II Sigismund. Attempting to enforce the treaty, the Austrians advanced on Buda where they experienced another defeat by Suleiman; the elderly Austrian General Rogendorf proved to be incompetent. Suleiman then finished off the remaining Austrian troops and proceeded to de facto annex Hungary. By the time a peace treaty was enforced in 1551, Habsburg Hungary had been reduced to little more than border land. In 1552 the forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Kara Ahmed Pasha laid siege on the Castle of Eger, located in the northern part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but the defenders led by Istv√°n Dob√≥ repelled the attacks and defended the castle of Eger. The Siege of Eger (1552) become an emblem of national defense and patriotic heroism in Hungary's Occupations After the seizure of Buda by the Turks in 1541, west and north Hungary recognized a Habsburg as king (\\"Royal Hungary\\"), while the central and southern counties were occupied by the Sultan (\\"Ottoman Hungary\\"), and the east became the Principality of Transylvania. The vast majority of the seventeen and nineteen thousands Ottoman soldiers in service in the Ottoman fortresses in the territory of Hungary were Orthodox and Muslim Balkan Slavs instead of ethnic Turkish people.Laszlo Kontler, \\"A History of Hungary\\" p. 145 Southern Slavs were also acting as akinjis and other light troops intended for pillaging in the territory of present-day Hungary.Inalcik Halil: \\"The Ottoman Empire\\" Turkish attack on river fortress, Siege of Szigetv√°r, 1566) There were wasted opportunities on both sides in the Little War; Austrian attempts to increase their influence in Hungary were just as unsuccessful as the Ottoman drives to Vienna. Nonetheless, there were no illusions as to the status quo: the Ottoman Empire was still a very powerful and dangerous threat. Even so, the Austrians would go on the offensive again, their generals building a bloody reputation for so much loss of life. Costly battles like those fought at Buda and Osijek were avoided but not absent in the upcoming conflicts. In any case Habsburg interests were split between fighting for devastated European land under Islamic control, trying to stop the gradual decentralization of Imperial authority in Germany, and for Spain's ambitions in North Africa, the Low Countries and against the French. Nevertheless, the Ottomans, whilst hanging on to their supreme power, could not expand as they had in the days of Mehmet and Bayezid. To the east lay further wars against their Shi'ite opponents, the Safavids. Both the French (since 1536) and the Dutch (since 1612) occasionally worked together against the Habsburgs with the Ottomans. Suleiman the Magnificent led one final campaign in 1566, ending at the Siege of Szigetv√°r. The Siege was meant to be only a temporary stop before taking on Vienna. However, the fortress withstood against the Sultan's armies. Eventually the Sultan, already an old man at 72 years (ironically campaigning to restore his health), died. The Royal Physician was strangledKinross, John Patrick, Ottoman Centuries, (Morrow Publishing, 1977), 254. to prevent news from reaching the troops and the unaware Ottomans took the fort, ending the campaign shortly afterward without making a move against Vienna.James Tracy, \\"The Road to Szigetv√°r: Ferdinand I's Defense of His Hungarian Border, 1548‚Äì1566.\\" Austrian History Yearbook 44 (2013): 17‚Äì36. War in the Mediterranean =1480‚Äì1540= Siege of Rhodes in 1522 Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire rapidly began displacing her Christian opponents at sea. In the 14th century, the Ottomans had only a small navy. By the 15th century, hundreds of ships were in the Ottoman arsenal taking on Constantinople and challenging the naval powers of the Italian Republics of Venice and Genoa. In 1480, the Ottomans unsuccessfully laid siege to Rhodes Island, the stronghold of the Knights of St. John. When the Ottomans returned in 1522, they were more successful and the Christian powers lost a crucial naval base. In retaliation, Charles V led a massive Holy League of 60,000 soldiers against the Ottoman city of Tunis. After Hayreddin Barbarossa's fleet was defeated by a Genoan one, Charles' army put 30,000 of the city's residents to the sword.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East, Vol. II, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 506. Afterwards, the Spanish placed a friendlier Muslim leader in power. The campaign was not an unmitigated success; many Holy League soldiers succumbed to dysentery, only natural for such a large overseas army. Furthermore, much of Barbarossa's fleet was not present in North Africa and the Ottomans won a victory against the Holy League in 1538 at the Battle of Preveza.Siege of Malta, 1565 =Siege of Malta= Despite the loss of Rhodes, Cyprus, an island farther from Europe than Rhodes, remained Venetian. When the Knights of St. John moved to Malta, the Ottomans found that their victory at Rhodes only displaced the problem; Ottoman ships came under frequent attacks by the Knights, as they attempted to stop Ottoman expansion to the West. Not to be outdone, Ottoman ships struck many parts of southern Europe and around Italy, as part of their wider war with France against the Habsburgs (See Italian Wars). The situation finally came to a head when Suleiman, the victor at Rhodes in 1522 and at Djerba, decided in 1565 to destroy the Knights' base at Malta. The presence of the Ottoman fleet so close to the Papacy alarmed the Spanish, who began assembling first a small expeditionary force (that arrived in time for the siege) and then a larger fleet to relieve the Island. The ultra-modern star-shaped fort of St Elmo was taken only with heavy casualties including the Ottoman general Turgut Reis, and the rest of the island was too much. Even so, Barbary piracy continued and the victory at Malta had no effect on Ottoman military strength in the Mediterranean. =Cyprus and Lepanto= Battle of Lepanto The death of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1566 brought Selim II to power. Known by some as \\"Selim the Sot\\", he assembled a massive expedition to take Cyprus from Venice. An option that Selim opted out of was to assist the Moorish rebellion that had been instigated by the Spanish crown to root out disloyal Moors. Had Selim succeeded in landing in the Iberian peninsula, he may have been cut off, for after he had captured Cyprus in 1571 he suffered a decisive naval defeat at Lepanto. The Holy League, assembled by the Pope to defend the Island, arrived too late to save it (despite 11 months of resistance at Famagusta); having collected so much of Europe's available military strength, the Holy League was better supplied with ammunition and armor and inflicted a blow on the Ottomans. The chance to retake Cyprus was wasted in the typical squabbling that followed the victory, so that when the Venetians signed a peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1573, they did so according to Ottoman terms. War in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia By the end of Suleiman's reign, the Empire spanned approximately , extending over three continents: mainly Europe, Africa and Asia. In addition, the Empire became a dominant naval force, controlling much of the Mediterranean Sea. By this time, the Ottoman Empire was a major part of the European political sphere. The Ottomans became involved in multi-continental religious wars when Spain and Portugal were united under the Iberian Union lead by the Habsburg monarch King Philip the Second, the Ottomans as holders of the Caliph title, meaning leader of all Muslims worldwide, and Iberians, as leaders of the Christian crusaders, were locked in a worldwide conflict, with zones of operations in the Mediterranean seaCrowley, Roger Empires of the Sea: The siege of Malta, the battle of Lepanto and the contest for the center of the world, Random House, 2008 and Indian OceanHistory cooperative where Iberians circumnavigated Africa to reach India, and in the way, wage wars upon the Ottomans and its local Muslim allies and likewise the Iberians passed through newly Christianised Latin- America and had sent expeditions that traversed the Pacific in order to Christianize the partially Muslim Philippines and use it as a base to further attack the Muslims in the far east.Charles A. Truxillo (2012), Jain Publishing Company, \\"Crusaders in the Far East: The Moro Wars in the Philippines in the Context of the Ibero-Islamic World War\\". In which case, the Ottomans sent armies to aid its easternmost vassal and territory, the Sultanate of Aceh in Southeast Asia.Palabiyik, Hamit, Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age, (Ankara, 2008), 84. During the 17th century, the bloody worldwide conflict between the Ottoman Caliphate and Iberian Union was nevertheless a stalemate since both powers were at similar population, technology and economic levels. Ruins of K≈ëszeg castle, site of the Siege of G√ºns in 1532 Thirteen Years' War 1593‚Äì1606 Mismanagement by Murad III may have led to early Ottoman defeats in the war After the death of Suleiman in 1566, Selim II posed less of a threat to Europe. Though Cyprus was captured at long last, the Ottomans failed against the Habsburgs at sea (see above, Battle of Lepanto). Selim died not too long after, leaving in power his son Murad III, a hedonist who spent more time at his Harem than at the war front. Under such deteriorating circumstances, the Empire found itself at war with the Austrians yet again. In the early stages of the war, the military situation for the Ottomans worsened as the Principalities of Wallachia, Moldova and Transylvania each had new rulers who renounced their vassalship to the Ottomans. At the Battle of Sisak, a group of ghazis sent to raid the insubordinate lands in Croatia were thoroughly defeated by tough Imperial troops fresh from savage fighting in the Low Countries. In response to this defeat, the Grand Vizier launched a large army of 13,000 Janissaries plus numerous European levies against the Christians. When the Janissaries rebelled against the Vizier's demands for a winter campaign, the Ottomans had captured little other than Veszpr√©m. Technological disadvantages also significantly worsened the Ottoman positions in Hungary. The fatal Cavalry charge by Hasan Predojeviƒá, during the Battle of Sisak in 1593. In 1594 an even larger army was assembled by the Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha. In the face of this threat, the Austrians abandoned a siege of Gran, a fortress that had fallen during Suleiman's career, and then lost Raab. For the Austrians, their only comfort in the year came when the fortress of Kom√°rno held out long enough against the Vizier's forces to retreat for the winter. Despite the success of the previous year, the situation for the Ottomans worsened yet again in 1595. A Christian coalition of the former vassal states along with Austrian troops recaptured Esztergom and marched southward down the Danube. Michael the Brave, the prince of Wallachia started a campaign against the Turks (1594‚Äì1595), conquering several castles near the Lower Danube, including Giurgiu, BrƒÉila, H√¢r≈üova, and Silistra, while his Moldavian allies defeated the Turks in Ia≈üi and other parts of Moldavia.Constantin C. Giurescu, Istoria Rom√¢nilor. Bucharest: Editura All, 2007 (Romanian), p. 183. Michael continued his attacks deep within the Ottoman Empire, taking the forts of Nicopolis, Ribnic, and ChiliaColn, Emporungen so sich in Konigereich Ungarn, auch in Siebenburgen Moldau, in der der bergischen Walachay und anderen Oerten zugetragen haben, 1596 and even reaching as far as Adrianople (Edirne),Marco Venier, correspondence with the Doge of Venice, 16 July 1595 the former Ottoman capital city; no Christian army had set foot in the region since the days of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologoi. Victory of the Ottoman Army during the Battle of Keresztes. Following the defeat of the Ottoman army in Wallachia (see the Battle of CƒÉlugƒÉreni) and the series of unsuccessful confrontations with the Habsburgs (culminating in the devastating siege and fall of Ottoman- held Esztergom), and alarmed by the success and proximity of the threat, the new Sultan Mehmed III strangled his 19 brothers to seize power and personally marched his army to the north west of Hungary to counter his enemies' moves. In 1596 Eger fell to the Ottomans. At the decisive Battle of Keresztes, a slow Austrian response was wiped out by the Ottomans. Mehmet III's inexperience in ruling showed when he failed to reward the Janissaries for their efforts in battle; rather he punished them for not fighting well enough and thereby incited a rebellion. The Austrians renewed the war against their enemies in the summer of 1597 with a drive southward, taking P√°pa, Tata, Raab (Gy≈ër) and Veszpr√©m. Further Habsburg victories were achieved when a Turkish relief force was defeated at Grosswardein (Nagyv√°rad). Enraged by these defeats, the Turks replied with a more energetic response so that by 1605, after much wasted Austrian relief efforts and failed sieges on both sides, only Raab remained in the hands of the Austrians. In that year a pro-Turkish vassal prince was elected leader of Transylvania by the Hungarian nobles and the war came to a conclusion with the Peace of Zsitva-Torok. Conquest of Crete After Ottoman victories at Rhodes (1522), Chios (1566) and Cyprus (1570); Crete (1669) was the last major island in the eastern Mediterranean to be brought under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Before Ottoman capture, Crete was one of the largest and most prominent overseas holdings of the Republic of Venice. The island was significant to the Ottomans not only for its strategic position along shipping routes between Istanbul and Egypt, but also for its role as a safe harbor for pirates. A Venetian Fortress in Candia (Heraklion), Crete In July 1644, an Ottoman ship bound for Egypt, carrying the former Chief Black Eunuch of the Harem, the kadi of Cairo, and many pilgrims heading to Mecca, was besieged and captured by the Knights of Malta. In response, the Ottomans in 1645 amassed a sizable fleet with no stated target, although many believed it would sail on Malta. Taking advantage of surprise, the Ottomans began their campaign on Crete in June 1645.Setton (1991), p. 126 Between 1645 and 1648, the Ottomans captured nearly the entire island, and in May 1648 began a siege on the capital, Candia (modern Heraklion). Even though the Ottomans held nearly universal control over the island, the Siege of Candia would go on for 21 years. The situation was complicated by naval engagements against Christian fleets in the Aegean, as well as internal political turmoil including the deposition of Sultan Ibrahim in favor of his son, Mehmed IV.Setton (1991), p. 150-153 During this same period, the Ottoman-Venetian war raged on several other fronts, notably a campaign in Dalmatia and several Venetian attempts to blockade the Dardanelles.Imber (2002), p. 84 In 1666, after the resolution of several other fronts, the Ottomans dispatched sizeable reinforcements towards Crete, under the personal command of Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed Pasha.Setton (1991), p. 193 Over the final two years of the siege, the Venetians, bolstered by Ottoman infighting and expecting reinforcements from France, refused several offers of peace treaties.Setton (1991), p. 216 After a failed attempt by French soldiers under the Duke of Beaufort to break the Ottoman siege, the city surrendered on 5 September 1669.Finkel (2006), p. 271 With this victory, the Ottomans secured their first major territorial gain in almost a century, and simultaneously ended 500 years of Venetian rule over Crete. Great Turkish War The Ottoman Empire in 1683 In 1663, the Ottomans launched a disastrous invasion of the Habsburg Monarchy, ending at the Battle of St. Gotthard. The battle was won by the Christians, chiefly through the attack of 6,000 French troops led by La Feuillade and Coligny.Count Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi, the Poet-Warlord The Austrians were unable to follow up on this victory due to the intervention of French forces in the Rhine; in such circumstances the Protestant allies of the Catholic Habsburgs would have proven unreliable, wanting instead to have the Austrians and themselves fight the French in a German coalition. The Ottomans therefore turned their attention north again against the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. By now, the Kingdom had fallen into a terrible state; the Sejm had divided loyalties and the treasury was bankrupt. It is therefore noteworthy that John III Sobieski, king of Poland, led a decisive victory against the Ottomans at the Second battle of Khotyn. Restless, the Ottomans were to have another chance in 1682, when the Grand Vizier marched a massive army into Hungary and to Vienna in response to Habsburg raids into Ottoman controlled Hungary. =Siege of Vienna= In 1683, after 15 months of mobilizing forces, the Grand Vizier reached Vienna to find the city well defended and prepared. Worst for the Vizier were the numerous alliances established by the Austrians, including with Sobieski. When the siege of Vienna began in 1683, Sobieski and his coalition of Germans and Poles arrived just as Vienna's defense was becoming untenable. In a decisive battle, the Ottomans were defeated and the siege lifted. The climax of the Siege of Vienna =Reconquest of the Ottoman occupied territories of Kingdom of Hungary= Battle of Zenta In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed European campaign was started to enter Buda, the erstwhile capital of medieval Hungary. This time, the Holy League's army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers, the Christian forces reconquered Buda. (See: Siege of Buda) In 1687, the Ottomans raised new armies and marched north once more. However, Duke Charles intercepted the Turks at the Second Battle of Moh√°cs and avenged the loss inflicted on the last Hungarian King over 160 years ago by Suleiman the Magnificent. The Ottomans continued to resist the southward-pressing Austrians, denying them an opportunity to negotiate from a position of strength. Only when the Ottomans suffered yet another disastrous battle at the crossing at Zenta in 1697 did the Ottomans sue for peace; the resulting treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 secured territories, the rest of Hungary and overlordship of Transylvania for the Austrians. Throughout Europe Protestants and Catholics hailed Prince Eugene of Savoy as \\"the savior of Christendom\\" ‚Äì English volunteers, including a son of Prince Rupert (nephew of Charles I of England) and Protestants from as far as Scotland fought in the Prince's army. For the Ottomans, the years between 1683 and 1702 were a sad time; 12 Grand Viziers were deposed in 19 years ‚Äì the legacy of what was at one time under K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha the most powerful position of one of the most powerful Empires in the world. Endgame =18th century wars= The Austro-Turkish War (1716‚Äì18) Prince Eugene of Savoy captures Belgrade, 1717 Although the Great Turkish War was a disaster for the Ottomans, the Habsburgs were soon drawn into another destructive European war (the War of the Spanish Succession) against the French, their traditional rivals. Brimming with confidence after their victories over the Russians in 1711 (Pruth River Campaign) and over the Venetians in 1715 (Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1714‚Äì1718)), the Ottomans declared war on the Habsburg Monarchy in 1716 and marched north from Belgrade in July under the command of Grand Vizier Ali Pasha. The invasion was a catastrophe, however, and the Ottoman army was utterly destroyed and the Grand Vizier slain at the battle of Petrovaradin in August by an outnumbered Austrian army under the command of Prince Eugene of Savoy, who went on to capture Belgrade a year later. At the subsequent Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, the Austrians gained possession of the Banat, Serbia and Lesser Wallachia. After Eugene's death in 1736, the Austrian conquests in Serbia and Wallachia were undone at the Battle of Grocka in 1739, where the outnumbered and disorderly Austrians were defeated by the Ottomans. As a result, with the Treaty of Belgrade (1739), the Habsburgs ceded Serbia (including Belgrade), the southern part of the Banat of Temeswar and northern Bosnia to the Ottomans, and Oltenia, gained by the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, to Wallachia (an Ottoman subject), and set the demarcation line to the rivers Sava and Danube. The Austro-Turkish War (1788‚Äì91) was an inconclusive struggle and Austrian territorial gains were meager in the Treaty of Sistova. The Austrians had occupied large territories including Bosnia, Belgrade and Bucharest but found themselves threatened by the imminent French Revolutionary Wars and diplomatic tensions with Prussia who threatened intervention. The gains from the enterprise came in the form of the town of Or»ôova in Wallachia and two small towns on the Croatian frontier. =19th century= Muslim Bosniak resistance during the battle of Sarajevo in 1878 against the Austro- Hungarian occupation. For the next 100 years, the Austrians and the Ottomans both began to slowly lose their power to the French, British, Prussians and Russians. Both the Ottomans and the Austrians lacked the heavy industry of their other European counterparts, but the Ottomans were further behind than the Austrians. Thus, Ottoman power decayed faster than Austrian power. In the Balkans, the increasingly prevalent nationalistic cries for independence became a bigger problem for the more militarily incompetent Ottomans. After 1867, the Austrians compromised with the Hungarians to form Austria-Hungary, thus preventing a major ethnic group from rebelling in the shorter term. The same benefits could not be had with the Ottomans. Efforts to catch up with European technology led officers and intellectuals to study abroad‚Äîa plan that backfired for the Ottomans when these individuals brought back European ideas of Enlightenment and egalitarianism. These ideas subsequently clashed with the traditional Turkish-dominated, autocratic, millet system of the Ottomans. Therefore, Ottoman power collapsed more rapidly than Austrian power, and they were powerless to stop Bosnia from being occupied in 1878 (officially annexed in 1908). =World War I= By the end of the war, the Habsburgs had shifted the balance of power away from the Ottomans Relations between Austria and the Ottomans began to improve when they saw a common threat in Russia and a common ally in Germany in countering the threat of the Tsar. The Ottomans had hoped the Germans would industrialize their nation to defend itself against the Russians, who had taken the \\"anti-Turk crusade\\" to a more committed level, driving the Turks out of the Crimea and Caucasus. Meanwhile, the German Empire of Prussia appealed to the Austrians through a common culture, language and the lenient terms imposed after the Austro-Prussian War. The Austrians were in no hurry to see Russia advance at the cost of the Ottomans towards their borders. Thus, in the years before World War I, the two former enemies found themselves allies against the French, the Russians and the British. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire surrendered to partition under the Treaty of Saint-Germain, as did the Ottomans under the Treaty of S√®vres.

She was built in 1918 and 1919 by the American International Shipbuilding Corp., Hog Island, Pennsylvania as SS Saluda . She was acquired from the War Shipping Board on 10 December 1921 and commissioned on 20 January 1922. Service history =Operations, 1922-1941= Sirius was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service carrying cargo and passengers in support of fleet units and bases. For many years, Sirius operated along the coasts of the United States. She operated on the east coast as far north as Boston, Massachusetts, and reached many ports in the Caribbean. Upon moving to the west coast, she operated from San Diego, California, to Bremerton, Washington. During 1929, 1930, and 1932, Sirius made numerous trips to and from Alaska with sealskins as her principal cargo. In 1934, she was attached to the Aleutian Island Survey Expedition and made cruises to many of the islands of Alaska, charting their waters as she went. Sirius continued her resupply operations to various United States naval bases and fleets until 1937 when she began making runs to Midway Island. Her scope of operations was increased in 1941 to include voyages to Wake Island.

From 1942 until 1944, she maintained a schedule of operating from Pearl Harbor to Johnston Island, Midway Island, San Francisco, Christmas Island, Canton Island, and Baker Island. The most noteworthy event of this period was when she transported 35 Imperial Japanese Navy prisoners (recovered from the Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry≈´) from Midway to Pearl Harbor in June 1942.Naval History and Heritage Command, Battle of Midway In July 1944, the Marshall Islands were added to her list of resupply ports as well as Guam and Saipan. Sirius returned to San Francisco on 20 November 1944 for an overhaul, departing that port on 12 February 1945 for Pearl Harbor. She continued her previous port calls until September when she was routed to Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, Admiralty Islands, for the first time. She departed from there for San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, Philippine Islands. The cargo ship operated in the Philippine Islands from 29 September until 2 December when she sailed for San Francisco, arriving there on 26 December 1945. =Decommissioning and sale= On 5 January 1946, Sirius began preparing for decommissioning by removing her cargo, guns, etc.; and, on 27 March, she moved to the Pacific Bridge Company Dock in Oakland, California. Sirius decommissioned on 26 April 1946; was struck from the Navy List on 5 June; transferred to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946; and sold to the Kaiser Co., on 29 September 1947, for scrap.

Their debut album, Stormin' , was their best-selling album, and was released in 1977 on Tabu Records, executive-produced by Clarence Avant and produced by Jerry Peters. It contained the disco hit single \\"Lovin' Is Really My Game\\", which was featured in the film 54 starring Mike Myers, and won the 1978 Billboard magazine Light Radio/Heavy Disco Record of the Year. The album also contained the radio hit \\"This Must Be Heaven\\" which is considered a soul classic, by virtue of its continued air play 34 years later. Other single releases from subsequent albums included 1978's \\"On Our Way Home\\", and \\"Hot for You\\", featuring Belita Woods on lead vocals. The members of the band (on the Stormin' album) were Belita Woods, bandleader and saxophonist Chuck Overton, Lamont Johnson on fretless bass and vocals (\\"This Must Be Heaven\\"), Renell Gonsalves on drums, Treaty Womack on vocals, percussion and flute, Bob Ross (a.k.a. Professor RJ Ross) on keyboards, Gerald (Jerry) Kent on guitar, Jeryl Bright on trombone, and \\"Leaping\\" Larry Sims on trumpet. Future Wham!/George Michael bassist, Deon Estus, was also a member of the band for a time. A teenage Regina Carter, who later became internationally known and respected as a jazz violinist, joined the band around 1978 and performed for a time with them. The Brothers Ali, Jerome and Jimmy (bass and guitar), joined about the same time in 1978, these days performing in Las Vegas and other venues. Members of Brainstorm continued their musical careers with other bands or in production. Woods later went on to perform as part of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective in touring sets around the world. Sims became the trumpeter for the Sounds of Blackness, which won two Grammy Awards during the 1990s. Bright went on to play trombone with the funk band Cameo for over twenty five years, and later released an album with other former Cameo members Aaron Mills, and Thomas TC Campbell, known as MCB (which was also the title of their album). Trenita (Treaty) Womack performs regularly with the Funk Brothers as well as a wide variety of other artists, and appeared in Standing in the Shadows of Motown (film), an award-winning documentary, as percussionist. Gerald (Jerry) Kent has produced a BMI-affiliated self- published CD in 2006, under the name Kent's Way Overdue entitled Tone Paintings, an original jazz-fusion guitar-based collection of instrumental cuts. He also plays guitar and bass with the IDMR Detroit Choir, which choir was used in the closing scenes of Standing in the Shadows of Motown (film), singing background harmony behind Chaka Khan in a Grammy 2003 winning performance of What's Going On. William Wooten, who joined the band after the first album playing keyboards, now tours with The Dramatics and The Spinners. Lamont Johnson released several solo albums and teaches bass. Renell Gonsalves performs with a wide variety of artists, as a skillful Latin-jazz percussionist (His father was renowned jazz saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, late of the Duke Ellington band).

Since February 2019, the Swedish operations of Net 1 are owned by Teracom, while the Norwegian operations are owned by Ice group. History Ice Norway's new logo, introduced in 2018. Nordisk Mobiltelefon was founded in 2003, and in 2005 received a ten-year licence from the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) to operate a digital CDMA2000 450 MHz mobile telephone network in Sweden, using the analogue NMT-450 band inherited from Telia. PTS, June 17, 2007 The NMT-450 and CDMA2000 networks greatly exceeded the range of GSM and its geographical coverage, and is extensively used by the logging industry and users in remote rural areas. Nordisk Mobiltelefon was co-founded by Arnfinn R√∂ste.arnfinnroste.se During 2008, the company introduced Ice.net which is the brand name that was used commercially until 2010 (in Denmark and Sweden). In February 2009 Nordisk Mobiltelefon went bankrupt, and U.S. based industrial group Access Industries subsequently took over the network on 10 March 2009, and continued to operate it under the Ice brand.Nordisk Mobiltelefon (Ice.net) bankrupt TeleGeography, February 23, 2009√ñverl√•telse av tillst√•nd att anv√§nda radios√§ndare enligt lagen (2003:389) om elektronisk kommunikation PTS, March 11, 2009 In Sweden and Denmark, the brand name Net 1 replaced the Nordisk Mobiltelefon name in May 2010. In Norway it remains ice, of which the latter introduced a new logo and branding in 2018. In 2015, Ice group acquired Network Norway, which made Ice the third mobile network operator (MNO) in Norway, following Tele2's exit from the Norwegian market that same year. Since then, Ice has implemented and continues to extend its own 4G LTE network, with national roaming on Telia Norge's network outside of Ice group's own mobile phone network. That same year, Net 1 acquired a minority stake in the Indonesian CDMA2000 mobile telephone operator Sampoerna Telekomunikasi Indonesia (id) and on 27 June 2017, the Net 1 Indonesia branding was introduced to replace Sampoerna's previous Ceria branding, after Sampoerna acquired a 4G LTE licence in the 450 MHz band (LTE band 31) for Aceh, Lombok, Maluku, Serang and South Sulawesi. In December 2018, Ice Group transferred its ownership of the non-Scandinavian operations to Net 1 International, who today handles operations for Net 1 Indonesia and Net 1 Philippines. Teracom subsequently acquired the Swedish operations of Net 1 from Access Industries on 25 February 2019. In March 2019, the Net 1 brand was officially launched in the Philippines. This is after Net 1 International entered a partnership with Citadel Holdings, Inc. to operate the internet service provider Broadband Everywhere (BE), which was subsequently renamed to Net 1 Philippines. The company currently holds the franchise to operate two frequencies in the Philippines: 450 MHz (awarded in 2006) and 3.5 GHz. The Net 1 network in the Philippines currently offers coverage in six provinces in Luzon: Bataan, Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Pampanga. Upgrade to 4G LTE In 2015, the networks in Norway, Sweden and Denmark were upgraded from CDMA to 4G LTE using the same 450 MHz frequencies (LTE band 31). The Norwegian subsidiary also holds other frequency licenses for its mobile phone network. The new LTE networks maintain the same extensive geographic coverage as the former NMT-450 and CDMA2000 networks, while greatly increasing speeds overall.

It also established a new tradition though of giving each component structure in the pyramid complex its own unique name. The structures together were known as \\"The places of the appearances of Amenemhet\\".  Construction  Archaeological evidence suggests that Amenemhet started to build his pyramid at Thebes but for unknown reasons switched his capital and the location of his pyramid to Lisht. The pyramid upon its completion rose to a height of 55 m, with a base length of 83 m and a slope of 54 degrees. The core of the pyramid was made with small rough blocks of local limestone with a loose fill of sand debris and mud brick. Some of the limestone was stripped from other monuments, blocks of stone from the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, Unas and Pepi II (or possibly Pepi I) have been found in the pyramid.Hans Goedicke, Re-used blocks from the pyramid of Amenemhet I at Lisht. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, 1971 Inside the pyramid a sloped shaft blocked with granite plugs upon burial ran from the ground level entrance chapel to a vertical shaft that descended directly to the burial chamber. The overall construction of the pyramid was poor and little of it remains today. Around the pyramid were found tombs of high officials serving the king. These include the tombs of the high steward Nakht, the treasurer Rehuerdjersen and the vizier Intefiqer. Excavation The entranceThe first excavation of the site was undertaken by the French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero in 1882. His work as later continued by a French archaeological expedition under the direction of J.E. Gautier and Gustave J√©quier in 1894 and 1895. The investigations were continued from 1920 to 1934 by Albert Lythgoe and Arthur Mace in a team from the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. By the time of these excavations the pyramid had undergone much disintegration and is now only 20 meters high with most of the surrounding complex gone. None of the expeditions successfully explored the interior of the pyramid due to the internal passageways being flooded with groundwater.

St. Louis 1988. It is a part of non-surgical periodontal therapy. This helps to establish a periodontium that is in remission of periodontal disease. Periodontal scalers and periodontal curettes are some of the tools involved. Plaque Plaque is a soft yellow-grayish substance that adheres to the tooth surfaces including removable and fixed restorations. It is an organised biofilm that is primarily composed of bacteria in a matrix of glycoproteins and extracellular polysaccharides. This matrix makes it impossible to remove the plaque by rinsing or using sprays. Materia alba is similar to plaque but it lacks the organized structure of plaque and hence easily displaced with rinses and sprays. Although everyone has a tendency to develop plaque and materia alba, through regular brushing and flossing these organized colonies of bacteria are disturbed and eliminated from the oral cavity. In general, the more effective one's brushing, flossing, and other oral homecare practices, the less plaque will accumulate on the teeth. However, if, after 24 hours in the oral environment, biofilm remains undisturbed by brushing or flossing, it begins to absorb the mineral content of saliva. Through this absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the saliva, oral biofilm is transformed from the soft, easily removable form into a hard substance known as calculus. Commonly known as 'tartar', calculus provides a base for new layers of plaque biofilm to settle on and builds up over time. Calculus cannot be removed by brushing or flossing. Plaque build up and bone loss Plaque accumulation tends to be thickest along the gumline. Because of the proximity of this area to the gum tissue, the bacterial plaque begin to irritate and infect the gums. This infection of the gum causes the gum disease known as gingivitis, which literally means inflammation of the gingiva, or gums. Gingivitis is characterized by swelling, redness and bleeding gums. It is the first step in the decline of periodontal health, and the only step which can be fully reversed to restore one's oral health. As the gingival tissue swells, it no longer provides an effective seal between the tooth and the outside environment. Vertical space is created between the tooth and the gum, allowing new bacterial plaque biofilm to begin to migrate into the sulcus, or space between the gum and the tooth. In healthy individuals, the sulcus is no more than 3 mm deep when measured with a periodontal probe. As the gingivitis stage continues, the capillaries within the sulcus begin to dilate, resulting in more bleeding when brushing, flossing, or at dental appointments. This is the body's attempt to clear the infection from the tissues. Thus, bleeding is generally accepted as a sign of active oral infection. The swelling of the tissue may also result in deeper reading on periodontal probing, up to 4 mm. At a depth of 4 mm or greater, the vertical space between the tooth and surrounding gum becomes known as a periodontal pocket. Because tooth brush and floss cannot reach the bottom of a gum pocket 4‚Äì5 mm deep, bacteria stagnate in these sites and have the opportunity to proliferate into periodontal disease-causing colonies. Once bacterial plaque has infiltrated the pocket, the transformation from biofilm into calculus continues. This results in an ulceration in the lining of the tissue, which begins to break down the attachment of the gum to the tooth. Gingival attachment begins to loosen further as the bacterial plaque continues to invade the space created by the swelling it causes. This plaque eventually transforms into calculus, and the process continues, resulting in deposits under the gum, and an increase in pocket depth. As the depth of the vertical space between the tooth and the gum reaches 5mm, a change occurs. The bacterial morphology, or make up, of the biofilm changes from the gram positive aerobic bacteria found in biofilm located supragingivally, or above the gumline. Replacing these gram positive bacteria of the general oral flora are obligate anaerobic gram negative bacteria. These bacteria are far more destructive in nature than their aerobic cousins. The cell walls of gram negative bacteria contain endotoxins, which allow these organisms to destroy gingival tissue and bone much more quickly. Periodontitis officially begins when these bacteria begin to act, resulting in bone loss. This bone loss marks the transition of gingivitis to true periodontal disease. In other words, the term periodontal disease may be synonymous with bone loss. The first evidence of periodontal disease damage becomes apparent in radiographs as the crestal bone of the jaw begins to become blunted, slanted, or scooped out in appearance. This destruction occurs as a result of the effect of bacterial endotoxins on bone tissue. Because the bone is alive, it contains cells in it that build bone, known as osteoblasts, and cells that break down bone, called osteoclasts. Usually these work at the same speed and keep each other in balance. In periodontitis, however, the chemical mediators, or by-products, of chronic inflammation stimulate the osteoclasts, causing them to work more rapidly than the cells that build bone. The net result is that bone is lost, and the loss of bone and attachment tissues is called periodontal disease. These processes will persist, causing greater damage, until the infectious bacterial agents (plaque) and local irritating factors (calculus) are removed. In order to effectively remove these at this stage in the disease process, brushing and flossing are no longer sufficient. This is due to several factors, the most important to note being the depth of the periodontal pocket. Brushing and flossing are effective only at removing the soft materia alba and biofilm in supragingival areas, and in pockets up to 3 mm deep. Even the best brushing and flossing is ineffective at cleaning pockets of greater depths, and are never effective in removing calculus. Therefore, in order to remove the causative factors that lead to periodontal disease, pocket depth scaling and root planing procedures are often recommended. Once the bacteria and calculus are removed from the periodontal pocket, the tissue can begin to heal. The inflammation dissipates as the infection declines, allowing the swelling to decrease which results in the gums once again forming an effective seal between the root of the tooth and the outside environment. However, the damage caused by periodontal disease never heals completely. Bone loss due to the disease process is irreversible. The gingival tissue of the gums also tends to suffer permanent effects once the disease reaches a certain point. Because gum tissue requires bone to support it, if bone loss has been extensive, a patient will have permanent recession of the gums, and therefore exposure of the roots of the teeth in involved areas. If the bone loss is extensive enough, the teeth may begin to become mobile, or loose, and without intervention to arrest the disease process, will be lost. Contrary to old beliefs, it is not a normal part of aging to lose one's teeth. Rather, it is periodontal disease that is the main cause of tooth loss in the adult population. Periodontal intervention Treatment of periodontitis may include several steps, the first of which often requires the removal of the local causative factors in order to create a biologically compatible environment between the tooth and the surrounding periodontal tissues, the gums and underlying bone. Left untreated, chronic inflammation of the gums and supporting tissue can raise a person's risk of heart disease. Prior to beginning these procedures, the patient is generally numbed in the area intended for instrumentation. Because of the deeper nature of periodontal scaling and root planing, either one half or one quarter of the mouth is generally cleaned during one appointment. This allows the patient to be entirely numbed in the necessary area during treatment. It is usually not recommended to have the entire mouth scaled at one appointment because of the potential inconveniences and complications of numbing the entire mouth- i.e., inability to eat or drink, likelihood of self injury by biting, etc. Generally, the first step is the removal of dental plaque, the microbial biofilm, from the tooth, a procedure called scaling. Root planing involves smoothing the tooth's root. These procedures may be referred to as scaling and root planing, periodontal cleaning, or deep cleaning. These names all refer to the same procedure. The term \\"deep cleaning\\" originates from the fact that pockets in patients with periodontal disease are literally deeper than those found in individuals with healthy periodontia. Such scaling and root planing may be performed using a number of dental tools, including ultrasonic instruments and hand instruments, such as periodontal scalers and curettes. A dental hygienist demonstrates scaling The objective for periodontal scaling and root planing is to remove dental plaque and calculus (tartar), which house bacteria that release toxins which cause inflammation to the gum tissue and surrounding bone. Planing often removes some of the cementum or dentine from the tooth. Removal of adherent plaque and calculus with hand instruments can also be performed prophylactically on patients without periodontal disease. A prophylaxis refers to scaling and polishing of the teeth in order to prevent oral diseases. Polishing does not remove calculus, but only some plaque and stains, and should therefore be done only in conjunction with scaling. Often, an electric device, known as an ultrasonic scaler, sonic scaler, or power scaler may be used during scaling and root planing. Ultrasonic scalers vibrate at a high frequency to help with removing stain, plaque and calculus. In addition, ultrasonic scalers create tiny air bubbles through a process known as cavitation. These bubbles serve an important function for periodontal cleanings. Since the bacteria living in periodontically involved pockets are anaerobic, meaning unable to survive in the presence of oxygen, these bubbles help to destroy them. The oxygen helps to break down bacterial cell membranes and causes them to lyse, or burst. Since it is of the utmost importance to remove the entirety of the deposit in each periodontal pocket, attention to detail during this procedure is crucial. Therefore, depending on the depth of the pocket and amount of calculus deposit versus soft biofilm deposit, hand instruments may be used to complete the fine hand scaling that removes anything the ultrasonic scaler left behind. Alternatively, power scalers may be used following hand scaling in order to dispel deposits that have been removed from the tooth or root structure, but remain within the periodontal pocket. Two ultrasonic instruments Sonic and ultrasonic scalers are powered by a system that causes the tip to vibrate. Sonic scalers are powered by an air- driven turbine. Ultrasonic scalers use either magnetostrictive or piezoelectric systems to create vibration. Magnetostrictive scalers use a stack of metal plates bonded to the tool tip. The stack is induced to vibrate by an external coil connected to an AC source. Ultrasonic scalers also include a liquid output or lavage, which aids in cooling the tool during use, as well as rinsing all the unwanted materials from the teeth and gum line. The lavage can also be used to deliver antimicrobial agents. Although the final result of ultrasonic scalers can be produced by using hand scalers, ultrasonic scalers are sometimes faster and less irritating to the client. Ultrasonic scalers do create aerosols which can spread pathogens when a client carries an infectious disease. Research differs on whether there is a difference in effectiveness between ultrasonic scalers and hand instruments. Of particular importance to dentists themselves is that the use of an ultrasonic scaler may reduce the risk of repetitive stress injury, because ultrasonic scalers require less pressure and repetition compared to hand scalers. A new addition to the tools used to treat periodontal disease is the dental laser. Lasers of differing strengths are used for many procedures in modern dentistry, including fillings. In a periodontal setting, a laser may be used following scaling and root planing in order to promote healing of the tissues. =After scaling= Following scaling, additional steps may be taken to disinfect the periodontal tissues. Oral irrigation of the periodontal tissues may be done using chlorhexidine gluconate solution, which has high substantivity in the oral tissues. This means that unlike other mouthwashes, whose benefits end upon expectorating, the active antibacterial ingredients in chlorhexidine gluconate infiltrate the tissue and remain active for a period of time. However effective, chlorhexidine gluconate is not meant for long-term use. A recent European study suggests a link between the long-term use of the mouthrinse and high blood pressure, which may lead to a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. In the United States, it is available only through a doctor's prescription, and in small, infrequent doses it has been shown to aid in tissue healing after surgery. Current research indicates the irrigation of CHX after SC/RP may inhibit the re-attachment of periodontal tissues. Specifically preventing the formation of fibroblasts. An alternate irrigation with povidone-iodine may be used - if no contra-indications exist. Site specific antibiotics may also be placed in the periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing in order to provide additional healing of infected tissues. Unlike antibiotics which are taken orally to achieve a systemic effect, site specific antibiotics are placed specifically in the area of infection. These antibiotics are placed directly into the periodontal pockets and release slowly over a period of time. This allows the medication to seep into the tissues and destroy bacteria that may be living within the gingiva, providing even further disinfection and facilitation of healing. Certain site specific antibiotics provide not only this benefit, but also boast an added benefit of reduction in pocket depth. Arestin, a popular site specific brand of the antibiotic minocycline, is claimed to enable regaining of at least 1 mm of gingival reattachment height. In cases of severe periodontitis, scaling and root planing may be considered the initial therapy prior to future surgical needs. Additional procedures such as bone grafting, tissue grafting, and/or gingival flap surgery done by a periodontist (a dentist who specializes in periodontal treatment) may be necessary for severe cases or for patients with refractory (recurrent) periodontitis. Patients who present with severe or necrotizing periodontal disease may have further steps involved in their treatment. These patients often have genetic or systemic factors that contribute to the development and severity of their periodontitis. Common examples include diabetes type I and type II, a family history of periodontal disease, and immunocompromised individuals. For such patients, the practitioner may take a sample from the pockets to allow for culture and more specific identification and treatment of the causative organism. Intervention may also include discontinuation of medication that contributes to the patient's vulnerability or referral to a physician to address an existing but previously untreated condition if it plays a role in the periodontal disease process. =Full mouth treatment= The \\"traditional\\" debridement procedure involves four sessions spaced two weeks apart, doing one quadrant (one quarter of the mouth) each session. In 1995 a group in Leuven proposed doing the whole mouth in about 24 hours (two sessions). When done using ultrasonic instruments this is called full mouth ultrasonic debridement (FMUD). The rationale for full mouth debridement is that quadrants that have been cleaned will not be reinfected with bacteria from quadrants that have not yet been cleaned. Other advantages of full mouth ultrasonic debridement include speed/reduced treatment time, and reduced need for anaesthesia, with equivalent results to scaling and planing. One study found that the average time to treat each pocket with full-mouth ultrasonic debridement was 3.3 minutes, whereas it took 8.8 minutes per pocket for quadrant scaling and root planing (SRP). Differences in improvement were not statistically significant. Studies by the Leuven group, using somewhat different protocols, found that the one-stage treatment (i.e. in 24 hours) gave better results than the quadrant-by-quadrant approach (taking six weeks). They also had the patients use chlorhexidine for two months after the treatment. =Depth of planing= Another question in dental cleaning is how much cementum or dentine should be removed from the roots. Bacterial contamination of root surfaces is limited in depth, so extensive planing away of cementum - as advocated by traditional scaling and root planing - is not necessary to allow periodontal healing and the formation of new attachment. In contrast to traditional scaling and root planing, the aim of some FMUD procedures is to disturb the bacterial biofilm within the periodontal pocket, without removing cementum. Typically, root planing will require the use of hand instruments such as specialized dental curettes instead of the scaler tips used in FMUD to debride the root surface and periodontal pocket. Evidence-based dentistry Several systematic reviews have been made of the effectiveness of scaling and root planing as evidence- based dentistry. A Cochrane review by Worthington et al. in 2013 considered only scaling and polishing of the teeth, but not root planing. After examining 88 papers they found only three studies that met all their requirements, remarking that \\"the quality of the evidence was generally low.\\" They reported mixed results: one study \\"did not show either a benefit or harm for regular six or 12-month scale and polish treatments when compared to no scale and polish\\", but an earlier study found that treatments every three months produced better results in terms of gingivitis, plaque and calculus than annual treatments (with evaluation after two years in each case). Oral hygiene instruction was found to help as well. Another inconclusive review of scaling and polishing (without planing) was published by the British Dental Association in 2015. An extensive review that did involve root planing was published by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health in 2016. It made a number of findings, including (1) In five randomized controlled trials, scaling and root planing \\"was associated with a decrease in plaque from baseline at one month, three months, or six months;\\" and (2) Four studies analyzed changes in the gingival index (GI) from the baseline and \\"found a significant improvement from baseline in the scaling and root planing group at three months and six months.\\" This study also discussed evidence-based guidelines for frequency of scaling with and without root planing for patients both with and without chronic periodontitis. The group that produced one of the main systematic reviews used in the 2016 Canadian review has published guidelines based on its findings. They recommend that scaling and root planing (SRP) should be considered as the initial treatment for patients with chronic periodontitis. They note that \\"the strength of the recommendation is limited because SRP is considered the reference standard and thus used as an active control for periodontal trials and there are few studies in which investigators compare SRP with no treatment.\\" They add however that \\"root planing ... carries the risk of damaging the root surface and potentially causing tooth or root sensitivity. Generally expected post-SRP procedural adverse effects include discomfort.\\" Enamel cracks, early caries and resin restorations can be damaged during scaling. A study conducted in 2018 recommended that teeth condition and restorations should be identified before undergoing the ultrasonic scaling procedures. Effectiveness of the procedure A scaling and root planing procedure is to be considered effective if the patient is subsequently able to maintain their periodontal health without further bone or attachment loss and if it prevents recurrent infection with periodontal pathogens. The long term effectiveness of scaling and root planing depends upon a number of factors. These factors include patient compliance, disease progress at the time of intervention, probing depth, and anatomical factors like grooves in the roots of teeth, concavities, and furcation involvement which may limit visibility of underlying deep calculus and debris. First and foremost, periodontal scaling and root planing is a procedure that must be done thoroughly and with attention to detail in order to ensure complete removal of all calculus and plaque from involved sites. If these causative agents are not removed, the disease will continue to progress and further damage will result. In cases of mild to moderate periodontitis, scaling and root planing can achieve excellent results if the procedure is thorough. As periodontitis increases in severity, a greater amount of supporting bone is destroyed by the infection. This is illustrated clinically by the deepening of the periodontal pockets targeted for cleaning and disinfection during the procedure. Once the periodontal pockets exceed 6 mm in depth, the effectiveness of deposit removal begins to decrease, and the likelihood of complete healing after one procedure begins to decline as well. The more severe the infection prior to intervention, the greater the effort required to arrest its progress and return the patient to health. Diseased pockets over 6 mm can be resolved through periodontal flap surgery, performed by a dental specialist known as a Periodontist. Although healing of the soft tissues will begin immediately following removal of the microbial biofilm and calculus that cause the disease, scaling and root planing is only the first step in arresting the disease process. Following initial cleaning and disinfection of all affected sites, it is necessary to prevent the infection from recurring. Therefore, patient compliance is, by far, the most important factor, having the greatest influence on the success or failure of periodontal intervention. Immediately following treatment, the patient will need to maintain excellent oral care at home. With proper homecare, which includes but is by no means limited to brushing twice daily for 2‚Äì3 minutes, flossing daily and use of mouthrinse, the potential for effective healing following scaling and root planing increases. Commitment to and diligence in the thorough completion of daily oral hygiene practices are essential to this success. If the patient fails to change the factors that allowed the disease to set in - for example, not flossing or brushing only once a day - the infection will likely recur. The process which allows for the formation of deep periodontal pockets does not occur overnight. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect the tissue to heal completely in a similarly short time period. Gains in gingival attachment may occur slowly over time, and ongoing periodontal maintenance visits are usually recommended every three to four months to sustain health. The frequency of these later appointments is key to maintaining the results of the initial scaling and root planing, especially in the first year immediately following treatment. Since the patient may still have pockets that surpass the effective cleaning ability of a brush or floss, for long-term success of their treatment they should return every 90 days in order to ensure that those pockets remain free of deposit. Patients should be explained that 90 days is not an arbitrary interval; at 90 days, the healing made possible by the scaling and root planing will be complete. This will allow the practitioner to re-measure pocket depths to determine whether the intervention was successful. At this appointment, progress will be discussed, as well as any refractory periodontitis. At 90 days from the original scaling and root planing, the periodontal bacteria, if any remain, will have reached their full strength again. Therefore, if there are remaining areas of disease, the practitioner will clean them again, and may place more site-specific antibiotic. Furthermore, this appointment allows for the review of homecare, or necessary additions or education.

Onset is typically after the age of 7 years and it is seen most frequently in the German shepherd dog, Pembroke Welsh corgi, and boxer dog, though the disorder is strongly associated with a gene mutation in SOD1 that has been found in 43 breeds as of 2008, including the wire fox terrier, Chesapeake Bay retriever, Rhodesian ridgeback, and Cardigan Welsh corgi. Progressive weakness and incoordination of the rear limbs are often the first signs seen in affected dogs, with progression over time to complete paralysis. Myelin is an insulating sheath around neurons in the spinal cord. One proposed cause of degenerative myelopathy is that the immune system attacks this sheath, breaking it down. This results in a loss of communication between nerves in lower body of the animal and the brain. Testing The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals has a DNA saliva test to screen for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. Now that a test is available the disease can be bred out of breeds with a high preponderance. The test is only recommended for predisposed breeds, but can be performed on DNA from any dog on samples collected through swabbing the inside of the animal's cheek with a sterile cotton swab or through venipuncture. The test determines whether the mutated copy of SOD1 is present in the DNA sample submitted. It must be interpreted with caution by a veterinary clinician in combination with the animal's clinical signs and other lab test results. The results reported are: * Normal / Normal (N/N, or 'clear'): The dog does not have the mutation and is extremely unlikely to develop degenerative myelopathy. There have been cases, however, in which dogs that tested clear were found to have DM upon necropsy. * Normal / Abnormal (N/A or 'carrier'): The dog has one mutated copy of the gene (is heterozygous) and is a carrier but will not have degenerative myelopathy though there has now been some cases of heterozygous carriers developing DM. It will be possible for it to pass the mutation to offspring. A thorough examination of the dog's pedigree and DNA testing should be undertaken prior to breeding a dog with this result. * Abnormal / Abnormal (A/A or 'At Risk'): The dog has two copies (is homozygous) for the mutation and is at risk for degenerative myelopathy. Genetics Breeding risks for degenerative myelopathy can be calculated using the Punnett Square: * If both parents are clear (N/N) then all of the puppies will be clear. * If one parent is a carrier (N/A) and one is clear (N/N) each puppy has a 50% chance of being clear and a 50% chance of being a carrier. * If both parents are carriers (N/A) each puppy has a 25% chance of being clear (N/N), 50% chance of being a carrier (N/A), and 25% chance of being affected and carrier (A/A) * If one parent is clear (N/N) and one parent is affected (A/A) then all puppies will be carriers (N/A) * If one parent is a carrier (N/A) and one is at risk (A/A) each puppy has a 50% chance of being a carrier(N/A) and 50% chance of being affected and carrier (A/A) * If both parents are at risk (A/A) then all puppies will be affected and carrier (A/A) Symptoms Degenerative myelopathy initially affects the back legs and causes muscle weakness and loss, and lack of coordination. These cause a staggering affect that may appear to be arthritis. The dog may drag one or both rear paws when it walks. This dragging can cause the nails of one foot to be worn down. The condition may lead to extensive paralysis of the back legs. As the disease progresses, the animal may display symptoms such as incontinence and has considerable difficulties with both balance and walking. If allowed to progress, the animal will show front limb involvement and extensive muscle atrophy and paralysis. Eventually cranial nerve or respiratory muscle involvement necessitates euthanasia or long term palliative care. Progression of the disease is generally slow but highly variable. The animal could be crippled within a few months, or may survive as long as three years or more. Causes The etiology of this disease is unknown. Recent research has shown that a mutation in the SOD1 gene is a risk factor for developing degenerative myelopathy in several breeds. Mutations in SOD1 are also associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) in people. More than 100 SOD1 gene mutations are involved in human familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the pathologic spinal lesions of ALS are similar to those of canine DM, making canine DM a potentially useful animal model of ALS. Known causes of spinal cord dysfunction should be excluded before accepting the diagnosis of degenerative myelopathy; disc disease (protrusions) or spinal cord tumors can cause compression of the spinal cord with similar signs to degenerative myelopathy.M. D. Lorenz and J. N. Kornegay. Handbook of Veterinary Neurology, Philadelphia:W.B. Saunders Company, 2004, pp 147-9. Treatment Degenerative myelopathy is an irreversible, progressive disease that cannot currently be cured. There are no treatments that have been clearly shown to stop or slow progression of DM. =Exercise= Exercise has been recommended to maintain the dog's ability to walk. Physiotherapy may prolong the length of time that the dog remains mobile and increase survival time. Canine hydrotherapy (swimming) may be more useful than walking. Use of a belly sling or hand-held harness allows the handler the ability to support the dog's hind legs for exercising or going up and down stairs. A 2-wheel dog cart, or \\"dog wheelchair\\" can allow the dog to remain active and maintain its quality of life once signs of weakness or paralysis of the hind limbs is detected. Prognosis The prognosis for the disease is generally poor. Aggressive therapy may be used to combat the disease, but even this puts the life expectancy at only around 14 months. It is recommended to put the dog to sleep at around 12 months, to prevent unnecessary suffering that comes from the disease. Some dogs have lived for many years with the disease, with one female boxer even living for 11 years. Without treatment, survival is around 3 months. The disease progresses rapidly without treatment, but this option arguably comes with less suffering. The dog begins to realize it is ill during the late stages. Some dogs have even appeared to be combating the disease on their own, walking on their own and doing exercise. The record survival without treatment is 14 years.

Set in the late 19th century, it was filmed on location in Cornwall, including scenes shot at Padstow and at Lanhydrock House near Bodmin, with Orsino and his followers wearing uniforms that evoke the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Plot Viola (Imogen Stubbs) and Sebastian (Steven Mackintosh) are young twins who, on Twelfth Night are performing on a ship and use their likeness to tease their audiences. During their journey, they are caught in a storm, shipwrecked and separated. Viola and other survivors end up on the shore of Illyria. A devastated Viola believes her brother dead. She later takes his appearance to join the court of the local Duke Orsino (Toby Stephens). The young woman has her long, beautiful hair cut by the sailor, conceals her breasts, and dresses like a boy. After that, Viola becomes a page, using the name \\"Cesario\\". Orsino is madly infatuated by Countess Olivia (Helena Bonham Carter), who is in mourning due to her brother's recent death. She uses the tragedy as an excuse to avoid seeing the Duke, whom she does not love. He sends \\"Cesario\\" to do his wooing and Olivia falls in love with the messenger, unaware of \\"Cesario\\"'s real gender. Realising Olivia's feelings for her alter ego, Viola is caught in even more of a quandary in that she is in love with Orsino. Meanwhile, elements of Olivia's household plot against her pompous steward Malvolio (Nigel Hawthorne) by tricking him into believing that Olivia loves him. (Malvolio even wears a toup√©e to appear younger than he is.) His attempts to woo her, however, are met with bewilderment by Olivia who has him committed, where he is subjected to further humiliations by Maria (Imelda Staunton), Feste (Ben Kingsley) and Sir Toby Belch (Mel Smith). Sir Toby, Olivia's uncle and a notorious drunk, is also trying to encourage his friend, the idiotic Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Richard E. Grant) to court Olivia, but she purposely ignores him. Sir Toby pushes Sir Andrew into challenging \\"Cesario\\" to a duel, which goes very badly for Aguecheek. Furthermore, Viola's twin, Sebastian, has in fact survived the wreck and has also arrived in Illyria, accompanied by Antonio (Nicholas Farrell), who saved him from drowning. Antonio, who has \\"many enemies in Orsino's court\\", is forced to flee when he is recognised and comes across \\"Cesario\\", whom he mistakes for Sebastian, and is outraged when \\"Cesario\\" fails to help him out. Arriving at her estate, Sebastian meets Olivia, who, mistaking him for \\"Cesario\\", talks him into marrying her. When he learns of this, Orsino is furious and dismisses his page, whom he had made a friend and confidante. However, the matter is soon cleared up when Sebastian and \\"Cesario\\" come face-to-face and the latter reveals her real nature and identity of Viola. Orsino marries Viola. The film ends with both couples holding a party to celebrate their marriages, while the supporting players, including the humiliated Sir Andrew and Malvolio, leave the estate with their heads held high and Feste sings his song, \\"The Wind and the Rain\\". Cast Differences with the play Extra dialogue was added at the beginning with Feste narrating the events surrounding the shipwreck and the separation of the twins and of a conflict between Viola and Orsino's native countries. Viola and the other survivors hail from Messaline and when they end up in Illyria they are forced to hide and live like fugitives since \\"Messaline with this country is at war\\" over some trading disputes: The Captain mentions \\"The war between the merchants here and ours\\" while hiding in the cave from Orsino and his men. In the original play the Captain claims to have been \\"bred and born not three hours' travel from\\" where they got washed ashore. The conflict is not mentioned again in the film (though it could be connected to Antonio's past as \\"Orsino's enemy\\"), and the Captain appears openly at the party at the end where he is embraced by Viola. Reception Twelfth Night: Or What You Will received positive reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 76%, based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Director Trevor Nunn makes some questionable choices, but his stellar cast -- which includes Helena Bonham-Carter, Ben Kingsley, and Nigel Hawthorne -- more than rises to the material.\\" Online film critic James Berardinelli writes, \\"With Twelfth Night, director Trevor Nunn (Lady Jane) follows in Branagh's footsteps by adapting one of the comedies for the screen. However, while this picture doesn't have quite the same level of style or energy evident in Much Ado About Nothing, solid performances and a lucid interpretation keep it afloat.\\" Berardinelli calls it \\"solid entertainment.\\" References External links * Category:Films based on Twelfth Night Category:1996 films Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:British films Category:British romantic comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Trevor Nunn Category:Films produced by David Parfitt Category:Films set in country houses Category:Irish films Category:Irish romantic comedy-drama films Category:Summit Entertainment films Category:1996 comedy films Category:1996 drama films ","title":"Twelfth Night (1996 film)"},{"id":"11823950","text":"Scouting and Guiding in Norway is served by the Speidernes Fellesorganisasjon, a federation of *Norges Speiderforbund (Norwegian Guide and Scout Association) *Norges KFUM-KFUK-speidere (YWCA-YMCA Guides and Scouts of Norway).

Writing career Her first book, Suds in Your Eye (1942) published by Houghton Mifflin, was described as \\"a crazy, funny story\\" about three impoverished but high-spirited and beer- loving elderly women. \\"The book was unlike most of the novels coming out of Southern California at the time\\", wrote Beatrice Sherman in The New York Times Book Review on December 13, 1942. This book was adapted into a Broadway Play by Jack Kirkland in 1944. Suds in Your Eye was followed by five other books about the same three women: Mrs. Feeley, Mrs. Rasmussen, and Miss Tinkham, plus their handyman, only known as \\"Old-Timer,\\" who never speaks. These included High Time (1944), One on the House (1949), Wait for the Wagon (1951), Tooner Schooner (1953), and Let's Go for Broke (1962), all with illustrations by famed The New Yorker artist George Price. Their home base for most of the series was called \\"Noah's Ark\\", and was a junkyard in San Diego, but the third and fourth books were set during travels. In the fifth book they moved away from Noah's Ark to an abandoned mansion eight miles from San Diego. These books consistently featured certain themes: the main characters faced financial disaster, usually were forced to take innovative measures to ensure a homeplace, rescued other people with problems, and acted as matchmakers. Among Lasswell's other books were Mrs. Rasmussen's Book of One-Arm Cookery (1946), I'll Take Texas (1958), and Tio Pepe (1968). Lasswell was also an editorial writer for the Houston Chronicle in the 1960s. Lasswell was born in Glasgow, Scotland, of American parents on February 8, 1905, and grew up in Brownsville, Texas. She was married to Dr. Dudley Winn Smith, a surgeon. She died at the Solvang Lutheran Home in Solvang, California of Alzheimer's disease.

These records consist of 683 pages of copies of letters from members of the public commenting on his performances, newspaper clippings, and documents reporting that Presley was the target of extortion attempts. Complaints, death threats and extortion attempts As rock singer Elvis Presley was a very popular star, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI had many files on him copied from FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and today archived on CD-ROM. According to Thomas Fensch,See Thomas Fensch, The FBI Files on Elvis Presley (New Century Books, 2001). the texts from the FBI reports dating from 1956 to 1981 represent a \\"microcosm [of Presley's] behind-the-scenes life.\\" For instance, the FBI was interested in death threats made against the singer, the likelihood of Elvis being the victim of blackmail and particularly a \\"major extortion attempt\\" while he was in the United States Army in Germany, complaints from outraged persons about his public performances, a paternity suit, the theft by larceny of an executive jet which he owned and the alleged fraud surrounding a 1955 Corvette which he owned, and similar things. The files do not collect anything investigational toward Elvis Presley.See Russ Kick, The Disinformation Book Of Lists: Subversive Facts and Hidden Information in Rapid-Fire Format (2004), p.98. A danger to the security of the United States The files deal with the sexual drives of the American youth aroused beyond normality by Elvis Presley. In a letter to J. Edgar Hoover dated May 16, 1956, for instance, a purported former member of the Army Intelligence Service states that Presley is a \\"definite danger to the security of the United States\\" because he had driven girls and boys mad. The letter says that Elvis's \\"actions and motions were such as to arouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. One eye-witness described his actions as 'sexual self-gratification on stage,' ‚Äì another as 'a strip-tease with clothes on.' The author further criticizes Elvis's \\"motions and gestures, like those of masturbation or riding a microphone,\\" and adds that \\"Indications of the harm Presley did...were two high school girls (...) whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph...It is known by psychologists, psychiatrists, and priests that teenaged girls from the age of eleven, and boys in their adolescence are easily aroused to sexual indulgence and perversion by certain types of motions and hysteria, ‚Äì the type that was exhibited at the Presley show. There is also gossip of the Presley Fan Clubs that degenerate into sex orgies..From eye-witness reports about Presley, I would judge that he may possibly be a drug addict and a sexual pervert.\\"See Thomas Fensch, The FBI Files on Elvis Presley, p.15-17. Endeavor to denounce the Beatles, the Smothers Brothers and Jane Fonda Ten days after Presley met with President Richard Nixon at the White House in 1970, the singer was granted a private tour of FBI headquarters. The FBI memo recounts Presley's visit and that he would like to advise FBI director Hoover \\"that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s.\\" In Presley's opinion, the source for the disaffected youth of the day owed to the existence of \\"the Smothers Brothers, Jane Fonda, and other persons in the entertainment industry of their ilk\\" because they had \\"poisoned young minds by disparaging the United States in their public statements and unsavory activities.\\"See also Peter Guralnick, Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley (1999), p.426. On Presley badmouthing the Beatles to President Nixon, see, in addition, Geoffrey Giuliano and Vmda Devi, Glass Onion: The Beatles in Their Own Words-Exclusive Interviews With John, Paul, George, Ringo, and Their Inner Circle (1999). However, unlike Nixon, Hoover refused to meet with Presley, who he described as \\"wearing of all sorts of exotic dress.\\"For more details, see Nick Redfern, Celebrity Secrets: Government Files on the Rich and Famous (2007); Anthony Summers, Official And Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover (1993). A major extortion attempt According to one of the best-documented files, Elvis Presley was the victim of Laurenz Johannes Griessel-Landau of Johannesburg, South Africa, a swindler and blackmailer who represented himself to be a medical doctor and skin specialist. =Details of the case= On 27 November 1959 Griessel-Landau was hired by Presley in Bad Nauheim, Germany, when the star was in the military service, to make skin treatments. However, during these treatments in December 1959, which involved Presley's shoulders and face and took place in the singer's quarters, the man had made several homosexual passes at the singer's friends from the Memphis Mafia and, according to Elvis biographer Peter Guralnick, at Elvis himself. According to the FBI files, Griessel-Landau :is alleged to have admitted to Presley that he is bisexual. His first homosexual experiences took place early in his life in the orphanage in which he was brought up. On 24 December 1959 Presley decided to discontinue the skin treatments. At the time that he told Griessel-Landau of this decision he also thoroughly censured Griessel-Landau for embarrassing him ... This drove Griessel-Landau into rage and he decided to extort sums of money from the singer or to ruin his career. The case was referred to the FBI. Elvis \\"was interviewed on 28 December 1959 concerning his complaint that he was the victim of blackmail...\\" According to the FBI files, Griessel-Landau \\"threatened to expose Presley by photographs and tape recordings which are alleged to present Presley in compromising situations.\\" An investigation determined that Griessel Landau was not a medical doctor. =Confidential treatment= Presley didn't take the matter to court. According to the FBI files, :Information concerning the subject was furnished to this office by the Provost Marshal Division, Hqs., United States Army, Europe, with the indication that they wished to avoid any publicity in this matter since they did not want to involve Elvis Presley nor put him in an unfavorable light since Presley had been a first-rate soldier and had caused the army no trouble during his term of service. =Final negotiation= Because things did not turn out the way he expected, Griessel-Landau endeavored to play the case down in letters he wrote on 27 and 28 December claiming that he sympathized with Elvis and that he had decided not to take action against the singer. The FBI files say that finally, :By negotiation, Presley agreed to pay Griessel-Landau $200.00 for treatments received and also to furnish him with a $315.00 plane fare to London, England. Griessel-Landau agreed to depart to England on 25 December 1959 at 19.30 hours from Frankfurt, Germany. [But] Griessel-Landau did not leave as agreed, rather returned and demanded an additional $250.00, which Presley paid. A day later Griessel-Landau made a telephonic demand for 2,000 ¬£ for the loss of his practice which he closed in Johannesburg, South Africa prior to his departure for Bad Nauheim to treat Presley. Then the blackmailer :departed Rhein-Main Air Field, Frankfurt, Germany at 16.00 hours, 6 January 1960 on Flight 491, British European Airway for London...He is alleged to be seeking entry into the United States. No contact between Presley and Griessel-Landau has been reported since 5 January. Notes Further reading *In his book The FBI Files on Elvis Presley (2001), Thomas Fensch reproduces actual texts from numerous FBI reports and reprints, in the appendix, many original documents as full-page illustrations, showing exactly how the FBI handled such cases. Pages 30‚Äì34 deal with Presley being the victim of Griessel-Landau. Among the documents the author provides are copies of the original FBI files concerning the case and letters from Griessel-Landau to Elvis and one of his secretaries. *Nick Redfern, Celebrity Secrets: Government Files on the Rich and Famous (Paraview Pocket Books, 2007) includes a section dealing with the FBI files on Presley.

'de Oliveira' literally means 'of the Olive Tree' and/or 'from the Olive Tree' and is a surname found mainly in Brazil, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Malta and to a much smaller extent to ex-Portuguese and Spanish colonies. 'de Oliveira' is a well known Sephardic surname as well. The surname ‚Äòde Oliveira‚Äô was used prior to the start of the Portuguese Inquisition as a way for Jews to avoid prosecution and under torture to become new Christians. Since those people were targeted, and since Portugal had just recently discovered Brazil (1500), many of those people fled to Brazil and other colonies of Portugal. Origin of the surname The surname identifies this family with the Olive Tree and the symbolic characteristics existing on the tree. On the coats of arms where it appears, it is the symbol of peace, of victory, of fame and immortal glory. In archaic Portuguese we find the register of surnames with variations of their spelling, such as Olveira and Ulveira. By the time of King Diniz I, king of Portugal in 1281, Oliveira was already \\"an old, illustrious and honorable family,\\" as the king's books of Inquisitions show. ‚ÄòOliveira‚Äô is classified in the genealogical-Jewish study as of proven Jewish origin. Before the Inquisition the ‚Äúde Oliveira‚Äù where also in Spain. Before the Islamist conquered the Iberian peninsula it was called ‚Äòha-Levi‚Äô or ‚Äòha-Itshari'. ‚ÄòDe Oliveira‚Äô who settled in Portugal, Galicia and Spain, adopted a translated form of their family name to disguise their Judean origin. And as according to USP historian Anita Novinsky - world authority in Portuguese Inquisition - 1 out of every 3 Portuguese who arrived in Brazil in the first decades of the 16th century after the discovery of Brazil by Pedro Alvares Cabral (he himself a new christian and member of the Order of Christ a Knights Templar order made exclusively of Judeans) were new Christians well over 2 million during the entire 16th century. The ‚Äòde Oliveira‚Äô and their cousins Benveniste and Antunes arrived largely and concentrated mainly in the Northeast Region and Minas Gerais State in southeast Brazil. The chronicles of the time themselves attest to the presence of Levi, Levy and de Oliveira families in large numbers in colonial Brazil. Rabbi Abraham Benveniste who was born in 1433, in the city of Soria, in the province of C√°ceres, in the Kingdom of Spain adopted the 'De Oliveira' family name in Portugal. He was a direct descendant of Rabbi Zerahi√° ben-Its'haq ha-Levi and Gerona, who lived in the 12th century and was called ha-Its'hari, or Its'hari, because his genealogy goes to the children of Its'har, who was uncle of the prophet Moshe Rabenu. 'De Oliveira' became internally among Judeans of the Diaspora the family name to be used exclusively by Judeans who could still trace and prove their genealogy to the tribe of Levy and to Judeans could trace and prove they were direct offspring of hebronites so both the priesthood and royal lineage took 'De Oliveira' so they could be later traced. They were also allowed to marry only among Levites and Hebronites themselves following biblical paternal lineage. It is noteworthy to mention that the offspring of the tribe of Levy and Hebron intentionally settled between Spain Galicia and Portugal for two reasons, first because it is inland and far from the great centers of Spain, where the first killings of Judeans or pogrons began, promoted by fanatical Catholic priests of the Dominican and Carmelite orders, which urged the ignorant old Christian population to kill the New Christian Jews and the unconverted Judeans and also gave them freedom to cross the borders among the different countries accordingly to the laws of each State. Toponymic ‚ÄòOliveira‚Äô is the Olive Tree that represented the nation of Israel as their Hebronite priestly and royal lineage and also for the olive oil itself that was used by the Levites to light the Menorah. Also the phoneme of the Latin letters, whose sounds represented the sound or phoneme of the Hebrew name Levy in the L-V-Y case. And it crossed their minds that in Semitic languages such as Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, and Amharic of Ethiopia, they do not use vowels in the written form of these languages, but only consonants. It was because of these linguistic mechanisms adopted by the Sephardim that many Judean families managed to escape the attacks of the Inquisition until they at least managed to escape the Iberian Peninsula. Controversy regarding the Ashkenazi \\"Cohen\\" The Sephardim never accepted the Ashkenazi Jews as part of the Israeli and Judean tribes. Matter of fact only in the 18th century the Ashkenazi established themselves as 'Jews' and 'Jewish People'. Hasdai Ibn Shaprut scholar physician and a prominent diplomat one the greatest leaders of the Diaspora called the Ashkenazi as 'proselytes from East Europe'. The sephardic medieval rabbi poet and philosopher Yehuda ha Levi expressed these same words to the King of the Khazars (Kitab Al Khazari III) from where the European Jews originate. The sephardic rabbi philosopher astronomer and physician Moses Maimonides also stated that the self-proclaimed Ashkenazi 'Cohen' or 'Cohen Priesthood' were not real priesthood for they were sons of Japheth not Shem and they had no lineage relation to biblical Israelites and Judeans for in the Torah there's no conversion much less the possibility of people who they affirmed was not seed of Yisrael and Aaron to be instated as priesthood. Another factor is the fact many Ashkenazi are changing their original names and adopting sephardic family names bringing confusion on the matter. Many ashkenazi have changed from their original names and adopted sephardic family names including the 'ha-Levi' family name although they are originally from Eastern Europe and have no relation whatsoever to the Sephardim ha-Levi/ha-Itshari/De Oliveira who do trace their origins to biblical Israel. One example is Ephraim Halevy an Ashkenazi lawyer and intelligence expert whose family changed their last name to the sephardic last name with no historical nor genealogical connection to the ha-Levi/ha- Itshari/De Oliveira lineage.

It lies about from the town of Grantham, just off the A607, and from Melton Mowbray. It borders the Duke of Rutland's estate at Belvoir Castle. Although the village is in Leicestershire, it has a Nottinghamshire postcode and a Lincolnshire (Grantham) STD code. Architecture The parish church of All Saints is a Grade II* listed building. It has a 13th-century tower at the west end and a chancel at the east end, separated by a 14th-century nave and a north aisle. A south aisle was added in 1869 by W. Thompson of Grantham. The churchyard includes two listed table tombs. Knipton's village hall was built as a Church of England primary school in 1850‚Äì1854 in a Mock Tudor style, on orders from the Duke of Rutland, and extended to the rear in 1868. The slate roof carries a tall spire above a louvred bell turret. The building has been Grade II listed since 1979, but ceased to serve as a school in the late 20th century.Knipton online ‚Äì Village Hall The village has a number of houses built for the Belvoir Estate, including a couple of cottages orn√©s from early Victorian times and some late 19th-century houses. Knipton Reservoir, built in the 1790s to supply water for the Grantham Canal, lies to the west of the village. Iron ore Iron ore was quarried in two areas of Knipton. Both quarries have now been smoothed over and the fields are at a lower level than the roads. =Southern quarries= These were an extension of the quarries at Woolsthorpe and Harston. Quarrying began east of the road from Knipton to Croxton Kerrial in 1924, ceasing in 1943. A quarry on the west side of the road operated in 1941‚Äì1946. The quarries used steam and diesel quarrying machines. Ore was removed by a steam- operated narrow-gauge tramway to a tipping dock on the standard-gauge railway at Harston, where it was tipped into standard-gauge trucks for transport. In 1956 quarrying resumed where it had finished in 1946. By that time the narrow- gauge tramway had been replaced by a standard-gauge one worked by steam locomotives, which brought the trucks to the sidings at Harston from where British Railways locomotives took them away. From 1960 onwards, the ore from some of the quarries was loaded into lorries to be taken to the tramway or the sidings at Harston. The tramway was lifted in early 1964, but the lorry-worked quarries continued for a while. Production at Knipton had ceased by the end of 1964. =Waltham Iron Ore Company quarries= Quarrying began at High Leys, close to the Belvoir Road in 1949. The quarry closed in 1951, to be replaced by Granby pit, closer to the village on the east side of the road. Granby closed in 1955, when quarrying began on the opposite side of the road at Harts Pit. Quarrying ceased at Harts in 1958. These quarries were served by an extension of the Waltham Iron Ore Tramway that transported ore to a tipping stage at the terminus of British Railway's Eaton branch. Diesel quarrying machines were used. The tramway was removed in 1959, and most of the remaining rolling stock was scrapped on site in 1960. One locomotive Cambrai was preserved by the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum and is now on loan to the Irchester Narrow Gauge Railway Museum. The Red House Inn The Manners Arms The village public house is now named the Manners Arms, after the family of the Duke of Rutland. Earlier there had been a Marquis of Granby in the village street. The Manners Arms occupies a late 18th-century brick building known as the Red House, with three bays and two-and-a-half storeys. It retains its slate roof and 19th-century plate-glass sash windows and shutters, and internally features an original closed-string staircase with a ramped handrail and turned balusters. Originally part of one of the few freehold pieces of land dating back to Anglo-Saxon times, and so not part of the Belvoir estate, the land was used for various purposes, including a maltings and squatters' cottages. The current building was built in 1774‚Äì1790 as a private house for the Rev. Robert Jones, the 5th Duke's chaplain. On Jones's death, the house passed to his son and upon his death to the son's wife. Her son, the estates clerk, mortgaged the building in 1802 for ¬£350. Unable to service the debt, he sold the building and mortgage to the 5th Duke for ¬£750. The house was modified in the late 1920s as the intended dower house for Violet, the 8th Duchess, but she decided to live at Eastwell Hall. The next plan was to subdivide the house into five flats, but this failed to materialise. When converted into a public house in the late 20th century, it was called the Red House Inn, but renamed the Manners Arms in 2005 at the behest of the 11th Duke of Rutland. Transport Knipton is served by three weekday buses a day between Melton Mowbray and Grantham.Bus times Retrieved 5 July 2017. Grantham is the nearest railway station (8.6 miles, 13.8 km).

Education and career Born on June 30, 1839, near Ottobine, Rockingham County, Virginia, Paul attended the common schools and Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia. He received a Bachelor of Laws in 1867 from the University of Virginia School of Law. He served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865, attaining the rank of Captain in the First Virginia Cavalry. He was admitted to the bar and entered private practice in Harrisonburg, Virginia from 1867 to 1877. He was commonwealth attorney for Rockingham County from 1870 to 1877. He was a member of the Senate of Virginia from Rockingham County from 1877 to 1880.Cynthia Miller Leonard (ed), The General Assembly of Virginia 1619-1978: A Bicentennial Register of Members (Richmond, 1978) pp. 528, 531 =Military service= During the Civil War, John Paul entered the Confederate States Army as a private in the Salem Artillery on May 1, 1861 along with his brother Paul (1846-1937), but by month's end, both had transferred to the 1st Virginia Cavalry where their brother Peter Paul Jr. (1842-1906) had enlisted. John Paul was wounded at Catlett's Station on August 22, 1862, returned to action and was promoted to 3rd lieutenant, then was wounded again and captured during the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse on May 7, 1864 and imprisoned at Fort Delaware.

He presented credentials as a member-elect to the 48th United States Congress and served from March 4, 1883, until September 5, 1883, when he resigned, having been appointed to a federal judicial post.

It was in operation from 1954 until 1979. The park was designed and built by Arto Monaco. In contrast to many more modern theme parks, Land of Makebelieve was a more low-key, whimsical attraction where children were encouraged to use their imagination. It allowed children to wander from place to place in the park as their whims guided them, without having to follow any sort of structured program or itinerary. As a park built strictly for children, parents were encouraged to just sit back and watch. Attractions and points of interest in the park were all built to half-scale, suitable for children age 12 and under. They included a castle, a riverboat, a train, several fairy tale houses, and a stagecoach and old western town. The park was permanently closed in 1979 after suffering extensive flooding damage from the nearby Ausable River. (Less damaging floods had occurred 11 times previously.) Some of the fairy tale houses that were undamaged were relocated to what was then a similar type park called Storytown, located in Queensbury, New York. That park is now the Six Flags-owned Great Escape. The official name of the park (on signs and literature) did spell \\"Makebelieve\\" as one word, in contrast to the more common \\"Make-Believe\\" or \\"Make Believe\\" forms. A 2006 Mountain Lake PBS documentary, \\"A CASTLE IN EVERY HEART: THE ARTO MONACO STORY\\" chronicles the life and work of Arto Monaco (1913-2003), the pioneering designer and gifted storyteller who was also responsible for Santa‚Äôs Workshop, another nearby children's attraction in the North Pole hamlet of Wilmington, NY. As a result of flood waters generated by Hurricane Irene on August 28, 2011, the last remaining building from the former park - the castle - was destroyed.

Executions were carried out elsewhere in the Papal States during their existence. Background Giovanni Battista Bugatti, executioner of the Papal States between 1796 and 1865, carried out 516 executions (Bugatti pictured offering snuff to a condemned prisoner in front of Castel Sant'Angelo). The death penalty had support from early Catholic theologians, though some of them such as Saint Ambrose encouraged members of the clergy not to pronounce or carry out capital punishment. Saint Augustine answered objections to capital punishment rooted in the first commandment in The City of God. Augustine's argument is as such: \\"Since the agent of authority is but a sword in the hand [of God], it is in no way contrary to the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' for the representative of the state's authority to put criminals to death\\". Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus argued that civil authority to carry out capital punishment was supported by scripture. Pope Innocent III required Peter Waldo and the Waldensians to accept that \\"secular power can, without mortal sin, exercise judgement of blood, provided that it punishes with justice, not out of hatred, with prudence, not precipitation\\" as a prerequisite for reconciliation with the church. During the Middle Ages and into the modern period, the Inquisition was authorized by the Holy See to turn over heretics to secular authority for execution, and the Papal States carried out executions for a variety of offences. The Roman Catechism (1566) codified the teaching that God had entrusted civil authorities with the power over life and death. Doctors of the Church Robert Bellarmine and Alphonsus Liguori, as well as modern theologians such as Francisco de Vitoria, Thomas More, and Francisco Su√°rez continued this tradition; Pope Pius XII issued an allocution to medical experts to that effect. History of the Statute The Lateran Treaty of 1929 copied from the contemporaneous Italian legal code (concerning attempted assassinations of the King of Italy), providing for capital punishment for anyone who attempted to assassinate the pope within Vatican City. Article 8 of the Lateran Treaty provides: There were no attempted assassinations of the pope within Vatican City while the statute was on the books. It was no longer in force in 1981, when Mehmet Ali Aƒüca attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and in any case Aƒüca was tried by an Italian court rather than in the Vatican. Abolition Pope Paul VI removed the capital punishment statute from the \\"fundamental law\\" of Vatican City in 1969, along with other adaptations, four years after closing the Second Vatican Council, announcing the change only in the August 1969 issue of the Gazette, which is published in Latin. The change came to public attention only in January 1971 after reporters accused Paul VI of hypocrisy for his criticisms of planned executions in Spain and the Soviet Union.

The first example flew in 1937. The 14-7 was a modern, low-wing cantilever monoplane with a fuselage intended to contribute lift to the design. Although the prototype flew with fixed tailwheel undercarriage, the 14-9 production version was the first US light aircraft to be mass-produced with retractable undercarriage; the main wheels rotated aft, up into wells in the wings. Operational history Development culminated in the 1941 14-12, at which point production ceased to allow Bellanca to work as a military subcontractor for the duration of the war when an attempt to market a militarized version as a trainer was unsuccessful.

DPT was quietly chartered in spring, 1999, by then-NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin, in coordination with the White House Office of Management and Budget, and led jointly by the NASA Headquarters Offices of Human Spaceflight and Space Science. It was created to generate and assess internally for NASA's most senior leadership innovative concepts and options that merged human and robotic space exploration. Specifically, the team developed options that could achieve major scientific goals over the subsequent 20 years using advanced technologies and taking advantage of the capabilities that astronauts made available on site.  Origins  Through the 1980s and 1990s, NASA was often criticized for having relatively unimpressive and uncompelling long-term plans for human spaceflight, although the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and servicing missions to the Hubble Space Telescope programs were notable engineering and management achievements. At the same time, NASA's science programs ‚Äì especially, the space sciences ‚Äì were widely regarded as successful examples of long-range planning and execution: the robotic Mars and outer Solar System missions, as well as the space astronomy programs. As a consequence, NASA Administrator Goldin, working with Agency senior leadership, created the Decadal Planning Team of about a dozen senior scientists, engineers, astronauts, and managers from its headquarters and all its centers. The activity was led from the start by Dr. James B. Garvin and Ms. Lisa Guerra. In contrast with numerous earlier ‚Äì and subsequent ‚Äì long-range planning teams that NASA chartered, the DPT avoided identifying a specific, overriding destination for human spaceflight (e.g., the Moon, Mars, asteroids, Lagrangian points). Instead, the DPT emphasized (mainly) technological ‚Äò‚Äôcapabilities‚Äô‚Äô that would be required for humans to travel throughout the inner Solar System to achieve multiple goals. The DPT was unique in NASA‚Äôs history in advocating the concept that specific destinations were not terminal venues, but rather should be treated primarily as ‚Äò‚Äôstepping stones‚Äô‚Äô -- sites for limited testing and demonstration before moving on to other locations of greater interest. Such a ‚Äò‚Äôgo anywhere, anytime‚Äô‚Äô philosophy and emphasis on a long-range commitment to enabling technologies remain controversial among many space advocates who instead urge national declarations of long-term human occupation specifically of Mars or the Moon. In addition, the DPT adopted scientific exploration and new discoveries as the primary justification for NASA and modeled the space agency‚Äôs mission on the goals that President Thomas Jefferson established for the Lewis and Clark Expedition almost exactly two centuries earlier. As such, the DPT remains the space agency‚Äôs most ambitious strategic planning effort to combine explicitly NASA‚Äôs science programs with human spaceflight. This philosophy has remained controversial with both scientists and human spaceflight advocates.  NASA exploration team  In early 2001, DPT expanded and became the NASA Exploration Team (NExT), which also reported directly to the agency‚Äôs most senior leadership and was led by Mr. Gary Martin. NExT had the additional responsibility to turn concepts and recommendations into specific mission designs, management plans, and priority technology investment strategies. Martin's appointment as Space Architect was announced in a NASA press release on October 11, 2002. The two teams were kept internal to the space agency and were almost unknown within NASA and by the media. This avoided likely and distracting influences from multiple external interest groups: aerospace industry, Congress, the ‚Äúspace press,‚Äù and academia. As such, neither DPT nor NExT were widely known, although their work presaged and significantly influenced the processes that led to President George W. Bush‚Äôs 2004 Vision for Space Exploration (VSE). The pioneering work of the DPT and NExT became more widely known when Goldin was succeeded as NASA Administrator by Sean O'Keefe in 2002. The position of Space Architect Office was then established to even further expand the work of the DPT and NExT, moving it into the mainstream of NASA programs. Mr. Martin became the first Space Architect, although the position was abolished by incoming NASA Administrator Dr. Michael D. Griffin. Although not widely known at the time, the Decadal Planning Team, the NASA Exploration Team, and the Space Architect's office prepared NASA leadership to coordinate its participation in developing the VSE during late 2003.

Inner Sanctum Records was a record shop in Austin, Texas. The retailer was variously cited as the first indie record shop in Texas and, at the time of its closure, the oldest in Central Texas.  History  In 1970, college student/entrepreneur Joe Bryson bought Phil's Record Store, which sat in a shotgun location at W. 24th and Rio Grande Streets, and renamed it Inner Sanctum Records, named after the 1940s radio show. The store would soon relocate to a large, old house at 504 W. 24th Street, just off \\"The Drag\\" (Guadalupe St.), near the University of Texas at Austin. This building also housed Aunt Sally's Bookstore, The Leather Bench and other businesses, as well as the offices of the political magazine The Texas Observer (when not running the store, Bryson would often visit the Observer offices in the presence of Molly Ivins and Kaye Northcott). Bryson increasingly relied on fellow music aficionados to keep the business running. James \\"Cowboy\\" Cooper, Gary Barnes, \\"Big Al\\" Ragle, Richard Dorsett, Rick Moore, Kirby McDaniel, Stephen Goodwin, and Linda Nozik all worked at the store. Between Cooper's knowledge and Bryson's enthusiasm, the store created a synergy that helped spawn progressive country. Inner Sanctum became one of the most influential record shops in the United States and the most popular independent store in Austin during the 1970s, coinciding with the emergence of the Southern California sound that influenced many Texas-based artists. The store became a source for recordings by Doug Sahm, Willie Nelson, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, The Lost Gonzo Band, Joe Ely, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Willis Alan Ramsey, Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, Waylon Jennings, George Jones, Jerry Jeff Walker, Michael Murphey (later known as Michael Martin Murphey), B. W. Stevenson, Billy Joe Shaver, Kinky Friedman, The Byrds and many others. The store became more successful and Bryson decided to move into a larger space in the building, but ended up having to keep the current space, as well. Thus, Inner Sanctum Too, was established as an auxiliary shop featuring classical music, and was managed by Kirby McDaniel and David Sobey. Meanwhile, the main store's inventory grew to include the entire spectrum of recorded music, featuring extensive catalog offerings of popular and progressive rock, R&B;, soul, blues, disco, jazz and what came to be known as world music. The store was also one of the first in the country to offer second-hand records for purchase. It also started a notorious practice of \\"renting\\" records for about $1 a day, a practice quashed by the major record labels when they became aware of it by the latter part of the decade.  Country to Punk  As the prog country \\"Cosmic Cowboy\\" trend lost momentum, the store staff embraced the growing punk rock trend with zeal. Importers became the store's most important suppliers, with shipments arriving at least once or twice a week with singles, LPs and magazines from the United Kingdom punk scene. Buyer Neil Ruttenberg made punk rock the store's specialty and helped catalyse punk's local popularity. DIY bands began rapidly appearing throughout Austin, which already enjoyed a reputation as a haven for live music. Inner Sanctum became the local source for recordings by artists such as the Sex Pistols, Devo, The B-52's, Joy Division, Throbbing Gristle, Stray Cats, Elvis Costello, The Clash, The Stranglers, Grace Jones, The Police, U2, Tears for Fears, OMD, and Simple Minds.  Supporting local music  As local bands began to record and release their own recordings, they could rely on the Inner Sanctum to stock them. To celebrate, the store would usually host a record release party with a keg and refreshments, lending a feeling of closeness to the scene. Some of these local acts included The Huns, Standing Waves, F-Systems, The Skunks (a band that featured \\"Fast Eddie\\" Munoz, a one- time Inner Sanctum employee and later a member of The Plimsouls, and following Munoz' departure, Jon Dee Graham), The Next, Terminal Mind, The Big Boys, The Dicks, The Norvells, Joe \\"King\\" Carrasco and the Crowns, D-Day, Delta, Radio Free Europe, The Explosives, Kamikaze Refrigerators, Sharon Tate's Baby, The Violators, The Inserts, The Judys (from Houston), and many more. Outside of punk and new wave, parties were held for Uncle Walt's Band (who performed in- store), Alvin Crow, soul band Extreme Heat, Butch Hancock, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Greezy Wheels, Roky Erickson, Uranium Savages, Joe Ely, Beto y Los Fairlanes and others. Doug Sahm and his friends frequently patronized the store. Major label recordings were subject to release parties, as well (such as an Elvis Costello Look-A-Like Contest upon the release of My Aim is True), or just a party to celebrate the fact that such artists, like The Plasmatics, Graham Parker, Joe Jackson, Robert Gordon & Link Wray, Tom Robinson Band, Magazine, and The Textones (Carla Olsson and Kathy Valentine), were performing in town. Most of the staff were also musicians, band managers or otherwise involved with the local music scene. In 1976, McDaniel started a Sunday night radio show, Rock Of Ages, on the UT radio station KUT. He played a wide spectrum of music that was readily available in the store. By 1978, Stephen Goodwin started making appearances as \\"The Old Codger\\" and other regular guests dropped by, like Paul Ray (of The Cobras and the KUT program Twine Time), disco DJ Casey Jones, writer Joe Nick Patoski, playwright Greg Barrios and Neil Ruttenberg. When McDaniel exited the show in 1979, Ruttenberg (taking on the moniker of \\"Rev. Neil X\\") took the reins at the height of the punk‚Äìnew wave era. When he departed, he relayed the controls to store manager Jack Kanter in 1981. Both Ruttenberg and Kanter's editions of the show occasionally featured live performances in the studio from artists like Alex Chilton. Kanter's show was visited regularly by The Big Boys (featuring Randy \\"Biscuit\\" Turner). Kanter also served for a while as manager of the band Delta, while another staffer, Will Sharp, managed The Next.  Location  504 W. 24th St. came to be known as Bluebonnet Plaza, and housed a head shop (Pipes Plus), a hair salon, and other businesses along with Inner Sanctum. Two popular restaurants flanked the building on either side: Octopus' Garden (later Mad Dog & Beans) and Les Amis Cafe, the latter of which was featured in the motion picture Slacker and the subject of a 2005 documentary, Viva Les Amis. Demise Following the departures of both Kanter and Ruttenberg in the early 1980s, Bryson eventually sold the store. By 1997, property values throughout Austin had increased dramatically, and Inner Sanctum and the other tenants of Bluebonnet Plaza were forced to vacate when the owners decided to renovate the building.

Musical achievements Taking after his banjo playing father, John Bouchillon, Chris became a musician. Along with his brothers, Charlie and Uris, he formed the Bouchillon Trio. Chris played the mandolin and provided vocals, while Charley played fiddle and Uris played guitar.

He retired from professional music during The Great Depression. Creation of the \\"talking blues\\" Bouchillon developed his trademark \\"talking\\" way of singing because of his supposedly horrible singing voice. His recording director reportedly loved to listen to him talk however, and recommended he re-record a few songs by talking instead of singing.

The game was later ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992. Outside Japan, the port was released under the name Two Crude Dudes. In the game, players control one of two mercenaries hired by the American government to stop the terrorist organization \\"Big Valley\\". Their objective is to retake control of a ruined New York City from Big Valley after a nuclear explosion the group caused. Gameplay Players control the characters by jumping, dodging and attacking their way through legions of enemies. Because the main characters are muscle-bound brawlers, they have the ability to pick up objects well beyond their own weight (e.g. cars and traffic lights) to use as weapons. They can do the same to most enemies as well. While playing co-op, it is also possible for one player to pick up the other to use as a projectile. Each player has a life bar, which decreases each time they're hit. Some enemies can grab onto the players and drain their life. A player loses a life when his life bar reaches zero. If the hit that finishes a player is an explosion or flame, he slumps to the ground burnt. The life bar can be fully refilled between stages, with a cut scene showing the player(s) punching a \\"Power Cola\\" vending machine causing sodas to fall out which they drink, those vending machines also featured in most stages as replenishment points.

Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Two Crude on their April 15, 1990 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

He continued his computer science education in the United States, and received an M.S. degree from University of Minnesota Duluth in 1991. He wrote about his time at the University of Minnesota Duluth: Singhal continued his studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and received a Ph.D. degree in 1996. At Cornell, Singhal studied with Gerard Salton, a pioneer in the field of information retrieval, the academic discipline which forms the foundation of modern search.

The lake is approximately a 45-minute drive from Ottawa  Recreation  Swimming is permitted on the beach and is even guarded by lifeguards. Campsites are available on the coast of Lac Philippe. One may rent paddle-boats, kayaks, and canoes however. An admission fee is charged when driving into the park during the camping season. The lake is known for its family-friendly picnic areas and its clean water.  Environmental Issues  Lac Philippe's ecological health has been under great stress from litter contamination, due to the level of human usage of the water body. 2017 saw the greatest ratio of water quality 'fail' grades (12%) to 'pass' grades (88%) compared to any year since at least 2011, which is a strong indicator of the lake's overall health in 2017. Upon walking around the shoreline, one may find such items sitting in the water's edge as inflated air mattresses and beer cans. Conservation measures should focus on litter reduction and limitation/elimination of external toxins (for example: hygiene products, food, bits of plastic, and toxic runoff from nearby campsites).

The company promises as much as 60 percent returns on investments and drew many of its investors from the church.

And has said that the cause of the financial problems at the King's Capital financial group was the economic crisis rather than a deliberate fraud. As of April 2011 the case has not been taken to court. Criticisms On 28 December 2008, nine leaders of evangelical churches in Ukraine signed a statement in which they, among other things, dissociate themselves from Sunday Adelaja and his activity.

He considers it unfortunate that patriotism does not apply to all Ukrainians. \\"Only through the nationalistic mood can the Ukrainian nation become independent at all. If Ukrainians do not become more nationalistic, I am afraid that this country may come back under the Russian or Polish or Hungarian or some other yoke\\".Pastor Sunday Adelaja supports Ukrainian nationalism, Christian Telegraph (October 27, 2008) Adelaja thinks racism is not typical of the Ukrainian society. \\"I think it is a more Russian phenomenon, which came here. But Russia also sees how bad racism is for a country's reputation\\". Adelaja was a strong supporter of the Orange Revolution. \\"Twelve years ago we were freed from Communism. Though we have had a different government with different uniforms since, the same corrupt people have remained in power. Now, Ukraine has its first opportunity to choose our own free way of life.\\" He stated about the then candidate in and later winner of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election Viktor Yushchenko: \\"He is a committed believer who is serious about his faith, and is influenced by God and the Bible\\".Ukraine's Political Crisis Has A Christian Side , Free Reformed Churches of North America (January 2005) However, during the 2010 president elections Adelaja decided and called all affiliated churches to vote for Victor Yanukovich, the opponent of the \\"Orange\\" leaders (Tymoshenko and Yushchenko).

From 1945 until his death he served as chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the annual Boyer Lectures on Radio National are named in his honour. Early life and student career Boyer was born at Taree, New South Wales, the third and youngest son of a Wesleyan minister. He attended Wolaroi College, Orange, and Newington College (1901‚Äì1909).Newington College Register of Past Students 1863‚Äì1998 (Syd, 1999) pp19 At the University of Sydney he graduated BA in 1913 and MA Hons in 1915. Boyer joineded the Methodist ministry and in 1914 and 1915 was a probationer in the Canberra circuit. Grazing career Instead of returning to the ministry, Boyer became a jackeroo and in 1920 acquired a 38,652 acre (15,642 ha) property named Durella, near Morven, Queensland and married his former war nurse Eleanor Muriel Underwood. The Boyers succeeded as sheep farmers and he became president of the Warrego Graziers' Association in 1934 and, following a visit to Europe in 1935, increased his involvement in the affairs of the wool industry. As President of the United Graziers' Association of Queensland (1941‚Äì44) and of the Graziers' Federal Council of Australia (1942), he gained tax concessions for pastoral improvements and sat on the Australian Meat Industry Commission. Durella was put under management and the Boyers moved to Brisbane in 1937 and to Sydney in 1940. He sought opportunities in public service and avoided domestic politics. He was appointed honorary director of the American division of the Department of Information and in 1942 and 1945 he went abroad for conferences of the Institute of Pacific Relations. As President of the Commonwealth Council of the Australian Institute of International Affairs, he launched the journal, Australian Outlook. In the 1940s and 1950s Boyer devoted his formidable energies to the Australian national committee of the United Nations Appeal for Children, to Sydney Rotary Club's international service committee and to the Good Neighbour Council. Broadcasting career In 1940 Boyer was appointed a member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and five years later became chairman. With the introduction of television in 1954 the ABC was given responsibility for the national service. In 1956 Boyer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and declined the post of high commissioner to Canada. The following year he initiated the annual lectures that were later to bear his name. He died at Wahroonga and was survived by his wife, daughter and son. Legacy Boyer stood at the center of Australia's media world, and took the lead in the subtle cultural war underway. He fought the pull of American popular culture, with its widespread popularity and the risk, he felt, of degrading the public taste. He favoured the supposedly superior traditional culture of the mother country, which appealed to upscale audiences that were representative of the nation's elite. As chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Boyer fought against commercialism because he feared it would lead to American dominance. He held up the BBC model of a publicly owned and operated broadcasting commission as being able to maintain Australia's British heritage.Simon J.

On his father's death in 1630, he became briefly lord of Acquasparta.  Biography  Federico Cesi was born to an aristocratic family highly connected in Rome and the Papal States. The family derives its name from Cesi, a little town near Rome. They had a close connection with the Catholic Church, Frederico's uncle Bartolomeo Cesi was a cardinal in the church, and most of their wealth came from that connection.galileo.rice.edu Federico Cesi (1585-1630) and the Accademia dei Lincei, by Luigi Belloni Federico was the first of eleven legitimate male children and was born in Palazzo Cesi, in via della Maschera d'Oro, Rome, February 26, 1585. His father was Federico, marchese di Monticelli (1562‚Äì1630)Federico, marchese di Monticelli, son of Angelo, first duca di Acquasparta (1588), and first principe di San Polo and Sant'Angelo (1613), married Olimpia Orsini di Mentana, 12 March 1616 (Gottardo Garollo, Dizionario biografico universale, s.v. \\"Cesi\\"); she commissioned the chapel of Saint Francesco in the Church of the Ges√π. and his mother was Olimpia Orsini of Todi. In 1614 Cesi was married to Artemisia Colonna, the daughter of Francesco, principe di Palestrina; she died two years later. In 1617 he married to Isabella, cousin of Filippo Salviati, the daughter of the Marquis of Lorenzo. In 1618 he moved to Acquasparta and lived there until his death at the age of forty-five. The Accademia dei Lincei (\\"Academy of the Lynxes\\") In 1603, at the age of eighteen, Cesi invited three slightly older friends, the Dutch physician Johannes van Heeck (in Italy Giovanni Ecchio), and two fellow Umbrians, mathematician Francesco Stelluti of Fabriano and polymath Anastasio de Filiis of Terni to join with him in the founding of the Accademia dei Lincei (\\"Academy of the Lynxes\\"), aimed at the understanding of all natural sciences through a method of research based upon observation, experiment, and the inductive method. Their goal was to penetrate the secrets of nature, observing it at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. The four men chose the name \\"Lincei\\" (lynx) from Giambattista della Porta's book \\"Magia Naturalis\\", which had an illustration of the fabled cat on the cover and the words \\"...with lynx like eyes, examining those things which manifest themselves, so that having observed them, he may zealously use them\\".Della Porta's Life - From Giambattista Della Porta Dramatist by Louise George Clubb - Princeton University Press Princeton, New Jersey, 1965 Cesi chose the sharp eyed lynx and the eagle for the Academy's symbols. The academy's motto, chosen by Cesi, was: \\"take care of small things if you want to obtain the greatest results\\" (minima cura si maxima vis). Since it was an uncertain time to conduct scientific research ‚Äî in 1578 the Inquisition had closed Giambattista della Porta's Academia Secretorum Naturae in Naples under suspicion of sorceryfaculty.ed.umuc.edu, \\"Giambattista della Porta (1535-1615)\\", 2006 Jeff Matthews ‚Äî the Accademia dei Lincei had rough beginnings. Cesi's own father forbade Cesi's association with the other three men, suspecting them of undermining his authority and trying to separate his son from family interests. The four \\"Lynxes\\" soon returned to their native cities and continued to communicate only by letter, adopting astronomical pen names: Cesi, perpetual president, was Cel√≠vago.Dizionario biografico universale Cesi traveled to Naples where he met della Porta, who he seemed to have been corresponding with for some time. There he described his academy to Della Porta, who encouraged Cesi to continue with his endeavors. The academy managed to survive due to Cesi's resources as a rich nobleman and his diplomatic skills in navigating the politics of Counter-Reformation Rome. Cesi managed to expand the ranks of the Academy, recruiting Giambattista della Porta himself in 1610 and Galileo Galilei in 1611. Cesi's letter to Galileo of 21/7/1612 mentioned Kepler's ellipses. Cesi's Academy published Galileo's Istoria e dimostrazione intorno alle macchie solari (Letters on Sunspots) in 1613, The Assayer in 1623, and also had a hand in defending Galileo in his controversies with establishment leaders and ecclesiastical authorities. Cesi's own intense activity in the Academy was cut short by his sudden death in 1630 and the original Accademia dei Lincei did not survive his death. It was revived in its currently well known form of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, by the Vatican, Pope Pius IX in 1847. The plant genus Caesia was named in his honour.

Moser & Sohne (ca 1900) Bohemian glass, chiefly referred to as Bohemia crystal, is glass produced in the regions of Bohemia and Silesia, now parts of the Czech Republic. It has a centuries long history of being internationally recognised for its high quality, craftsmanship, beauty and often innovative designs. Hand-cut, engraved, blown and painted decorative glassware ranging from champagne flutes to enormous chandeliers, ornaments, figurines and other glass items are among the best known Czech exports and immensely popular as tourist souvenirs. The Czech Republic is home to numerous glass studios and schools attended by local and foreign students. The oldest archaeological excavations of glass-making sites in the region date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia. Other notable Czech sites of glass-making throughout the ages are Skalice (), Jablonec nad Nisou, ≈Ωelezn√Ω Brod, Podƒõbrady, Karlovy Vary, Kamenick√Ω ≈†enov () and Nov√Ω Bor (). Several of these towns have their own glass museums with many items dating to around 1600. Jablonec nad Nisou in particular is famous for the local tradition of manufacturing glass costume jewellery. Its long history is documented by large collections in the Museum of Glass and Jewellery in Jablonec nad Nisou. Among the most famous Czech glass producers are: Moser (considered the most luxurious Czech brand), R√ºckl (the glass from them is owned, for example, by the British Queen Elizabeth II), and Crystalex (the largest Czech producer of drinking glasses, own trademark Bohemia Crystal). Crystal vs. glass The meaning of crystal versus glass changes according to the country. The word \\"crystal\\" means, in most of the Western world, the presence of lead. In the European Union, the labeling of \\"crystal\\" products is regulated by Council Directive 69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition and properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% lead oxide may be referred to as \\"lead crystal\\". Products with less lead oxide, or glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be labeled \\"crystallin\\" or \\"crystal glass\\".http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal- content/en/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=l2btJx1QfVjGS26hd7RQHJT2pC6jtyHh219TZXbGQ3pPJZrSf8dP!-2071614142?uri=CELEX:31969L0493 In the United States it is the opposite - glass is defined as \\"crystal\\" if it contains only 1% lead. In the Czech Republic, the term \\"crystal\\" is used for any exquisite, high quality glass. Leaded crystal means crystal containing more than 24% lead oxide. The presence of lead in crystal softens the glass and makes it more accessible for cutting and engraving. Lead increases the weight of the glass and causes the glass to diffract light. Glass can contain up to 40% lead, if maximum hardness is desired. On the other hand, crystal can contain less than 24% lead if it has a high proportion of barium oxide, which ensures high quality light diffraction.http://www.ecrystal.cz/en/czech- crystal/ History Bohemia, currently a part of the Czech Republic, became famous for its beautiful and colourful glass during the Renaissance. The history of Bohemian glass started with the abundant natural resources found in the countryside. Bohemian glass-workers discovered potash combined with chalk created a clear colourless glass that was more stable than glass from Italy. In the 16th century the term Bohemian crystal was used for the first time to distinguish its qualities from glass made elsewhere. This glass contained no lead as is commonly suspected. This Czech glass could be cut with a wheel. In addition, resources such as wood for firing the kilns and for burning down to ashes were used to create potash. There were also copious amounts of limestone and silica. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, gem cutter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels. During the era, the Czech lands became the dominant producer of decorative glassware and the local manufacture of glass earned international reputation in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750. Czech glassware became as prestigious as jewellery and was sought-after by the wealthy and the aristocracy of the time. Czech crystal chandeliers could be found in the palaces of the French king Louis XV, Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria, and Elizabeth of Russia. Bohemia turned out expert craftsmen who artfully worked with crystal. Bohemian crystal became famous for its excellent cut and engraving. They became skilled teachers of glass-making in neighbouring and distant countries. By the middle of the 19th century, a technical glass-making school system was created that encouraged traditional and innovative techniques as well as thorough technical preparation. In the second half of the 19th century, Bohemia looked to the export trade and mass-produced coloured glass that was exported all over the world. Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour cased glass. These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with coloured lithographic prints copying famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. Reverse glass painting was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a bevelled wooden frame. Glass artisanship remained at a high level even under the Communists because it was considered ideologically innocuous and it helped promote the good name of the country. Czech glass designers and manufacturers enjoyed international recognition and Czech glassware including art works such as sculptures was displayed and awarded in many international exhibitions, most notably in Expo 58 world fair in Brussels and in Expo 67 in Montr√©al. Today, Czech crystal chandeliers hang, for example, in Milan's La Scala, in Rome's Teatro dell'Opera, in Versailles, in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg or in the royal palace in Riyadh. Various sorts of glassware, art glass, ornaments, figurines, costume jewellery, beads and others also remain internationally valued. One of the glass items for which the Czech nation is still well known is the production of \\"druk\\" beads. Druks are small (3mm-18mm) round glass beads with small threading holes produced in a wide variety of colors and finishes and used mainly as spacers among beaded jewellery makers.

Bowman in 1914. Background Years earlier, a friend of Bowman known only as \\"Raggedy Ed\\" declared his intention to open a strip club on 12th Street while the two were walking along it. Bowman is rumored to have said \\"If you get rich on those three balls, I'll write a piece on three notes to make myself rich.\\" The result was \\"The 12th Street Rag,\\" one of the most famous and best-selling rags of the ragtime era. It was more than 15 years after Bowman composed the song before he actually wrote the music down in manuscript form. He returned to Texas briefly and tried to sell the piece to a company in Dallas; but he only had an offer of ten dollars for it and was told it really was not worth publishing. Returning to Kansas City, he sold it to Jenkins Music Company in 1913. The Jenkins company felt Bowman's arrangement was far too difficult however, hiring C. E. Wheeler to simplify it. With a big advertising push \\"12th Street Rag\\" began to sell better. In 1919, James S. Sumner added lyrics. The song was popular with early Kansas City bands and became a huge hit after Bennie Moten recorded it for RCA Victor in 1927, the same year that Louis Armstrong and His Hot Seven recorded it. It has since become an enduring jazz standard. Other recordings Euday Bowman, the composer, recorded and published his own recording of the piece, on Bowman 11748. Louis Armstrong and His Hot Seven recorded the song for Okeh Records in Chicago in May 1927. Krazy Kat and his orchestra perform the music in the 1930 cartoon The Bandmaster.

Donald Peers recorded the song in London on March 26, 1949. It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalogue number B 9763\\\\. Popular culture The song is perhaps best known in the UK as the theme to The Joe Franklin Show; the version most associated with the program was Big Tiny Little's 1959 recording from his album Honky Tonk Piano (Brunswick BL (7)54049).

He is best known for his friendship with Edgar Allan Poe and his controversial defense of the poet after his death. Born into a wealthy Georgia family, Chivers became interested in poetry at a young age. After he and his first wife separated, he received a medical degree from Transylvania University but focused his energy on publishing rather than medicine. In addition to submitting poems to various magazines and journals, Chivers published several volumes of poetry, including The Lost Pleiad in 1845, as well as plays. Edgar Allan Poe showed an interest in him and encouraged his work. Chivers spent the last few years of his life defending the reputation of Poe, who had died in 1849, though he also thought Poe had been heavily influenced by his own poetry. Chivers died in Georgia in 1858. As a literary theorist, Chivers believed in divine inspiration. He encouraged the development of a distinctive American style of literature and especially promoted young writers. His poems were known for religious overtones with an emphasis on death and reunions with lost loved ones in the afterlife. Though he built up a mild reputation in his day, he was soon forgotten after his death. Life and work Chivers was born on October 18, 1809,Nelson, 47 at Digby Manor, his father's plantation near Washington, Georgia.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 260. At age seven, he was introduced to poetry when he read William Cowper's \\"The Rose\\".Parks, 166 In 1827, Chivers married his 16-year-old cousin Frances Elizabeth Chivers. The two soon separated due to alleged meddling by Frances Chivers Albert, the wife of the poet's uncle, prior to the birth of their daughter in 1828.Watts, 113‚Äì114 It has also been suggested their separation was due to abuse, though these rumors originated from the same uncle.Lombard, 13 After this incident, Chivers compared himself to Lord Byron, whose wife had also left him.Hubbell, 551 Chivers went on to receive a degree in medicine in 1830 from Transylvania University in Kentucky. His thesis was titled \\"Intermittent and Remittent Fevers\\". Chivers wandered throughout the West and North of the United States, publishing poetry in various places before returning to Georgia. In 1832, Chivers published The Path of Sorrow, a collection of poetry based on the events of his troubled first marriage. Two years later, he published Conrad and Eudora; or, The Death of Alonzo, the first fictionalized account of the actual 1825 murder case nicknamed the \\"Kentucky Tragedy\\". The work was later renamed Leoni, The Orphan of Venice.Whited, 404-405 On November 21, 1834, Chivers married Harriet Hunt of Springfield, Massachusetts and the couple had four children, though all died young.Lombard, 14‚Äì15 Chivers and his first wife never legally divorced‚Äîone such suit was dismissed in court in 1835‚Äîbut Georgia law invalidated marriage after a spouse's absence of five years or more.Lombard, 12 Though Chivers contributed to various newspapers and magazines, his poetry was turned down for publication by the Southern Literary Messenger in March 1835, which suggested he return to medicine and the \\"lancet and pill-box\\". Though the poems were not printed, unsigned commentary on them was presented in an editorial, referring to verses submitted by \\"T. H. C., M. D.\\"Lombard, 14 The Lost Pleiad was self-published in New York in 1845 to initial success, though sales rapidly declined.Lombard, 46 In 1837, Chivers self-published Nacoochee; or, the Beautiful Star, With Other Poems. The volume was dedicated to his mother, who died a year later.Lombard, 38 =Relationship with Edgar Allan Poe= Edgar Allan Poe Chivers is best known for his association with Edgar Allan Poe and, in fact, it is through this relationship that Chivers and his work was rediscovered in the 20th century.Hubbell, 550 The first interaction between the two was in 1840 though they did not meet until 1845 in New York.Lombard, 99 The two became friends and Chivers was willing to give Poe lifetime financial support if he moved to the South.Kennedy, 54 Chivers appreciated Poe's ability and wrote that George Rex Graham was seriously underpaying Poe for his work on Graham's Magazine. \\"He ought to give you ten thousand dollars a year... It is richly worth it... [Graham] is greatly indebted to you. It is not my opinion that you have ever been, or ever will be, paid for your intellectual labours. You need never expect it, until you establish a Magazine of your own\\", he wrote, referring to Poe's plans to begin The Stylus.Thomas & Jackson, 465 Even so, Chivers was concerned about Poe's reputation as a severe literary critic, cautioning him about \\"when you tomahawk people\\".Meyers, 140 Poe, in fact, had been hoping Chivers would lend his wealth as a financial backer for The Stylus and possibly even serve as a co-editor in its early planning stages.Silverman, 189‚Äì190 Chivers considered Poe's proposal but was not able to accept because of the death of his three- year-old daughter just over a week later.Silverman, 190 Poe had written about Chivers in the second part of his \\"Autography\\" series, published in Graham's Magazine in December 1841. Poe said: The two had corresponded through letters but finally met in June or July 1845. Chivers visited Poe when Poe was sick and bedridden and when Poe's wife Virginia was in an especially difficult period of her struggle with tuberculosis. Chivers later recalled that Poe's voice was \\"like the soft tones of an Aeolian Harp when the music that has been sleeping in the strings is awakened by the Breezes of Eden laden with sweet Spices from the mountains of the Lord\\". By September 1845, however, Chivers was lecturing Poe on the dangers of alcohol. A Prohibitionist, he said Poe was wasting his God-given talents by indulging in drink. \\"Why should a Man whom God, by nature, has endowed with such transcendent abilities, so degrade himself into the veriest automaton as to be moved only by the poisonous steam of Hell-fire?\\" he said. While Poe's wife Virginia was sick, Chivers had to carry Poe home after a night of excess. Moreover, as attested to in an 1848 pamphlet titled Search After Truth, Chivers disagreed with Poe regarding aesthetics. This small booklet presents a series of dialogues between the Seer [Chivers] and Politian [Poe]. For Chivers, a poet should be a Shelleyan or Swedenborgian visionary intent on capturing mystic realms of experience in language. For Poe, the poet is merely a superior wordsmith. The wise Seer ultimately leads Politan to the truth.Chivers, Thomas Holley. Search After Truth. New York: Scholar's Facsimiles & Reprints, 1976. =After Poe's death= After Poe's death, Chivers accused Poe of plagiarizing both \\"The Raven\\" and \\"Ulalume\\" from his own workMoss, 101 though other critics suggested Chivers's Eonchs of Ruby were a \\"mediocre restatement\\" of Poe's poems.Lombard, 17 The first poem of the collection, \\"The Vigil of Aiden\\", was an homage to Poe, using names like \\"Lenore\\" and the refrain \\"forever more!\\"Lombard, 62‚Äì63 On July 30, 1854, Chivers published an essay called \\"Origin of Poe's Raven\\" under the pseudonym Fiat Justitia, claiming that he inspired Poe to use trochaic octameter and the word \\"nevermore\\" in \\"The Raven\\".Parks, 182. Chivers also suggested in the Georgia Citizen that Poe learned to write poetry from him. As literary scholar Randy Nelson wrote: \\"anybody who's read both Poe and Thomas Holley Chivers can see that one of them 'influenced' the other, but just who took what from whom isn't clear.\\"Nelson, 212 Even so, Chivers continued to praise and admire Poe (albeit careful to point out Poe's literary debt to him) and was one of the first to present a picture of the \\"real Poe\\" in the face of the sustained attacks on Poe's reputation by the Reverend Rufus Wilmot Griswold, the poet's literary executor. This correction took the form of a memoir now titled Chivers' Life of Poe, not published until 1952. Chivers said of Griswold that he \\"is not only incompetent to Edit any of [Poe's] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, owe the dead.\\"Chivers, 70 Chivers continued to defend Poe's reputation until the end of his life. =Final years and death= From 1845 to 1850, Chivers had been living with his wife in Georgia, then spent the next five years in the North. His poetry collection Eonchs of Ruby, A Gift of Love was published in 1851 with a subtitle meant to capitalize on the gift book trend. Chivers explained the title: \\"The Word Eonch is the same as Concha Marina‚ÄîShell of the Sea. Eonch is used... merely for its euphony.\\"Lombard, 61 Throughout the collection, Chivers experiments with the sonic effects of words rather than their literal meaning.Lombard, 76 Atlanta: or the True Blessed Island of Poesy: A Paul Epic in Three Lustra was first published in three installments in the Georgia Citizen beginning in January 1853.Lombard, 77 Later that year, Memoralia; or, Philas of Amber Full of the Tears of Love was printed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and generally received unfavorably.Lombard, 85 Very shortly after, the same publisher brought out Virginalia; or, Songs of My Summer Nights, a collection made up of poems that were generally under 200 lines each, about half of which had previously been published in magazines.Lombard, 89 By 1855, Chivers and his wife had moved back to Georgia and he predicted that the slavery issue would soon force his home state to break from the United States.Lombard, 97 A slaveholder himself, Chivers did not believe that slaves should be abused, though he still defended the institution against abolitionists.Lombard, 114 Struck with sudden illness, Chivers wrote his will before dying on December 18, 1858, in Decatur, Georgia.Lombard, 18 His last words were, \\"All is perfect peace with me.\\"Hubbell, 552 His last published work, a drama titled The Sons of Usna, had been published earlier that year. At the time of his death, Chivers had prepared several manuscripts of his literary theory with the intention of publishing them in several volumes of books and as part of a lecture series.Parks, 183 In his will, he left one dollar for his first wife and their daughter. He is buried in Decatur Cemetery. Poetic theory and literary reputation In his poetry, Chivers made use of legends and themes from Native American culture, particularly the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones.Lombard, 28 He was also heavily influenced by the work of Fran√ßois- Ren√© de ChateaubriandLombard, 24 and Emanuel Swedenborg.Lombard, 29 Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife.Silverman, 259 Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death. Chivers believed in a close connection between poetry and God and that true poetry could only be written through divine inspiration. He once wrote: \\"Poets are the apostles of divine thought, who are clothed with an authority from the Most High, to work miracles in the minds of men\\".Parks, 158 He also wrote: \\"Poetry is the power given by God to man of manifesting... the wise relations that subsist between him and God\\", and it \\"is that crystal river of the soul which runs through all the avenues of life, and after purifying the affections of the heart, empties itself into the Sea of God\\".Hubbell, 553 In Nacoochee, the preface states: \\"Poetry is that crystal river of the soul which runs through all the avenues of life, and after purifying the affections of the heart, empties itself into the Sea of God.\\" In his introduction to Atlanta, written in 1842 but not published until 1853, Chivers gives a lengthy discussion of his poetic theory, pre-dating many ideas Poe would suggest in \\"The Poetic Principle\\" (1850). Chivers, for example, suggests that poems should be short to be successful: \\"No poem of any considerable length... can be pleasing to any well-educated person for any length of time\\".Lombard, 78 He also experimented with blank verse as early as 1832 and his 1853 collection, Virginalia, included mostly poems using blank verse.Lombard, 121 At least for a time, he considered Elizabeth Barrett Browning the best contemporary English poet.Parks, 169 Like many from his time, Chivers called for the development of a distinctive American literature and he especially encouraged young writers.Parks, 174 Poe called the 1845 poetry collection The Lost Pleiad \\"the honest and fervent utterance of an exquisitely sensitive heart.\\" Overall, he called Chivers \\"one of the best and one of the worst poets in America\\".Thomas & Jackson. 353 William Gilmore Simms offered conditional praise of Chivers's poetry as well: \\"He possesses a poetic ardor sufficiently fervid, and a singularly marked command of language. But he should have been caught young, and well-bitted, and subjected to the severest training... As an artist, Dr. Chivers is yet in his accidence.\\" Simms also commented that his works were too gloomy and melancholy. Chivers was one of a group of poets criticized for \\"intensity of epithet\\" in Bayard Taylor's verse parody The Echo Club and Other Literary Diversions (1876).Wermuth, Paul C. Bayard Taylor. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1973: 164. . Though Chivers built up a mild reputation during his lifetime, counting Algernon Charles Swinburne among his admirers, his fame faded away quickly after his death. Other writers that acknowledged his influence included Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti.Lombard, 132 Others, however, were more critical. One anonymous reviewer, possibly Evert Augustus Duyckinck, joked that Chivers was formulaic and suggested the formula included 30% Percy Bysshe Shelley, 20% Poe, 20% \\"mild idiocy\\", 10% \\"gibbering idiocy\\", 10% \\"raving mania\\" and 10% \\"sweetness and originality\\".Moore, Rayburn S. \\"A New Look at Thomas Holley Chivers\\", The Southern Literary Journal, vol. 13, no. 1. Fall 1980: University of North Carolina Press: 131. Literary scholar S. Foster Damon wrote that Chivers would have had a stronger reputation if he were born in the North and \\"the literary coteries there would surely have pruned and preserved him...

He was born in Francestown, New Hampshire. Growing up during the civil war. He and his brothers/colleagues, helped the effort of the North with their conciderible creativity and imagination, by creating propaganda. A second- generation artist affiliated with the Hudson River School, Shattuck differed from most of his contemporaries in that he never studied abroad, and appears to have spent his entire life in New England.Biography, Utah Museum of Fine Arts Shattuck studied portrait painting with Alexander Ransom in Boston in 1851, and in 1852 was a student at the National Academy of Design in New York City. In 1854 he first painted in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The following year he exhibited for the first time at both the National Academy and the Boston Athenaeum. In 1856 he was elected an associate of the National Academy, and was made a full Academician in 1861. From 1856 to 1870 Shattuck worked at the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City. In 1860 he married Marian Colman, sister of Samuel Colman.Timeline, NHHS In 1879 he moved to West Granby, Connecticut, where his paintings focused on his farm and its animals. In 1883 he invented a canvas stretcher bar key which was used by artists of the era, and which contributed to Shattuck's considerable wealth.Biography, UMFA In 1888 Shattuck suffered the effects of a serious illness, after which he ceased to paint. After recovering he followed other agrarian and creative pursuits, raising sheep, experimenting with apple tree grafts, and making violins. Prior to his death in 1928 at the age of 96 he was the oldest living member of the National Academy of Design.

She earned awards and critical praise for her novels about race relations and the struggles of immigrant families in America. Life The fifth child and third daughter of Jewish immigrants, Ruth Seid was born in Brooklyn, New York on July 1, 1913, the daughter of Nathan Seid and his wife, Ida (Kravetsky). In an effort to escape the blinding poverty in which they lived, the Seid family moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1916, but her parents were unable to find the prosperity they sought. After attending local public elementary schools, she enrolled at John Hay High School, where she concentrated on studies in English and journalism. After graduating at 17 as the class valedictorian, Seid found employment as a clerk- typist and began attending night classes at Cleveland College. With the onset of the Great Depression, however, she was soon unemployed and she and her family sought public assistance. Sinclair worked in a factory and on a project for the Works Progress Administration (WPA); she served as assistant publicity director for the Cleveland American Red Cross; and she was an editor, secretary, and saleswoman. Seid spent five years working for the WPA, writing, editing and doing historical research on areas of interest in Ohio. She eventually became an editor on the Foreign Language Newspaper Digest. The WPA was one of the most important accomplishments of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935‚Äîpart of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's \\"New Deal.\\" This government office hired unemployed Americans to work on various government projects. Many of these projects were similar to ones sponsored by the Public Works Administration. Writing While employed by the WPA, she spent her free time developing her own projects, writing short stories and articles. In 1937, Seid, using the pseudonym of Jo Sinclair, sold her first story to Esquire which appeared in the January 1938 issue. That year proved to be a turning point for the struggling writer as she also placed stories and articles with New Masses, Ken, and Coronet. A local benefactor arranged to provide her with an annual stipend so she might concentrate on producing a novel. While she completed a draft, Seid was unhappy with it, and the same fate befell her second attempt. Although she felt she had disappointed her benefactor, she did not abandon her writing. To support herself and her family, Seid accepted a position in publicity with the American Red Cross in 1941, where she remained until after World War II. During this period, Seid continued to turn out stories and articles, placing several in prestigious periodicals. The spring 1941 issue of Common Ground included \\"Red Necktie,\\" which many considered to be one of her finest efforts. Her work also appeared in Harper's, The Crisis, the Jewish Spectator, and Crossroad. Several of her stories were included in anthologies. In 1945, Seid's completed manuscript, Wasteland, won the Harper Prize for the best novel about American life. The book dealt with the problems facing second-generation Russian Jewish immigrants, including a disdain for tradition and a shame over family.Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature: First Supplement, edited by Stanley J. Kunitz, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1955. With the $10,000 prize, Seid was able to provide for herself and her family. It also helped that her novel earned respectful reviews. She went on to write three more novels: Sing at My Wake (McGraw, 1951); The Changelings (McGraw, 1955); and Anna Teller (McKay, 1960). Although Wasteland is the best known of Sinclair's novels, the later books seem more powerful and sensitive. Sinclair is much more successful when she presents female characters and when she attempts to show the integration of international, emotional, spiritual and religious features of the individual life. The Changelings presents the problems of a changing environment (the influx of blacks into a neighborhood of Eastern European immigrants) on the children of the community. The emotional trauma of change and the pain of hate are fully experienced by the young Judith Vincent. Her novels Sing at My Wake and Anna Teller portray the pain of youth, the complexity of the parent-child relationship and the rarity of sexual fulfillment in a woman's life. Sing at My Wake was based almost entirely on the true story of Seid's close friend Margaret Lyons Diederich, Margaret's estranged husband, Thomas, and their son, Thomas Jr. (all three natives of Cleveland, Ohio). Catherine Ganly, the heroine in Sing at My Wake, presents the unhappiness of a woman's existence in 20th-century America. As a child her mercurial mother baffles her and as a young wife her husband's depression destroys her sexual satisfaction. Only in her affair with Paul Randolph, a sculptor, does Catherine realize herself as a woman. But this sexual awakening is a conflation of sex and death. The fictional Anna Hurvitz Teller is, on the other hand, the prototypical strong immigrant woman who overcomes this unhappiness of the 20th-century American female by sheer determination. Perceived by outsiders, the Teller home is perfection; experienced by the participants, the home is a depressed one. In this novel, Sinclair associates Jewishness with pain and deformity and depression with sexual dissatisfaction. Though Sinclair is often included in discussions of American-Jewish novelists, her interest in the painful psychology of the 20th-century human transcends the boundaries such a category suggests. Her characters must confront their own pasts as well as learn to accept the values and pasts of others. In Anna Teller, the Tellers' Jewishness is also quite peripheral. Emil feels unidentified with Jewish peoplehood, but joining a temple does not assuage his pain; acceptance of his mother as a strong, but human and loving woman does. In Sing at My Wake, the only characters who are Jewish are Phil and Anne Barron, friends of the heroine. Seid published only four novels in her career. She was much more at home with the short story, many of which have appeared in anthologies. She also produced a volume of memoirs, The Seasons: Death and Transfiguration, (Feminist Press, 1993). Seid continued to produce short stories and articles although her output slowed somewhat as she aged. She succumbed to cancer on April 4, 1995 at the age of 81 at her home in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.New York Times  Literature  * Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center * Jewish Women's Archive (JWA) * Boston University's Library Catalog  References  Category:20th-century American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:1913 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Works Progress Administration workers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:Writers from Brooklyn Category:Writers from Cleveland Category:Novelists from New York (state) Category:Novelists from Ohio Category:American women short story writers Category:20th-century American short story writers Category:Deaths from cancer in Pennsylvania Category:Pseudonymous women writers Category:Pseudonymous writers ","title":"Jo Sinclair"},{"id":"11825102","text":"Matthew Kelly, also known as Matt Kelly, is an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He plays guitar and harmonica. Kelly is best known for being the leader of the rock band Kingfish, and for his association with Bob Weir and the Grateful Dead. Career Matthew Kelly began his musical career in the late 1960s, playing harmonica with some well-known blues artists, including Mel Brown, Champion Jack Dupree, Johnny Lee Hooker, and T-Bone Walker. During this period, Kelly was also involved in the burgeoning rock music scene in the San Francisco Bay Area. He played electric guitar and harmonica in several different psychedelic rock bands, along with fellow South Bay musicians Dave Torbert and Chris Herold. Subsequently, Kelly lived in England for a number of months, and was a member of the rock band Gospel Oak. Upon his return to California, he renewed his association with Dave Torbert, who was then playing bass in the New Riders of the Purple Sage. Kelly would also sometimes hang out with a boyhood friend of his, Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. During this period Kelly occasionally performed as a guest musician with the New Riders or the Dead. He appeared on one track of the 1973 Dead album Wake of the Flood. In 1973, Torbert left the New Riders of the Purple Sage, and he and Kelly formed the band Kingfish, along with Chris Herold, Robbie Hoddinott, and Mick Ward. In 1974, the Grateful Dead went on hiatus, and Weir became a full-time member of Kingfish, recording and performing with the band extensively. In 1976, the Dead started touring again, and Weir left Kingfish. Kingfish continued playing many live dates, occasionally with Weir in the lineup, and released several more albums. In 1978, Kelly played on a few tracks of the Grateful Dead album Shakedown Street. He also played on several songs at the December 31, 1978 Dead show that was later released on CD and DVD as The Closing of Winterland. Kingfish disbanded, for a time, in 1980. In 1981, Kelly became one of the original members of Bob Weir's band Bobby and the Midnites, and appeared on the band's self-titled first album, along with Brent Mydland, Billy Cobham, Alphonso Johnson, and Bobby Cochran. In 1983, Dave Torbert died. The following year, Matt Kelly reformed Kingfish. From that time on, Kelly led a gradually evolving lineup of musicians, as Kingfish intermittently toured and released live albums. In 1987, Kelly also released a solo album, A Wing and a Prayer. In 1995, Bob Weir formed a new band, Ratdog. Kelly was an original member of that band, along with Rob Wasserman and Jay Lane. Kelly played guitar and harmonica in Ratdog until 1998. The intermittent existence of Kingfish, led by Matthew Kelly, continues to the present time. In 1999, the band released a studio album, Sundown on the Forest. They have also released a number of live albums of older material.

Its name was taken from a Delaware Indian term meaning ‚Äúthe red ceder\\". Established in 1790, The Ho-Ho-Kus Inn was once known as The Mansion House and consists of five rooms: Chateau, Crystal, Hermitage, Tap, and Zabriskie. History The Ho-Ho-Kus Inn was originally a private residence built for John ‚ÄúJake‚Äù Zabriskie in 1790. After his death the house was converted into a private church and served as a parsonage for the Christ Episcopal Church in Ringwood. During this time the Ho-Ho-Kus Inn had been referred to by several nicknames such as Zabriskie House, the Villa Inn, The Mansion House, the Wayside Inn, and the Washington Inn. The building later became a resting house for the New York elite until 1920 and was referred to as Mansion House during this time. In 1920 the house faced demolition but was saved by Mrs. H.T.B. Jacquelin. In 1941 the house was purchased by the town and became a landmark and was leased to several people. In 2007 the restaurant was bought by Chris Kelly. Kelly had asked George Zahakos and Catherine Stauch, formerly of the Bicycle Club in Englewood Cliffs, to take over the restaurant however this deal has fallen through. Reviews The Ho-Ho-Kus Inn is currently a Zagat rated restaurant. New York Times food critic David Corcoran has given high praises to the manager Rob Lipkin for his energetic attitude and for importing first-rate wine from regions like Chile and South Africa. Lipkin won awards as sommelier at the Petit Chateau in Bernardsville. He also praised the chef, Jesus Murillo, for his grilled ostrich which he described as \\"remarkably tender and juicy, bolstered by a zesty cherry chutney\\".

Space motion LP 145-141 may be a member of the Wolf 219 moving group, which has seven possible members. These stars share a similar motion through space, which may indicate a common origin. -- see table 5. This group has an estimated space velocity of 160 km/s and is following a highly eccentric orbit through the Milky Way galaxy. Properties White dwarfs are no longer generating energy at their cores through nuclear fusion, and instead are steadily radiating away their remaining heat. LP 145-141 has a DQ spectral classification, indicating that it is a rare type of white dwarf which displays evidence of atomic or molecular carbon in its spectrum. LP 145-141 has only 75% of the Sun's mass, but it is the remnant of a massive main- sequence star that had an estimated 4.4 solar masses. While it was on the main sequence, it probably was a spectral class B star (in the range B4-B9). Most of the star's original mass was shed after it passed into the asymptotic giant branch stage, just prior to becoming a white dwarf. Search for companions A survey with the Hubble Space Telescope revealed no visible orbiting companions, at least down to the limit of detection. Its proximity, mass and temperature have led to it being considered a good candidate to look for Jupiter-like planets. Its relatively large mass and high temperature mean that the system is relatively short-lived and hence of more recent origin.

Qu√©rcia was very critical about the economic policy during the government of Ernesto Geisel in 1977 and during this period was reported the occurrence of corruption during his period as a mayor of Campinas, but the claims were never not proven.

The pair have an angular separation of 31.4‚Ä≥ at a position angle of 126.1¬∞. They are located 15.8 light years distant from the Sun in the constellation Ursa Major. Both components are relatively dim red dwarf stars. The two stellar components of this system have a projected separation of about 152 AU, and an estimated orbital semimajor axis of 190 AU. The primary has about 48% of the Sun's mass, while the secondary is only 10%. The primary has a projected rotation velocity at the equator of less than 3 km/s; the secondary has a rotation velocity of km/s. The primary star was monitored for radial velocity (RV) variations caused by a Jupiter-mass companion in a short period orbit. It displayed no significant excess of RV variation that could be attributed to a planet. A search of the system using near-infrared speckle interferometry also failed to detect a companion orbiting at distances of 1‚Äì10 AU. Nor has a brown dwarf been detected orbiting within this system. The space velocity components of this system are U = 141, V = ‚Äì7 and W = 7. They are members of the halo population of the Milky Way galaxy. X-ray source The secondary is a flare star that is referred to as WX Ursae Majoris. It is characterized as a UV Ceti type variable star that displays infrequent increases in luminosity. This star was observed to flare as early as 1939 by the Dutch astronomer Adriaan van Maanen. Component B (WX Ursae Majoris) has been identified as an X-ray source, while no significant X-ray emission was detected from component A. This system had not been studied in X-rays prior to ROSAT. The Gaia DR2 release gives a parallax of 204.059¬±0.169 mas for B, indicating a distance of around 16 ly.

A right-hander, he stood tall and weighed . Early career LaCorte attended Gilroy High School then Gavilan College and was signed by the Braves as an undrafted free agent in 1972. He broke into the Majors late in his third professional season, and would play all or part of ten years in the MLB. Initially a starting pitcher, LaCorte hurled for the perennially struggling late-1970s Braves for the first 44 games pitched of his MLB career. He won only four of 28 decisions (.143) and compiled a poor 6.23 earned run average in 179 innings pitched during his tenure with the Braves. Effective member of Astros' bullpen On May 25, 1979, he was traded to Houston (for pitcher Bo McLaughlin) and eventually established himself with the Astros as a relief pitcher. LaCorte was a member of the National League West Division champion Astros. Along with Joe Sambito and Dave Smith, he was an integral part of the club's successful bullpen. His statistics from the 1980 season were his career best in wins (8), ERA (2.82), games pitched (55), games finished (44), and saves (11). He appeared in two games in relief in the 1980 National League Championship Series, and was the winner in Game 2's 7‚Äì4 Houston win. However, in the deciding fifth game, LaCorte gave up doubles to Del Unser and Garry Maddox in the tenth inning, as the Philadelphia Phillies broke a 7‚Äì7 deadlock to win their first National League title in 30 years.Retrosheet During a May 26, 1982, game against the Montreal Expos, LaCorte walked a batter with the bases loaded. He was so angry that he burned his uniform when he returned to the clubhouse.Conner, Floyd, \\"Baseball's Most Wanted: the Top 10 book of the national pastime's outrageous offenders, lucky bounces, and other oddities\\", Potomac Books, 2000. During his Major League career, LaCorte appeared in 253 total games ‚Äî only 32 as a starting pitcher ‚Äî and allowed 457 hits and 258 bases on balls in 490 innings pitched. He notched 372 strikeouts and 26 saves to go along with his 23 Major-League wins. He retired from professional baseball after the season. Post-baseball career Upon his retirement, LaCorte moved back to Gilroy, California, where he was raised, and purchased a tow truck business named Marx Towing.

The film's premiere in a packed Arena cinema, was followed by live sets from punk-rock bands Mitesers and Generacija bez buduƒánosti. The film is about the punk-rock scene of Serbia's second city, Novi Sad, in the first half of the 1990s. People who made up this scene talk 15 years later about the rise and reasons for the fall in interest in this kind of music, widely popular in Serbia during the rule of the late Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. As many of interviewees state, a common enemy‚ÄîMilosevic and his regime‚Äîwas a good focal point for the energy their music was making. When this enemy disappeared, the whole movement lost its edge and these days the story is very much low profile. Film was part of \\"Made in Vojvodina\\" program of 2007 Motovun Film Festival (Motovun, Croatia), presenting cinematography of Vojvodina, and also as part of four-day event‚Äî\\"Enter UK\\"‚Äîabout cultural influence of British sub-culture in Serbia, held in Novi Sad during the EXIT festival 2007. was part of the program of several festivals (Grossmann (Ljutomer, Slovenia), Filofest (Ljubljana, Slovenia), ), and had a theatrical screenings in Warsaw, Poland and Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cast and crew Most notable bands from the period are represented by their frontmen and/or other members, including Dr. Pop (Atheist Rap), Boban (Ritam nereda), Kebra (Obojeni Program), Robert and Relja (Generacija bez buduƒánosti - GBB), Vijetnamac and Marta (Zbogom Brus Li), Medan (Love Hunters), Ilija (Mitesers), Dules (Atheist Rap and Mitesers). The rest of the cast is made of people who took part in street-life during the 1990s (most of them former members of punk-rock bands)‚Äî≈†ima, ƒÜela, Nemanja, Lo≈°mi, Jens, Eriƒá, Goldi, Glava, Brle, Mird≈æa. Sava Saviƒá and Zgro are authors of the book (English: Novi Sad Punk Version) that covers the Novi Sad Punk scene from its beginnings at the end of the 1970s (the book and are often wrongly perceived as part of the same project). Gagi is a character whose name is part of the title of a popular song from the period, and Bu≈æi acts as a guide through locations where gigs were happening and where youth hung out during the 1990s. Authors used music videos by Generacija bez buduƒánosti, Obojeni Program, Ritam nereda, Atheist Rap, Zbogom Brus Li, Vrisak generacije, Boye, Love Hunters, DMT and Ska ringi≈°pil. The film was made with minimal crew‚Äîcinematographer Luƒçian Muntean and editor Zoran Nikoliƒá were the only members besides director/producer, who also acted as boom operator. Background/Production The idea for the film came to the author some months after he saw , a musical documentary about trends in Yugoslavian urban sub-culture from the beginning of 80s. In December 2004 ƒêeriƒá approached Minja Dunƒëerski, a prominent manager of rock acts and gig promoter, with the idea to make the film, and so the story starts. Dunƒëerski was credited as a co-writer, and also was a consultant and a contact for most of the people appearing in the film, as well as contributor of most of the archive materials. Filming started on July 3, 2006 on Belgrade promotion of book , continued during EXIT festival, and after pause continued from the second half of August through to mid-September 2006. A Panasonic AG-DVX100 digital camcorder was used for filming, while archive footage was down- converted from Betacam tapes. Most of the interviews were shot in progressive scan, just to be converted to interlaced, due to archive materials that were all interlaced.

The goal, when purchasing is done by the police, is to reduce the number of guns sold on the street. There are no background checks so criminals can easily buy them. A buy back program would provide a process whereby civilians can sell their privately owned firearms to the government without risk of prosecution. In most cases, the agents purchasing the guns are local police when purchasing firearms for the government. Argentina In July 2007 Argentina initiated a national gun buyback program that ran until December 2008. Participation in the program was voluntary and anonymous. Individuals received between 100 and 450 pesos (or US$30 to US$145) per firearm depending on its type. All types of firearms were accepted including legal as well as illegal weapons. The 2007-2008 buyback collected a total of 104,782 firearms or around 7% of the country's estimated total number of firearms as well as 747,000 units of ammunition. Australia There has been 28 state and territory-based amnesties since the Port Arthur massacre in April 1996. The \\"National Firearms Buyback Program\\", which ran from October 1996 through September 1997, was held for 12 months and retrieved 650,000 guns. The 2003 handgun buyback ran for 6 months and retrieved 68,727 guns. Both involved compensation paid to owners of firearms made illegal by gun law changes and surrendered to the government. Bought back firearms were destroyed. The Government increased the Medicare levy from 1.5% to 1.7% of income for one year to finance the 1996 buyback program. The program was budgeted to cost $500 million. The buyback cost $304 million in compensation and $63 million in administration. Brazil In two gun buyback programs between 2003 and 2009, the Brazilian government collected and destroyed over 1.1 million guns. In 2004, the Brazilian government implemented a six-month national gun buyback program that met its stated objective of collecting 80,000 guns in less than three months. The government budgeted $3 million for the program, in which participants were given up to $100 per gun that they handed in. Part of the 2004 buyback included strengthening gun regulations such as: making it illegal to own unregistered firearms or to carry a gun outside of one's home; raising the minimum age to own a gun to 25; and imposing new penalties on those that violate these laws. One study suggests that the buyback \\"contributed to the observed reduction in firearm related mortality.\\" United States Philadelphia tried gun buybacks in 1968, 1972 and 1974, retrieving 544 guns. Baltimore staged a 3 month buyback in 1974 offering $50 for each gun, resulting in the retrieval of 13,400 firearms, including about 8,400 handguns. Gun homicides and assaults actually rose during the two-month program, though the crime rate increased. Similar programs followed in other cities, including some cities that repeated their programs. In 1994 researchers analyzed a 1992 buyback in Seattle, Washington where 1,172 firearms were relinquished. The study found \\"Comparing firearm- related events per month before and after the program, crimes and deaths increased, and injuries decreased, but the changes were not statistically significant.\\" The study also concluded \\"effect on decreasing violent crime and reducing firearm mortality is unknown.\\" In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary, candidates Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, and Beto O'Rourke, have indicated support for gun buyback programs. =Arizona= Gun buybacks have been held in Tucson (one in 2013) and Phoenix (three in 2013). In 2013, House Bill 2455 was signed into law by Governor Jan Brewer. H.B. 2455 and Arizona Revised Statute 12-945 were enacted after lobbying by the National Rifle Association and other organizations and require that firearms seized by, surrendered to or acquired by law enforcement or other government agencies may not be destroyed. Firearms acquired through programs such as gun buybacks or seized in the course of a criminal investigation that are legal for private citizens to possess must be disposed of by sale to a federal firearms licensed dealer. These statutes have raised controversy, with opponents charging that the statutes will turn gun buybacks into recycling programs. Proponents of the measures point out that firearms purchased through private buyback programs may be destroyed. =California= On December 15, 2012, the day after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, an anonymous donor funded gun buyback events in Oakland and San Francisco, California. Hundreds of area residents received $200 cash for each firearm sold, \\"no questions asked.\\" The guns were to be destroyed. A mile-long line of cars lined up into the East Oakland church parking lot that served as that community's exchange location, prompting the private donor to double his contribution. Over 600 guns were bought between the two locations. One week later, it was learned that the event was largely funded by a medical marijuana dispensary, whose executive director said, \\"It's part of the philosophy we practice called capitalism with a conscience.\\" Started in 2009, an ongoing anonymous buyback program in Los Angeles offers retail gift cards in exchange for guns. =Maryland= For two months in 1974, the Baltimore Police Department ran what is believed to have been the first gun buyback program in the U.S. Police commissioner Donald Pomerleau, not known as an advocate for strict gun control, reportedly came up with the idea while at a funeral for an officer who was shot in the line of duty. Operation PASS (People Against Senseless Shootings) paid a $50 \\"bounty\\" for surrendered guns and $100 for tips leading to the confiscation of illegal guns. Some bounty seekers attempted to game the system by buying cheap, new guns that retailed for $21.95 and then trying to turn them in. In all, the police collected 13,500 firearms - mostly handguns - at a cost of over $660,000. However, the city's already high gun homicide and assault rates actually increased during the program, for which police officials offered no explanation. =Massachusetts= From July 12‚Äì14, 2006, the Boston Police Department, with support from dozens of community and faith-based organizations, collected 1,000 firearms. Residents received $200 Target gift cards in exchange for their guns. =Michigan= At an August 2012 buyback, the Detroit Police Department paid $16,820 for 365 guns, including six assault weapons and a few sawed-off shotguns. The guns were accepted \\"no questions asked\\" at a church where members had collected $18,000 to help get dangerous weapons off the street. People could receive from $50 to $100 for unloaded, operational weapons. Gun-carrying protesters offered to purchase the firearms from those in line for more money than the police were offering. =New Jersey= A buyback in Camden, New Jersey, in December 2012 collected 1,137 firearms. In April 2013, Newark Police Department collected more than 200 firearms during a buyback funded by Jewelry for a Cause. This was the first buyback in the city's history to be completely funded through private sources. Such programs allow residents to turn in guns for cash. In January 2014, Newark police director Samuel DeMaio said he was reviewing the implementation of an ongoing program instead of once or twice a year. Gun buybacks in several locations in Essex County, New Jersey, including Newark, collected about 1,700 guns in February 2013. = Washington = The city of Seattle has experimented with Gun Buy Back Programs since the early 1990s. Seattle's 1992 gun buyback was initiated in response to a string of shootings in a local neighborhood. The buyback program was watched with great interest given the local demographic and the generally positive public support for the buyback from residents of Seattle and the surrounding area. A public health survey titled \\"Money for Guns\\" was conducted and while it concluded that no statistically significant result was produced on Seattle's gun crime or gun death ratio, the report maintained that a larger buyback program would be sure to yield positive results. Over 20 years later Seattle would again make headline for its bold gun buyback program in 2013, but perhaps not for the reasons the programs sponsors and organizers would have liked. While the program, could be considered a success, collecting more than 700 guns, handing out almost $70,000 in gift cards and even netting a Stinger missile launcher tube (minus the missile), the program also had a widely unanticipated effect from the local gun buying community. Hundreds of gun buyers showed up to the event seeking to offer cash for valuable antiques or functioning second hand firearms. The lack of any need for background check in transactions involving private firearms sales turned the city sponsored event into an open air gun bazaar. Since then other cities have experienced similar situations, including private sales and/or local gun owners taking advantage of lucrative gift card offers to unload rusted or non-functioning firearms onto the police. New Zealand New Zealand introduced a new bill in March 2019 as an amendment to existing legislation with the aim of tightening gun control to increase the safety and security of New Zealanders by reducing the risk of death or injury from guns. This bill was introduced following the Christchurch mosque shootings along with a government funded Gun Buy Back program in which compensation would be paid to owners of firearms made illegal by gun law changes and subsequently surrendered. New Zealand Police reported approx 47,000 firearms were collected.

In his final start on June 3, he fired a baseball at manager Roy Hartsfield when Hartsfield came to remove him from the game. Lemongello continued making occasional relief appearances until late July, when he was sent down to the minors after a screaming match with Hartsfield. When informed he was being sent down to the Syracuse Chiefs, he threw an ashtray at the head of Blue Jays general manager Peter Bavasi, barely missing him. Lemongello never appeared in another major league game. Sold to the Chicago Cubs in 1980, his playing career ended that same year with the Triple-A Wichita Aeros. In 1982, a few years after leaving baseball, Lemongello and Manuel Seoane, a former Wichita teammate, were arrested for the kidnapping and robbery of Lemongello's cousins Mike Lemongello, a former professional bowler, and Peter Lemongello. Lemongello was sentenced to seven years probation after he pleaded no contest to the charges. By 1989, he was living in Phoenix, Arizona, working for Coca- Cola.Howarth, Jerry.

The film was directed by John Ford and stars Spencer Tracy as a veteran mayor preparing for yet another election campaign. Tracy was nominated as Best Foreign Actor by BAFTA and won the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review, which also presented Ford the award for Best Director. The film tells the story of Frank Skeffington, a sentimental but iron-fisted Irish-American who is the powerful mayor of an unnamed New England city. As his nephew, Adam Caulfield, follows one last no-holds-barred mayoral campaign, Skeffington and his top strategist, John Gorman, use whatever means necessary to defeat a candidate backed by civic leaders such as banker Norman Cass and newspaper editor Amos Force, the mayor's dedicated foes. Plot The titles roll as an election campaign for a Frank Skeffington unfold. In \\"a New England city\\", Frank Skeffington (Spencer Tracy) plans to run for a fifth term. Skeffington rose from poverty in an Irish ghetto to become mayor and former governor, and is skilled at using the power of his office and an enormous political machine of ward heelers to receive support from his Irish Catholic base and other demographics. Rumors of graft and abuse of power are widespread, however, and the Protestant bishop Gardner (Basil Ruysdael), newspaper publisher Amos Force (John Carradine), banker Norman Cass (Basil Rathbone), and other members of the city's traditional elite the Irish Catholics replaced oppose Skeffington; so do the Catholic cardinal Martin Burke (Donald Crisp), Skeffington's childhood friend, and other Catholics. Skeffington's opponents support the candidacy of Kevin McCluskey (Charles B. Fitzsimons), a young Catholic lawyer and war veteran with no political experience. Adam Caulfield (Jeffrey Hunter) is a sportswriter for Force's newspaper and Skeffington's nephew. His father-in-law, Roger Sugrue (Willis Bouchey), is among those who oppose Skeffington, even though Sugrue grew up in the same tenement as Skeffington and Burke. The mayor invites Caulfield to observe in person what will be his last election, his \\"last hurrah\\", to document urban politics before radio and television fully change campaigning. Skeffington prefers old-fashioned, hands-on politics, and attends numerous rallies, luncheons, dinners, and speeches. His influence is such that when Skeffington attends an unpopular old friend's wake, hundreds rush to be present. Disgusted at how the wake becomes another political event, Caulfield leaves; one of the mayor's men explains to him, however, that Skeffington attended to attract mourners to cheer the widow, to whom Skeffington has secretly donated $1,000. After Cass's bank turns down a loan for the city to build a housing development, Skeffington invades the exclusive Plymouth Club to confront him, Force, the bishop, and other members of the elite. The mayor threatens to publicly embarrass Cass's family by appointing his unintelligent son as fire commissioner. The banker is forced to approve the loan, but vows to contribute large amounts of money to defeat Skeffington. McCluskey's campaign arranges for a series of television advertisements, but his ineptness disappoints both the cardinal and bishop. On election night Skeffington's men expect another victory, but McCluskey unexpectedly defeats the incumbent and his machine. As his men argue over why their usual tactics involving large amounts of \\"money\\" failed, Skeffington chastises them as if he were unaware of their actions. The mayor confidently states on television that he will run for governor but suffers a heart attack that night, and a large crowd comes to pay respect to the invalid. After Skeffington's last confession, the cardinal, Caulfield, Sugrue, and the mayor's men are at his bedside. When Sugrue suggests that the patient would relive his life differently, Skeffington regains consciousness enough to reply \\"Like Hell I would\\" before dying.

The role of Mayor Frank Skeffington was first offered to Orson Welles, as Welles recounts in Peter Bogdanovich's 1992 book This Is Orson Welles: > When the contracts were to be settled, I was away on location, and some > lawyer -- if you can conceive of such a thing -- turned it down. He told > Ford that the money wasn't right or the billing wasn't good enough, > something idiotic like that, and when I came back to town the part had gone > to Tracy. Production Like the novel, the film was based in part on the career of former Boston mayor James Michael Curley, and the unnamed New England city that he runs was based on Boston, Massachusetts. Curley opposed the film's production, but not because of the negative dramatization; rather, he believed that The Last Hurrah might prevent Hollywood from making a biographical film of his life.As stated by Robert Osborne in his introduction of The Last Hurrah on Turner Classic Movies, 14 January 2012. Columbia paid Curley $25,000 in exchange for signing away any future legal action. The movie was budgeted at $2.5 million but came in at $200,000 under budget. For The Last Hurrah a large, expensive New England exterior set was constructed around an existing park at Columbia Ranch in Burbank, CA. Most of this 'Boston Row homes' set burned down in 1974, but the 'Skeffington Mansion' still stands, and can be seen in many TV shows and movies. Part of the structures behind the Park can be seen in the opening credits for the series Friends. Reception The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called it \\"robustly amusing and deeply touching. And Mr. Tracy is at his best in the leading role.\\" Variety wrote, \\"The two-hour running length is somewhat overboard but Tracy's characterization of the resourceful, old- line politician-mayor has such consummate depth that it sustains the interest practically all the way. A little editing might have helped but the canvas is rich and the political machinations replete.\\" Harrison's Reports called the film \\"a vastly entertaining study of a resourceful old-time politician, wonderfully portrayed by Spencer Tracy, who makes the character warmly human, sympathetic, witty and charming even though he is not above resorting to trickery and malice to combat political enemies.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote \\"There are some sprightly moments in this film...but as a really sound representation of political shenanigans it is a long way from home. (While Skeffington was going about spreading sweetness and light, I kept thinking nostalgically about the film called The Great McGinty; now there was an elucidation of American politics.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post praised Spencer Tracy's performance as \\"deep and alert\\" but still found the film disappointing, writing that it \\"isn't exactly bad, but it's nowhere near the movie Edwin O'Connor's hard, rollicking political novel should have made...Very rarely does Hollywood risk meeting politics head-on and this shows clearly in Frank Nugent's fairly empty, very sentimental screen treatment of O'Connor's vigorous book.\\" A positive review in the British Monthly Film Bulletin commented that it was \\"directed with humour, feeling (notably in the relationships between Skeffington and his supporters, the clownish Ditto and the shrewd ward politicians) and a superlative sense of the big occasion. The election scene, moving from bustling confidence to cold defeat, is masterly; the death-bed scene is a triumphant piece of old-style sentiment. Tracy's Skeffington suggests the real power that lies beneath the Irish charm and effrontery.\\" The movie was not a box-office success and recorded a loss of $1.8 million. Tracy was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his work in The Old Man and the Sea released earlier that year, but believed his performance in The Last Hurrah was superior. Ronald Bergan believed that the movie was perhaps Ford's \\"most personal\\" film among his later works. He stated that Tracy's portrayal of Skeffington was a surrogate for Ford and that the film was \\"full of Fordian moments.\\" See also * List of American films of 1958 References External links  * Category:1958 films Category:1950s political drama films Category:American films Category:American political drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films about elections Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by John Ford Category:Films set in Massachusetts Category:1958 drama films ","title":"The Last Hurrah (1958 film)"},{"id":"11825928","text":"Victor Charles Hanot Victor Charles Hanot (6 July 1844 ‚Äì 28 October 1896) was a French physician remembered for his work in the field of hepatology. He earned his medical doctorate in 1875, and was associated with the H√¥pital Saint-Antoine in Paris. He was professor agr√©g√© of general medicine, and editor-in-chief of the Archives generale de m√©decine. Hanot was considered to be a major influence in the career of Augustin Nicolas Gilbert (1858‚Äì1927). Hanot specialized in the study of liver diseases, making contributions in his research of cirrhosis and hemochromatosis. He provided a description of primary biliary cirrhosis, a disease sometimes referred to as \\"Hanot's disease\\". Among his written works was a study on hypertrophic cirrhosis titled Etude sur une forme de cirrhose hypertrophique du foie (cirrhose hypertrophique avec ict√®re chronique), (1875). He is associated with the eponymous \\"Troisier-Hanot-Chauffard syndrome\\", characterized as hypertrophic cirrhosis with skin pigmentation and diabetes mellitus.

A ballast cleaner (also known as an undercutter, a shoulder ballast cleaning machine) is a machine that specialises in cleaning the railway track ballast (gravel, blue stone or other aggregate) of impurities.  Background and development  Over time, ballast becomes worn, and loses its angularity, becoming rounded. This hinders the tessellation of pieces of ballast with one another, and thus reduces its effectiveness. Fine pieces of granite, like sand, are also created by attrition, known simply as \\"fines\\". Combined with water in the ballast, these fines stick together, making the ballast like a lump of concrete. This hinders both track drainage and the flexibility of the ballast to constrain the track as it moves under traffic. Ballast cleaning removes this worn ballast, screens it and replaces the \\"dirty\\" worn ballast with fresh ballast. The advantage of ballast cleaning is that it can be done by an on-track machine without removing the rail and sleepers, and it is therefore cheaper than a total excavation. In the 19th century and early 20th century, ballast was shoveled or forked, then screened by hand using portable devices. Early automated cleaners used vacuum pressure built by a steam locomotive to suck ballast up from the track to feed it into the sifting grates. Link-Belt produced a small machine that would clean the ballast between tracks on a multiple track line; it used a small gasoline engine and was small enough to be operated by a small crew of men, and it was built such that it would not need to be moved as trains passed on adjacent tracks. More fully automated ballast cleaners were developed in the early- to mid-20th century by several companies including Speno and Pullman-Standard; a version of Pullman- Standard's machine was demonstrated in 1949 that was estimated to save railroad companies about $1,000 per mile of track on their maintenance. As the century progressed, other manufacturers entered the market with their own versions.  Modern ballast cleaner operations  Closeup of the undercutting bar and results on a Plasser & Theurer ballast cleaner in use in Hungary in 2009 A cutter bar runs beneath sleeper level excavating all of the ballast under the sleepers to a specified, variable depth. A conveyor then moves the ballast into the cleaner, where it gets forced through a mesh by a shaking chamber. Pieces of ballast which are smaller than the mesh size fall through and are rejected, those that are bigger than the mesh are returned to the track along with fresh ballast. Some ballast cleaners have both ballast and spoil wagons attached to it, to which the materials are fed by a series of conveyor belts. Others simply undercut the ballast, and allow for a work train to come through to dump fresh ballast. This process can be done in short sections, meaning that track life can be considerably extended with the minimum of disruption.

They are functions that appear in most proofs in this area of mathematics and that have specific, desirable properties, such as taking the value zero for many arguments, or having a zero of high order at some point.Waldschmidt (2008). Definition Auxiliary functions are not a rigorously defined kind of function, rather they are functions which are either explicitly constructed or at least shown to exist and which provide a contradiction to some assumed hypothesis, or otherwise prove the result in question. Creating a function during the course of a proof in order to prove the result is not a technique exclusive to transcendence theory, but the term \\"auxiliary function\\" usually refers to the functions created in this area. Explicit functions =Liouville's transcendence criterion= Because of the naming convention mentioned above, auxiliary functions can be dated back to their source simply by looking at the earliest results in transcendence theory. One of these first results was Liouville's proof that transcendental numbers exist when he showed that the so called Liouville numbers were transcendental.Liouville (1844). He did this by discovering a transcendence criterion which these numbers satisfied. To derive this criterion he started with a general algebraic number Œ± and found some property that this number would necessarily satisfy. The auxiliary function he used in the course of proving this criterion was simply the minimal polynomial of Œ±, which is the irreducible polynomial f with integer coefficients such that f(Œ±) = 0\\\\. This function can be used to estimate how well the algebraic number Œ± can be estimated by rational numbers p/q. Specifically if Œ± has degree d at least two then he showed that :\\\\leftf\\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\geq\\\\frac{1}{q^d}, and also, using the mean value theorem, that there is some constant depending on Œ±, say c(Œ±), such that :\\\\leftf\\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right)\\\\right \\\\leq c(\\\\alpha)\\\\left\\\\alpha-\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right. Combining these results gives a property that the algebraic number must satisfy; therefore any number not satisfying this criterion must be transcendental. The auxiliary function in Liouville's work is very simple, merely a polynomial that vanishes at a given algebraic number. This kind of property is usually the one that auxiliary functions satisfy. They either vanish or become very small at particular points, which is usually combined with the assumption that they do not vanish or can't be too small to derive a result. =Fourier's proof of the irrationality of e= Another simple, early occurrence is in Fourier's proof of the irrationality of e,Hermite (1873). though the notation used usually disguises this fact. Fourier's proof used the power series of the exponential function: :e^x=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{x^n}{n!}. By truncating this power series after, say, N + 1 terms we get a polynomial with rational coefficients of degree N which is in some sense \\"close\\" to the function ex. Specifically if we look at the auxiliary function defined by the remainder: :R(x)=e^x-\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\\\frac{x^n}{n!} then this function‚Äîan exponential polynomial‚Äîshould take small values for x close to zero. If e is a rational number then by letting x = 1 in the above formula we see that R(1) is also a rational number. However, Fourier proved that R(1) could not be rational by eliminating every possible denominator. Thus e cannot be rational. =Hermite's proof of the irrationality of er= Hermite extended the work of Fourier by approximating the function ex not with a polynomial but with a rational function, that is a quotient of two polynomials. In particular he chose polynomials A(x) and B(x) such that the auxiliary function R defined by :R(x)=B(x)e^x-A(x) could be made as small as he wanted around x = 0\\\\. But if er were rational then R(r) would have to be rational with a particular denominator, yet Hermite could make R(r) too small to have such a denominator, hence a contradiction. =Hermite's proof of the transcendence of e= To prove that e was in fact transcendental, Hermite took his work one step further by approximating not just the function ex, but also the functions ekx for integers k = 1,...,m, where he assumed e was algebraic with degree m. By approximating ekx by rational functions with integer coefficients and with the same denominator, say Ak(x) / B(x), he could define auxiliary functions Rk(x) by :R_k(x)=B(x)e^{kx}-A_k(x). For his contradiction Hermite supposed that e satisfied the polynomial equation with integer coefficients a0 + a1e + ... + amem = 0\\\\. Multiplying this expression through by B(1) he noticed that it implied :R=a_0+a_1 R_1(1) + \\\\cdots +a_m R_m(1)=a_1 A_1(1)+ \\\\cdots +a_m A_m(1). The right hand side is an integer and so, by estimating the auxiliary functions and proving that 0 < R < 1 he derived the necessary contradiction. Auxiliary functions from the pigeonhole principle The auxiliary functions sketched above can all be explicitly calculated and worked with. A breakthrough by Axel Thue and Carl Ludwig Siegel in the twentieth century was the realisation that these functions don't necessarily need to be explicitly known - it can be enough to know they exist and have certain properties. Using the Pigeonhole Principle Thue, and later Siegel, managed to prove the existence of auxiliary functions which, for example, took the value zero at many different points, or took high order zeros at a smaller collection of points. Moreover they proved it was possible to construct such functions without making the functions too large.Thue (1977) and Siegel (1929). Their auxiliary functions were not explicit functions, then, but by knowing that a certain function with certain properties existed, they used its properties to simplify the transcendence proofs of the nineteenth century and give several new results.Siegel (1932). This method was picked up on and used by several other mathematicians, including Alexander Gelfond and Theodor Schneider who used it independently to prove the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem.Gel'fond (1934) and Schneider (1934). Alan Baker also used the method in the 1960s for his work on linear forms in logarithms and ultimately Baker's theorem.Baker and W√ºstholz (2007). Another example of the use of this method from the 1960s is outlined below. =Auxiliary polynomial theorem= Let Œ≤ equal the cube root of b/a in the equation ax3 \\\\+ bx3 = c and assume m is an integer that satisfies m + 1 > 2n/3 ‚â• m ‚â• 3 where n is a positive integer. Then there exists : F(X,Y) = P(X) + Y*Q(X) such that : \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m+n} u_i X^i = P(X), : \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m+n} v_i X^i = Q(X). The auxiliary polynomial theorem states : \\\\max_{0 \\\\le i \\\\le m+n} {(u_i,v_i)}\\\\le 2b^{9(m+n)}. =A theorem of Lang= In the 1960s Serge Lang proved a result using this non-explicit form of auxiliary functions. The theorem implies both the Hermite‚ÄìLindemann and Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorems.Lang (1966). The theorem deals with a number field K and meromorphic functions f1,...,fN of order at most œÅ, at least two of which are algebraically independent, and such that if we differentiate any of these functions then the result is a polynomial in all of the functions. Under these hypotheses the theorem states that if there are m distinct complex numbers œâ1,...,œâm such that fi (œâj ) is in K for all combinations of i and j, then m is bounded by :m\\\\leq 20\\\\rho [K:\\\\mathbb{Q}]. To prove the result Lang took two algebraically independent functions from f1,...,fN, say f and g, and then created an auxiliary function which was simply a polynomial F in f and g. This auxiliary function could not be explicitly stated since f and g are not explicitly known. But using Siegel's lemma Lang showed how to make F in such a way that it vanished to a high order at the m complex numbers œâ1,...,œâm. Because of this high order vanishing it can be shown that a high-order derivative of F takes a value of small size one of the œâis, \\"size\\" here referring to an algebraic property of a number. Using the maximum modulus principle Lang also found a separate way to estimate the absolute values of derivatives of F, and using standard results comparing the size of a number and its absolute value he showed that these estimates were contradicted unless the claimed bound on m holds. Interpolation determinants After the myriad of successes gleaned from using existent but not explicit auxiliary functions, in the 1990s Michel Laurent introduced the idea of interpolation determinants.Laurent (1991). These are alternants - determinants of matrices of the form :\\\\mathcal{M}=\\\\left(\\\\varphi_i(\\\\zeta_j)\\\\right)_{1\\\\leq i,j\\\\leq N} where œÜi are a set of functions interpolated at a set of points Œ∂j. Since a determinant is just a polynomial in the entries of a matrix, these auxiliary functions succumb to study by analytic means. A problem with the method was the need to choose a basis before the matrix could be worked with. A development by Jean-Beno√Æt Bost removed this problem with the use of Arakelov theory,Bost (1996). and research in this area is ongoing. The example below gives an idea of the flavour of this approach. =A proof of the Hermite‚ÄìLindemann theorem= One of the simpler applications of this method is a proof of the real version of the Hermite‚ÄìLindemann theorem. That is, if Œ± is a non-zero, real algebraic number, then eŒ± is transcendental. First we let k be some natural number and n be a large multiple of k. The interpolation determinant considered is the determinant Œî of the n4√ón4 matrix :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\{\\\\exp(j_2x)x^{j_1-1}\\\\\\\\}^{(i_1-1)}\\\\Big_{x=(i_2-1)\\\\alpha}\\\\right). The rows of this matrix are indexed by 1 ‚â§ i1 ‚â§ n4/k and 1 ‚â§ i2 ‚â§ k, while the columns are indexed by 1 ‚â§ j1 ‚â§ n3 and 1 ‚â§ j2 ‚â§ n. So the functions in our matrix are monomials in x and ex and their derivatives, and we are interpolating at the k points 0,Œ±,2Œ±,...,(k ‚àí 1)Œ±. Assuming that eŒ± is algebraic we can form the number field Q(Œ±,eŒ±) of degree m over Q, and then multiply Œî by a suitable denominator as well as all its images under the embeddings of the field Q(Œ±,eŒ±) into C. For algebraic reasons this product is necessarily an integer, and using arguments relating to Wronskians it can be shown that it is non-zero, so its absolute value is an integer Œ© ‚â• 1\\\\. Using a version of the mean value theorem for matrices it is possible to get an analytic bound on Œ© as well, and in fact using big-O notation we have :\\\\Omega=O\\\\left(\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\frac{m+1}{k}-\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\right)n^8\\\\log n\\\\right)\\\\right). The number m is fixed by the degree of the field Q(Œ±,eŒ±), but k is the number of points we are interpolating at, and so we can increase it at will. And once k > 2(m + 1)/3 we will have Œ© ‚Üí 0, eventually contradicting the established condition Œ© ‚â• 1\\\\. Thus eŒ± cannot be algebraic after all.Adapted from Pila (1993).

Among his siblings were brothers Lewis Morris, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Richard Morris, a New York judge, and half-brother Gouverneur Morris, an author of the United States Constitution. He was a grandson of the first colonial governor of New Jersey Lewis Morris and Isabella (n√©e Graham) Morris (a daughter of Speaker James Graham). His paternal uncle was Robert Hunter Morris, the Deputy governor of New Jersey. His maternal grandfather was New York surgeon, Dr. Samuel Staats. He studied at Yale College. Career On 31 May 1756, he joined the British army, and became captain of the 36th Regiment of Foot. He was quickly promoted lieutenant-colonel in the 89th (Highland) Regiment of Foot, with which he served at the siege of the French colony of Pondicherry, India in 1761. On 7 July 1763, he was made brigadier-general and in 1777 was promoted major- general. In 1778 he was appointed Colonel of the 61st Foot for life and on 3 May 1796 made a full general. He was appointed to succeed James Johnston as governor of the garrison at Quebec in 1797, holding the office until his death. In 1769, he took out a patent of some 30,000 acres, at Butternuts Creek, near Otsego Lake (New York), and developed a settlement. In 1785, the patent was reassigned to Lewis Morris, and Richard Morris. He inherited Morrisania, which he sold to Gouverneur Morris in 1787. On 1 June 1769, he purchased 967.37 acres, for ¬£2,902 near Morristown, New Jersey. On 28 August 1790, he sold land in New Jersey to John Ramsey, John Dickson, and Thomas Coyle. Morris became a member of the British Parliament, representing Elgin Burghs from 1774 to 1784. Personal life In March 1756, Morris married the widowed Lady Catherine Gordon (1718‚Äì1779), a daughter of William Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aberdeen and Lady Susan Murray (a daughter of John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl). Lady Catherine was the Dowager Duchess of Gordon after the death of her first husband Cosmo Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon in August 1752. Among her children from her first marriage were Alexander, 4th Duke of Gordon, Lord William Gordon, and Lord George Gordon. Lady Catherine died on 10 December 1779. Around December 1780, he remarried to Jane Urquhart (1749‚Äì1801), a daughter of Capt. John Urquhart of Craigston and Joanna (n√©e Urquhart) Urquhart. Her older sister, Mary Urquhart, was the wife of Robert Arbuthnot of Haddo and the mother of Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet and Elizabeth Arbuthnot (wife of Consul-General John Hunter). He died in Quebec, Canada on 28 January 1800, aged 71. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the nave of Westminster Abbey in 1800. His widow died the following year on 15 March 1801.

Changes in English at the time Early Modern English as a literary medium was unfixed in structure and vocabulary in comparison to Greek, Hebrew and Latin, and was in a constant state of flux. When William Shakespeare began writing his plays, the English language was rapidly absorbing words from other languages due to wars, exploration, diplomacy and colonization. By the age of Elizabeth, English had become widely used with the expansion of philosophy, theology and physical sciences, but many writers lacked the vocabulary to express such ideas. To accommodate this, writers such as Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare expressed new ideas and distinctions by inventing, borrowing or adopting a word or a phrase from another language, known as neologising. Scholars estimate that, between the years 1500 and 2018, nouns, verbs and modifiers of Latin, Greek and modern Romance languages added 30,000 new words to the English language. Influence on theatre Shakespeare's works have been a major influence on subsequent theatre. He developed theatre to an amazing extent and changed the way theatre is today. Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature (with Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world's greatest plays),Brown, Calvin Smith; Harrison, Robert L.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre (previous to Shakespeare, romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy).Levenson, Jill L. \\"Introduction\\" to Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 49‚Äì50. In her discussion about gamma the play's genre, Levenson quotes scholar H.B. Charlton Romeo and Juliet creating a new genre of \\"romantic tragedy.\\" Through his soliloquies, Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character's inner motivations and conflict (up until Shakespeare, soliloquies were often used by playwrights to \\"introduce [characters], convey information, provide an exposition or reveal plans\\").Clemen, Wolfgang H., Shakespeare's Soliloquies Routledge, 1987, p. 179. =Characters= His plays exhibited \\"spectacular violence, with loose and episodic plotting, and with a mingling of comedy with tragedy\\". In King Lear, Shakespeare had deliberately brought together two plots of different origins. Shakespeare's work is also lauded for its insight into emotion. His themes regarding the human condition make him more acclaimed than any of his contemporaries. Humanism and contact with popular thinking gave vitality to his language. Shakespeare's plays borrowed ideas from popular sources, folk traditions, street pamphlets, and sermons. Shakespeare also used groundlings widely in his plays. The use of groundlings \\"saved the drama from academic stiffness and preserved its essential bias towards entertainment in comedy\\". Hamlet is an outstanding example of \\"groundlings\\" quickness and response. Use of groundlings enhanced Shakespeare's work practically and artistically. He represented English people more concretely and not as puppets. His skills have found expression in chronicles, or history plays, and tragedies. Shakespeare's earliest years were dominated by history plays and a few comedies that formed a link to the later written tragedies. Nine out of eighteen plays he produced in the first decade of his career were chronicles or histories. His histories were based on the prevailing Tudor political thought. They portrayed the follies and achievements of kings, their misgovernment, church and problems arising out of these. \\"In shaping, compressing, and altering chronicles, Shakespeare gained the art of dramatic design; and in the same way he developed his remarkable insight into character, its continuity and its variation\\". His characters were very near to reality. \\"Shakespeare's characters are more sharply individualized after Love's Labour's Lost\\". His Richard II and Bolingbroke are complex and solid figures whereas Richard III has more \\"humanity and comic gusto\\". The Falstaff trilogy is in this respect very important. Falstaff, although a minor character, has a powerful reality of his own. \\"Shakespeare uses him as a commentator who passes judgments on events represented in the play, in the light of his own superabundant comic vitality\\". Falstaff, although outside \\"the prevailing political spirit of the play\\", throws insight into the different situations arising in the play. This shows that Shakespeare had developed a capacity to see the plays as whole, something more than characters and expressions added together. In the Falstaff trilogy, through the character of Falstaff, he wants to show that in society \\"where touchstone of conduct is a success, and in which humanity has to accommodate itself to the claims of expediency, there is no place for Falstaff\\", a loyal human being. Shakespeare united the three main streams of literature: verse, poetry, and drama. To the versification of the English language, he imparted his eloquence and variety giving highest expressions with elasticity of language. The second, the sonnets and poetry, was bound in structure. He imparted economy and intensity to the language. In the third and the most important area, the drama, he saved the language from vagueness and vastness and infused actuality and vividness. Shakespeare's work in prose, poetry, and drama marked the beginning of the modernization of English language by introduction of words and expressions, style and form to the language.  Influence on European and American literature  Shakespeare influenced many writers in the following centuries, including major novelists such as Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Thomas HardyMillgate, Michael and Wilson, Keith, Thomas Hardy Reappraised: Essays in Honour of Michael Millgate University of Toronto Press, 2006, 38. and William Faulkner. Examples of this influence include the large number of Shakespearean quotations throughout Dickens' writings and the fact that at least 25 of Dickens' titles are drawn from Shakespeare, while Melville frequently used Shakespearean devices, including formal stage directions and extended soliloquies, in Moby-Dick.Bryant, John. \\"Moby Dick as Revolution\\" The Cambridge Companion to Herman Melville Robert Steven Levine (editor). Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 82. In fact, Shakespeare so influenced Melville that the novel's main antagonist, Captain Ahab, is a classic Shakespearean tragic figure, \\"a great man brought down by his faults.\\" Shakespeare has also influenced a number of English poets, especially Romantic poets such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge who were obsessed with self- consciousness, a modern theme Shakespeare anticipated in plays such as Hamlet. Shakespeare's writings were so influential to English poetry of the 1800s that critic George Steiner has called all English poetic dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson \\"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\\" Influence on the English language  Shakespeare's writings greatly influenced the entire English language. Prior to and during Shakespeare's time, the grammar and rules of English were not standardized.Introduction to Hamlet by William Shakespeare, Barron's Educational Series, 2002, p. 12. But once Shakespeare's plays became popular in the late seventeenth and eighteenth century, they helped contribute to the standardization of the English language, with many Shakespearean words and phrases becoming embedded in the English language, particularly through projects such as Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language which quoted Shakespeare more than any other writer.Lynch, Jack. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary: Selections from the 1755 Work that Defined the English Language. Delray Beach, FL: Levenger Press (2002), p. 12. He expanded the scope of English literature by introducing new words and phrases,Mabillard, Amanda. Why Study Shakespeare? Shakespeare Online. 20 Aug 2000.< http://www.shakespeare-online.com/biography/whystudyshakespeare.html >. experimenting with blank verse, and also introducing new poetic and grammatical structures. He also inspired modern terms commonly used in the twenty-first century, such as the word \\"swag\\", which derives from \\"swagger\\", first seen in the text of his plays Henry V and A Midsummer Night's Dream. =Vocabulary= Among Shakespeare's greatest contributions to the English language must be the introduction of new vocabulary and phrases which have enriched the language making it more colourful and expressive. Some estimates at the number of words coined by Shakespeare number in the several thousands. Warren King clarifies by saying that, \\"In all of his work ‚Äì the plays, the sonnets and the narrative poems ‚Äì Shakespeare uses 17,677 words: Of those, 1,700 were first used by Shakespeare.\\" He is also well known for borrowing from the classical literature and foreign languages. He created these words by \\"changing nouns into verbs, changing verbs into adjectives, connecting words never before used together, adding prefixes and suffixes, and devising words wholly original.\\" Many of Shakespeare's original phrases are still used in conversation and language today. These include, but are not limited to; \\"seen better days, strange bedfellows, a sorry sight,\\" and \\"full circle\\". Shakespeare added a considerable number of words to the English language when compared to additions to English vocabulary made in other times. Shakespeare helped to further develop style and structure to an otherwise loose, spontaneous language. Written Elizabethan English stylistically closely followed the spoken language. The naturalness gave force and freedom since there was no formalized prescriptive grammar binding the expression. While lack of prescribed grammatical rules introduced vagueness in literature, it also expressed feelings with profound vividness and emotion which created, \\"freedom of expression\\" and \\"vividness of presentment\\". It was a language which expressed feelings explicitly. Shakespeare's gift involved using the exuberance of the language and decasyllabic structure in prose and poetry of his plays to reach the masses and the result was \\"a constant two way exchange between learned and the popular, together producing the unique combination of racy tang and the majestic stateliness that informs the language of Shakespeare\\". While it is true that Shakespeare created many new words (the Oxford English Dictionary records over 2,000Jucker, Andreas H. History of English and English Historical Linguistics. Stuttgart: Ernst Klett Verlag (2000), p. 51.), an article in National Geographic points out the findings of historian Jonathan Hope who wrote in \\"Shakespeare's 'Native English'\\" that \\"the Victorian scholars who read texts for the first edition of the OED paid special attention to Shakespeare: his texts were read more thoroughly and cited more often, so he is often credited with the first use of words, or senses of words, which can, in fact, be found in other writers.\\" =Blank verse= Many critics and scholars consider Shakespeare's first plays experimental and believe the playwright was still learning from his own mistakes. Gradually his language followed the \\"natural process of artistic growth, to find its adequate projection in dramatic form\\". As he continued experimenting, his style of writing found many manifestations in plays. The dialogues in his plays were written in verse form and followed a decasyllabic rule. In Titus Andronicus, decasyllables have been used throughout. \\"There is a considerable pause; and though the inflexibility of the line sound is little affected by it, there is a certain running over of sense\\". His work is still experimental in Titus Andronicus. However, in Love's Labour's Lost and The Comedy of Errors, there is \\"perfect metre-abundance of rime [rhyme], plenty of prose, arrangement in stanza\\". After these two comedies, he kept experimenting until he reached a maturity of style. \\"Shakespeare's experimental use of trend and style, as well as the achieved development of his blank verses, are all evidence of his creative invention and influences\\". Through experimentation of tri-syllabic substitution and decasyllabic rule he developed the blank verse to perfection and introduced a new style. \\"Shakespeare's blank verse is one of the most important of all his influences on the way the English language was written\\". He used the blank verse throughout in his writing career experimenting and perfecting it. The free speech rhythm gave Shakespeare more freedom for experimentation. \\"Adaptation of free speech rhythm to the fixed blank-verse framework is an outstanding feature of Shakespeare's poetry\\". The striking choice of words in common place blank verse influenced \\"the run of the verse itself, expanding into images which eventually seem to bear significant repetition, and to form, with the presentation of character and action correspondingly developed, a more subtle and suggestive unity\\". Expressing emotions and situations in form of a verse gave a natural flow to language with an added sense of flexibility and spontaneity. =Poetry= He introduced in poetry two main factors ‚Äì \\"verbal immediacy and the moulding of stress to the movement of living emotion\\". Shakespeare's words reflected the passage of time with \\"fresh, concrete vividness\\" giving the reader an idea of the time frame. His remarkable capacity to analyze and express emotions in simple words was noteworthy: In the sonnet above, he has expressed in very simple words \\"complex and even contradictory attitudes to a single emotion\\". The sonnet form was limited structurally, in theme and in expressions. The liveliness of Shakespeare's language and strict discipline of the sonnets imparted economy and intensity to his writing style. \\"It encouraged the association of compression with a depth of content and variety of emotional response to a degree unparalleled in English\\". Complex human emotions found simple expressions in Shakespeare's language.

It is both the world's largest Chinese grassroots news and photography website and the first Chinese citizen journalism website. In addition to being a photograph sharing website, the service is also used by bloggers as a photo archive. Moobol currently has more 100,000 photos from 30,000 users mostly from mainland China and Southeast Asia. Moobol is a subsidiary of China Daily.  Naming  The Chinese name of Moobol is Zhi Bo Ke, which literally means \\"people who report live\\". The origin of the word \\"Moobol\\" derives from \\"Mobile\\", describing people who use digital cameras, cell phone cameras, video cameras or any other portable devices to capture or record what they have witnessed. Moobol is synonymous with citizen journalism.  History  Originally named Molive.cn, it was founded on January 1, 2006 by China Daily staffer Eric Zhang as a spin-off of Chinadaily.com.cn. It was initially created to provide internet service as well as other premium services to cell phone users in China. When the company noticed an influx of users uploading pictures from their cell phones to report live events such as traffic jams, street fights and fire accidents, Molive.cn narrowed its service to the picture uploading business. On October 18, 2006, Molive.cn changed its name to Moobol.com and primarily focused on providing a place on the internet for the common people to upload the photos they have taken with their digital cameras and camera phones. These photographs are usually uploaded in groups and accompanied with a brief description to illustrate an event or events that happened during the time the pictures were taken. Moobol.com is considered the pioneer citizen journalism web site in China. The creation of Moobol.com is significant because its model is revolutionary to the traditional Chinese media. On similar websites, bloggers often take the role of analysts rather than reporters. Since the beginning of the new millennium, a growing percentage of television stations and newspapers prefer news (photographs, audio, stories) by citizen journalists over the traditional media. The current media, whether it is television, newspaper, or radio, employee professional journalists to report the news they see fit, often with biased views. But due to geographical difference and the conflict of interest, working journalists do not possess the capability to be at every corner of China in any given time frame and they do not always report all the stories as they develop. Moobols (Moobol users/citizen journalists) upload and report content based exclusive and non-exclusive news stories often ignored by the mainstream media outlets.  Usage  As portable devices such as camera phones and digital cameras become more popular and easier to acquire, Moobols (Moobol users) can quickly upload their pictures or video files into Moobol.com via text messaging or direct website access.  Development  In the early days of development, Moobol realized the potential of China's 500 million and growing cell phone users. As the price of portal devices such as digital cameras and camera phones decreased sharply, it paved the way for ubiquitous usage of these picture capturing gadgets. In April 2007, Moobol.com began constructing local or grassroots channels for its users. Moobol has announced that it will launch its beta 2.0 version sometime in the summer of 2007. It has plans to launch an English version of its site in the near future to diversity its member base. The website is currently seeking Venture Capital funds both in China and abroad to further expand its services.  Features  = Beta 2.0 = Moobol.com is constructing its version beta2.0. The new version will be launched in June 2007. Its beta version strengthens mMobol's ability on user communication, photo uploading, categories, interactivity, user group and user's personal space. = Picpal = Picpal is an application for cell phone users. This software allows cell phone users to instantly upload their photos into the Moobol website. = Local Channels = Regional platforms will be constructed by Moobol.com to allow users from the same geographical location to share photos with each other. = Moobol Photo Contests = Moobol.com awards prizes to the winners of its photo contests, such as \\"New Year photo\\", \\"My-One-Day photo\\" and \\"Funny Things photo.\\" = Photo Wit-key = Moobol is in the process of developing its photo wit-key platform. It will benefit not only web administrators, but also regular users. Through the photo Wit-key platform Moobols (citizen journalists) have the ability to request for photos they want by offering a reward to those who can provide it to them. = New versions = Moobol.com is in the process of launching an English version for English-speaking readers and users. Due to the enormity of the photo inventory and Moobol's limited resources, Moobol.com editors will select popular pictures and translate them into English. = Authentication = Moobol.com automatically analyzes photos upload by users. It analyzes the date & time, the type of camera and the editing software used to produce any given uploaded picture. This allows Moobol to certify the authenticity of pictures upload by its users to avoid fabrications.  Corporate Affairs  =Business Model = Moobol has the right to sell photos uploaded by users and gain a percentage of the revenue. At the moment, some newspapers in Beijing such as The First, has an agreement with Moobol to purchase from its photo inventory. Since there are 6,600 newspaper and magazines in China, Moobol's business model is promising. On the other hand, as a photo-heavy web, Moobol users have strong consuming power and potential consuming power on digital cameras, camera cell phones and digital products. No wonder Moobol can gain a lot in ads. = Corporate structure = Moobol is now run by a Board of Directors consisting of 5 people, who include Eric Zhang (founder and CEO), two senior members from Chinadaily.com.cn (parent company) and two members from MAS Technology (shareholders). Moobol divided its personnel into five department; Business & Development, Editorial, Public Relations, Technology & Research and Administration. = Logo = Moobol's current logo, \\"Moobol Hands\\", was designed by Zhao Wei, the chief designer for Moobol.com in 2006. The logo, depicting two hands crossed to take a picture, exhibits the spirit of the Moobol culture, which is to \\"take picture on what you witnessed\\". In 2007, Moobol began striking the \\"Moobol Hands\\" onto every photo that are uploaded onto Moobol.com to protect the author's copyright. = Slogans = *\\"Snap, upload and share.\\" *\\"Capture what you witness.\\"  Headlines  = Sister Kindergarten = On November 15, 2006, a set of exclusive pictures of a beautiful kindergarten teacher under the alias \\"Sister Kindergarten\\" appeared on Moobol.com. Over night, it was forwarded by tens of thousands of people and was featured on thousands of websites in China. Within 3 days, \\"Sister Kindergarten\\" became an instant internet celebrity. In February 2007, \\"Sister Kindergarten\\" was named ‚ÄòLove Angel‚Äô by the Chinese Red Cross Foundation (CRCF). From that moment forward, Moobol became a well-known hotspot for creating internet celebrities. = Internet Cafe Inside Ancient Wall In Xi‚Äôan = On December 21, 2006, a Moobol user named Jin Chi Niao (Golden Wing Bird) took a group of pictures of an internet netbar built inside of the ancient City Wall in Xi‚Äôan. These pictures sparked a heated public debate. Supporters claim it is an efficient use of ancient achievements, while opponents argue the Internet cafe damages the aesthetic and historical value of the ancient wall as a whole. According to Jin Chi Niao, he was walking along the Xi'an Railway Station on December 21, 2006, and that's when he noticed a large sign of an internet cafe attached to the outer facet of an ancient city wall. He quickly snapped a group of pictures and uploaded onto Moobol.com along with its description. Television stations and newspapers subsequently interviewed Jinchiniao and on December 26, 2006 the signboard of the internet cafe had been pulled down.

It was part of what is commonly referred to as the Continuation War. Early in the war Finnish forces liberated the Karelian Isthmus. It had been ceded to the Soviet Union on 13 March 1940, in the Moscow Peace Treaty, which marked the end of the Winter War. Later, in the summer of 1944, the Soviet Union reconquered the southern part of the isthmus in the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive. Initial setup of the forces Finnish forces facing the Karelian Isthmus consisted of two Finnish army corps. The Finnish II Corps was north of Vuoksi River and the Finnish IV Corps south of it. Finnish II Corps was commanded by Major-General Taavetti Laatikainen and it consisted of three divisions (10th, 15th and 18th divisions) as 10th Division had been added to it after the II Corps had been forced to give the 2nd Division over to operations in the Ladoga Karelia.Nenye (2016) p. 91 Finnish IV Corps was commanded by Lieutenant General Karl Lennart Oesch and had two divisions and a reinforced regiment placed at front lines (8th and 12th divisions together with reinforced 25th Infantry Regiment) and single division (4th Division) as its reserve.Nenye (2016) p. 99 When the operation started the defending Soviet forces consisted nominally of 2 separate army corps (19th and 50th corps). Soviet 19th Corps consisted of two divisions (115th and 142nd divisions), one motorized division (198th Motorized Division) and a motorized regiment (14th Motorized Rifle Regiment). Soviet 198th Motorized Division was tied down in fighting near Sortavala while the two other divisions manned the positions close to the border. Soviet 265th Rifle Division was en route to act as reserve.Nenye (2016) p. 92 The relatively quiet front prompted Soviet leadership to transfer the command elements of the 50th Corps to south of Leningrad on 21 July leaving its divisions (43rd and 123rd Rifle Divisions) under direct command of the Soviet 23rd Army.Nenye (2016) p. 100 Advance to lake Ladoga Map depicting the Finnish offensive operations in Karelia carried out in the Summer and Autumn of 1941 during the Continuation War. The furthest advance of Finnish units in the Continuation War and borders for both before and after the Winter War are shown. The advance of the Finnish II Corps started on 31 July. Soviet defenses slowed down the Finnish advance, especially due to the Finnish tactic of advancing through forest, which caused severe logistical problems. By August 14 the Finnish 18th Division captured the town and crossing point of Antrea, which left the Soviet 115th Rifle Divisions separated from the rest of the Soviet 19th Corps. Advance in almost terrain that lacked useful roads also slowed the Finnish 15th Division's advance and it only managed to capture the town of Hiitola on 11 August after the Finnish 10th Division was also deployed to the front lines. The Finnish victory at Hiitola forced the Soviet 142nd Rifle and 198th Motorized Divisions to withdraw into Kilpola islands, where they were surrounded into a 'motti' against the shore of the lake Ladoga. Finns cleared the motti by 23 August, but by then Soviets had already evacuated over the lake Ladoga 26,000 men from the encirclement.Nenye (2016) pp. 93-96 The Soviet control of the Karelian Isthmus near lake Ladoga was crumbling after the defeat of the two Soviet divisions. Finnish 10th Division came across the newly arrived Soviet 265th Division on 15 August and after the ensuing battle encircled the remains of the Soviet division. A small part of the 265th Division managed to escape two days later; by that time division's casualties already amounted to 234 dead, 1155 wounded and 4830 missing in action. The Finnish victories allowed Finnish forces to act more freely, and Finns captured the remains of the town of K√§kisalmi on 21 August and village of Taipale on 23 August. Finnish 18th Division started its crossing of Vuoksi river on 17 August and managed to create a solid bridgehead.Nenye (2016) p. 96-99 Capture of Viipuri The main objective for the Finnish IV Corps was the city of Viipuri, and the plan called for surrounding and quickly capturing the town. However, the Finnish General HQ did not allow IV Corps to start actively pursuing the Soviets until 21 August. By this time the Soviet 43rd and 123rd Rifle Divisions had already started withdrawing from their exposed positions close to the border, while the Soviet 115th Rifle Division was racing to contain the Finnish crossing of Vuoksi. This meant that the Finnish plan of tying down the Soviets had failed before it even could have been put to action. However the crossing of Vuoksi by the Finnish 18th Division of the II Corps was assisted by the Finnish 12th Division and the Light Brigade T (named after its commander, Colonel Tiiainen, consisted of 1st J√§ger Battalion, two light detachments and two artillery companies) of the IV Corps which managed to punch through the Soviet lines.Nenye (2016) p. 99-101 Soviet withdrawal to the narrow part of the Karelian Isthmus allowed the Soviets to bring their numbers to bear. Soviet 115th and 123rd Rifle Divisions were tasked with throwing the Finnish back over the Vuoksi river and their attack started on 24 August. Soviet attack hit the Finnish Light Brigade T and forced the Finns to either retreat or to dug in. As a result, the Finnish brigade was immobilized and partially surrounded. On 25 August a chance artillery strike killed the Light Brigade T's commander, but then the Finnish forces relieving the Light Brigade T turned the attack and forced the Soviet divisions to retreat. Finnish IV Corps proceeded to cut the routes south from Viipuri. On 24 August the Finnish 8th Division crossed the Viipuri Bay and cut the coastal route out from Viipuri. By 28 August the Soviet 43rd, 115th and 123rd Rifle Divisions and been encircled at the Battle of Porlammi into a motti around the villages of Sommee and Porlampi.Nenye (2016) p. 105-107 The Finns had cut all the roads to the motti, but they were unable to form a tight blockade in the thick forests, which allowed the majority of the men of the Soviet 115th and 123rd Rifle Divisions to escape towards Koivisto. However, the bulk of the Soviet 43rd Rifle Division was destroyed at the Battle of Porlammi on 1 September. The Finns force marched to the village and port of Koivisto on 2 September, but did not pursue the remnants of the Soviet divisions which had fled to the surrounding archipelago - these units were later, in November, evacuated by the Soviets. While the fighting near Viipuri was still ongoing, the Finnish advance towards Leningrad continued. Finnish IV Corps was to advance along the western shore, the II Corps in the center and the newly arrived I Corps along the eastern side of the Isthmus. Finnish commander in chief, Marshal Mannerheim, ordered the Finnish advance to hold short of the Soviet fortifications. Finnish forces reached the old border on August 31 and in early September the Soviet fortifications where the Finns stopped their advance.Nenye (2016) p. 107-108 German pressure to attack Leningrad and the end of offensive On 20 August, General W. Erfurth notified Mannerheim that Field Marshal W. Wilhelm Keitel would send a letter describing where Finns were asked to attack Leningrad. Mannerheim explained the practical difficulties of the proposal and presented the opposition of both the political and military leadership to this attack. The government had decided beforehand that Finland would not attack Leningrad, and it was only after pressure from the military leadership that they accepted a small advance across the old border to capture better defensive positions. The Social Democrats especially opposed crossing the border. When Keitel's letter came, Ryti and Mannerheim together prepared a negative answer. On 31 August, Erfurth contacted Mannerheim again and proposed that Finns should cancel the attack to East Karelia and instead attack Leningrad. Ryti and Mannerheim again refused. On 31 August Mannerheim gave the order that the attack be stopped at the line from the mouth of the river Rajajoki to Ohta. The exact line between Ohta and Lake Ladoga would be ordered later, when the Finns had reached the old border there. That would shorten the frontline without the need to attack Soviet fortifications north of Leningrad (KaUR). In this last phase, the Soviets had six infantry divisions and a number of separate battalions and regiments defending Leningrad from the north, but all of them were at half strength due to the hard fighting with the Finns. 12.D had reached the target already on September 1, but elsewhere the attack started on 2 September. 18.D captured Mainila at the same day and Valkeasaari (now Beloostrov) the next day. By 7 September both 18.D and 2.D had reached their targets between River Rajajoki and Ohta. The commander of I Corps, Colonel M√§kinen, ordered his troops to advance to the line Ohta-Lake Lempaalanj√§rvi-Old border at Lake Ladoga with an addition, that if strong defences were met, the offensive could be stopped there. On 4 September the attack began, and on 6 September 10.D managed to encircle and destroy Soviet IR941 at Kirjasalo. Finally on September 9 the objective line was reached everywhere and Finnish forces moved to the defensive. The Soviet military leadership quickly learned of lessened Finnish pressure, and already on 5 September two divisions were transferred from the Karelian Isthmus to the south of the city, against the Germans. Although the Finnish troops on the Karelian Isthmus did not actively participate in the Siege of Leningrad, merely their existence contributed to the siege by hampering the supply of the city around and across the Lake Ladoga. Half of the Finnish part of the Isthmus was reconquered by the Soviet Union in the Fourth strategic offensive in 1944.

It was initially characterized by constant instability and was threatened by the possibility of a civil war during the early post-revolutionary years. A new constitution was drafted, censorship was prohibited, free speech declared, political prisoners were released and major Estado Novo institutions were closed. Eventually the country granted independence to its African colonies and begun a process of democratization that led to the accession of Portugal to the EEC (today's European Union) in 1986.  Background  The carnation, the symbol of the Revolution that stated the Third Portuguese Republic. In Portugal, 1926 marked the end of the First Republic, in a military coup that established an authoritarian government called Estado Novo, that was led by Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar until 1968, when he was forced to step down due to health problems. Salazar was succeeded by Marcelo Caetano. The government faced many internal and external problems, including the Portuguese Colonial War. On 25 April 1974 a mostly bloodless coup of young military personnel forced Marcelo Caetano to step down. Most of the population of the country soon supported this uprising. It was called the Carnation Revolution because of the use of the carnation on soldiers' rifles as a symbol of peace. This revolution was the beginning of the Portuguese Third Republic. The days after the revolution saw widespread celebration for the end of 48 years of dictatorship and soon exiled politicians like √Ålvaro Cunhal and M√°rio Soares returned to the country for the celebration of May Day, in what became a symbol of the country's regained freedom.  After the revolution  After the fall of the Estado Novo, differences began to emerge on which political direction the country should take, including among the military. The revolution was mainly the result of the work of a group of young officers unified under the Movimento das For√ßas Armadas (MFA). Within this group, there were several different political views, among them those represented by Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho and considered to be the more radical wing of the movement and those represented by Ernesto Melo Antunes, considered to be the more moderate one. In addition to that, to ensure the success of the uprising, the MFA looked for support among the conservative sections of the military that had been disaffected with the Caetano government, chief among which were the former Head of the Armed Forces, General Francisco da Costa Gomes, and General Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola. Both had been expelled from the Estado-Maior-General das For√ßas Armadas for criticizing the government. The differing political views came to be broadly represented by three main informal groups, which included both military and civilians. However, even within these groups that shared similar political views there were considerable disagreements. * the conservatives: within the military, represented by Costa Gomes and Sp√≠nola and within the MFA by Melo Antunes. Its civilian representatives were politicians that had been part of the Ala Liberal (Liberal Wing) of the Assembleia Nacional (National Assembly) that called for a transition to democracy, among them the future Prime-Ministers Francisco de S√° Carneiro and Francisco Pinto Balsem√£o. * the socialists: that were in favour of creating a social- democratic state like those of Western Europe and were mainly represented by the Socialist Party and its leader M√°rio Soares. * the communists: that were in favour of creating a communist state with an economic system similar to those of the Warsaw Pact countries. The main representative of this group within the military and the MFA was Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, while the main political party included in this group was the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), led by √Ålvaro Cunhal. 2000s In 2001, Ant√≥nio Guterres, the Prime Minister since 1995, resigned after the local elections, and after legislative elections on the following year, Jos√© Manuel Barroso was appointed as the new Prime Minister. Ant√≥nio Costa, current Prime Minister =The Euro= On 1 January 2002, Portugal adopted the euro as its currency in place of the escudo. =Euro 2004= Euro 2004 was held across Portugal. The final match was won by Greece against Portugal. Several new stadia were built or rebuilt for the event. This event granted Portugal an opportunity to show its hosting abilities to the rest of the world. =2006 presidential elections= The Portuguese presidential election were held on 22 January 2006 to elect a successor to the incumbent President Jorge Sampaio, who was prevented from running for a third consecutive term by the Constitution of Portugal. The result was a victory in the first round for An√≠bal Cavaco Silva of the Social Democratic Party, the former Prime Minister, who won 50.59 per cent of the vote in the first round, just over the majority required to avoid a runoff election. Voter turnout was 62.60 per cent of eligible voters. =Economic difficulties= From 2007-8 onwards, Portugal was severely affected by the European sovereign-debt crisis. The legacy of considerable borrowing from earlier years became an almost unsustainable debt for the Portuguese economy, bringing the country to the verge of bankruptcy by 2011. This resulted in urgent measures to address structural problems in the economy, raise taxes and reduce public-sector spending. Increasing unemployment also led to increased emigration.

Known as Three Notch Road, the state highway runs between its southern intersection with MD 5 in Ridge and its northern intersection with MD 5 near Mechanicsville. While the southern part of the state highway is a quiet rural road, the northern part of MD 235 is a four- to six-lane divided highway connecting Naval Air Station Patuxent River (NAS Patuxent River) and the Washington, D.C., metro area in conjunction with MD 5\\\\. Three Notch Road has been the main highway between northern St. Mary's County and Point Lookout since the colonial era. The highway was reconstructed as the modern MD 235 between 1923 and 1938. The state highway was then completely rebuilt during World War II to serve the recently established NAS Patuxent River. Between 1960 and 1985, MD 235 was converted into a four-lane divided highway to the west and north of the military base. In the face of increasing activity at the base, the highway adjacent to NAS Patuxent River was expanded to six lanes in the early 2000s. Route description View north from the south end of MD 235 at MD 5 in Ridge MD 235 begins at an intersection with MD 5 (Point Lookout Road) in Ridge. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road that passes through the community of Dameron and to the west of The Elms Wildlife Management Area. MD 235 meets the eastern end of MD 489 (Park Hall Road), a connector between MD 235 and MD 5, east of Park Hall Estates. The state highway passes a section of old alignment, Poplar Ridge Road, on the east, then curves northwest and intersects MD 712 (Forest Park Road) and Hermanville Road in the hamlet of Hermanville at the southern edge of NAS Patuxent River. MD 235 expands to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane and the highway runs along the western edge of the military base. The state highway intersects MD 246 (Great Mills Road), which serves the main gate of NAS Patuxent River, in the center of Lexington Park. MD 235 continues northwest along the boundary of NAS Patuxent River as a six-lane divided highway. Beyond Pegg Road, which heads east to another entrance to the military base, the highway leaves the vicinity of the naval air station. MD 235 continues into California, where the highway meets the northern end of MD 237 (Chancellors Run Road). A short distance to the north, MD 235 intersects MD 4, which heads west as St. Andrew's Church Road and east as Patuxent Beach Road toward the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge over the Patuxent River to Calvert County. Beyond MD 4, the highway reduces to a four-lane divided highway and passes to the east of St. Mary's County Regional Airport. The first of several sections of old alignment, (Mervell Dean Road), splits to the north; the northern portion of the old highway is MD 944\\\\. MD 235 continues past Clarks Landing Road, which is unsigned MD 944C, before it receives the northern end of MD 944 a little south of the main road's intersection with MD 245 (Hollywood Road/Sotterley Road) in Hollywood. MD 235 receives Old Three Notch Road as it leaves Hollywood, then it parallels another of its former courses, Clover Hill Road, as the highway passes through Hillville. Beyond the intersection with MD 472 (North Sandgates Road), MD 235 passes through Oakville, where another old alignment, Oakville Road, splits to the north before the main road intersects MD 247 (Loveville Road). Mt. Zion Church Road, yet another old alignment, splits to the north in the hamlet of Laurel Grove before MD 235 intersects the eastern terminus of MD 6 (New Market‚ÄìTurner Road) and Morganza‚ÄìTurner Road in Oraville. The final old alignment of MD 235, Harpers Corner Road, splits to the west shortly before the state highway reaches its northern terminus at MD 5 near Mechanicsville. MD 5 heads southwest as two-lane Point Lookout Road toward Leonardtown. Northbound MD 5 continues straight on the divided highway as Three Notch Road toward Charlotte Hall and Waldorf. MD 235 is part of the main National Highway System from MD 246 in Lexington Park to its northern junction with MD 5 in Mechanicsville. The highway is also a National Highway System principal arterial between MD 712 and MD 246 in Lexington Park. History MD 235 follows the path of what was the first major long-distance highway in St. Mary's County, the Patuxent Main Road. The road, established by 1692, connected Point Lookout and northern St. Mary's County along the drainage divide between the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. The Patuxent Main Road later became known as the Three Notch Road based on a 1704 law that stated \\"three notches of equal distance marked on the trees indicated a road leading to a ferry.\\" The whereabouts of the ferry to which this road led are unknown. After 200 years of little improvement, reconstruction of the Three Notch Road by the Maryland State Roads Commission began in 1923 when the highway was rebuilt as a wide gravel road from MD 5 near Mechanicsville south to MD 472 in Oakville. The gravel road was extended south from Oakville to Friendship School Road in 1924. MD 235 northbound approaching intersection with Clover Hill Road and South Sandgates Road Construction on Three Notch Road resumed in 1926 when two sections were placed under construction. A segment of gravel highway was constructed south from MD 246 in Jarboesville (now Lexington Park) toward Hermanville in 1926 and 1927. The northern segment of MD 235 was extended to Hillville in 1928 and to Hollywood in 1929. The southern gravel section of the highway was extended south to Hermanville in 1930. Also in 1930, construction on the gap between Hollywood and Jarboesville began and a new segment of MD 235 was started from Ridge north to Dameron. The Ridge‚ÄìDameron segment was completed in 1932 and the gravel highway from Hollywood to Jarboesville was finished in 1933. The gravel section constructed from Ridge reached Bay Forest Road by 1935 and Hermanville in 1938, completing MD 235. Immediately after the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, the U.S. Navy made plans to construct a naval air station on the Cedar Point peninsula near Jarboesville. MD 235 was marked for an upgrade from MD 5 to Jarboesville both to connect the new military installation with Washington and to allow the road to handle the heavy military traffic that would travel the highway during the military base's construction and operations. The highway was under construction by the end of 1942. The highway's gravel surface was widened as a first layer and surface treated in autumn 1943 to help heavy traffic during the winter. In spring 1944 the first layer was scarified and the top were mixed with asphalt to form a base. This base was covered with a wearing surface of bituminous concrete. MD 235 was also reconstructed in this manner from Jarboesville to Hermanville in 1944 and 1945; included in that project was the construction of MD 712 to provide a modern highway to the naval air station's South Gate. During the reconstruction of MD 235, the highway was relocated in many places between Mechanicsville and Hollywood to remove substandard curves and avoid grade crossings with the southern extension of the Washington, Brandywine and Point Lookout Railroad that the U.S. Navy constructed contemporaneously to provide a rail link to the military base. Many of the bypassed stretches of highway‚Äîwhich included Harpers Corner Road in Oraville, Mount Zion Church Road in Laurel Grove, Oakville Road in Oakville, Clover Hill Road in Hillville, Old Three Notch Road in Hollywood, and the southernmost portion of Mervell Dean Road‚Äîwere designated as sections of MD 722. MD 235 northbound approaching MD 6 in Oraville The next major project along MD 235 was the reconstruction of the 1930s gravel highway between Ridge and Hermanville. Construction began in 1957 from Hermanville and was completed south to Park Hall in 1959, with the remainder of the highway completed around 1960. MD 235 was relocated between Park Hall and Hermanville, leaving behind Poplar Ridge Road as an old alignment. Also in 1960, the state highway was expanded to a divided highway from Hermanville to Lexington Park. MD 235 was widened to a divided highway from Hollywood to Hillville in 1968, from Mechanicsville to Oakville in 1969, and from MD 246 in Lexington Park to Town Creek Drive in California in 1973. Two sections of divided highway were completed in 1982: from Town Creek Drive to just north of the newly constructed MD 4 intersection in California; and from Oakville to Hillville. The final segment of MD 235 between Hermanville and Mechanicsville to be expanded to a divided highway was completed from California to Hollywood in 1985. The portion of the state highway from just north of St. Mary's County Regional Airport to just south of MD 245 in Hollywood was relocated to the west along the right-of-way of the Washington, Brandywine and Point Lookout Railroad, which had earlier been abandoned. The bypassed highway was renamed as a northward extension of Mervell Dean Road and designated MD 944\\\\. MD 235 was widened in Lexington Park and California between 2000 and 2004 due to increased activity at the military base and its supporting industries. The state highway was widened to six lanes from north of Pegg Road to Town Creek Drive in 2000 and from Town Creek Drive to just north of MD 4 in 2001. Expansion to six lanes occurred from FDR Boulevard to north of Pegg Road in 2003. The final section of widening occurred in 2004 when the six-lane section was extended south from FDR Boulevard to MD 246\\\\. MD 235 between MD 712 and MD 246 was transformed from a four-lane divided highway to a five-lane road with center turn lane in 2004 as well.

Hadjidakis, M. Theodorakis, M. Loizos and others. She began her discographical career by signing with Lyra Music, releasing her first album alongside another rising artist Giorgos Gerolymatos called \\"Min Kaneis Oneira\\" in 1978. This release caused a stir in the industry, showcasing Glykeria's unique voice to the nation. =1980-1985: Rise To Fame= At the beginning of the 1980s, Glykeria released her first solo album, \\"Ta Smyrneika\\", a compilation album with traditional songs from Smyrna. During the following years, Glykeria performed at well-known clubs and bouzoukia, gaining momentum and many fans, and collaborating with other well- known singers, including George Dalaras. The same year she released her debut album \\"Sta Matia Koita Me\\", which was composed entirely by Stelios Fotiadis and marked the beginning of their successful continuing collaboration. In 1982, she was selected to represent Greece in the Europalia '82 festival in Brussels, together with Sotiria Bellou, George Dalaras and Margarita Zorbala. The following year, Glykeria released her first official live concert \\"Omorfi Nyhta\\" and due to its massive success Lyra released her first live album, \\"me ti Glykeria Stin Omorfi Nyhta\\", which went on to break every musical sales record in Greece up to that point.

She has sung in concerts in Greece and abroad (Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Cyprus, Israel and Turkey). Due to the successful concerts she gave in Israel she was proclaimed most popular foreign singer; the Mayor of Jerusalem awarded her the golden key of the city (1994). Three albums were released in Israel at the same time, all of them gold in a very short time: Glykeria golden-hits, Far away, Glykeria ‚Äì 14 classics, and her first album in France: Golden hits ‚Äì The voice of Greece. In 1998, her second album was released in France. She took part in two albums for the American label Putumayo and in compilations released in Europe.

In the First Arion Awards in Greece she was awarded the prize for best Greek popular singer. Glykeria, \\"The Sweet one\\" in Greek, has been a successful female singer in Greece for many years. In the summer of 1993 she performed in Israel for the first time. She ended her performance with her own captivating version of an Israeli folk song \\"Shabechi Yerushaly'im\\" (\\"Praise the Lord, Jerusalem!\\") in Hebrew. Glykeria became the most loved Greek singer in Israel and a major part of Israel's cultural scene in the 1990s. Her special style full of depth, melancholy and endless emotion captured the heart of the Israelis, and her songs, both in Hebrew (with near perfect pronunciation) and Greek became all-time classics. She became a \\"household\\" name in Israel, an \\"honorary citizen\\", a platinum and gold albums seller, and the favorite of Israel's top leaders and celebrities. Her deep connection to Israel culminated in 1998 when she was the only foreign artist to be invited to sing in the special memorial event for Yitzhak Rabin, the beloved leader who was assassinated three years before.

They entered the inter-district competition, playing against Wentworthville, Sydney University, Penrith and other clubs in the Sydney area. In 1967 the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) added two new clubs to the competition, Cronulla- Sutherland and Penrith, the first to join the competition since Parramatta and Manly were admi In mid-1968 the club moved permanently to Endeavour Field at Woolooware, thus becoming the only club in Sydney to own their own ground. Their first match there was against Parramatta and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks won 10‚Äì7. 1970s Captain-coached by Englishman Tommy Bishop, Cronulla-Sutherland made the end-of-season play-offs for the first time in 1973. They lost only five games and finished just one point behind minor premiers Manly, and ahead of local rivals St George. The Sharks made it to the grand final against the Sea Eagles but in a brutal encounter lost 10‚Äì7. Cronulla-Sutherland met the Sea Eagles again in the 1978 grand final, amidst much controversy surrounding referee Greg Hartley. The Sharks led by 7-2 well into the second half. Manly came back and brought the scoreboard to 11‚Äì7. It took a late penalty goal from Steve Rogers to level scores at 11-all by full- time. The replay saw the Sharks' opportunity pass by as they fielded a much- weakened team due to further injuries, eventually being shut-out by Manly 16‚Äì0. Cronulla were without suspended stars Greg Pierce and Dane Sorensen in both games, while hooker John McMartin, fullback Mick Mullane and Barry Andrews were all injured for the replay. In 1979, Cronulla won the mid-week Amco Cup competition, their first trophy in the top grade, beating Combined Brisbane 22‚Äì5. 1980s Cronulla suffered major financial trouble in 1983, with the NSWRL appointing an administrator and providing a loan. Western Suburbs and Newtown, both in a similar predicament, were refused a loan, with Newtown being forced out of the competition. However, the season wasn't all bad for Cronulla, with the emergence of teenage star, Andrew Ettingshausen, who was named Rookie of the Year, and would later go on to become the most capped and successful player for Cronulla. Cronulla also made the final of the mid-week KB Cup, but lost again to Manly, 26‚Äì6. In 1985, Cronulla was buoyed by the arrival of 'super coach' Jack Gibson, who had coached Easts and Parramatta to premierships. Gibson left the club in good shape in 1987, with the promise fulfilled in 1988 when Cronulla won the minor premiership, led by veteran second-rower Gavin Miller, who was named Dally M Player of the Year, and Rothmans Medal winning halfback, Barry Russell. However, Russell dislocated his shoulder two weeks before the finals, and missed the semi-final where Cronulla went down to Canterbury. He was rushed back in for the final against Balmain, but he was severely hampered by the injury, and Cronulla were bundled out. A bright spot for the Sharks, though, was the selection in the Australian team of Miller, and young centres, Ettingshausen and Mark McGaw. In 1989, Cronulla sneaked into the finals after thrashing Illawarra 46‚Äì14 in the final round, followed by a memorable 38‚Äì14 victory over the Brisbane Broncos in the play-off for fifth position. However, they could not repeat the performance in their semi-final against eventual premiers Canberra, in what was their third game in seven days. Gavin Miller was rewarded for another great year with both the Dally M Player of the Year award and the Rothmans Medal. 1990s Cronulla again dropped into a period of poor form and financial trouble in 1990, but the appointment as coach of rugby league Immortal, Arthur Beetson, in 1992 helped turn the on-field problems around. He helped develop a batch of promising players, including five-eighth Mitch Healey, fullback David Peachey, winger Richie Barnett, prop Adam Ritson, and hooker Aaron Raper, son of another Immortal, Johnny Raper. However, Cronulla were forced into receivership in 1993. In 1993 Lou Ferrigno was brought in to speak to Sharks players about the benefits of weight-training. Beetson was replaced as coach in 1994 by John Lang, a former Australian hooker, and coach of the Brisbane Easts team. Lang brought halfback, Paul Green, down from Brisbane with him. A golden age for the club had begun, signalled by the two lower grade teams (President's Cup and Reserve grade) winning their competitions. During John Lang's coaching period, from 1994 to 2001, Cronulla made the semi-finals every year except for 1994 and 1998. The club had a glamorous image and attracted record crowds, with a corresponding financial improvement. In 1995, Cronulla were one of the first clubs to join the Super League competition, which kicked off after protracted legal battles and much bitterness, in 1997. The club was motivated by a dissatisfaction with the perceived favouritism of the NSWRL administration towards other clubs, and a still-risky financial situation. They reached the inaugural - and only - grand final of the ten-team competition, Cronulla made the Super League grand final and went on to lose to Brisbane 26‚Äì12 in Brisbane. The game was notable for being the only grand final to be played outside Sydney. The club rejoined the reunited National Rugby League competition in 1998. Arguably the Sharks' best season ever was in 1999, when they again won the minor premiership in convincing fashion. The Sharks easily accounted for the Brisbane Broncos in the quarter-final, and led 8‚Äì0 in the grand final qualifier against the St George Illawarra Dragons before eventually losing 8-24. The Dragons went on to lose the 1999 grand final against the Melbourne Storm 20‚Äì18. 2000s Cronulla lost the grand final qualifier in similar circumstances in 2001, to eventual premiers Newcastle. The year was marked by the sudden rise of halfback Preston Campbell, who was named Dally M Player of the Year, despite being a fringe first grader at the start of the season. In 2002, John Lang was replaced by Australian coach, Chris Anderson, who had led Canterbury Bulldogs and Melbourne Storm to premierships. The following two years were the most acrimonious in the club's history. The first year was almost an on-field success, as Anderson retained the core of John Lang's team, and the Sharks again reached the grand final qualifier. However another heartbreaking loss to New Zealand, the replacement of halfback Campbell - a crowd favourite - with former Melbourne halfback Brett Kimmorley, and a string of released players signalled trouble for 2003. This was realised with the sudden mid-season departure of long-time stars, Nick Graham and Dean Treister. The Sharks finished 11th, suffering a record 74-4 loss to Parramatta in a match marred by the controversial performance of referee, Shayne Hayne. Three Cronulla players were sent from the field, including Sharks captain David Peachey, for ignoring the referee's instructions. Constant infighting between the board and the coach led to Anderson's departure at the end of the season. Anderson was replaced by Stuart Raper, another son of Johnny Raper, and the coach of the President's Cup winning team in 1994. A loyal clubman, he instantly brought a revival in club and supporter spirit. The club's name reverted to Cronulla- Sutherland. Steve Rogers, the CEO of the Cronulla Sharks and a former club legend, died on 3 January 2006 at the age of 51 from a \\"mixture of prescription drugs and alcohol.\\" In April, 2006, the NSW state coroner ruled that the death was accidental. On 21 April 2006, the Australian Government announced they would be funding a $9.6 million upgrade to Toyota Park. Funding will be going towards extending the E.T. Stand. Cronulla finished the 2006 season in disastrous fashion. After winning 8 out of 9 games in the middle of the season and climbing to near the top of the ladder, the team experienced the worst losing streak in the club's history, losing their last 10 games. In a bizarre finish to a tumultuous season, the Sharks narrowly failed to win their final game after coming back from 26-0 down to lose 26-24 to Canberra. A missed penalty goal in the dying seconds of the match would have sent the game into extra-time, allowing the chance for Cronulla to equal the biggest single- game comeback in the history of top-level rugby league in Australia. On 22 September 2006, the Sharks Board ended weeks of speculation over the future of coach Stuart Raper by sacking him as first grade coach and handing him a $300,000 payout, making him the second consecutive coach to receive such a payout. On 26 September, Australian Test coach Ricky Stuart signed a 3-year deal to coach the Sharks from 2007, replacing Raper. Round one of the 2007 season saw the Sharks break their 10-game losing streak against the Penrith Panthers with an 18‚Äì0 victory at Toyota Park. Ricky Stuart, despite being somewhat hampered by the decisions of former coach Raper in the team he inherited, led the Sharks to fifth on the ladder at the halfway mark of the season surprising many critics. Towards the end of the season, Cronulla plunged to 15th on the league ladder, slumping to seven straight losses. The season ended with the Sharks in 11th place, rounding off a heartbreaking season, with the club losing no less than nine matches by 4 points or less. The Sharks had a strong season in 2008, finishing the season in equal first spot (third on for and against). They had one of the best defensive records, but one of the worst attacking records in the league. They had an excellent start to the season, beating defending grand finalists Manly and premiers Melbourne in away games in the first two rounds. After a comprehensive 36‚Äì10 victory over Canberra in the Qualifying Final at Toyota Stadium, Cronulla were beaten 28‚Äì0 by Melbourne (who later were found to be over the salary cap and cheating) in the Preliminary Final at the Sydney Football Stadium. This was a disappointing end to an otherwise successful season. Manly in August 2009 During the 2009 season Cronulla's dire financial problems became public knowledge. Asset-rich, owning its stadium and the surrounding land, but with cash flow problems due to its low average home gate and poor on-field performances in recent seasons, the club announced plans for a partial relocation to the Central Coast, which was rebuffed by the NRL. It was to split home games for the 2010‚Äì14 seasons among: * 6 at Toyota Park, to include local derbies with the St George Illawarra Dragons and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, * 5 at Central Coast Stadium in Gosford, Central Coast, and * 1 at Hindmarsh Stadium in Adelaide, South Australia. On May 26, 2009 businessman Damian Irvine, together with a fresh board of directors, took over control of the club as the St George bank were threatening to foreclose. The recorded 9 straight losses after a win in Round 1 in 2009 and despite a mid-season revival with four straight wins, the Cronulla side slipped to ten straight defeats to equal the club's worst losing streak. One of these losses caused great controversy as the Sharks, playing against Manly, were forced to field just 12 men for most of the game after Luke Douglas was sent off by referee Phil Haines for a careless high tackle. The Sharks managed to avoid the wooden spoon in 2009 when the Roosters were soundly beaten by the Cowboys in the final round, resulting in a lower overall standing than the Sharks, with avoiding last position a rare positive in a horror season for the Cronulla club. 2010s The start of the 2010 season saw the Sharks return confident of turning around recent disappointing results, however on-field performance remained poor. After the board developed a plan to refinance debt and a long- term financial strategy, Richard Fisk resigned in June 2010 due to his failure to find common ground with Chairman Irvine and his Board and a failure to refresh the commercial area of the club. The club's head coach, Ricky Stuart, also tendered his resignation and was replaced towards the back end of the season by his then-assistant coach Shane Flanagan. Promising wing/centre Blake Ferguson was criticized for comments about wanting to leave the club in order to achieve success. On Tuesday, July 20 Ricky Stuart left the Sharks for the rest of the season after admitting he could get no more out of the players and had \\"lost\\" them. Chairman Irvine opted to give a chance to Assistant NSW and Cronulla coach Shane Flanagan. After departing, Stuart and Fisk also cited fractured relationships with Chairman Damian Irvine as a reason for their departure despite the club making positive strides off-field under his guidance and commitment. The 2011 season started so promising for the club. The addition of Wade Graham at five-eighth and New Zealand international Jeremy Smith to a pack already containing two origin players promised an end to the Sharks' status as cellar-dwellers. Despite being humiliated by the Raiders at Canberra Stadium in round one, 40‚Äì12, the club won its next two matches. They beat defending premiers St. George Illawarra 16‚Äì10 at home in round two, and smashed Penrith 44‚Äì12 at Centerbet Stadium. Missing a number of first-team starters due to injury, the Sharks then lost five in a row to the Warriors (26-18), Sea Eagles (19-13), Knights (24-20), Cowboys (30-12), and Rabbitohs (31-12), dropping down the table, from 9th to 15th. They broke their hoodoo in round ten, when they beat the struggling Sydney Roosters 18‚Äì4 at Toyota Stadium. They were again disappointing in round eleven, when they were defeated 40-6 by the Eels at Parramatta Stadium. Despite losing 14‚Äì8 to the Storm in round 12, they were much improved and forced the Storm into a classic showdown at AAMI Park in Melbourne. They then faced the Broncos at home in round 13, going down 34‚Äì16, before a bye in round 14 gave them the chance to regroup. While the Sharks were taking a much needed break skipper Paul Gallen led the NSW Blues Origin team to a memorable 18‚Äì8 victory over Queensland. He then played outstandingly for the Sharks in their round 15 match against the Bulldogs just three days after the State of Origin match, a game in which Cronulla beat Canterbury-Bankstown 26‚Äì10. The next four weeks saw a turnaround of the club's performance, with victory over the Gold Coast Titans 36-12 and the South Sydney Rabbitohs 24‚Äì4, before they took revenge against the Canberra Raiders 26‚Äì12. Cronulla lost their two props for the 2012 season, Origin representative Kade Snowden to Newcastle and Luke Douglas signing for the Gold Coast Titans. Captain Paul Gallen's transformation into an Origin prop alleviated this problem somewhat, and the Sharks were active in the player market, signing prop Jon Green from St George Illawarra, former Shark Isaac de Gois, prop Mark Taufua from Newcastle, halfback Jeff Robson from Parramatta and props Bryce Gibbs and Andrew Fifita from Wests Tigers. 2012 began very well for the club under Chairman Damian Irvine, Coach Shane Flanagan. The recruitment by Mooney and Flanagan paid dividends with new recruits Jeff Robson, Andrew Fifita, Todd Carney, Ben Ross, Isaac De Gois and Mark Taufua taking pressure off Paul Gallen allowing him to hit a purple patch of form. The club won 6 matches in a row for the first time in over a decade and after 8 rounds were sitting third on the table as the highest placed Sydney based franchise. A difficult State of Origin period saw injuries to captain Paul Gallen and star Todd Carney. The Sharks struggled to recover and struggled in the back half of the year, however still capped a remarkable turnaround by qualifying for their first finals series in 4 years, losing to Canberra in week one. The match notable for seeing Paul Gallen outplayed by young rival Josh Papalli and Todd Carney injuring his Achilles. Sponsorship deals with SHARK Energy Drink, Fisherman's Friend, and Luxbet flooded in and helped the financial situation off-field, with the close of Season 2012 seeing Shane Flanagan emerge as one of the game's leading up and coming head coaches and his mentor Damian Irvine the game's leading young administrator. At the beginning of Season 2013, Irvine stood down as Chairman on learning of the questionable operational and duty of care practices of coach Shane Flanagan, and Darren Mooney during 2011 which exposed the club to the ASADA scandal. Flanagan was stood down and Peter Sharp stepped up to the head coaching role. Flanagan returned in 2013, a season in which the Sharks qualified for the competition semi finals, before he was forced to serve a 9-month suspension handed down by the NRL for breaches of basic governance and duty of care practices, thus validating the strong ethical stance made by Irvine and the board in March 2013. Sharp again took over the reins, before resigning mid season the week after the club's greatest comeback victory, with the team coming from 22 nil down to beat the Brisbane Broncos 24‚Äì22. Following that win, a photo went viral of Sharks playmaker Todd Carney urinating into his own mouth. Just one day after Carney was stood down by the Sharks CEO Steve Noyce, Sharp resigned as interim head coach and was replaced by James Shepherd. The 2014 season saw a myriad of struggles for the Sharks on the field, with injuries and the suspension of five players involved in the supplements scandal of 2011, missing games at the back end of the season. The Sharks finished 2014 with the wooden spoon. In 2015, the club climbed the ladder to eventually finish 6th with 2 wins over eventual minor premiers Sydney Roosters and 2014's premiers South Sydney Rabbitohs. 2015 was also the year Flanagan was reappointed as coach of Cronulla after sitting out the 2014 season. In 2016, an unprecedented record of 15 straight wins for the club saw them climb to the top of the table, before slipping to 3rd with a loss to the Melbourne Storm on the final round of the normal season. The club eventually went on to win the competition for the first time in their history after triumphing over both the Canberra Raiders and the Melbourne Storm. 2017 saw the club finish 5th with 15 wins and 9 losses across the season, with a number of players reaching milestones with the club, with Paul Gallen, Luke Lewis and Chris Heighington reaching 300 NRL matches throughout their careers. The 2017 season also saw players of the Grand Final squad who were key to winning the competition the previous season depart at the end of the season, with Jack Bird heading to the Brisbane Broncos and James Maloney traded to the Penrith Panthers for Matt Moylan. The 2018 season saw the club finish 4th, tied on points with the three other clubs above them. New additions to the team included Josh Dugan, Matt Moylan and Scott Sorensen, as well as Trent Hodkinson who would go on to leave midway during the season to join up with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. Heading into the finals series, allegations were made that the club may have been in breach of the salary cap during the 2015 and 2017 seasons by The Daily Telegraph, which was later confirmed to be true by the club after admitting that they had self-reported themselves to the NRL several months earlier after coming under new leadership. Having finished 4th, the Sharks were to play the minor premiers, and eventual winners of the competition, the Sydney Roosters, going down 21 to 12. The match also saw Wade Graham depart the field with an ACL tear which would rule him out for the rest of the series and for part of the 2019 season. Their Semi-Final matchup with the Penrith Panthers saw them win by a single field goal, kicked by Chad Townsend to give them the lead at 21‚Äì20, despite having led the Panthers at half-time 18 to 2. Their next match against the Melbourne Storm saw them lose to the eventual runners-up 22 to 6. Due to the loss, the match marked the end of Luke Lewis' playing career, with the player having announced his retirement earlier in the season. The match also threatened to end Storm legend Billy Slater's playing career, with the player - having also announced retirement during the season - performing an alleged illegal shoulder charge and therefore professional foul on Sharks winger Sosaia Feki who was in the act of scoring. Despite being penalised for the action, Slater managed to avoid both the Sin Bin and a suspension, with the NRL judiciary controversially ruling his tackle not a shoulder charge. Supplements scandal The beginning of the 2013 NRL Season saw the Sharks investigated by ASADA (Australian Sports Anti- Doping Agency) and reports led back to Sports scientist Stephen Dank who Shane Flanagan and Trainer Trent Elkin introduced to the club, and statements that he had administered peptides to a number of Sharks players. The investigations resulted in the sacking of four of the Cronulla Sharks' staff members for their involvement and cover up. They were Darren Mooney, Mark Noakes, David Giveny and Konrad Schultz. Flanagan was stood down from his coaching duties in 2014 before guiding the Sharks to the finals series in 2015. The Sharks finished the 2013 season in 5th place on the ladder, before winning their first finals game in a controversial 20‚Äì18 victory over the Cowboys. They went down the following week 24‚Äì18 to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles to bow out of premiership contention. Cronulla were commended for their bravery throughout the whole of the season by not letting off-field distractions (namely the ASADA investigation) deter their on-field performances, however 2014 proved to be a different story, with interim coaches and player injury and suspension seeing the club finish the year with the Wooden Spoon. 2016: First Premiership The 2016 season started with a 20‚Äì14 loss over 2015 premiers, North Queensland Cowboys. This was followed by a 30‚Äì2 win over the St. George Illawarra Dragons and a loss to Manly-Warringah, 22‚Äì12. The Sharks then went on to win 15 games in a row from Round 4 against the Melbourne Storm to Round 21, against the Gold Coast Titans, resulting in an 18-all draw. This was the largest win streak in the club's history. During this period the Sharks equaled their largest win score by defeating the Newcastle Knights 62‚Äì0. They then went on to win 1 out of their last 5 games resulting in a drop from 1st to 3rd. In round 26, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and Melbourne Storm faced off in a minor premiership showdown in which the Melbourne Storm won 26‚Äì6 in AAMI Park. They went on to defeat the Raiders in the Week 1 qualifying final 16-14 and earning the week off. Advancing to the Preliminary final, they defeated defending premiers North Queensland Cowboys 32‚Äì20 at the Sydney Football Stadium. They would face and defeat the Melbourne Storm in the 2016 NRL Grand Final. The Sharks, after leading 8‚Äì0 at half-time, prevailed in a gripping affair 14‚Äì12 to claim their first premiership in the club's 50-year history. Sharks second rower Luke Lewis was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as Man of the Match. Soon after the Maiden premiership victory star player Ben Barba tested positive for Cocaine and was sacked from the club. Chairman Damien Keogh who rose to the position on a platform of commercial experience garnered from his role as CEO of HOYTS Australia, was also arrested for possession of Cocaine whilst in Sydney's CBD and was stood down and removed from the position of Sharks Chairman as a result. They were also embroiled in a salary cap scandal and it was found they were cheating the salary cup during the 2016 premiership season. Although they were not stripped of the premiership they were fined and had to play with a reduced salary cap for the next few season. The salary cap issues that were found that season have placed a cloud over their only premiership win in club history because they were cheating the salary cap. 2017: World Club Challenge The Sharks played Wigan Warriors at the DW Stadium on 19 February 2017, losing 22‚Äì6 to a strong Wigan side.

The furthest advance of Finnish units in the Continuation War and borders for both before and after the Winter War are shown. Finnish soldiers in Olonets The Finnish invasion of East Karelia was a military campaign in 1941. It was part of the Continuation War. Finnish troops occupied East Karelia and held it until 1944. For over a month after the outbreak of the Continuation War, the Karelian Army reinforced and prepared to resume its earlier offensive while waiting for the recapture of the Karelian Isthmus. The Soviets had prepared fortifications and brought troops to the front. When encirclements on the western shore of Lake Ladoga were resolved, the Finnish 7th Division was transferred to the junction of VI and VII Corps. Preparations and plans Finnish 14th Division under command of Colonel Erkki Raappana operated under direct command of the Finnish HQ started its advance on 4 July. It was the northernmost Finnish unit south of the demarcation line between Finnish and German forces. It was opposed by elements of the Soviet 54th Rifle Division. It encircled and mauled the defending Soviet 337th Rifle Regiment at Omelia and kept advancing towards its goal of Rukaj√§rvi and Ontajoki River. The advance was halted by Mannerheim on September 17 after the 14th Division had reached its goals. While the earlier offensive in Ladoga Karelia by the Finnish VI Corps of the Karelian Army had been successful the same didn't apply to all Finnish attempts. The advance of Group Oinonen had bogged down almost immediately and the VII Corps had been completely occupied in clearing the encircled Soviet forces from the Sortavala area. While the Finnish command had stopped the offensive that did not prevent local commanders from preparing for further attacks. This meant repairing roads and railroad tracks leading to the front lines. The left flank of the Karelian Army also received permission to capture tactical jumping-off positions. Group Oinonen and the 11th Division of the Finnish VII Corps were ordered to capture the Suvilahti-Suoj√§rvi region. The attack was launched on August 19 and forced the Soviet 71st Rifle Division holding the area to withdraw already on 21 August. The Finns pressed on and captured Tsalkki village and crossroads on 23 August. Increased pressure allowed the Finns to advance and reach the eastern edge of the lake S√§√§m√§j√§rvi on September 1. Finnish plan for the offensive that was to begin on September 4 had the VI Corps advance from its current positions near the lake Ladoga to south-east and reach the Svir River while the VII Corps would first take the important crossroads of Pr√§√§s√§ and then continue to Petrozavodsk. This offensive was believed to be much more difficult than the previous Finnish offensives due to the relatively unfamiliar terrain, wide front of advance and the expectation that Soviet reinforcements would be sent to protect the Murmansk railway. Order of battle Finnish forces consisted of the units of the Karelian Army under Lieutenant General Erik Heinrichs. Furthest to the south was the VI Corps under Major General Paavo Talvela who had two divisions (5th and 17th divisions) in front line positions and Group L or Group Lagus (consisting of 1st J√§ger Brigade and certain elements of 5th Division) under Colonel Ruben Lagus as mobile reserve. At the center Finns had VII Corps under Major General Woldemar H√§gglund who initially had two divisions (1st and 11th divisions) under his command but was soon reinforced with the 7th Division. Further to the north Finns had Major General Woldemar Oinonen's Group Oinonen together with German 163rd Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Erwin Engelbrecht. Furthest to the north was the roughly brigade strong Group K or Group Kuussaari under Lieutenant Colonel Eero Kuussaari. Soviet forces consisted of forces of the Soviet 7th Army under Lieutenant General Filipp Gorelenko which had been split into two operational groups. Olonets Operational Group was located to the south and Petrozavodsk Operational Group at the center. Olonets Operational Group consisted of recently formed Soviet 3rd Militia Division with 3rd Naval Rifle Brigade held in reserve but was soon reinforced with 314th Rifle Division. Petrozavodsk Operational Group consisted of 272nd Rifle Division with 313th Rifle Division being held as reserve. Soviet 71st Rifle Division defended the area further to the north. Start of the offensive The Finnish offensive started on the early hours of September 4 at Tuloksa, when the largest artillery barrage so far in Finnish history was unleashed. Finnish 5th Division quickly broke through the Soviet defenses and crossed the Tuloksa river. Once engineers had hastily built a pontoon bridge the mechanized Group L raced eastwards. The defending Soviet forces consisting of Soviet 3rd Marine Brigade and supporting infantry regiments were forced to retreat or ended up encircled by the advancing Finnish forces. Group L used the mobility it had due to its usage of motor vehicles and captured Olonets already on September 5. Soviet attempts to reform for the defense was hindered by the fact that most of the forces now consisted of broken-up units. Finnish 5th and 17th divisions also started their offensive towards the village of Nurmoila which was defended by the Soviet 3rd Militia Division. By attacking from both south and north the Finns forced the defending Soviets to withdraw towards east despite of the field fortifications Soviets had constructed to the area. Soviet withdrawal however prevented Finns from closing the trap they had prepared for the Soviets and on September 7 a strong infantry contingent together with the divisional HQ of the Soviet 3rd Militia Division managed to escape via forest paths though without any heavy equipment. Finnish advance by Group L reached Svir river by September 7 near the town of Lodeynoye Pole. On the same day detachment from 17th Division cut the Murmansk railroad. Finns pressed on and captured railroad bridge over the Svir river at Svirstroy on September 13. By September 22 Finnish VI Corps had already advanced south of Svir capturing Podporozhye and taken defensive positions. Finnish bridgehead was at this point approximately 40 km wide and 5‚Äì10 km deep. Finnish 5th Division took positions on the northern shore of Svir river reaching to the mouth of the river while the Finnish 17th Division manned the bridgehead south of Svir River. Capture of Petrozavodsk The Finnish 11th Division's advance towards Pryazha (Pr√§√§s√§) met strong Soviet resistance but was able to advance through the forests and encircle the defending Soviets. The advance was however slow and it took until September 5 before the road leading to Petrozavodsk was cut by the Finnish forces. Encircled Soviet units made repeated counterattacks against the Finnish roadblock but failed to clear it. Steadily advancing the Finnish 11th Division captured Pryazha on September 8. Meanwhile, the Finnish 1st Division advanced towards the village of Pyh√§j√§rvi directly south of Pryazha. By September 16 Finnish 1st Division had reached the southern end of Pyh√§j√§rvi while the Finnish 7th Division had looped around the defending Soviet forces. After suffering heavy casualties the surrounded Soviet forces escaped through the forest after abandoning their heavy equipment. Finnish 11th Division continued its advance first to Polovina on September 24 and from there to the crossroads at Vilga on September 28, just 6 km from the suburbs of Petrozavodsk. The Soviets realized early on that holding Petrozavodsk against the Finns advancing towards the town from both west and south was going to be a costly effort. In an attempt to do that the Soviets formed several new formations from NKVD units, broken-up or separated army units and from reinforcements. These included 37th Rifle Division as well as 1st Light Infantry Brigade. The Finns also brought in reinforcements in the form of the 4th Division that was sent to advance along the road leading from Lake Syamozero towards Petrozavodsk. By 14 September it had already met fierce Soviet resistance but the numerically superior Finnish forces managed to encircle and defeat the defending Soviet 313th Rifle Division which was forced to retreat after suffering heavy casualties however the clearing of the last of the mottis took until September 26. Elements of the Finnish 4th Division continued their advance with the intent of cutting the road leading north from the Petrozavodsk. The Finns captured the village of Markkila on 19 September but couldn't breach the Soviet 313th Division's defense at Besovets (Viitana) despite repeated attempts. While the Finnish 4th Division was unable to complete its mission of cutting off the Soviet forces defending Petrozavodsk region it did tie up a considerable amount of Soviet forces and protected the only vulnerable flank of the Finnish advance. Group L had been advancing north-east from Svir but the advance was slower than expected due to the heavy autumn rains that turned roads into quagmires. By September the advance had reached the village of Ladva where Group L met with Finnish 7th Division and together the Finnish units encircled and then defeated the defending Soviet 3rd Militia Division. Elements of the Group L pressed on and reached the shores of lake Onega on September 23 and cut the route south from Petrozavodsk. The Finnish advance had pressed the defending Soviets into a small area in the vicinity of Petrozavodsk with the Soviet 313th Rifle Division keeping the sole remaining land route open. The advance of the Finnish 11th Division reached the town on 1 October but failed to close the escape route until on the following day. Meanwhile, the Finnish 1st Division which had been clearing mottis near Pryazha now reached the front and captured the town later on the same day. The fairly slow Finnish advance had however made it possible for several Soviet units to escape from the encirclement. The fall of Petrozavodsk also broke down the resistance in the south from where Group L had been approaching the town. Finnish 4th Division also finally broke through of the Soviet defenses at Besovets leaving Petrozavodsk firmly in Finnish hands. The town was promptly renamed as '√Ñ√§nislinna' ('castle of Onega') by the Finns. While most of the Finnish forces in the area had been concentrating on the capture of Petrozavodsk elements of the Finnish 7th Division had advanced along the coast of Onega lake to the mouth of the Svir river. Attempts to cross the river on October 6 failed due to fatigue and the men's refusal to cross the river. Renewed attempt on the following day in bright daylight was successful. The rest of the division followed soon after. This allowed merging of the bridgehead with the one created earlier in the offensive. A Finnish attempt to gain ideal defensive ground came to an end at Oshta when the Finnish troops encountered fresh Soviet 114th Rifle Division. Neither side could gain advantage in the fighting that followed and the Finnish forces started to prepare for defense in the bridgehead south of the Svir. Finnish bridgehead south of Svir was expanded to 100 km in width and 20 km in depth. Continued offensive Capture of the town of Medvezhyegorsk (Karhum√§ki) was set the goal for the continued Finnish offensive. Troops advancing from various directions towards the town were reformed as II Corps consisting of Finnish 4th Division, Group O, Brigade (or Group) K and were further reinforced with 8th Division that was transferred from the Karelian Isthmus. Opposing them was the Soviet operative group consisting of 37th, 71st and 313th Rifle Divisions which were all under strength. The Finns advanced along two routes: a larger group following the road from Petrozavodsk towards Medvezhyegorsk; and a smaller group following the road from Porosozero (Poraj√§rvi) towards Paatene (at south-western end of the lake Segozero). After reaching Paatene advancing Finnish forces were able to form lines of communication to the Finnish 14th Division that had earlier reached Rugozero. Medvezhyegorsk was captured on December 5 by a three-pronged attacked and already on the following day the Finnish spearhead captured the town of Poventsa (Povenets). After Povenets had fallen to Finnish control the Red Army destroyed the locks of the Stalin Canal on December 8 which caused immediate flooding of Povenets. Damage from the flood was however largely superficial. Mannerheim had ordered previously that the advance of the Finnish forces would be halted to a line running from Povenets towards Lake Segozero so the capture of Povenets ended the Finnish offensive.

He was highly regarded amongst both European and American scholars, and known for his warmth and charm. Biography Le Braz was born in Saint-Servais, C√¥tes-d'Armor, and raised amongst woodcutters and charcoal burners, speaking the Breton language; his parents did not speak French. He spent his holidays in Tr√©gor, which inspired his later work. He began school aged 10 at Saint-Brieuc and progressed swiftly to a degree at the Sorbonne, where he studied for seven years. He then returned to Brittany, where for 14 years he taught at the Lyc√©e at Quimper and gradually translated old Breton songs into modern French, continuing the folklore work of Fran√ßois-Marie Luzel. He often entertained local peasants and fishermen in the old manor house where he lived, recording their songs and tales. His book, Chansons de la Bretagne (\\"Songs of Brittany\\"), was awarded a prize by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. In 1898, he became president of the Union r√©gionaliste bretonne formed in Morlaix following the Breton festivals. In 1899 he joined the Association des bleus de Bretagne. He was made lecturer and then professor in the Faculty of Arts at Rennes University between 1901 and 1924. Le Braz was sent on foreign cultural missions by the French Government twenty times. He made several visits to the US, Canada and Switzerland, lecturing at Harvard University in 1906, and at Columbia University in 1915. During his 1915 visit he married Henrietta S. Porter of Annapolis, who died in 1919. In 1921 he married Mabel Davison of Manhattan, sister of the famed banker Henry P. Davison. American novelist John Nichols is his great-grandson. He is the maternal great-grandfather of the musician Tina Weymouth and the architect Yann Weymouth along with their six siblings.Heritage-d'Anatole Le Braz aux talking heads dated August 31, 2012 at letelegramme.fr Le Braz died at Menton on the French Riviera. Mourners included the French prime minister, Aristide Briand. Memorials A number of memorials to Le Braz exist in Brittany.

The story revolved around a young South American girl who unexpectedly sprouts a pair of wings. She is kidnapped and taken to London, where her captors cash in by passing her off as an angel. Later she escapes, only to be arrested because of her appearance. She is further dehumanized by standing trial to determine if she is human at all. Chaplin began work in and around 1969 with his daughter Victoria in mind for the lead role. However, Victoria's abrupt marriage and his advanced age proved roadblocks and the film was never made. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance maintains that Chaplin script for The Freak \\"borrows many themes, ideas, and even phrases from his three previous films but is nevertheless an original story filled with marvelous Chaplin comedy touches\\". Vance, who interviewed Victoria Chaplin, believes The Freak \\"had strong potential for being a very moving‚Äîand fitting‚Äîswan song\\".Vance, Jeffrey (2003). Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema. New York: Harry N. Abrams, pg. 352. . Chaplin's memoir, My Life in Pictures (1974), describes The Freak as a work still in progress. He also mentioned his intent to make it in an interview on his 85th birthday in 1974. \\"I mean to make it someday\\", Chaplin writes in a caption alongside a photograph of Victoria in winged costume published in My Life in Pictures. No footage from the film is known to exist, though brief color footage of Victoria in wings can be seen in Charlie Chaplin ‚Äì Les ann√©es suisses (2003).

She was the first of a number of ships designed by William Francis Gibbs for the line, which did much to develop tourism in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1927 Matson commissioned its largest ship yet, the Malolo (flying fish) for the first-class luxury service between San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu. The Malolo and other Matson liners advertised superb public rooms, spacious cabins, swimming pools, a gymnasium, and a staff, including a hairdresser, to provide a high standard of service.Great Luxury Liners 1927‚Äì1954, A Photographic Record by William H. Miller, Jr. Malolo Malolo introduced improved safety standards which influenced all subsequent American passenger liners. On 25 May 1927 while on her sea trials in the western Atlantic, she collided with SS Jacob Christensen, a Norwegian freighter, with an impact equal to that when struck an iceberg and sank 15 years earlier. Malolos advanced watertight compartments allowed her to stay afloat and sail into New York Harbor flooded with over 7,000 tons of sea water in her hull.Brayard, By Their Works Ye Shall Know Them, 35‚Äì41. On 27 October 1927, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William S. Benson praised the design of the vessel, stating that it was thoroughly protected against submarines and torpedoes by the new arrangement of sub-division in her hull. :‚ÄùMoney spent on vessels of this class would not be idle during peace, and the ships would be valuable in time of war,‚Äù said the admiral, who was chief of naval operations during the Great War. Admiral Benson stated that he had been informed by marine engineering experts that the ramming incident suffered during her sea trials would have sunk almost any other merchant vessel. The officer accompanied Malolo from New York City as far as San Francisco on her maiden voyage to Honolulu. The 240 passengers aboard for her departure from the East Coast included Governor W. R. Farrington of Hawaii, and officials of the Matson line including William P. Roth, president.Associated Press, ‚ÄúAdmiral Gives Praise To New Hawaiian Ship - Benson Declares Merchant Vessel Is Suitable For War Uses,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 28 October 1927, Volume LXI, Number 58, page 1. Matsonia In 1937, Matson docked Malolo for a major refit. The lifeboats were moved two decks higher and the deck they vacated was enclosed to create additional berths including new \\"Lanai Suites\\". Existing cabins were greatly upgraded; the ship changed from a combination of 457 first class and 163 cabin class accommodations to 693 first class only. The transformed ship was rechristened Matsonia. =Wartime service= From early 1942 through April 1946 Matsonia was operated as a troop ship by the Matson Company as agent for the War Shipping Administration. With her duties as a troop ship completed in April 1946, she returned to commercial duties between San Francisco and Honolulu.https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/OnlineLibrary/photos/sh- civil/civsh-m/malolo.htm She made her final trip for the Matson Line in April 1948. When she arrived in Los Angeles Harbor from Hawaii 238 passengers disembarked, with 126 arriving at her final port of call in San Francisco on April 20. ‚ÄúCapt. William R. Meyer, Matsonia master, signed the last entry in her log - ‚Äúfinished with engines‚Äù - and turned the record over to Hugh Gallagher, operations Vice President of the line.‚ÄùAssociated Press, ‚ÄúLuxury Liner Matsonia Makes Final Voyage,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 21 April 1948, Volume LIV, Number 201, page 1. Atlantic and Queen Frederica After retirement by the Matson Line she was sold to Home Lines, which renamed her Atlantic and later Queen Frederica (after Queen Frederica of Greece) before being sold to Chandris Lines. After fifty years of service for several different companies, she was sold to Greek breakers in July 1977 and was towed to the breakers yards at Eleusina, Greece. In February 1978 while her interiors were being demolished she was gutted by fire and work was temporarily halted. Three years later her remaining hull sections could still be seen among other ships at the breakers' yard.

History Established in 1937, ATA is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit trade association of over 100 talent agencies located primarily in the New York and Los Angeles areas. Today, over 100 agencies that serve the various branches of the entertainment industry are members of the Association of Talent Agents.

This landmark piece of New Deal legislation, also known as the Wagner Act, guaranteed the right of private sector employees to unionize and bargain collectively, thus leading to the establishment of many of the unions and guilds that represent professionals working in the entertainment industry such as the Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America.

Power told the BBC that the exercise scenario included bombs going off at exactly the same stations as they actually did in the actual attacks. Power said that this coinciding of his exercise and the real attacks was a coincidence and was based on the previous terrorist incidents in London, including 18 bombs already detonated on the London Underground since 1885 (see Attacks on the London Underground). An investigation by the BBC series The Conspiracy Files identified the client Power's company worked for that day delivering a simulation exercise. It examined allegations about his company and others, involved in an alleged UK government \\"cover-up\\" similar to 9/11 conspiracy theories.

She is Professor Emerita in the Department of Communication at the University of California, San Diego. Career Her first film, Children Make Movies (1961), was about a film- making project at Lillian Wald's Henry Street Settlement in Lower Manhattan. Her film, Mural on Our Street was nominated for an Academy Award in 1965. She has led media workshops with elementary school children, reform school youth, senior citizens and migrant farmers. In 1976 she was co-director of the Child- Made Film Symposium, which was a fifteen-year assessment of media by youth throughout the world. She has served as a trustee of the American Film Institute, Women Make Movies and the Instructional Telecommunications Foundation. She has authored numerous articles in Film Library Quarterly, Film Culture, High Performance, The Independent, Leonardo, Afterimage and other media journals. Her book, Hand Held Visions: the Impossible Possibilities of Community Media is published by Fordham University Press. She co-edited Public Broadcasting and the Public Interest with M.E. Sharpe, and has written essays for a number of collections on independent media. In 1989 she received a Guggenheim Fellowship for an ecological series for the Deep Dish Network. She received two Rockefeller Media Fellowships for The Gringo in Ma√±analand, a compilation film about stereotypes of Latin Americans in U.S. films, which was featured at the Venice Film Festival, the London Film Festival and won a special jury prize at the Trieste Festival for Latin American Film and first prize from the American Anthropological Association's Visual Anthropology Division in 1998. Ah! The Hopeful Pageantry of Bread and Puppet. made in 2000 in collaboration with Tamar Schumann, was shown at the Woodstock Film Festival, The PDX Experimental Film Festival in Portland, Oregon, the Vermont Film Festival and the Dallas Video Festival. She has received five awards for lifetime achievement: an Indy from the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers, The George C. Stoney Award from the Alliance for Community Media (ACM); The Life Time Achievement Award of the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC), the Herbert Schiller Award from the 2003 Schmio Awards and the 2007 Dallas Smythe Award from the Union for Democratic Communication. She has co-coordinated Paper Tiger installations at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Austrian Triennial of Photography in Graz, the Wexner Center in Columbus Ohio, the Gallery at the San Francisco Art Institute and the Berkeley Art Museum. In 1990, before the first Gulf War started, she worked with a team of Paper Tiger and Deep Dish producers to create a series on the impending war, called The Gulf Crisis TV Project which ultimately produced ten half-hour programs which were widely shown on Public-access television stations, film festivals, the Whitney Museum, Channel Four in the UK and NHK in Japan. Her work with Deep Dish TV includes a twelve part series on the prison industrial complex in the United States entitled, Bars and Stripes (1996) and Shocking and Awful, (2004-2005) a thirteen part series on the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq. She is currently finishing a four-hour compilation of speeches and interviews from the World Tribunal on Iraq, which Deep Dish filmed in Istanbul in June 2005. Halleck has been closely involved with the Independent Media Center movement, which now totals over 180 centers in sixty countries. She was one of the initial group of media activists that developed the first center in Seattle during the World Trade Organization protests. Her role was to develop the initial funding proposal for the center, raise funds from individual donors and organize 5 days of satellite broadcasting from that historic event. That work evolved into the television version of Democracy Now!, the Pacifica Network daily radio news series. After retiring from the University of California in 2001, Halleck worked full-time for a year (on a volunteer basis) to create the infrastructure and resources for Democracy Now! television, building on the contacts already established by Deep Dish. This daily news program is now on over 650 community television and radio stations and on the Dish Network of 15 million subscribers via Freespeech TV. As President of the Association of Independent Video and Film Makers (AIVF) in the nineteen seventies, Halleck led a media reform campaign in Washington, testifying twice before the House Sub-Committee on Telecommunication for increased support and channel space for independent video and film. This work ultimately lead to the creation of ITVS, the Independent Television Service. Halleck‚Äôs work in media reform includes working with a coalition of national organizations to insure public interest set-asides for Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS). That successful campaign created the provisions which have allowed Free Speech TV, Link TV and a number of universities to have 24-hour television networks via satellite. Halleck has been involved in media policy reform on the international level as a member of the MacBride Roundtable on Communication, Communication Rights in the Information Society (CRIS) and as an official delegate to the World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva 2003 and in Tunis in 2005.

Date and authorship Scholars have dated the play to c. 1614, based on allusions to contemporary events -- notably to the dragon that was reportedly seen in Sussex in August 1614.Maxwell, p. 194. The early editions of the play assign it to Beaumont and Fletcher, but scholars who have studied the play since the nineteenth century agree that Beaumont is absent from the work; \\"All investigators are agreed in giving the play to Fletcher\\" alone.Oliphant, p. 150. Some critics, however, have argued that the text was revised, perhaps around 1620, a light revision which nonetheless removed Fletcher's characteristic preference for ye as against you.Maxwell, pp. 195-209.Logan and Smith, p. 66. Publication The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 25 April 1639, as a solo work by Fletcher, and was published in quarto later that year, the text printed by Thomas Cotes for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke. The title page of the first edition states that the play was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre; and the play later passed to Beeston's Boys. Given these facts, it is most likely that the play was originally performed by the Lady Elizabeth's Men.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 29. Andrew Crooke issued another quarto edition in 1661. The play was included in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679. After 1642 Wit Without Money is one of the few plays known to have been performed during the English Civil War and the Interregnum period, 1642-60, when the London theatres were formally closed but operated when they could (an early form of \\"guerilla theatre\\"). The play was staged at the Red Bull Theatre on 3 February 1648; unable to sell tickets openly, the actors had tickets thrown into the gentry's coaches.Sprague, pp. 3-4. Another performance, on 29 December 1654, was broken up by the authorities. The play was revived during the Restoration era,Sprague, pp. 10, 12, 15, and ff. like many of the works in Fletcher's canon and was performed at Middle Temple in 1660Middle Temple Archive: MT/2/TRB/18, Treasurer's receipt book, 1659-1660, bill 117. A production at the King's Playhouse in London was \\"not enjoyed much\\" by Samuel Pepys (Diary, 22 April 1663). John Dryden wrote a Prologue for a 1672 revival. (The King's Company's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane burned down in January 1672; they moved to the theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields and debuted there with Wit Without Money on 26 February 1672.) The play was adapted to meet changing tastes; an altered version was printed in an undated edition that probably appeared about 1708.Potter, p. 16. In fact the play seems to have been more popular in the 18th century than it was during the Restoration period, being regularly performed through the 1760s and as late as 1782.Griswold, p. 121. Melville In the next century, Herman Melville chose one of the epigraphs in his collection The Encantadas from this play. For the third epigraph to \\"Sketch Sixth,\\" the story \\"Barrington Isle and the Buccaneers,\\" Melville slightly misquotes, or adapts for his own purposes, Valentine's \\"How bravely now I live, how jocund, how near the first inheritance, without fears, how free from title-troubles!\\" from Act I, scene i. Melville marked the relevant passage in his personal copy of the 1679 folio. Synopsis Valentine is a young gentleman who has wasted his estate; in what seems overt and willful irresponsibility, he has mortgaged his lands to live the life of a fashionable man about town. His Uncle tries to persuade him to behave more responsibly, to do something to repair his fortunes -- even to the extreme of marrying a wealthy woman; but Valentine will not listen. Valentine has not only imperiled his own future, but has squandered the resources that provided an annuity to his younger brother Francisco. Valentine has fallen in with a trio of suitors, Fountain, Bellamore, and Hairbrain, who court the wealthy widow Lady Hartwell; but Valentine refuses to follow their examples, much to his Uncle's displeasure. Instead, Valentine uses his considerable wit and verbosity to slander widows, marriage, and women in general. Lady Hartwell's younger sister Isabella happens to catch sight of Francisco, and instantly falls in love with him. Her maid Luce informs Lady Hartwell of Isabella's infatuation; and the Lady, unhappy at the poor prospect of Francisco as a brother-in-law, decides to prevent a match between them by packing up her household and leaving London for her country estate. Her plan is delayed when Valentine gets her coachman too drunk to drive. This provokes a confrontation between Valentine and Lady Hartwell; he employs his usual slanders and screeds against her, but is astonished when she stands her ground and equals him, indeed betters him, in a battle of words and wits. Afterward, it is clear that the Lady is interested in the provoking gentleman. Isabella sends a purse full of coin to Francisco, anonymously, through her sister's follower Shorthose; but the young man tracks down the source and seeks her out to thank her in person. She, however, is too proud and shy to acknowledge her feelings openly. It is only when Francisco confronts her by surprise on her way to church that they reach an understanding. Valentine and Lady Hartwell have a similar problem. Valentine's Uncle tries to force them past their standstill: he congratulates the Lady on her marriage to his nephew, and even suggests that she is already pregnant by him. Lady Hartwell goes to Valentine to confront him about this; from arguing they fall to flirting, then courting, and finally agree to marry. By the play's end, both pairs, the two brothers and the sisters, are joined together. Written mostly in prose instead of verse, Wit Without Money resembles another Fletcher comedy, The Elder Brother.

An American-Canadian production, it is based on the novel The Repossession Mambo by Eric Garcia, and follows a repo man who goes on the run after he becomes the recipient of an artificial heart and finds himself suffering the same fate as his victims. The film was theatrically released on 19 March 2010. Plot In 2025, advancements in medical technology have perfected bio-mechanical organs. A corporation known as The Union sells these expensive \\"artiforgs\\" on credit, and when customers are unable or unwilling to pay for their artiforgs The Union sends \\"repo men\\" to locate and forcibly repossess the organ - invariably resulting in the death of the owner. Remy (Jude Law) and his partner, Jake Freivald (Forest Whitaker), are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Remy allows Jake to discreetly perform a repossession nearby, but is caught by Carol who leaves with Peter in anger. While patrolling with Jake, the duo discovers a \\"nest\\", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and are attempting to escape the country. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves, impressing their boss, Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy declines and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg. Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake. As he tries to go back to work, he realizes he's developed sympathy for the customers, unable to lie when he tries sales, but also unable to kill when repossessing their artiforgs. He's soon unable to make the payments on his heart and is in debt. Jake discovers that Remy has not been repossessing and takes him to a \\"nest\\" with enough artiforgs to clear his debt; however, Remy cannot do the job. Furious, Jake demands he stay there until he gets over his inhibition. A stunned debtor wakes up and knocks Remy out. Waking up, Remy encounters Beth, a singer he would see while drinking in a bar with Jake. He takes her to a motel room and discovers she has numerous artiforgs. Breaking into the office, Remy attempts to clear Beth's and his own accounts, but he is interrupted by Jake, who lets him leave. On the run, Beth and Remy leave for the abandoned outskirts of the city. Beth tells Remy of how she contracted various diseases and was involved in a car crash, and was forced to resort to buying artiforgs on the black market after running up severe debts. They begin a relationship, and Remy decides to document his life as a repo man with an old typewriter Beth found. As he works on a manuscript, he is interrupted by a repo man. Remy sets a trap and the collector drops through a hole in the floor. Beth falls through the same hole, damaging her prosthetic knee. Before the collector can shoot Beth, Remy manages to kill him. Remy sneaks into his former workplace to obtain scanning jammers he had confiscated during his raid on the nest. He attempts to force Frank to clear his account, only to discover that accounts can now only be cleared at the Union's central office due to his earlier attempt. Remy and Beth attempt to flee the country at the airport, but security is alerted by bleeding from Beth's knee. A fight with airport security ensues. Jake arrives, but is on the wrong side of a security panel and watches their escape. They go to a black market doctor to replace Beth's knee. After the procedure, they are stopped by Jake who tries to convince Remy to rejoin him as a repo man. Remy refuses, and Jake reveals he rigged the defibrillator unit that caused his heart to fail, so Remy would continue to work with him. They fight, and Jake knocks Remy unconscious. Beth awakens Remy, saying she stunned Jake as an organ repossession raid is underway. They flee to an underground residence where Remy is subdued by a freedom fighter (Yvette Nicole Brown). Later Remy decides to delete the accounts of all implant clients. Remy meets Carol and Peter on a train one last time, passing on his manuscript to Peter. Remy and Beth break into Union headquarters and are forced to fight their way through the facility to the Union's database. Using Beth's prosthetic eye, they enter and seal themselves inside as Jake and Frank arrive. The server's only interface is an organ scanner, requiring Remy and Beth to cut themselves open to use the scanner internally on each of their artiforgs, clearing their accounts. Frank and Jake enter the server room using an artiforg from one of the slain repo men, finding Beth near death and Remy attempting to scan her heart. Jake is ordered to kill Remy, but he instead kills Frank and helps revive Beth. Jake tosses two grenades into the artiforg drawer of the server, with the explosion destroying the mainframe, wiping the records of everyone who has an account with the Union. Later, Remy is seen on a tropical beach, enjoying his freedom with Beth and Jake. His text has been published as a book, The Repossession Mambo. While Remy talks to Jake, he notices that Jake suddenly disappears, leaving Remy's book on his chair; then Remy sees the beach flicker with static before returning to normal. It is revealed that Remy is in a coma, having sustained severe brain damage when Jake knocked him unconscious. Jake has paid off Remy's debt for his heart and also paid to link his brain to a neural network, allowing him to live out his life peacefully in a computer generated dream world. Beth is unconscious, and Jake says he will take care of her; he then says a sorrowful goodbye to Remy. The film ends with Frank delivering a sales pitch for the neural network.

Life He was born in Stockport, Cheshire in 1836. His father, John Ashe (d. 1879), originally a Manchester manufacturer and an amateur artist, resolved late in life to take holy orders, was prepared for ordination by his own son, and became vicar of St. Paul's at Crewe in 1869. Thomas was educated at Stockport Grammar School and St. John's College, Cambridge, where he entered as a sizar in 1855 and graduated B.A. as senior optime in 1859. He took up scholastic work in Peterborough, was ordained deacon in 1859 and priest in 1860; at Easter 1860 he became curate of Silverstone, Northamptonshire. But clerical work proved distasteful, and he gave himself entirely to schoolmastering. In 1865 he became mathematical and modern form master at Leamington College, whence he moved to a similar post at Queen Elizabeth's School, Ipswich. Here he became a major influence on Charles Sherrington. He remained there nine years. After two years in Paris he finally settled in London in 1881. Here he was engaged in editing Samuel Taylor Coleridge's works. The poems appeared in the 'Aldine Series' of poets in 1885. Three volumes of prose were published in Bohn's 'Standard Library'; Lecture and Notes on Shakspere in 1883', Table Talk and Omniana in 1884, and in Miscellanies, Aesthetic and Literary, in 1885. Ashe died in London on 18 Dec 1889, but was buried in St. James's Churchyard, Sutton, Macclesfield; a portrait is given in the Illustrated London News and in The Eagle (xvi. 109). Ashe was a poet of considerable charm. He wrote steadily from his college days to the end of his life; but, although his powers were recognized by some of the literary journals, his poems failed entirely to gain the ear of his generation.

History The second U.S. Navy ship named for the waxbill bird, the ship was originally the wooden-hulled, unnamed motor minesweeper YMS-479. Laid down as PCS-1456 on 28 April 1943 at Tacoma, Washington, by the Mojean and Ericson Shipbuilding Corp., the ship was reclassified as a motor minesweeper, YMS-479, on 27 September 1943. Launched on 30 September 1943, YMS-479 was commissioned at the Mojean and Ericson yard on 20 July 1944, Lt. Richard A. Woods, USNR, in command. After fitting out at the Todd Pacific Shipyard, Tacoma, Washington, the new minecraft departed the Seattle, Washington, area on 13 August. Making port at Long Beach, California, on 17 August, she conducted shakedown out of that port until 8 September, when she shifted to San Diego, California, for training in antisubmarine warfare tactics. She departed San Diego on 25 September, when she sailed with as screen for tank landing ships , , and , bound for the Hawaiian Islands. After arriving at the Section Base, Pearl Harbor, on 6 October, YMS-479 had begun patrolling off Kauai by the end of the month. She operated in the Hawaiian chain through February 1945, providing local escort services for ships conducting maneuvers and exercises off Maui, Kauai, or Oahu, ranging from attack transports to LSTs. During that time, she also carried out patrols and periodically tested her sweep gear. Assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet on 6 March, the motor minesweeper departed Pearl Harbor on 23 March, bound for the Marshall Islands. She subsequently operated out of Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Majuro through the end of the Pacific War in mid-August 1945. Departing Kwajalein on 10 December, YMS-479 arrived at Pearl Harbor on Christmas Day and subsequently operated in the Hawaiian Islands into 1946. Departing Pearl Harbor on 20 February in company with , YMS-479 arrived at San Francisco, California, on 1 March and began preparations for inactivation. YMS-479 was accordingly decommissioned on 6 August 1946 and was placed in the San Diego group of the Reserve Fleet. Named USS Waxbill and reclassified as AMS-39 on 18 February 1947 while still in reserve, the minecraft was taken out of \\"mothballs\\" on 5 January 1949; and work began to ready her to resume duty. On 19 January, Waxbill was placed \\"in service\\" and, within a week, she was assigned to the 13th Naval District. She served as a U.S. Naval Reserve training ship, attached to the Navy and Marine Corps Training Center at Seattle, Washington, where she served through the spring of 1950. With the onset of the Korean War in June and consequent American support for the United Nations intervention to aid the embattled South Koreans, the Navy expanded accordingly. Waxbill was recommissioned, albeit \\"in reserve,\\" on 1 September 1950. Ultimately, she was placed in full commission on 25 September, Lt. (jg.) F. J. Crozier in command. Duty in the inhospitable Korean waters soon beckoned Waxbill. The minecraft departed San Diego, California, on 27 February 1951, bound for the Far East. After stopovers at Pearl Harbor and the Japanese ports of Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan, Waxbill commenced her tour of Korean War service on 12 May in operation area \\"S\\". She participated in combat minesweeping operations off Wonsan, Pusan, Inchon, Kyoshin Tan, and To Jang Po into 1953. Her operations took her to both coasts of the Korean peninsula‚Äîeast and west‚Äîand she swept over 40 mines, earning the Korean Presidential Unit Citation for her often hazardous and unsung mine-sweeping chores. During that time, she operated out of Sasebo and, in between deployments to Korean waters, visited such Japanese ports as Kobe, Nagasaki, Yokosuka, Moji, and Fukuoka. Waxbill remained in the Far East even after hostilities in Korea ceased. She was reclassified as coastal minehunter AMCU-50 on 1 February 1955, and, only six days later, again reclassified MHC-50. After her conversion to a coastal minehunter, she departed Yokosuka, Japan, on 10 August, bound for the United States. Sailing via Midway Island, Pearl Harbor, and Long Beach, California, Waxbill made port at San Francisco, California, on 8 September. She operated off the coast of southern California into 1958, visiting, in the course of that deployment, such ports as Santa Cruz, San Francisco, and San Diego. Placed \\"in commission, in reserve,\\" status on 1 May 1958, Waxbill was placed in the Stockton, California, group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, on 16 May, and was ultimately placed out of commission, in reserve, on 30 June 1958. While exact details of the ship's ultimate fate are lacking, it is known that Waxbill was struck from the Navy list on 1 November 1959.  Awards and honors  Waxbill received six battle stars and was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for Korean War service.

The administrative centre of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation is Pelican Narrows. They are a Woodland Cree First Nation. Government Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation is governed by an Indian Act Chief and Council, elected for three year terms under the 2014 Election Code. In 2003 and 2004, work in amending the Election Act was undertaken by staff and a Cree speaking lawyer. PBCN membership consultations were done through utilization of community committees and staff for many months. Membership at the time did a remarkable job in updating the 1994 Band Custom Election Act. However, the proposed 2004 Election Act did not pass the referendum process with 2 communities rejecting the new election act. In August 2013, Chief and Council acquired funding from Indian Northern Affairs of Canada to begin the process again of amending the existing Election Act of 1994. Due to limited funding from the INAC, Chief and Council had suggested the work done in 2003 and 2004 be revisited and taken back to the membership for further consultations and amendments. The work to amend the 1994 Election Act started in early September 2013. The first round of community meetings with the membership were completed on October 23, 2013. It was expected that the process would be fast-paced in order to meet the amendment deadline date. A tentative date to hold a band wide referendum was slated for January 30, or early February 2014. The governance workers, Randy Clarke, Loretta Ballantyne, the band lawyer and other staff used input collected from technology such as surveys and the PBCN website as well as the community meetings to gather input from communities. After this process, the first draft of the 2014 Election Act was produced after it had been reviewed by the PBCN lawyer. The last round of consultations took place early December 2013 and it was passed in 2014 through a referendum. It was the membership of PBCN who decided on what amendments would be included in the election code, therefore, it was easily passed by the people. There are 14 elected councilors, two each from Southend, Sandy Bay, and Deschambault Lake, five from Pelican Narrows, and one each from Amisk Lake (Denare Beach), Sturgeon Landing, and Prince Albert. The centralized Government of the First Nation is located in Prince Albert, Sk. The current elected chief is Peter A. Beatty. Beatty was previously an elected councillor from Deschambault Lake, Saskatchewan and had been for 10 consecutive 2 year terms. He was first elected in 2013, when he beat former Chief Harold Linklater in a 2-person election for chief of the 11,000 strong PBCN on April 17, 2013 winning by a convincing margin of over 400 votes. Former Chief Darrel McCallum declined to seek re-election after 3 consecutive terms. That same year, 11 of the 14 councillor seats were also won by new candidates and only 3 incumbents retained their seats. In April 2018 incumbent Chief Beatty easily defeated several other candidates to retain his position for another 3-year term. Next election is April 2021. =Past leaders= *2013-2018: Peter A.

Beall also took classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.Lester Beall: Trailblazer of American Graphic Design, pp. 15-19, R. Roger Remington, 1996, Norton. After a short period of experimentation and professional work in Chicago, Beall moved to New York in 1935. The following year he established his home/office in Wilton, Connecticut. According to his online AIGA biography by R. Roger Remington: \\"Through the 1930s and 1940s Beall produced innovative and highly regarded work for clients including the Chicago Tribune, Sterling Engraving, The Art Directors Club of New York, Hiram Walker, Abbott Laboratories and Time magazine. Of particular interest was his work for the Crowell Publishing Company which produced Colliers magazine. The promotional covers \\"Will There Be War?\\" and \\"Hitler's Nightmare\\" are powerful designs which distill messages of the time. In these works he utilizes angled elements, iconic arrows, silhouetted photographs and dynamic shapes, all of which captures the essence of his personal style of the late 1930s. Also of interest in this period are the remarkable poster series for the United States government's Rural Electrification Administration.\\"  Legacy and death  His clear and concise use of typography was highly praised both in the United States and abroad. Throughout his career he used bold primary colors and illustrative arrows and lines in a graphic style that became easily recognizable as his own. He eventually moved to rural New York and set up an office, and home, at a premises that he and his family called \\"Dumbarton Farm\\". He remained at the farm until his death in 1969. In May 2007 Swann Galleries in New York set an auction record price for Beall's 1939 photomontage poster promoting the Rural Electrification Administration's campaign to bring electricity to rural America. The image at right‚Äîconsidered one of the greatest American posters of all time‚Äîfeatures a young boy and girl smiling and looking to the future as they lean against the wood fence bordering their farm. It sold for $38,400. References * Lester Beall: Space, Time & Content; RIT Graphic Design Chapbook Series 1, R. Roger Remington, 2003, RIT Cary Graphic Arts Press.

Description The Battle of Milvian Bridge, located in the Sala di Costantino (\\"Hall of Constantine\\"), is by Giulio Romano and other assistants of the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, who died in 1520. It was most likely painted to Raphael's design between 1520 and 1524. After the master's death, Giulio Romano worked together with other members of Raphael's workshop to finish the commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms that are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The Battle of the Milvian Bridge shows the battle that took place on 28 October 312 between the Roman Emperors Constantine I and Maxentius. Legend says that Constantine had a dream where a cross appeared in the heavens; a voice told him he would win the battle of Ponte Milvio if he used the cross as his standard. The cross became his standard and he won the battle, and attributed his victory to the god of Christianity. The Ponte Milvio still stands in Rome in pristine condition; until only a few years ago cars were permitted to use it to cross over the Tiber. It can now be used only by pedestrians.

Referred to in print as LRD Pyke, this led to his nickname of \\"Lardy\\". Early life Pyke was the son of Richard, an accountant, and Lillian Pyke, a teacher, journalist and author. He was one of three children and was educated at Wesley College, Melbourne. In 1927, on his mother's death, Pyke was orphaned and he was adopted by Lawrence Adamson, the bachelor Headmaster of Wesley. Pyke graduated as a Bachelor of Science form the University of Melbourne and as the 1934 Victorian Rhodes Scholar gained a Master of Arts from the University of Oxford. Early career After returning to Australia from Oxford University, Pyke taught at his alma mater, Wesley. He then worked as a lecturer and in research and administration at the University of Melbourne. In the late 1930s, Pyke married Mavis Clarke and they had three children: John Pyke, Robert and Jane. Headmaster From 1952 to 1960 he was headmaster of Newington College, Sydney. Pyke led the College through a period of unprecedented growth, both in the size of its enrolments and in the transformation of its physical fabric. He worked profitably with the College Council, particularly on a succession of building projects. Physically, the Stanmore campus had changed little since the imposing Wyvern House had been built in 1938. Continued growth in enrolments meant that new facilities were desperately needed. In 1952 work started on the War Memorial Block, the first of a series of permanent, modern buildings to be built along the southern boundary over the next few years. The building was opened in June 1953. Pyke was only the second scientist headmaster at Newington (most had been classical scholars) and he was keen to improve facilities for teaching Chemistry and Physics. A new science block was opened in 1955 followed by a manual arts block, including a new tuckshop, which was opened in 1957. He set in plan the ambitious project to complete the vision for the southern half of the original building by replacing old wooden structures with a modern building to balance the original stone north. Preliminary work started in 1959 on the building incorporating new classrooms, boarders' accommodation, an enlarged library and a new staff common room. Another important development under his leadership was the establishment of a preparatory school on the North Shore. A number of regions of Sydney were investigated in 1956 for opportunities to meet local demand for quality education and to increase the flow of primary students to the senior school at Stanmore. The Newington College Preparatory School at Killara opened at the beginning of 1957 and had 100 pupils by the end of the year. The expansion of the Newington's facilities reflected the growth in enrolments. There were some 600 boys in 1952 and this had risen to 970 by 1960. In the same eight years, teaching staff in the senior school grew from 23 to 42 staff members. Pyke was a progressive educator. While he gave particular attention to improving the teaching of science, the overall standard of education improved. This legacy, as much as the physical transformation of the school, marks his leadership at Newington. He resigned during 1960. University of Melbourne In 1961 he returned to the University of Melbourne as dean of graduate studies. Following retirement he died in July 1987.

Its natural geographic range extends from Newfoundland to South Carolina, and west to Minnesota, including the Great Lakes drainages.Page, Lawrence M. and Brooks M. Burr (1991), Freshwater Fishes, p. 216, Houghton Mifflin, New York. This species is the only freshwater killifish found in the northeastern United States. While it is primarily a freshwater species, it can occasionally be found in brackish water.Werner, Robert G. (2004), Freshwater Fishes of the Northeastern United States, p. 206, Syracuse University Press, Syracuse, New York. . Etymology The common name, \\"banded killifish\\", commonly refers to the distinct black and white vertical bandings found along their sides. The Latin genus name Fundulus is the diminutive of fundus, which means \\"bottom,\\" and the specific name diaphanus means \\"transparent\\" in Greek.Chippett, Jamie D. 2003. \\"Update COSEWIC status report on the banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, Newfoundland population in Canada\\", in COSEWIC assessment and update status report on the banded killifish Fundulus diaphanous in Canada. Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Ottawa. 1-21 pp Description Closeup of a banded killifish to show anatomical features. The banded killifish has an olive color on the dorsal surface and white coloring on the ventral. The throat and fins are yellowish. There are vertical blackish and silver-white stripes along the sides. There are 13‚Äì15 rays on a banded killifish's dorsal fin and 10‚Äì12 on the anal fin. The homocercal tail is slightly convex or rounded. It also has a small pelvic fin along the abdomen. The body is slender and elongated, with a flattish side and flattened head and small terminal mouth positioned for surface feeding. The banded killifish has a row of small sharp teeth lining their upper and lower jaws. It does not have a lateral line along the side but does have 39 to 43 cycloid scales in the lateral series. The average banded killifish ranges from 10 to 13 cm in length and weighs a few grams. The females tend to grow larger than the males. They also have darker bands on the sides. In contrast, the males have pale gray bands that are close together. The numbers of bands on the dorsal fin of a banded killifish is useful in determining the sex of this species. Range and distribution The banded killifish is widely distributed throughout eastern North America, ranging from South Carolina to as far north as the Atlantic Provinces. They are also found in the eastern part of Montana to Minnesota and throughout the suitable habitats of the Great Lakes watershed of southern Ontario to Lake Superior. Due to biogeographical isolation and limitation of potential for range expansion, banded killifish species were assigned a status of special concern by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). There are two subspecies, the eastern banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus diaphanus and the western banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus menona. The former is classified as an injurious aquatic invasive species in Ohio. Intergrades occur in the Saint Lawrence and Lake Erie drainages. The eastern subspecies is larger. Habitat and ecology Adults range from 2 to 3 years in age. Banded killifish are schooling fish, usually traveling in groups of 3‚Äì6 individuals, while the juveniles travel in groups of 8‚Äì12. The fish are most often found in the shallow and quiet areas of clear lakes, ponds, rivers, and estuaries with sandy gravel or muddy bottoms and with abundant aquatic vegetation. The sand and gravel provides hatchlings and juveniles with places to hide when threatened by predatory fish such as the largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, northern pike Esox lucius, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and trout. Because the banded killifish is small, it generally does not venture into deeper waters, where it would be vulnerable to predation as well as unable to swim in the fast currents. However, adult banded killifish have been observed to travel into deep bodies of water to feed. Banded killifish often congregate near aquatic vegetation, as it provides protection as well as breeding habitat. Banded killifish are euryhaline, but they usually inhabit freshwater streams and lakes. The largest adult recorded, observed in Indian Bay, Canada, was 12.8 cm. People have used banded killifish as fish bait. Most people do not favor them as pets because they require a high level of maintenance and therefore do not survive well in an aquarium setting. They are important to aquatic ecosystems because they are a food source for larger fish such as largemouth bass, northern pike, and trout. They are also a food source for birds such as belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon), common merganser (Mergus merganser), and herons. In January 2005 the banded killifish was listed as a vulnerable species under the Newfoundland Labrador Endangered Species Act and the Canada Species at Risk Act (SARA). This species is facing habitat degradation due to industrial development, motorized watercraft activities, and removal of aquatic vegetations. Diet Banded killifish have been observed to feed at all levels of the water column. The adults feed on a variety of items such as insects, nymphs, mollusks, turbellarians, and other small crustaceans. Mosquito larvae are also a popular food source. In contrast, the smaller individuals are limited to fewer items such as chironomid larvae, cladocerans, copepods, and midge larvae. Both young and adult banded killifish have been observed to feed mostly in the afternoon.Paulson, N. and Jay T. Hatch Reproduction and life cycle Banded killifish are commonly observed to spawn in dense aquatic vegetation because they practice external fertilization where the female lays her eggs that are equipped with adhesive threads that adhere to plants. Spawning occurs from June to mid-August in shallow waters. During the spawning season, the males go through a color change phase. They develop a bright blue patch near the anal fin. In addition, the lower portion of the body changes to a bright blue color. Spawning occurs at water temperatures of 21Àö C to 23Àö C. The male chooses a site in the shallow part of the water and protects it from other males. When a female appears, the male will court the female and fight with the other prospecting males. The female will emit one egg while the male pursues her. Once together, the female emits 10 eggs that falls onto the bottom or gets attached to aquatic plants in the chosen spawn area. The male will continue to pursue the female until the female have laid 50 to 100 eggs. A single female may lay several clutches of eggs during one summer. After the eggs have been fertilized, both the parents will leave and go their separate ways; the eggs do not receive parental care. 6-7 millimeter fries emerge within 10 to 12 days depending on the temperature of the water. They reach maturity at approximately 1 year with an average length of 6 cm. Banded killifish can live for a little over 2 years. However, there have been some that have been observed to live up to 3 years. Behavior =Shoaling behavior= Banded killifish form group shoals. The conditions in which shoaling occurs, the individuals who comprise the shoal, and the size of the shoal are all highly variable. Shoaling can be understood through a cost and benefit analysis. The costs and benefits of group membership are influenced by food availability and predatory risk. Bigger groups allow for better predatory protection, but are not as conducive to foraging because the food will be distributed amongst all of the group members. For smaller groups, there is not as effective predatory protection, but in regards to foraging each individual will have access to more food. The nutritional state of banded killifish influences individual's decisions to shoal or not. Food-deprived individuals spent more time by themselves and not in shoals. When food-deprived individuals were found in shoals their shoals were not any smaller than that of a well-fed banded killifish. Hungry banded killifish are more likely to leave a shoal than a well-fed individual. In the presence of a food stimulus, group size decreases, so that each individual does not have to compete with others for access to these resources. When presented with food odour, individuals were less attracted to neighbors, but when presented with a predatory stimulus, they were more attracted to neighbors and formed tighter shoals. When in the presence of both stimuli, the group size is intermediate. In the presence of a predatory stimulus, banded killifish decrease the amount of food attempts and duration of feeding posture. This is done to allocate more energy to predatory vigilance and avoidance. In both the presence and absence of predatory stimuli, banded killifish feeding rate for individuals is independent of shoal size. Lone individuals incur additional cost because they do not gain the improved predatory protection granted by shoal formation, and thus will attempt to join larger shoals rather than smaller shoals. When deciding whether to join a shoal or not, banded killifish value predatory protection over foraging opportunities. Predator protection In the presence of a predatory stimulus, shoal size increases to allow for greater protection via the dilution effect. From the dilution effect, each individual will have a lesser chance of being attacked by a predator, since there are many other individuals in the group. In a larger group, there is a larger chance that a predator will attack a different shoalmate than it will attack the individual of interest. Individuals who stray from the shoal have an increased mortality risk. This leads to selection for grouping. Besides the dilution effect, shoaling also benefits the individual because of group vigilance. To best protect against predation, the banded killifish must be on the lookout to detect predators. In a group, each individual can spend less time looking out for predators because others in the shoal can share in this responsibility. With increasing shoal size, each individual spends less time being vigilant, but with more individuals the group increases overall vigilance and therefore benefit each individual in the shoal. When one individual detects a predator, an alarm call is made to alert the shoal, so that the individuals can act to protect themselves from predatory attack. To improve predator avoidance, banded killifish will often take refuge. Frightened fish in the presence of a predatory stimulus will hide in a foodless refuge. This preference is modulated by individual body size. Larger individuals spend more time in the refuge than their smaller conspecifics. Smaller banded killifish individuals are more prone to risk than their larger counterparts. Shoaling preferences When choosing which shoals to join, banded killifish often choose to join ones that consist of others with similar phenotypes. In order to achieve this, banded killifish have shown the ability to discriminate between individuals within the species. Banded killifish distinguish individuals by body coloration phenotype. Banded killifish are likely to enter shoals with those of similar body color in order to maximize predator avoidance. An individual of different color might present as a contrast. This contrast is likely to make the shoal stand out and gain the predator's attention. Banded killifishes' level of preference for similarly colored shoalmates differs in the presence and absence of a predatory stimulus. Banded killifish use body coloration to determine if an individual has been parasitized or not. Black spots indicate the presence of a parasite, whereas the absence of these spots indicates an unparasitized individual. Both parasitized and unparasitized individuals preferred to join unparasitized shoals. The preference for unparasitized shoals increases with an increase in parasite load of a parasitized individual. Shoaling preferences in banded killifish differ in shoal species composition, shoal size, and individual body size within the shoal. The shift in preferences is triggered by predatory stimuli. In the presence of predatory stimuli, a banded killifish individual will prefer the bigger conspecific shoal, but only as long as the shoal is homogenous in individual fish size. If the size of individual fish were different, they would join a shoal of similarly sized fish regardless of shoal size. This preference is maintained by predatory threat. Body size is a more significant determinant of shoaling preference than shoal size and species composition. Banded killifish have been found to engage in heterospecific shoaling with other species of killifish as well as other fish. There are many situational factors that determine if the banded killifish individual would want to engage in heterospecific shoaling. If body size is similar, then banded killifish prefer conspecific shoals as opposed to heterospecific ones. Size is a sorting mechanism for conspecific as opposed to heterospecific shoaling.

Produced by Famous Studios, the cartoon was originally released to theaters by Paramount Pictures on February 19, 1943. Plot Two mummies attack Superman.At the Metropolis museum, a local Egyptologist, Dr. Jordan, is found murdered. His assistant, Ms. Jane Hogan finds his dead body in front of the sarcophagus of King Tush. She finds a syringe near the doctor's body. With no other evidence to go on, the police assume that Ms. Hogan is the killer. She admits that her fingerprints are on the syringe, and she is convicted for the murder. A few days later, Clark Kent gets a call from a professor at the museum, asking him to come to the museum and listen to another theory on the death of Dr. Jordan. Clark sneaks out, claiming it is his Doctor, but out of curiosity, Lois follows. At the museum, the professor explains to Clark how he believes that Dr. Jordan was actually killed by a mummy's curse. He takes Clark through the Egypt exhibit at the museum and tells him the story of King Tush. (King Tush's story is similar to the story of King Tut.) Lois follows them, making sure not to be seen. Before his death, the 12-year-old Tush's father, the old pharaoh who ruled the North and warred against the South, commanded his giant, superhuman guards to swear an oath to protect his son throughout eternity. After his death, Tush became the pharaoh. Shortly after that, King Tush became ill, already being young and sickly, and eventually died. Keeping their promise to the old pharaoh, the guards committed suicide by drinking poison in order to protect King Tush in the afterlife. The professor then shows Clark the catacombs which Dr. Jordan recreated in the image of how it looked inside the pyramids. He then reveals that Dr. Jordan had recreated an ancient formula called the Fluid of Life, which he injected into the giant guard's mummified bodies, hoping they would return to life, but seemingly failed. As they approach King Tush's sarcophagus, the professor explains that Dr. Jordan invoked the curse by trying to open the king's sarcophagus. Clark pushes a button on the side of the sarcophagus and just misses being pricked by a poisoned syringe that shoots out at him. This new evidence seems enough to clear Ms. Hogan of the murder charges. Sensing that the needle missed, the sarcophagus opens and a light from the dead king's jeweled amulet awakens his giant guards. The guards attack Clark, Lois and the professor. Clark is thrown into a sarcophagus, where he quickly changes into Superman. As Superman, he defeats the giant guards and saves Lois and the professor from a grim demise by fire. Back at the Daily Planet, Clark smiles as he finishes his report on Ms. Hogan being released from jail. Lois is sitting on the desk. She was injured in the mummy attack and her hands had to be bandaged up (therefore, she wasn't able to write the story herself). She grumbles as Clark finishes his story. When Clark asks how she knew to be there, she replies, \\"My mummy done told me.\\" Voice cast * Joan Alexander as Lois Lane, Jane Hogan (uncredited) * Jackson Beck as Dr. Wilson, Narrator (uncredited) * Bud Collyer as Clark Kent / Superman (most lines - uncredited) :* Sam Parker as Clark Kent (last lines - uncredited) References External links * * The Mummy Strikes at the Internet Archive * Category:1943 films Category:1943 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1940s animated short films Category:1940s animated superhero films Category:American films Category:Superman animated shorts Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Isadore Sparber Category:Paramount Pictures short films Category:Mummy films ","title":"The Mummy Strikes"},{"id":"11827401","text":"The Canon EOS 40D is a 10.1-megapixel semi-professional digital single-lens reflex camera. It was initially announced on 20 August 2007 and was released at the end of that month. It is the successor of the Canon EOS 30D, and is succeeded by the EOS 50D. It can accept EF and EF-S lenses. Like its predecessor, it uses an APS-C sized image sensor, resulting in a 1.6x field of view crop factor. Improvements Changes over the 30D include a higher- resolution sensor (10.1 megapixel instead of 8.2). The sensor also has better noise control than previous models. The 40D has a larger memory buffer so more pictures can be taken in succession without a slow down in frame rate. Frames per second has been increased from 5 to 6.5. The 40D adds a new format, Canon's sRAW, which is a smaller RAW image for smaller prints and reduced file sizes. The 40D's RAW format is 14-bit instead of the 12-bit of the 30D. The camera uses the new DIGIC III image processor, which was first used in the Canon EOS-1D Mark III, introduced earlier that year.

There is also a new menu for external and internal flash control, including second curtain sync. Other additions on the Canon 40D include interchangeable focusing screens, an AF-ON button, the EOS Integrated Cleaning System for sensor dust reduction, rubber strips around the battery and CF doors for improved weather sealing and three new optional accessories: an IS version of the 18-55mm kit lens; a new backward-compatible, live view mode, and a weather-sealed battery grip. Overview and features Back of the Canon EOS 40D camera The 40D has many similar characteristics to its predecessors the 20D and 30D, but also many differences. This includes various shooting modes, ability to change ISO and white balance, a pop-up flash unit, an LCD screen of 3.0 inches (an upgrade from the previous model, the Canon EOS 30D with a screen of only 2.5 inches), and a rugged magnesium alloy protective inner-shell, which both the Canon 30D and 40D have. The newest feature to the 40D is Live View (previously used on the EOS 20Da), allowing photographers to use the LCD screen as their viewfinder. It is very useful for taking pictures low to the ground, when the eye cannot reach the viewfinder. The shutter noise is quieter in this mode as well. * 10.1 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor * DIGIC III processor * 3.0 inch LCD Monitor * 14-bit Processor * Live View Mode * Wide 9 point AF (all points are cross-type with the centre point having an additional f/2.8 sensitive cross- type sensor placed diagonally) * Selectable AF and metering modes * Built in Flash * EOS Integrated Cleaning System * ISO 100‚Äì1600 (3200 with custom function) * Continuous Drive up to 6.5 frame/s (75 images (JPEG), 17 images (RAW)) * Canon EF/EF-S Lenses * Canon EX Speedlites * PAL/NTSC video output * File Formats include: JPEG, RAW, sRAW (both RAW formats are 14-bit) * RAW & JPEG simultaneous recording * USB 2.0 computer interface * BP-511/BP-511A or BP-512/BP-514 Battery Types (BP-511A battery supplied) * Tough inner metal (magnesium alloy) shell * Approx Weight 0.822 kg Firmware and software , the latest firmware is 1.1.1, released 20 January 2009.

(; May 9, 1555 ‚Äì October 22, 1630) was a Catholic nun who founded the Real Monasterio de Santa Clara (Royal Monastery of Saint Clare) in Intramuros, Philippines. For her efforts in establishing the first Catholic monastery in Manila and the Far East, the Vatican issued an apostolic decree for her beatification in 1734. This monastery was immortalized in the novel Noli Me T√°ngere, penned by the national hero, Jos√© Rizal.Ruano, Pedro, O.F.M. (Vice-General Postulator). Mother Jeronima de la Asunci√≥n (1555-1630), A Biography, Monastery of St. Claire, Quezon City, Philippines, 1999.Serrano, Hanna, Tanya J. Tiffany and Ronald E. McNair. Mother Jeronima de la Fuente: Founder of First Convent of Nuns in the Philippines, A Woman Religious and Reflection of Christ, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee , retrieved on: June 17, 2007 Biography Jer√≥nima was born in Toledo, Spain to Pedro Garc√≠a e Y√°nez and Catalina de la Fuente, pious natives of Toledo who were both of noble lineage. Jer√≥nima spent her childhood in Toledo, where she learned the basics of Christian life very early on. At the age of fourteen, she met the great Carmelite reformer, Teresa of √Åvila, O.C.D., after which she felt the calling to monastic life. She was also influenced by a biography of Saint Clare of Assisi. On August 15, 1570, Jer√≥nima entered the Colettine monastery of Santa Isabel la Real de Toledo. At this monastery, she joined two of her aunts who were already professed nuns in the community. She later occasionally functioned as Mistress of Novices. =Voyage to the Far East= Sister Jer√≥nima learned about the intention of her Order to establish a monastery in Manila in the Spanish East Indies, and volunteered to be among this pioneering community. On October 21, 1619, she received notice that her offer had been accepted. Friar Jos√© de Santa Mar√≠a, O.F.M., was named Procurator to arrange the necessary royal travel permits and other financial matters for the venture, while Jer√≥nima herself was appointed as foundress and first abbess of the Philippine monastery. The new monastery would be the first of its kind, both to be established in Manila and the entire Far East. A pamphlet cover with a reproduction of Vel√°zquez's 1620 painting of Mother Jer√≥nima. Mother Jer√≥nima's journey began in April 1620, with an initial group of six nuns; she was already 66 years old at that time. From Toledo, they travelled by river to Seville where they were joined by two more nuns, and then went on to C√°diz, from where they set sail across the Atlantic Ocean. By late September 1620, the nuns reached Mexico City in New Spain and stayed there for about six months at another monastery of the Order, and where two more nuns from that community joined the group. On Ash Wednesday of 1621, Mother Jeronima and her group left Mexico by road to cross the mountains towards Acapulco. Once there, on April 21, 1621, the group boarded the galleon San Andr√©s to sail for the Philippines. The women kept a record of their journey from Toledo to Manila. One nun died during the crossing, while the ship was near the Mariana Islands. The rest of the group eventually landed in the port of Bolinao on July 24, 1621. They travelled south, reaching Intramuros, the colony's capital, on August 5, 1621. They arrived one year, three months and nine days after leaving Toledo. =The Repudiation of Filipinas= A more sensitive issue was the admission of native (\\"India\\") aspirants. The royal foundation was specifically created for \\"pious Spanish women and daughters of the conquistadors who cannot marry properly\\" without mention of native women. Silence on the latter was then conveniently interpreted as prohibition, and it was questioned whether Indias, like \\"Jews, Moors, Negroes, and gypsies\\" possessed the \\"purity of blood\\" (limpieza de sangre) needed for membership in sublime Spanish institutions like monasteries. Despite the legalistic controversy, Indias began knocking at the convent gates, begging to be admitted. Around 1628, the application of Do√±a Mar√≠a Uray of Dapitan (\\"Uray\\" denoting her status as a native noblewoman), was rejected simply because she was classified as an \\"India.\\" Despite being a granddaughter of Datu Pagbuaya of Dapitan unto whom El Adelantado Don Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi was beholden, her second application was turned down anew. =Later life and death= During the last thirty years of her life, Mother Jer√≥nima lived in constant illness. In early September 1630, her health deteriorated. She died at dawn on October 22, 1630, at the age of 75. Mother Jer√≥nima's remains were first buried in a niche within a wall inside the monastery, but her remains were later relocated five times. The first was in 1670 to deter local devotees, while the second happened in 1712 due to the reconstruction of the monastery, when the remains were placed in the lower choir. The third relocation was during the British Occupation of Manila in 1763, when her coffin was transferred to the old Church of Saint Francis in Intramuros. The remains were returned to the monastery in 1765, and later survived the aerial bombings during the Battle of Manila in 1945. In the 1950s, her bones were finally placed at the monastery's new site in Dilim√°n, Quezon City. Portrait Modern-day photographs and images of Jer√≥nima de la Asunci√≥n are replicas of the depiction by the renowned court painter Diego Vel√°zquez. The portrait was composed during Mother Jer√≥nima's stopover in Seville en route to the Philippines. The painting is described as conveying the then-sixty-six-year-old nun's \\"devoutness and strength of character through her stern expression and rugged countenance; her direct, outward gaze at the beholder; and her expressive accoutrements\\". Mother Jer√≥nima is depicted wearing her dark religious habit while holding a book and a crucifix. The inscriptions on the painting read \\"It is good to await the salvation of God in silence\\" (top), while the banderole that flows from her mouth reads \\"I shall be satisfied as long as He is glorified\\".Zirpolo, Lillian.

Louis. The film is set on the fictional Beaver Creek Indian Reservation in South Dakota near the Nebraska border, a place very much like the actual Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the setting in the book and the place where the film was actually shot. Lakota Sioux tribal police officer Rudy Yellow Lodge (Eric Schweig) struggles to rescue his older, alcoholic brother, Mogie (Graham Greene), a former football star who was wounded in combat three times in Vietnam. Winona LaDuke makes a cameo appearance as Rose Two Buffalo. Plot Rudy and Mogie Yellow Lodge are Lakota Sioux brothers on the Beaver Creek Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Mogie, unemployed and with a teenage son. Rudy, a police officer, struggles to care for his brother, nephew and the rest of the town through the hands of law. Mogie resists Rudy's attempts, preferring to drink and joke about the depressed state of their people and town. As a child, Rudy had been bitten by a spider, and Mogie told him it was Iktomi, the trickster spider; this spider re-appears to Rudy early in the film and Rudy's attempts to help begin to wander outside the lines of the law. When Rudy is sent on a police call to an abandoned house, he finds the bloodied, dead body of a young man who has been kicked to death. Rudy sees someone in the darkness, but the stranger escapes and Rudy trips and falls onto a rock before he can identify his quarry. Rudy's friend tells him that rocks are very spiritual and Rudy begins to worry that something has gotten into him, turning him vigilante. He sees a teenage boy wearing the same shoes as the figure who ran away from the scene of the murder, and follows him. Rudy overhears the boy talk with a friend about disposing a pair of boots that connects them to the murder. Disguising himself with black paint on his face, Rudy sneaks up on the boys with a baseball bat and viciously beats their kneecaps, announcing himself as the ghost of the boy they murdered. While washing the paint off his face, he again sees Iktomi. Angered by a news report about a liquor store in the bordering town profiting off of alcoholic Native Americans, Rudy sets out - again with a painted face - and sets the store on fire. Unknown to Rudy, Mogie was on the roof of the building trying to steal some alcohol. Mogie escapes and survives, but is burned and severely scarred. Shocked, Rudy visits a friend to get instructions on how to deal with Iktomi's spirit; a combination of home remedies and a sweat lodge ceremony. During Mogie‚Äôs stay in the hospital, the doctors discover that he is dying, because of his failing liver. After he is released from the hospital, Mogie, his son Herbie, Rudy, and Aunt Helen have dinner, and Mogie brings up American Horse, an Oglala Indian who testified against the 7th Cavalry. This conversation brings up the story of the Wounded Knee Massacre, which Rudy tells to Herbie. Rudy tells Mogie that he started the fire, and Mogie replies that the one thing he can do to make up for it is blow the nose off of George Washington's face on Mount Rushmore. Rudy calls the idea crazy, and refuses. Responding to a police call of a man stuck in a trap, Rudy arrives outside a house to find that the victim, now dead, is Mogie's drinking partner. The owners of the house seems to have no remorse for the man's death. When Mogie finds out the story behind his friend's death, he goes to the family's house with a gun, but is dissuaded from using it when a child appears in the room. Mogies dies of pneumonia shortly after his son's 18th birthday. A letter Mogie wrote before his death asks Rudy to care for his son. Rudy finds out that the liquor store is being rebuilt, and will now be twice as big and have two drive-in windows. He buys a large can of oil-based red paint and drives to Mount Rushmore. He climbs to the top, and standing on the head of George Washington, he ponders whether his plan is stupid, he once again sees Iktomi crawling across the paint can. Seeing this, he makes his tribute to Mogie by throwing the can of paint so that it drips down the side of George Washington's nose, almost like a rivulet of bloody tears. On the drive back, he sees a hitchhiker that looks like Mogie in his youth and laughs. Cultural background The Lakota originated from the Great Lakes region where they were called Dakota. After they were pushed west by the Ojibwe People (Chippewa), they became a fixture of the Plains. Following the enormous herds of buffalo for the subsistence, the Lakota were nomadic in nature. Today there are about 70,000 Lakota, 20,500 of whom speak the Lakota language. Mogie and Rudy are Oglala Lakota as most residents of the Pine Ridge Reservation identify. Pine Ridge, the reservation where Skins takes place is the largest reservation in South Dakota but the poorest reservation in all of the United States, with unemployment at around 80% and 49% of its approximate 28,000 live below the poverty line. These statistics have increased from 2002 when the movie was filmed. The harsh living condition and high rates of alcoholism and violence of this particular reservation is very apparent in the film. Mogie‚Äôs door is falling off of the hinges and every one of Rudy‚Äôs police calls involves either intoxication or violence or both. Unfortunately, the fictional film is a very realistic depiction of life on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Pine Ridge was originally part of the Great Sioux Reservation established by the Fort Laramie Treaty in 1868, but after several wars, including the Black Hills War, the reservation was divided into seven reservations, one being Pine Ridge. The Black Hills were very sacred to the Lakota and the conflict between them and the United States originally started because the Lakota did not want mining to happen in the Black Hills, but the U.S. persisted when gold was found there. The Black Hills are mentioned in Skins when Rudy's friend is telling him how sacred rocks are (\\"like the Black Hills\\"). On December 29, 1890, while the U.S. 7th Cavalry was moving the Oglala to Pine Ridge, 300 Oglala were murdered and 25 members of the U.S. 7th Cavalry were killed during what has now been named the Wounded Knee Massacre. Mogie and Rudy tell the story of Wounded Knee over dinner with Herbie and Aunt Helen. ‚ÄúAt that time, all Indian religious ceremonies were banned because [white soldiers] were afraid of them‚Äù Rudy tells Herbie. It is obvious through Mogie‚Äôs anger during the story that the injustice of the Wounded Knee Massacre still haunts him. Through the rest of the film, Mogie‚Äôs satirical humor makes it clear that the white man‚Äôs power still looms over Pine Ridge through the faces of Mount Rushmore that ironically watch over the reservation, and that he hasn‚Äôt forgotten the past. In more recent history, 1973 was the year that the American Indian Movement (AIM) led the Wounded Knee Incident, resulting in a 71-day stand-off. On February 27, 1973 AIM members and a handful of Pine Ridge residents seized the town of Wounded Knee to bring to light numerous murders, crimes and charges of corruption committed by the Pine Ridge Tribal Council and the Chairman, Richard A. \\"Dick\\" Wilson. As a result, FBI agents, the U.S. Marshall's Service, and the National Guard on the other side blockaded all entrances and exits leading to and from Wounded Knee. After Wounded Knee 1973, the persecution, illegal arrests, prosecutorial misconduct and numerous as-yet-unsolved murders continued against various members of AIM and several residents of Pine Ridge. No action was taken by the federal government, not even a cursory investigation, against Dick Wilson. Wounded Knee 1973 was the culmination of the violence that swarmed the rest of the decade at Pine Ridge, naming it the ‚Äúmurder capitol of the United States‚Äù with up to 170 murders to every 100,000 people in 1976. While no reservation in Canada or the United States is without cases of extreme violence, poverty, substance abuse, and hopelessness, Pine Ridge stands alone in the misery index. Themes =Alcoholism= Alcoholism is depicted in the film in numerous ways, and as such is an exploration on the topic of alcoholism present within Native American culture. On the Pine Ridge Reservation alcoholism is nine times the national average, and life expectancy is nearly half of that in the rest of the country. The liquor-selling border town portrayed in the movie is representative of the town of Whiteclay, Nebraska, also known as \\"little skid row on the prairie\\".Magnuson, Death of Raymond Yellow Thunder Mogie suffers from alcoholism, as many on the reservation do, and is diagnosed with a terminal liver condition as an effect of his drinking. Skins explores the tragedy and depth of despair caused by alcohol amongst indigenous peoples of North America, and brings the issue to the forefront in its almost brutal depictions of the disease. The lineage of alcoholism is also explored when it is revealed in flashbacks that both Rudy and Mogie were abused by their father, an alcoholic in his own right. =Western Expansion and Massacre= The theme of western expansion and the devastating effect this had on Native Americans is most prevalent within the setting of the film. The Pine Ridge Reservation is in the shadow of Mount Rushmore, a gigantic monolith of American expansion and the desecration of sacred tribal grounds. America's founding fathers were carved into a mountain sacred to the Sioux, highlighting the lack of respect by Euro-American cultures for Native Americans. This theme becomes especially prevalent in the final scene, which takes place with Mount Rushmore hovering ominously in the background. Another aspect of western expansion explored in the film is the fact that the location of the Wounded Knee Massacre is located on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The mention of the massacre and the honoring of the members of the 7th Cavalry with Congressional Medals of Honor is a not so subtle dig at the suffering Native Americans experienced at the hands of Euro-Americans during their western expansion. =Justice for Native Americans= One of the most intriguing themes explored is that of the white justice for indigenous Americans. The policies of the American government towards indigenous peoples are explored via Rudy becoming a vigilante and pursuing his own idea of justice. The anger that Rudy feels towards businesses selling liquor when welfare checks are released, by taking advantage of the alcoholism present on the reservation leads him to burning down one of these businesses.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, citing, \\"To see this movie is to understand why the faces on Mount Rushmore are so painful and galling to the first Americans. The movie's final scene is haunting.\\" Mark Holcomb of The Village Voice was more critical: \\"Like his popular 1998 debut, Smoke Signals, Chris Eyre's follow-up, Skins, is a humorless slice of family melodrama that functions as cut-rate ethnography.\\"http://www.villagevoice.com/film/under-the-scars-6412436 Metacritic has an aggregate score for the film of 57 out of 100 based on 19 reviews.

The record is a twelve-part suite based on the work of William Shakespeare. Background In August 1956, Duke Ellington and his orchestra were in Canada, performing in the same city as the ongoing Stratford Shakespearean Festival. Curious, Ellington and his longtime composer/arranger Billy Strayhorn talked to festival staffers, and Ellington soon announced his next album project would be a conceptual piece, paying tribute to Shakespeare's varied works with appropriate jazz compositions. In addition to the Such Sweet Thunder album, he promised the entire suite would be performed at the 1957 edition of the festival. Ellington and Strayhorn began building a home library of Shakespeare, seeking out Shakespeare experts, and reading through the canon during orchestra downtime. The suite that would constitute Such Sweet Thunder was written in just under three weeks and recorded in early 1957. Although most of the compositions were created for the suite in conjunction with Strayhorn, a few were versions of older Strayhorn songs that were reworked and re-titled for the collection.

The band consisted of vocalist Al Johnson, guitarist Mark Shippy, drummer Todd Lamparelli, and bassist Luke Frantom. After the group's breakup, Al Johnson and Mark Shippy would go on to form the underground art rock band U.S. Maple. History Officially forming in 1991, Shorty's roots can be traced back to 1986, when vocalist Al Johnson and guitarist Mark Shippy first met through mutual friends. At the time, both were involved in local Illinois rock bands; Johnson in the DeKalb, Illinois, gothic rock band Nursery, and Mark Shippy in the Crystal Lake, Illinois, art rock group, the Muckrakers, consisting of Shippy (known as Harry), Larry Nutley (known as Icky Muck), Tom Nutley (known as Stu), and Eddie Buster (known as Ponaman). In the spring of 1988, Johnson and Shippy decided to join together for an as-yet unnamed project, placing an ad in a local DeKalb newspaper for bandmates to back them up. After a number of responses which went nowhere, the two were approached by Todd Lamparelli and Anthony Ciarrocchi, childhood friends and recent castoffs from the Chicago Heights punk rock band Tricot Mesh. Together, the four-piece began playing under an ever-changing assortment of names such as Dragster, and Bomb.[] By the fall of 1988 Ciarrocki had quit the band, replaced by new bassist Tim Mescher. By 1989 the band had changed its name again, this time to Snailboy, a term referring to a lethargic racehorse. The band released two singles as Snailboy, the first, Mungo, was released by Tar guitarist John Mohr on his own No Blow record label. During this period, the band was living and recording in a farmhouse owned by one of Lamparelli's co-workers for 50 dollars a month. Life in the farmhouse was rustic to say the least; while residing there the band had to deal with geese and weasels running loose inside the house, Lamparelli's co-worker's naked daughter defecating on the floors, and nests of baby mice infesting their amplifiers.[] In August 1990 the band departed for Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, to record their second single, Spoo Heaven, with producer Butch Vig. In April 1991, Spoo Heaven was released by Sympathy for the Record Industry. This period also saw the replacement of bassist Tim Mescher, (who was not getting along with the other band members), with bassist Luke Frantom, who had previously worked with Johnson during his time in Nursery.[] The addition of Frantom to the group's lineup resulted in a third and final name change. The band members ultimately adopted and finalized the group's name as Shorty, a moniker which would last until the group's demise. The new name was agreed upon by both Johnson and Shippy, but for different reasons; Shippy approved the name because for him it elicited connotations of the unconventional guitar playing of Guitar Shorty, while Johnson chose to adopt the name because he saw it as a common street name, befitting the group's raw sound. The name change was unofficially adopted by the band in May 1991, and officially became the band's new name in September of that year. Under the name Shorty, the band released a 7‚Äù on the Worry Bird label called, ‚ÄúLast One in my Mouth is a Jerk,‚Äù and contributed a track to the ‚ÄúOn a Clear Day You Can See Byron‚Äù compilation. In December 1992 the band released the Steve Albini produced Niggerhat 7‚Äù on Bovine Records.[] While Shorty was busy writing songs for their first LP, friend of the band John Mohr was touring Europe with Tar, where he was approached by Rene Herbst, a musician who had heard Shorty's No Blow single and was interested in financing the band's first full-length release. The band accepted Herbst's offer, and with Albini's acting as producer, began laying down tracks at the Chicago Recording Company, eventually following Albini into his home studio to mix the album. The band's first LP, Thumb Days, was released in April 1993 on German label Gasoline Boost Records. Thirty five hundred copies were pressed, all of which sold out prior to the LP's official release. Shorty's sudden international attention caught the eye of Skin Graft Records‚Äô owner Mark Fischer, who released Shorty's Kaput! 7‚Äù and arranged American tour dates with Skin Graft artists such as Zeni Geva and the Dazzling Killmen.[] Once the band had finished touring America, they began work on songs for their second LP, Fresh Breath, and in April 1994 embarked on their first European tour. Upon their return to America, Frantom, faced with personal business matters that required his full attention, was forced to quit the band. Frantom's departure marked the beginning of the end for the group as a whole; Fresh Breath, the follow-up to Thumb Days, was released in June 1994 as the band was in the first throes of a breakup. Following a further American tour fraught with personnel and technical problems, the band finally folded, playing their last show at the Lounge Ax in July 1994. Johnson and Shippy remained together following Shorty's breakup, and along with guitarist Todd Rittmann and drummer Pat Samson (who replaced Jim Kimball), went on to form the No Wave-influenced U.S. Maple.[] Due to Al Johnson moving away from the Chicago area, US Maple seems to be in a temporary hiatus. Mark Shippy has formed two new projects, Miracle Condition and Invisible Things.

The IHR is the only international legal treaty with the responsibility of empowering the World Health Organization (WHO) to act as the main global surveillance system. In 2005, following the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak, several changes were made to the previous revised IHRs originating from 1969. The 2005 IHR came into force in June 2007, with 196 binding countries that recognised that certain public health incidents, extending beyond disease, ought to be designated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), as they pose a significant global threat. Its first full application was in response to the swine flu pandemic of 2009. History The original International Health Regulations (IHR) were founded in 1969, but its underpinnings can be traced to the mid-19th century, when measures to tackle the spread of plague, yellow fever, smallpox and particularly cholera across borders, with as little interference to global trade and commerce, were debated.Howard-Jone, Norman (1975) \\"The scientific background of the International Sanitary Conferences\\". World Health Organization; Geneva, p. 13. To address the realisation that countries varied with regards to their sanitary regulations and quarantine measures, the first of these series of early international sanitary conferences, convened in Paris in 1851, in the same year that telegraphic communications became established between London and Paris and when 12 nations attended, of which 11 were European States and three signed the resulting convention. The 19th century witnessed 10 of these conferences. In 1948, the World Health Organization Constitution came about. In 1951, the WHO issued their first infectious disease prevention regulations, the 'International Sanitary Regulations', which focussed on six quarantinable diseases; cholera, plague, relapsing fever, smallpox, typhoid and yellow fever. These were revised and renamed the 'International Health Regulations' in 1969. The Twenty-Sixth World Health Assembly in 1973 amended the IHR (1969) in relation to provisions on cholera. In view of the global eradication of smallpox, the Thirty-fourth World Health Assembly amended the IHR (1969) to exclude smallpox in the list of notifiable diseases. =World Health Assembly 1995= During the Forty-Eighth World Health Assembly in 1995, WHO and Member States agreed on the need to revise the IHR (1969). The revision of IHR (1969) came about because of its inherent limitations, most notably: * narrow scope of notifiable diseases (cholera, plague, yellow fever). The past few decades have seen the emergence and re- emergence of infectious diseases. The emergence of ‚Äúnew‚Äù infectious agents Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Zaire (modern- day Democratic Republic of Congo) and the re-emergence of cholera and plague in South America and India, respectively; * dependence on official country notification; and * lack of a formal internationally coordinated mechanism to prevent the international spread of disease. These challenges were placed against the backdrop of the increased travel and trade characteristic of the 20th century. =International Health Regulations (2005)= The IHR (2005) entered into force, generally, on 15 June 2007, and are currently binding on 196 States Parties, including all 194 Member States (countries) of WHO. The Principles Embodying the IHR (2005) The implementation of IHR (2005) shall be: # With full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedom of persons; # Guided by the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitution of the World Health Organization; # Guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease; # States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to legislate and to implement legislation in pursuance of their health policies. In doing so, they should uphold the purpose of these Regulations.Art. 3, IHR (2005) =2010 Geneva meeting= In 2010, at the Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction in Geneva, the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was suggested as well-tested means for enhancing the monitoring of infections and parasitic agents, for practical implementation of the IHR (2005) with the aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties. The significance of the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is pointed out in assessing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents in the environmental sites, conducting laboratory analysis of biological materials, suppressing hotbeds of infectious diseases, providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.  Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)  A Public Health Emergency of International Concern, or PHEIC, is defined in the IHR (2005) as, ‚Äúan extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response‚Äù. This definition implies a situation that is: * serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; * carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border; and * may require immediate international action. Since 2007, the WHO Director-General has declared public health emergencies of international concern in response to the following: * 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic * 2014 setbacks in global polio eradication efforts * 2013‚Äì2016 Western African Ebola virus epidemic * 2016 Zika virus outbreak * 2018‚Äì19 Kivu Ebola epidemic * 2019‚Äì20 COVID-19 pandemic IHR Experts Roster The IHR Experts Roster, which is regulated by Article 47 of the IHR, is tended by DGWHO, who \\"shall establish a roster composed of experts in all relevant fields of expertise... In addition, [s/he] shall appoint one member at the request of each State Party.\\" Pro-tem structure =IHR Emergency Committee= In order to declare a PHEIC, the WHO Director- General is required to take into account factors which include the risk to human health and international spread as well as advice from an internationally made up committee of experts, the IHR Emergency Committee (EC), one of which should be an expert nominated by the State within whose region the event arises. Rather than being a standing committee, the EC is created ad hoc. Until 2011, the names of IHR EC members were not publicly disclosed; in the wake of reforms now they are. These members are selected according to the disease in question and the nature of the event. Names are taken from the IHR Experts Roster. The Director-General takes the EC's advice following their technical assessment of the crisis using legal criteria and a predetermined algorithm after a review of all available data on the event. Upon declaration of the PHEIC, the EC then makes recommendations on what actions the Director-General and Member States should take to address the crisis. The recommendations are temporary and require three-monthly reviews. =IHR Review Committee= The formation of an IHR Review Committee is the responsibility of the DGWHO, who assures their care and feeding. They are selected from the IHR Experts Committee, and \\"when appropriate, other expert advisory panels of the Organization.\\" Furthermore, the DGWHO \\"shall establish the number of members to be invited to a meeting, determine its date and duration, and convene the Committee.\\" \\"The DGWHO shall select the members of the Review Committee on the basis of the principles of equitable geographical representation, gender balance, a balance of experts from developed and developing countries, representation of a diversity of scientific opinion, approaches and practical experience in various parts of the world, and an appropriate interdisciplinary balance.\\"  Criticism of international health regulations  Revisions to the International Health Regulations in 2005 were meant to lead to improved global health security and cooperation. However, the WHO's perceived delayed and inadequate response to the West African Ebola epidemic brought renewed international scrutiny to the International Health Regulations. By 2015, 127 of the 196 countries were unable to meet the eight core public health capacities and report public health events as outlined.Solomon, Danielle. (9 January 2019). \\"Brexit and health security: why we need to protect our global networks\\". Journal of Public Health Policy. National Library of Medicine (US) website 40(1): 1‚Äì4. doi: 10.1057/s41271-018-00160-3. Retrieved 6 April 2020. Numerous published reports by high-level panels have assessed the International Health Regulations for inadequacies and proposed actions that can be taken to improve future responses to outbreaks.L. Gostin et al. \\"The International Health Regulations 10 years on: the governing framework for global health security,\\" Lancet, vol. 386, pp. 2222‚Äì2226, 2015. One publication reviewed seven of these major reports and identified areas of consensus on action.S. Moon et al. \\"Post-Ebola reforms: ample analysis, inadequate action,\\" BMJ, vol. 356, 2017. The seven reports noted inadequate compliance with WHO's International Health Regulations as a major contributor to the slow response to Ebola. They found three major obstacles that contributed to poor compliance: * countries‚Äô core capacities, * unjustified trade and travel restrictions, and * inability to ensure that governments report outbreaks quickly. = Core capacity = The IHR requires countries to assess their disease surveillance and response capacities and to identify if they can adequately meet their requirements. The seven Ebola reports universally agree that the country's self-assessment capabilities are insufficient and that verification measures need to be improved upon. A significant problem is the inadequate level of core capacities in some countries, and the question of how to build upon them has been frequently raised. The reports make several recommendations to encourage governments to increase investment in outbreak identification and response programs. These include technical help from external sources conditional on mobilizing domestic resources, external financing for low income countries, pressure from the international community to increase investment, and considering outbreak preparedness as a factor in the International Monetary Fund's country economic assessments, which influence governments‚Äô budget priorities and access to capital markets. = Trade and travel = The second issue frequently raised is ensuring that restrictions on trade and travel during outbreaks are justified. Because of increased attention and concern from the public and the media, many governments and private companies restricted trade and travel during the Ebola outbreak, though many of these measures were not necessary from a public health standpoint. These restrictions worsened financial repercussions and made the work of aid organizations sending support to affected regions more difficult. There was broad consensus across the reports that bringing such restrictions to a minimum is critical to avoid further harm to countries experiencing outbreaks. Moreover, if governments assume that reporting will lead to inappropriate travel and trade restrictions, they may be hesitant to notify the international community about the outbreak. Potential solutions raised included the WHO and the UN more assertively ‚Äúnaming and shaming‚Äù countries and private companies that impose unjustified restrictions on WHO working with the World Trade Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, and International Maritime Organization to develop standards and enforcement mechanisms for trade and travel restrictions. = Outbreak reporting = The third compliance issue relates to countries‚Äô obligation to rapidly report outbreaks. The reports recommend strengthening this obligation by WHO publicizing when countries delay reporting suspected outbreaks. In contrast, mechanisms ensuring that countries rapidly receive operational and financial support as soon as they do report were also recommended. A novel approach to encourage early notification is the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility. This was created to provide rapid financing for the control of outbreaks and to protect countries from the devastating economic effects of outbreaks via an insurance program. Joint External Evaluations (JEE) A Joint External Evaluation (JEE) is \\"a voluntary, collaborative, multisectoral process to assess country capacities to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to public health risks whether occurring naturally or due to deliberate or accidental events\\". The JEE helps countries to identify critical gaps within their biosecurity systems in order to improve them and help prevent, detect and quickly respond to public health risks (whether natural, accidental or deliberate) in the future. Developed as a result of the IHR Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation, WHO, in collaboration with partners and initiatives, developed the JEE process and published the first edition of the tool in 2016. A second edition was published in 2018. A JEE of Australia's capacity following the 2013‚Äì2016 Western African Ebola virus epidemic showed that the nation had very high level of capacity of response. Australia's National Action Plan for Health Security 2019-2023 was developed to help to implement the recommendations from the JEE.

Since the Frankish conquest in the late 8th century, there were several administrative changes in those regions. Territory along the river Danube, from the river Enns to the Vienna Woods, was ruled directly, as a frontier extension (march) of the Frankish Bavaria, while regions further to the east, up to the river R√°ba, were initially designated to remaining Avarian princes, under the Frankish supreme rule. During the 820s and 830s, additional administrative changes were made in the wider region of Frankish Pannonia, inhabited mainly by Slavs. Territories of the remaining Avarian princes were fully incorporated, and Avars eventually disappeared from the region. Later during the 9th century, the region was contested between Eastern Frankish Kingdom and Great Moravia, while at the very beginning of the 10th century it was invaded and conquered by the Magyars. After the Battle of Lechfeld (955), territories along the river Danube, from the river Enns to the Vienna Woods, were reconquered by Germans, and new march was established (c. 972) thus creating the nucleus of the Margraviate of Austria. History Avars, from the 7th to the 9th century During the 8th century, Avarian rule in the regions along the river Danube stretched towards the west up to the river Enns, bordering Bavaria. In 788, Franks have establish direct rule over Bavaria, thus provoking neighbouring Avars. During the same year, Avars made an incursion into Bavaria, but Franko-Bvarian forces succeeded in repelling them, and then launched a counterattack towards neighbouring Avarian territories, situated along Danube, eastern from Enns. Two sides clashed near the river Ybbs, on the Ybbs Field (), where Avars suffered a major defeat (788). =Frankish offensives= In order to secure eastern borders, Charlemagne came to Bavaria in person, during the autumn of the same year (788). He held a council in Regensburg and regulated several issues regarding Bavarian frontier regions (marches), thus preparing the basis for future actions towards the east. In 790, Avars tried to negotiate a peace settlement with Franks, but no agreement was reached. In 791, large Frankish army, led by Charlemagne, crossed from Bavaria in to the Avarian territory beyond the river Enns. Frankish army was advancing along the river Danube, divided in two columns, but neither of them found any active resistance, and soon both reached the region of Vienna Woods, at the gates of the Pannonian Plain. No decisive battles were fought, since Avars had retreated deeper into Pannonia, allowing Franks to advance up to the river R√°ba. In 796, Frankish forces under Charlemagne's son, king Pepin of Italy (d. 810) launched a major offensive into central Pannonia. Frankish army allied with local Slavs, reached the river Drava, crossed the river Danube to the east and destroyed the main Avarian fortress called the Ring of the Avars. Avarian might was decisively crushed and their khagan became a Frankish vassal, while the remaining Avars retreated behind the river Tisza. Those victories were perpetuated by the epic poem De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica. Frankish campaigns against Avars were also described in the Vita Karoli Magni. =New frontier administration= Successful Frankish conquests and acquisition of new territories, particularly those between the river Enns and the Vienna Woods, and further towards the river R√°ba, represented a significant gain for the security of the Frankish state, and particularly for Bavaria. At first, new territories in Upper Pannonia were placed under the jurisdiction of Bavarian prefect Gerold (d. 799), and subsequently organized as a frontier unit, that became known as the (Bavarian) Easten March () or Avarian Province (). It provided safety for Bavarian eastern borders, also securing main communication between Frankish Bavaria and Pannonia. In the same time, further to the south, neighbouring Carantania, Carniola and southeastern Pannonian regions (Lower Pannonia) were left under the administration of their conqueror, king Pepin of Italy. Those regions were governed as frontier territories and dependencies of the March of Friuli. Thus, at the beginning of the 9th century, Frankish possessions in Pannonia were governed from two centers: Frankish administration in Bavaria was in charge of the northwestern regions of Pannonia (Avarian March in Upper Pannonia), while Frankish administration in Italy was in charge of the southern and eastern regions (Lower Pannonia with Slavic dependencies). In 803, situation in Pannonian regions demanded another Frankish intervention. Charlemagne came to Bavaria and dispatched an army to the east, headed by new Bavarian prefect Audulf and frontier count Werner, commander of the eastern march, whose seat was in Lorch (ancient roman Lauriacum, on the confluence of Enns and Danube). The campaign was successful, and by the end of the same year several Avarian and Slavic lords from Pannonia came to Regensburg, to pay personal homage to Charlrmagne. During those years, territory along the river Danube, between Enns and Vienna Woods, was ruled directly, as a frontier extension (march) of the Frankish Bavaria, while regions further to the east, up to the river R√°ba, were designated to remaining Avarian princes, Theodor (d. 805) and Abraham. Avarian princes converted to Christianity and continued to govern their people under the Frankish supreme rule, in the regions of Upper Pannonia, between Carnuntum and Savaria (modern Szombathely, in Humgary). In 811, another Frankish expedition was sent to the east, this time in order to settle ongoing disputes between Avars and Slavs in Danubian regions of Pannonia. In the autumn of the same year, several Avarian and Slavic lords came to Aachen, in order to resolve mutual disputes in front of the Charlrmagne, thus reaffirming their submission to the supreeme Frankish rule. =Administrative changes= Louis of Bavaria, that included (since 828) all southeastern frontier regions In 817, new emperor Louis I (d. 840) decided to regulate (in advance) various issues related to succession, including the question of governance over dependent peoples on Frankish eastern frontiers. Announcing the future division of Frankish provinces among his three sons, the emperor decided to bestow his young son Louis (d. 876) with prospect of Bavaria, including the rule over dependent Avars and Slavs (Bohemians and Carantanians). Since prince Louis was still underage, those provisions were not put into immediate effect, but they heralded an important change: from the time of late king Pepin (d. 810), dependent Slavic regions in Carantania and southern Pannonia were not governed from Frankish Bavaria, but from Frankish Italy, as territories dependent to the March of Friuli. When prince Louis finally became of age in 825-826, those regions were still under administration of his older brother Lothar I (d. 855), ruler of Italy, and his frontier commander, duke Baldric of Friuli. Upon receiving Bavarian royal crown in 826, young king Louis also wanted to take charge (as soon as possible) of all other regions that were promised to him in 817. Very soon, he got the chance to achieve that goal, and concentrate in his hands governance over Bavaria and Carantania, including all eastern and southeastern marches and dependent Avarian and Slavic territories. In 827-828, king Lothar of Italy and duke Baldric of Friuli failed to secure southeastern frontiers from Bulgarian intrusions, and because of that emperor Louis decided to detach those regions from the jurisdiction of the March of Friuli, placing Carantania and adjacent regions under the charge of Louis of Bavaria (828). At that point, king Louis of Bavaria became direct ruler of entire Frankish southeast, that included Bavaria and Carantania with all eastern marches and dependent Avarian and Slavic regions throughout Pannonia. =The aftermath= Unified under Louis of Bavaria (828), entire Frankish southeast became linked to the emerging Eastern Frankish Kingdom, and was subsequently reorganized as the March of Pannonia. During the 830s and 840s, further administrative changes were made in the wider region of Frankish Pannonia, that was by then inhabited mainly by Slavs. By that time, territories of the remaining Avarian princes were fully incorporated into regular administrative structure, and Avars eventually disappeared from the region. Avarian designation for the march also disappeared, and by the 850s, the entire region to the east from Bavaria was already known as the Bavarian wasteland. In the aftermath, within the further internal subdivisions of the Frankish Empire, Bavaria and southeastern frontier regions remained linked to the Eastern Frankish Kingdom. By the middle of the 9th century, Frankish rule in the region was contested by the Slavic princes of Great Moravia. At the very beginning of the 10th century, the region was invaded and conquered by the Magyars. After the Battle of Lechfeld (955), territories along the river Danube, from the river Enns to the Vienna Woods, were reconquered by Germans, and new Bavarian Easten March () was established (c. 972) thus creating the nucleus of the Margraviate of Austria.

Shortly afterward, he was involved in a kickboxing tournament on the Gold Coast and was shot in the chin. In the days before the killing of Brendan Keilar, Hudson had fired at police in Campbellfield after a night of car driving with Collingwood footballer Alan Didak. On 28 June, Didak was interviewed by police about this incident. Didak claimed that he was intoxicated at the time, was not in control of the situation and was concerned for his safety. The shootings Hudson spent the night of 17 June 2007 drinking at the Spearmint Rhino in King Street. Early in the morning of 18 June, he assaulted stripper Autumn Daly- Holt, a workmate of his girlfriend, 24-year-old Kara Douglas. He then called Douglas, who arrived to pick him up around 7:30 a.m. Hudson dragged her out onto the street by her hair. At the corner of William Street and Flinders Lane, two male bystanders, 43-year-old solicitor Brendan Keilar and 25-year- old Dutch backpacker Paul de Waard attempted to assist Douglas. Hudson pulled a gun and shot all three. Keilar was fatally wounded in the head. de Waard and Douglas were shot in the upper body. Douglas later had a kidney removed as a result of her injuries. Douglas, from Sydney, had been staying in the Punt Hill apartments on Flinders Lane. Hudson fled the scene as Keilar died in the street, dumping his weapon and jacket in a nearby construction site on Flinders Street between Queen and Bond Streets, where they were found by a construction worker about an hour later. The Rialto Towers were evacuated amid reports that the gunman had fled into the tower, sparking a level-to-level search. His car was discovered abandoned on Flinders Lane between Swanston and Elizabeth Streets. The black Honda CRV with New South Wales licence plates was revealed to be one vehicle owned by the gunman. His other vehicle was a black Mercedes-Benz sedan, later found in Richmond. Still high from a drug binge, Hudson fled to a Hells Angels safehouse north of the city. At 5:00 p.m. on 20 June, he surrendered himself to Victorian Police at Wallan, walking into the police station without incident. Homicide squad detectives transferred him to Melbourne where he was charged with murder and other offences in an out of court hearing. Aftermath and trial Hudson was to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, but was unable to make it due to an injury to his forearm that required surgery. The magistrate ordered that Hudson be remanded into custody. The formal charges were: one charge of murder in relation to Brendan Keilar, two charges of attempted murder in relation to Kara Douglas and Paul de Waard, one charge of intentionally causing serious injury in relation to Autumn Daly-Holt and one charge of unlawful imprisonment. He was later also charged with nine offences in relation to the shooting incident involving Collingwood Magpies player Alan Didak. In May 2009, allegations came to light that Hudson had been tortured by members of the Hell's Angels for bringing unwanted police attention to the group. The claimant alleges a club tattoo was burned from his forearm with a blowtorch before he surrendered to police. The story arose after police raided the Angels' clubhouse in Sydney and took possession of a Harley Davidson motorcycle apparently owned by Hudson. This story was denied by Victoria Police and was further discredited when Hudson's stepmother sent a recent photograph, clearly showing the club tattoo, to the ABC program Media Watch. Paul de Waard returned to the Netherlands to recover from his injuries. In October 2007, he revealed on a television interview that he was still undergoing extensive rehabilitation. He also made an appearance in the Dutch television show In de schaduw van het nieuws (In the shadow of the news) on 21 November 2009.

The police, the judicial system, politicians, prosecutors and citizens rely on the Chicago Crime Commission to provide advice on crime issues and to communicate vital information to the public.  Summary  Founded just before Prohibition in the Roaring '20s, local businessmen formed the Chicago Crime Commission to address the lawlessness prevalent in Chicago during the time. The businessmen who founded the crime commission did not think of themselves as a reform organization but saw crime as business work to which they applied business methods. The backlog of murder cases awaiting trial was reduced, while the public corruption and organized criminal activities of the Chicago Outfit were exposed. In 1930, the Commission first brought about the Public Enemies list, with Chicago gangster Al Capone as \\"Public Enemy Number One.\\" The idea of such a list was co-opted by the FBI as the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Today, the Commission's primary role is to ensure that business, government and law enforcement work together to address problems caused by organized criminal enterprises by: * Publishing The Gang Book, a training tool for law enforcement on adult Chicago area gangs which includes full color photographs of the \\"leaders\\" of \\"prominent\\" street gangs as well as their commonly identifiable characteristics (i.e., graffiti and markings, clothing, tattoos, and hand signs or \\"sets\\"); * Publishing Friend and Foe, described as \\"an exhibit of visual materials that highlight some aspects\\" of the \\"history of crime, citizen action, and law enforcement in Chicago\\" (Forward, p. iii). The work provides \\"insight into the \\"Chicago Outfit\\", public corruption, street gangs, drugs, and the evolution of crime fighting\\"; * Offering tools for citizens to report public corruption and crime anonymously to the right law enforcement agency through an interactive website and hotline; * Promoting Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a \\"promising\\" comprehensive antiviolence initiative. In their national evaluation, McGarrell and colleagues (2010) found cities who implemented PSN experienced an average 4.1 percent decline in violent crime, while non-PSN cities experienced a 0.9 percent decline; * Advising statewide and local partnerships on how to improve communications to prevent and respond to everyday crimes and organized criminal activities; * Conducting research and providing analysis on crime issues, specializing in those businesses associated with organized criminal activity; and * Offering a comprehensive organized crime library.  Highlights  * The Chicago Crime Commission spearheaded educating Illinois citizens on the dangers of a government-owned casino as the Illinois Governor and the Illinois General Assembly sought to pass legislation creating a Chicago-owned casino, increasing the total number of casinos, allowing slot machines at the racetracks and massively expanding gambling throughout Illinois. * The Commission's then President, James W. Wagner, testified as an expert witness in the federal government's 2007 prosecution of Chicago organized crime in the case known as the \\"Family Secrets\\" trial. * The Commission monitors the federal prosecutions of Illinois' alleged pay-to-play political insiders and the general public corruption allegations levied against government officials throughout Illinois, including the trials involving former Governor George H. Ryan, his former Chief-of-Staff, Scott Fawell and current Chicago businessman Antoin Rezko.  Publications and archives  Owning one of the oldest and most complete historical archives on organized crime in the 20th and 21st century, the Commission provides an important historical record of criminal activity and public corruption for professional research and education. The Chicago Crime Commission maintains current information on crime issues and criminal activities involving organized crime, gangs and public corruption. Recent publications include: The Gang Book (2012) and Friend and Foe (2007). * The Gang Book is a 272-page overview of adult Chicago area gangs which includes gang \\"histories\\", full color photographs of the \\"leaders\\" of \\"prominent\\" street gangs, as well as their commonly identifiable characteristics (i.e., graffiti and markings, clothing, tattoos, and hand signs or \\"sets\\"). Designed as a training tool, the Commission claims to have \\"donated over 4,000 copies\\" of the 2012 edition to local and statewide law enforcement agencies as well as other \\"organizations in the criminal justice field\\". * Friend and Foe is a 297-page \\"exhibit of visual materials that highlight some aspects\\" of the \\"history of crime, citizen action, and law enforcement in Chicago\\" (Forward, p. iii). The work provides \\"insight into the \\"Chicago Outfit\\", public corruption, street gangs, drugs, and the evolution of crime fighting\\". It includes a decade-by-decade pictorial of Chicago's crime problems, included \\"original photographs, cartoons, [newspaper] headlines, lithographs, fingerprints, drawings\\" (Forward, p. iii) and \\"previously unseen documents\\" from the Commission's historical archive.  Crime reporting  A non-government agency, the Commission acts an intermediary between citizens and law enforcement to help initiate investigations. The Anonymous Public Corruption Reporting Hotline is a web-based public corruption and crime reporting system that gives government employees and concerned citizens an effective way to reach law enforcement anonymously. The Anonymous Crime Reporting Hotline accepts tips on general and gang-related criminal activities.  Public activities  The Chicago Crime Commission presents and sponsors presentations on current law enforcement issues and criminal justice issues, continuing its track record of exposing corruption and organized criminal activities and encouraging public debate on issues of public safety and national security. The Chicago Crime Commission hosts at least four events a year open to the public: (1) a mid-year member luncheon, (2) a golf benefit; (3) an annual dinner benefit; and (4) a holiday luncheon. The Commission accepts* sponsorship and event purchases online at http://www.chicagocrimecommission.org (*subject to availability and security clearance).  Funding & Expenses  As a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, the Commission receives funding solely from private citizens and businesses committed to improving the quality of public safety in their communities. Per the Illinois Attorney General's \\"Charitable Database Search\\", the Commission reported an annual income of roughly $500,000 in 2014 and 2015 [Reg. Number: 01008852; EIN: 360898425]. In 2014, Executive Director Joseph Ways was compensated $167,000 while retiring Vice-President Arthur Bilek collected a salary of $87,000.

The attraction uses much of the same features as the first incarnation of the high-speed giant slot car ride used in its first and third incarnation of this ride system. Original music for the ride was created by longtime Disney composer Buddy Baker. Story The volcano of Mysterious Island, Mount Prometheus, has become Captain Nemo's base. After traveling through its caverns and past several of Nemo's labs (which includes a diary entry of the discovery of the fossilized egg of a monstrous, unknown arthropod), guests board \\"Terravators\\" (elevators) to the facility's base station one-half mile below. In this base station is a huge steam-powered bellows that pumps fresh air down from the surface, massive spring-pillars that hold the ceiling up to prevent cave-ins in case of earthquakes, and communication center which is currently giving warnings of increased seismic activity, but the scientist who mans it is currently away on a tea break. Riders then board steam-powered mine vehicles that travel through pre-drilled tunnels into the heart of the Earth. The ride begins through a cavern of colorful glowing crystals, before entering a giant Mushroom Forest, which is inhabited by strange insect and amphibian-like life forms. Before the car can proceed further, an earthquake causes a cave-in of the tunnel ahead, forcing the car off its planned route and down a side branch filled with giant egg-like sacks that appears to have been dug by a gigantic creature. The car emerges on the shore of the Subterranean Sea, and is nearly struck by a lightning from the electrified gas clouds. The finale comes when riders are forced into the fiery heart of an active volcano, where the riders come face- to-face with the giant, tyrannical centipede-like lava monster that has built a nest there, before escaping back to the surface on the wave of an eruption. History Journey to the Center of the Earth was originally planned as a free-fall type ride as part of Discovery Mountain, a former Disneyland Paris concept in place of Space Mountain. Since it was never built, this project reemerged in Tokyo DisneySea with new technology from Test Track, a thrill ride through a GM testing facility at that time. The score of the ride was composed by Buddy Baker, who was also responsible for the scores of rides such as Pirates of The Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion.

Fictional character biography =Golden/Silver age= Mala was one of the most important Amazons in the Golden Age adventures of Wonder Woman. Mala was with Diana when they discovered Steve Trevor floating in the sea, and they worked together to bring him to shore. Mala was also the last Amazon standing alongside a masked Diana during the contest to determine who would venture into Man's World as the Amazon champion.All-Star Comics #8; Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #1 Mala became the head of the Reform Island program for rehabilitating criminals and the criminally insane. She was typically depicted as blonde and wearing a polka dotted dress. Mala possessed her own plane, the Swan Plane, which was superfast though not as fast as Wonder Woman's invisible plane nor telepathically controlled. Mala was also one of the few Amazons to venture into Man's World, though by accident, when her plane was hijacked by Mimi Mendez.Sensation Comics #29 Mala was skilled enough in the Amazons' advanced science to be trusted by Wonder Woman to work alongside Paula to perfect a device Wonder Woman created to install telepathic controls in the invisible plane.Sensation Comics #24 Mala was largely forgotten in the Silver Age, although she reappeared in several dream sequences exploring what-if scenarios.Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #300 In one, Diana was forced to assume the throne of Paradise Island immediately prior to the Contest, and Mala won to become Wonder Woman. =Modern age= Due to the 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline, the previously established history of almost all DC Comics characters ceased to exist and was restarted. In Mala's case, she was re- introduced in 1992 as part of an illusion spell the White Magician cast on Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman Annual #3 In the illusion Diana imagined herself on Themyscira where Mala and several other Amazons were debasing themselves before male visitors to the island. The real Mala was officially introduced later as a close friend of Diana's. It was revealed that Mala participated in the original Contest to become Wonder Woman (losing to Diana)Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #0 (October 1994) as well as in the second Contest (which was lost to Artemis).Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #92 =Mala of Bana-Mighdall= Mala of Bana- Mighdall Art by Mike Deodato.Another Amazon named Mala was introduced as a member of the Bana-Mighdall tribe. Though Amazon born, her tribe was not blessed with immortality. Because of this she was born sometime in the early to mid- twentieth century and lived the general life-span of a common mortal. Within her tribe she is a historian and is sometimes referred to as \\"The Keeper\\" as she is also responsible for watching over a bust statue of her tribe's first queen, Antiope. Mala was already an old woman when the witch Circe granted her tribe immortality. Unfortunately Mala's eyesight was greatly diminished after a battle with a demon who spit fire into her face. It was Mala who informed Wonder Woman that she looks identical to the long dead Antiope, Wonder Woman's aunt. As her tribe's historian Mala was shown standing with her people as they requested permission from Queen Hippolyta to participate in the Contest to choose a new Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #91 At Diana's request she allowed the bust statue to be temporarily moved from the Bana-Mighdallian tabernacle to the Themyscirian royal throne room. Whether she was aware that the bust was moved yet again to a wooded clearing on Themyscira is unknown but likely. Mala's present status, as well as that of the bust, is unknown. =DC Rebirth= After the events of DC Rebirth, Mala was not initially seen among the Amazons on Themyscira. However, Diana later mentioned Mala to the former criminal Mayfly, telling her stories of when they would play games on Themyscira.Wonder Woman #51 (2018) Other versions =Wonder Woman: Earth One= Mala appears in Wonder Woman: Earth One in a similar manner to her original counterpart, though this time presented as Princess Diana's lover and the Wonder Woman before her.Wonder Woman: Earth One =Injustice: Gods Among Us= Mala appears in the comic series based on the Injustice 2 video game.Injustice 2 #29 (2017) Abilities =Mala of Themyscira= Mala has 3,000 years of combat experience providing her expertise in both hand-to-hand combat as well as with hand held weapons. As a Themyscirian Amazon she also possesses immortality that allows her to live indefinitely in a youthful form, but does leave her open to potential injury and death depending on her actions.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #1 Mala, as a Themyscirian, also possesses enhanced strength and intelligence. As shown by fellow members of her tribe, she has the capability to break apart steel and concrete with her bare hands,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #59 jump over 12 feet from a standing position,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #57 has a high durability factor,Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War #1 enhanced healing,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #30 (May 1989) and the ability to absorb and process a vast amount of knowledge in a short period of time.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #3 Mala, like all Themyscirian Amazons, possesses the ability to relieve her body of physical injury and toxins by becoming one with the Earth's soil and then reforming her body whole again. During writer John Byrne's time on the comic it was stated that this is a very sacred ritual to the Themyscirians, only to be used in the most dire of circumstances.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #120 =Mala of Bana-Mighdall= As with other members of her tribe, Mala has average to above average human level strength, stamina and reflexes. As she was able to survive battling the likes of demons, Mala's durability level is higher than average for someone her age. Despite being an old woman, Mala has ageless immortality that allows her to remain the same age for all time, but leaves her open to possibly dying as it does not provide invulnerability. As a Bana, Mala would be trained in hand-to- hand battle as well as the use and manufacturing of weapons. In other media =Television= * In 1976 the television series Wonder Woman aired the two-part episode The Feminum Mystique. In the episode an Amazon very similar to Mala was introduced named Magda. She is played by actress Pamela Susan Shoop. =Film= * In the animated film Justice League: New Frontier, Diana debates and spars with a blonde rival Amazon before the Centre appears and devastates Paradise Island. Given the equal ability of both combatants (she is able to wound Diana with her sword), and their readiness to put their dispute aside when threatened, this is most probably Mala, although she is not mentioned by name, and is voiced by Vanessa Marshall (credited as Amazon Woman). =Video games= * Mala is scheduled to appear in the DC Universe Online video game. In the game, she and fellow Amazon Pythia direct game players to various quests. =Novels= * Mala was written to be a finalist in the Contest to be Wonder Woman in the novel \\"Wonder Woman\\" by S. D. Perry and Britta Dennison. (January 2009) Pocket Star Publishing. The book is based on the animated film Wonder Woman, released in March 2009. Despite being named in the book as Diana's final competitor, Mala was only shown and not specifically named in the film it was based on.

To perform a bogie exchange, a car is converted from one gauge to another by removing the bogies or trucks (the chassis containing the wheels and axles of the car), and installing a new bogie with differently spaced wheels. It is generally limited to wagons and carriages, though the bogies on diesel locomotives can be exchanged if enough time is available. Bogies exchange operation in Ussuriisk (near Vladivostok) at the Chinese-Russian border Bogie change station at Chop, Ukraine station, Ukraine, which connects to Hungary and Slovakia Wagons and carriages Bogie wagons can have their gauge changed by lifting them off one set of bogies and putting them back down again on another set of bogies. The pin that centres the bogies and the hoses and fittings for the brakes must be compatible. A generous supply of bogies of each gauge is needed to accommodate the ebb and flow of traffic. The bogies and wagons also need to have standardized hooks, etc., where they may be efficiently lifted. The two wheel sets on four-wheel wagons can be changed as well if the wagon has been designed accordingly. Engines = Steam = Steam engines can be designed for more than one gauge, by having, for example, reversible wheel hubs that suit two alternative gauges. This was done in the 1930s and beyond in Victoria for possible gauge conversion, though no engines were ever converted in this manner other than one heritage engine (R766). Some Garratt locomotives of East Africa were designed for easy conversion to gauge, though again none ever was. In 1944, the LMS re-gauged a pair of \\"Jinty\\" 0-6-0 tank locomotives - originally built to UK - for use on its gauge Northern Counties Committee (NCC) lines in Northern Ireland; re-designated as Class Y, they largely undertook shunting work on dockyard lines in Belfast. The re-gauging was performed by simply reversing the wheel centres so that the spokes dished outwards. In the southern United States, some steam locomotives built by Baldwin were designed for easy conversion from to . =Diesel= Diesel locomotives have bogies like wagons and carriages, only with more cables for the traction motors and take a little longer to convert. In Australia, some classes of diesel locomotives are regularly gauge-converted to suit traffic requirements on the , , and networks. Since the networks are not all connected to each other, being separated by deserts or lines of other gauges, they are bogie-exchanged or piggybacked on road or rail vehicles when transferred between these networks. Raising or lowering = Raise = The simplest way to carry out bogie exchange is to lift the wagons off the bogies and replace them back on new bogies. This may require the wagons in a train to be uncoupled, and continuous brakes disconnected. As the bogies are swung out of the way, they sway, which wastes time settling them down. =Lower= Another way of carrying out bogie exchange is to lower the bogies onto a trolley in a pit, after which the trolleys are rolled out of the way and others return. This keeps the train couplings and continuous brakes connected. In addition, the bogies never need leave a solid surface, so they can be wheeled in and out more quickly. This method was used at Dry Creek railway station, Adelaide.Catch Point - November 2007 - p35 - picture of lowering method International =Australia= Between 1961 and 1995, Australia had five bogie exchange centres, which opened and closed as gauge conversion work proceeded. The gauges served were and , though the Queensland did acquire 100 bogie-exchange compatible QLX wagons just in case. All the wagons involved had wagon codes ending in \\"X\\", such as VLX.

Transfer time  Bogie exchange conversion times were: * Dynon, Australia - one rail car every 7.3 minutes * Brest - one rail car takes less than 1 hour * Zabaykalsk - one rail car takes 5‚Äì6 hours * Erenhot - one rail car takes 5‚Äì6 hours * Cairo, Illinois - in 1874, 16-18 freight cars per hour (2 at a time), 15 minutes per Pullman car  Variable gauge axles  Variable-gauge axles in an automatic track gauge changeover system (ATGCS) is a newer development and is faster than bogie exchange. The SUW 2000 ATGCS requires a changeover track about 20 m long, with a shed if snow is around compared to a small marshalling yard required by bogie exchange.

The name is derived from the Ancient Greek: œÑ·øÜŒªŒµ tƒìle \\"far away\\" and ŒºŒ≠œÑœÅŒøŒΩ m√©tron \\"something used to measure\\". Originally optical devices used in surveying, they soon found applications in other fields, such as photography and in the military. They were specially useful for finding the range of a target, such as in naval gunnery and anti-aircraft artillery. Designs German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee's salvaged telemeter on display in Montevideo. World War II era telemeters worked optically with two telescopes focused on the same target but a distance apart along a baseline. The range to the target is found by measuring the difference in bearing of the two telescopes and solving the skinny triangle. Solutions can be obtained automatically, using tables or, rarely, manual calculation. The greater the distance to the target, the longer the baseline needs to be for accurate measurement. The baseline required for the telemeters for battleship guns is very large. More modern telemeters use an electronic technology such as lasers or radar. The first rangefinder telemeter was invented by James Watt in 1769 and put to use in 1771 in surveying canals. Watt called his instrument a micrometer, a term now used with a different meaning in engineering. It consisted of two parallel hairs in the focal plane of a telescope eyepiece crossing an upright hair. At the point to be measured, two sliding targets on a surveyor's rod were adjusted to align with the hairs in the telescope. The distance to the rod could then be determined from the distance between the targets on the rod by trigonometry H. W. Dickinson, James Watt: Craftsman and Engineer, Cambridge University Press, 2010 . (p. 56, 75-76). Several others have been credited with the invention of the rangefinder telemeter at one time or another. The Royal Society of Arts gave an award to W. Green for its invention in 1778, even though they were made aware of Watt's priority (p. 76-77). In 1778 Georg Friedrich Brander invented the coincidence telemeter. Two mirrors set a distance apart horizontally in a long slim box, similar to a subtense bar but located at the measuring station, and forming two images. This rangefinder does not require a measuring rod at the target and could perhaps be considered the first true telemeter. In 1790 Jesse Ramsden invented a half-image range finder. Alexander Selligue is often mistakenly credited with the invention, he did invent an improved telemeter with fixed lenses in 1821 and is responsible for coining the term.Johann Gottfried Dingler, Polytechnisches Journal, vol. 8, page 121, Stuttgart: Cotta 1822 (in German)A.

The toxin may be considered a virulence factor, since it is crucial for the virulence of L. monocytogenes. Biochemistry Listeriolysin O is a non-enzymatic, cytolytic, thiol-activated, cholesterol-dependent, pore-forming toxin protein; hence, it is activated by reducing agents and inhibited by oxidizing agents. However, LLO differs from other thiol-activated toxins, since its cytolytic activity is maximized at a pH of 5.5. By maximizing activity at a pH of 5.5, LLO is selectively activated within the acidic phagosomes (average pH ~ 5.9) of cells that have phagocytosed L. monocytogenes. After LLO lyses the phagosome, the bacterium escapes into the cytosol, where it can grow intracellularly. Upon release from the phagosome, the toxin has reduced activity in the more basic cytosol. Hence, LLO permits L. monocytogenes to escape from phagosomes into the cytosol without damaging the plasma membrane of the infected cell. This allows the bacteria to live intracellularly, where they are protected from extracellular immune system factors such as the complement system and antibodies. LLO also causes dephosphorylation of histone H3 and deacetylation of histone H4 during the early phases of infection, prior to entry of L. monocytogenes into the host cell. The pore-forming activity is not involved in causing the histone modifications. The alterations of the histones cause the down regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Thus, LLO may be important in subverting the host immune response to L. monocytogenes. A PEST-like sequence is present in LLO and is considered essential for virulence, since mutants lacking the sequence lysed the host cell. However, contrary to PEST's supposed role in protein degradation, evidence suggests that the PEST-like sequence may regulate LLO production in the cytosol rather than increase degradation of LLO. Regulation of expression Listeriolysin O is encoded by the gene hly, which is part of a pathogenicity island called LIPI-1.Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria. \\"Pathogenicity islands in Listeria: LIPI-1.\\" State Key Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Genetic Engineering, Beijing, China. Last accessed June 18, 2007. Transcription of hly, as well as other virulence factors of L. monocytogenes within LIPI-1, is activated by the protein encoded by prfA gene. prfA is thermoregulated by the PrfA thermoregulator UTR element, such that translation of prfA maximally occurs at 37 ¬∞C and is nearly silent at 30 ¬∞C. Since 37 ¬∞C is within the range of normal body temperature, PrfA protein, as well as listeriolysin O and other virulence factors regulated by PrfA, is only produced when L. monocytogenes is in a host. Medical application A recombinant BCG vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is being developed that expresses Listeriolysin O and lacks Urease C. The ŒîureC hly+ rBCG vaccine has significantly higher protection than the original BCG strain due to improved antigen presentation. Listeriolysin creates pores in the phagosome and allows the bacteria to escape into the cytosol, so antigens can be presented on both Class I and Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex and activate CD8 and CD4 T-cells respectively. Urease produces ammonia and creates a basic environment which inhibits listeriolysin activity, so it is knocked out to provide the optimal pH.

Few people had more influence on Billy Graham than Bell.The Billy Graham Museum; Wheaton, Illinois Life and work Bell was born in Longdale, Virginia, the son of Ruth Lee (McCue) and James Harvey Bell. Bell and his wife, Virginia Myers (Leftwich) Bell, served as Presbyterian medical missionaries in China from 1916 to 1941 with the American Southern Presbyterian Mission. They lived on the compound of Love and Mercy Hospital in Qingjiangpu, Jiangsu Province, 300 miles north of Shanghai. They had five children: Rosa, Ruth, Lemuel, Virginia, and Clayton. Bell kept a busy schedule as surgical chief and administrative superintendent at the hospital. Although the hospital had a pastor on staff, Bell made the healing of souls a priority in his work, gently explaining the Gospel to his patients.Decision Today ‚Äì Special Commemorative Issue ‚Äì Ruth Bell Graham, 2007, p.6 He never minimized the importance of addressing the spiritual needs of the people as well as their physical needs. The Bells returned to the United States before Pearl Harbor in 1941 and retired in Montreat, North Carolina, across the street from their daughter Ruth and Billy Graham. In 1942, Bell founded The Southern Presbyterian Journal, a publication which championed conservative Presbyterianism within the denomination that had sent Bell and his family to China as missionaries. From 1942 to 1966, the Southern Presbyterian Journal also championed racial segregation. Historian Kenneth Taylor describes this segregationist stance: \\"Paternalistic Journalers professed to love African Americans and to want only the best for them. Integration, the writers insisted, was cruel, and segregation was kind. Thus, social separation was consistent with the Golden Rule, 'to do unto others as you want others to do unto you.' In 1947 Bell wrote without irony that he was 'ashamed at the intolerance, the discrimination, and the humiliations which have been heaped on them [blacks] by the white race' while he defended segregation. ‚Ä¶ Segregation was kind and Christian.\\" After Bell's death, and the subsequent founding of the Presbyterian Church in America, this publication would eventually evolve into the God's World News line of children's magazines, founded in 1981 under the direction of Joel Belz, and later lead to the 1986 founding of a parallel news publication for adults, WORLD Magazine. Bell was also the one who suggested to Billy Graham the idea of the periodical that would eventually be named Christianity Today. He became its executive editor, commuting regularly to Washington from his home in Montreat and writing \\"A Layman and His Faith,\\" a regular column in the magazine.Graham, B., Just As I Am: The Autobiography of Billy Graham, 1997, p.288, HarperCollins Worldwide, With his son-in-law, he was extremely active in trying to mobilize evangelicals to support Richard Nixon against Roman Catholic John F.

He was a member of the British Columbia Provincial Police and owned a roadhouse and many other properties in Williams Lake, British Columbia. Early years Pinchbeck was born in Great Steeping, Lincolnshire, England in 1831. He was the fifth of the 13 children born to Robert Pinchbeck and Jane Anne Anderson. At the age of 18, he moved to San Francisco, United States where he operated a roadhouse during the California Gold Rush. He would later travel north to Victoria, British Columbia, Canada where he joined the British Columbia Provincial Police.The Pinchbeck Family Williams Lake In 1860, during the Cariboo Gold Rush, Pinchbeck accompanied Gold Commissioner Philip Henry Nind to Williams Lake to create a local government and bring law and order to the area. Nind had originally considered Fort Alexandria for this purpose but chose Williams Lake instead as it was at a junction of two main pack trails: one from the Douglas Road and another through the Fraser Canyon. Like many provincial policemen of the era, Pinchbeck had to fulfill a variety of duties including Justice of the Peace, lawyer, judge, and jailer. Throughout 1861-1863, Pincheck, in partnership with Thomas Meldrum and William Lyne, formed Pinchbeck and Company and built a roadhouse, a general store, a sawmill a flour mill, a distillery and a horse racing track. The horse races often drew large crowds of spectators and on some of the biggest races the stakes could be as high as $100,000. Although the Cariboo Road would bypass Williams Lake in 1863, Pinchbeck stayed on in the area and continued to prosper and his roadhouse suffered no lack of business, particularly in the winter when it catered to local miners who stayed there until they could return to the goldfields in the spring. Pinchbeck's company would eventually own most of the Williams Lake Valley and his roadhouse prospered and became famous for its \\"White Wheat Whiskey\\" which came from Pinchbeck's own distillery and sold for 25 cents a shot. Domestic life In 1863, Pinchbeck would begin a common-law marriage with Chulminick, a local First Nations Shuswap woman, who may have been the daughter of Chief William, for whom Williams Lake is named. Their home was located where the Williams Lake Stampede Grounds are today. They had two sons, William Felix, born in 1867 and James, born in 1872. William Pinchbeck's \\"Lake House\\" and ranch (1890) In 1884, after returning to England, Pinchbeck married Alice Elizabeth Kilham and returned to Williams Lake where he built his new bride a ranch house on the lake, which they called the \\"Lake House\\" and was one of the finest homes in the Cariboo. The couple would have three sons, Robert in 1885, Fredrick in 1887, and Cyril in 1889. By the late 1880s both William Lyne and Thomas Meldrum had left the partnership and Pinchbeck had sole ownership of the entire valley. However, the Cariboo region's economy was by then beginning to decline. The initial excitement over the gold rush was long past and with no major roads running near Williams Lake, Pinchbeck's ranch and businesses were no longer profitable. Pinchbeck died on July 30 or 31st, 1893, and was buried in a plot overlooking Williams Lake.

Most of the information about the administration and government under the early Pandyas comes to use through Sangam literature.  The King and his court  The head of the Government was the king, a hereditary monarch, who ruled with unaided discretion. The ascension to the throne was normally hereditary, sometimes through usurpation and occasionally based on unusual methods of choosing a king such as sending out the royal elephant to select a person of its choice by garlanding them. The king could be crowned at any age and reigned as long as he chose to or lived. He was highly revered by his subjects and was even equated to God. The king, in turn, had onerous duties towards his subjects and was held responsible for any misfortune that befell them. The dynastic emblem of the Pandyas was the double carp, which was used for all official purposes of royal authentication. Coins issued by the kings, seals on letters as well as exported and imported cargo stocked in the ware houses at ports bore this emblem. The king's court consisted of royal officers like the ministers, generals, commanders and accountants. His power was restricted by the Aimberunguzhu (Tamil: ‡Æê‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ¥‡ØÅ) or the Five Great Assemblies. They consisted of the representatives of the people, priests, physicians, astrologers and the ministers. The council of representatives (Maasanam, Tamil: ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æ©‡ÆÆ‡Øç) safeguarded the rights and privileges of the people; the priests (Paarpar, Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç) directed all religious ceremonies; the physicians (Maruthar, Tamil: ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Øç) attended to all matters affecting the health of the king and his subjects; the astrologers (Nimithar, Tamil: ‡Æ®‡Æø‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Øç) fixed auspicious times for public ceremonies and predicted important events; the ministers (Amaichar, Tamil: ‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡Øà‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Æ∞‡Øç) attended to the collection of revenue and expenditure and also the administration of justice. There was another assembly of officials that served the king called the Enberaayam (Tamil: ‡Æé‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øá‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç) or the Eight Groups of Attendants. While some scholars believe it consisted of attendants on the king's person like the perfumers, dressing valets, etc., others believe it consisted of more important persons like the people of the capital city, the leaders of the elephant corps and of the cavalry. The principal officers of State were the high priest, the chief astrologer, the ministers and the commanders of the army.  Administration  The king divided his territory into a number of administrative units, each called a Koorram (Tamil: ‡Æï‡ØÇ‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ÆÆ‡Øç). It was further divided into provinces called Mandalam, which in turn was divided into many sub-provinces called Nadus, with each Nadu consisting of many villages. A locality inside a town or village was called Ur and each neighborhood inside an Ur was called a Cheri. While the king ruled over his entire territory from the capital, he often placed one or more principalities (Koorram) under the near-sovereign government of some senior member of the royal family or a feudatary. The Cilappatikaram mentions that while Nedunj Cheliyan I ruled from Madurai, his younger brother was placed in charge of the Korkai principality. The villages that come under a principality, were each governed by the elders in the respective villages, almost autonomously. This arrangement can be roughly equated to a central government (the king), under which operated a set of feudal governments (the principalities), which in turn oversaw the local governments (the villages). Madurai, the capital city from which the king ran the central government, was large, populous and prosperous. It had a simple police and sanitation system wherein the watchmen walked the streets, lamp in hand. The streets were kept clean by fresh sand being laid, thereon. Separate cheris existed for different sections of the society like the priests, merchants etc. Hospitals and educational institutions were set up by royal order or the philanthropy of the wealthy. The village was the most fundamental unit of administration under the Pandyas. The affairs of a village were the responsibility of its elders, who were not elected but were recognized and appointed based on their age and status in society. There were two institutions for managing the affairs of a village ‚Äì Ambalam and Manram, the only difference between the two being the locations from which they operated. The Manram or Podiyil was a simple structure around the foot of a tree in the centre of the village, while the Ambalam or Avai was a small building on a slightly raised platform. The functions of these institutions were judicial, administrative and financial ‚Äì they looked after the police duties, hearing and settling disputes, justice, sanitation, communicating royal orders, land surveys, revenue assessment and maintenance of roads and irrigation facilities. Only the transmission of locally collected taxes to the royal coffers was left to the king's revenue officers.  Judicial system  Justice was administered free of charge, by special officers appointed as judges and magistrates, but the king was supreme and the final arbiter in all civil and criminal cases. The monarchs prided themselves on the justness of their government. The Cilapatikaram mentions a Pandyan king who died of remorse on realizing his guilt of injustice. The officers appointed as judges were expected to be learned, straightforward, experienced and aged. Mortgage, lease, trust property, loans, breach of contract were some common sources of civil litigation, which had no time bar. Theft, adultery, forgery and treason were some types of criminal offences. In the capital city, dispensation of justice was organized by the king in his own court, while in the villages, it was the elders that meted out justice. The committees of justice in the village assemblies were the Nyayattars and they met under ceremonial trees to conduct the trial and pronounce judgements. Trials were mostly characterized by elaborate judicial procedure, setting down of evidence and judgement. However, there have been instances where the trial-by-ordeal system was practiced, in which the defendant was put through some form of torture and if he escaped unscathed, he was deemed innocent. The punishments were very severe and hence crimes were rare: one caught in the act of burglary, adultery or spying was given the death penalty and one giving false testimony would have his tongue cut off. Prisons were used to hold not only the guilty but also captives taken in war. Prisoners were chained and were watched over by warders. It was common practice to release prisoners on festive occasions and in some cases, they were asked to go into sea for pearl-fishing.  Military and warfare  The king was the chief commander of the army and usually led his army in the battlefield. The military was said to be fourfold : the infantry, the cavalry, the elephantry and the chariotry. A wide variety of war weapons filled the military arsenal including shields, swords, spears, tridents, maces, bows and arrows. A successful war could lead to annexation of territories or the submission of the enemy, who would then recognize the hegemony of the victor and start paying tributes. Battles of this age were of two kinds ‚Äì those fought in the open and those fought around a fort under siege. The Maduraikanci gives a vivid picture of the sophisticated defence mechanism that was in place to protect the fort of Madurai during siege warfare. There were four gates to the fort surmounted by high towers, with massive walls built of rough-hewn stone. Surrounding the fort on its outside was a deep moat and around the moat was a thick jungle of thorny trees. The roads leading to the gates of the fort were wide enough to permit several elephants to pass abreast. There were all kinds of weapons and missiles concealed on the walls on both the sides of the entrance, ready to be discharged on an enemy. Many curious engines were mounted on the battlements to shoot arrows or to fling stones on those that besiege them. There were machines like the fishing rod and angle to catch and drag up those that approach the wall and machines like iron fingers to seize and tear them to pieces. There were also furnaces from which hot oil and molten metal might be poured on those that attempt to scale the wall and iron spokes and spears to shove down those that might succeed in mounting the ramparts. While besieging a fort, the method adopted by the invading army was to first cut open a wide passage through the jungle around the fort, then fill up the moat to enable the army to approach the walls and finally scale the wall with ladders or break open the gates with the help of elephants trained to do the work. When the battle lines were drawn up, the elephants were placed first, the chariots and cavalry were ranged behind them and the infantry occupied the rear. The chariots and elephants carried the royalty and the generals that led the army and were armed with lances or swords and shields adorned with gold. The infantry consisted of archers and lancers who also carried swords and large bucklers. The cavalry carried lighter arms than the infantry. Since the elephants always formed the most formidable part of an army, it was deemed a great feat of valour to kill an enemy elephant.  Revenue and expenditure  The main sources of royal revenue were taxes, tributes, customs duties and tolls. Taxes were called Karai or Irai, tributes called Tirai and customs tolls and duties were called Sungam. Levy of taxes as well as expenditure was at the discretion of the king who decided the rate and incidence of taxes, as well as any remissions. Land tax, paid in money or in kind, and income tax, equal to one-sixth of an individual's income, were the major types of taxes collected. Other sources of revenue include tributes paid by feudal subordinates, war booty presents by loyal and visiting subjects, treasure troves besides land revenue, cess and forced gifts. Tolls were collected on the trunk-roads used by caravans and at the frontier of each kingdom. Customs were levied at seaports where the imported goods landed. The export of locally manufactured goods such as textiles, pearls etc. earned a lot of foreign exchange for the royal treasury. The king took one-tenth of the total earnings from pearl-diving and sale of pearls as his royalty. The items incurring expenditure for the king include the military, gifts to poets and temples, maintenance of educational and health services, building infrastructure such as roads and irrigation and the palace household expenses. Tax remission also deprived the king of some revenue. Expenses incurred in connection with the recruitment and maintenance of the army and waging of war were a considerable drain on the treasury. The palace consisted of not only the members of the royal family but a vast crowd of merchants, officials and entertainers all of whom had to be compensated for their services ‚Äì this was also a major item of expenditure.

The Book of Optics (; or Perspectiva; ) is a seven-volume treatise on optics and other fields of study composed by the medieval Arab scholar Ibn al-Haytham, known in the West as Alhazen or Alhacen (965‚Äìc. 1040 AD). The Book of Optics presented experimentally founded arguments against the widely held extramission theory of vision (as held by Euclid in his Optica), and proposed the modern intromission theory, the now accepted model that vision takes place by light entering the eye.D.

The book extensively affected the development of optics, physics and mathematics in Europe between the 13th and 17th centuries. Vision theory Before the Book of Optics was written, two theories of vision existed. The extramission or emission theory was forwarded by the mathematicians EuclidEuclid's Optics and Ptolemy,Smith, A. Mark (1988) \\"Ptolemy, Optics\\" Isis Vol. 79, No. 2 (Jun., 1988), pp. 188-207, via JSTOR *Smith, A.

Mark (1999) Ptolemy and the Foundations of Ancient Mathematical Optics: A Source Based Guided Study Transactions of the American Philosophical Society New Series, 89(3) (1999) via JSTOR who asserted that certain forms of radiation are emitted from the eyes onto the object which is being seen. When these rays reached the object they allowed the viewer to perceive its color, shape and size. An early version of the intromission theory, held by the followers of Aristotle and Galen, argued that sight was caused by agents, which were transmitted to the eyes from either the object or from its surroundings. Al- Haytham offered many reasons against the extramission theory, pointing to the fact that eyes can be damaged by looking directly at bright lights, such as the sun. He claimed the low probability that the eye can fill the entirety of space as soon as the eyelids are opened as an observer looks up into the night sky. Using the intromission theory as a foundation, he formed his own theory that an object emits rays of light from every point on its surface which then travel in all directions, thereby allowing some light into a viewer's eyes. According to this theory, the object being viewed is considered to be a compilation of an infinite number of points, from which rays of light are projected. Light and color theory In the Book of Optics, al-Haytham claimed the existence of primary and secondary light, with primary light being the stronger or more intense of the two. The book describes how the essential form of light comes from self-luminous bodies and that accidental light comes from objects that obtain and emit light from those self-luminous bodies. According to Ibn al-Haytham, primary light comes from self-luminous bodies and secondary light is the light that comes from accidental objects.A detailed study on Ibn al-Haytham's theory of colors is noted in: Nader El-Bizri, 'Ibn al-Haytham et le probl√®me de la couleur', Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et m√©di√©vales, C.N.R.S. 7 (2009), pp. 201‚Äì226. Accidental light can only exist if there is a source of primary light. Both primary and secondary light travel in straight lines. Transparency is a characteristic of a body that can transmit light through them, such as air and water, although no body can completely transmit light or be entirely transparent. Opaque objects are those through which light cannot pass through directly, although there are degrees of opaqueness which determine how much light can actually pass through. Opaque objects are struck with light and can become luminous bodies themselves which radiate secondary light. Light can be refracted by going through partially transparent objects and can also be reflected by striking smooth objects such as mirrors, traveling in straight lines in both cases. Al-Haytham presented many experiments in Optics that upheld his claims about light and its transmission. He also claimed that color acts much like light, being a distinct quality of a form and travelling from every point on an object in straight lines.Refer to: Nader El-Bizri, 'Ibn al-Haytham et le probl√®me de la couleur', Oriens- Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et m√©di√©vales, C.N.R.S. 7 (2009): 201‚Äì226; see also Nader El-Bizri, 'Grosseteste‚Äôs Meteorological Optics: Explications of the Phenomenon of the Rainbow after Ibn al-Haytham', in Robert Grosseteste and the Pursuit of Religious and Scientific Knowledge in the Middle Ages, eds. J. Cunningham and M. Hocknull (Dordrecht: Springer, 2016), pp. 21-39. Through experimentation he concluded that color cannot exist without air. Anatomy of the eye and visual process The structure of the human eye according to Ibn al-Haytham. Note the depiction of the optic chiasm. ‚ÄîManuscript copy of his KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir (MS Fatih 3212, vol. 1, fol. 81b, S√ºleymaniye Mosque Library, Istanbul) As objects radiate light in straight lines in all directions, the eye must also be hit with this light over its outer surface. This idea presented a problem for al- Haytham and his predecessors, as if this was the case, the rays received by the eye from every point on the object would cause a blurred image. Al-Haytham solved this problem using his theory of refraction. He argued that although the object sends an infinite number of rays of light to the eye, only one of these lines falls on the eye perpendicularly: the other rays meet the eye at angles that are not perpendicular. According to al-Haytham, this causes them to be refracted and weakened. He claimed that all the rays other than the one that hits the eye perpendicularly are not involved in vision. In al-Haytham's structure of the eye, the crystalline humor is the part that receives light rays from the object and forms a visual cone, with the object being perceived as the base of the cone and the center of the crystalline humor in the eye as the vertex. Other parts of the eye are the aqueous humor in front of the crystalline humor and the vitreous humor at the back. These, however, do not play as critical of a role in vision as the crystalline humor. The crystalline humor transmits the image it perceives to the brain through an optic nerve. Volumes *Book I deals with al-Haytham's theories on light, colors, and vision. *Book II is where al-Haytham presents his theory of visual perception. *Book III and Book VI present al-Haytham's ideas on the errors in visual perception with Book VI focusing on errors related to reflection. *Book IV and Book V provide experimental evidence for al-Haytham's theories on reflection. *Book VII deals with the concept of refraction. Influence The Book of Optics was most strongly influenced by Ptolemy's Optics, while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based upon an account by Galen. The Book of Optics was translated into Latin by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th (or the beginning of the 13th) century. The work was influential during the Middle Ages.David Lindberg, Mark Smith and Nader El-Bizri note Alhazen's considerable influence on the Perspectivists: *Smith, A.

A budding poet, he wrote under the nom de plume of \\"Premi\\". Although belonging to the Digambara sect of Jainism, he adopted a non-sectarian attitude and published and translated many Digambara as well as ≈övetƒÅmbara works. Working as a clerk in a firm in Mumbai he rose to establish his own publishing house and bookstore Hindi Granth RatnƒÅkar KƒÅryƒÅlay which published works of many of the biggest names in Indian literature, including Munshi Premchand, Hajariprasad Dvivedi, Jainendrakumar, Yashpal, Swami Satyabhakta, Sharatchandra Chatterjee and Rabindranath Tagore. The bookshop and publishing house now called Hindi Granth Karyalay is now being managed by his grandson and great-grandson 100 years after its establishment. Early life Born on 26 November 1881 in Deori, in the district of Sagar in Bundelkhand, Madhya Pradesh, NƒÅth≈´rƒÅm Premƒ´ was the eldest child of Tundelal Modi, a travelling merchant of modest means, belonging to the ParavƒÅra community of Digambara Jains hailing from Bundelkhand. He studied in grammar school and was the monitor of his class. He cleared his pre-high school exams in 1898 and became a schoolteacher nearby at Rehli. In the late 1890s, he married Rama Devi, who was from the nearby village of Sarkheda, in the district of Sagar. Career in Hindi and Jain literature Premiji's family in 1913 CE: Premiji along with his young son, Hemchandra and wife, Ramadevi NƒÅth≈´rƒÅm Premƒ´ excelled in the field of literature as a poet, editor, writer and publisher earning respect and affection of his contemporaries like Munshi Premchand, Mahaviraprasad Dwivedi, Rahul Sankrityayan, Pandit Sukhlalji, Muni Jinavijayaji, Ganeshprasadji Varni, Pandit Becharadasji Doshi, Pandit Agarchand Nahata and Dr Dalsukh Malvania.Pandit Sukhlalji, Muni Jinavijayaji, Pandit Becharadasji Doshi, Pandit Agarchand Nahata and Dr Dalsukh Malvania acknowledged their debt to Premiji in a festschrift dedicated to him Section l, \\"Abhinandana\\", Premƒ´ Abhinandana Grantha, Pages 1- 62. Premiji and Munshi Premchand were close friends, and he published the first edition of Munshi Premchand's classic novel, GodƒÅn. He also published Premchand's short story collections entitled Nava Nidhi and Sapta Saroj. =A budding poet = Under the inspiration of his guru Syed Amir Ali Mir, Nathuram became a budding poet, writing in Urdu and Braj under the nom de plume of \\"Premi\\". Since then he was affectionately called Premiji by his friends and contemporaries. His poems were published in the literary magazines of the time, Rasika Mitra, Rasika VƒÅtikƒÅ and KƒÅvya SudhƒÅkara. =Editor and writer= =Establishment of Hindi Granth Karyalay= Hindi Granth Karyalay at Hirabaug, C.P. Tank, Mumbai founded by Pandit Nathuram Premi in 1912 On 24 September 1912 Premiji founded the publishing house Hindi Granth RatnƒÅkar KƒÅryƒÅlay (now known as Hindi Granth Karyalay) at C.P. Tank, Mumbai. It was to become the foremost Hindi publishing house in India and is also the oldest bookstore of Mumbai. The first publication was a Hindi translation of John Stuart Mill's On Liberty, titled SvƒÅdhƒ´natƒÅ translated by Mahavira Prasad Dvivedi. He published almost the entire oeuvre of Sharat Chandra Chatterji, the Bengali writer, and some works of Rabindranath Tagore, such as ƒÄnkh kƒ´ Kirkirƒ´, and NaukƒÅ D≈´bƒ´. Premiji also published Hindi translations of the Gujarati writer KM Munshi, such as GujarƒÅt ke NƒÅth and PƒÅtan kƒÅ Prabhutva. Other famous works published include Munshi Premchand's classic novel, GodƒÅn and short story collections titled Nava Nidhi and Sapta Saroj. He also published works of then new writers such as Hajariprasad Dvivedi, Jainendrakumar, Yashpal, Acharya Chatursen, and Pandit Sudarshan. He also published the Bengali plays of Dvijendra Lal Rai for the first time in Hindi. In memory of Seth Manikchandra, Premiji established the Manikacandra Jain GranthamƒÅlƒÅ wherein he published Jain scriptures, for the first time systematically edited by philologists. The Manikacandra Jain GranthamƒÅlƒÅ published over 48 Digambara Jain texts, mostly written in Prakrit, Apabhram≈õa or Sanskrit. He ran the Manikacandra Jain GranthamƒÅlƒÅ on an honorary basis between 1915 and the 1950s selling all the books at cost price. When his health began to fail, it was decided to hand over the series to BhƒÅratƒ´ya J√±ƒÅnapƒ´tha in Varanasi.Unfortunately after that, the series came to a halt and none of its books are available today. =A non-sectarian Jain scholar= Premiji was non-sectarian in his attitude and shared a good rapport with many Svetambara scholars. Besides many Digambara scriptures, he published and translated many ≈övetƒÅmbara scriptures. He once remarked to Sukhlalji that he wished that the learned Digambara scholars would give up their sectarian views.Jain Study Circular (January‚ÄìApril 2006 Issue) During those times there used to be heated debate whether Acarya UmƒÅsvƒÅti (UmƒÅsvƒÅmƒ´) belonged to the ≈övetƒÅmbara or the Digambara tradition. Premiji, although a Digambara himself, went against views of Digambara community and opined that he was neither, but belonged to the YƒÅpanƒ´ya tradition.Premƒ´, NƒÅth≈´rƒÅm (1956) Pt. Sukhlal Sanghvi, a ≈övetƒÅmbara Jain scholar observed Premiji's non-sectarian attitude: :\\"He was considered to be a Pandit ‚Äì a scholar of Jain tradition. To me it was a surprise! How could his writings be so impartial and audacious? I had come in contact with many Jain friends and scholars, but until then, excepting a few, I had not come across any scholar who was as non-sectarian or fearless as Premiji. So I had developed the perception that it was impossible to find a Jain scholar who was non-sectarian as well as fearless. Premiji's writings gradually made me realise that I had the wrong notion. This was the foremost reason for me to be attracted towards him. :[...] :We had an excellent understanding of traditions of one another but we had no sectarian complicities.\\" =Contribution to other Indian languages= =Social reformer= Premiji in 1946 Premiji's legacy Under his tutelage, Hindi Granth RatnƒÅkar KƒÅryƒÅlay became India's No. 1 publishers of Hindi literature. In recognition of his contributions to Indian literature, the acclaimed Hindi novelist Vishnu Prabhakar called Premiji the \\"Bhƒ´sma PitƒÅmaha\\" of Hindi publishing. Front and back cover of TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra by PrabhƒÅcandra ‚Äì Volume 7 of Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series (2008) Premiji had suffered from asthma for a long time and died owing to old age on 30 January 1960. He left behind his daughter-in-law and two grandsons, Yashodhar Modi and Vidyadhar Modi. They are continuing his legacy along with their children. In Premiji's memory, his grandson Yashodhar Modi has started the Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series. This series has published select volumes focusing on subjects as varied as Jainism, philosophy and yoga and published original texts by ancient and medieval Jain ascetics such as Kundakunda, Samantabhadra, P≈´jyapƒÅda, Joindu, PrabhƒÅcandra, VƒÅdirƒÅja, BhƒÅvadeva and many others, usually accompanied by translation in either Hindi or English. Also, modern scholars such as Premiji himself, Prof. Ludwig Alsdorf, Prof. Maurice Bloomfield, Prof. Willem Boll√©e and Dr. Jaykumar Jalaj have been and are being published in the Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series.

As well as a huge variety of flora, the Andes contain many different animal species. With almost 1,000 species, of which roughly 2/3 are endemic to the region, the Andes are the most important region in the world for amphibians.Tropical Andes - biodiversityhotspots.org The diversity of animals in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of mammals (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (about 1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of reptiles (about 45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (about 1/3 endemic). Mammals The Andean cat is rarely seen and generally not well-known The spectacled bear is the only South American bear The vicu√±a and guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated llama and alpaca are widely kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool. Cougars are also found in the region and play an important role in many Andean cultures together with the llama. The nocturnal chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, inhabits the Andes' alpine regions, but are well-known in captivity.Eisenberg, J.F.; & Redford, K.H. (2000). Mammals of the Neotropics, Volume 3: The Central Neotropics: Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil. Eisenberg, J.F.; & Redford, K.H. (1992). Mammals of the Neotropics, Volume 2: The Southern Cone: Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay. Another domestic that originates from the Andean region is the guinea pig. Other wild mammals found in the relatively open habitats of the high Andes include the huemul deer and foxes in the genus Pseudalopex. Although very rich in flora and fauna, few large mammals are found in the Andean cloud forests, including the Yungas and parts of the Choc√≥, exceptions being the threatened mountain tapir, spectacled bear and yellow-tailed woolly monkey. Birds Adult male Andean condor, the largest flying land-bird of the Americas Colourful tanagers (here hooded mountain tanager) are common in Andean forests The Andean condor, the largest flying land-bird in the Western Hemisphere, occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities.Fjeldsaa, J.; & Krabbe, N. (1990). Birds of the High Andes: A Manual to the Birds of the Temperate Zone of the Andes and Patagonia, South America. Numerous other birds are found in open habitats of the Andes, including certain species of tinamous (notably members of the genus Nothoprocta), Andean goose, torrent duck, giant coot, flamingos, lesser rhea, Andean flicker, diademed sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches. A few species of hummingbirds, notably some hillstars, can be seen at altitudes above , but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests (\\"cloud forests\\") growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. Other birds of humid Andean forests include mountain-toucans, quetzals and the Andean cock-of-the-rock, while mixed species flocks dominated by tanagers and furnariids commonly are seen ‚Äì in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens, tapaculos and antpittas. A number of species such as the royal cinclodes and white-browed tit-spinetail are associated with Polylepis woods, and consequently also threatened. Aquatic animals Telmatobius is restricted to the Andes and include many threatened species (pictured: T. marmoratus)Victoriano, Mu√±oz-Mendoza, S√°ez, Salinas, Mu√±oz- Ram√≠rez, Sallaberry, Fibla and M√©ndez (2015).

Taxonomy The French naturalist Philibert Commerson provided the first description of this fish from R√©union in the western Indian Ocean, but it was not published in a format allowing full citation. Therefore, the species name and description by Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de (who acknowledged Commerson) takes precedence, albeit with a nod to Commerson.Lac√©p√®de, B. G. E. (1802) Histoire naturelle des poissons. v. 4, p.273 With no original or subsequent illustrations or specimens denoted as types, Fricke nominated a neotype in 1999 but subsequently withdrew it.Fricke, R. (2000) Invalid neotypes Copeia 2000 (no. 2): 639-640 = Etymology = This species has on occasion been mistakenly considered a junior synonym of the similar species Ostorhinchus fleurieu, but is generally acknowledged as separate; it had the junior species synonym roseipinnis applied by Georges Cuvier in 1829.Eschmeyer, W.

Description This fish is coppery-coloured with a broad blackish bar at the base of the tail, up to 14.5 cm in length. The upper jaw has a narrow blue streak, and a broad blackish stripe extends from the front of the snout to the eye. Easily confused with Ostorhinchus fleurieu,Lieske, E. and Myers, R.F. (2004) Coral reef guide; Red Sea London, HarperCollins where the black tail bar does not narrow in the centre, but unlike this species, the stripe is also present in juveniles. Internally, O. aureus is one of a large group of nocturnal feeding fishes which has a black pigmented gut lining, apparently to hide the glow of bioluminescent prey from its own piscivores in turn. The eyes of O. aureus allow the transmission of ultraviolet light, which if it is proven to be able to see, could benefit its nocturnal foraging. = Meristics = Using a shorthand meristics formula, O. aureus can be described as having: D, VII-I,9 A, II,8 P, 14 LL, 25 GR, 6-8 + 16-20Allen, G.R. and M.V. Erdmann 2012 Reef fishes of the East Indies. Tropical Reef Research, Perth, Australia. Volume I, p. 387. Habitat Ostorhinchus aureus inhabits holes in rocks or under ledges in shallow waters. It is known to occur in mixed aggregates with Ostorhinchus apogonoides during summer and autumn, but form separate aggregates in winter and spring. =Settlement= Whereas coral reef fish settlement tends to be dominated by larval recruitment, in at least part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, recruitment of O. aureus at any given coral reef patch tends to be by adult and juvenile migration across intervening sand and coral debris. =Parasites= O. aureus is subject to infection by tiny cnidarian parasites from class Myxosporea. Fish specimens have been found with gall bladder infections of Ceratomyxa apogoni, Ceratomyxa cardinalis, and Ellipsomyxa apogoni,. Three species have also been found in skeletal muscle cells: Kudoa cheilodipteri, Kudoa whippsi, and Kudoa iwatai. Behaviour O.aureus is a nocturnal predator; where seagrass is adjacent to its reef, it tends to venture out further than some other members of its family. =Diet= Studies of stomach contents show that O.aureus is a generalist predator, eating mainly planktonic and benthic crustaceans, but, unusually for its family, may at times also eat marine algae. =Reproduction= Adults tend to pair whilst juveniles tend to aggregate during the day time. Importance to humans =Aquariums= O. aureus is regularly kept by marine aquarists.Ring- tailed cardinalfish - Apogon aureus AquaticCommunity.com References External links * aureus Category:Fish of the Red Sea Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean Category:Fish described in 1802 ","title":"Ring-tailed cardinalfish"},{"id":"11828885","text":"Insights is a public affairs television program based in Dallas, Texas.

Setting Earth No More opens in a small New England town quarantined due to a mysterious outbreak. Poisonous red vines have been spreading quickly (similar to the red weed in The War of the Worlds) simultaneously strangling and terra-forming the environment. The main character is at the town with the four other characters that he will team up with. Development Earth No More was scheduled to be released in 2009 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles by the Finnish developer Recoil Games. The release was postponed indefinitely in 2009 due to 3D Realms' financial reasons and their layoffs, and in February 2011 Recoil Games told the Finnish financial newspaper Kauppalehti that they are no longer involved in the project. In the Radar Group website, the developer of the game is listed as \\"unannounced\\". In June 2012 Earth No More appeared on several websites including Gambitious, Symbid and Impact Crowd all of which are websites dedicated to projects being invested in by people in the game industry. Labeled as Earth No More - 3D Realms with the description Mankind's relentless destruction of Earth awakens a biological response from deep within the planet's crust that threatens an environmental apocalypse. This signaled the rumored revival of Earth No More under 3D Realms' helm with rumors circulating the internet about a Summer 2012 announcement of the title. Still, nothing was ever released. =Controversy= In February 2008 Edge reported that 3D Realms was being sued by Cinemagraphix Entertainment for stealing the idea of the Earth No More video game. Cinemagraphix claimed that they had pitched the idea in 2005 to various game developers including 3D Realms. Cinemagraphix complaints accuse the defendants (3D Realms), of copyright infringement, unlawful competition, misappropriation, unfair business practices, unjust enrichment, conspiracy and other claims. They said that 3D Realms had not just stolen the name but the premise and concept art as well, stating that their concept and the in- development shooter are \\"virtually identical in substance\\".

At this time Petersen was largely influenced by thrash metal bands and has stated in interviews that this style of music formed the foundation for his tight guitar playing. He was entirely self-taught, having learned guitar by playing to his favorite bands and learning music theory over the internet.http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/showinterview.php?id=1389‚ü®=en Lord of Metal By 16 he had joined his first band in Omaha, NE called Roy Batty, a post hardcore band, as their 2nd guitarist. The band played several shows in the midwest but disbanded shortly after. The next 2 years he spent jamming and rehearsing with various bands in the Omaha area but quickly became discouraged by the Omaha music scene's lack of traditional metal. In 2002 Petersen began posting musician's wanted ads for band members who wished to form a European influenced metal band. It was quickly responded to by bassist Josh Krohn.

A video floppy, also known as a VF disk, could store up to 25 frames either in the NTSC or PAL video standards, with each frame containing 2 fields of interlaced video. The video floppy also could store 50 frames of video, with each frame of video only containing one field of video information, recorded or played back in a \\"skip-field\\" fashion. Video floppies were first developed by Sony and introduced under the \\"Mavipak\\" name in 1981 for their Mavica still video camera (not to be confused with their later line of Mavica digital cameras introduced in the mid-1990s, which stored JPEG images to standard 3.5-inch floppy disks readable by computers instead). The video floppy format was later used by Minolta, Panasonic, and Canon for their still video cameras introduced in the mid-to-late 1980s, such as the Canon Xapshot from 1988 (also known as the Canon Ion in Europe and the Canon Q-PIC in Japan). Besides still video cameras, stand-alone recorders & players were also available for the VF format, that could record from or output a composite video signal, to or from an external source (such as a video camera, VCR, video capture card, or computer graphics output). Some VF recorders also had the feature of recording a couple of seconds of audio that accompanied each video frame. Uses of the Video Floppy The video floppy saw a lot of uses during its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, besides being used for still video cameras. Many medical endoscopy and dentistry video systems, as well as industrial video borescopes & fiberscopes, used VF disks for storing video images for later playback and study. Standalone VF recorders & players were also used by television stations and video production studios as a still-store system for stills & graphics for use in a television production, or for on-air slides used for station identification or during technical difficulties (such as a \\"Please Stand By\\" still). A similar sized disk was also used by the Zenith Minisport laptop computer from 1989, digitally formatted for data storage. The Minisport could store up to 793 KB of information on 2-inch LT format disks called LT-1. Video floppy and LT-1 are not compatible, so media can not be interchanged between drives using video floppy or LT standards. An enhanced version of the VF format called Hi-VF was introduced in the late 1980s, providing higher resolution per video still than its predecessor. It used higher-bandwidth video recording, much like S-VHS as compared to VHS, or Hi8 compared to Video 8.

It had more success with its DH class shunter with over 130 built for Queensland Rail, the New South Wales Government Railways, Emu Bay Railway and Western Australian Government Railways. =Steam locomotives= *46 Queensland B class *122 Queensland PB15 class *45 Queensland C16 class *138 Queensland C17 class *6 Queensland C19 class *83 Queensland B18¬º class *25 Queensland BB18¬º class *20 Victorian DD class *20 Commonwealth Railways KA class *8 Commonwealth Railways C class *40 South Australian T class *3 Tasmanian Government Railways Q class Diesel electric locomotives *12 Queensland 1170 class Diesel hydraulic locomotives *6 BHP Whyalla DH class *3 Emu Bay Railway 10 class *73 Queensland Railways DH class *50 New South Wales 73 class *7 Emu Bay Railway 11 class *5 Western Australian Government Railways M class Electric locomotives *50 Queensland Rail 3500/3600 class *30 Queensland Rail 3900 class Electric multiple units A former Kuala Lumpur Metro rolling stock of Adtranz-Walkers EMU *264 Queensland Rail EMU carriages *36 Queensland Rail SMU200 carriages *90 Queensland Rail SMU220 carriages *20 Queensland Rail ICE carriages *30 Queensland Rail IMU100 carriages *12 Queensland Rail IMU120 carriages *96 Transperth A series carriages *90 Kuala Lumpur Metro Line 3 & 4 light rail vehicles\\"EDI Wins Light Rail Order Extension\\" Railway Digest June 1995 page 9 Tilt Trains *12 Queensland Rail Tilt Train carriages  Awards  In 2017, Walkers Limited was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame.

It‚Äôs a big call because there are many great tracks on that album, but it is this song that speaks to me the most... all the instruments are set to a relaxed and comfortable tempo that is in no way intrusive, including a solo with a similar sound to those of Led Zepplin and Eric Clapton.\\" Olivier for Sleaze Roxx in his review of the studio album felt \\"Songs such as 'Rockin' Rocks', 'Stumblin' and of course '(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind' have an infectious groove to them and are excellent straight-on rockers with an old school '70s feel... after the seventh song 'Stumblin', you might as well just shut off the CD and call it a day.\\" Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald compared the track to \\"what the Stooges' Ron Ashton might have sounded like if he had played with the Rolling Stones.\\" Track listing # \\"Stumblin'\\" (Live from Sydney Entertainment Centre, 12 December 2003) # \\"Stumblin'\\" (Studio version) Notes External links * Category:2004 singles Category:Powderfinger songs Category:2003 songs Category:Universal Music Group singles Category:Songs written by Jon Coghill Category:Songs written by John Collins (Australian musician) Category:Songs written by Bernard Fanning Category:Songs written by Ian Haug Category:Songs written by Darren Middleton ","title":"Stumblin'"},{"id":"11829135","text":"James Wang may refer to: *James C.

Opened in 1903, it became a leading theatrical venue before also serving in later years as a network radio and television studio, a night club, a movie theater, and a corporate event space. The Hudson Theatre reopened as a Broadway theater on February 11, 2017. The UK-based Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) signed a long-term lease on the theater in 2015 and invested in a complete refurbishment of the venue, bringing it back into full- time use as a Broadway playhouse. The theater is owned by Millennium & Copthorne Hotels. In 2016, the Hudson Theatre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The architectural firm of J. B. McElfatrick & Son made initial drawings for the Hudson Theatre in 1902, but the firm of Israels & Harder took the project over by 1903. When the Hudson opened, on October 19 of that year with Ethel Barrymore starring in Cousin Kate, it had a number of distinctive architectural features, including an unusually large foyer, a triple-domed ceiling, and a system of diffused lighting.\\"The New Hudson Theatre\\". The New York Times. October 18, 1903.\\"Miss Ethel Barrymore in Cousin Kate\\". The New York Times. October 20, 1903.\\"The Hudson Theatre\\". Architects' and Builders' Magazine. Vol. 36 No. 5 (February 1904). p. 200. Online at HathiTrust. Built by theatrical producer Henry B. Harris, the theatre was later managed by his wife Renee Harris following his death on the RMS Titanic. From the 1930s through the 1940s, the theater often served as a CBS Radio studio in between theatrical engagements. In 1950, NBC purchased the theater and converted it for permanent use as a television studio. Broadway Open House, The Kate Smith Hour, and the first season of The Price Is Right were among the shows that originated there. In 1954, the Hudson became home to The Tonight Show which remained there, first with host Steve Allen and later Jack Paar, until 1959. Developer Abraham Hirschfeld purchased the structure in 1956, and returned it to use as a legitimate theater from 1960 to 1968. It became a movie house for adult films in 1974. Then in 1980, it became the Savoy rock club. In 1987, the building was granted landmark status by the City of New York. When owner Henry Macklowe developed the surrounding lots into a new luxury hotel, the Macklowe Hotel, he incorporated the landmarked theater, using it as a conference center and auditorium. Millennium & Copthorne Hotels bought the hotel and the Hudson in 1995, renaming the hotel the Millennium Broadway. During its time as a conference center for the hotel, it was also the site of stand-up comedy shows which were taped for broadcast on the Comedy Central cable network. In 2015, it was announced that the British-based Ambassador Theatre Group would assume management of the Hudson from the hotel and convert it back into a legitimate Broadway theater. Upon reopening in 2017, the Hudson became the 41st theater operating on Broadway and also the oldest, having originally opened slightly earlier in 1903 than the Lyceum and New Amsterdam Theatres.Viagas, Robert. \\"Hudson Theatre Will Be Reopened as Broadway House\\", Playbill, December 16, 2015.

The ship was laid down by Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd in early 1941, launched later that year, and commissioned in 1942. After a short assignment to Fremantle as an anti- submarine patrol ship, Gawler was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet as a convoy escort. In April 1943, she was sent to the Mediterranean for minesweeping duties. The corvette participated in the Allied invasion of Sicily, rescued survivors from the torpedoed troopship , and on one occasion escorted a convoy in the Atlantic. In October, Gawler rejoined the Eastern Fleet and resumed Indian Ocean convoy escort duties. After a refit at the start of 1945, Gawler joined the British Pacific Fleet. At the war's end, the corvette was tasked with mine-clearing and anti=piracy operations around Hong Kong, then sent to the Molucca Islands to inspect former Japanese facilities. Gawler was decommissioned from the RAN in April 1946. The Admiralty transferred the ship to the Turkish Navy, where she was recommissioned as TCG Ayvalik. The corvette remained in Turkish service until 1963. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including Gawler) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Gawler was laid down by the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd Shipyard at Whyalla, South Australia on 24 January 1941. She was launched on 4 October 1941 by the wife of Sir Winston Dugan, then Governor of Victoria, and commissioned into the RAN on 14 August 1942. The ship was originally to be named Gambier, for the city of Mount Gambier, South Australia. Operational history =RAN service= Upon entering service in September 1942, Gawler was briefly based at Fremantle, Western Australia as an anti-submarine patrol vessel before being assigned to the British Eastern Fleet and ordered to sail to Colombo. The corvette served in the Indian Ocean as a convoy escort between January and April 1943. Following this, Gawler and three sister ships were formed into as the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla and sent to the Mediterranean to serve as minesweepers and convoy escorts. On 17 June 1943 when the British troopship was sunk off the coast of Libya, Gawler and her sister ship were among the ships that rescued 1,477 survivors. In July, Gawler was involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily, and in August the corvette sailed into the Atlantic to meet a Mediterranean-bound convoy. Gawler rejoined the Eastern Fleet in October 1943, and resumed escort duties until January 1945, with the exception of a refit in Durban during January and February 1944. After leaving the Eastern Fleet, Gawler underwent a four-month refit in Adelaide, before joining the British Pacific Fleet at Manus Island in April 1945. She remained with the Pacific Fleet until after the end of World War II; operating in Hong Kong waters during September with mine-warfare and anti-piracy duties, before sailing to the Molucca Islands and spending the rest of 1945 providing surveillance of former Japanese positions in the area. Gawler returned to Australian waters in February 1946, and was decommissioned in Sydney on 5 April 1946. The corvette received three battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1942\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1942‚Äì45\\", and \\"Sicily 1943\\". =Turkish Navy service= Prior to decommissioning, Gawler was marked for transfer to the Turkish Navy. Upon decommissioning, Gawler was immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Gawler. On 21 May 1946, Gawler, with sister ships and , sailed for Colombo, where they were decommissioned from the Royal Navy and commissioned into the Turkish Navy. Gawler was renamed TCG Ayvalik. The corvette was withdrawn from service in 1963. The name was passed on to sister corvette TCG Antalya (the former ).

Many of the trails up the mountain are unmarked which adds to the difficulty of reaching the summit. Mount Woolsey is an adjacent summit only to the southeast.

constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Geelong was lost after a collision on 18 October 1944. She was one of only three Bathurst class corvettes lost during World War II. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Geelong) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Geelong was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria on 16 October 1940. She was launched on 22 April 1941 by the wife of Lord Winston Dugan, then Governor of Victoria, and was commissioned into the RAN on 16 January 1942. Operational history After commissioning, Geelong visited her namesake city before undergoing working up trials. On completion, the corvette was assigned as a minesweeper and anti-submarine patrol ship along the east coast of Australia, before being redeployed to New Caledonia on 8 March 1942 to perform similar duties. In May 1942, Geelong returned Sydney, and was one of several Allied vessels located in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack of 31 May 1942. In June, the ship began convoy escort runs between Sydney and Brisbane, which continued until January 1944, when she sailed to Adelaide for a two-month refit. After the refit, Geelong briefly operated in Australian waters before being assigned to New Guinea. Using Milne Bay as a base of operations, the corvette served as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship throughout the South West Pacific Area. Fate On 18 October 1944, Geelong collided with the American tanker York and sank north of Langemak, New Guinea, at . No lives were lost, with the survivors picked up by York and transported to Langemak. Geelong was one of only three Bathurst class ships to be lost during World War II, and one of two lost to collision. The ship received two battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì44\\" and \\"New Guinea 1944\\".

She is Algerian with Berber origins.  Biography  Considered one of the most promising singers of her generation, Amel Brahim-Djelloul started her musical studies with the violin. She began studying singing in 1995 in Algiers under the tuition of Abdelhamid Belferouni. It was Noelle Barker who advised her to go to Paris to finish her training, and she studied at the Ecole Nationale de Musique at Montreuil with Frantz Petri and then at the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique in Paris with Peggy Bouveret and Malcolm Walker, with whom she has since been working. She graduated from the Conservatoire in June 2003. Amel Brahim-Djelloul began very early to tackle the key roles in her repertoire. In 2002 she sang Dido in Purcell's opera under Stephen Stubb, and went on to make her debut in the role of Pamina with the Orchestre National d'Ile de France with Alain Altinoglu conducting. Ren√© Jacobs noticed her and invited her to take part in a new production of Sartorio's Giulio Cesare at the Innsbruck Ancient Music Festival, conducted by Attilio Cremonesi. He then gave her the roles of Valletto and Amore in a new production of The Coronation of Poppea which he conducted at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es, then at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, and at the Op√©ra de la Monnaie in Brussels in a production by David McVicar. Amel Brahim-Djelloul later took part in William Christie's Jardin des Voix with whom she appeared on the most renowned stages in the world including the Cit√© de la Musique in Paris, the Barbican in London, the Grand Th√©√¢tre of Geneva, the Grand Auditorium in Madrid, and the Lincoln Center in New York. Having attracted attention during this tour, she was then invited to sing in Handel's Messiah with the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington. She made her debut at the Festival International d'Art Lyrique at Aix-en-Provence in July 2005 in the role of Servilia in a new production of La clemenza di Tito. Her career has since been involved with such roles as Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro at the opera of Angers-Nantes and then Lausanne, Despina in Cos√¨ fan tutte at Nice, Adina in L'elisir d'amore at Avignon and the title role in Messager's V√©ronique at the Paris Ch√¢telet. She has also been heard in The Coronation of Poppea at the Grand Th√©√¢tre of Geneva and in the new production of Pell√©as et M√©lisande, conducted by Bernard Haitink at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es. Particularly admired for the quality of her voice and its opulent, sunlit timbre, Amel Brahim-Djelloul appears regularly in recitals with Claude Lavoix, Anne le Bozec and Anne- C√©line Barr√®re, for instance in April 2006 at Lille Opera and in June 2006 at the Saint-Denis Festival.

Subsequently, he was arrested by the forces of President Ngo Dinh Diem and not allowed to take his seat. The most prominent dissident during the rule of Diem, he is remembered more for his incarceration than his activities after Diem's fall, when he became a cabinet minister.  Early years  Phan Quang ƒê√°n hailed from the north central province of Xiangkhouang Province in Laos. He studied for a period in a seminary, and was an American trained OSS (now CIA) agent during the Second World War.Fall, p. 259. He studied medicine in Hanoi when he entered politics in 1945 following the collapse of the Japanese occupation. This ushered in a period of political ferment as Ho Chi Minh and his Viet Minh proclaimed the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and battled French Union forces who attempted to regain control of the country. He briefly joined the Vietnamese People's Party and the Great Vietnam Civil Servants Party before forming a newspaper based group named \\"Thi·∫øt Th·ª±c\\". According to his account, he twice turned down Vietminh offers of a cabinet position in 1946 to follow Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i to China and Hong Kong. There during 1947 and 1948, he was an advisor as B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i attempted to negotiate a return to Vietnam with the French. When a Provisional Central Government was established in 1948 with B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's blessing, Dan joined it as Minister of Information. He resigned after several months, citing the French reluctance to grant the government any powers to facilitate Vietnamese autonomy, noting that they wanted to ‚Äòreestablish the old colonial regime‚Äô. During this period working for Bao Dai, Dan worked closely with Nghi√™m Xu√¢n Thi·ªán. The pair were both members of the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang and later worked on the Thoi Luan newspaper together. In 1949, Dan formed his own group, the Republican Party (Cong Hoa Dang) and went abroad to study for his PhD at the Harvard School of Public Health while continuing his political activities. In 1951, he published his political treatise Volont√© Vietnamienne, articulating his vision for an independent non-Communist Vietnam. This included multiparty democratic elections. His political activities spread to his academic work; his thesis Vietnam‚Äôs Health: Present Conditions and Proposals of Reorganization, had references to Vietnam‚Äôs political future.Picard, p. 7. According to Cao Van Luan, a Catholic priest who served in academic posts under Diem‚Äôs regime and was a former seminary colleague of Dan, Diem and Dan were in contact while the pair were in political exile in the US in the 1950s. Luan was of the opinion that Diem, who was appointed Prime Minister by Bao Dai in 1954, assumed that Dan was receptive to him as a politician. In August 1955, one month before returning to Vietnam, Dan published a Vietnamese translation of Volont√© Vietnamienne.Picard, p. 8. The reason for Dan's exclusion from further B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i and then Ngo Dinh Diem cabinets is disputed. Dan said that it was due to Diem being appointed by B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, but the government maintained that it was because he was holding out for a more important ministry,Scigliano, pp. 82-83. having allegedly rejected an offer to become the Minister for Social Welfare. For his part, Dan later claimed that he rebuffed Diem because he ‚Äònever intended to cooperate with Di·ªám‚Äô, who he asserted could not administer a government that could modernise Vietnam in a democratic manner, but instead was set on feudal and nepotistic rule. Dan claimed that upon his return to Vietnam in September 1955, Diem‚Äôs officials sought him out at the airport to arrange a meeting at the Norodom Palace. Dan claimed that he reprimanded Diem for running a nepotistic regime and relying on the counsel of his younger brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, and stated his intention to contribute to South Vietnamese politics by organising ‚Äòa constructive, legal opposition‚Äô. According to the historian Jason Picard, Diem viewed Dan‚Äôs publications and remarks as disrespectful and a challenge to his political authority.Picard, p. 9.  Diem era career  In October, Diem proclaimed himself the President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam after defeating Bao Dai in a fraudulent referendum and from then on, Dan was the centre of much of the open opposition to Diem's regime. First he headed a coalition of opposition groups which fought the government's arrangements for the 1956 election of a Constituent Assembly. The coalition had three component groups with government approval: The National Restoration League, the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. Three months after the elections for the Constituent Assembly, the coalition collapsed when the leaders of the first two parties were jailed and the third party threatened into dissolution. Dan was briefly arrested on the eve of the 1956 elections, and accused by government controlled media of involvement in communist and colonialist activities. He had penned a letter to Diem in which he accused the regime of using dictatorial methods. He was then sacked under secret government orders from his position at The University of Saigon Faculty of Medicine, and blacklisted from holding academic positions at universities and placed under continuous police surveillance. Undeterred, he continued his political activities and in May 1957 formed another opposition coalition called the Democratic Opposition Bloc (Kh·ªëi D√¢n Ch·ªß ƒê·ªëi L·∫≠p).Picard, p. 1. At its launch, he stated ‚ÄòTwo fundamental weaknesses facing the southern regime today are the total absence of an independent press and an opposition camp both recognized and tolerated by the ruling authority‚Äô, and stated that they would for the promotion of democratic processes in South Vietnam. The group had their own newspaper, the Th·ªùi Lu·∫≠n, which was revamped to coincide with the launch of the new party.Picard, p. 2. These announcements were timed to coincide with Diem‚Äôs Diem‚Äôs state visit to the US, provoking an angry reaction in private from the president. Over the next year until its shutdown, Th·ªùi Lu·∫≠n became the most popular newspaper in the country, averaging around 100,000 copies per issue, which was quadruple the circulation of rival newspapers. It sold in the capital Saigon and was distributed through the black market across the country, trumpeting itself as the outlet of those who could not speak. It stated its purpose as: The newspaper generated attention for its open and combative criticism of Diem‚Äôs regime. Its office was ransacked by a government organised mob in September 1957, and was closed down in March 1958 by a court order. Dan withdrew from the Democratic Bloc in April 1958 and the group collapsed as Dan sought to set up the Free Democratic Party and permission to publish a newspaper. Neither applications were approved, and various members of Dan's party were arrested for their political activities. In 1959, two newspapers were shut down after they published Dan's articles.Scigliano, p. 83. Dan openly criticized the main platform of American economic development aid to South Vietnam, the Commercial Import Program. This allowed licensed importers to buy US dollars at rates far lower than the official exchange rate, and then buy American goods with it. Instead of importing capital goods to fuel industrialization, the money was mostly spent on consumer goods to create an urban upper-class loyal to the government.Kahin, pp. 85-88. Dan said \\"The U.S. Commercial Import Program-- which costs us nothing--brings in on a massive scale luxury goods of all kinds, which give us an artificial society--enhanced material conditions that don't amount to anything, and no sacrifice; it brings luxury to our ruling group and middle class, and luxury means corruption.\\"Kahin, p. 87. = Election and disbarring = In August 1959, Dan ran for the National Assembly in a constituency in Saigon and was elected by a 6-1 ratio over Diem's government candidate. This came despite 8000 Army of the Republic of Vietnam soldiers being bussed from out of district to stuff ballot boxes to support the government candidate. He was regarded as a nationalist anti-communist who was one of the most able political figures in the country.Warner, pp. 112-114. Despite strong protests from the US and UK embassies, Diem was adamant that Dan would not be able to take his seat. When the Assembly was inaugurated, Dan was confronted by police and put under arrest as he attempted to leave his medical clinic to attend the session. Dan was charged with electoral fraud, on the grounds that he supposedly offered free medical care to induce voters to support him. He also pointed out that if this were the case, then he would have run for election in the district in which his practice was located, to maximise the number of patients who were in his voting district.Scigliano, p. 95. = Imprisonment = In November 1960, a coup attempt by ARVN paratroopers was launched against Diem. As the attempt unfolded, Dan agreed to become a spokesperson for the coup leaders. He cited political mismanagement of the war against the Vietcong and the government's refusal to broaden its political base as the reason for the revolt.Jacobs, p. 118. Dan spoke on Radio Vietnam and staged a media conference during which a rebel paratrooper pulled a portrait of the president from the wall, ripped it and stamped on it.Moyar, p. 114. However, the plot leaders stalled their coup when Diem falsely promised reform. Diem then crushed the rebels and Dan was arrested, tortured and sentenced to eight years of hard labour in the penal colony on Poulo Condore where the French had once imprisoned Vietnamese nationalists. Were it not for western protests, Diem would have had Dan executed. As a result of the successful coup in 1963 in which Diem was deposed and assassinated, Dan was released from prison. ƒê√°n was garlanded and taken to military headquarters.Blair, p. 81.  Later career  In 1966 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly and unsuccessfully contested the 1967 Presidential election. He then became foreign affairs minister and later the deputy Prime Minister for social welfare and refugees. His most prominent role was to resettle thousands of displaced war victims and refugees. When South Vietnam fell in 1975, Dan left for the United States.

Known for his portraiture and genre scenes, Anshutz was a co-founder of The Darby School. One of Thomas Eakins's most prominent students, he succeeded Eakins as director of drawing and painting classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Personal life and education Thomas Anshutz was born in Newport, Kentucky in 1851. He grew up in Newport and Wheeling, West Virginia. His early art instruction took place at the National Academy of Design in the early 1870s, where he studied under Lemuel Wilmarth. In 1875, he moved to Philadelphia and studied with Thomas Eakins at the Philadelphia Sketch Club, beginning a close association between the two. In 1892 Anshutz married Effie Shriver Russell. The two spent their honeymoon in Paris, where Anshutz attended classes at Acad√©mie Julian. In 1893 they returned to Philadelphia. Later in his life he proclaimed himself a socialist.Griffin, 2004, p. 150 He retired from teaching in the fall of 1911 due to poor health and died on June 16, 1912. Career =Association with Eakins and The Ironworkers' Noontime= A Rose, 1907; Metropolitan Museum of Art. Eakins began teaching at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1876, the same year that Anshutz enrolled as a student. Eakins was Chief Demonstrator of Anatomy and Christian Schussele was Professor of Drawing and Painting. In 1878 Anshutz became Eakins's assistant, eventually succeeding Eakins as Chief Demonstrator when Eakins was promoted to Professor of Drawing and Painting. In 1880, while still a student, Anshutz completed his first major work, The Ironworkers' Noontime. The Ironworkers' Noontime, Anshutz's most well known painting, depicts twenty-or-so workers on their break in the yard of a foundry. Painted near Wheeling, West Virginia, it is conceived in a naturalistic style similar to that of Eakins, although Eakins never painted industrial subjects.Griffin, 2004, p. 59 The piece was exhibited at the Philadelphia Sketch Club in 1881 and compared to Eakins's work by art critics. Art historian Randall C. Griffin has written of it: \\"One of the first American paintings to depict the bleakness of factory life, The Ironworkers' Noontime appears to be a clear indictment of industrialization. Its brutal candor startled critics, who saw it as unexpectedly confrontational‚Äîa chilling industrial snapshot not the least picturesque or sublime.\\"Griffin, 2004, p. 61 It is now in the collection of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Around 1880, Eakins became involved in photography, incorporating it into his classes and using it as a tool for his artwork. Anshutz and other students at the Academy started to make use of the camera, posing models and making prints for study. Anshutz participated in Eakins's The Naked Series, photographing nude models in seven pre-defined standing poses. He modeled for Eakins himself, along with colleagues such as J. Laurie Wallace and Covington Few Seiss, who would pose outdoors nude, often wrestling, swimming and boxing. Eadweard Muybridge eventually made his way to Philadelphia and Anshutz and Eakins helped build Muybridge's zoopraxiscope. =Loincloth incident= Eakins was forced to resign from the Academy in an 1886 scandal that was sparked by his use of a fully nude male model in front of either an all-female or a mixed- male-and-female class. Anshutz did not defend his mentor; he co-signed a letter to the Philadelphia Sketch Club: \\"We hereby charge Mr. Thoms Eakins with conduct unworthy of a gentleman & discreditable to this organization & ask his expulsion from the club.\\"Kathleen A. Foster and Cheryl Leibold, Writing About Eakins (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989), p. 220. =Maturity= Anshutz was promoted to Eakins's position at the Academy. Anshutz would briefly travel to Europe, focusing primarily on his teaching in Philadelphia. Numerous artists studied under Anshutz, including Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones, George Luks, Charles Demuth, John Sloan, Charles Sheeler, Everett Shinn, John Marin, William Glackens, Robert Henri and Margaret Taylor Fox. As a teacher, Anshutz, according to art historian Sanford Schwartz, \\"was known as much for his approachability as his sarcasm, which apparently wasn't of the withering variety.\\"Schwartz, 1982, p. 16 The Anshutz family regularly vacationed in Holly Beach, New Jersey which served as a creative place for the painter. There he experimented with watercolors, bright color palette, and simple compositions. He also photographed the natural environment, utilizing the images as studies for paintings, specifically Holly Beach and trips down the Delaware and Maurice rivers. Although Anshutz experimented persistently with landscape painting, he was more well known for his portraiture, which won him numerous awards in the 1890s and 1900s. In 1898 he and Hugh Breckenridge co-founded the Darby School, a summer school outside of Philadelphia which emphasized plein air painting. At Darby, Anshutz created his most abstract works, a series of bright oil landscape paintings that were never exhibited. He continued to participate in the Darby School until 1910. He was elected as an Associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1910. He served as president of the Philadelphia Sketch Club. =Legacy= In 1971 Robert and Joy McCarty, who lived in the home formerly owned by the Anshutz family in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, donated a portion of letters, glass negatives, and photographs to the Archives of American Art. A second donation from the Anshutz family took place in 1971 and 1972. The materials were microfilmed and returned to the family.

Born Huang Wenlai in 1892 in Huian County, Fukien Province, China. Due to his family's extreme poverty, he was sold to the Li family. The Li were not wealthy either and had a fruit growing business that allowed them to barely scrape together a living. His parents died in 1902 when he was only 11 years old. He realised how impermanent human life was and took refuge with Master Rui Fang of the famous Cheng Tian Chan Monastery. In 1927, he took ordination at the same monastery. From the very beginning, Guang Qin was an ascetic practitioner. In the monastery, one of his duties was to ring the morning wake-up bell. One morning, he accidentally over-slept and missed ringing the bell at the correct time. After that, he never lay down to sleep for the rest of his life and sat up in meditation during his sleep. In 1985 at the age of 92, on the first day of the Chinese New Year, he called together all of his disciples who were in charge of his different monasteries. He told them that he would pass away soon and that they should divide his relics among Cheng Tian Temple and other temples, monasteries and nunneries. He later went to Miao Tong Temple, the place where he would manifest stillness. On the fifth day of Chinese New Year, with all his disciples gathered around him he told them to recite Amitabha Buddha's name. He said, \\"There is no coming and no going, nothing is happening.\\" Then he smiled at his disciples and closed his eyes. He was so still that his disciples checked and discovered that he had died amidst the Amitabha chanting. Guang Qin died at the age of 93 in 1986. Photos that were taken by an anonymous disciple from Guang Qin's funeral displayed auspicious signs, such as lights pointing down at Guang Qin's casket and supposedly a faint silhouette which appears to look like Amitabha shine down upon the casket.

A development of the pre-war Gnome- Rh√¥ne 14K, the 14N was used on several French and German aircraft of World War II. Design and development Facing criticisms over the 14K's reliability, Gnome-Rh√¥ne undertook a major upgrade of its 14-cylinder design, using different materials for the pistons and valves, and enlarging cooling surfaces by 39%. The new 14N was introduced in 1937 and was quickly adopted on several aircraft models. In 1939, minor improvements allowed Gnome-Rh√¥ne to increase the compression ratio from 6.1:1 to 6.8:1, which resulted in increased power for wartime production aircraft. The 14N was further developed into the Gnome- Rh√¥ne 14R featuring a 2-stage supercharger, but this type was not widely used until after World War II as production of improved engines was prohibited by the terms of the armistice with Germany. Postwar the 14R was developed into a 28 cylinder high capacity engine as the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 28T-1, essentially two 14R-24 engines back to back driving co-axial contra-rotating propeller shafts.

Its focus is on preventing disease and promoting healthy lifestyles in the community of North Brooklyn through its fifteen centers. Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center falls administratively under New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. As of 2018, the current CEO is Gregory Calliste.  History  Mayor John V. Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller proposed Woodhull hospital in 1967 as a modern facility with single-occupancy patient rooms and amenities more often found in private hospitals at a cost of $85 million. It was intended to provide more accessible and personal health care to the surrounding communities of Williamsburg, Fort Greene, Bushwick, Greenpoint, and Bedford-Stuyvesant. Ground was broken in 1970 but due to budget issues the hospital was not opened until 1982, costing $308 million.Official history The emergency room was designed to accommodate 65,000 patients per year. The hospital was named after Richard M. Woodhull, the original landowner of the immediate area and credited with having laid out the Village of Williamsburg into an actual city. The name was proposed by middle school student Victor Morales of Intermediate School 318. In 2017, Woodhull became the first hospital in Brooklyn to receive the baby-friendly designation from Baby-Friendly USA, an initiative between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF). In 2018, the hospital's emergency room served nearly 110,000 patients and received $5 million in capital funds to add 5,000 square feet.  Architecture  The building was designed by Kallmann & McKinnell in the Brutalist architecture style in the 1960s. It employs a structural framework with a machinist aesthetic quality. The interior is organized by employing the Kaiser corridor system by which patient rooms are arranged along a central corridor for healthcare personnel while visitor corridors flank the perimeter and light passes through glazing into patient rooms. Artist Keith Haring created a public mural in the ambulatory care department.  Controversies  Woodhull Hospital was designed to provide every patient with a private room, resulting in many patients being transferred due to lack of space. 60% of rooms became shared to reduce the number of patients being transferred. There were also problems with security, including hallways being too narrow for police to patrol, and stairways leading outside the hospital. In 1992, Woodhull's accreditation was revoked by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations after concluding that it did not review enough surgical procedures to detect unnecessary surgery and mishaps. Prior to the inspection, administrators were accused of rewriting critical internal analyses of patient care. Later that year, Woodhull was granted full accreditation after New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation appealed that decision and corrected most of its deficiencies. By 2002, Woodhull had completely reversed its poor inspection findings of the 1990s, receiving the highest scores assigned to any hospital, public or private, and fully complying with standards for quality patient care and safety.  Programs  Woodhull has a program to address childhood asthma, which is prevalent in Brooklyn. It has a partnership with local schools and the North Brooklyn Asthma Action Alliance. Woodhull's Paul Poroski Family Center has been designated an AIDS Center by New York State. The center has the following special subdivisions: AIDS Center; Behavioral Health; Chronic Care Management; Asthma Care; Diabetes Care; Level III Perinatal Center; SAFE (Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner) SART (Sexual Assault Response Teams) Center; Women's Health.

Legatum is a partnership that uses its own funds to invest globally. The firm also invests in activities to promote entrepreneurship and free enterprise as well as anti-slavery, health and education initiatives.  History and business activities Legatum (meaning \\"legacy\\" or \\"gift\\") is a private investment firm based in Dubai using only capital provided by members of the firm. Legatum was founded in December 2006 in the United Arab Emirates by Christopher Chandler, who made his fortune in markets undergoing political disruption. Previously, Chandler was the president of Sovereign Global, or Sovereign, which he co-founded with his brother Richard Chandler in 1986. Sovereign invested capital in companies located in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in industries including telecommunications, electric utilities, steel, oil and gas, banking and oil refining. The Chandler brothers embarked on separate ventures following the de-merger of Sovereign in 2006. Christopher Chandler established Legatum the following December. In 2015, Legatum transitioned to a partnership, consisting of Christopher Chandler, Mark Stoleson, Philip Vassiliou and Alan McCormick, providing a structure for the firm to continue operating beyond its founders. In 2012, Legatum purchased a building in the Dubai International Financial Centre for its global headquarters. The building was renamed Legatum Plaza, and the company moved into the building the following year. Investments The firm's investment activities tend to focus on globally listed companies, markets in economic transition (such as Japan or China) or distressed situations. Legatum was one of the first foreign commercial investors to identify the need to provide critical equity capital to for-profit microfinance organizations in India, investing $25 million for a majority stake in SHARE Microfinance, India's leading microfinance institution. In 2006, the company co-founded an early charity crowdfunding platform, Razoo Global Corporation, based in Alexandria, VA. The platform has raised US$550 million in crowdfunding since its foundation. It announced a management buy-out of Legatum's holding in 2017. In 2007, Legatum purchased a significant minority stake in Intellecap, which provides business solutions to help support companies that are dedicated to social and environmental change. Also in 2008, Legatum and Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm founded by Pierre Omidyar, collaborated to co-invest a total of $40 million into Unitus Equity Fund II (now known as Elevar Equity). The fund is a commercial venture providing capital to businesses in the developing world targeted at serving the poor. Support to other entities and programs As of 2014, Legatum had invested around US$80 million in 1,440 projects in 107 countries. Legatum focuses on three core areas of philanthropic investment: development, entrepreneurship, and policy innovation. =Development= Legatum Foundation is the development arm of Legatum and invests in community- based organizations and projects around the world to help the poorest and most marginalized people in society. In 2015, Legatum established the Luminos Fund, a private donor philanthropic fund designed to develop and scale initiatives which help out-of-school children get back to school. Legatum founded the END Fund in 2012 to co-ordinate and support programmes to treat neglected tropical diseases, which affects over 1.5 billion people globally. Legatum first started funding NTD work in 2006, after Legatum partner Alan McCormick visited Professor Alan Fenwick (Professor of Tropical Parasitology) at Imperial College London, who in turn had founded the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative in 2002. It has since led to Legatum investing over $10m in efforts to eliminate NTDs. In 2013, in partnership with Humanity United and Walk Free, Legatum established a $100 million fund called the Freedom Fund. The aim of the fund is to help eradicate modern day slavery, an illegal industry that generates over $32 billion in profits every year around the world. =Entrepreneurship= In 2007, Legatum established The Legatum Center for Entrepreneurship at MIT with the aim to create a generation of business leaders in developing countries by providing them with the skills needed to succeed as entrepreneurs. Fellowships are granted to students who show entrepreneurial ambition and an interest in making a lasting and positive economic impact on low-income countries. Legatum established the annual Africa Awards for Entrepreneurship program which recognizes and rewards business leaders who serve as role models to Africa's aspiring entrepreneurs. The program has been in operation since 2007 and is now run by the African Leadership Network, with Legatum still involved as a lead sponsor. In 2008, Legatum partnered with Fortune magazine to announce the Legatum Fortune Technology Prize, a $1 million award intended to reward for-profit businesses who provide products and services to the needy through the use of technology. By 2014, the Center had launched over 20 enterprises across 40 countries. The Legatum fellows have pursued businesses that tackle social issues such as improving sanitation by converting waste products into fertilizer in Kenya, establishing plastic recycling businesses in Nigeria, and improving the apparel industry's conditions in Tanzania. =Policy= Legatum Foundation is a sponsor of the Legatum Institute, an independent non-partisan policy, advisory and advocacy organization based in London.

Background  Tun Fuad Stephens came to power during the 1976 Sabah state elections which were held from 5 April to 14 April 1976. His Berjaya party won 28 of the 48 seats contested, defeating the previous governing party United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) led by Tun Mustapha. Tun Fuad was sworn in as the 5th chief minister of Sabah on 15 April 1976. On the 53rd day after he won the elections, the aircraft he boarded crashed on the way to Kota Kinabalu Airport. Alt URL Released online since 7 March 2013 courtesy of Chaos Computer Club Berlin. In the evening of 5 June 1976 (Saturday), Tun Fuad with his brother Ben Stephens and other Berjaya leaders gathered at Labuan Golf Club to host a post-victory celebration for Tun Fuad's old friend, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Tengku Razaleigh was the federal finance minister and also a chairman of Petronas, a Malaysian oil and gas company. Tun Mustapha, former chief minister of Sabah, had previously refused to sign the 5% oil agreement with Petronas. Tun Fuad, Tengku Razaleigh, and other Berjaya leaders had a chat until 6:00 am next morning. Then, Tun Fuad and his brother went to Kota Kinabalu in order to flag-off a charity walkathon held in the morning. Datuk Peter Mojuntin, another Berjaya leader, decided to stay at Labuan in order to officiate at a Berjaya party branch's victory celebrations. Tun Fuad met his eldest son Johari Stephens at the walkathon. Tun Fuad insisted that his eldest son Johari should follow him to Labuan in order to visit the official opening of RM 100 million oil refinery. However, Tun Fuad and his son never make the trip to the refinery because of their own busy schedule. Tun Fuad then went back to Labuan Golf Club in order to meet Tengku Razaleigh. Tun Fuad and Tengku Razaleigh had a lunch at a beach near a village called Layang-Layang. After that, they decided to return to Kota Kinabalu earlier for the preparation of an official banquet at Istana Negeri (State Palace) at night where Tengku Razaleigh and Tun Fuad were to sign the Petronas deal. At 3:00 pm, Tun Fuad, Tengku Razaleigh, and other Berjaya leaders boarded the government-chartered, twin engine, ten-seater Australian Nomad aircraft owned by Sabah Air. Peter Mojuntin was among those aboard. Peter originally planned to board the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight back to Kota Kinabalu at 1:30 pm scheduled on the same day. However, Peter was persuaded by Tun Fuad to fly back to Kota Kinabalu with him because Tun Fuad wanted to discuss some matter with Peter on board the flight. Peter also cancelled the MAS flight and declined an invitation to travel in another GAF Nomad aircraft that were seated with another Berjaya leader Datuk Harris Salleh and Sarawak chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub. In April 2010, Tengku Razaleigh claimed that he was seated behind Tun Fuad while Abdul Rahman Ya'kub was seated on Tengku's right side in the Nomad aircraft when Harris Salleh came in last minute and asked Tengku to exit the aircraft in order to inspect a cattle ranch at Banggi Island. Tengku agreed and he invited Abdul Rahman to follow him. Speech by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah (In Malay). Uploaded on 3 April 2010. URL assessed on 29 June 2015. Ishak Atan, the private secretary to Tengku Razaleigh, decided to stay back with Tun Fuad's aircraft because he wanted to prepare the documents for the signing ceremony in Kota Kinabalu. Tun Fuad's aircraft took off first followed by Harris's aircraft. Tun Fuad's aircraft also carried heavy goods from duty-free port of Labuan such as expensive golf equipments and coloured television sets. Nomad aircraft were not fitted with a black box to record all its course changes and altitudes at that time. However, Tengku Razaleigh gave a different account of the last minute events in the book titled \\"The Sabahan:The Life and Death of Tun Fuad Stephens\\" which was published back in 1999. Tengku claimed that he met Harris Salleh at the beach near the Layang-Layang village when the latter asked him to go to Banggi Island to inspect a cattle ranch. Tengku Razaleigh agreed and went to the Labuan airport. Tengku then climbed into the Tun Fuad's aircraft and asked Abdul Rahman to accompany him to Banggi Island. According to Borneo Bulletin newspaper published on 12 June 1976, Tun Fuad's son, Johari Stephens (25 years old, trainee pilot) asked if he could ride the aircraft in the co-pilot seat. The request was granted and the aircraft took off from Labuan. The flight from Labuan to Kota Kinabalu usually takes around 40 minutes. Tun Fuad's aircraft should have landed at 3:30 pm at the Kota Kinabalu Airport. The weather was good and the VIP aircraft should have received immediate clearance for landing. However, the aircraft circled and approached the airport from the north. It was claimed that the ground control tower instructed the aircraft to make another turn because of an inbound MAS-737 flight to the airport. An airport official claimed that there were conflicting instructions from the ground control tower.  The crash  George Mojuntin, the eldest son of the Mojuntin family, was one of the eyewitnesses of the aircraft crash. He and his friends were playing golf when the aircraft crashed into the Sembulan Sea while it was trying to land at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport. The aircraft was 600 feet above, flying at 86 knots, approaching the runway from the north, seemed to stalled mid-air with one wing dipped down and suddenly spiraled (exactly one and a half turns) towards the shallow sea which was three feet deep and crashed. It was 3:41 pm and 27 seconds. Eyewitnesses at Kampung Sembulan Baru reported that they heard an explosion at about 3:30 pm. When they rushed out from their homes, they saw an aircraft broken into two with cockpit embedded in the sandbank about three feet deep. Parts of the aircraft was embedded in the sea while part of it was exposed above the water. According to Far Eastern Economic Review published on 18 June 1976, the aircraft flown over the Kampung Sembulan Baru at 200 to 300 feet as it approaches the north eastern end of the runway. The aircraft was veering from side to side before it went into a spiral and crashed. The aircraft was in a total wreck. Blood was coming out from the wrecked aircraft and dyed the surrounding waters into crimson colour. The crash scene is located less than 50 feet from the nearest village Kampung Sembulan Baru and 3 km from the airport. Tun Fuad brother Ben Stephens and Police Commissioner Yusof Khan were among the first who arrived at the scene. The Police Commissioner cut open the aircraft. Among the first items floated out from the crash scene was Tun Fuad white shoes. Ben Stephens and the Police Commissioner managed to pull out the body of Tun Fuad's bodyguard named Corporal Said who was seated at the back of the aircraft. Police Commissioner Yusof Khan recalled: All the bodies were converged at the cockpit except for one who was still in strapped into position by his safety belt. The cockpit was buried into the ground. Captain Nathan was found at the pilot seat while Johari Stephens (Tun Fuad's son) was found at the co-pilot seat. All the bodies were mutilated beyond recognition except for Peter Mojuntin face who still remained intact. One head was found to be severed and located at a distance from the body. One eyewitness described the condition as \\"their bodies turned jelly with practically every bone in their bodies broken or smashed\\". Firemen were the first to arrive at the scene. Policemen then came to seal off the area. Axes were used to cut open the aircraft and 11 bodies were removed. 2 revolvers, 5 watches, and RM 6,000 cash were recovered. All the bodies were rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for stitching. Doctors worked for more than 6 hours to stitch up the body parts. Ben Stephens and Tengku Razaleigh then arrived at the mortuary for formal identification of the bodies. Passengers and crew The crash killed all 11 on board the flight, including five ministers, * Tun Fuad Stephens, Chief Minister of Sabah * Datuk Peter Mojuntin, Sabah Minister of Local Government and Housing  Subsequent events  The aircraft crash created a vacuum in Berjaya party leadership. It also created five vacant Sabah state assembly seats where by-elections would be held on 31 July 1976 with nomination day on 15 July. On 21 June 1976, Barisan Nasional accepted the applications from Berjaya and USNO to join the coalition. USNO had agreed not to contest in the by-elections, leaving Berjaya to face the competitions by independents, Sabah Chinese Association, BERSATU and PEKEMAS. Tun Fuad's death leaving behind his wife Rahimah Stephens and 4 children who were still studying in Australia at that time. The prime minister of Malaysia, Datuk Hussein Onn immediately launched a full-scale investigation on the cause of the aircraft crash. The investigation team was led by Colonel Osman Saman, consisting of officers from the Aviation Department, the Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Royal Malaysian Police, and other associated departments. Government sources at that time mentioned that it was abnormal for the aircraft to take a spin before crashing into the sea. Therefore, foul play was suspected and the aircraft could have been tampered with before it took off from Labuan airport. At 6:00 pm on the same day, Deputy chief minister of Sabah Datuk Harris Salleh, choking with emotions, broke the news to the nation. He said that: Harris Salleh was still grievous and he was reluctant to assume the post of chief minister. However, after Tengku Razaleigh's persuasions, Harris sworn in as the sixth chief minister of Sabah just before midnight on the same day. Hussein Onn insisted on state funerals for the dead state leaders. However, problems arose because the deceased leaders were of different religions. It was later decided that all the state leaders' coffins will be gathered inside the Kota Kinabalu Community Centre. After that, the leaders' coffins will left the building in a single file and break off in different directions to various cemeteries. Peter Mojuntin's body was carried back to his home at Kampung Hungab, Penampang. Peter's body was later escorted to the community centre. Tun Fuad's body was also sent to the same community centre. Prime minister Hussein Onn flown to Sabah on the next day morning to attend the state funeral of Tun Fuad. The prime minister and his cabinet ministers would pay their last respects between 1pm and 2 pm on the same day. Peter's body was later brought to St Michael's church for the last rites at 2:45 pm. A Requiem mass was held. After the mass, Peter's coffin was opened for the last time for the public. The coffin was buried later on the same day. Tun Fuad's body was later buried at a mosque. A public holiday was declared on 7 June 1976. Flags were flown at half mast by the state and federal government departments and commercial houses. One week later on 14 June 1976, Harris Salleh signed the 5% oil royalty agreement. Harris also delivered a eulogy in the Sabah State Legislative Assembly: Harris later admitted that he found himself being pushed around by the federal government and he was too young to stand up against its demands. However, if Tun Fuad was still alive, he may be able to stand up against it because he was more senior and had the respect of the federal government.  Investigation results  Australian GAF Nomad aircraft manufacturer decided to launch an investigation in order to prove that the crash was not due to mechanical defect. The company sent its chief pilot, Stuart Pearce, and chief designer David Hooper, to investigate the crash. They were also accompanied by two Australian Department of Transport Officials. The Australian Department of Transport had previously issued the aircraft's certificate of fitness. On 28 October 1976, 4.5 months after the tragedy, the investigations were over. Investigation findings were not made public. Deputy Communication Minister, Enche Mohd Ali bin M Sharif instead made a statement about the investigation findings: On 22 June 1976, Australian Broadcasting Corporation announced the findings from the GAF investigations, which determined that the cause of the accident was due to pilot error; however, additional details was not released by them. The Australian investigation report remained classified since then. The report titled \\"G. Bennett - Sabah Air Nomad - Report by Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) investigation team on a crash of Nomad aircraft in Malaysia 9M - ATZ on 6 June 1976\\" is currently hosted at National Archives of Australia under Series no: B5535 and restriction number of 33(1)(a) because \\"Malaysia has not as yet publicly released their final and full report of the investigation\\". , 41 years after the air crash happened, the Malaysian government has not declassified the investigative reports of the crash. In 2017, the Sabah chief minister Musa Aman, in a question-and-answer session in the state assembly, said that the reports are still classified because \\"Sabah Civil Aviation Department has no new information on the crash\\". Possible explanations Aircraft overloading - If the Nomad aircraft is not operated within strict weight limit, it will behave unpredictably when the speed is low, especially when the aircraft is landing. This fact has not been mentioned in the flight manual during the time when Double Six Crash occurred. Since the aircraft was carrying heavy goods when it was landing at the Kota Kinabalu Airport at a low altitude (600 feet), the pilot would not have to time to respond and maneuver the aircraft out from the spin and perform an emergency landing. Pilot error - Captain Nathan may have allowed the eldest son of Tun Fuad, Johari Stephen, who was also a trainee pilot, to control the aircraft. This was suspected because Johari's body was found in the co-pilot seat. The aircraft may have gone into a spin when Johari tried to pull the heavily loaded aircraft too steeply out of his landing approach. However, the opposite is equally likely. Captain Nathan, with many years of flying experience, could easily pull the aircraft out of a spin and save the aircraft from a deadly crash. However, in 2004, both Toh Puan Hajjah Rahimah Stephens (wife of Tun Fuad) and Datuk Harris Salleh agreed that \\"pilot error\\" was the main cause of the crash. Design flaw of the aircraft - This is the second Nomad aircraft crash following the first crash on 3 October 1973 when the aircraft was leased to Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as A18-002 in July 1973. The 3rd Nomad aircraft crash occurred on 6 August 1976 during a test flight at Avalon Airport, Australia, exactly 2 months after the Malaysian Double Six Crash. In November 1995, 20 years after the Double Six Crash, the Four Corners TV series of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which is noted for its investigative expos√©s, ran a programme on the dangers of Nomad aircraft which had been suppressed over the years. At the time when the programme was broadcast, there were a total of 19 Nomad accidents with 56 deaths. It was the aircraft crash flown by Glen Donovan on 12 March 1990 that caused a mutiny among Australian army pilots and the usage of all military Nomads were discontinued after that. Harry Bradford was a former RAAF test pilot. He found controllability issues of the aircraft especially during its handling on approach and landing. However, his reports were being suppressed because it could harm the reputation GAF and Australian national interests. A former GAF design engineer, Paul Hughes, bought 16 Nomad aircraft through his own corporation. However, soon after that, he filed a legal suit against Nomad for a number of aircraft defects such as a defective tail design and maximum weight limit that the aircraft can carry which was far lower than advertised weight limit. The Australian government finally paid A$ 4 million to Hughes Corporation. Hughes then disposed of 15 out of 16 aircraft that he had bought. Tun Fuad's family now believed that the aircraft faulty design is a more likely cause of the Double Six Crash. Aftermath monument erected at the site of the crash in Sembulan as a remembrance to all victims who perished in the tragedy. A monument known as the Double Six Monument was later built at the crash site in order to commemorate the tragedy. Malaysian Home Ministry has banned the book titled Peter J Mojuntin - The Golden Son of The Kadazan as soon as it was published in May 1978. The book contains detailed description of events happened before, during, and after the aircraft crash. The ban has not been lifted since then in order to ensure \\"public safety as the book was very critical of the federal government\\". Since 2010, various quarters have been seeking to lift the ban on the book. In July 2010, former Sabah chief minister Harris Salleh filed a defamation suit against another former Sabah chief minister Yong Teck Lee following claims that Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah (former Petronas chairman) did not board the ill-fated flight when Harris asked Razaleigh to join him for another flight to Banggi Island to inspect a cattle farm. Yong had called for a new investigation in the case in order to find the exact cause of the aircraft crash. On 28 February 2012, Sabah High Court ruled that Yong had \\"crossed the line\\" by using the words \\"crime\\" and \\"assassination\\" against Harris Salleh. Yong was ordered to pay RM 1 million in damages to Harris. However, on 19 November 2013, Court of Appeal ordered Harris to refund the entire amount of damages back to Yong. On 26 September 2017, the Federal Court of Malaysia ordered Yong to compensate Harris RM 600,000 because Yong implicated Harris of having ‚Äúblood on his hands‚Äù despite having no proof of backing up his statement.

It was established by Dmitry Ivanovich Vinogradov in 1744 and was supported by the Russian tsars since Empress Elizabeth. Many still refer to the factory by its well-known former name, the Lomonosov Porcelain Factory. History Russian porcelain in Kuskovo =18th century= Attempts to reveal the secret of hard paste true porcelain-making had expanded to Russia since the visit of Peter the Great to Saxony in 1718; there, he saw Meissen porcelain at the Dresden court. Dmitry Ivanovich Vinogradov, a talented mining engineer who studied metallurgy at Freiberg, Saxony, invented the formula for the first porcelain manufactory in Russia, established in 1744 by order of Empress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great, to \\"serve native trade and native art.\\"The Lomonosov Porcelain Story, , accessed 18 June 2007 For a long time, the factory produced wares almost exclusively for the ruling Romanov family and the Russian Imperial court, and for political and diplomatic gifts by them. Dinner services, often very large indeed, were a staple, and from the 1780s, figures of Russian peasants and ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire taken from book illustrations. These last continued until the Revolution, and largely replaced the repertoire of pastoral, gallant, and commedia dell'arte figures familiar from factories in the rest of Europe. From the arrival of Neoclassical styles, the factory became known for large and ornate vases with painted scenes. The Russian porcelain by Vinogradov had qualities similar to Meissen porcelain, while its formula (which consisted of only Russian ingredients) took its style from Chinese porcelain. At the beginning of the Vinogradov period, the motifs were monochrome and simplified; by the end of this period, the fine miniatures were completed on porcelain. Gold leaf for gilding porcelain was prepared from golden coins from the Imperial Treasury. ‚ÄòThe Golden Age of Catherine‚Äô ‚Äì the reign of Catherine II the Great ‚Äì was the age of prosperity for the fine Russian porcelain. In 1765, the manufactory was renamed the Imperial Porcelain Manufactory (IPM). From the very beginning of Catherine's reign, IPM was obliged to produce fine porcelain and also to bring profit. The Imperial Court's need for porcelain was large, and the permanent orders from the Court let IPM maintain the highest quality. During the reign of Paul I (1796 to 1801), Russian porcelain continued to develop in style of Neoclassicism, with the increasing influence of Hellenic and Roman motifs.

In 1806, with the imposition of Napoleon's Continental Blockade, the import of porcelain to Russia was banned and competition between a variety of Russian private porcelain factories arose. The production line of IPM porcelain was divided into a department for producing expensive low-profit Royal presents and a department producing ordinary porcelain for consumers among the Russian nobility. =1825‚Äì1894= From the reign of Nicholas I (1825 to 1855), imported kaolin from Limoges began to be used. Porcelain plaques and large porcelain items of high perfection were made. A special method of durable fire gilding that could be burnished was invented, although subsequently lost. Nicholas I took a personal part in the managing of IPM. The projects for porcelain items were handed in to him for his confirmation. The manufactory's own museum was established in 1844. Later on, a library was formed from books on art, paintings and engravings. By the beginning of the reign of Alexander II (1855 to 1881), IPM worked only with imported raw materials. A year before the abolition of serfdom, the IPM workers had been given their freedom, but many of them continued to work at IPM. However, the number of the Imperial Court's orders decreased. The porcelain was produced mainly on old models. From the beginning of the 1870s, copying of famous paintings on porcelain ceased, and landscapes were rarely painted. Instead, purely ornamental decoration prevailed. IPM started to use coloured glazes and to decorate their porcelain with p√¢te-sur-p√¢te patterns. The idea of closing down the ‚Äòuseless and unprofitable‚Äô enterprise emerged in 1881. Later on, the idea transformed into the assignation of IPM to the Imperial Academy of Arts, but Alexander III, whose reign had just started, commanded the best possible conditions (from a technological and arts point of view) for IPM so that IPM could bear its name \\"Imperial\\" with dignity and set a standard for all private porcelain manufactory owners. In 1889, the new formula was invented for the dark red sang-de-boeuf glaze. Since 1892, the underglaze decoration technology had been mastered with the help of Danish experts. The Russian Emperor was married to a Danish princess and paid interest to the underglaze painting. =1894‚Äì1917= By the beginning of the 20th century, IPM had become one of the leading porcelain factories in Europe. IPM porcelain was famous for its exceptional quality. It was produced from paste made of the highest quality ingredients on up-to-date equipment. This paste was stored in cellars for 10 years before use in production. The Art Nouveau style influenced the shapes of the porcelain. Porcelain was produced with whimsically curved forms decorated by stylized plants, mermaids and other Art Nouveau motifs. As a rule, the vases were covered by underglaze decor. Every vase had a unique form. The underglaze decoration made it possible for the artists to paint changeable seasons and winter landscapes. IPM began to produce technical and chemical porcelain due to the end of imports of porcelain from Germany during World War I. The production of fine porcelain was decreased to a minimal level. All the fine porcelain items produced were sold at charity auctions benefitting the Royal hospitals. Only Easter eggs were produced in large quantities for Easter celebrations of soldiers. =Soviet period= Cobalt net, the trademark style of the Imperial Porcelain Factory. With the abolition of the Russian monarchy in 1917, the Imperial Porcelain Factory was renamed \\"State Porcelain Factory\\" (GFZ - Gossudarstvennyi Farforovyi Zavod) by the Bolshevik regime. During the early years of the Soviet Union, the GFZ produced so-called propaganda wares, ranging from plates to figurines of the Soviet elite.After the October Revolution, , accessed 18 June 2007 In 1925, on the occasion of the 200th jubilee of the Russian Academy of Science, it was given the name of the academy's founder, Mikhail Lomonosov. It became known as the Leningrad Lomonosov Porcelain Factory (LFZ - Leningradski Farforovyi Zavod imeni M.V. Lomonosova).Porcelain of the Czars, , accessed 18 June 2007 The newly christened Lomonosov factory produced a range of wares, including collectible animal figurines and dinner sets. Its best-known pattern, cobalt net, first appeared in 1949. The design is based on a blue net pattern that was painted on raised lines cast into the porcelain dinnerware pieces of Catherine the Great. The factory has actual examples of Catherine's dinnerware with this design. The new design pattern is a combination of intersecting lines of cobalt blue with inverted tear drops of cobalt blue (made from mineral cobalt) and 22 karat gold accents.About Lomonosov Porcelain, , accessed 18 June 2007 There is also a version that artist Anna Yatskevich, the author of the famous cobalt net, painted a set in memory of the cross-glued windows of houses and the cross-light of searchlights that illuminated the sky of besieged Leningrad. These crosses on the windows were used as a device reducing small vibrations because of strong blast wave. The History of the Russian Imperial Porcelain Manufacture. =Post-Soviet era= LFZ was privatized in 1993 as the \\"Lomonosov Porcelain Factory\\". At that time, wide exports began to countries unfamiliar with Lomonosov wares, particularly the United States and Japan. KKR and The U.S. Russia Investment Fund owned 51% until 1999, when the Russian government nationalized the company. In 2002, LFZ was sold to Nikolai Tsvetkov, President of Nikoil. Return to old name On 29 May 2005, the stockholders of Lomonosov Porcelain Factory passed a resolution to return to their pre-Soviet name, the Imperial Porcelain Manufactory.\\"Press Releases\\" archive, Official Lomonosov Porcelain Factory website, , accessed 18 June 2007 (in Russian) The IPM has recently started to produce hand-made copies of porcelain from the range of Imperial porcelain exhibited in the State Hermitage Museum collection. This range includes dinner sets, collectable plates, vases, figurines from the famous series of the Russian Peoples and other porcelain items from the assortment of porcelain made here since the foundation of the manufactory in 1744. Post-Soviet backstamps The first post-Soviet export backstamp was a red LFZ monogram, with \\"Made in Russia\\" stamped in red. After 2002, a new export backstamp appeared which featured a red or blue LFZ monogram along with the words \\"Hand Decorated, 1744, St. Petersburg, Russia\\".

The purpose of the ISM Code * To ensure safety at sea and prevent damage to property, personnel and environment. In order to comply with the ISM Code, the Company operating the vessel has to be audited first (after they submit their Safety Management System Manual (SMS) and is approved by Flag Administration or Recognized Organization (RO). Once a Company is Audited, the Document of Compliance (DOC) will be issued (validity 5 years). Every Company is subject to auditing every year (three months before and after anniversary date and before DOC expiration date). Upon issuing DOC to Company (or Managing Company) each vessel can be audited to verify vessel compliance with ISM Code. Each vessel will be issued SMC (Safety Management Certificate) valid for 5 years and subject to verification of Compliance with ISM Code between second and third years of certificate validity. Safety Management System Manual consists of the following elements: * Commitment from top management * A top tier policy manual * A procedures manual that documents what is done on board the ship, during normal operations and in emergency situations * Procedures for conducting both internal and external audits to ensure the ship is doing what is documented in the procedures manual * A designated person ashore to serve as the link between the ships and shore staff and to verify the SMS implementation * A system for identifying where actual practices do not meet those that are documented and for implementing associated corrective action * Regular management reviews Also, the ship must be maintained in conformity with the provisions of relevant rules and regulations and with any additional requirements which may be established by the company. Comments from the auditor and/or audit body and from the ship are incorporated into the SMS by headquarters. The requirements of the ISM Code may be applied to all commercial ships over 500 GT. The ISM Code is a chapter in SOLAS. If SOLAS does not apply then ISM is not mandatory. Compliance with ISM Code is sometimes required by vessel client regardless of Gross Tonnage ( GT). The ISM Code was created by the IMO and Ferriby Marine's Capt. Graham Botterill, Specialist Advisor to the House of Lords in the UK on ship safety, among others. History of the development of the ISM Code On the evening of March 6, 1987, the cross-channel Ro-Ro ferry Herald of Free Enterprise, carrying more than 450 passengers, around 80 crew, more than 80 cars, and close to 50 freight vehicles, left the Belgian port of Zeebrugge for the English port of Dover. Soon after the Herald of Free Enterprise passed Zeebrugge's breakwater, water flooded into the ferry's lower car deck and destabilized it, causing it to sink in a matter of minutes. 193 lives were lost. The immediate cause of the accident was that the bow door remained wide open, allowing a great inrush of water as the vessel increased speed, while the fatigued assistant boatswain directly responsible for closing it lay asleep in his cabin. The public inquiry led by Justice Sheen revealed that the assistant boatswain's negligence was simply the last in a long string of actions that laid the groundwork for a major accident. The Sheen Report did not stop at identifying the shortcomings of the ship's master and his crew. The inquiry revealed that the shore management, Townsend Car Ferries Ltd., was just as blameworthy. Numerous memos written by Townsend ship's masters pointing out the need to implement safety-enhancing measures or address serious deficiencies on board their vessels went unheeded (Rasmussen and Svedung, 2000). The report summed up the management's cavalier attitude towards safety in the following statement: 'From top to bottom the body corporate was infected with the disease of sloppiness' (Sheen, 1987). The Herald of Free Enterprise was a modern ferry equipped with advanced technology and manned by a highly qualified crew. Only seven years prior to the accident, it was built in a German shipyard according to international maritime safety regulations. Why did it capsize? The general frustration in the shipping industry following the capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise is typical of the kind of accident that precipitated in a paradigm shift in maritime safety administration and the development of the ISM Code.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Page 426. The clan does not currently have a chief and is therefore considered an Armigerous clan. History =Origins= The name MacQueen is sometimes also given as MacSween which means son of Sweyn. The MacQueens are allegedly of the same descent as the Clan Donald, having kinship with the High Kings of Ireland. The MacQueens are said to have provided a guard for a daughter of the chief of Clan MacDonald of Clan Ranald, who married a chief of the Clan Mackintosh. The Mackintosh clan were also chiefs of the Chattan Confederation and so the MacQueens settled around Findhorn and became part of the confederation of Clan Chattan. The Clan MacQueen was then known as the Clan Revan. The chiefs became the Lairds of Corrieborough and were highly regarded amongst the supporters of the MacDonalds. =18th century= The chief of the Clan MacDonald of Sleat said in 1778: \\"it does me great honour to have the sons of the Chieftains in the Regiment and as the MacQueens have been invariably attached to our family, to whom we believe we owe our existence, I am proud of the nomination\\". The MacQueens or MacSweens were numerous in the Hebrides. The Reverend of Snizort, Donald MacQueen was of such intellect that he even impressed the doctor Samuel Johnson when he visited the Hebrides. The name MacQueen was not always highly regarded as Robert McQueen, Lord Braxfield, a notorious 18th-century judge was feared for his savage sentences and use of the death penalty. The chief's family is believed to have moved to New Zealand and the clan became scattered throughout Scotland and the rest of the English-speaking world.  Modern clan symbolism  The MacQueen tartan, as published in the Vestiarium Scoticum in 1842. Today the Vestiarium is considered a Victorian era hoax. Today members of Scottish clans show their clan allegiance by wearing Scottish crest badges, clan tartans and sometimes clan badges (plant badges). The crest badge suitable for members of Clan MacQueen contains the heraldic crest of an heraldic tyger rampant Ermine holding an arrow, point downwards Argent pheoned Gules. The heraldic motto that appears upon the crest badge is CONSTANT AND FAITHFUL. Another badge sometimes used by clan members is a clan badge (or plant badge). Several different clan badges have been attributed to various MacQueens. The MacQueens associated with Clan Chattan are attributed boxwood and red whortleberry as a clan badge. Many other Scottish clans which are closely associated with Clan Chattan have been attributed the same plants. The MacQueen‚Äôs of Skye, on the other hand, have common heath attributed as their clan badge. Common heath is the clan badge of many of the clans associated with Clan Donald.Adam; Innes of Learney (1970), pp. 541‚Äì543 The MacQueen tartan was first published in 1842, in the Vestiarium Scoticum. The Vestiarium was the work of the dubious \\"Sobieski Stuarts\\" and is today considered a Victorian era hoax. The tartan is supposedly that of Clan Revan, being named after Revan MacMulmor MacAngus MacQueen who led a MacDonald bride to be married to a chief of Clan Mackintosh. The Scottish Tartans World Register (STWR) notes that the MacQueen tartan is similar to the Fraser and Gunn tartans, which both have four bold stripes. However, the STWR considers it to be a combination of the MacDonald and Mackintosh tartans. The tartan scholar D. C. Stewart noted that the MacQueen tartan is the reverse of the MacKeane tartan, possibly because of the two similar-sounding names, even though both names have a different history.Stewart (1974), p. 49.

Incorporating elements of Sleeping Beauty, it was published as part of the Fairy Tale Series of novels compiled by Terri Windling. The novel won the annual Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature in 1993. It was also nominated for the Nebula Award. Plot summary The book is divided into two parts, the \\"home\\", and the \\"castle\\". The ending is part of the \\"home\\" section, returning after the castle. The story is based around the German fairy tale of Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) which is told by \\"Gemma\\", an elderly woman, to her three granddaughters. She tells this to the children almost all the time and it is the only bedtime story she ever tells. The times when \\"Gemma\\" tells the story are flashbacks and alternate between the present- day story. =\\"Home\\"= In the present day, Gemma's Jewish family is living somewhere outside a city in Massachusetts. After her grandmother's death, Rebecca Berlin, the youngest of her three granddaughters (referred to as Becca in the novel) begins to believe that there is some meaning behind the bedtime story that her grandmother told to them hundreds of times. She consults Stan, a good friend and journalist who works for an \\"alternative\\" newspaper and uncovers historical facts. She discovers that her grandmother was actually a survivor of the Holocaust who was persecuted for her Jewish origins, and sent to Che≈Çmno extermination camp to be executed. She decides to visit Che≈Çmno and discovers a link with a man by the name of Josef Potocki in Poland. Becca sets off for Poland to find the identity and the life of her grandmother. =The Castle - Josef's story= In Poland, Josef tells his life story and his meeting with Gemma. In the book, his story is told in the \\"castle\\" section. He was a target of the Holocaust due to his homosexuality, and became a fugitive, during which time he met many different people, mainly partisans, mainly in Germany. He had heard stories of torture and extermination camps and joined an underground group set out to rescue victims. This leads him to Che≈Çmno (called Kulmhof by the Germans), where he witnesses the gassing to death of numerous people. The people are brought to the camp and then packed into trucks. The trucks drive away, with their exhaust funnelled into the passenger hold. By the time the trucks arrive at their destination, a mass grave, all of the people it was carrying have been gassed to death by the truck exhaust. The people are then dumped into the grave. When the bodies are dumped one of the partisans, named The Avenger notices that a woman with red hair (Gemma) is still alive and faintly breathing. Josef revives her through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which the woman, (who is later called KSIƒò≈ªNICZKA, which means 'princess' in Polish) refers to in her fairy tale as \\"the kiss of life\\". In reality, during this period of time, 320,000 were killed in Chelmno via the method of gassing them in trucks. Later, she hid in the forest with Polish partisans, fighting the Nazis, and married The Avenger, whom Josef was also in love with. She became pregnant by him shortly after their marriage. Then he, along with almost all of the other partisans, was killed by the Nazis. She escaped and was brought safely to the United States. She never told a soul about these experiences, rather dealing with the trauma by refashioning them in her mind into the form of a familiar fairytale about an evil witch, a princess rendered unconscious who is then revived by a handsome prince, and a happy ending. ='Home Again'= The final part of the book is simply a conclusion where Becca returns to the U.S. to tell Stan and her family about what she discovered. At the airport, Stan is there to pick her up. He kisses her, and says \\"We'll get to our happily ever after eventually\\". Style =Juxtaposition= The story was written to juxtapose the present-day story with the fairy tale that Gemma tells them. In the book, every odd chapter (except for within the Castle) is a flashback to Becca's childhood in which Gemma tells her story to her grandchildren. Gemma is a victim of the holocaust. =Setting at Che≈Çmno= At the Che≈Çmno extermination camp ~340,000 people, mainly Jewish prisoners, were killed. The extermination of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto took place in Che≈Çmno. Response Briar Rose has received a very warm response from most critics, especially for its unusual organization. The book is not told in a direct beginning-to-end style, and the story is not told directly to the reader but rather through the fairy tale. Critics praised it for this type of storytelling technique, and in 1992 the Science Fiction Chronicle awarded Briar Rose the Best fantasy Novel of the Year. Briar Rose was also part of Australia's New South Wales Department of Education and Training's Higher School Certificate curriculum. Kirsten Dunst has listed it as her favorite book.

Founded by the Catholic diocese as a seminary school in 1932 and undergoing several name changes, it has been managed by the Jesuits since 1983. It took its present name in 2010 when it became affiliated with Sophia University.  History  The school traces its origin to 1932 when a bishop from the Paris Foreign Missions Society opened Fukuoka Christian Theological Seminary for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fukuoka. In 1934 upon recognition by the prefect governor of Fukuoka it was named Hirao Academy. In 1936 it was renamed Taisei Junior High School. In 1946 the Catholic Marian Association took charge of the school. In 1948 the high school opened and in 1951 the Taizon Academy School Corporation was formed. In 1959 the junior high school closed. In 1969 the Fukuoka Diocese again took control of the school, and moved it to its present location in 1974. In 1983 the Society of Jesus assumed management of the school and began an expansion program, reopening the middle school the following year. An exchange program with Auckland, New Zealand, began in 1989. By 1991 the middle and high school systems were integrated. In 2010 an educational alliance was signed with Sophia University and the next year the school was renamed Sophia Fukuoka Junior and Senior High School. In 2012 the school began to admit girls, from the first year level. School life  The educational philosophy follows that of the Jesuits: always seek the greater good and be men and women for and with others. The eagle, the symbol of Sophia University, is on the shield along with the words Lux Veritatis (\\"light of truth\\") and the English name \\"SOPHIA FUKUOKA.\\" The school colors are dark blue, deep red, and golden yellow. The school song since 2011 has been \\"Wagame Sophia's Eagle\\" with music and lyrics by Mitsuru Arai. Until the school name was changed in 2011 the song was \\"Taizon Academy School Song.\\" Sponsored sports include, for boys only, handball, soccer, softball, and basketball; for girls, volleyball; for boys and girls, Kendo, field, tennis, table tennis, badminton, and judo. Within a network of Jesuit schools, Sophia shares initiatives based on the educational philosophy of educating \\"men and women for and with others.\\" Seven participants from five Jesuit Schools in Fukuoka, Sydney, Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Manila have participated in a shared life for one week. Sophia also participates in the AFS student exchange programs, recently with Iceland, the Netherlands, and Austria. Also Sophia has been supporting Col√©gio de Santo In√°cio de Loiola in East Timor.

The viaduct has now been shifted to the right. The Newmarket Viaduct, sometimes considered 'one of the most distinctive engineering features' of New Zealand, is a seven-lane state highway viaduct in Auckland, the country's largest city. Carrying the Southern Motorway over the Newmarket suburb area southeast of the CBD of the city, the 700 m long viaduct is up to 20 m high in places.  Original structure  The viaduct was opened on 3 September 1966 at a cost of NZ$2.26 million, and was constructed as New Zealand's first pair of balanced cantilever bridges. With its long spans, the s-curvature and the varying superelevation of the motorway, it is a complex structure even today, and at the time was a ground-breaking design for New Zealand.Engineering to 1990 - IPENZ, Engineering Publications Co Ltd, Page 10 While considered a successful design, it was built to far lower earthquake standards than those which other New Zealand structures now fulfill, being built to survive only a 1 in 500-year return period earthquake. It could have received significant damage in an earthquake as common as once in 200 years.From Viaduct to Viaduct - e.nz magazine, IPENZ, November/9 December, Page 42 This made the structure the weakest strategic transport infrastructure link in the Auckland area, with a potential collapse cutting off all motorway transport to the south. Also, during design, temperature stresses were not yet understood to a sufficient degree, leading to increased wear on structural elements. 'Concrete box' structure as seen from below, looking west. A truck once toppled over the left side near here.  Plans for replacement  The limited earthquake stability, together with increasing traffic demands (over 200,000 vehicles a day, more than on the Auckland Harbour Bridge and the most traffic on a section of road anywhere in New Zealand),SH1 Newmarket Viaduct - The New Zealand Herald, Saturday 30 June 2007, Page C6 led to the planning for a new viaduct structure, which would be able to withstand an earthquake with a 2,500-year return period. Other factors were the very low safety barriers (which once allowed an out-of-control truck to fall onto its roof 15 m below, in 2004), which were also insufficient to prevent debris from falling onto the properties beneath, and the fact that the viaduct was a prohibited route for overweight vehicles, forcing more trucks through the city streets.Frequently Asked Questions (from the project website of Transit New Zealand) Major repair of the structure was considered as an option. However, its structural elements did not lend themselves to easy strengthening, and even a reconditioned viaduct would only have provided an estimated life expectancy of 40-50 more years. With a new structure costing only around 15% more than a repair, and expected to last for over 100 years, it was decided to go for a full replacement.  New structure  The new Transit New Zealand structure was estimated to cost NZ$150 million, and cleared planning hurdles quicker than expected, leading to hopes that it would be possible to build it in time for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Originally, the three-year duration project was expected to start in 2009/2010. Factors that influenced the quick decision process were the lack of any archeological evidence in the construction area, as well as the lack of substantial numbers of residential properties affected by the new structure.Archeological and Heritage Assessment (Russell Foster and Associates, September 2005) = Design = The new structure was to be constructed in a way to minimally affect the traffic flow on this crucial motorway link, by first constructing a new viaduct of four southbound lanes to the north-east of the existing structure, then demolishing the existing three southbound lanes, before constructing the three new northbound lanes in the gap and finally demolishing the three old northbound lanes. It was originally considered whether to build a 'steel box' or a 'concrete box' structure, though both would look similar to the existing viaduct structure.Artist's concept impression of the proposed alignment (from the Transit New Zealand project website) It was eventually decided to construct a segmented structure built from 468 pre-cast concrete sections constructed off-site in East Tamaki, and moved into place with a lifting gantry truss.Newmarket Connection - Viaduct Replacement Newsletter, Issue 01, July 2009, Page 2 Tonkin + Taylor and URS New Zealand, as part of the Northern Gateway Alliance, were assigned to develop the new bridge, and one of their design targets included full recycling of all material during the project. The consultant team was also to use the experience gained at the Waiwera Viaduct in this new project. However, estimated costs in June 2008 had risen to NZ$187 million, and it was unclear whether the funds would be made accessible quickly enough to achieve the ambitious schedule of finishing the bridge in time for the 2011 World Cup. In October 2008, funding was confirmed, but the estimated price later increased to NZ$195 million, with rising prices for fuel, construction materials and labour cited as the reasons. While still ahead of schedule, only part of the viaduct replacement was completed in time for the Rugby World cup in 2011. The new viaduct features better noise protection for the surrounding communities, thanks to noise-absorbing asphalt, solid concrete crash barriers, and partial noise walls. Some further urban design improvements were also part of the project, such as a volcanic-themed walkway from Gillies Avenue down towards Newmarket (connecting to Clovernook Road).An urban design-integrated approach - Newmarket Connection, Viaduct Replacement Newsletter - NZ Transport Agency, Issue 02, October 2009, Page 3 One of the first new columns mostly finished in mid-2009. The 'Big Blue' gantry crane working on the new viaduct section in 2010. = Construction = Construction began in earnest in April 2007, with the first foundations for the up to 18m high piers of the southbound part of the new viaduct. A bracing structure under the section carrying over the railway line was established over Easter 2009, and a 140m long, 800 ton heavy launching gantry was erected above the Newmarket skyline, which moved into place new sections and stabilised parts to be demolished (with the demolition considered the most difficult part of the project). The southbound addition was to be finished by the end of 2010, while the northbound section was expected to take at least until March 2012. During construction, sight screens reduced visual distractions of passing drivers, though the construction still required narrowing of the traffic lanes and reduction of the maximum speed on the viaduct to 70 km/h. A number of temporary support girders around the structure were also required to safely cater for the stresses put on the structure while parts of it were demolished and rebuilt. Construction involved building the new southbound viaduct first, then demolition of the old southbound viaduct, followed by the construction of the new northbound section in the resulting gap, before the old northbound section was finally demolished. This ensured that except for short interruptions, normal motorway capacity would remain available throughout the construction period. Further work also took place around the viaduct, including the construction of a volcanic-themed walkway from Gillies Avenue to Broadway (via Clovernook Road) and an upgraded footbridge over State Highway 1 at Mt Hobson Road. The new viaduct is composed of 468 separate bridge deck sections, produced in a precast facility in East Tamaki.High, wide and ever so handsome - Newmarket Connection, Viaduct Replacement Newsletter - NZ Transport Agency, Issue 02, October 2009, Page 1 Over 150 people were employed directly by the project. = Awards = The work on demolishing the old viaduct sections while the new sections were constructed directly adjacent won the Civils Demolition Award in the 2012 World Demolition Awards.

He was known for his anthropological research in China, Taiwan, Korea, Russia, Europe, etc. His research took him all over East Asia and South America. Torii first made use of a camera while conducting field-work in Northeastern China in 1895. In 1900, Torii was assisted in his research by interpreter Ushinosuke Mori. Described as \\"a pioneer in the use of the camera in anthropological field- work\\", Torii inspired other researchers, including Mori, to make use of photographs. Torii's Memorial Museum established by Tokushima Prefecture (Âæ≥Â≥∂ÁúåÁ´ãÈ≥•Â±ÖË®òÂøµÂçöÁâ©È§®). Early life Torii was born on the island of Shikoku, in the Tokushima quarter of Higashi Senba-ch≈ç (Êù±ËàπÂ†¥Áî∫), into a merchant family. From an early age, he was a passionate collector of artifacts of all kinds, though he generally showed little interest in schoolwork. For a time he abandoned school, until the guidance of an understanding teacher (Tominaga Ikutar≈ç:ÂØåÊ∞∏ÂπæÂ§™ÈÉé)Torii Ry≈´z≈ç Zensh≈´, Asahi Shinbunsha, Tokyo, Vol.12 1977 p.24. convinced him to complete his schooling. One of his hobbies was local history, and he pursued research on his home region.Torii Ry≈´z≈ç Zensh≈´, Asahi Shinbunsha, Tokyo 1975 vol.1 pp.1-12. In his teens, he had already begun writing articles on anthropological topics. These came to the attention and appreciation of Tokyo Imperial University (TIU) professor of anthropology Tsuboi Sh≈çgor≈ç (Âù™‰∫ïÊ≠£‰∫îÈÉé). Sh≈çgor≈ç took an interest in the young Torii, and hurried to Tokushima, to advise Torii to study anthropology. Acting on Sh≈çgor≈ç's advice, Torii moved to Tokyo at age 20.\\"Memo of an Old Student\\" (Torii Ry≈´z≈ç, „ÅÇ„ÇãËÄÅÂ≠¶Âæí„ÅÆÊâãË®ò  Career  He made an early reputation with his work on the native Ainu people of the Kuril Islands. Torii used eight different languages in his studies, and could use Ainu language. His article \\"Ainu people in Chishima Island\\", written in French, is a landmark in Ainu studies. Torii spent almost all of his life in anthropology field-work (research). He insisted that: \\"Studies should not be done only in the study room. Anthropology is in the fields and mountains.\\" He insisted that anthropological theories should be backed by strong empirical evidence.„ÄéLife of Ryuzo Torii„Äèby Torii Ryuzo Memorial Museum Torii began to use sound recording in anthropology research in domestic research at Okinawa Prefecture. Torii is famous for research performed outside of Japan, but he started in Japan, from his hometown to almost everywhere in that country from Hokkaido to Okinawa. During his time at TIU, he studied Japan, on the invitation of various prefectures, villages, streets, etc. After completing his research in an area, he always held an exhibition, lecturing and showing discoveries. The Torii style is research, exhibit and lecture.\\"Achievements of Ryuzo Torii\\" by Tadashi Saito In 1898 he became an assistant at TIU. In 1895, TIU sent Torii to Northeast China to the Liaodong Peninsula, his first overseas posting. In 1896, the University sent Torii to Taiwan.\\"Life of Ryuzo Torii\\", \\"Exhibitin\\" by Torii's Memorial Museum He was posted in 1896 to Taiwan. In 1899 he worked in Hokkaido and Chishima Island, to study the Ainu people, yielding a 1903 book Chishima Ainu, on the Kuril Ainu. In 1900 he completed the first ascent of Taiwan's \\"Yu-mountain\\" (at the time, \\"Shin Taka-mountain\\"). In 1905 he became a TIU lecturer. In 1906 he was engaged by the Karachin Royal Family of Mongolia. Kimiko worked as a teacher at Karachin Girl-School. Torii became a professor of Karachin Boy-School. In 1911 Torii conducted field-work in Korea. At the time Sada Sekino described an ancient tomb as a Goguryeo artifact. Torii pointed out that it instead belonged to Han dynasty. This cost him friends, since Sekino was a powerful figure at TIU. Torii proved that the Han Chinese had arrived in Korea at an early period.\\"Ryuzo Torii' s achievement\\" by Tadashi Saito In 1921 Torii earned a PhD in anthropology from TIU. In 1922 Torii became an Assistant Professor at TIU. In 1924 Torii left TIU and established Ryuzo Torii Institute, staffed by his family members. In 1928 Torii worked on establishing Sophia University in Tokyo. It was the only foreign school there for many years. As a Catholic anthropologist, Torii worked hard: he did all procedures for Ryuzo Torii and succeeded in lifting it up to a university level. It is a great achievement of Torii in internationalizing Japanese universities.\\"Studies on Ryuzo Torii No. 1\\" In 1937 he traveled to Brazil and carried out excavations at the sambaqui archeological site Morro do Bernardes, Jupuvura, municipality of Iguape, S√£o Paulo - with support from the Museu Paulista and the botanist Frederico Lange de Morretes. In 1939 he joined the Harvard‚ÄìYenching Institute, the top Institute for Asian studies in the US at the time as an \\"Invited Professor\\". A sister university of Harvard was named Yenching University in Peking, China, and was an American missionary school. The Japanese Army could not come into this University until the Pearl Harbor attack. Torii was sent to this American area in China by the Institute, where his China anthropology studies reside, during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\\"Life of Ryuzo Torii\\" by Torii's Memorial Museum On 6 December 1951, Torii and his family returned to Tokyo, Japan. They arrived at Yokohama on a ship from Tientsin, China.  Recognition  In 1920 Torii was honored for an Ordre des Palmes Academiquesiques of France. The award disappeared within the university. In 1964 the \\"Torii' Memorial Museum\\" was established by Tokushima prefecture, at Naruto area. It is in a Japanese traditional castle on the top of Myoken Mountain. Funds came from local people, showing their memory and love for Ryuzo Torii. In 2010 the Museum moved to Tokushima city in the \\"Forest of Culture\\" area.  Personal life  In 1901 he married Kimiko, daughter of a famous samurai in Tokushima. She was talented in music, language and education. In the wake of Yoshino Sakuz≈ç's criticism of Japan's Imperial ambitions in Korea, Torii aligned himself with those who justified Japanese annexation on the grounds that the contemporary consensus worldwide in linguistics, anthropology and archaeology was that the Korean and Japanese people were one and the same 'race/people' (d≈çminzoku).

In 1939, the total area of Polish territories occupied by the Soviet Union (including the area given to Lithuania and annexed in 1940 during the formation of Lithuanian SSR), was 201,015 square kilometres, with a population of 13.299 million, of which 5.274 million were ethnic Poles and 1.109 million were Jews.Concise Statistical Year-Book of Poland, Polish Ministry of Information.

Baltic states (1940‚Äì1991) After existing as independent countries for twenty years, the Baltic states were occupied and illegally annexed in June 1940.Anu Mai Koll, \\"Baltic Countries Under Occupation: Soviet & Nazi Rule 1939‚Äì1991\\", Given a free hand by Nazi Germany via the German‚ÄìSoviet Nonaggression Pact and its secret additional protocol of August 1939, the Soviet Union pressured the three countries to accept its military bases in September 1939. In the case of refusal, the USSR effected an air and naval blockade and threatened to attack immediately with hundreds of thousands of troops massed upon the border. The military forces overtook the political systems of these countries and installed puppet regimes after rigged elections in June 1940.\\"Phase III: The Soviet Occupation of Estonia from 1944\\". In: Estonia since 1944: Reports of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity, pp. VII‚ÄìXXVI. Tallinn, 2009 The sovietisation was interrupted by the German occupation in 1941‚Äì1944. The Baltic Offensive re-established the Soviet control in 1944‚Äì1945, and resumed sovietisation, mostly completed by 1950. The forced collectivisation of agriculture began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation in March 1949. Private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. An armed resistance movement of 'forest brothers' was active until the mid-1950s. Hundreds of thousands participated or supported the movement; tens of thousands were killed. The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers also suffered hundreds of deaths. Some innocent civilians were killed on both sides. In addition, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953; from 1956‚Äì58, a large part of the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return. During the occupation, the Soviet authorities killed, politically arrested, unlawfully drafted, and deported hundreds of thousands of people. Numerous other kind of crimes against humanity were committed all through the occupation period. Furthermore, trying to enforce the ideals of Communism, the authorities deliberately dismantled the existing social and economic structures, and imposed new \\"ideologically pure\\" hierarchies. This severely retarded the Baltic economies. For example, Estonian scientists have estimated economic damages directly attributable to the post-World War II occupation to hundreds of billions of US dollars (several dozens worth of Estonia's 2006 GDP of $21.28 billion). The Soviet environmental damage to Estonia is estimated to about $4 billion. In addition to direct damages, the retarded economy led to severe inequality within the Northern Europe. After all, the attempt to integrate the Estonian society into the Soviet system failed. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet. This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s, regain their independence in 1991, and then rapidly develop a modern society. Notwithstanding the annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940, it is therefore correct to speak of the occupation of the Baltic states, referring in particular to the absence of Soviet legal title. The prolonged occupation was an unorthodox one. Until 1991, the status of the three countries resembled the classical occupation in important ways: external control by an internationally unsanctioned force and a conflict of interest between the foreign power and the inhabitants. However, in other aspects the situation was very different from a classical occupation. Both the fact of the incorporation of the Baltic states to the USSR as Soviet republics without qualification, and the long duration of the Soviet rule challenge the applicability of all rules on occupation from the practical point of view. Despite the fact of annexation, the presence of the USSR in the Baltic states remained an occupation sui generis.

The Soviet Union demanded to move the Finnish border further away from Leningrad. The USSR also insisted that Finland lease the Hanko Peninsula (or similar territory at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland) for the creation of a Red Baltic Fleet naval base.D. W. Spring. 'The Soviet Decision for War against Finland, 30 November 1939'. Soviet Studies, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Apr. 1986), pp. 207‚Äì226 However, Finland refused and the Soviet Union invaded the country, initiating the Winter War. The USSR set up the Finnish Democratic Republic (), a short-lived Soviet puppet regime in the occupied Karelian territories. The Soviets also occupied the Petsamo municipality in the Barents Sea coast during the war. The Moscow Peace Treaty ended the state of occupation on 12 March 1940, as Finland was forced to cede parts of Karelia. The land accounted for 9% of the country's territory, included Finland's second largest city Viipuri and much of Finland's industry. About 422,000 Karelians ‚Äî 12% of Finland's population ‚Äî choose rather to evacuate beyond the new border and lose their homes than to become Soviet subjects. The military troops and the remaining civilians were hastily evacuated. Finland also had to cede a part of the Salla area, the Rybachy Peninsula in the Barents Sea and four islands in the Gulf of Finland. The ceded areas were integrated within the Karelian ASSR to form the Karelo- Finnish SSR. When the hostilities resumed in 1941, Finnish forces retook the lost areas and then advanced further up to the Svir River and Lake Onega before the end of the year. In the Soviet offensive of 1944 against the Finns the Red Army advance was halted by the Finns before reaching the 1940 border or, in the sole case where it did happen, the Red Army was promptly thrown back in Finnish counterattack. In the negotiations that followed the stopping of the Soviet offensive Finns further ceded the Petsamo municipality to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Armistice. The Soviet forces took the municipality from the Germans during the Petsamo‚ÄìKirkenes Offensive. Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (1940) The Soviet Union, which did not recognize the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia since the union of 1918, issued an ultimatum on 28 June 1940 demanding the evacuation of the Romanian military and administration from the territory it contested as well as from the northern part of the Romanian province of Bukovina. Under pressure from Moscow and Berlin, the Romanian administration and armed forces retreated to avoid war. Adolf Hitler used Soviet occupation of Bessarabia as justification for German occupation of Yugoslavia and Greece and German attack on USSR. After the Soviet Union entered the war on the Allied side Map of the Eastern Bloc On 22 June 1941, the Operation Barbarossa commenced, which gave a start of the Eastern front. German lead European Axis countries and Finland invaded the USSR, thereby terminating the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. During the hostilities between the Soviet Union and the Axis, which led to the total military defeat of the latter, the USSR fully or partially occupied the territory of Germany and its satellites, as well as the territories of some Germany occupied states and Austria. Some of them became Soviet Satellite states, namely, the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Republic of Hungary,Granville, Johanna, The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956, Texas A&M; University Press, 2004. the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Albania; later, East Germany was formed based on the Soviet zone of German occupation. = Iran (1941‚Äì1946)= On 25 August 1941 British and Commonwealth forces and the Soviet Union jointly invaded Iran. The purpose of the invasion (codenamed Operation Countenance) was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure supply lines (see Persian Corridor) for the Soviets fighting against European Axis countries on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union would go on to set up the Azerbaijan People's Government in Iranian Azerbaijan while just occupying the rest of north Iran. = Hungary (1944)= In July 1941, the Kingdom of Hungary, a member of the Tripartite Pact, took part in Operation Barbarossa, in alliance with Nazi Germany. Hungarian forces fought shoulder to shoulder with the Wehrmacht and advanced through the Ukrainian SSR deep into Russia, all the way to Stalingrad. However, by the end of 1942 the Soviet Red Army began pushing back the Wehrmacht through a series of offensives that preceded the Red Army's encroachment upon Hungarian territory in 1943‚Äì44. In September 1944 Soviet forces crossed into Hungary, launching the Budapest Offensive. As the Hungarian army ignored the armistice with the USSR signed by the government of Mikl√≥s Horthy on 15 October 1944, the Soviets fought their way further westward against the Hungarian troops and their German allies capturing the capital on 13 February 1945. Operations continued until early April 1945, when the last German forces and their remaining loyal Hungarian troops were routed out of the country. The Soviets made sure that a loyal post-war government dominated by Communists was installed in the country before transferring authority from the occupational force to the Hungarian authorities. The presence of Soviet troops in the country was regulated by the 1949 mutual assistance treaty concluded between the Soviet and Hungarian governments. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was a spontaneous nationwide revolt against the Communist government of Hungary and its Soviet-imposed policies. After announcing a willingness to negotiate the withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Soviet Politburo changed its mind. On 4 November 1956, a large joint military force of the Warsaw Pact led by Moscow, entered Budapest to crush the armed resistance, killing thousands of civilians in the process. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the last Soviet soldier left the country in 1991, thus ending Soviet military presence in Hungary. = Romania (1944)= Map of Romania after World War II indicating lost territories. The Soviet's second Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive led to defeat of Romania, subsequent coup d'√©tat, and the switch of Romania from the Axis to the Allies. The Soviet troops were stationed in this country from 1944 and 1958.Sergiu Verona, \\"Military Occupation and Diplomacy: Soviet Troops in Romania, 1944‚Äì1958\\", On 12 September 1944, with the Red Army already controlling much of Romania's territory, an Armistice Agreement between Romania and the USSR was signed, under which Romania retroceded the territory it administered earlier in the war, and subjected itself to an allied commission consisting of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. On the ground, it was the Soviet military command, and not the Western allies, that de facto exercised dominant authority. The presence and free movement of Soviet troops was explicitly stipulated in the agreement. The terms of the Armistice Agreement ceased on 15 September 1947 as the conditions of the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947 entered into force. The new treaty stipulated the withdrawal of all Allied forces from Romania with an important exemption that such withdrawal was \\"subject to the right of the Soviet Union to keep on Romanian territory such armed forces as it may need for the maintenance of the lines of communication of the Soviet Army with the Soviet zone of occupation in Austria.\\" In the aftermath of the agreement the Soviet presence fell from 130,000 troops (the peak in 1947) to approximately 30,000. The troops were fully withdrawn by August 1958. Comparing the Soviet occupation of Romania to that of Bulgaria, David Stone notes: \\"Unlike Bulgaria, Romania had few cultural and historical ties with Russia, and had actually waged war on the Soviet Union. As a result, Soviet occupation weighted heavier on the Romanian people, and the troops themselves were less disciplined.\\"David Stone, \\"The 1945 Ethridge Mission to Bulgaria and Romania and the Origins of the Cold War in the Balkans\\", Diplomacy & Statecraft, Volume 17, no. 1, March 2006, pp. 93‚Äì112. =Bulgaria (1944)= On 5 September 1944, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and on 8 September invaded the country, without encountering resistance. By the next day Soviets occupied the northeastern part of Bulgaria along with the key port city of Varna. On 8 September 1944 Bulgaria declared war against Nazi Germany. Garrison detachments with Zveno officers at the head overthrew the government on the eve of 9 September, after taking strategic keypoints in Sofia and arresting the ministers. A new government of the Fatherland Front was appointed on 9 September with Kimon Georgiev as prime minister. Soviet troops were withdrawn in 1947. = Czechoslovakia (1944)= In the fall of 1944 when the north and eastern parts of Carpathian Ruthenia were captured by the Red Army, the Czechoslovak government delegation led by minister arrived in Khust to establish the provisional Czechoslovak administration, according to the treaties between the Soviet and Czechoslovak governments from the same year. However, after a few weeks, the Red Army and NKVD started to obstruct the delegation's work and the \\"National committee of Transcarpatho-Ukraine\\" was set up in Mukachevo under the protection of the Red Army. On 26 November this committee, led by Ivan Turyanytsia (a Rusyn who deserted from the Czechoslovak army) proclaimed the will of Ukrainian people to separate from Czechoslovakia and join the Soviet Ukraine. After two months of conflicts and negotiations the Czechoslovak government delegation departed from Khust on 1 February 1945, leaving the Carpathian Ukraine under Soviet control. After World War II, on 29 June 1945, a treaty was signed between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, ceding Carpatho-Ukraine officially to the Soviet Union. Following the capture of Prague by the Red Army in May 1945 the Soviets withdrew in December 1945 as part of an agreement that all Soviet and US troops leave the country. =Northern Norway (1944‚Äì1946) and Bornholm, Denmark (1945‚Äì1946)= In 1944‚Äì1946, Soviet troops occupied northern Norway and the Danish island of Bornholm, strategically situated at the Baltic sea entrance. Stalin's intent was to attempt to gain bases at these locations late in the war. The Soviet deputy ambassador suggested seizing Bornholm in March 1945 and on 4 May the Baltic Fleet was ordered to seize the island. Bornholm was heavily bombarded by Soviet forces in May 1945. Gerhard von Kamptz, the German superior officer in charge failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, several Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in R√∏nne and Nex√∏ and seriously damaged roughly 3000 more during 7‚Äì8 May 1945. On 9 May, Soviet troops landed on the island and after a short fight the German garrison did surrender. Soviet forces left the island on 5 April 1946. = Germany (1945)= Soviet occupation zone of Germany was the area of eastern Germany occupied by the Soviet Union from 1945 on. In 1949 it became The German Democratic Republic known in English as East Germany. In 1955 the Republic was declared by the Soviet Union to be fully sovereign; however, Soviet troops remained, based on the four-power Potsdam agreement. As NATO troops remained in West Berlin and West Germany, the GDR and Berlin in particular became focal points of Cold War tensions. A separation barrier between West and East Germany, the Berlin Wall known in the Soviet Union and in East Germany as the \\"Anti-Fascist Protective Rampart,\\" was built in 1961. The Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany signed in Moscow, mandated the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Germany by the end of 1994. Conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for unification of East and West Germany. Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990. One result of the occupation was children fathered by Russian soldiers either through romantic relationships, relationships of convenience or rape. These children experienced societal discrimination for decades, but after the troops' withdrawal and the development of perestroika, some of these \\"Lost Red Army Children\\" made public attempts to discover more about their Russian fathers. =Austria (1945‚Äì1955)= Occupation zones in Austria The Soviet occupation of Austria lasted from 1945 to 1955. At the end of the war, Austria and Vienna were divided into 4 zones of occupation, following the terms of the Potsdam Conference. The Soviet Union expropriated over 450 businesses, formerly German-owned, and established Administration for Soviet Property in Austria, or USIA. This accounted for less than 10% of the Austrian workforce at the peak in 1951, and less than 5% of the Austrian GDP at that time. On 15 May 1955, the Austrian State Treaty was signed, officially establishing Austrian independence and sovereignty. The treaty was enacted on 27 July, and the last Allied troops left the country on 25 October. = Manchuria (1945‚Äì1946)= The Soviet invasion of Manchuria, or the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation (, lit. Manchzhurskaya Strategicheskaya Nastupatelnaya Operaciya) as the Soviet named it, began on 9 August 1945 with the Soviet invasion of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and was the largest campaign of the 1945 Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War which resumed hostilities between Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan after more than 4 years of peace. Soviets gains on the continent were Manchukuo, Mengjiang (Inner Mongolia) and northern Korean Peninsula. The rapid defeat of Japan's Kwantung Army was a very significant factor in the Japanese surrender and the end of World War II, as Japan realized the Russians were willing and able to take the cost of invasion of its Home Islands, after their rapid conquest of Manchuria and southern Sakhalin.\\"Battlefield ‚Äì Manchuria ‚Äì The Forgotten Victory\\", Battlefield (documentary series), 2001, 98 minutes.Robert Butow, Japan's Decision to Surrender, Stanford University Press, 1954 .Richard B.

Provisional committees were set up across the country putting Communists into key positions. In February 1946 a provisional government called the North Korean Provisional People's Committee was formed under Kim Il-sung. Soviet forces departed in 1948, and a few years later, in an attempt to unite Korea under Communist rule, the Korean War broke out. =Kuril Islands (1945)= After Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration on 14 August 1945, and announced the termination of the war on 15 August 1945, the Soviet Union started the Invasion of the Kuril Islands, which took place between 18 August and 3 September, expelling the Japanese inhabitants two years laterK. Takahara, Nemuro raid survivor longs for homeland. Japan Times, 22 September 2007. Accessed 3 August 2008 Cold War =Hungarian Revolution of 1956= The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was a spontaneous nationwide revolt against the Communist government of Hungary and its Soviet-imposed policies. After announcing their willingness to negotiate the withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Soviet Politburo changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution. On 4 November 1956, a large joint military force of the Warsaw Pact, led by Moscow, entered Budapest to crush the armed resistance. The Soviet intervention, codenamed \\"Operation Whirlwind\\", was launched by Marshal Ivan Konev.UN General Assembly Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary (1957) The five Soviet divisions stationed in Hungary before 23 October were augmented to a total strength of 17 divisions. The 8th Mechanized Army under command of Lieutenant General Hamazasp Babadzhanian and the 38th Army under command of Lieutenant General Hadzhi-Umar Mamsurov from the nearby Carpathian Military District were deployed to Hungary for the operation. At 3:00 a.m. on 4 November, Soviet tanks penetrated Budapest along the Pest side of the Danube in two thrusts‚Äîone from the south, and one from the north‚Äîthus splitting the city in half. Armored units crossed into Buda, and at 4:25 a.m. fired the first shots at the army barracks on Buda√µrsi road. Soon after, Soviet artillery and tank fire was heard in all districts of Budapest. Operation Whirlwind combined air strikes, artillery, and the coordinated tank-infantry action of 17 divisions. By 8:00 am organised defence of the city evaporated after the radio station was seized, and many defenders fell back to fortified positions. Hungarian civilians bore the brunt of the fighting, and it was often impossible for Soviet troops to differentiate military from civilian targets. For this reason, Soviet tanks often crept along main roads firing indiscriminately into buildings. Hungarian resistance was strongest in the industrial areas of Budapest, which were heavily targeted by Soviet artillery and air strikes. The last pocket of resistance called for ceasefire on 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 722 Soviet troops had been killed and thousands more were wounded.Mark Kramer, \\"The Soviet Union and the 1956 Crises in Hungary and Poland: Reassessments and New Findings\\", Journal of Contemporary History, Vol.33, No.2, April 1998, p.210.P√©ter Gosztonyi, \\"Az 1956-os forradalom sz√°mokban\\", N√©pszabads√°g (Budapest), 3 November 1990. =Czechoslovakia (1968‚Äì1989)= In 1948, the Czech Communist Party won a large portion of the vote in Czechoslovak politics, leading to a communist period without immediate Soviet military presence. The 1950s were characterized as a repressive period in the country's history, but by the 1960s, the local socialist leadership had taken a course toward economic, social and political reforms. However, a number of significant Czech communists, together with the Czech security agency, conspired against limited introduction of market systems, personal freedoms, and renewal of civic associations (see Socialism with a human face) by leveraging Russian support towards strengthening Communist Party's positions. Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, reacted to these reforms by announcing the Brezhnev Doctrine, and on 21 August 1968, about 750,000 Warsaw Pact troops, mostly from the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary, with tanks and machine guns occupied Czechoslovakia, deported thousands of people and rapidly derailed all reforms. Most large cities were individually invaded and overtaken; however, the invasion's primary attention focused on Prague, particularly the state organs, Czech television and radio. The Czechoslovak government held an emergency session, and loudly expressed its disagreement with the occupation. Many citizens joined in protests, and by September 1968 at least 72 people had died and hundreds more injured in the conflicts. In the brief time after the occupation, which had put an end to any hope that Prague Spring had created, about 100,000 people fled Czechoslovakia. Over the whole time of the occupation, more than 700,000 people, including significant part of Czechoslovak intelligentsia left. Communists responded by revoking Czechoslovakian citizenship of many of these refugees and banned them from returning to their homeland. At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Yakov Malik, Soviet ambassador to the United Nations issued a proclamation, claiming that the military intervention was a response to a request by the government of Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union being a permanent member of the Security Councilwith the right to vetowas able to circumvent any United Nations' resolutions to end the occupation. Prague Spring's end became clear by December 1968, when a new presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia accepted the so-called Instructions from The Critical Development in the Country and Society after the XIII Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Under a guise of \\"normalisation\\", all aspects of neo-Stalinism were returned to everyday political and economic life. In 1987, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika owed a great deal to Dubƒçek's socialism with a human face. When asked what the difference was between the Prague Spring and his own reforms, Gorbachev replied, \\"Nineteen years\\". Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia ended in 1989 by the Velvet Revolution, 2 years before the collapse of Soviet Union. The last occupation troops left the country on 27 June 1991 During a visit to Prague in 2007, Vladimir Putin said that he felt the moral responsibility for the 1968 events and that Russia condemned them.Gazeta, –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –º–æ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—É—é –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∑–∞ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è 1968 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –≤ –ß–µ—Ö–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∞–∫–∏–∏ (Putin feels moral responsibility for the 1968 events in Czechoslovakia), 27 April 2007 =Afghanistan (1979‚Äì1989)= The Soviet invasion in late December 1979. Scholarly and historical accounts maintained that Afghanistan had been under the Soviet Union's influence as early as 1919 when Afghanistan began receiving aid to counter the Anglosphere of the United Kingdom. Major Soviet technical assistance, military aid, and economic relations grew in the 1950s followed by the Communist Revolution in the 1970s. With the threat to the Afghan communist government, the government invited the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan which began as midnight approached on 24 December 1979. The USSR organized a massive military airlift into Kabul, involving an estimated 280 transport aircraft and 3 divisions of almost 8,500 men each. Within two days, the Soviet Union had seized control of Afghanistan, first securing Kabul by deploying a special Soviet assault unit against Darulaman Palace, where elements of the Afghan army loyal to Hafizullah Amin put up a fierce, but brief resistance. With Amin's death at the palace, Babrak Karmal, exiled leader of the Parcham faction of the PDPA was installed by the Soviets as Afghanistan's new head of government.John Fullerton, \\"The Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan\\", The peak of the fighting came in 1985‚Äì86. The Soviet forces launched their largest and most effective assaults on the mujahedin supply lines adjacent to Pakistan. Major campaigns had also forced the mujahedin into the defensive near Herat and Kandahar. On 15 February 1989, the last Soviet troops departed on schedule from Afghanistan.

With a population of roughly 16,600, it is the largest village in and the capital of the municipality of Loon op Zand, which also consists of the villages of De Moer and Loon op Zand. As Kaatsheuvel is a municipality capital, it has a town hall, located in the town centre. The town hall was torn down in 2010 as part of an ambitious plan to build a lively new town centre. A new town centre has been built, with the title Bruisend Dorpshart (Sparkling Village's Heart). Kaatsheuvel is internationally known for the Efteling theme park and as a gateway to National Park Loonse en Drunense Duinen.  History  = 13th and 14th century: Duke of Brabant and Lord of Venloon = The Netherlands traditionally consisted of seven provinces. The current province of North Brabant, in which Kaatsheuvel is located, used to be a stand-alone Duchy. The Duchy consisted of a large area with the most important cities: Brussels, 's-Hertogenbosch, Antwerp, Breda, Leuven and Maastricht. Under the leadership of the Duke and his counts, these large cities were supplied by the countryside. Although the oldest source speaks of 'Kaatsheuvel' dating from the 14th century, Venloon, the country now known as Loon op Zand, Kaatsheuvel and De Moer was already mentioned in the year 1233. In 1269 \\"the village of Venloon with its moors, nuts and wild lands\\" was loaned by Jan I van Brabant to Willem van Horne. This gave Venloon its first landlord and \\"fiefdom Venloon\\" was born. = 14th century: Peat cutters = A Peat-cutter In the 14th century there was an economic growth in Heerlijkheid Venloon. The peat soil turned out to be very suitable for peat extraction. Peat was a type of soil that could serve as a fuel to heat houses. The habitable area of Venloon grew further and further, creating different communities. That is also how the Kaatsheuvel community came into being. The main task of the inhabitants was peat stabbing. This meant that the peat soil had to be pulled out of the soil, dried, processed and transported. = 15th century: Farmers and hunters = Windmill The Couwenbergh The Old Firestation National Park Loonse en Drunense Duinen House in the centre Castle of Lord of Venloon, nearby Kaatsheuvel In the 15th century, most of the peat land was silted up. This ensured that the income from peat extraction was considerably reduced. Many Kaatsheuvel citizens therefore took the initiative to secure their first life needs. They already owned a nice piece of land, so with a small amount of cattle they could provide for their own necessities. Agriculture was fairly primitive, which meant that the agricultural land was used only once. The woody area was also very suitable as a hunting ground, which made hunting a source of income. = 17th and 18th century: Shelter churches and robber gangs = The 80-year war came to an end on 15 May 1648 with the Peace of Munster. The peace between Spain and the Republic of the United Provinces led to a division of Brabant. The south of the duchy belonged to the Spanish Netherlands, while the north, Staats-Brabant, became part of the Republic of the United Netherlands. State Brabant was a so-called \\"Generality Country\\", unlike other areas, State Brabant was not recognized as an equivalent province of the Republic and therefore did not get its own government. During this period, the whole of Brabant was systematically stripped of money by the Republic, so that there was hardly any economic development. The Republic wanted to turn Brabant into a Protestant province before it was recognized for the time being. The people from Brabant, however, saw all the merits go to Holland, so that they had little sympathy for the States General. The population secretly continued to practice the Catholic faith by converting barns into hiding churches. The Kaatsheuvel community had no church of its own at the time and had to go to the shelter church in the White Castle in Loon op Zand. Kaatsheuvel was located in the border region of Holland and Staats-Brabant. Around 1720, this brought a fairly large gang of pagans to this area, which in part consisted of marshes and forests. From the Ravenbosch near Kaatsheuvel, the robber gang \\"de Witte Veer\\" operated. This gang regularly undertook raids far into the republic of Holland. The robbers took advantage of the disagreements between State Brabant and Holland. If they had planned a robbery in Holland, they would not cooperate in Brabant, and vice versa. The deputy governor of Loon op Zand, Otto Juijn, was a sustainer and in 1725 he succeeded in capturing the leader of the gang called Black John. In 1795, the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands was overthrown and the Batavian Republic, a French sister republic, recognized the Catholics as equal citizens. The State Brabant became a province in 1795, with the name Batavian Brabant = 19th century: Leather and shoe industry = Apprentice shoemaker The Batavian Republic was abolished and the Kingdom of Holland was founded in 1806. The provinces of North Brabant, Antwerp and South Brabant were added to the kingdom, although this was for a short period. The economy in North Brabant had grown enormously in the short time. With the addition of Antwerp and South Brabant, North Brabant had become at the center of the kingdom. The Belgian uprising, however, again caused a division of Brabant. Antwerp and South Brabant became part of the independent country \\"Belgium\\". The province of Noord-Brabant, which had never really taken sides, eventually remained part of the Netherlands. In the Brabant region, De Langstraat, especially in Kaatsheuvel and Waalwijk, a smooth-running leather and shoe industry developed. Many citizens work in factories or were independent dealers in leather goods and shoes. = 20th century: Tourism and kitchens = By pastor F.J. the Klijn and the curate E. Rietra, plans are made for a recreational field in Kaatsheuvel. In the spring of 1935, the Roman Catholic Sports and Hiking Park is opened. This recreational field developed after the Second World War (1952) into a theme park Efteling. The theme park provided local employment and recreation. Eventually, Efteling has become one of the largest and most successful theme parks in the world. The park has won many prizes over the years, including \\"best leisure park in Europe\\" in 1972 and \\"best amusement park in the world\\" in 1992. The Efteling gained worldwide fame through the Fairytale Forest, which was largely designed by the famous Dutch artist Anton Pieck. The first madhouse in the world \\"Villa Volta\\", water show \\"Aquanura\\" and darkride \\"Symbolica\\" have won international Thea Awards. With 5,3 million visitors on an annual basis, Efteling is the most visited attraction park in the Netherlands. Ben Mandemakers started selling kitchens in Kaatsheuvel in 1978. In the meantime, DMG has become the largest empire for kitchens in the Netherlands with more than 17 store formulas. Various showrooms are located in Kaatsheuvel itself.  Etymology  Kaatsheuvel is a combination of the words Kaats and Heuvel, Heuvel being the Dutch word for \\"hill\\". The etymology of Kaats is less clear. One theory regarding the origin of the name is that it originates from St. Catharina, a popular saint at the time. Another theory holds that the early inhabitants of Kaatsheuvel were well known for playing a game called kaatsspel on a hill nearby. However, the most likely explanation is that a man named Hendrik Cets lived in the 17th century on a hill where Kaatsheuvel now stands, and over time this place came to be known as Cetsheuvel, and eventually Kaatsheuvel.  Art and Culture  * The village of Kaatsheuvel is located in the area 'De Langstraat' which is traditionally known for its shoe industry. The Shoe and Leather Museum in the nearby city of Waalwijk shows the history of the region. * The village also has several stages where music and theater performances are played. Crossroads Kaatsheuvel, Gildebont, Theater Klavier and the Efteling Theater. * Every year several music and cultural festivals are organized, including the Dance Fairytale Festival, Anton Pieck Food Truck Festival and Square Festival in the summer season and The illuminated Sinterklaas entry and Carnival procession in the winter season.  Delicacies  Although the Netherlands is a small country, it has various regions with their own culture and delicacies. Overproduction of regional foods was often used for these delicacies. There was a lot of fishing along the coast, which meant that fish dishes appeared on a regular basis. In the province of Noord-Brabant, in particular in the Langstraat region, was a thriving leather industry. This meant that many farmers were needed. The leather was used for shoes, but the meat was used in various dishes. The Brabantian Worstenbrood, or Sausageroll is an example of a typical regional product that originated from cattle farming in North Brabant. The puff pastry from the traditional English Sausageroll was too expensive for the inhabitants of the region. Thats why bread dough was used as an alternative. The bread dough also had the advantage that the minced meat was kept longer fresh. A typical Kaatsheuvel dish is the Mikkemannen. They are dolls made from bread dough, in which gingerbread spices and cinnamon are processed. The Mikkemannen are often eaten with butter and sugar. Speculaas was not affordable in the south, making Mikkemannen a cheaper alternative.  Location  Kaatsheuvel is situated near the municipalities of Waalwijk, Heusden and Dongen, in the middle of North-Brabant. It is also close to several bigger cities like Tilburg, known for its textile, Herbal liqueur 'Schrobbeler' and the Big Summer Funfair. 's-Hertogenbosch, the capital of North-Brabant is known for its Art- and Designmuseums, Canals and historical center. and last of all Breda, Nassau-City, known for its historical center and historical links with the Dutch Royal Family.

These spiders are known for their brilliant, shiny Ultra violet light. They are members of the family Salticidae and the genus Cosmophasis. They are commonly spotted on green vegetationLim & Li, 2005. C. umbratica shows extreme dimorphism when viewed under UV light: males reflect UV on all body parts that are displayed during intraspecific interaction, while females and juveniles do not reflect UV at all. It seems that C. umbratica uses this in sexual signaling. A similar phenomenon is found in some butterflies (for example, several species of Colias and Gonepteryx, both of the family Pieridae).  Taxonomy and Naming  = Common Names = The scientific name of this particular spider is Cosmophasis umbratica. These spiders are part of the family Cosmophasis. They share similar characteristics with them, but the C. umbratica have their own special qualities that make them unique in comparison to other spiders. Some common names for this particular spider include Shiny Jumping Spider, Green Iridescent Garden Jumper, and Tropical Ornate Jumping Spider. Taxonomist Eugene Simon proposed the genus Cosmophasis in 1901. There are currently about 59 known species part of the genus. The species has roots in Latin as the term umbra means night shadow. = History = The Cosmophasis umbratica are most commonly found in regions of south and southeast Asia. There are large populations of spiders in India and Sumatra. These spiders are mainly spotted in regions with great exposure to sunlight and are generally found on leaves of plants. Cosophasis umbratica are generally spotted during late mornings and early afternoons.  Description  The female Cosmophasis umbratica has a green cephalothorax and a mixture of the black, white, and brown abdomen. On the other hand, the male Cosmophasis umbratica has white, iridescent markings on the lateral cephalothorax and the dorsal as well as on the femora of all legs. Males also have silver-like lines along the abdomen. Generally speaking, males are bigger and brighter than these female spiders. Both male and female C. umbratica present with sexual dimorphism in both size and color. Their colors will not fade over time as long as it is well preserved. = Measurements = Adult males tend to be anywhere from 5-7 mm in length. They are traditionally green and black, but they have silver-like irredescent markings on their abdominal region. Furthermore, they are known for their long, slender legs that are brightly colored which help them jump from place to place. On the other hand, the adult females are only about 4-5mm in length and are generally a mixture of brown, white, and green. They do not have much iridescent coloration on their bodies and their legs are much shorter in comparison to males.  Behavior  The Cosmophasis umbratica displays dimorphic behavior when under observation with a UV light. The male species delineate Ultraviolet light (<400 nm) on the entire body; however, females do not reflect UV light on parts of the body at all. With that being said, this is a perfect example of sexual signaling. However, besides that, there is not much more information on the role of UV light and how that influences the female in mating preference. The C. umbratica has four main ways of movement: skittering, drumming of palps, bobbing of the abdomen, and lunging. = UV Light = The UV light on males tend to act as a mating call. The levels of ‚Äúglow‚Äù on the male abdomen create varying interest among the females. The females are much more attracted to the glowing males in comparison to the males that have their UV masked. However, the males with the UV light not only attract potential mates but they also attract varying predators in the area. = Web = The C. umbratica do not traditionally spin webs like most other species. On the other hand, due to their extensive eye depth and powerful vision, they have adopted a ‚Äústalk and leap‚Äù strategy. These spiders have even been referred to as the tigers of the spiders. The C. umbratica build nests made of viscid silk for them to rest and retreat into. Their nests look similar to sheets made of silk with tubes on either side. Their nests tend to have wide openings with narrow ‚Äúentry points‚Äù. Both males and females tend to build similar features for their nests; however, females tend to seal their doors much more than males do. = Prey = With their unique UV light, the spiders rely heavily on their vision to hunt. They have a complex visual system that acts as their guidance when it comes to terms of prey. Their eyes can recognize objects that are about 20-30 feet away. They also have another set of eyes that help them detect long-range movement. Their two sets of eyes allow them to escape predators in an efficient manner as well as catch prey in a strategic way. Furthermore, these spiders are known to be nectivorous. They feed off of the sweet nectar of lxora inflorescence. This species feeds off of insects, including flies and crickets. = Life Cycle = After mating, the female C. umbratica holds the sperm until she is ready to produce her eggs. The mother will create an egg sac made of silk that will protect the eggs throughout their development. As the eggs are woven and hidden inside the silk, they stay there until fertilization occurs. The mother will lay anywhere between 2 and 36 eggs. Although some spiders may lay there woven sac in a secure location, the mother C. umbratica carries her sac with her until her egglings hatch in order to protect them. When the eggs are ready to hatch, spiderlings emerge = Reproduction = Males become sexually mature before females. They are on the hunt for a suitable partner earlier on. During male to female interactions, skittering is one of the main ways to attract a female. Females tended to be drawn to the level of excitement the males displayed. Therefore, in the presence of females, males became eager and move their bodies back and forth. As the male attempts to mate with a female, there is a lot of decamping taking place. When a male faces the female and she doesn‚Äôt decamp, then the male will continue to skitter alongside her grabbing her attention. Furthermore, the male will drum and his posture straightens and he flexes his abdomen and displays his UV light. Sometimes, the female will try to gain the male‚Äôs attention. This is done by bending the abdomen and prodding onto the male. There is a game of ‚Äútag‚Äù between the male and female as one tries to grab the attention of the other. The females generally try to avoid the attention of the male for as long as possible before entertaining the male. The coupling time varies between each of the C. umbratica. Almost all couplings end with the females scurrying away. Females will not have just one partner throughout their lifespan. = Consequences of Sexual Dimorphism = The colorful bodily array on the spiders may benefit the males in terms of sexual selection. However, quite contrarily, the males do in fact have pay for it. The UV reflecting individuals can be easily spotted by predators. The level of attraction may increase potential mating options but it also increases the rate at which there are predators. The predators notice the glow that is embedded in the bodies of the males and if a predator were to have good eye sight, they‚Äôre able to spot the UV light from great lengths away. = Male to Male Interaction = Most often times than not, when two males interact with one another, it usually involves a fight of some sort. These interactions usually behin when the spiders about 10-15 cm away from the other. They each separately raise their bodies, have their legs hunched, and they bend their abdomens facing one another. The C. umbertica start slowly coming towards one another and their palps begin to vibrate. Once they are about 2-3 bodies within eachother, they begin to lunge at eachother with their legs forward and elevated. Traditionally, after an initial altercation, one of the spiders will decamp and the other will chase the decamping spider. For the most part, the bigger spider will win the fight; however, if both spiders are similar in size than the spiders will extend and retract their legs at eachother for a longer period of time. Eventually, one male will turn out to be successful in the fight and they will be deemed the winner.  Distribution and Habitat  Although the genus Cosmophasis makes an appearance near tropical regions, the spiders Cosmophasis umbratica can only found in areas of India to Sumatra. These spiders are commonly found in areas of low vegetation, plants in extravagant gardens, and in some instances on tree trunks. The shinny, jumping spiders are mainly active when exposed to sunlight and in morning and the earlier side of the afternoon. In Joseph K H koh‚Äôs singapore guidebook, he claims that Singapore is filled with these spiders as they are constantly seen through out the Island for an aesthetic purpose with their glow. Although the exact origin of these spiders are not known, it is safe to assume that there is a direct correlation between the Ixora plant and these spiders.  Bites to Humans  = Venom = The C. umbertica are known to be harmless to people and do not tend to bite individuals. The spider‚Äôs venom is harmless and non poisonous unless one is allergic to spiders in general. There should not be any risk of getting bitten by C. umbratica. Even if one were to attack and try to kill these spiders (squash them), very rarely would these spiders bite as they are traditionally considered non violent. These C. umbertica are known to be one of the ‚Äúmost kind‚Äù spiders out in the world. Footnotes References * (2005). Extreme ultraviolet sexual dimorphism in jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae).

Career Marcus became an actor in 1984 after three years of training at Arts Educational Schools in London; he spent the first six months of his career touring throughout London's parks and schools in Robin Hood & The Tree Trick, which was quickly followed by his first film role as Moose in the cult film My Beautiful Laundrette. After a few years working in theatre, commercials and supporting roles on television, Marcus joined the cast of fledgling comedy Birds of a Feather as Dave, the lover of Sharon (Pauline Quirke). A year of acting in commercials introduced Marcus to director Peter Chelsom. Chelsom cast him right away as Gordon in Hear My Song, opposite Ned Beatty. This was followed by roles on British television, in programmes such as The Hot Dog Wars, Dangerfield, Class Act, Kavanagh QC and Our Friends in the North. Meanwhile, Marcus's movie career was also progressing, with roles opposite Timothy Dalton in The Beautician and the Beast, Robert Englund in The Killer Tongue and Richard Harris in Savage Hearts. In 1996 Marcus's agent arranged a meeting for a small low-budget movie with a then-unknown director named Guy Ritchie; Ritchie offered Marcus the role of Nick the Greek in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels alongside Nick Moran, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham and Matthew Vaughn. Three years later, the film was released and garnered a high level of success. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels led to further movie roles. Marcus completed a small role in Alan Parker's Angela's Ashes; he played Bouchon in Quills, alongside Kate Winslet, Michael Caine, Joaquin Phoenix and Geoffrey Rush; for Richard Eyre, he played Iris opposite Judi Dench and acted in Complete Female Stage Beauty with Claire Danes; and he also attained the role of Ted Ray in The Greatest Game Ever Played, directed by Bill Paxton. Alongside a very successful movie career, Marcus also starred in several American, Canadian and UK television series: Starhunter 2300, in which he played Rudolpho De Luna; he played the co-lead in the BBC series Cavegirl; he played Banjo and Broadman in the adaptations of Terry Pratchett‚Äôs Hogfather and The Colour of Magic, respectively; he starred in the two 20th anniversary episodes of ‚ÄúCasualty‚Äù; and Marcus also appeared in regular roles in Kingdom (with Stephen Fry) and Larkrise to Candleford. Marcus has also completed two films with the Wachowski Brothers: Speed Racer and Ninja Assassin. In 2012 Marcus appeared in five feature films: It‚Äôs A Lot, Two Days in the Smoke, Gridiron UK, AB Negative and Fast & Furious 6. In April 2012, he completed filming for independent British gangster thriller Two Days in the Smoke, in which he played the hitman Ben, alongside Snatch star Alan Ford and Matt Di Angelo from BBC Hustle. Smoke director Ben Pickering cast him as the vengeful Max in his second feature, the British psychological thriller Welcome to Curiosity, due for release on 25 May 2018 in the USA and Canada. In July 2012, Marcus launched a new Gangster London walking tour in association with Brit Movie Tours, in which he explores the dark history of London's East End. He also starred in Perry Bhandal's Interview with a Hitman (2012) as Traffikant, a Romanian Crime Boss, alongside Luke Goss. In May 2013, Marcus played the roles of Varney, Homeless man, Letting Agent & First Guard in a BBC radio adaptation of Neil Gaiman‚Äôs Neverwhere, adapted by Dirk Maggs. Personal life Marcus is married to Sarah and owns two small dogs, Fry and Ronnie. He has two main hobbies: golf and American Football, the latter of which he used to play and coach. Marcus played American football in the UK for the BAFL One team Sussex Thunder and retired at the end of the 2007 season. He was interviewed for Sky Sports' Sunday NFL coverage after the Thunder's 2007 fixture at the Ipswich Cardinals.

He transferred to the Indian Staff Corps in 1882, and, during the Mahdist War, became Commanding Royal Engineer for the Suakin Expeditionary Force in 1885. He was mentioned in despatches for his role in this Expedition. On return to the United Kingdom, Edwards became Commandant of the Royal School of Military Engineering. He was then appointed Commander of British Troops in China and Hong Kong in 1889. Edwards was also selected by the British Government to inspect the forces of the Australian colonies in 1889 and to advise on their organisation. He recommended a structure to enable the colonies to combine for mutual defence, uniform organisation and armament, a common Defence Act, a military college to train officers and a uniform gauge for railways.

In 1870, Netter founded Mikveh Israel, the first modern Jewish agricultural settlement in the Land of Israel. Biography Charles Netter's grave in Mikveh Israel Charles Netter was born in Strasbourg in 1826 to a Rabbinic family. He studied in Strasbourg and Belfort, and engaged in business in London, Moscow, and Lille. He later moved to Paris. Netter died in Jaffa on October 2, 1882, during a visit to Mikveh Israel. He is buried in Mikveh Israel, his tombstone erected by the AIU. He is considered the pioneer of Jewish agriculture in Israel, having founded the school which educated many members of Bilu and the First Aliyah. Several Israeli cities have named streets after him. Kfar Netter, a moshav near Netanya was founded in 1939, by graduates of Mikveh Israel. Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle (AIU) On May 17, 1860, in Paris, in response to antisemitic incidents such as the abduction of Edgardo Mortara and the Damascus affair, he was one of the six founders of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle. The founding members defined the organization's goals: \\"To gather good-natured people to fight against hate and prejudice. To create a society of young idealist and militant Jews that feel solidarity with all those who suffer from their condition as Jews or all those who are victims of prejudice, regardless of their religion. To ensure that culture replaces the ignorance of fanatics, for the good of all. If you believe that this would be an honor for your religion, a lesson for the people, a progress for humanity, a triumph for truth and for universal reason to witness all the vibrant forces of Judaism come together, small with respect to number but large with respect to love and good will, come to us, we are thus founding the Alliance isra√©lite universelle.\\" Netter was appointed general secretary of the newly formed organization, and was joined 4 years later by French-Jewish politician Adolphe Cr√©mieux who would serve as the president of the society while holding the position of French Minister of Justice. Mikveh Israel In 1868 Netter visited Palestine for the first time. He was sent as a representative of the AIU, to examine the needs of the Jewish community. Upon his return he recommended that a new agricultural settlement be founded, and be used as an agricultural school for Jewish men. Netter obtained an audience with the Ottoman Emperor in Constantinople, and was rewarded with land near Jaffa. The required funds were acquired from the AIU, and Mikveh Israel () was founded in 1870. During the first years Netter struggled with objections of the Jewish Old Yishuv leaders, who concentrated on Torah studies and relied on donations from Jews in the diaspora. The Old Yishuv opposition to Jewish manual labor in the holy land, and clashes with Arab inhabitants of nearby Yazur disrupted development and recruitment of students. The funds proved insufficient as well, and Netter donated his own money, and raised funds from other philanthropists, like Cr√©mieux and the Baron Maurice de Hirsch. Netter managed the school until 1873. He overcame the difficulties of establishing and maintaining the settlement, but accustomed to living conditions in Western-Europe, his health deteriorated. Following his doctor's advice he returned to Europe, but continued to raise funds and support the school, and continued his activities for the AIU. He was involved in protecting the rights and safety of the Jewish community in Morocco, and was in charge of emigration of Russian-Jewish refugees to North-America following the introduction of the May Laws. Freemason lodge Charles Netter was one of the twenty signers of a petition sent to a Canadian Freemason leader, who subsequently agreed to the establishment of a lodge \\"in Jerusalem and surroundings\\". Only six of those who signed the letter were living in Ottoman Palestine at the time, Netter being the only Jew among the six. The initiator was the prominent American poet and Freemason, Rob Morris, while Rolla Floyd (1832-1911), a fellow American, Jaffa resident and tourism entrepreneur, and German photographer Peter Bergheim (1813-1895) were another two of the six Holy Land-based petitioners. As a result of their initiative, the Royal Solomon Mother Lodge N¬∞ 293 was consecrated on May 7, 1873. R.W.Bro.

Ireland. John Diamond (1823 ‚Äì October 20, 1857), aka Jack or Johnny, was an Irish-AmericanHill and Hatch 99. dancer and blackface minstrel performer. Diamond entered show business at age 17 and soon came to the attention of circus promoter P. T. Barnum. In less than a year, Diamond and Barnum had a falling-out, and Diamond left to perform with other blackface performers. Diamond's dance style merged elements of English, Irish, and African dance. For the most part, he performed in blackface and sang popular minstrel tunes or accompanied a singer or instrumentalist. Diamond's movements emphasized lower-body movements and rapid footwork with little movement above the waist. Diamond was most famous for a series of challenge dances. He regularly advertised that he could defeat all comers in a dancing contest, and he made good on his boasts. However, Diamond soon came to the attention of the dancer whom Barnum had replaced him with, a young black man known as Master Juba. Diamond and Juba fought dance-offs through the mid-1840s; records indicate that Juba won all but one. Accordingly, historian Robert Toll calls Diamond the \\"greatest white minstrel dancer\\".Toll 43. Emphasis added. Career In 1840, Diamond won $500 in a New York City jig competition. Circus proprietor P. T. Barnum took notice and hired the boy, touring him throughout the United States and Europe. Ever the showman, Barnum claimed that the dancer was a mere 12 years old (he was really 17) and billed him as the \\"King of Diamonds\\" in advertisements.Knowles 86. Diamond performed solo and as part of a pair with blackface singers and musicians. For a time, he was teamed with \\"the King of Banjo players, and the Emperor of Extravaganza Singers\\", Billy Whitlock. Their advertisements exclaimed, \\"Second night of the engagement of the little 'Wirginny Nigger,' only 12 years old, who can outdance the nation, and come some 'Heel and Toe Breakdowns,' that are a caution to all darkies, and no mistake!\\"Vauxhall Gardens announcement in the Morning Herald, New York, July 18, 1840. Quoted in Nathan 62. Diamond earned a bad reputation among promoters and managers. One source claimed that his dancing was \\"considerably better than his temper and disposition.\\"Knowles 87, see note 19. In February 1841, Diamond extorted money from P. T. Barnum and deserted his former mentor to go on a week-long binge of alcohol and women. Barnum sent a letter to his colleagues to caution them against hiring the dancer. Barnum claimed Diamond had \\"overdrawn the money due him to the amount of $95 and has during the last week expended a hundred dollars in brothels and haunts of dissipation & vice.\\"Quoted in Knowles 88. Free of Barnum, Diamond played in pairs or groups of three or four blackface performers. In January 1843, he was in a circus with other blackface performers; the program promised \\"Negro extravaganzas, songs, dances, and locomotive imitations by Whitlock, Diamond, John Daniels and Gardner.\\" The program does not make it clear whether they performed simultaneously or individually.Circus announcement for the Amphitheatre in the New York Herald, January 19, 1843. Quoted in Nathan 66. After the Virginia Minstrels formed in 1843, Whitlock convinced Diamond to perform with them in order to increase the group's exposure.Knowles 87. In 1845, Diamond was touring the United States with the Old Dominion Circus. In 1849, he was touring with the Olympic Circus. He was still performing regularly in the mid 1850s. Diamond eventually joined the Ethiopian Serenaders minstrel troupe.Day 49. Challenge dances In the 1840s, Diamond began a series of challenge dances wherein he dared his rivals to best him in a contest of skill. Diamond publicized his challenges in popular newspapers. Such trials usually had three judges, one who judged time, one style, and one execution.Knowles 89. A typical challenge read: > Master Diamond, who delineates the Ethiopian character superior to any other > white person, hereby challenges any person in the world to trial of skill > at Negro dancing, in all its varieties, for a wager of from > $200.00‚Äì$1,000.00.Playbill, New Theatre, Mobile, February 24, 1841. Quoted > in Knowles 87. Diamond won match after match in city after city, and his fame grew exponentially. He earned a host of imitators and copycats, many of whom took his name and pretended to be him. After their inamicable split, Barnum had replaced Diamond with a young, unknown black man named William Henry Lane. The new prot√©g√© took the stage name \\"Master Juba\\" and centered his act on imitations of \\"all the principal dancers in the United States\\", followed by his own style.Playbill for \\"Master Juba . . . and the Ethiopian Minstrels\\", 1845. Quoted in Nathan 113. Diamond was always the last dancer Juba imitated, as the Irish-American was Juba's only real rival.Knowles 88. Diamond and Juba's war of steps reached a fever pitch when the two agreed to a challenge dance against one another. A series of widely advertised Diamond‚ÄìJuba dance- offs followed: > Excitement among the Sporting Community‚ÄîMatch between John Diamond and Juba. > > The favorites are now the dancers, and he who can cut, shuffle, and > attitudanize with the greatest facility is reckoned the best fellow and > pockets the most money. > > Match dances are very frequently got up, and seem to give general > satisfaction, if we are allowed to judge from the crowds who throng to > witness them. > > We have not had a real, scientific, out-and-out trial of skill since that > between Dick Pelham and John Diamond at the Chatham; but it appears we are > soon to have another of these refined and elevating exhibitions. > > A match has been made between John Diamond and a little negro called > \\"Juba,\\" by some of the sporting community, and is to come off in the course > of a few weeks. The stake is large, and an unparalleled display will be the > result.New York Sporting Whip, January 28, 1843. Quoted in Cockrell 138. The Diamond‚ÄìJuba dance-offs continued through the mid-1840s. Existing records show that Diamond lost all but one.Knowles 90; Toll 43. Dance style John Diamond's dances involved acrobatic footwork, as shown in this detail from the sheet music cover of Whitlock's Collection of Ethiopian Melodies, 1846. The banjoist is Billy Whitlock, but it is unclear whether the dancer is John Diamond or Frank Diamond. Diamond repertoire was a mixture of African American, English, and Irish steps. He danced the \\"five mile out of town dance\\", the \\"Long Island breakdown\\", the \\"Negro camptown hornpipe\\", the \\"ole Virginna breakdown\\", and the \\"smokehouse dance\\". A playbill claimed that his \\"rattle snake jig\\" had 120 steps.Playbill for the Ordway's Aeolians, Boston, January 2, 1852. Quoted in Nathan 83. The steps and maneuvers that made up these dances had equally colorful names; his hornpipe featured the \\"double shuffle\\", the \\"heel and toe\\", the \\"pigeon wing\\", and \\"running on his heels\\". His energetic breakdowns were among his more famous dances.Cockrell 88. Diamond performed in blackface, but some of his dances were strictly British or Irish in origin and were danced without makeup. Examples of these were an Irish jig called the \\"fireman's hornpipe\\" and the \\"naval hornpipe in the character of a Yankee sailor\\".Announcement of Vauxhall Gardens in the Morning Herald, New York, July 29, 1840, and playbill of the New Theatre, Mobile, February 24, 1841. Quoted in Nathan 95‚Äì6. Diamond's dances were characterized by little upper-body movement and rapid footwork. He left his upper body relaxed so as to bring attention to his feet. One characteristic step was to lean forward and dangle his hands loosely, look to the side, and slide across the stage with a heel‚Äìtoe alternation.Nathan 61‚Äì2. Noah M. Ludlow, a theatre manager, wrote that \\"He could twist his feet and legs, while dancing, into more fantastic forms than I ever witnessed before or since in any human being.\\"Quoted in Knowles 86‚Äì7; see footnote 6. His playbills proclaimed Diamond a performer of \\"the greatest display of heel and toe genus ever witnessed\\" and that \\"Now de heels, if dares any music in you, its got to come out\\". Diamond's rapid footwork rapped out percussive patterns on the floor. He advertised that he could create music with his heels.Nathan 73. Diamond's act also incorporated singing, either by a partner or by Diamond himself. When partnered with a banjoist, Diamond danced and leapt about the stage while the musician played. These acts involved precise choreography.Nathan 64. His repertoire consisted of popular blackface numbers, such as \\"Jim-a-Long-Josey\\". He performed stump speeches as well, such as his \\"Negro speech in Congress\\".New Theatre playbill, Mobile, February 24, 1841. Printed in Nathan 61. Notes References * Cockrell, Dale (1997).

He was a founding member of the Union of Russian Socialist Revolutionaries; later, a founding member and theoretician of the Socialist Revolutionary Party in Russia; and an ideologist of Yiddishism and Jewish Diaspora nationalism, which influenced the Jewish territorialist and nationalist movements. He was an advocate of Yiddish language and culture and was a vice-president of the Czernowitz Yiddish Language Conference of 1908, which declared Yiddish to be \\"a national language of the Jewish people.\\" Biography Issued by the Zhitlowsky Anniversary Committee in 1935:◊©◊ú◊ê÷∏◊§÷ø◊ú◊ê÷∏◊ñ◊ê◊ô◊ß◊ô◊ô◊ò: ◊ñ◊©◊ô◊ò◊ú◊ê÷∏◊∞◊°◊ß◊ô ◊ë◊ô◊ê÷∏◊í◊®◊ê÷∑◊§÷ø◊ô◊¢ ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊¢◊†◊í◊ú◊ô◊© =Early years= Chaim Zhitlowsky was born in 1865, in the small town of Ushachy, in the province of Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire. When he was five years old, his parents moved to Vitebsk, the capital of the province. On his mother's side he was descended from artisans and merchants, on his father's‚Äîfrom an aristocratic and well-educated family. His father, Joseph, studied to be a rabbi in the Yeshiva of Volozhin, but chose to become a merchant. Though an ardent Lubavich Chassid he was well versed in Haskalah (enlightenment) literature, and often recited satiric Haskalah tales and poems in Yiddish and Hebrew at family gatherings. Joseph Zhitlowsky's business prospered. He moved to a richer, more exclusive section of the city. He kept an open house. A tutor of the Russian language was engaged for Chaim, but he continued his elementary religious studies at a kheyder. Soon Chaim became friendly with high school students of his neighborhood and began to read Russian literature. He made his first literary attempt, translating the Yiddish version of Uncle Tom's Cabin into Hebrew. On his 13th birthday (his bar-mitzvah) Chaim made the acquaintance of Shloyme Rappaport, who was later to become S. Ansky, the famous author of The Dybuk. A warm lifelong friendship developed between Zhitlowsky and Ansky, who had a weakness in common ‚Äì writing. For a short time they issued a handwritten (holographic) magazine called Vitebsk Bells. = Early activity= On entering the third grade of the Russian Gymnasium in 1879, Zhitlowsky came into contact with revolutionary circles, and, for the time being was estranged from Yiddish and other matters of Jewish interest. He was sobered, however, by the pogroms of the early 1880s, and his naive cosmopolitanism was quickly dissipated. He left the gymnasium, went to Tula in 1881 and there was engaged in spreading Socialist Revolutionary propaganda. Shocked by the view of some members of that party, that pogroms were a step toward the liberation of the Russian people, he left the party. When he returned to Vitebsk he was caught in the current of the then rising Palestine movement. He was inspired by the vision of the Jewish colonies and a Jewish peasantry, but the religious character of that Palestinism did not appeal to him. He sought to publish a magazine to propagandize \\"his idea\\"‚Äîa synthesis of Jewish nationalism and socialism. At first his father was willing to finance this enterprise, but was talked out of it by an ardent Palestinian friend. In 1885 Zhitlowsky tried to found a Jewish section of the illegal Narodnya Volya party, but the Jews in the central committee of the Narodnya Volya who believed in cosmopolitanism and assimilation defeated the Zhitlowsky project. This was a severe blow for the young Jewish revolutionary. His grandfather consoled him, pointing out the revolutionary character of the prophets, and of the great Jewish intellects of the later times. This quickened Zhitlowsky's interest in Jewish history. At the St. Petersburg Imperial Library he found books he needed, and soon he established contact with a St. Petersburg group of the Narodnaya Volya. His first work, a treatise in Russian entitled Thought of the Historical Fate of the Jewish People was published in Moscow in 1887 when he was only twenty-two. (Shortly before that he had been banished by the police from St. Petersburg). The liberal Russian press enthusiastically greeted and responded warmly to his ideas, but it met with scant favor among Jewish critics, because it contained no solution of the problems it treated. Several suspected him of being a Christian missionary. Zhitlowsky returned to Vitebsk for a short time, from there he went to Galicia where it was much easier to preach Socialist doctrines among the Jewish masses. He became acquainted with a group of Jewish revolutionists from Zurich, who were engaged in disseminating radical literature in Yiddish. He went to Berlin and resumed his study of Jewish history, Marxism and philosophy. He was expelled from Germany, under the anti- Socialist law, and moved to Zurich. He immediately became active, founding the non-partisan \\"Verein f√ºr Wissenschaft und Leben des J√ºdischen Volkes,\\" for the purpose of inculcating nationalism and socialism among the Jewish masses. He engaged in debates between the orthodox and the adherents of the Narodnaya Volya. The latter evolved into the Social Revolutionary Party. He moved to Berne to study. Here, too, he founded an organization similar to the one in Zurich. When famine broke out in Russia in 1891, he and Charles Rappaport founded a non-partisan organization to help the afflicted. The work was doomed to failure from the start. The representatives of the various political groups could not forget their differences. The work ended, even before it had begun. Though engrossed as ever in social and political activity, he found time to prepare his Ph.D. thesis, and to continue his studies in Marxism. His debut in Jewish literature took place in 1891. The London newspaper Freie Welt published his translation of two revolutionary poems. In 1892 The London Fund for Revolutionary Publication printed his Russian tractate A Jew to Jews, under the pseudonym of I. Khisin. In his first socialist pamphlet on a Jewish theme, he demanded national as well as civil equality for Jews. He was also active in an organization which combated the anti-Jewish \\"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\\" Toward the latter part of 1893, Zhitlowsky, now a Ph.D., aided by Shloyme Rappaport, M. Rosenbaum and several other Russian radicals, founded the Federation of Socialist Revolutionaries from which later developed the Socialist Revolutionary Party. The group opposed dogmatic Marxism. The newspaper The Russian Worker, appearing under Zhitlowsky's and Rappaport's editorship, spread propaganda among the masses. The Verband published in 1898 Zhitlowsky's theoretical work, Socialism and the Fight for Political Freedom, written under the pen name Gregorovich. In this work, he tried to synthesize the three principal currents of the Russian revolutionary movement. From time to time, he contributed to several well- known Russian magazines, such as Russkoye Bogastvo; articles on Marxism and philosophy in the Jewish‚ÄîRussian Voskhod; and contributed also to Sozialistische Monatshefte and Deutsche Worte. In 1896, he organized the Group of Jewish Socialists Abroad, the purpose of which was to prepare revolutionary propaganda literature in Yiddish, with the Communist Manifesto as a beginning. For this revolutionary library, Zhitlowsky wrote an introduction entitled Yiddish‚ÄîWhy?. The Bund which published the booklet thought that Zhitlowsky's introduction was not sufficiently revolutionary and too nationalistic, because the author expressed the belief that the rebirth of the Yiddish language and literature would lead to the national and social awakening of the Jewish people. Zhitlowsky attended the First Zionist Congress convened at Basle in 1897. He was against founding a Zionist party. He believed in the necessity for a League for Jewish Colonization, a league that would appeal to all those opposed to Herzel's political Zionism. A day after the Congress, Zhitlowsky addressed the delegates and guests on Yiddish and the purposes of the Yiddish publishing house Zeit Geist, which had been founded by a group of Jewish intellectuals and revolutionaries. In this speech were first laid the foundations of Yiddishism, which subsequently became deeply rooted in Eastern Europe and America. He came into close relations with the Bund which published his pamphlet Zionism or Socialism? in 1898. In 1900, Zhitlowsky and John Edelheim founded the Deutscher Academischer Soziale Wissenschafte. They also took over the magazine Sozialistische Monatshefte. He toured important European centers, making connections with revolutionary leaders of England, France, and Germany. The Deutscher Academischer Varlag existed several years. It was often attacked by orthodox Marxists because of the \\"revisionist\\" works published by him. =Territorialism= After the Kishineff pogrom of 1903 Zhitlowsky turned toward the territorialistic movement. He conceived the idea of a Jewish Sejm (parliament). At his initiative a group of radical nationalists and Zionists organized the Jewish Socialist Workers Party (commonly called the Sejmist party). In 1904, Zhitlowsky served as delegate at the International Socialist Congress in Amsterdam, and his fight that the Socialist Revolutionary Party should have a representative in the International Socialist Bureau ended victoriously. When the first Yiddish daily in Russia, the St. Petersburg Frajnd, was founded, Zhitlowsky, under the pen name N. Gaydaroff, contributed a series of articles entitled The Jewish People and the Yiddish Language. In 1904 Zhitlowsky and \\"Babushka\\" (Granny) Breshkovskaya were sent by the Socialist Revolutionary Party to America to collect funds for the party and carry on a propaganda of its ideas. With the Party's permission he gave lectures on various Jewish matters during his stay in America. At that time the Jewish radical intelligentsia in America was under the influence of naive socialist cosmopolitanism, which expressed itself in scorn for Jewish national problems, and for the Yiddish language and culture. When Zhitlowsky in a series of lectures pointed out that there was no contradiction between progressive nationalism and the socialist ideal, he encountered strong opposition. Very soon, however, many of his erstwhile opponents turned into his most ardent partisans. After a two-year sojourn in America, he returned to Europe. He spent some time in Galicia and then went to Russia, where his native province, Vitebsk, nominated him for Duma elections. The government refused to allow him to take his seat when elected. The reversal of this decision by the Senate came too late, for the Tsar had dissolved the Duma. Zhitlowsky spent 1907 in Finland. With the aid of Gregory Gershuni, he engaged in a strong Socialist Revolutionary propaganda. He called a congress of socialist factions which leaned more closely to the Socialist Revolutionary ideology. This congress adopted several of his resolutions which increased the influence of the Sejmists (Parliamentarians) The Socialist Revolutionaries and the Sejmists sent him as their delegate to the International Socialist Congress at Stuttgart that year. Here he fought for the rights of these two parties in the International Socialist Bureau. In 1908 he was sent to America by the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Sejmists. With the help of the following he had attracted among the radical Jewish intellectuals during his previous visit, Zhitlowsky founded a publishing house that issued a new monthly, Dos Naye Leben (The New Life). Under his editorship, the journal exercised great influence on Yiddish culture, including the development of free socialist thought, and became an organ of modern Yiddish literature; for the six years it existed (until 1914), Dos Naye Leben was a spiritual home of many Jewish publicists and scientists.Michels, Tony (2005). A Fire in Their Hearts: Yiddish Socialists in New York. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. p. 147-148. Zhitlowsky returned to Europe in 1908, where he participated in the Czernowitz Yiddish Language Conference. Under the leadership of its originators, Zhitlowsky, J. L. Perez and Nathan Birnbaum, the Conference for the first time declared Yiddish to be \\"a national language of the Jewish people.\\" =Yiddish education= In 1909 Zhitlowsky raised (in his magazine Dos Naye Leben) the question of founding Yiddish secular schools in America. In 1910 at the Convention of the Poale Zion Party in Montreal, Canada, that matter was placed by him on the order of the day, and there and then the inauguration of this type of school was proclaimed. The first Folkshul in New York City was opened on 10 December 1910 at 143 Madison St., and Zhitlowsky took an active part in the growth of the school. His influence was also very considerable in the creation, some years later, of the Jewish secular schools of the Workmen's Circle, despite the opposition of Abe Cahan, editor of The Jewish Daily Forward who advocated assimilation of Jewish workers into the general working class. = Later years= In 1912, the thousands of Zhitlowsky's followers attracted by his writings and lectures, celebrated the 25th anniversary of his literary activity. Four volumes of his collected works, shortly followed by two others, were published in connection with this anniversary. In 1913 publication of Dos Naye Leben ceased, and Zhitlowsky made a lecture tour of Jewish student colonies of the important academic centers in France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. He also visited Palestine in order to study the possibilities of widespread Jewish colonization there. He returned to America at the outbreak of the World War I. Until then he had been a contributor to the Warheit, edited by L. A. Miller. He now joined the staff of the newly organized Day. He advocated America's neutrality, and battled against the pro- German feelings of the man in the street and of the Yiddish press. Zhitlowsky also joined the movement for a Jewish congress and when it was convened he played an important part in its deliberations. At the same time, he continued his tracts on philosophy and sociology in the Yiddish magazine Zukunft. In 1920, publication commenced of Die Zeit (The Times), a daily of the Poale Zion party, a party that Zhitlowsky had joined a few years before, and he became one of its major contributors. When the publication ceased in 1921, Zhitlowsky became a contributor of Der Tog (The Day). In 1922, Zhitlowsky and Shmuel Niger renewed the publication of Dos Naye Leben. Its point of view remained unaltered. In 1923, when the magazine was discontinued, Zhitlowsky returned to Europe to complete The Spiritual Struggle of the Jewish People for Freedom. He visited Palestine and toured the Jewish centers in Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, between 1924 and 1925. Everywhere he was received with the greatest enthusiasm and admiration. On 28 November 1925, Zhitlowsky's 60th birthday was celebrated at the Manhattan Opera House in New York. Similar celebrations were held in other American and European cities visited by Zhitlowsky. A Zhitlowsky memorial volume was published in Berlin containing articles and reminiscences of his intimate friends and disciples. At Zhitlowsky's suggestion, the proceeds from the book were given to the Yiddish Scientific Institute (YIVO) of Vilno, which Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, as well as Zhitlowsky, were members of its Honorary Board of Directors. Through his and S. Ellsberg's initiative, the Yiddish Culture Society was founded in September 1929. The purpose of the organization was to unite all adherents of Yiddish to enable them to work in common for the development of Yiddish, the Yiddish school and Yiddish culture in general. He was also one of the editors of the weekly Yiddish, issued by the Yiddish Culture Society. When the Jewish-American Congress decided to resume activity on a democratic basis, Zhitlowsky at once engaged in its labors. He was one of the leaders of the Worker's Bloc, and supported the calling of a Jewish World Congress. On the eve of his 70th birthday, he was no less active as a writer and leader than in former years. Other writings of Zhitlowsky include: * Philosophy (published in 1910), the first Yiddish book to deal with the development of philosophic thought; * a Yiddish translation of Friedrich Nietzsche's Also Sprach Zarathustra; * an essay on Einstein's Theory of Relativity (published in Warsaw in 1930);Roland Gruschka, Tuvia Schalit's 'Di spetsyele relativitets-teorye' of 1927 and other introductions to the Theory of Relativity in Yiddish, Science in Context, 20 (2007), 317‚Äì338 (pp. 323‚Äì324, 332‚Äì333, 334, 335). * two lectures on Science, Philosophy and Religion (published in 1931). The committee sponsoring the celebration of Zhitlowsky's 70th birthday planned to publish his collected works and memoirs. During his literary career, Zhitlowsky has contributed to the most important Yiddish newspapers and magazines in America and Europe, and helped to create a style for Yiddish publicistic and scientific writing.  His thought In his monograph, Zhitlowsky; His Life and Work, Shmuel Niger made the following summary of Zhitlowsky's achievements: In the world of universal ideas: * Fought against dogmatism in philosophy in general, and in the philosophy of Dialectic Materialism, in particular. * Strove to unite all elements of labor, factory workers, peasants, intellectual workers‚Äîin the struggle for socialism. * Fought for the principles of autonomy and federalism as against centralization in the State. * Theoretic and practical propaganda of Socialist Revolutionary ideas. In the Jewish world: * Fought for the secularization and separation of nationality from religion. * Fought for progressive national culture, against assimilation and narrow nationalism. * Theoretic proof of Galuth-nationalism. * Synthesis of nationalism arid socialism, of Galuth-nationalism and territorialism. * Influenced the programs of the Jewish nationalist parties. * Interested radical Jewish intelligentsia in Yiddish cultural life and work. * Helped to clarify and crystallize theYiddish radical movement in America. * Enriched Yiddish language and oratory. Propagated the idea of the new secular Yiddish school. * Pioneer work in the field of scientific and philosophical literature in Yiddish. This is a short summary of over a half of century of scientific, literary, journalistic work, and activity as a lecturer and publisher, all in the spirit of socialism and progressive nationalism among the Jewish masses in America and abroad.

A former amateur sumo champion, he turned professional in 1996. His highest rank was maegashira 3. He became the head coach of Tokitsukaze stable in 2007 following the dismissal of the previous stablemaster. Early life With influence from his father, Tokitsuumi participated in sumo competitions from the age of three, and after a stint with judo in junior high school, he began practicing sumo again in high school and university. He did very well in sumo at Tokyo University of Agriculture, but after graduating, he passed an entrance test to begin working at a printing company and was planning to have a career with them. But, his father, after seeing his continued success in amateur sumo, suggested he try his hand at professional sumo. Soon afterwards, he was recruited by the former ≈çzeki Yutakayama, a fellow Tokyo University of Agriculture graduate, and joined his Tokitsukaze stable. He made his debut in March 1996 at the age of 22. Career After joining at the bottom of the third makushita division, Tokitsuumi took just over a year to reach the elite sekitori ranks, making the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in May 1997. He won the j≈´ry≈ç division championship at his first attempt with a 12-3 record, but then fell flat with a 5-10 mark in the next tournament. In July 1998 he produced a 10-5 score at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 2 and was promoted to the top makuuchi division for September. Tokitsuumi had a long career in the top makuuchi division. His four special prizes for Technique were evidence of his ability, but he always struggled when promoted above the mid-level maegashira ranks. He never reached a san'yaku rank, his highest rank being maegashira 3. A poor result in 2005 took him down to j≈´ry≈ç but he immediately recovered his position in top division by winning the j≈´ry≈ç championship for the second time in July 2005. His best score in the top division was a 12-3 result in January 2006. Just two tournaments later he suffered an injury which took him down to j≈´ry≈ç once again, and it took him three tournaments to get back. However he showed few signs of slowing down, comfortably holding his own in the lower maegashira ranks in 2007. Fighting style Tokitsuumi was a yotsu-sumo wrestler who preferred fighting on the mawashi to pushing or thrusting. His favoured grip was migi-yotsu, with his left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. He won over 40 per cent of his matches by yori-kiri, or force out. He was also fond of shitatenage, or underarm throw. Retirement On October 9, 2007, he suddenly retired from being an active sumo wrestler and became head coach of Tokitsukaze stable, after the previous head coach (former komusubi Futatsury≈´) was dismissed by the Japan Sumo Association for his involvement in a hazing scandal. He was initially reluctant to do so, having not yet reached san'yaku, but was persuaded by the former Yutakayama, who had always regarded him as his preferred successor. He was a popular choice among his fellow wrestlers. In a highly unusual move, the banzuke (or ranking sheet) for the November 2007 tournament contained a blank space in the rank where Tokitsuumi's name ought to have appeared (West maegashira 11). Ordinarily, when a wrestler retires he does not succeed immediately as a head coach and owner of a stable. In this case, due to the unusual nature of the dismissal of the previous Tokitsukaze stablemaster, he acquired both the stable and toshiyori-kabu (coaching license) for the Tokitsukaze name immediately on retirement. Had his name remained on the banzuke he would therefore have been listed twice. The blank space was left to avoid the confusion in the rankings that would otherwise result. The last time a comparable situation occurred was in 1873, when two wrestlers were expelled from professional sumo as agitators. They formed a new organization (the modern Takasago stable). On that occasion, their names were blotted out of the banzuke with ink. His official retirement ceremony, or danpatsu-shiki, took place at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on October 5, 2008. In June 2010 he faced censure for his involvement in the gambling scandal rocking the sumo world, after it was revealed that he had illegally bet on baseball while still an active wrestler. On July 4 he was demoted to the lowest toshiyori level on the elder hierarchy, with no opportunity for re- promotion for at least five years.http://www.japantoday.com/category/sports/view/kotomitsuki-otake-to-be- fired-but-get-severance-pay Tokitsukaze has produced the top division wrestlers Tosayutaka, Sh≈çdai and Yuktakayama. He was told not to leave his house and prevented from attending the September 2020 tournament after he breached the Sumo Association's covid-19 guidelines by travelling to another prefecture. In the same month he was unable to take part in the ceremony marking Sh≈çdai's promotion to ≈çzeki, despite having been given permission to do so, due to an acute illness. He was demoted from iin level to toshiyori by the Sumo Association on October 1. During his trip he had engaged in several non-essential activities such as eating out, playing golf and visiting his home town of Got≈ç, Nagasaki.

Separated by Coorooman Creek from the larger towns of Emu Park and Yeppoon to the north, Keppel Sands is a charming village-style township centred on fishing and holiday making. Facilities in Keppel Sands include a hotel, caravan park, motel, Australia Post outlet, local store, and two boat ramps. The Coast Guard are located at Pumpkin Creek at the southern edge of the town. Keppel Sands is home to many retirees and is a popular location for fishing and crabbing. History Housing along Schofield Parade (esplanade), 2016 Savoy Theatre, 2011 Originally known as Sandhills, the town takes its current name from Keppel Bay, which in turn was named on 27 May 1770 by Lieutenant James Cook , commander of HMS Endeavour, after Admiral Augustus Keppel, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Keppel Sands has long been a popular beach to visit for people from Rockhampton and the surrounding area. Over the years beach huts and weekenders gradually gave way to the more permanent housing of today. Boarding houses were popular until the road improved and daytripping to the beach became possible. The Savoy Theatre was a place for both movies and dances. Mount Barlow Provisional School opened in 1903 and became Mount Barlow State School on 1 Jan 1909. It was renamed Sandhills State School about 1930 and then renamed Keppel Sands State School about 1938. Keppel Sands Post Office opened on 1 September 1927.

Until 2013, the genus included a single species, Linnaea borealis. In 2013, on the basis of molecular phylogenetic evidence, the genus was expanded to include species formerly placed in Abelia (excluding section Zabelia), Diabelia, Dipelta, Kolkwitzia and Vesalea. However, this is rejected by the majority of subsequent scientific literature and flora. Linnaea borealis was a favorite of Carl Linnaeus, founder of the modern system of binomial nomenclature, for whom the genus was named. Taxonomy The genus Linnaea was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus. The name had been used earlier by the Dutch botanist Jan Frederik Gronovius, and was given in honour of Linnaeus. Linnaeus adopted the name in 1753 in Species Plantarum for the then sole species Linnaea borealis, because it was his favourite plant. Most botanists resisted placing other species in the genus, treating Linnaea as a monotypic genus. However, molecular phylogenetic studies from 2001 onwards showed that a number of genera were related to Linnaea (the \\"Linnaea clade\\"), although one of them, Abelia, was not monophyletic. In 2013, to maintain monophyletic genera, Maarten Christenhusz proposed merging Abelia (excluding section Zabelia), Diabelia, Dipelta, Kolkwitzia and Vesalea into Linnaea. This proposal has been adopted by some secondary sources, including Plants of the World Online. However, other sources prefer to maintain the segregation of Linnaeoideae into the traditional genera on grounds of morphology, biogeography and nomenclatural simplicity. =Species= The following species are accepted by PoWO (2019), but not by Hassler (2019) : * Linnaea amabilis ‚Äì China (Anhui, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi); rare in the wild but widely cultivated in China, Japan, Europe and North America * Linnaea borealis ‚Äì circumboreal and subarctic (Canada, northern and central USA, Greenland, northern Britain, Fennoscandia, Baltic States, Mainland Europe south to the Alps, and the Balkans, Ukraine, Russia, Siberia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, northern China, Korea, northern Japan) * Linnaea chinensis ‚Äì China (Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang), northern Vietnam, Taiwan; commonly cultivated in China and Japan, occasionally in Europe and North America * Linnaea coriacea ‚Äì Mexico (Nuevo Le√≥n, San Luis Potos√≠) * Linnaea dipelta ‚Äì China (Gansu, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan) * Linnaea elegans ‚Äì China (Gansu, Sichuan) * Linnaea engleriana * Linnaea floribunda ‚Äì Mexico (Chiapas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz) * Linnaea forrestii ‚Äì south-central China (southwestern Sichuan, northwestern Yunnan) * Linnaea √ó grandiflora ‚Äì garden hybrid of L. chinensis and L. uniflora, only known from cultivation * Linnaea grandifolia ‚Äì Central Mexico (Quer√©taro) * Linnaea macrotera * Linnaea mexicana ‚Äì south-central Mexico (Oaxaca) * Linnaea occidentalis ‚Äì Mexico (Durango) * Linnaea parvifolia * Linnaea serrata ‚Äì China (Zhejiang), Japan (Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku) * Linnaea spathulata ‚Äì China (Zhejiang), Japan (Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku) * Linnaea tetrasepala ‚Äì Japan (Honshu, Shikoku) * Linnaea uniflora ‚Äì China (Fujian, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan); frequently cultivated * Linnaea yunnanensis ‚Äì China (Gansu, Guizhou, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan), and adjacent Burma Cultivation Several species of Linnaea are in cultivation.

This overflow is usually conceived in a non-temporal way as a permanent relationship of causation rather than as an event causing an entity to come into existence at a given point in time. The word \\"emanation\\" can refer either to the process of emanation or to the thing emanated. Equivalent concepts are found in Gnosticism and in Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism). This article explores similar concepts in Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism. Concepts The Neoplatonic concept of emanation can be compared to the statements made by fourteenth-century Eastern Orthodox theologian Gregory Palamas. He drew a distinction between God's essence and energies, affirming that God was unknowable in His essence, but knowable in His energies.Lossky, Vladimir, The Theology of Light in the Thought of St. Gregory Palamas, in In the Image and Likeness of God, New York: St. Vladimir‚Äôs Seminary Press, 1947 Palamas never enumerated God's energies but described them as ways that God could act in the universe, and particularly on people, from the light shining from the face of Moses after he descended from Mount Sinai, to the light surrounding Moses, Elijah and Jesus on Mount Tabor during the transfiguration of Jesus. For Palamas, God's energies were not separate from God, but were God. However, the idea of energies was kept distinct from the idea of the three Persons of the Trinity, the unity of the Three Persons of the Trinity being united by God's transcendent Essence. The Orthodox theologian Niketas Stethatos describes a tenfold hierarchy, which can be paralleled in both the Kabbalistic belief in ten successive emanations, known as sefirot, and the Neopythagorean belief in the power of the first ten numbers, as set out in pseudo-Iamblichus' Theologoumena Arithmeticae: :Nikitas Stithatos' decad has affinities with the decads of both the foregoing theories (kabbalistic and pythagorean decads), although it cannot be identified with either. It has roots in the conception of the celestial hierarchy or concatenation formulated by St Dionysios the Areopagite.Pseudo-Dionysius; Luibƒ•aeid, Colm; Rorem, Paul; Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works, The Paulist Press, 1987 This hierarchy constitutes a threefold structure, each level of which consists of three orders or ranks of celestial intelligences, giving a total of nine such interlocking and mutually participating orders. The function of the lowest of these orders, that of the angels, has two aspects. The first is to transmit the divine grace and illumination, which it has received from God through the meditation of the orders about it, to the order below it, the human order, that taken as a whole thus represents the tenth order, the second is to convert the human intelligence, the \\"finest of all the offerings; that can be made by this human order, so that it mounts upward and stage by stage returns, again through the meditation of the celestial hierarchy, to a state of union with its divine source and in this way achieves Divinization. This double meditation descending and ascending, constitutes the cyclic movement....\\"Palmer, G.E.H.; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos, The Philokalia: Vols 1-4, New York: St. Vladimir‚Äôs Seminary Press, 1953 He further states in On Spiritual Knowledge, verse 99, that, \\"The nine heavenly powers sing hymns of praise that have a threefold structure....\\" Palmer, G.E.H.; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos, The Philokalia: Vols 1-4, New York: St. Vladimir‚Äôs Seminary Press, 1953 *The Highest Rank: Thrones, Cherubim and Seraphim. *The Middle Rank: Authorities, Dominions and Powers. *The Lowest Rank: Principalities, Archangels and Angels. *Humanity is the last component to complete the Decad.

His grandson was Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chaussard. Life In 1722, Chevotet won the Acad√©mie royale d'architecture's very first Prix de Rome with a study of a triumphal arch.

They can be considered as an extension of the classical soliton concept in conservative systems. An alternative terminology includes autosolitons, spots and pulses. Apart from aspects similar to the behavior of classical particles like the formation of bound states, DSs exhibit interesting behavior - e.g. scattering, creation and annihilation - all without the constraints of energy or momentum conservation. The excitation of internal degrees of freedom may result in a dynamically stabilized intrinsic speed, or periodic oscillations of the shape.  Historical development  = Origin of the soliton concept = DSs have been experimentally observed for a long time. Helmholtz measured the propagation velocity of nerve pulses in 1850\\\\. In 1902, Lehmann found the formation of localized anode spots in long gas-discharge tubes. Nevertheless, the term \\"soliton\\" was originally developed in a different context. The starting point was the experimental detection of \\"solitary water waves\\" by Russell in 1834.J. S. Russell, Report of the fourteenth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1845): 311 These observations initiated the theoretical work of Rayleigh and Boussinesq around 1870, which finally led to the approximate description of such waves by Korteweg and de Vries in 1895; that description is known today as the (conservative) KdV equation. On this background the term \\"soliton\\" was coined by Zabusky and Kruskal in 1965. These authors investigated certain well localised solitary solutions of the KdV equation and named these objects solitons. Among other things they demonstrated that in 1-dimensional space solitons exist, e.g. in the form of two unidirectionally propagating pulses with different size and speed and exhibiting the remarkable property that number, shape and size are the same before and after collision. Gardner et al. introduced the inverse scattering technique for solving the KdV equation and proved that this equation is completely integrable. In 1972 Zakharov and Shabat found another integrable equation and finally it turned out that the inverse scattering technique can be applied successfully to a whole class of equations (e.g. the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger and sine-Gordon equations). From 1965 up to about 1975, a common agreement was reached: to reserve the term soliton to pulse-like solitary solutions of conservative nonlinear partial differential equations that can be solved by using the inverse scattering technique. = Weakly and strongly dissipative systems = With increasing knowledge of classical solitons, possible technical applicability came into perspective, with the most promising one at present being the transmission of optical solitons via glass fibers for the purpose of data transmission. In contrast to conservative systems, solitons in fibers dissipate energy and this cannot be neglected on an intermediate and long time scale. Nevertheless, the concept of a classical soliton can still be used in the sense that on a short time scale dissipation of energy can be neglected. On an intermediate time scale one has to take small energy losses into account as a perturbation, and on a long scale the amplitude of the soliton will decay and finally vanish. There are however various types of systems which are capable of producing solitary structures and in which dissipation plays an essential role for their formation and stabilization. Although research on certain types of these DSs has been carried out for a long time (for example, see the research on nerve pulses culminating in the work of Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952), since 1990 the amount of research has significantly increased (see e.g. ) Possible reasons are improved experimental devices and analytical techniques, as well as the availability of more powerful computers for numerical computations. Nowadays, it is common to use the term dissipative solitons for solitary structures in strongly dissipative systems.  Experimental observations of DSs  Today, DSs can be found in many different experimental set-ups. Examples include * Gas-discharge systems: plasmas confined in a discharge space which often has a lateral extension large compared to the main discharge length. DSs arise as current filaments between the electrodes and were found in DC systems with a high-ohmic barrier, AC systems with a dielectric barrier, and as anode spots, as well as in an obstructed discharge with metallic electrodes.

Image:Isoldissol2_en.gifAveraged current density distribution with oscillatory tails. * Semiconductor systems: these are similar to gas-discharges; however, instead of a gas, semiconductor material is sandwiched between two planar or spherical electrodes. Set-ups include Si and GaAs pin diodes, n-GaAs, and Si p+‚àín+‚àíp‚àín‚àí, and ZnS:Mn structures. * Nonlinear optical systems: a light beam of high intensity interacts with a nonlinear medium. Typically the medium reacts on rather slow time scales compared to the beam propagation time. Often, the output is fed back into the input system via single-mirror feedback or a feedback loop. DSs may arise as bright spots in a two-dimensional plane orthogonal to the beam propagation direction; one may, however, also exploit other effects like polarization. DSs have been observed for saturable absorbers, degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs), liquid crystal light valves (LCLVs), alkali vapor systems, photorefractive media, and semiconductor microresonators. * If the vectorial properties of DSs are considered, vector dissipative soliton could also be observed in a fiber laser passively mode locked through saturable absorber, * In addition, multiwavelength dissipative soliton in an all normal dispersion fiber laser passively mode-locked with a SESAM has been obtained. It is confirmed that depending on the cavity birefringence, stable single-, dual- and triple-wavelength dissipative soliton can be formed in the laser. Its generation mechanism can be traced back to the nature of dissipative soliton. * Chemical systems: realized either as one- and two-dimensional reactors or via catalytic surfaces, DSs appear as pulses (often as propagating pulses) of increased concentration or temperature. Typical reactions are the Belousov‚ÄìZhabotinsky reaction, the ferrocyanide-iodate-sulphite reaction as well as the oxidation of hydrogen, CO, or iron.R. Suzuki, Adv. Biophys. 9 (1976): 115 Nerve pulses or migraine aura waves also belong to this class of systems. * Vibrated media: vertically shaken granular media, colloidal suspensions, and Newtonian fluids produce harmonically or sub-harmonically oscillating heaps of material, which are usually called oscillons. * Hydrodynamic systems: the most prominent realization of DSs are domains of convection rolls on a conducting background state in binary liquids. Another example is a film dragging in a rotating cylindric pipe filled with oil. * Electrical networks: large one- or two-dimensional arrays of coupled cells with a nonlinear current‚Äìvoltage characteristic.J. Nagumo et al., Proc. Inst. Radio Engin. Electr. 50 (1962): 2061 DSs are characterized by a locally increased current through the cells. Remarkably enough, phenomenologically the dynamics of the DSs in many of the above systems are similar in spite of the microscopic differences. Typical observations are (intrinsic) propagation, scattering, formation of bound states and clusters, drift in gradients, interpenetration, generation, and annihilation, as well as higher instabilities.  Theoretical description of DSs  Most systems showing DSs are described by nonlinear partial differential equations. Discrete difference equations and cellular automata are also used. Up to now, modeling from first principles followed by a quantitative comparison of experiment and theory has been performed only rarely and sometimes also poses severe problems because of large discrepancies between microscopic and macroscopic time and space scales. Often simplified prototype models are investigated which reflect the essential physical processes in a larger class of experimental systems. Among these are * Reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems, used for chemical systems, gas-discharges and semiconductors. The evolution of the state vector q(x, t) describing the concentration of the different reactants is determined by diffusion as well as local reactions: ::\\\\partial_t \\\\boldsymbol{q} = \\\\underline{\\\\boldsymbol{D}} \\\\, \\\\Delta \\\\boldsymbol{q} + \\\\boldsymbol{R}(\\\\boldsymbol{q}). :A frequently encountered example is the two-component Fitzhugh‚ÄìNagumo-type activator‚Äìinhibitor system :: \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\tau_u \\\\, \\\\partial_t u \\\\tau_v \\\\, \\\\partial_t v \\\\end{array} \\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} d_u^2 &0 0 & d_v^2 \\\\end{array}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\Delta u  \\\\Delta v \\\\end{array} \\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\lambda u -u^3 - \\\\kappa_3 v +\\\\kappa_1u-v \\\\end{array}\\\\right). :Stationary DSs are generated by production of material in the center of the DSs, diffusive transport into the tails and depletion of material in the tails. A propagating pulse arises from production in the leading and depletion in the trailing end. Among other effects, one finds periodic oscillations of DSs (\\"breathing\\"), bound states, and collisions, merging, generation and annihilation. * Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau type systems for a complex scalar q(x, t) used to describe nonlinear optical systems, plasmas, Bose-Einstein condensation, liquid crystals and granular media. A frequently found example is the cubic-quintic subcritical Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equation :: \\\\partial_t q = (d_r+ i d_i) \\\\, \\\\Delta q + \\\\ell_r q + (c_r + i c_i) q^2 q + (q_r + i q_i) q^4 q. :To understand the mechanisms leading to the formation of DSs, one may consider the energy œÅ = q2 for which one may derive the continuity equation :: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\partial_t \\\\rho + abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{m} = S = d_r(q \\\\, \\\\Delta q^\\\\ast + q^\\\\ast \\\\, \\\\Delta q) + 2 \\\\ell_r \\\\rho + 2 c_r \\\\rho^2 + 2 q_r \\\\rho^3  & \\\\text{with } \\\\boldsymbol{m} = 2 d_i \\\\operatorname{Im}(q^\\\\ast abla q). \\\\end{align} :One can thereby show that energy is generally produced in the flanks of the DSs and transported to the center and potentially to the tails where it is depleted. Dynamical phenomena include propagating DSs in 1d, propagating clusters in 2d, bound states and vortex solitons, as well as \\"exploding DSs\\". * The Swift‚ÄìHohenberg equation is used in nonlinear optics and in the granular media dynamics of flames or electroconvection. Swift‚ÄìHohenberg can be considered as an extension of the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equation. It can be written as ::\\\\partial_t q = (s_r+ i s_i) \\\\,\\\\Delta^2 q + (d_r+ i d_i) \\\\,\\\\Delta q + \\\\ell_r q + (c_r + i c_i)q^2 q + (q_r + i q_i) q^4 q. :For dr > 0 one essentially has the same mechanisms as in the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equation. For dr < 0, in the real Swift‚ÄìHohenberg equation one finds bistability between homogeneous states and Turing patterns. DSs are stationary localized Turing domains on the homogeneous background. This also holds for the complex Swift‚ÄìHohenberg equations; however, propagating DSs as well as interaction phenomena are also possible, and observations include merging and interpenetration.

Image:DS_collision_ginzburg_landau.gif Image:DS_interpenetration_swift_hohenberg.gif  Particle properties and universality  DSs in many different systems show universal particle-like properties. To understand and describe the latter, one may try to derive \\"particle equations\\" for slowly varying order parameters like position, velocity or amplitude of the DSs by adiabatically eliminating all fast variables in the field description. This technique is known from linear systems, however mathematical problems arise from the nonlinear models due to a coupling of fast and slow modes. Similar to low-dimensional dynamic systems, for supercritical bifurcations of stationary DSs one finds characteristic normal forms essentially depending on the symmetries of the system. E.g., for a transition from a symmetric stationary to an intrinsically propagating DS one finds the Pitchfork normal form : \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{v}} = (\\\\sigma - \\\\sigma_0) \\\\boldsymbol{v} - \\\\boldsymbol{v}^2 \\\\boldsymbol{v} for the velocity v of the DS, here œÉ represents the bifurcation parameter and œÉ0 the bifurcation point. For a bifurcation to a \\"breathing\\" DS, one finds the Hopf normal form : \\\\dot{A} = (\\\\sigma - \\\\sigma_0) A - A^2 A for the amplitude A of the oscillation. It is also possible to treat \\"weak interaction\\" as long as the overlap of the DSs is not too large. In this way, a comparison between experiment and theory is facilitated., Note that the above problems do not arise for classical solitons as inverse scattering theory yields complete analytical solutions.

It is named after the Austrian-American mathematician Karl Menger. Definition Let x, y and z be three points in Rn; for simplicity, assume for the moment that all three points are distinct and do not lie on a single straight line. Let Œ† ‚äÜ Rn be the Euclidean plane spanned by x, y and z and let C ‚äÜ Œ† be the unique Euclidean circle in Œ† that passes through x, y and z (the circumcircle of x, y and z). Let R be the radius of C. Then the Menger curvature c(x, y, z) of x, y and z is defined by :c (x, y, z) = \\\\frac1{R}. If the three points are collinear, R can be informally considered to be +‚àû, and it makes rigorous sense to define c(x, y, z) = 0\\\\. If any of the points x, y and z are coincident, again define c(x, y, z) = 0\\\\. Using the well-known formula relating the side lengths of a triangle to its area, it follows that :c (x, y, z) = \\\\frac1{R} = \\\\frac{4 A}{ x - y   y - z   z - x }, where A denotes the area of the triangle spanned by x, y and z. Another way of computing Menger curvature is the identity : c(x,y,z)=\\\\frac{2\\\\sin \\\\angle xyz}{x-z} where \\\\angle xyz is the angle made at the y-corner of the triangle spanned by x,y,z. Menger curvature may also be defined on a general metric space. If X is a metric space and x,y, and z are distinct points, let f be an isometry from \\\\\\\\{x,y,z\\\\\\\\} into \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}. Define the Menger curvature of these points to be : c_{X} (x,y,z)=c(f(x),f(y),f(z)). Note that f need not be defined on all of X, just on {x,y,z}, and the value cX (x,y,z) is independent of the choice of f. Integral Curvature Rectifiability Menger curvature can be used to give quantitative conditions for when sets in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} may be rectifiable. For a Borel measure \\\\mu on a Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} define : c^{p}(\\\\mu)=\\\\int\\\\int\\\\int c(x,y,z)^{p}d\\\\mu(x)d\\\\mu(y)d\\\\mu(z). * A Borel set E\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} is rectifiable if c^{2}(H^{1}_{E})<\\\\infty, where H^{1}_{E} denotes one-dimensional Hausdorff measure restricted to the set E. The basic intuition behind the result is that Menger curvature measures how straight a given triple of points are (the smaller c(x,y,z)\\\\max\\\\\\\\{x-y,y-z,z-y\\\\\\\\} is, the closer x,y, and z are to being collinear), and this integral quantity being finite is saying that the set E is flat on most small scales. In particular, if the power in the integral is larger, our set is smoother than just being rectifiable * Let p>3, f:S^{1}\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} be a homeomorphism and \\\\Gamma=f(S^{1}). Then f\\\\in C^{1,1-\\\\frac{3}{p}}(S^{1}) if c^{p}(H^{1}_{\\\\Gamma})<\\\\infty. * If 0 where 0, and c^{2s}(H^{s}_{E})<\\\\infty, then E is rectifiable in the sense that there are countably many C^{1} curves \\\\Gamma_{i} such that H^{s}(E\\\\backslash \\\\bigcup\\\\Gamma_{i})=0. The result is not true for \\\\frac{1}{2}, and c^{2s}(H^{s}_{E})=\\\\infty for 1.: In the opposite direction, there is a result of Peter Jones: * If E\\\\subseteq\\\\Gamma\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}, H^{1}(E)>0, and \\\\Gamma is rectifiable. Then there is a positive Radon measure \\\\mu supported on E satisfying \\\\mu B(x,r)\\\\leq r for all x\\\\in E and r>0 such that c^{2}(\\\\mu)<\\\\infty (in particular, this measure is the Frostman measure associated to E). Moreover, if H^{1}(B(x,r)\\\\cap\\\\Gamma)\\\\leq Cr for some constant C and all x\\\\in \\\\Gamma and r>0, then c^{2}(H^{1}_{E})<\\\\infty.

Early life He was born on April 3, 1913, at his mother's home in Morikawa-cho, Hongo Ward, Tokyo City (now Hongo 6-chome, Bunky≈ç Ward, Tokyo Metropolitan District), as the eldest and only son of Shizue (n√©e Hayashi) and noted linguist and expert on the Ainu language Ky≈çsuke Kindaichi. The son resembled the father in his enthusiasm for learning and his mother in her secularism. When their son was born, his father had lost his job as a proofreader of the Sanseid≈ç encyclopaedia, so his family was in dire economic straits. His father eventually worked as a professor at Tokyo Imperial University. Family Haruhiko eventually married and had two sons: Masumi Kindaichi, a scholar of Russian, professor emeritus of Keio University, and current president of The University of Nagano; and Hideho Kindaichi, a linguist and a professor at Kyorin University. Work Haruhiko became known to the broader public with the publication of his book Nihongo (The Japanese Language) in 1957, which became a bestseller for its anecdotal approach to the nature of the language. He went on, with Susumu ≈åno, to become a familiar and honoured public intellectual, who could always be called on to help in discussions on radio and television concerning language.

In 1963 he played in 13 fixtures, and took a hat-trick against Kent at Blackheath. With Tony Lock having left Surrey, 1964 was Harman's first full season, and he took 136 wickets at 21.01. His innings figures included 8/12 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and 8/32 against Kent. Towards the end of the season his spin partner was the seventeen-year-old off-spinner Pat Pocock. However he found the high expectations aroused by his success imposed enormous pressure on him, and from that point his performances declined. He managed 63 wickets the following year, 50 in 1966 and only 18 in 1967, by which time he was no longer a first team regular. In 1968 he managed 48 wickets, largely thanks to a spinner-friendly pitch at Ilkeston, where he took 6 for 97 and 8 for 16 (including a hat-trick) against Derbyshire. But four further appearances produced only two more wickets and he was not retained on Surrey's staff at the end of the season.

John Laver, 1994, Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics. Supralaryngeal articulation remains the same as in normal speech. In normal speech, the vocal folds alternate between states of voice and voicelessness. In whispering, only the voicing segments change, so that the vocal folds alternate between whisper and voicelessness (though the acoustic difference between the two states is minimal).Language History: An Introduction. Andrew L. Sihler, 1999, John Benjamins, . Because of this, implementing speech recognition for whispered speech is more difficult, as the characteristic spectral range needed to detect syllables and words is not given through the total absence of tone.http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/project_larynx_summary.pdf More advanced techniques such as neural networks may be used, however, as is done by Amazon Alexa. There is no symbol in the IPA for whispered phonation, since it is not used phonemically in any language. However, a sub-dot under phonemically voiced segments is sometimes seen in the literature, as for whispered should.  Social role  A girl whispers. Whispering is generally used quietly, to limit the hearing of speech to listeners who are nearby; for example, to convey secret information without being overheard or to avoid disturbing others in a quiet place such as a library or place of worship. Loud whispering, known as a stage whisper, is generally used only for dramatic or emphatic purposes. Whispering also takes less effort to vocalize than a normal speech pattern. This is because less air needs to be used to vocalize the sound. However, while it takes less effort to produce a whisper, it tires out the vocal folds more quickly.  ASMR  In 2010, it was discovered that whispering is one of the many triggers of ASMR,. This phenomenon made news headlines after videos on YouTube of people speaking up close to the camera in a soft whisper, giving the viewer tingles. People often listen to these videos to help them sleep and to relax. In non-humans The prevalence and function of low-amplitude signaling by non-humans are poorly characterized. As such, it is difficult to ascertain the existence of whispering in non-humans. This is made more difficult by the specific physiology of human whispering. By sufficiently relaxing the definition of whispering, it can be argued any number of non-human species demonstrate whisper-like behaviors. Often these behaviors function to increase fitness. If whispering is more broadly defined as the production of short-range, low-amplitude acoustic signals, whispering is observed in myriad animals including non-human mammals, fish, and insects. If whispering is restricted to include only acoustic signals which are significantly different than those produced at high amplitude, whispering is still observed across biological taxa. An unlikely example is the croaking gourami. Croaking gouramis produce a high-amplitude \\"croak\\" during agonistic disputes by beating specialized pectoral fins. Female gouramis additionally use these fins to produce an acoustically distinct, low-amplitude \\"purr\\" during copulation. If whispering is restricted to include only creatures possessing vocal folds, i.e., mammals and some reptiles, whispering has been observed in species including cotton-top tamarins and a variety of bats. In captive cotton-top tamarins, whisper-like behavior is speculated to enable troop communication while not alerting predators. Numerous species of bats (e.g., spotted bats, northern long-eared bats, and western barbastelles) alter their echolocation calls to avoid detection by prey. Such a relaxed definition of whispering (i.e., production of short-range, low-amplitude acoustic signals which are significantly different than those produced at high amplitude) cannot be applied to humans without including vocalizations distinct from human whispering, e.g., creaky voice, falsetto. Further research is needed to ascertain the existence of whispering in non-humans as established in the larger article. =Notes=  See also  * Aspiration (phonetics) * Chinese whispers * Cocktail party effect * Egressive sound vs. ingressive speech * Whispering campaign * Whispering gallery * Whispery voice * Other forms of unvoiced vocalization: gasping, sighing and panting *Autonomous sensory meridian response  References   External links  * Functional Neuroanatomy of Human Vocalization: An H215O PET Study Category:Phonetics ","title":"Whispering"},{"id":"11830448","text":"Roger Hassenforder (born 23 July 1930 in Sausheim) is a former French professional racing cyclist from Alsace.

The audience memory curve is important when planning effective corporate communication. The audience memory curve is a principle that relates to the amount of information a person is able to retain and remember from a presentation depending on the time that the information is presented. ‚ÄúResearchers have found that people have a ‚Äòmemory curve‚Äô which enables them to recall what is presented or spoken in the beginning or end of the presentation and not much of what is presented or spoken in the middle of the presentation‚Äù.‚ÄúCommunications: Methods and Applications for Financial Managers.‚Äù Communications: Methods and Applications for Financial Managers, by James Carberry, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2017, pp. 93‚Äì93. Although an audience may attempt to listen to all of the data, examples, facts, and opinions in a presentation, the reality of the situation is that they can only take in and recall a small portion of what is said. The audience‚Äôs attention tends to be high when a presentation begins, but as it continues, the audience‚Äôs attentions may wander. Some people may tune in and out, others may daydream or become distracted. However, when a presenter nears the end of their speech with a phrase such as ‚Äòto wrap up‚Äô or ‚Äòin conclusion‚Äô, most audience members tune back in and listen intently attempting to find out what they had missed along the way.‚ÄúPresentation Skills.‚ÄùDevelopment of Life Skills-II, by Shalini Verma, Vikas Publishing House, 2015, pp. 68‚Äì69. The audience memory curve principle is especially important when it comes to communication techniques. Understanding how this principle works is necessary to delivering a memorable and successful presentation.  Ebbinghaus forgetting curve  When discussing the principle of the audience memory curve, it is worth noting the more well- known Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. This curve describes the decreased ability of the brain to retain memory over time. Ebbinghaus found the forgetting curve to be exponential in nature.‚ÄúEbbinghaus Forgetting Curve.‚Äù Psychestudy, 17 Nov. 2017, www.psychestudy.com/cognitive/memory/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve. ‚ÄúMemory retention is 100% at the time of learning any particular piece of information. However, it drops rapidly to 40% within the first few days ‚Äú.‚ÄúEbbinghaus Forgetting Curve.‚Äù Psychestudy, 17 Nov. 2017, www.psychestudy.com/cognitive/memory/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve. Understanding Ebbinghaus‚Äô forgetting curve is important when discussing the audience memory curve because Ebbinghaus also described the various factors that can affect the rate of forgetting, which is useful when discussing ways to combat decreasing interest of an audience during a presentation. These factors include the meaningfulness of the information, the way it is represented, and physiological factors, such as stress and sleep. Strategy In communication strategy, it is important to use direct approach in the beginning of a presentation. This is where the audience remembers most of the ideas presented. Use and deliver ideas in descending importance order. Leave the second most important message to last. If indirect approach is used then the ending of the presentation should conclude the main idea as a solution. There are a variety of techniques to battle the waning attention of an audience. According to Dr. Carmen Simon, the first step in giving an effective presentation is gaining the audience‚Äôs attention. True attention requires overcoming habituation. According to Simon, habituation is ‚Äúwhen you get used to stimulus and start paying less and less attention to it‚Äù.McGee, Maxwell. ‚ÄúUse Neuroscience to Create an Effective Presentation ‚Äì Poll Everywhere.‚Äù Poll Everywhere's Blog, 9 Oct. 2017, blog.polleverywhere.com/effective- presentation-techniques/. Overcoming habituation relies on stimulus internal variation, which Simon refers to as ‚Äúa fancy way of saying ‚Äòthe degree of change over time‚Äô‚Äù McGee). We tend to pay more attention to things that change, and ignore things that stay the same. Applying this information to a presentation means using more ‚Äòcuts‚Äô in the presentation. In other words, switching up the type of content and presentation style. Another way of overcoming habituation and gathering attention is the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine deals with pleasure and reward. ‚Äú‚ÄôWhen dopamine is present, your audience may be more likely to exert some effort in your favor,‚Äô Simon said, ‚Äòeven if it is just paying attention to you‚Äô‚Äù.McGee, Maxwell. ‚ÄúUse Neuroscience to Create an Effective Presentation ‚Äì Poll Everywhere.‚Äù Poll Everywhere's Blog, 9 Oct. 2017, blog.polleverywhere.com/effective- presentation-techniques/. The key to releasing dopamine is the anticipation of pleasure. Anticipation can be incorporated into a presentation in several ways including promising a reward to the audience or stating that you will need audience participation at some point. The audience memory curve is an important principle to understand in order to better communicate and present information to an audience. Understanding how people retain and connect with information will help a presented to take control of what an audience takes away from their presentation and is a huge skill to have as a presenter.

Life and Ministry Although born in Cornwall, his parents emigrated to Norway when he was four years old, and he grew up to be fluent in English and Norwegian. After he began preaching at age 17, he pastored several churches in the Methodist Episcopal Church of Norway. In 1905, as head of the Methodist City Mission in Oslo, Barratt travelled to the United States with the aim of raising funds to build new premises in Oslo. He was baptised in the Holy Spirit and spoke and sang in tongues on 7 October 1906 while staying in New York City, after hearing news of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles. He returned to Norway in December 1906 without funds or church support. Nevertheless, starting in 1907, he held revival meetings in Oslo at his newly formed \\"Filadelfia\\" assembly, which attracted international attention, and he became one of the prime movers of the Pentecostal movement in Europe. Lewi Pethrus from Sweden, Alexander Boddy from England and Jonathan Paul from Germany came to Oslo, and became convinced of the divine origin of the movement. They became leaders of the Pentecostal movement in their respective countries. Alexander Boddy visited Barratt early in 1907 and prevailed upon him to visit Sunderland. Barratt sailed from Norway in late August 1907, arriving at Newcastle in September. His preaching marked the beginning of the meetings at All Saints Church in Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, under the ministry of Boddy. On 13 September, Barratt wrote \\"the eyes of the religious millions of Great Britain are mow fixed on Sunderland.\\" Nevertheless his observation was not reflected in writings from the established church. Barratt returned to Norway on 18 October. Barratt continued to travel abroad, visiting Sweden, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Iceland and Denmark. The Methodist Episcopal Church terminated Barratt's membership in 1909, after which he travelled to the UK once more, preaching in Sion College, London and then returning to Sunderland for what had become an annual Pentecost celebration known as the Whitsuntide Convention. He then visited Bournemouth and stayed with Stanley Frodsham, another early Pentecostal pioneer and writer. He emigrated to America and from there he continued his oversees travel, visiting Palestine and India. Barrett was elected President of the Great European Pentecostal Conference in Stockholm in 1939. The vote was unanimous. Barratt died on January 29th, 1940 in Oslo and was buried there. Up to 20,000 people are said to have lined the streets for his funeral.

Bull Curry is recognized as the originator of the hardcore style predating even legends such as The Sheik and Abdullah the Butcher. Curry‚Äôs tumultuous career spanned five decades of in-ring action. Career =Early career= At the age of sixteen Curry joined the circus in order to help provide for his four brothers and sisters. His job at the circus was that of the ‚Äútough man‚Äù who took on all comers from the audience in a fight. He had 65 straight wins without anyone going past one 5 minute round. Then, in his twenties, Curry became a policeman in his hometown of Hartford, Connecticut, where he put his ‚Äútough man‚Äù background to good use in the streets, quickly earning him a reputation for toughness. It has been claimed that on one occasion a wild steer bull broke out of the Hartford stockyard and ran wild in the streets. Curry grabbed the bull by the horns and managed to wrestle it to the ground, however it is likely this was in fact nothing more than a fictional story created by wrestling promoters in order to give reason to his nickname of ‚ÄúWild Bull‚Äù that stuck with him for the rest of his life. Later on in the 1930s, Curry began wrestling in Detroit under promoter Adam Weissmuller (uncle of Johnny Weissmuller) who also trained him for his professional career. Curry stayed in Detroit for several years developing his brutal, hardcore style of wrestling that made him a top name in the territory. Curry was so well known that he even faced legendary heavyweight pro boxer Jack Dempsey in an exhibition match in 1940. Years later Curry would often claim that he knocked Dempsey out in the match but the truth is that Curry was stopped in the second round. =1950s and 1960s= In the early part of the 1950s Bull Curry relocated to Texas to work. Curry‚Äôs combination of unpredictable violence, unique look and intensity made Curry a big star in Texas more or less immediately upon arrival. Curry‚Äôs brawling style made him a success but it also kept the promoters from giving him the ‚Äúmain‚Äù title of the territory despite being the biggest draw in the territory. Instead of letting Bull Curry win the top title of the Texas territory the bookers created a brand new title to match Bull Curry‚Äôs Hardcore style of wrestling: the NWA Texas Brass Knuckles Championship which Bull Curry won in a tournament final over Danny McShain on March 6, 1953. Between 1953 and 1967 ‚ÄúWild Bull‚Äù Curry personified the Texas Brass Knuckles Championship as he held it 20 times defeating such names as Fritz Von Erich, Tony Borne, Waldo Von Erich, Louie Tillet, Killer Karl Kox and Brute Bernard for the title. In 1953 Curry would also briefly hold the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Lucas Pertano as well as the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship for three weeks but soon focused solely on the Brass Knuckles Title. In the 1960s Bull Curry‚Äôs son Fred Thomas Koury, Jr. took up wrestling under the name \\"Flying\\" Fred Curry. Unlike his father Fred was a clean cut, high flying face but the two Currys did team on a regular basis especially early in the younger Curry‚Äôs career. The two won the NWA International Tag Team Championship in 1964 and held it until 1966 as well as beating Nikolai and Boris Volkoff for the Ohio version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Later in his career Fred Curry struck out on his own more and more trying to get away from his father‚Äôs legacy of rule-breaking and violence to establish a legacy of his own. Fred‚Äôs attempts to get out of his father‚Äôs shadow never caused any problems between the two Currys. =Controversial persona= One of the trademarks of Bull Curry was his ‚Äúwildman‚Äù look with bushy eyebrows, maniacal facial expressions and insane eyes that could scare the crowd just by looking at them. In one case he scared a girl at ringside so badly she had to be carried from the ring in terror. The wild look coupled with his wild brawling style made Bull Curry one of the most hated rule-breakers in wrestling, he was so hated in places that riots broke out more than once as irate fans attacked Curry in the ring. *1955: a match between Curry and Ray McIntyre resulted in more than a 140 fans being taken to the hospital after a riot broke out. *1956: Curry was jumped by a fan who was displeased with Curry‚Äôs brutal treatment of local star George Becker. Curry broke the fans jaw with a single punch. *1958: During a match with Pepper Gomez in Galveston, Texas a fan struck Bull Curry with an iron pipe. Curry chased the fan out of the ring, catching up with him in the balcony where he beat him up. *1968: While wrestling Emil Dupre√© in Worcester, Massachusetts a fan jumped in the ring and jumped on Curry‚Äôs back. Curry punched the fan so hard that he was reportedly unconscious for two days. *Year unknown: During a match in Texas Curry got a bucket of yellow paint dumped over his head by a fan. *Late sixties: During a televised match, Curry used a cinder block on his opponent. The man went into the hospital for stitches. Curry was arrested and sentenced to jail for his actions. The only time he was allowed out was to wrestle, so for the next four weeks of televised matches, he was escorted to and from the ring in handcuffs by police, being cuffed and returned to jail when he was finished with his match for that week. =Retirement and death= Curry retired from wrestling in the mid to late 1970s well past turning 60 years old. He died on March 8, 1985.

The maximum load is the one that draws the greatest current, i.e. the lowest specified load resistance (never short circuit); * V_{min-load} is the voltage at minimum load. The minimum load is the one that draws the least current, i.e. the highest specified load resistance (possibly open circuit for some types of linear supplies, usually limited by pass transistor minimum bias levels); * V_{nom-load} is the voltage at the typical specified load. For a constant-current supply, the above equation uses currents instead of voltages, and the maximum and minimum load values are when the largest and smallest specified voltage across the load are produced. For switching power supplies, the primary source of regulation error is switching ripple, rather than control loop precision. In such cases, load regulation is defined without normalizing to voltage at nominal load and has the unit of volts, not a percentage. \\\\text{Load Regulation}(V) = V_{min-load} - V_{max-load}  Measurement  A simple way to manually measure load regulation is to connect three parallel load resistors to the power supply where two of the resistors, R2 and R3, are connected through switches while the other resistor, R1 is connected directly. The values of the resistors are selected such that R1 gives the highest load resistance, R1R2 gives the nominal load resistance and either R1R2R3 or R2R3 gives the lowest load resistance. A voltmeter is then connected in parallel to the resistors and the measured values of voltage for each load state can be used to calculate the load regulation as given in the equation above. Programmable loads are typically used to automate the measurement of load regulation.

Santa Maria in Organo is a Roman Catholic church in Verona, Northern Italy. History The church's origin dates to the 6th‚Äì8th century, at the time of the Ostrogoth and Lombard dominations in Italy. The original convent was destroyed in Napoleonic times. The church was rebuilt after an earthquake in 1117. It once faced a branch of the Adige River, now grounded. From the 14th century it was a parish depending from the Patriarchate of Aquileia, to which it belonged until its dissolution in 1756. In 1444 it was sold the Olivetan Benedictins, who held it until 1808. The monk Giovanni da Verona executed the tarsias of the wooden choir, and designed the bell tower, finished in 1533. In 1534 five bells were cast in the scale of F, the first peal in Italy. They are rung with Veronese bellringing art. Starting from 1547 a Romanesque-Gothic fa√ßade, in white marble, was begun, designed by Michele Sanmicheli; this has remained unfinished. Among the other possessions, the Abbey held the church of Santa Maria Maggiore of Gazzo Veronese. Interior The interior is on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles. It houses a rich collection of paintings, with works by Girolamo Savoldo, Domenico Morone, Francesco Morone, Antonio Balestra and Guercino among the others. Under the presbytery is the crypt, a relic of the High Middle Ages edifice. The columns maintain the 8th century capitals. It has works by Luca Giordano, Francesco Morone, and Antonio Balestra, along with the popular Muletta, a wooden sculpture from the 14th century, which depicts Jesus entering Jerusalem riding a mule.

It is desirable for a power supply to maintain a stable output regardless of changes in the input voltage. The line regulation is important when the input voltage source is unstable or unregulated and this would result in significant variations in the output voltage. The line regulation for an unregulated power supply is usually very high for a majority of operations, but this can be improved by using a voltage regulator. A low line regulation is always preferred. In practice, a well regulated power supply should have a line regulation of at most 0.1%.https://www.sunpower-uk.com/glossary/what-is- line-regulation/ In the regulator device datasheets the line regulation is expressed as percent change in output with respect to change in input per volt of the output.

Members of the Blennerhassett family represented Carlisle in almost every Parliament from the reign of Richard II to the reign of James I. This branch of the family settled in County Kerry during the reign of James I and its members frequently represented County Kerry and Tralee in the Irish House of Commons. The first Baronet's son, the second Baronet, was High Sheriff of Kerry in 1823. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baronet. He served as High Sheriff of County Kerry in 1820.

In September 2008, the school decided to pursue trust status, becoming a foundation school on 3 February 2009 and also a trust school, with partners University of Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight NHS Primary Care Trust, the Quarr Group, Solo Agency and Quay Arts. The school also introduced International Baccalaureate courses. As part of the reorganisation of the education system on the Isle of Wight, Island Innovation Trust (formerly Medina Innovation Trust), formed by the school's trust, was successful in their bid against Academies Enterprise Trust and again Island Innovation Trust without a hard federation to take over the school. In 2011, the school opened with the age range extended to Year 7 to Year 13. It is now one of 5 secondary providers on the Isle of Wight, with the school in a hard federation with Carisbrooke College. In January 2010, the current head Richard Williams announced he would be stepping down no later than Easter and moving on to become principal of an academy school in Kent, partly influenced by the school's re-organisation. As Medina High School, the school was made a specialist Arts College and received the Artsmark gold award in 2007. The school has won medals in local and national trampolining competitions including the British Schools Trampolining Competition in March 2009. Also, Medina took part in the White Air extreme sports festival held at Yaverland. The school shares a 6th Form Campus with Carisbrooke College on the former Nodehill Middle School site, known as Island Innovation VI Form Campus. The 2012 pass rates for the school were 32.5% 5+ A*-C including English and Maths for GCSE and 97.8% pass rate with 67% A* to C for A Level at Island Innovation VI, run by the college with Carisbrooke. Until his death on 18 March 2008, Anthony Minghella served as the school's patron. On 1 September 2014, Nathan Thomas left his post as head teacher of the school. Facilities The Medina Leisure Centre and Medina Theatre The school has the Medina Leisure Centre on- site, which houses a gym, climbing wall, swimming pools, tennis and basketball courts, a sports hall and the Medina Theatre. However, students are only allowed to use the majority of these facilities during lessons such as drama and physical education. Fusion The main entrance when it was known as Medina High School The school during an 'Arts Blast' week Fusion was a quarterly magazine produced by students at the school, targeting young people across the island and distributed islandwide. It was first published in summer 2007 as part of the school's 'Arts Blast' week and contained a documentary of the Isle of Wight Festival. 5 issues were published, with the first two issues supported by Creative Partnerships. The magazine was free and relied on advertising revenue from Island businesses.

It covers several acres in an industrial park near the suburb of Kwinana Beach. Electricity for the plant is generated by the 80 MW Emu Downs Wind Farm located in the state's Midwest region near Cervantes.

The complex features a walled garden and children's play area. History Statue of Dr Edward Parker Charlesworth, physician and life governor of the hospital from 1820 until his death in 1853 Robert Gardiner Hill The hospital's origins lie in a bequest by Dr Paul Parnell to establish an asylum in Lincoln. After delay caused by indecision by the management of the asylum, the project went ahead in 1817, and a facility designed by Richard Ingleman in the Greek revival style opened as the Lincoln Lunatic Asylum in April 1820. It was at the asylum that, in the 1830s, Robert Gardiner Hill, with the support of Edward Parker Charlesworth, pioneered a mode of treatment that suited \\"all types\\" of patients, so that mechanical restraints and coercion could be dispensed with‚Äîa situation he finally achieved in 1838. In 1839 Sergeant John Adams and Dr. John Conolly were impressed by the work of Hill, and introduced the method into their Hanwell Asylum, by then the largest in the country. Hill's system was adapted, since Conolly was unable to supervise each attendant as closely as Hill had done. By September 1839, mechanical restraint was no longer required for any patient.Edited by: Bynum, W.

Mary Barkas, a respected psychiatrist, worked as Medical Superintendent at the hospital between 1928 and 1933. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and, following the introduction of Care in the Community, closed in 1985. City of Lincoln Council acquired the hospital and operated it as an events venue until August 2016 when it sold it to R. W.

Kingston Park is within the City of Holdfast Bay and flanked by the neighbouring suburbs of Marino to the south and Seacliff to the north and east. Overview History The Kaurna people inhabited the area before European settlement. As per the Aboriginal oral history and dreamtime mythology, the Creator Hero, Tjilbruke, carried his dead nephew, Kulultuwi, from the spring to Jervis Bay. Above the spring on the cliff top is a lookout with views across the Gulf St Vincent, featuring the Tjilbruke Monument by South Australian sculptor John Dowie. The Kingston family, the namesake of this suburb, were early landholders in this area. George Strickland Kingston was deputy surveyor in command of the Cygnet which landed at Holdfast Bay on 5 November 1836. His son, Charles Cameron Kingston was instrumental in drafting the Commonwealth Bill of Federation. Flora and fauna The Kingston cliff face is home to 80 indigenous plant species, including harlequin mistletoe (Lysiana exocarpi) and sticky boobialla (Myoporum viscosum). A third of the indigenous coastal cliff vegetation is endangered or vulnerable. Bird, animal and insects include the mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum), the shingleback lizard (Tiliqua rugosa) and the trapdoor spider. Facilities The cliff face has three walking trails with a good level of fitness required and not accessible by wheelchairs. The northern rocky beach area to the south is ideal for fishing and exploring rock pools, while the beach at Kingston Park is usually calm and shallow for some distance. The Kingston Park Coastal Reserve, a small park with tennis courts, swings, barbecue and toilet facilities are located above the beach, with views out to the sea. The Brighton Caravan Park and Holiday Village is located in Kingston Park right next to the beach, and there is a road parking and caf√© adjacent to this. 2019: Repatriation of Aboriginal remains On 1 August 2019, the remains of 11 Kaurna people were laid to rest at a ceremony led by elder Jeffrey Newchurch at the Coastal Reserve. South Australian Museum Head of Humanities John Carty said the museum wanted to work with the Kaurna people to repatriate their ancestors, and would also be helping to educate the community about what it means to Aboriginal people.

Fa√ßade panel with St. Peter of Verona. View of the interior. Sant'Anastasia is a church of the Dominican Order in Verona, northern Italy. In Gothic style, it is located in the most ancient part of the city, near the Ponte Pietra. History The current church was started in 1280 and completed in 1400, designed by the Dominican friars Fra' Benvenuto da Imola and Fra' Nicola da Imola. It took its name from a pre-existing temple built by King Theoderic the Great upon which was built the actual church. Since 1307, it is in fact co-entitled to St. Peter of Verona, martyr and co-patron of the city. Consecrated only in 1471, until 1808 the church was held by the Dominicans. The 72 m tall belltower had four bells in 1460, the fifth was added in 1650. In the 1839, the 9 bells were cast and tuned in C; they are rung in Veronese bellringing art by a local team founded in 1776. The church is similar in structure to the Basilica of San Zanipolo in Venice. Fa√ßade The fa√ßade is divided into three vertical section corresponding to the nave and the two aisles in the interior. Unfinished, the fa√ßade is mostly in brickwork. In the centre of the middle section is a simply rose window. The 15th century portal has two doors, and is enclosed into a Gothic structure (1330) with arches supported by ornamental columns in red, black and white marble. The arches forms three lunettes: in the larger one is a representation of the Holy Trinity with two Angels, flanked by St. Joseph and the Holy Virgin. The Father sits on a Gothic throne with Crucifix on his knees and Christ on his side, surmounted by a dove. In the two smaller lunettes, directly over the portal, are portrayed the Bishop leading the Veronese people and St. Peter of Verona leading the friars, with the white-black banner of the Dominicans. The five splays of the Gothic arch are decorated with six chronological scenes of Jesus' life: the Annunciation, the Birth, the Adoration of the Magi, the Path towards the Calvary, the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The central column between the doors has high-reliefs with St. Dominic, St. Peter of Verona and St. Thomas. The architrave has three statues: the central and larger is Madonna with Child of Venetian school, while the other represents St. Anastasia and St. Catherine at the Wheel. The side sections of the fa√ßade, corresponding to the aisles, have large stainglassed mullioned windows, flanked by two square belfries. The hunchback, work by Gabriele Caliari. Fresco of Adoration of the Virgin by Altichiero da Zevio Interior The interior, on the Latin cross plan, is divided into a nave and two aisles, with crossed vaults, separated by six columns each; the latter are in white or red Verona marble, with Gothic capitals. The four columns over the high altar show the coat of arms of the Castelbarco of Trento, a family who extensively contributed to the church's construction. Notable is the funerary monument to Cortesia Serego, on the left of the apse, which was finished in 1432 by Vincenzo di Stefano da Verona. It portrays the riding figure of Cortesia, clad with an armor and holding a commanding wand. His horse stands upon the sculpted sarcophagus, which has always been empty. The fresco part represents the Annunciation and the Saints Peter of Verona and Dominic. The two stoups before the first two columns stands on two hunchback figures, one of which attributed to Paolo Veronese's elder son, Gabriele Caliari. The Pellegrini Chapel houses the late International Gothic fresco of St. George and the Princess, main work of Pisanello, as well as terra-cotta statues by Michele di Firenze, executed before 1436. A frieze by the latter, or by Pisanello, has now disappeared. The Pellegrini chapel also houses the grave of Wilhelm von Bibra. The church ends with a large apse. Exterior To the left of the church entrance, Guglielmo di Castelbarco, podest√† of Verona, built an arch that became his tomb (Arca) anticipating the more famous Scaliger Tombs.

Women and men Power Walk either a marathon (‚ÄúFull Moon‚Äù) or half-marathon (‚ÄúHalf Moon‚Äù), wearing brightly decorated bras to raise money for breast cancer causes. The event is held annually in London, Edinburgh and Iceland. Since the first MoonWalk was held in 1998 over 395,000 women and men have raised over ¬£133 million for the breast cancer charity Walk the Walk. Walk the Walk then grants money to other charities and organizations throughout the UK. Celebrity participants have included Claire Balding, Debbie Chazen, Charlie Condou, Liza Goddard, Jane Hill, Lorraine Kelly, Sally Lindsay, Nell McAndrew, Kirsty McCabe, Jojo Moyes, Paul O‚ÄôGrady, Sue Perkins, Tom Read Wilson, Aliza Reger, Gaby Roslin, Jennifer Saunders, Penny Smith and Sue Vincent. Many celebrities and designers have created spectacular decorated bras for Walk the Walk. These bras are put on display at exhibitions to raise awareness. The charity‚Äôs patron is HRH Prince of Wales and the charity‚Äôs ambassador is actress Harriet Thorpe.  Event History  In 1996 the charity‚Äôs founder, Nina Barough CBE, had a dream that she was Power Walking the New York City marathon in a bra to raise money for breast cancer. She decided to do just that and that year she and 13 friends walked together and raised ¬£25,000 between them. Two months later Barough found a lump in her breast and was diagnosed with breast cancer. Throughout her treatment she continued walking as a way of staying fit. After receiving the all-clear, Nina and a group of 50 people planned to walk the London Marathon to raise more money. Not all the team could get places so Barough organized her own walking event through London the night before the marathon was due to take place, handing the baton over to the walkers taking part in the official marathon. This is where the idea of a night-time walk and MoonWalk began. Over the years The MoonWalk has grown to include thousands of women and men, who gather together in a huge pink tent before setting off on their night-time challenges. In 2006 the first MoonWalk Scotland was held in Edinburgh - offering a picturesque route through the city and more distances including a back-to-back double marathon of 52.4 miles (\\"Over The Moon\\") and a 6.55 mile walk largely aimed at children (the \\"New Moon\\"). To date Walk the Walk has raised over ¬£21.5m through The MoonWalk Scotland, with most of the money raised staying in Scotland. The MoonWalk Iceland takes place at Lake Myvatn, Iceland, which because of its location and time of year is the only one of the overnight walks to take place in daylight. The route is rural, starting and ending at the lake's hot spring baths  Charities supported  Money raised by The MoonWalk has been granted to a number of different breast cancer causes including: *Breast Cancer Now for research which includes the Legacy Study, The Tissue Bank and The Generations Study. Most recently grants have been focused on secondary breast cancers. *Penny Brohn UK in Bristol, Breast Cancer Haven in London and Leeds, the Christie Hospital in Manchester, Maggie‚Äôs Cancer Centres in Scotland, all of whom support and care for people living with cancer *FACT in Gateshead for pre and post cancer care and support for the community *Tenovus, for mobile vehicles which travel to rural communities in Wales to provide cancer support, chemotherapy and lymphatic drainage *Walk the Walk has also supplied Scalp Cooling Equipment to 247 hospitals across the UK.

It also offered a paid analytics service to help businesses identify risk in their supply chains.  Overview  AMEE created an individual company profile for every business and organisation in the UK (over 3.6 million in total). Profiles are pre-filled with a range of financial and environmental data, including annual turnover, number of employees and annual carbon emissions. AMEE's data comes from a variety of sources. Where a company has not publicly declared its carbon emissions AMEE models its emissions with a series of algorithms. The models make use of data elements such as number of employees, type of business and geographical location. Companies are then ranked against industry peers based on their AMEE Score. All the data displayed on amee.com is free of charge and publicly available. Companies are free to edit and update the data that is displayed on amee.com. By reporting their environmental performance on amee.com companies demonstrate their commitment to transparency and to reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain.  AMEE Score  The AMEE Score is a business efficiency metric that rates environmental impact in terms of annual carbon emissions relative to revenue, expressed as a 1‚Äì100 score.https://www.amee.com/pages/score_method It helps enable direct comparison of the environmental efficiency of companies within the same industry sector, based on the UK 2007 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).  Background  AMEE was initially developed as a software project in 2005 by UK company Dgen and founder Gavin Starks. It enabled any climate campaign to use a common standard for Carbon-Footprint Profiling and Measurement. From 2007 AMEE was used for the UK Government's carbon calculator for its ‚ÄúAct on CO2‚Äù campaign against global warming. AMEE UK Limited was created in 2008 and then raised venture capital funding.

Amongst the several hundred organisations and churches that are members of the Global Connections network are many of the most prominent Christian faith-based organisations as well as many major organisations involved in relief and development. Global Connections sees encouraging churches to become more involved in global issues, including world mission, as one of its key purposes. As part of this, they seek to provide opportunities for church leaders to engage with the leaders of mission agencies. Global Connections also endeavours to bring together those who work in similar areas or to direct them to where they can find help on practical, legal or missiological issues. As part of this they organise approximately 20 forums, where members can meet with and learn from those who share similar concerns and can become involved in joint projects and co-operative actions.  History  The International Missionary Fellowship (IMF) was formed in 1941 when the need for consultation between mission leaders was frequently urgent due to the numerous crises resulting from the World War II. The IMF was primarily a prayer fellowship for interdenominational mission societies. The name was changed to the Fellowship of Interdenominational Missionary Societies (FIMS) in 1946. In the post-war period, the mission movement in Britain had to adjust to many changes across the world including the end of the colonial era. However, the FIMS lacked the authority and ability to make recommendations and provide guidance for the British mission movement. In 1958 a new agency, the Evangelical Missionary Alliance (EMA) succeeded the FIMS and a central office with part-time staff was established.  The present  In the year 2000 the organisation EMA (Evangelical Missionary Alliance) changed its name to Global Connections and membership was extended to include agencies whose mission focus was primarily the UK and churches involved in mission. This was done in response to continuing changes in the mission world. These included the growing size and development of the church outside the West and the false dichotomy between the West and the developing world. Mission was now from everywhere to everywhere. The UK itself was now becoming a mission field with mission partners travelling there from other nations. Furthermore, increasing ethnic diversity was changing the face of the UK. At this time many local churches were becoming involved in mission directly. The organisation wanted to reflect these profound and diverse changes and to develop the understanding of mission and its variety of expressions.  Associated networks  In the UK, Global Connections is associated with two other partner networks, the Evangelical Alliance and the African and Caribbean Evangelical Alliance. They try to work closely with these two partners on strategic issues relating to mission. Within Europe, Global Connections are members of the European Evangelical Missionary Alliance, which brings together networks with similar visions from across Europe. Through them, Global Connections has close links to the European Evangelical Alliance, which works in partnership with the EEMA. At an international level, Global Connections are members of the World Evangelical Alliance Mission Commission. They are also closely linked to the Lausanne movement and provide a link for them within the UK.
