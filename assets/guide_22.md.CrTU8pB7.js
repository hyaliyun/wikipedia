These ships have been retrofitted with large nets that are intended to catch fairings‚Äîto prevent the fairings from making contact with seawater‚Äîas a part of an iterative development program to create technology that will eventually allow rocket payload fairings to be economically reused and reflown. Ms. Tree was used for SpaceX Falcon 9 fairing recovery experiments on a number of occasions in 2018 and early 2019, while named Mr. Steven. The ship first successfully caught a descending fairing in its large net on June 25, 2019 during the STP-2 mission from a Falcon Heavy flight, coincidentally on its first fairing recovery voyage after the ship had been renamed Ms. Tree following a change of ownership.  History  The ship was originally built in 2014 for SeaTran as a platform supply vessel to support fast crew transport operations. The vessel was named Mr. Steven after Steven Miguez, the father of SeaTran CEO Blake J. Miguez. The vessel subsequently was chartered by SpaceX for an experimental program to provide surface marine \\"catch and recovery\\" operations for a test program attempting to bring the large Falcon 9 launch vehicle satellite fairingsseparated at high speed and high altitudethrough atmospheric reentry and parachute descent to the ocean surface in a controlled way, and then recover them for evaluation and potential reuse. Since satellite fairings are traditionally expended into the ocean, the fairings used for these tests were somewhat modified test articles. As part of that effort, Mr. Steven was fitted in July 2018 with four large arms which support an elevated horizontal net, similar to a giant trampoline or trapeze net. In July 2018, Mr. Steven was upgraded and refitted with a much larger net with an area of , four times the original net size. The upgrade included replacing the original rigid arms and fitting four new arms, which are each supported and positioned by two extendable shock-absorbing booms. Each arm can be removed and disassembled into six subsections. In June 2019, Mr. Steven was renamed Ms. Tree (a play on the word mystery), after being purchased by Guice Offshore (GO), a company with a long-standing contractual relationship to SpaceX as a provider of a variety of marine services. On June 25, 2019, SpaceX successfully caught its first fairing half on Ms. Tree in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast as part of the Falcon Heavy STP-2 mission. On August 6, 2019, Ms. Tree was used to successfully catch another fairing half from a Falcon 9 that successfully launched Amos-17. SpaceX has two complete fairing halves that have reentered from space and been recovered dry, without contacting the saltwater. It is important to maintain a clean environment inside the fairing to protect future payloads. In August 2019, SpaceX chartered the sister ship to Ms. Tree, the Ms. Chief (a play on the word mischief), as the second fairing catcher vessel so that it could be possible to retrieve both halves of the same fairing on a Falcon 9 launch. This second ship is also operated by Guice Offshore, and is therefore titled \\"GO Ms. Chief\\" on the ship sides. Ms. Chief was outfitted with a matching set of four wide arms and a catch net by October 2019, in preparation for dual simultaneous fairing recovery attempts. On 11 November 2019, during the Starlink L1 mission both ships were sent to sea but were recalled due to rough seas so a recovery was not attempted. On 16 December 2019, both ships were positioned in the Atlantic ocean for a recovery attempt, but both ships narrowly missed catching the fairing halves. On 29 January 2020, both ships were positioned for a recovery attempt for the Starlink 3 launch. Ms. Tree caught one fairing half, but Ms. Chief narrowly missed the other fairing half. On 20 July 2020, both fairing halves were successfully caught for the first time by both ships during the Anasis-2 mission.  Fairing reuse  SpaceX payload fairing before the launch of thumb During the first six decades of spaceflight, payload fairings were expended by atmospheric reentry and allowed to drop into the ocean as debris/flotsam. In 2018, SpaceX began flight test experiments with fairings descending from sub-orbital trajectories above the atmosphere on its Falcon 9 rockets. As a part of the SES-10 mission in March 2017, SpaceX successfully performed a controlled landing of the payload fairing into the ocean for the first time. SpaceX was able to recover the fairing half from the water after it landed, aided by attitude-control thrusters and a steerable parachute, gently on water. At the SES-10 news conference, the company announced its intent to land the fairings on a dry flexible structure, jokingly described by Elon Musk as a \\"floating bouncy castle\\", with the goal of reusing the fairings. The cost of a fairing is about $6 million which accounts for 10 percent of overall launch costs. The \\"bouncy castle\\" idea led to SpaceX contracting for the fast vessel Mr. Steven which has had modifications to facilitate a large net being strung between long arms that extend considerably beyond the width of the ship. Mr. Steven is equipped with a dynamic positioning system and was first tested after the launch of the Paz satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base in February 2018. The test was not fully successful because the fairing missed the boat by a few hundred meters but landed safely in the water before being recovered and taken back to port. All four attempts in the first half of 2018 to land a fairing on the recovery ship failed, despite fitting Mr. Steven with larger nets before the July 2018 attempt. In October 2018, to practice recovery outside mission situations, SpaceX performed drop tests of a fairing half from a helicopter with Mr. Steven below. The outcome of the tests has not been publicly released. On the ArabSat-6A mission on April 11, 2019, SpaceX used the recovery boats GO Searcher and GO Navigator to recover both fairing halves quickly after they landed in the sea; Musk declared the recovery successful and reused the fairings in a later Starlink mission. SpaceX used the same recovery method in May 2019 on another Starlink launch. A first successful fairing catch was made as part of the STP-2 mission on June 25, 2019.

Military parades, fun games, concerts and other events are held nationwide in major cities and provincial capitals in honor of the INAF's serving men and women and military veterans.  History of Armed Forces Day  The date of October 5 was chosen for the National Armed Forces Day in honor of the 1945 establishment of Southeast Asia's 5th oldest regular and standing armed forces per a government decree of the nascent Republic. The first ever parades, albeit in wartime conditions of the Indonesian National Revolution, was held in Yogyakarta in 1946, no parades were held in 1948 while a victory parade was held in 1949 in lieu of the anniversary parade, owing to the conclusion of military operations. It would be only in 1950 when the first regular parade was held in Jakarta, the national capital, to celebrate the 5th year of the armed forces and the adoption of the unitary status of the young country and they have been held annually ever since (with a break in 1965, when due to the aftermath of the events of the 30 September Movement a few days before the 20th Armed Forces Day, it was cancelled at the last minute but was made up the day after, parades were also not held in 1997, 1999 and 2016). From 1961 to 1998 the Indonesian National Police, as the then 4th branch of the armed forces, joined the parades, and flypasts have been held since 1951. The national parade's guest of honor is the President of Indonesia in his/her capacity as Commander in Chief of the National Armed Forces. While in Jakarta the parade has been held at the Halim Perdanakusuma AFB and formerly at the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex and the DPR/MPR Building complex. Since 2014, to place emphasis on the role of the armed forces in the modern era and in the modernization and expansion of its combat units the holiday parades have now been held outside of the capital and have also included a fleet review. = History of the celebrations since 1959 = * 1959 - First parade to feature Soviet made jet aircraft (Mig-17s and MiG-19s) * 1962 - First parade on television and to feature a drivepast of the S-75 Dvina SAM system * 1963 - First to feature combat helicopters and female armed forces personnel * 1967 - 22nd anniversary, Suharto's first parade as President * 1970 - 25th anniversary (silver jubilee) * 1975 - 30th anniversary (pearl jubilee) * 1979 - First parade to be broadcast in color television * 1980 - 35th anniversary, First parade to be broadcast via satellite nationwide * 1985 - 40th anniversary (ruby jubilee) * 1990 - 45th anniversary (sapphire jubilee), first parade also to be broadcast on private television stations aside from TVRI * 1995 - 50th anniversary (Golden Jubilee), first parade to be broadcast on cable television * 2005 - 60th anniversary * 2010 - 65th anniversary * 2014 - 69th anniversary, first parade to be held outside of Jakarta * 2015 - 70th anniversary * 2017 - 72nd anniversary, First parade to be broadcast in digital high definition * 2018 - 73rd anniversary, Simple Ceremony to honor those 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami victims * 2019 - 74th anniversary, Parade included Indonesia's UN Forces, Garuda Contingent * 2020 - 75th anniversary, simple ceremony and remote broadcasts to honor the Indonesian victims of the COVID-19 pandemic and in gratitude of the services rendered by the INAF's medical servicemen and women Expanded summary  As Armed Forces Day is the national armed forces holiday of Indonesia the celebrations in Jakarta or other major cities thus serve as a national event to mark the holiday. The celebrations begin as the parade commander (The commander is, in recent years, as in the case in 2015 and 2017, been led by a Lieutenant General/Vice Admiral/Air Marshal, usually the commanding general of Kostrad) arrives to take his place in the parade formation. The parade first renders honors to the Tri-Service Colour Guard (Pasukan Penjaga Lambang-Lambang Kesatuan) as the Paspampres Presidential Band plays honors music, if a massed colour guard unit is present the honors are the same. At 10:00 am the President and Vice President arrive together with the Minister of Defense in the dais, where they are received by the Commander of the Armed Forces. The parade then first salutes as the band plays Indonesia Raya, and then to the President as arrival honors are rendered. The PC then informs him/her of the commencement of the parade and ceremony and the readiness of the formations for the review. The president, riding in an open-top Land Rover, then inspects the formations with the PC and as the review ends, leaves the vehicle and returns to the dais, where he/she orders a minute of silence (mengheningkan cipta) in honor of all armed forces personnel who were killed in action and to deceased veterans of the armed services. When the band stops playing the Sapta Marga (Armed Forces Pledge) is recited in a rededication service, wherein 3 select officers renew the pledge on behalf of all servicing men and women of the armed forces. Afterwards, before the President would make the holiday address, he/she first awards 3 armed forces personnel with the following decorations, each per service branch, for merit and dedicated service to the nation and people in the armed forces: * Bintang Kartika Eka Paksi (\\"Army Meritorious Service Star\\") * Bintang Jalasena (\\"Navy Meritorious Service Star\\") * Bintang Swa Bhuwana Paksa (\\"Air Force Meritorious Service Star\\") Andika Bhayangkari is played after the address by the band, and this is followed by the PC receiving permission from the President to march off the parade in preparation for the march past later on, the departure honors then follow. = Order of the parade in order of inspection by the President =  Military bands in attendance  * Paspampres Presidential Band  Ground march past column  * Combined Field Music Unit of the National Armed Forces Academies System ** Corps of Drums Canka Lokananta, Military Academy ** Naval Academy Gita Jala Taruna Drum and Bugle Corps ** Air Force Academy Gita Dirgantara Drum and Bugle Corps * Tri-service Color Guard * Massed color guard * Joint Services brigade **Officers contingent ** Armed Forces Staff Colleges **Women's contingent ** Joint Service Military Police Command ** Presidential Security Force (Paspampres) ** Garuda Contingent * Corps of Cadets, National Armed Forces Academies System ** Military Academy ** Naval Academy ** Air Force Academy * Army ** Special Force Command (Kopassus) ** Army Strategic Command (Kostrad) ** Army Raider Infantry Battalions ** Army Infantry Battalions * Navy ** Marine Corps ** Navy Frogmen Command (Kopaska) ** 1st Fleet Command ** 2nd Fleet Command ** 3rd Fleet Command ** Military Sealift Command * Air Force ** Two battalions of airmen (one in flight suits and one in combat uniforms) ** Air Force Infantry (Paskhas) * Veterans contingent * Civil service contingent * Civil defense contingent (Firefighters, Maritime Security Agency) * Reserve and uniformed cadets contingent  See also  *Indonesian National Armed Forces *Armed Forces Day External links Indonesian National Armed Forces day parade 2017 Category:Armed Forces days Category:Public holidays in Indonesia Category:Military parades Category:Military of Indonesia ","title":"Indonesian National Armed Forces Day"},{"id":"56984047","text":"Gangajhari Railway Station () serves Gangajhari and surrounding villages in Gondia district in Maharashtra, India.

It was formed in the year 2000 in Santiago de Chile by saxophonist and composer Cristi√°n Crisosto. The ensemble's line-up is an expanded rock band that has varied in time but usually has a woodwind section as protagonists in addition to lead voices and a refined rhythm section.  Name  The name of the band, MediaBanda, means literally \\"half band\\" in spanish language, hinting to be half of a big band, however in Chilean Spanish, the term media is used as big, huge, as well as awesome and impressive. Therefore the meaning of MediaBanda might be \\"Awesome Band\\".  History  = Formation (2000‚Äì2002) = Cristi√°n Crisosto creator and main composer of the group A first band named MediaBanda and formed by Cristi√°n Crisosto, Jaime Vivanco, Pato Z√∫√±iga, Willy Valenzuela, Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez, Sergio Pinto, and Miguel Schain, began to operate at the beginning of the 1980s as a group that explored the fusion of rock, funk, jazz, and free improvisation, also inspired in Rock in Opposition movement. From this formation there was only one unpublished demo. However, when Crisosto and Vivanco joined the rest of the final members, decided to make new music and change the name to \\"Fulano\\", starting a great career from 1984 to 2015, leaving an indelible mark in the history of Chilean music. It is later to the album Trabajos In√∫tiles (Useless Works, 1997) by Fulano that Cristi√°n Crisosto began an ambitious personal composition project, which in the year 2000 is concretized by putting together a new band, with his wife Arlette Jequier (voice), their daughter Regina Crisosto (voice), and seven other young musicians; Santiago Astaburuaga, (bass), Christian Hirth (drums), Daniel Linker (piano), Diego Aguirre (guitar), Sebasti√°n Dintrans (guitar), Patricio Bracamonte (trombone), Marcelo Maira (flute and sax), taking up the previous name of MediaBanda. This is how the current Mediabanda was born. = First period (2003‚Äì2010) = After a long period of rehearsals and workshop work to put together the complex compositions of Crisosto, Mediabanda launched in June 2004 its first album entitled Entre la inseguridad y el ego (Between Insecurity and Ego), financed thanks to the support of Fondart with a concert in the theater of the Centro Arte Alameda. The album stands out for its great musical eclecticism, compositional complexity and richness of sound, in songs that walk with ease through rock, funk, salsa, afro-latin rhythms, pop melodies, jazz arrangements, avant-garde music and even at times, classical music. At the end of 2004, the faculty of the Escuela Moderna de M√∫sica awarded MediaBanda the prize for best band of the year, and Wik√©n magazine of the newspaper El Mercurio qualifies the group as the best new Chilean artist. As a result of the reception of the critics and the public, they are invited to participate in the 4th Providencia Jazz International Festival, sharing the stage with international artists such as Paquito D'Rivera, Yellowjackets, Lito Vitale and others. Later they would also act in Centro Cultural Matucana 100 next to Akineton Retard, between other presentations of the period. In April 2005 he won his second Fondart project, which included a national tour that took place during the months of October and November. In April 2006, they won for the third time a Fondart project to finance their second record production Dinero y Terminaci√≥n Nerviosa (Money and nerve endings) which was recorded in January 2007 and launched in June of the same year in two concerts at the Centro Arte Alameda. The album was a double CD where their style of fusion rock, jazz, and contemporary music develops, consolidating the group as one of the most important of the Latin American progressive fusion style. This time the composition was also open to Hirth and Dintrans, in addition to notable experimental improvisations from Jequier, Hirth and Astaburuaga. A week later, they embark on a trip to Europe for a month and a half, performing in various halls, auditoriums and festivals such as the Nuits du Sud Festival in Vence France, and others in Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria and Italy. Upon returning to Chile, they would perform at the Teatro Oriente next to Congreso and Akineton Retard. Later also with the experimental percussion group Code, in the same theater. In 2010 they released a new album called Siendo Perro (Being dog), with a new line-up which highlights the harmonic use of guitars as a replacement for the piano, and the incorporation of funk, and hard rock to the already avant-garde jazz-rock fusion. Siendo Perro was released without the voice of Arlette Jequier, what glimpsed the beginning of the breaks within the band and that led to a silence of more than two years. = Second period (2013 ‚Äì present) = In mid-2013, a new line up for the second age of MediaBanda was gathered, including six new members. In 2014 they participate in the celebration of the 30 years of the Fulano group, held at the Nescaf√© Theater of Arts together with Santiago del Nuevo Extremo, Pedro Foncea (from De Kiruza), and Angelo Pierattini (from Weichafe). During this period the group made a series of performances re-opening a large part of the repertoire, which also had the collaboration of Consuelo Schuster and Celeste Shaw in voices and that coincided with an important rotation of musicians in the base formation. During 2016 they composed and recorded their highly anticipated new album, Bombas en el Aire (Bombs in the Air), which premiered in January 2017 in a crowded Sala SCD in Plaza Ega√±a. The following week they are presented with great success at the Woodstaco Festival 2017 in Maule Region, before thousands of people, then continuing the album presentations in Valpara√≠so Region. It was recorded in CHT Estudios as a musical workshop experiment instead of the usage of scores that had been the fundamental support in the early days. During the months of July and August they went on tour to Mexico which included presentations in the Jalisco Jazz Festival in Guadalajara, the FestivAlterNativo in Quer√©taro, in addition to the cultural circuit of Mexico City. Back in Chile, they performed a series of presentations with other avant-garde bands such as Crisis (by Nicol√°s Vera and Cristi√°n Gallardo), Sube, Zet, Cola de Zorro, and Ojo de Pez among others. In January 2018, they participated in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Woodstaco Festival in Teno. Since late 2018 they are presenting the show \\"Mediabanda Plays Fulano\\", premiered on November 16, 2018 at the Teatro Oriente with guests such as Pablo Ilabaca (from Chancho en Piedra), Nicol√°s Vera, Consuelo Schuster, and Como asesinar a Felipes, paying tribute to the music of the mythical chilean fusion band Fulano, and in particular to the great maestro Jaime Vivanco, played by Tom√°s Ravassa on keyboards, in a show with new arrangements, including Aurelio Silva on guitar, and a staging that exudes energy and attitude. Given their success, they have continued to perform at venues such as the Valpara√≠so and Quilpu√© Jazz Festivals, Teatro San Joaqu√≠n, and La Batuta in √ëu√±oa. In January 2020 they release the first single from their upcoming new album entitled Maquinarias (Machinery) in tribute to Fulano, with the classic anti-athoritarian satire \\"Adolfo, Benito, Augusto y Toribio\\", at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights and in the context of the Social Outbreak.  Musical style  Cristian Crisosto's main influences have been American composer Frank Zappa and the European Rock in opposition movement. Weather Report, Return to Forever, Magma, King Crimson, Hermeto Pascoal, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk have also been important influences. Many other acts of different origins and styles have been significant too such as Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Charly Garc√≠a, and most notably Crisosto's former band Fulano. In addition to all these influences, there are those that each talented member of the band has had and that have served as essential contributions to the sound of the ensemble.

Limakatso Kendall. Nthunya, a Lesotho elder and matriarch, spent three decades as a domestic worker, supporting eleven people on her income. At the University of Natal, she met and befriended Kendall, an American writer on a Fulbright scholarship. Becoming friends, the two collaborated to record Nthunya's life story. Nthunya was born in 1930. Impoverished as a child, she often lacked clothing, shoes, and food, occasionally having to eat grass. She was able to freely attend Catholic grade school in South Africa, ultimately learning to read and speak eight languages. She modeled her life and faith on that of her Roman Catholic mother, but also maintained traditional beliefs in magic, wizards, and illness-causing spells. As an adult, Nthunya dealt with the death of her husband, and the murders of father, brother, and children. Despite these hardships, Nthunya maintained a \\"love of natural beauty, as well as her sense of humor, hope, and dreams.\\" In loosely connected episodes, including stories passed to her from her mother, Nthunya describes the difficult life facing many Basotho women, who must deal with a choice between the dangers, hardships, and degrading working conditions of city life as an indigenous African under apartheid, and the challenges of traditional rural life. In the Basotho community, women often face child mortality, forced marriage, domestic abuse and single parenthood. Illness and starvation are constant threats, and these are compounded by what Nthunya describes as the destructive force of jealousy in impoverished communities. Despite this, Nthunya chose in 1949 to move her family away from city life under apartheid to her rural homeland, so that they could learn the traditions of their people. The cultural conflict between city and rural life, and between Western and traditional culture, are a major theme of the book. Customs and rituals are a constant guiding force in Basotho life. The Basotho society is a patriarchal one: marriages are arranged without concern for women's preferences, and women are responsible for childcare and management of the household, but may receive little financial support. They live under the control of their husbands or male relatives, including their children. Women who are unable to bear children are stigmatized. With no power over men, women in Basotho society often oppress and victimize their sisters. However, Nthunya cherished the female friendships she had in Basotho society. Reviews Publishers Weekly called Nthunya's narration \\"eloquent\\", and described her writing as having a \\"dignified emotional distance... punctuated by her very human humor and pain.\\" Kirkus called the book \\"poignant and beautifully crafted\\", a \\"commanding and important work that will captivate readers with its unique voice, narrative power, and unforgettable scenes of life in southern Africa.\\" In Women's Studies Quarterly, Nthunya's book was favorably compared with two novels by African writers, So Long a Letter by Mariama B√¢ and Petals of Blood by Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, which also deal with themes of women's struggle in patriarchal societies, and that of widows in particular. The stories are said to speak \\"not only to the personal, not only to the Lesotho, not only to the African, but to the universal female experience.\\" References Category:Works by Lesotho people Category:Lesotho literature Category:Lesotho society Category:South African autobiographies Category:Books about apartheid Category:Non-fiction books about immigration Category:Books about indigenous rights Category:Books about women Category:1996 non-fiction books Category:1997 non-fiction books Category:Indiana University Press books Category:Books published by university presses ","title":"Singing Away the Hunger"},{"id":"56984171","text":"At least two ships of the French Navy have been named Tonkinois: * , an launched in 1917 and struck in 1936. * , a launched as HMS Moyola in 1942 and transferred to France in 1944.

It was designed by Henryk Stawicki from Cracow and built between 1980 and 1989.  History  The church is dedicated to Our Lady, Queen of Poland. The Painting of Our Lady of ≈Åukawiec (earlier: Our Lady of Tartak√≥w) from the 17th century is displayed in the main altar. Previously, the ≈Åukawiec parish church was Three Wise Man Church. However, due to the arrival of more and more believers, a decision was made to build a new church, thanks to the efforts of priest J√≥zef Kornaga. It was built in 1980-1989 according to the design of engineer Henryk Stawicki from Krakow. The church was consecrated by Bishop Marian Jaworski in 1990. The church is brick, built in a modern style. Its shape resembles a boat. In 1990, from the historic church of Epiphany, a miraculous Icon of Our Lady of ≈Åukawiec (earlier: Our Lady of Tartak√≥w) was moved to a new church and placed in the main altar. The church became the Sanctuary of Our Lady of ≈Åukawiec. The altar is located in a triangular niche, narrowing towards the top, supposed to resemble rays descending from the Heaven. In the middle there is a long, rectangular stained-glass window that reaches the roof. On the left side of the altar there is a door to the sacristy, and on the right to the Chapel of St. John Paul II. On May 17, 2011, Bishop Wac≈Çaw Depo dedicated the new elevation of the church and the presbytery. In 2013, thanks to the efforts of Archbishop Mieczys≈Çaw Mokrzycki a chapel of John Paul II was made in the church. Archbishop Mieczys≈Çaw Mokrzycki was the personal secretary of John Paul II. He made the dedication of the chapel. Thanks to him in the chapel were the relics of the Pope, in the form of a strand of hair, which was placed in a kneeler, and in specially prepared cases there were cassock, piuska, chasuble and chalice. In 2016, on the occasion of the anniversary celebrations connected with the 25th anniversary of the coronation of the Miraculous Icon of Our Lady of ≈Åukawiec by John Paul II, a new, huge main altar was made. The miraculous Icon of the Blessed Mother was placed there on June 6, 2016 after renovation. The consecration of the new altar was made by archbishop Mieczys≈Çaw Mokrzycki, who came from ≈Åukawiec, during a solemn mass on June 8, 2016. The altar was designed by Bogus≈Çaw Kulka and his wife. Masonry work was done by Jerzy Malarczyk, and woodwork by J√≥zef Majerczyk. Anita Kurasi≈Ñska painted a picture referring to the parish's call - Epiphany.

The CCRLS offices are located on the campus of the Chemeketa Community College in Hayesville, an unincorporated suburb of Salem, Oregon. The Cooperative works in tandem with the member libraries to determine services, policies, and procedures. The organization is governed by the College Board of Education, with input from the CCRLS Advisory Council, made up of one lay member from each county and one representing the rural areas, five library directors, and one city manager. Although considered a public library by the State of Oregon, CCRLS has no holdings of its own, but operates as a service overlay coordinating 16 independent and locally owned libraries into a cohesive system able to provide service to all citizens of the District. A map of the CCRLS district boundaries, showing individual library service areas, unserved areas, and detailing the CCRLS funding structure. History In 1972, a $12,000 Library Services and Technology Act grant was given by the Oregon State Library to the Mid-Willamette Valley Council of Governments to fund a study of the library needs of citizens in the tri-county area surrounding Salem, Oregon. At that time, statistics showed that of the 240,500 residents of the area, 100,000 did not have local library service. The plan that developed out of this study recommended implementation of five basic services: a bookmobile, courier service between libraries, a district-wide library card, provision of reference and information service to smaller libraries, and a film circuit service. Unable to fund a bookmobile in the first year of operation, a books-by-mail service was implemented, instead. Initial funding was provided by a 1973 Library Services and Construction Act grant. At that time, the Chemeketa Community College administration was designated the fiscal agent for the grant money funding the new Library Service. The Cooperative began operating in 1974, and in its first two years provided library service to 41,800 previously unserved, rural users. In 1975, special legislation (Oregon Senate Bill 160) authorized community college districts to establish public libraries, clearing the way for CCRLS to operate as a department of Chemeketa Community College. During its first decade of existence, CCRLS was funded through a series of levies. The Service was highly visible to the public because of the necessity to approach the voters every few years for funding. Services changed in a minor way, with books-by-mail eventually being deleted as a less cost effective service. In 1985 the Chemeketa District voters approved a tax base for the College, a portion of which was dedicated to CCRLS. This created (before the years of property tax limitations), the first stable funding for a public library multi- jurisdictional system in the State of Oregon. This funding allowed CCRLS to pursue library automation, and for the first time, the CCRLS member libraries were linked by a computer network and integrated library system that allowed library users to search all 18 libraries' catalogs at one time, and request material from any of those locations to be delivered to their home library within days. CCRLS today CCRLS courier truck at the Dallas 4th of July parade Current CCRLS services include: reimbursement to cities for serving non-city patrons, courier service among libraries, lost book reimbursement, an integrated automated system, net lending reimbursement, a rotating collection of bestsellers for small libraries, and a pass-through grant from State funding for children's services. All direct services to patrons, including bookmobile services, have been discontinued. Instead, CCRLS provides greater service to the member libraries in the form of computer networking and equipment, centralized software administration and support, cataloging services, and payment for numerous online services such as downloadable audio and ebooks, readers' advisory services, language learning software, and access to online databases available through the Oregon State Library.

Early life and education  Hinnant grew up in Old Asheboro neighborhood in Greensboro, North Carolina. Hinnant received a Bachelor of Art's degree from North Carolina A&T; University and attended at UNC Greensboro to study visual art. After college he moved to New York City and worked for the printmaker Josef Werner. Career In 1988 Hinnant exhibited work based on the 13th century Fibonacci numbers and Lucas Pacioli's treatise. He began studying Sacred Geometry formally in 1989 with his mentor, inventor and physicist Robert L. Powell, Sr. In the 1980s Hinnant introduced fractal mathematics, the Golden Ratio, the Logarithmic Spiral, Sacred Geometery and most currently STEAM concepts into his work to explore metaphysical ideas. The ancient architectures in Egypt, India, Rome and Greece that use these concepts were his original influences, unpacking \\"pre-material template of energies,\\" he said. Hinnant also has referenced Buckminster Fuller, Leonardo da Vinci, Frank Lloyd Wright and M.C. Escher as inspirations because of their use of geometry and math in making their artworks. Part of his objective is to catalyze dialogue through and around his work, connect these concepts to human relationships and encouraging education around the golden proportion. In 1991 Hinnant was a founding member of the African American Atelier in Greensboro, of which he was a member of its first board. In 1999 he was a featured artist in Round 10 of Project Row Houses. His work was on display at Fayetteville Museum of Art in 1998 and 2006. In 2009 his work was in a two-person show with John Hiigli about math and structure. In 2011 Hinnant's work was included in an exhibition about mathematics through art at Antioch College. This exhibition also included work by Sol LeWitt, Karen Finley, DJ Spooky, Dread Scott, and John Sims. In 2014 Hinnant's work was included in an exhibition about the golden ratio at the Saugerties Performing Arts Factory in New York. His work was also in an exhibition at The National Center for the Study of Civil Rights and African American Culture at Alabama State University. His work was included in the Museum of the Golden Ratio, a virtual museum of artworks. In 2015 there was a survey of Hinnant's work at North Carolina Central University Art Museum, the Winston-Salem State University and the Cameron Museum of Art in Wilmington, NC. In his exhibit at Winston-Salem State University's Diggs Gallery included a tribute installation called Inquiries and Destinations: A Sound Room for Terry Adkins, inspired and dedicated by the late artist. In 2016 over forty of Hinnant's works, spanning 35 years, were featured at the Rosenthal Gallery at Fayetteville State University. His work was also included in an exhibition called African American Abstraction at City Gallery East in Atlanta that same year. In 2017 Hinnant created two-story public sculpture, called Monument to Leadership, for Fayetteville State University's 150 year anniversary. The piece represented the pioneering vision of the school. He was commissioned in 2018 by the city of Greensboro to design an artwork on the Bragg Street Downtown Greenway. Hinnant's work is in public collections at the Atlanta International Airport, Wachovia Bank, Capital Broadcasting Company in Raleigh, NationsBank in Charlotte, Miller Brewing Company, Duke University Medical Center, Phizer Pharmaceuticals, Brandywine Workshop Collection and the Cumberland County Public Library among others. His work is also featured at the Piedmont Triad International Airport. Hinnant was a 1994 recipient of the North Carolina Artist Fellowship. = Mandalas = Many of Hinnant's works explore mandalas, a visual spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. He uses circles, lines, angles, polyhedrons and color and tint to explore mandalas in his drawings, paintings and sculpture which are often installed together. = Together We Rise = Hinnant's city-commissioned eleven-foot sculpture called Together We Rise was installed in Corpening Plaza, Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 2014. He used geometry as a metaphor for the collaboration and harmony of the two different cities. The piece is stacked isosceles triangles made of stainless steel and commemorates the 100th anniversary of the two communities of Winston and Salem uniting in 1913. The surfaces of the triangles include text and images such as quotes by Maya Angelou and Margaret Mead and women activists who supported racial equality during the late 1800s, that helped to unpack its conceptual themes.

She learned photography from him and took over his studio after his death in 1954. Her clients included the Ogilvy department store, Holt Renfrew, the Fur Traders Association, Valentino and Chanel. She also photographed the cast of the satirical play My Fur Lady for McGill University. In 1966, Ogilvy presented a retrospective of her work.

Sauer worked closely with her models and, as a woman, she felt that the models interacted with her differently than they would have with a male photographer. In 1965, with Florence King Blackwell, she produced a fur fashion and tourist report for Montreal magazine called The Beauties of Montreal.

It is found in all the world's oceans in the temperate and tropical zones. It is subject to some commercial fishing activity in the Mediterranean Sea. Description Aristaeomorpha foliacea is a large decapod crustacean, a shrimp or prawn which has a firm and, flexible and light red exoskeleton and black eyes. In mature females black colour of the black ovaries darkens the dorsal part of the abdomen. There is a slight keel along the dorsal midlines of the third segment which becomes more probounced on the next three segments, ending in a sharp posterior point. It has long pleopods, antennal, hepatic and branchiostegal spines on its carapace, a very short upper antennal flagella, strong spines to the rear of the midpoint on the third to sixth abdominal segments, a telson with four small mobile lateral spines, the females have an open telicum and the species shows secondary sexual dimorphism in body size and the length of the rostrum with the adult females being larger and having a longer rostrum, extending well beyond the antennal scale. In the males the rostrum is short and does not reach the tip of the antenna's peduncle. There are 6-12 upper teeth on the rostrum, including 2 on the carapace. The largest females have a total length of and the largest males grow to . The more common measurements for females are body length and for males . Distribution Aristaeomorpha foliacea is found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic, the western Atlantic and the Indian Ocean into the Western Pacific from Japan to Australia and New Zealand as far east as Fiji. This distribution reflects the origin of A. foliacea in the Tethys Ocean during the Mesozoic, which covered an area approximately covering the present Caribbean Sea to the Indian Ocean and included areas which are now in the Mediterranean. Its expansion into adjacent areas of the Pacific is a later increase in distribution. The distribution of this species in the Mediterranean is rather patchy and the largest concentrations are in the central and eastern basins. Habitat and biology The giant red shrimp is a deep-water. benthopelagic species and has a reported depth distribution of 120‚Äì1300 m, generally on muddy bottoms, in the Mediterranean it shows a preference for quite deep waters, mainly 500-800m, but it is more likely than related species to be found in shallower waters. It is known to gather in large aggregations in submarine canyons and trenches along the continental slope. Only a few individuals reproduce in their first year. The development of the gonads starts during the winter and the shrimps reach sexual maturity in their second summer. Sexually mature males have an extended reproductive capacity and are able to mate throughout the year, however the females mature seasonally. In the Strait of Sicily the females maturate and spawn from spring until autumn, with a peak in summer- autumn. This species gathers in shoals when mating and spawning. The eggs are released into the sea but the larval and juvenile stages are little known. This species is an opportunistic carnivore and scavenger with a high diversity in consumed prey types, the analysis of stomach content found both strictly benthic and pelagic prey . It is likely that this species undertakes diel migrations which are related to its feeding behaviour, during the day its prey consists of benthos while during the night it prets on animals higher in the water column. Recorded prey include crustaceans, bony fish, cephalopods siphonophores, gastropods, bivalves, polychaetes and foraminiferans. In the Straits of Sicily the main crustacean prey are Plesionika and Pasiphaea spp., especially Pasiphaea sivado. Also in the Straits of Sicily cephalopods are relatively more important in its diet when compared to giant red shrimp from other areas, making A. foliacea a significant contributor to the juvenile mortality of species such as Heteroteuthis dispar in the food webs of the central Mediterranean. Giant red shrimp also change their feeding behaviour seasonally, siphonophores of the family Diphyidae are important in the spring while benthic gastropods are an important food source in autumn. There appears to be a correlation between increased feeding in the Spring and increased reproductive activity. In the winter this species seems to eat more food but the food is of lower quality. Fisheries Aristaeomorpha foliacea is an important target species for bottom otter trawlers operating on the continental slope in the Strait of Sicily where is pursued by boats from Tunisia, Malta and Sicily. it is also a quarry species off Venezuela and Madagascar. A. foliacea is marketed fresh or frozen.

Route  The route, which runs in two partly winding circles over an area of about one hectare, is about long. The tracks are laid on a concrete foundation with a camber in the bends. This is a complex construction, which is rare in garden railways, as the tracks are usually laid as in the raw-model in a ballast bed. With financial support from a local foundation, the association succeeded in 2017 to build a steel bridge, which is also used as a track underpass. The club regularly organizes public driving days between April and September, which attracts mainly local families for leisure activities.

Parasite species‚Äô body size increases with host species‚Äô body size Launcelot Harrison, an Australian authority in zoology and parasitology, published a study in 1915 concluding that host and parasite body sizes tend to covary positively, a covariation later dubbed as 'Harrison's rule'. Harrison himself originally proposed it to interpret the variability of congeneric louse species. However, subsequent authors verified it for a wide variety of parasitic organisms including nematodes, rhizocephalan barnacles, fleas, lice, ticks, parasitic flies and mites, as well as herbivorous insects associated with specific host plants. The variability of parasite species‚Äô body size increases with host species‚Äô body size Robert Poulin observed that in comparisons across species, the variability of parasite body size also increases with host body size. It is self-evident that we expect greater variation coming together with greater mean body sizes due to an allometric power law scaling effect. However, Poulin referred to parasites‚Äô increasing body size variability due to biological reasons, thus we expect an increase greater than that caused by a scaling effect. Recently, Harnos et al. applied phylogenetically controlled statistical methods to test Harrison's rule and Poulin's s Increasing Variance Hypothesis in avian lice. Their results indicate that the three major families of avian lice (Ricinidae, Menoponidae, Philopteridae) follow Harrison's rule, and two of them (Menoponidae, Philopteridae) also follow Poulin's supplement to it. Implications The allometry between host and parasite body sizes constitutes an evident aspect of host‚Äìparasite coevolution. The slope of this relationship is a taxon- specific character. Parasites' body size is known to covary positively with fecundity and thus it likely affects the virulence of parasitic infections as well.

An ascent of the Sonnenspitze is one of the most popular tours of the Mieming Chain.  Location  The Sonnenspitze lies south of the village of Ehrwald on the north-westernmost end of the Mieming Chain. To the west lies the village of Biberwier, to the east is the 1,657 m high lake of Seebensee. To the south over the col of Biberwierer Scharte (2,000 m) is the Wampeter Schrofen (2,520 m).  Ascents  The summit may be ascended from the Coburger Hut (1,917 m) on an easy, but in places exposed climb (in places UIAA II) up its south side. The way is marked and secured with anchors and several pitons as intermediate belay points. In places the waymarks are hard to spot, which is why a good sense of direction for the ascent is essential. At the top there is another very narrow and very exposed summit ridge to cross in order to get to the summit cross. This absolutely requires a head for heights. Another ascent runs from the Seebensee along the northeast ridge to the top. It can be used as a descent when crossing. It runs for long sections through steep, grassy slopes and the uppermost 100 metres in height are a UIAA grade II climb in places. This section too is well marked in places and protected with new belays. Several climbing routes run along the south ar√™te and up the west face.  Literature  * Rudolf Wutscher: Mieminger Kette.

It is located in the Mieming Range in the Austrian state of Tyrol and lies only a few metres in height above the lake of Drachensee. The accommodation is generally open from June to early October and there is a winter room.  History  The construction of the hut goes back to a proposal by the Munich alpinist, Ferdinand Kilger, in 1890. This was taken up in 1895 by the Coburg branch of the German Alpine Club, a branch which had been founded in 1879. In 1901 the first hut was finished and, in the years that followed, it was given a water connexion (the \\"drinking quality water\\" was drawn from the Gr√ºnsteinsee, a lake which has now dried out), an electrical generator and, in 1908, a telephone line. After the First World War the building was extended for the first time and, in 1962, the material ropeway was built. For the 75th anniversary of the hut a new toilet block was built. Other renovation and building measures followed in the 1980s, after the responsible district author in Imst declared the building as unsound and a fire risk. In the 1990s, electricity and water supplies and drainage and waste were brought up to new environmental standards.Hans Ross, Fritz Weidmann: Lieblingskind ‚Äì Sorgenkind. 100 Jahre Coburger H√ºtte.

This variant is also only suitable for experienced mountaineers (Klettersteig grade D+), it has cable protection in very exposed terrain. The whole journey takes 3 hours. = Ehrwalder Alm = The simplest way to reach the hut is to climb up to the Ehrwalder Alm (1,502 m) from the village (1,000 m), using the Ehrwalder Almbahn (1,502 m) to assist in gaining height. There is then a small alm road which passes the Seebenalm and Seebensee in narrow zigzags to the Coburger Hut (2 hours from the Ehrwalder Alm). = Immensteig = The Immensteig branches off the path to the Ehrwalder Alm 300 metres above the valley station of the Ehrwalder Almbahn. It initially crosses the hay meadows of the Oberen M√§hder and then the eastern foot of the Seeben rock faces not far from the Immen Waterfall on a route that is protected by cable in places. At the Ganghofers Rast shelter it joins the track from the Ehrwalder Alm to the Seebenalm.

She was honored for her social service work as a member of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 and received the gold Hummingbird Medal from Trinidad and Tobago in 1976. Early life Gema Wellesley Julumsingh, a Dougla, was born in 1910 in Curepe, when Trinidad was part of the British West Indies to Florence (n√©e Arindell) and Julumsingh, an educated man of Indian heritage. Her mother, of White Scottish and Afro-Caribbean heritage died when she was around two years old and her father sent Gema and her younger sister to live with her maiden aunt, Ada Arindell, in Newtown, Port of Spain. She attended a private elementary school, run by Miss Moore and took violin lessons. At age thirteen, she began attending Bishop Anstey High School, where she passed her Junior Cambridge Examination, earning a distinction in geography. She left school at fifteen and married at All Saints Church in Port of Spain the following year, with John Dyal Ramkeesoon, a priest at St Agnes Anglican Church in Saint James. Career Influenced during her schooling by Beatrice Greig, a white activist, but one who spoke about the empowerment of Indo-Trinidadian women, Ramkeesoon became involved in the Cedros Bees, in 1926. The group was a mentoring program for young girls. After her marriage, as the wife of a clergyman, she was required to assist in parish activities. Joining the Mother's Union, she became the first local president of the organization. She joined the Coterie of Social Workers, founded by Audrey Jeffers and was one of the few Indo-Trinidadian women involved in the organization. Ramkeesoon worked to improve the relationship between Afro- and Indo-Caribbean women, as both groups were often ignored by mainstream feminist groups. The group participated in campaigns for women‚Äôs right to education, public office, and divorce, but also provided community assistance to those in need, such as establishing homes for the blind and school feeding programs. Ramkeesoon campaigned against discrimination based on skin color, a distinct prejudice from racism as it is based on biases against people of varying shades within their own racially identified communities, and in 1949 co-founded the Indo- Caribbean Cultural Council with Patrick Solomon, to find means for the two largest ethnic groups in the country to work together. She participated in and led social work conferences internationally; such as the 1949 Social Welfare Conference held in Jamaica, the 1950 Anglican World Conclave in London, and the 1953 Bridgetown meeting of the Barbados Women's Alliance, which she chaired. Ramkeesoon was in favor of regional cooperation and was a proponent of the development of the Federation of Social Welfare Workers in 1950, proposed to unite women across the British West Indies in their projects to improve their communities. In 1956, she was one of the women considered for appointment to the Senate of the West Indies Federation. Among her many contributions, Ramkeesoon served as chair of the Women's Prison Visiting Committee; was Executive Director of the YWCA; served as a president of the Women's Corona Society; was the secretary of St. Mary's Home in Tacarigua and of the Day Nursery Association; and served as secretary and treasurer of Bishops Centenary College of Port of Spain She was honored as a member of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 and was awarded the golden Hummingbird Medal from Trinidad and Tobago in 1976 for her social service work. In 1989 the Oral and Pictorial Records Programme of the University of the West Indies selected her as one of the pioneers of the women's movement to be interviewed. The five audio cassettes of the interview conducted by Maureen Cain are held in the Alma Jordan Library, on the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies. Death and legacy Ramkeesoon died on 1 March 1999. In 2013, she was honored by the University of the West Indies at its 20th Anniversary Conference on Gender Transformations in the Caribbean as one of the pioneers of feminism and human rights activism in the region.

The painting features a young kitchen maid in a Hollandish kitchen, taking a break from her work. The work was popular, and Chardin had made four different copies; with three of them present in various collections in the modern day. Background Chardin was born in Paris, the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city. Chardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731. According to one nineteenth-century writer, at a time when it was hard for unknown painters to come to the attention of the Royal Academy, he first found notice by displaying a painting at the \\"small Corpus Christi\\" on the Place Dauphine. Van Loo, passing by in 1720, bought it and later assisted the young painter. Upon presentation of The Ray in 1728, he was admitted to the Acad√©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The following year he ceded his position in the Acad√©mie de Saint- Luc. He made a modest living by \\"produc[ing] paintings in the various genres at whatever price his customers chose to pay him\\", and by such work as the restoration of the frescoes at the Galerie Fran√ßois I at Fontainebleau in 1731. In November 1731 his son Jean-Pierre was baptized, and a daughter, Marguerite-Agn√®s, was baptized in 1733. In 1735 his wife Marguerite died, and within two years Marguerite-Agn√®s had died as well. Subject and composition Chardin's pigments are granular, his palette earthy, and his handling is thick. The light of the painting has been described as subdued, with nothing being sudden or jarring. There is a superficial reference to Hollandish kitchens, and this is done only with respect to the props and predominantly brown coloring. The primary object of the painting is a young kitchen maid on a low chair, looking to the right of the viewer during what appears to be a pause from her task. The expression on the maid's face is one that is neither of sadness nor one of joy; picturing a woman that is focused on her work. The pictoral space is bounded, with a quality of contentment and timelessness. One the floor are assorted vegetables, some cooking pots, and a butcher's block. The block features a meat-cleaver with a spat of blood, bringing in the suggestion of violence to the purposed domestic reflection. It is unknown whether or not Chardin had intended for there to be a message in the painting, or if at all in any of his paintings. Despite portraying a servant helping in domestic tasks‚Äî‚Äîdescribed to be of a low social scale‚Äî‚Äîthe woman was still dressed well. In addition, the kitchen is kept in neat order; a sharp contrast to the portrayals of domestic servants in other paintings of the time. Nevertheless, the maid is still not a model of industry either, as the viewer in intended to speculate on what the maid is speculating in her moment of pause. It has been mentioned by critics that there is a sensuous quality in Chardin's execution, in design, and in the choice of his colors. The techniques of ambiguity and sense has been noted to be a common trait for many of Chardin's works. Exhibition Chardin first exhibited the painting along with five other works at the Salon of 1739 as La Ratisseuse de Navets (Woman scraping Turnips). When the painting was first submitted, it drew little attention from critics due to the success of his other painting: The Governess. Chardin painted at least three versions of the painting. The existing works are the Washington copy, signed and dated to 1738; another in Munich, signed and dated to 1746; a copy given by Count Rudolf von Rothenburg for Frederick II of Prussia, lost since 1918; and the fourth copy in the Netherlands, believed to be a studio copy. The existence of four copies of the painting attests to the success of the painting with some copies, such as the Washington copy, being at some point acquired by royals such as the Prince of Liechtenstein.

Name and language Gaagudju was a language spoken by a primary group known by that name, and a secondary group of contiguous peoples who used it as a second language, such as the Amurdak, Gundjeihmi, Giimiyu, Bininj and Umbugarla peoples. Many of the latter ceased to speak their mother tongue in preference for Gaagudju after the 1930s, and it became in turn their first language. Country The Gaagudju were a people of the northern Kakadu area. Baldwin Spencer identified the area around Oenpelli as Gaagudju territory, for they happened to be the dominant group there at the time. In Norman Tindale's estimate, the Gaagudju possessed estates covering inland of the Van Diemen Gulf some between the eastern and southern Alligator Rivers, and running southwards as far as the mountain country. They were resident at both Cannon Hill and Mount Basedow. Social organisation The Gaagudju were divided into 4 estate-owning clans, the Bunidj, the Djindibi (around Munmalarri), and two Mirarr clans. History of contact The Cobourg cattle company took up a lease for hunting buffalo in the Alligator River area in 1876, and Aboriginal people were a major part of the workforce. The Gaagudju, with the arrival of the feral buffalo hunter Paddy Cahill in their area in the 1880s, were employed by him in tracking and harvesting kills of this introduced animal. For many decades they dominated the industry. There was a dramatic population collapse in that area for the next three decades (1880-1920) due to introduced diseases and new colonial land use. Most of the material collected by Baldwin Spencer over two months on the people of Oenpelli reflects a Gaagudja perspective, since Spencer's main informant, Cahill, happened to be fluent in that language and was an intermediary between Spencer and the three Indigenous informants, Mitcheralaka (Madjirrilaaga) of the Mirarr clan, Kopereiki (Gabhirrigi) of the Bunidj clan, and Wardiirdi, also of the Bunidj, and Wudeirti. But at the same time Spencer realised that several other Aboriginal peoples were present at Oenpelli and that Cahill's Gaagudeju testimony covered their distinct traditions as well. After Cahill's death the Gaahudju shifted to the Alice and Mary River areas, to continue buffalo hunting, and gradually Oenpelli was occupied by the Kunwi≈ãku who moved in from the west.

Another problem for Soviet submarines was operating in shallow waters, making little room for depth maneuvers in addition to the risk of mines and air attack. The German ground advance forced all the Soviet vessels operating from Tallinn to retreat as part of the bloody Soviet evacuation of Tallinn, among the vessels lost there were the submarines S-5 and ShCh-301.

She appeared both on stage and in silent films; however, all films featuring Langer as an actress are now considered lost. Early life Gilda Langer was born Hermengild Langer into a Sudeten German family in Oderfurt, Austria-Hungary (now, P≈ô√≠voz, Czech Republic). Around 1915, she met Austrian dramaturge and screenwriter Carl Mayer in Vienna who then took her to Berlin and helped her to gain an engagement as a stage actress at the Residenz Theatre. Her first role at the theatre was in a production of the Robert Gr√∂tzach-penned 1917 play Dyckerpotts Erben. Film career In 1917, Carl Mayer announced to the film trade press that Langer would begin appearing in leading lady roles in several films for the newly created Berlin-based Star- Film company. Her first film role was in the 1917 Alexander Antalffy and Paul Leni-directed drama The Mystery of Bangalore, opposite actors Conrad Veidt and Harry Liedtke. This was followed in 1918 by a starring role in the Jen≈ë Ill√©s- directed drama Struggling Souls. After being introduced to filmmaker Fritz Lang, Langer would appear prominently in Lang's films Halbblut and Der Herr der Liebe, both released in 1919. In 1919, Gilda Langer was cast to play the role of Jane in the Robert Wiene-directed and Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz- penned German Expressionist horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. However, Langer became ill before shooting and had to be replaced by actress Lil Dagover. Langer's last film role was in the Fritz Lang-penned and Otto Rippert directed 1919 drama The Woman with Orchids. Personal life and death In January 1920, Langer became engaged to Hungarian film director Paul Czinner. Langer fell ill with a lung infection after contracting the Spanish flu shortly after this engagement and died on 31 January 1920, aged 23. Her funeral was held on 4 February 1920 and she was interred at the S√ºdwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf cemetery in Stahnsdorf, Brandenburg.

Led by Dr. Orval J. Cunningham from the University of Kansas the facility was constructed to offer oxygen therapy on a large scale. The main structure for delivery of the treatment was a 900-ton steel sphere built in 1928. Consisting of five stories, the sphere stood at 64 feet and contained 38 rooms. 350 portholes helped to illuminate the rooms. The building was funded and built by the Timken Roller Bearing Company and linked to the three-story sanitarium hotel. It opened on December 1, 1928. Dr. Cunningham chose to build the sanitarium at 18485 Lake Shore Boulevard near East 185th Street. The site, along the shore of Lake Erie, was chosen for its aesthetics. Dr. Cunningham believed that he could treat cancer and diabetes with hyperbaric medicine. Dr. Cunningham sold the site to James Rand Jr., son of one of the cofounders of Remington Rand and prot√©g√© of Cunningham, in 1934. Rand reopened the buildings the following year as the Ohio Institute of Oxygen Therapy, making use of the unique facility. It did not last long and was soon turned into a general hospital under the name Boulevard Hospital. Financial problems led to its closure in 1937 and the site lay dormant until it was bought by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. The Cunningham Sanitarium building was razed on March 31, 1942 and the steel was used in the war effort. In 1950 the ground on which the sphere stood was turned into a school, St. Joseph High School, now the Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School. The main building was used as a hospital, Catholic Youth Organization headquarters and orphanage before becoming the St. Joseph Christian Life Center. This building was razed in 2010 and the property is used for green space by the Hospice of the Western Reserve, which owns the land.

He is the founder and CEO of ERG Enterprises, Omega Hospital and The Hand Center of Louisiana in New Orleans. He is also a venture capitalist, real estate investor, author, and philanthropist.  Medical career  Eric George grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, and graduated from Marshall University with a double major in chemistry and political science. After being accepted to both medical school and law school, George decided to become a medical doctor and was trained in orthopaedic hand surgery. George is a graduate of Marshall University's School of Medicine in 1989, completed a General Trauma Surgery Residency at Michigan State University and a Fellowship in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Grand Rapids Area Medical Education Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Subsequently, he completed an Orthopedic Hand and Upper Extremity Reconstructive Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. He is board-certified and holds a certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand. George is currently a Professor of Hand Surgery at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and Tulane University in New Orleans. George has published articles in academic journals including Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and The American Surgeon. George founded the Hand Center of Louisiana, a surgical practice based in Metairie, Louisiana. In 2003, George co-founded Omega Hospital, a specialty surgical hospital, and became its CEO. Omega became the first physician-owned hospital in the greater New Orleans area. The luxury hospital focused on improving the patient experience by offering rooms with mini-bars, microwaves, and additional beds for family members to stay overnight. Today, George continues to serve as CEO of the Hand Center of Louisiana, where he works with the Saints and regularly treats NFL and NBA athletes, including Jimmy Graham and Anthony Davis, high- profile celebrities, and professionals in the oil and gas industry, as well as other businesses. George also maintains his role as CEO at Omega Hospital, where he actively practices full-time. Since 2007, George has appeared in the annual list of Best Doctors¬Æ, a national peer-nominated survey of the best physicians across 450 specialties and subspecialties.  Business activities  George's career as an entrepreneur and investor began in 2006, when he founded and became the CEO of ERG Enterprises, a venture investment firm based in New Orleans. In its early years, ERG made investments in healthcare facilities. That changed in 2009, when it partnered with The Berger Company to purchase the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans. While the hotel was owned by London-based Orient Express Hotels at the time, the transaction would return the luxury hotel to local ownership. In 2011 George attempted to purchase the Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre when the theatre fell into financial disorder, however his bid wasn't successful. Under George's direction, ERG Enterprises bought the famed Orpheum Theater in 2013, which suffered significant damage from Hurricane Katrina, shut down, and fell into a state of disrepair. George and fellow investors began plans to restore and enhance the original theater. The upgrade, which took over a year, included an expanded marble lobby, enlarged seating, additional bathrooms, multiple bars, and an auditorium floor that used hydraulics to accommodate the different surface requirements of concerts and events. The grand reopening of the theater occurred August 2015, just in time to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In 2020, the theater underwent a second major renovation under George's ownership. The basement of the theater was converted into an underground speakeasy called the Double Dealer, which opened January 24, 2020. George's ERG Enterprises also invested in an $18 million renovation project of the Pythian building in New Orleans. In 2015, George and ERG Enterprises acquired the Pythian with Dr. William Bradshaw of Green Coast Enterprises and Crescent City Community Land Trust. They reopened the property in 2017 as an apartment building offering workforce-rate housing, a 20,000 square-foot food hall, office space, and healthcare facilities. Today, ERG Enterprises owns Windsor Court Hotel, Pontchartrain Hotel, Royal Orleans Hotel, Westin Canal Place, The Frenchmen Hotel, and Thompson Nashville. In 2019, ERG recently joined Gayle Benson and her investment company GMB Properties, The Berger Company, and Fulcrum Hospitality in acquiring the Hyatt Regency New Orleans, which is largest hotel acquisition in the history of Louisiana. In 2020, the company also purchased the old United Fruit Company building on Saint Charles Avenue. He is additionally the owner of a pineapple farm in Panama and several assisted-living facilities in the state of Louisiana. George has additionally founded and supplied a grade school in the city of Mombassa, Kenya. In 2019, George published his first book, We: Ditch the Me Mindset and Change the World. The book focuses on his life experiences as a doctor and entrepreneur, and emphasizes the importance of orienting one's life around other people and making them the primary focus.  Philanthropy  George is an active philanthropist. In 2004, he became the benefactor and namesake of George Cottage at St. Martin's Episcopal School in New Orleans. George and his family also funded and participated in the construction of a new nursery school for an orphanage in Mombasa, Kenya. George has also established the Colonel Aaron C-Dot George Scholarship at Marshall University, as well as the George Family Scholarship Fund at New York University Law School.

Life He was born on the island of Yell in the Shetland Islands north of mainland Scotland, the youngest of ten children to John Robertson, a relatively wealthy merchant. His family moved to Aberdeen in his youth and he was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School then studied at Marischal College in Aberdeen, graduating MA in 1778. He moved to Jamaica in 1778/9 and leased out cattle to plantation owners. He made maps from at least 1791. In 1796 he successfully lobbied the House of Assembly to commission him for three years to map the entire island. He completed his one inch to a mile series of maps in November 1799 and was further commissioned to create more detailed maps which he completed in 1801. For the task he was paid ¬£10,450, an absolute fortune at that time. He then went to London to organise for the printing (and sale) of his maps, which were published in 1804. In London he lived in the Pall Mall area. In December 1810 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He unsuccessfully lobbied the Admiralty to commission the mapping of Orkney and Shetland, and unsuccessfully lobbied landowners to map Northumberland. However, he obtained a successful commission from local landowners to map Aberdeenshire. This was begun in 1810 but was not \\"completed\\" until 1822. But the commissioning group were less than happy with the result, which was proven to have multiple omissions. Robertson went to court in Edinburgh's High Court to receive the agreed payment but the issue remained unresolved at the point of his death in Edinburgh, on 15 January 1829. By contrast, in the 1980s the Jamaican maps were compared against modern maps and found to be 98% accurate.

The game takes place on a fictional island named Granichny, where secret experiments resulted in a massive \\"mutation\\" of the world. The player assumes the role of a Volunteer, who must research the paranormal activities of the island, gathering information and undertaking dangerous tasks. Gameplay Desolate is a survival game set in an open world environment. It contains a dynamic day and night cycle, and is played from a first-person perspective. Most of the gameplay is built around combat, exploration and campaign storyline progression. The game can be played either in single- player, or with up to four-player co-operative multiplayer. The game‚Äôs combat is mostly melee-based, with ammo for firearms being very rare. Players can use different weapons, which can be found throughout Granichny, as well as gathered from enemies. The weapons can also be upgraded with different modifications. Players can repair their weapon a limited number of times. The game tracks 5 main elements of survival: Health, Hunger, Thirst, Cold and Stress. While travelling around the game, players find various medical supplies, food and water, which can be used to restore the according element. Players can also find different crafting ingredients and blueprints, which allow them to create new items and equipment. Throughout the game, players earn Experience Points (XP) by completing tasks and defeating enemies. After gathering enough XP, players earn a Skill Point - which can be used to unlock various abilities and enhancements in one of the 3 Skill Trees: Crafting, Fighting and Survival. Plot Desolate takes place in Russia during the Soviet era. The game's prologue follows Victor Ognin, the founder of the New Light Conglomerate, as he commits an act of sabotage against his own company that will \\"change the world forever\\". Victor's actions release mutants and dangerous unnatural phenomena across the world. The epicenter of these events is the island of Granichny, off the coast of the Russian mainland. The day the world changed forever becomes known as \\"Day X\\", and Victor goes into hiding. The main game takes place two years afterwards, with the player taking the role of a Volunteer, an agent of New Light assigned to explore Granichny on behalf of the Conglomerate in hopes of discovering a means to reverse the global damage caused by Victor. After performing various errands to gain the cooperation of the island's local population, the Volunteer is tasks by his handler, 400, to retrieve classified New Light documents. The documents reveal that New Light captured island locals and used them in human experimentation, including 400's wife and daughter, resulting in their deaths. 400's daughter, Lily, now haunts the island as a ghost that menaces the Volunteer on multiple occasions. Distraught, 400 abandons New Light and vanishes. Meanwhile, the Volunteer begins to receive mocking messages from a voice in his head that claims to be one and the same as him, and who possesses the ability to change either the Volunteer's perception of the world or the world itself, such as turning the world green or causing giant whales to swim through the sky. The Volunteer is soon contacted by Eleanora, the leader of Pravda, an independent organization opposed to New Light that is attempting to uncover the truth behind Day X. While performing missions for Pravda, the Volunteer discovers that New Light has been deliberately converting captured locals into \\"Subject 47s\\", insane madmen who are then killed to harvest the unique moss growing in their bodies, which New Light uses as a fuel source. The Volunteer is convinced by this to turn against New Light and help Pravda broadcast a message revealing the truth to the world. The Volunteer later learns that the spatial anomalies on the island are actually former humans who have been converted into anomalies by New Light's research. He meets Alice Ognin, Victor Ognin's daughter and a former New Light scientist, who turned herself into an anomaly in hopes this would convince her father to stop New Light's human experimentation. Alice begs the Volunteer to end her suffering, which the Volunteer does with a special device specifically designed to destroy anomalies. Meanwhile, Pravda's headquarters are stormed by the Soviet secret police, and Eleanora and all other members of Pravda are summarily executed. 400 contacts the Volunteer and reveals that Victor Ognin is leading a breakaway splinter group of New Light headquartered in a heavily defended fortress stronghold on the island. The Volunteer decides to assassinate Ognin in the hopes of putting an end to New Light. After infiltrating Ognin's bunker, the Volunteer confronts Ognin, who turns out to be a massive anomaly. The Ognin-Anomaly reveals it is the Voice inside the Volunteer's head. Speaking with the voices of the Voice, Victor Ognin, 400, and Eleanora, the Ognin-Anomaly explains that he accidentally destroyed the world on Day X, and altered reality to create a new world in his mind. All the people the Volunteer encountered were simply reflections of Ognin's consciousness, including the Volunteer himself, who is the embodiment of Victor's conscience and desire to correct his mistakes. Ognin informs the Volunteer that he is no longer needed, and compels him to shoot himself in the head. The Volunteer awakens back at his safe house, wondering how many times he's relived these events and how many more times they will occur. The game ends with a philosophical message from the development team thanking the player for supporting the game. Development The core gameplay of Desolate is based on Beyond Despair - a game developed by Pixelmate, and released on January 16, 2017. Beyond Despair was not a commercial success, and Pixelmate was closed due to its financial situation. A part of the old team created a new studio, with financial support by HypeTrain Digital, refining the gameplay from Beyond Despair, while adding new content. Most of the gameplay changes were directed by fan input. All Beyond Despair owners received a free copy of Desolate. The game was on Steam Early Access, and now the full version is available.

Life  Son of Revd William Taylor and Judith Charlett of South Littleton. Educated Trinity College Oxford, matriculated 22 March 1666 ‚Äì 1667; BA 1670; MA 1673; BD 1682; DD 1686. Installed as rector of Grafton Flyford 1678, then in 1684 as rector of Severn Stoke. Some of the entries in the parish book of Severn Stoke written in Taylor's hand suggest that he had no great respect or honour for James II: Having previously sworn an oath of allegiance to James II of England, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to William and was deprived of the living. Taylor remained in Worcestershire with some contact with George Hicks, nonjuring Dean of Worcester. By 1699, Taylor was chaplain to the court of James II at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Little is known of his time there beyond that he attended the funeral of Denis Granville, that he owned one or more telescopes, and that he was given two gold sleeve buttons by James II. During this time, he felt the need to deny that he had converted to Roman Catholicism. In December 1712, he petitioned Queen Anne to be allowed to return from France. On return to England, Taylor took the side of the non- usager faction in the split of about 1717. Taylor was consecrated bishop at Grey‚Äôs Inn, 25 January 1721 by the nonjuroring non-usager bishops, Samuel Hawes, Nathaniel Spinckes and Henry Gandy, in the presence of the Earl of Winchilsea, Robert Cotton, Revd Thomas Bell and John Blackbourne. He consecrated Richard Welton as bishop. Then Taylor and Welton consecrated John Talbot but the consecration was not recognised by other nonjurors as Welton had been consecrated by Taylor alone. Taylor died 26 December 1722Evening Post (2097): p. 2. 3‚Äì5 January 1723 at his brother's house in South Littleton and interred at the church in South Littleton. A 1722 portrait by John Verelst engraved by George Vertue was published in 1723.

Plot It is the last day before Great Lent, and the family is busy eating, knowing they'll have to spend the next seven weeks on lean diet. Pavel Vasilyevich is summoned by his wife Pelageya Ivanovna to help out his son Styopa, a high-school boy in the second class, who sits in the nursery, crying over the textbook, having trouble understanding division of fractions, apparently as a result of having eaten too much pancakes. Rather dazed himself after heavy lunch, the father makes a poor job of it and, having totally lost the plot, starts relating his own stories about his school. Pelageya Ivanovna calls them to the table for tea, where they join her in the company of two aunts (one of whom is mostly silent, another is deaf and dumb) and a midwife. The conversation centers around the superb quality of the jam. Pavel Vasilyevich makes an attempt to return to his school memoirs with the story about a big schoolboy called Mamakhin who terrorized his teachers. The samovar, the cups, and the tablecloth are cleared away, but the family do not leave the table, waiting now for the supper. The midwife starts hiccupping, while Pavel Vasilyevich and Styopa sit side by side examining a volume of the Niva magazine. The cook, Anna, comes into the dining-room, and asks for forgiveness everybody except the midwife to whom she considers it superfluous to bow down, since she is not one of the gentry. And then Styopa terrifies his mother with the declaration that he wants to sleep and is going to bed. The boy missing the final supper before Lent is unthinkable, so she rushes to the kitchen to hurry the cook up, and the table is getting laid again, for supper.

It was first published in Croatia under the name Poslanik by LMI, followed by an international release by On-Deck Interactive in January 2001. Development and sales The game uses 3D pre-rendered character models over a static, often animated backgrounds. The developer released a demo, which could be found on the CD of the computer magazine Hacker. The development took around 2 years without a budget and the game sold in nearly 300,000 units. Synopsis The story follows the fictionalized version of events of the Apollo 19 mission from 1979. Two of the crew member are found dead, with the protagonist, David Walker, finding himself in an extraterrestrial laboratory. Throughout the story, the protagonist realizes he is meant to be the mythical Ward, in order to resolve the conflict between two alien races; the Greys and the Reptillians. He sets out to help humanity from total annihilation, but also aids Greys in their war against their former masters, the reptillians. During the course of the adventure, he uncovers many secrets and histories of the universe. Reception Croatian website Gamer.hr praised its low system requirements, the story, music and the animations but stated the game was littered with bugs and the movement was badly implemented. It also criticized its ending as rushed, as if it skipped over a certain portion of its story. The game received mixed reviews upon its international release. Ron Dulin, in his review for Gamespot gave it 6.2 out of 10, praising certain points in its story and gameplay, but criticized the lack of voiceovers, the dated graphics and the lackluster progression of its story. IGN gave a similar opinion, stating that, apart from a neat few locales, it falls short of games like The Longest Journey due to the relatively low production values. It, however, praised its soundtrack and gameplay as entertaining, giving the entire package 6.4 out of 10. PC Zone gave it 5.1 out of 10, mostly criticizing its outdatedness. The game currently holds a score of 57/100 based on 14 reviews on Metacritic and 60/100 on Gamerankings based on 19 reviews.

She is known for being one of the most active feminist artists in the country. She uses a multidisciplinary approach by employing various media such as drawing, painting, mural art, book-objects, video, performance, photography, and installation, and her work has been shown in museums, galleries, conferences, symposium, and broadcast venues around the world. Her career spanned across two eras in Romania: the social, cultural, and political restrictions of the Communist era and freedom of the post-revolution era that allowed her to expand her expression. Preda S√¢nc explored a variety of themes including feminism, gender identity, gender fusion, globalization, self-exploration, and the interaction between public and private spaces.  Education and Work  Preda S√¢nc received her B.A. from the National University of Arts in Bucharest in 1980. She later received a Ph. D. in visual arts in 2002. Her early work in the 80s was confined by the censorship regulations of the Communist government, but emphasized the exploration of the relationships between body and space (e.g. My Body is Space in Space, Time For Memory of All), and the expression of self-analysis. She states 'I am concerned about the idea of the inner and outer landscape of the human body; about places for meditation thoughts and emotions, opening a path toward a deeper penetration of multiple layers of reality.' Even though she faced restrictions, her art was still considered very experimental for the time, as seen in projects such as her intervention photographs and photo collages. After the 1989 revolution, Preda S√¢nc expanded her work to include a critical analysis of social and political norms in the country. This was because of the increased freedom for expression in the Eastern European art world as well as increased access to information from the Western world. During this time she also diversified her technique to include globe objects, video performances, and multimedia installations. Influenced by the war in Yugoslavia in 1999, she explored issues of globalization and political and cultural conflict (e.g. Remapping the World). She also no longer was separated from the feminist movement and was one of the only Romanian artists that actually embraced this label.  Role in Feminism in Romania  Feminism in Romania did not take hold as it did in Western countries. During the Communist era, men and women in theory held equal positions, but in reality domestic work was still done primarily by women. Policies regarding reproduction also placed constraints on women's control over their sexual and reproductive life. After the revolution, women still experiences hardships, facing more difficulties finding work than men and receiving less pay. Although information access has increased in the country and there is more freedom to protest gender inequality, there is often a lack of interest in doing so. \\"The weak representation of feminist art in Romania is based on inconsistencies in information, prejudices, and negative value judgments: the majority of art training‚Äôs interest is focused on making art as a means of expression without applying any serious gendered analysis\\" (Olivia Nitis). Wanda Mihuleac is considered to be the only artist pre-1990 to have any feminist approach in her work. After the revolution there were still very few to engage in this type of dialogue, even to the point of refusing to discuss what it was like being a woman in Romania during the Communist time. This is partly due to the negative connotation feminism has in the country and the idea that it lacks relevance in contemporary society. Marilena Preda S√¢nc is one of the only artists who embraces this term and addresses issues of gender inequality in her work. She uses her art related to feminism as a \\"self-referential statement,\\" often incorporating themes related to body (e.g. Bodyscape, Handscape, Mindscape 1993). Preda S√¢nc sees social and political criticism as very personal, incorporating internal identity with external issues. One exhibition that she participated in that was related specifically to feminism was Perspectives in 2008. The project, organized by Olivia Nitis (curator, art critic, and feminist writer), was intended to \\"explore the cultural and historical differences between countries with no connection or with a direct and more appropriate connection to the waves and changes feminism has produced.\\" One of Preda S√¢nc's works exhibited in this show was the photography/video installation Diva. In 2013, Good Girls.Memory, Desire, Power international exhibition happened at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest. The project had three sections: \\"Memory\\", \\"Desire\\" and \\"Power\\", and was accompanied by an international symposium. Marilena Preda S√¢nc was its initiator and one of the sixty women artists exhibiting there. The show was initiated by Preda S√¢nc out of her \\"desire to set up in Bucharest a larger exhibition of women artists, preferably of those who decided, like herself, to take a feminist position.\\" (Bojana PEJIƒÜ)  Museum Holdings  * MNAC (The National Museum of Contemporary Art) Bucharest (feminist work) * Art Museums Oradea; Engraving Museu;, Bistri≈£a, Graphic Museum Tulcea * Arhitekturni Muzej Ljubljana, Group Junij Collection, Lujljana (My Body is Space in Space, Time in Time and Memory of All) * Albertina Art Collections, Vienna, Austria * Kunsthalle, Nurenberg * Centro d‚ÄôArte Spaziotempo Firenze * St. Stephen King Museum (artist book Body+Sound) * Art Center Hugo Voeten, Belgium * Art works in private collection: Austria, Belgium Bulgary, Canada, England, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Slovenia, U.S.A., South Korea, India, Denmark.

He was the great- grandfather of the Gurjara-Pratihara court poet Rajashekhara.  Biography  Akalajalada was the great-grandfather of the 10th century poet Rajashekhara, so he must have lived in the 8th century or 9th century. He came from the Yayavara Brahmana family of Maharashtra: Rajashekhara's Bala-Ramayana calls him Maharashtra-chudamani (\\"crest jewel of Maharashtra\\"). The prologue of the text names the poets Surananda and Tarala as other members of this family. These ancestors of Rajashekhara flourished at the court of the Kalachuris of Tripuri. \\"Akalajalada\\" (literally \\"out-of-season cloud\\") was probably a sobriquet, not the poet's real name. The poet was also known by other names, including Dakshinatya and Dvanduka. A verse attributed to Akalajalada in Sharngadhara-paddhati is attributed to Dakshinatya (\\"Southern\\") in Vallabha- deva's Subhashitavali. Vidyakara's Subhashita-ratna-kosha attributes the same verse to \\"Dvanduka\\". According to a verse by Rajashekhara, quoted by the 12th century writer Jalhana, a dramatist named Kadambari-rama plagiarized from Akalajalada for a nataka (play), and gained reputation as an excellent poet.  Works  Only one verse attributed to Akalajalada is now extant. Its English translation by A. K. Warder is as follows: Alternative translation by M. C. Choubey, according to whom this is the description of a drought in the Tripuri Kalachuri kingdom: A verse attributed to Rajashekhara in Jalhana's Sukti-muktavali suggests that Akalajalada had written many muktakas (detached stanzas). These were later compiled into a collection titled Vachana- Chandrika, which was highly appreciated by 77 contemporary poets.

Emmanuelle hopes to create emotion through color and allow people to experience color through touch and feel as well. This will show that colors can not only make space, but also create a space with additional layers of human emotion.

She has shown work in a number of shows including the 2012 Soft Power show at Alan Art Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the 2013 Journey of Belonging, a solo show at Athr Gallery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the 2017 100 Masterpieces of Modern and Contemporary Arab Art in Paris, France, as well as having her work exhibited in the 2014 USA Biennial in Houston, the 2015 P.3: Prospect New Orleans USA Biennial Notes For Now, and the Venice Biennale in the Future of a Promise Exhibition. Her work spans many mediums from photography to installation and focuses on a progressive examination and critique women's roles in Saudi society.  Early life  Al Dowayan was born in 1973 in Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province. She attended university, graduating with a Masters in Systems Analysis and Design. She began her career working for an oil company before transitioning full-time to an artistic practice in 2010 which primarily examines personal and political issues related to women's rights in the context of ultra-conservative Saudi Arabian laws that include banning women from travelling, driving, or speaking a woman's name in public. Manal Al Dowayan currently resides in London, England where she is working on her Masters in Contemporary Art Practice in the Public Sphere at the Royal College of Art in London. Photography Manal Al Dowayan's early work primarily utilized black and white photography, including images from her I AM collection, Drive-By Shootings, and Nostalgia Carries Us. The I Am collection from 2005 was inspired by a speech given by King Abdullah Al Saud when he took the Saudi throne in 2005 in which he emphasized the importance of women's participation in building and enriching Saudi society. The controversial statement was interpreted in many ways by critics both for and against women's rights. Al Dowayan, from the statement, was inspired to photograph the women she believed the king was referring to from engineers to mothers to scientists, her series promoted the visibility and importance of Saudi Arabian women. Photographs from the Drive-By Shootings collection (2011) demonstrate the difficulty female artists working in Saudi Arabia face as their public movements are heavily restricted by the government. As a female, Al-Dowayan could not legally drive, but had a male drive her as she took photographs from the passenger seat of the moving vehicle. The resulting blurred images emphasize that she cannot simply step out of the car in order to create her art, but is subject to maintaining gender-appropriate behavior as an aspect of her creative process. Installation art Manal Al Dowayan with the Soft Power show behind In 2012 Al Dowayan's installation work was featured in the Edge of Arabia show We Need to Talk in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The show highlighted the need for progressive reform in Saudi Arabia as perceived by the artists. At the time it was the largest and most radical exhibit of contemporary Saudi artists, all of whom ran the risk of political backlash for their dissident artistic expressions. Al Dowayan's work Esmi My Name featured larger than life wooden worry beads with the names of women painted on them, hung from wool rope woven by Bedouin women. Saudi Arabians believe to utter a woman's name in public is a shameful or embarrassing taboo, casting Saudi women into obscurity and removing their unique identity, which according to Al Dowayan \\"is deeply linked to several elements of an individual's personality and one's name is integral among these elements thus by making women's names public. Al Dowayan's work seeks to question and change women's roles and treatment in Saudi society. Among Al- Dowayan's most well-known work is Suspended Together (2011), a series consisting of 200 white fiberglass doves suspended from the ceiling. Each dove, a traditional symbol of freedom, has reproduced on it a permission-to- travel document that all Saudi women must have in order to travel. The certificate must be issued and signed by their appointed male guardian, be it their father, brother, or husband. The certificates Al Dowayan chose to reproduce were sent to her from a variety of Saudi women. The certificates range from six months to sixty years old, documenting a history of women's restricted rights. Al Dowayan describes the piece: \\"In this installation of doves, I explore the concept of suspended movement. Many leading women from Saudi, wonderful scientists, educators, engineers, artists and leaders, have donated their papers to be included in this artwork. These women are breaking new ground and achieving for their society, but when it comes to travel they are still treated 'like a flock of suspended doves.'\\" Al-Dowayan's work has been exhibited at the British Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art in Qatar among others.

Legacy Peter Stuyvesant, the son of a Calvinist minister, and his family were large landowners in the northeastern portion of New Amsterdam arising from his period as the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland. Stuyvesant was known as: > \\"a man of strong individuality, great firmness and remarkable foresight, he > so impressed himself upon the affairs that the story of his life from 1647 > to 1664 is practically a history of the colony during that period.\\" Currently, the Stuyvesant name is associated with several places in Manhattan's East Side, near present-day Gramercy Park: the Stuyvesant Town housing complex; Stuyvesant Square, a park in the area; and the Stuyvesant Apartments on East 18th Street, and Stuyvesant Street. His farm, called the \\"Bouwerij\\" - the seventeenth-century Dutch word for \\"farm\\" - was the source for the name of the Manhattan street and surrounding neighborhood named \\"The Bowery\\".

However, this name had already been used for a different species in 1881, so was illegitimate. The species was first legitimately named in 1898 by Friedrich Kraenzlin as Peristylus secundiflorus. It was later transferred to Gymnadenia and then to Neottianthe. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of Neottianthe, Amitostigma and Ponerorchis were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Neottianthe and Amitostigma were subsumed into Ponerorchis, with this species becoming Ponerorchis secundiflora.

She also coined the term \\"greenwoodworking\\" as a single word in her book, Make a Chair from a Tree: An Introduction to Working Green Wood. Background Jennie Alexander was a transgender woman from 2007 onward, born as John David Alexander Jr.\\"Meet the author: Jennie Alexander\\", blog.lostartpress.com, May 25, 2017. Alexander spent her early childhood in Baltimore, Maryland learning to play the piano and later became a Jazz musician. She was introduced to woodworking at the Baltimore polytechnic institute High School and would later go on to open up her own home shop in 1960. Her mother grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts, and was part of the educational sloyd system. Because of this Jennie was always encouraged to explore woodworking and learning through doing. Her father was a lawyer, and Jennie also attended law school at the university of Maryland, becoming a well respected divorce lawyer. She embraced greenwoodworking as an avocation. She both practiced greenwoodworking, and studied the history of greenwoodworking by examining furniture at museums, private collections, auction houses, etc. Jennie Alexander's wife, Joyce, died in 1996. The couple had three daughters. In 2007, at the age of 77 and after 32 years of Alcoholics Anonymous Jennie transitioned from male to female. Jennie Alexander has five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren; one of whom is John D. Alexander III.  Career  In 1978, Alexander wrote, Make a Chair from a Tree: An Introduction to Working Green Wood, which was the first woodworking book published by Taunton Press. This book describes the process and tools required to construct a shaved two-slat post-and-rung chair without the use of a wood lathe. She became a member of the Early American Industries Association (EAIA) which was a crucial step in her exploration of woodworking and chair making as it gave her access to collections of joined furniture. She also demonstrated how to make the shaved two-slat post-and-rung chair at an event hosted by EAIA. She later taught classes at Drew Langsner's Country Workshops in North Carolina and mentored many students. At Country Workshops she met Peter Follansbee, and after years of corresponding, would go on to co write a book with him called, Make a Joint Stool from a Tree: An Introduction to 17th- Century Joinery. She spent her later years mentoring many in greenwoodworking techniques and joinery. Jennie died July 12, 2018.  Two-slat post-and-rung shaving chair  Jennie Alexander had attributed the success of the post-and- rung shaving chair to her wife, who after Jennie was told she could not wood turn in front of a live audience, encouraged Jennie to make the same chair by shaving all the parts close to round without a lathe. Jennie said, ‚ÄúSo the shaving, really, made the existence of the post-and-rung chair a reality in this country.‚Äù From her book, Make a Chair from a Tree: An Introduction to Working Green Wood: This chair differs in part from the Windsor chair because it does not have a solid carved seat. In a Ladderback Chair, the seat is not structural. Where in a Windsor chair, the seat is structural - all the legs, back and arms terminate in the seat.

She first appeared on-screen during the episode broadcast on 20 April 2018. Emma's storylines include short-term relationships with David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni), surviving a roof collapse at the local factory and discovering that Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) is her biological father. Storylines Emma applies for an apprentice position at Audrey's when Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon) struggles to handle her work-load with owner Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) being in hospital and David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) taking some time off work due to personal reasons. Her application is successful and she begins work that month, much to the displeasure of David - who is set to be training her after he returns to work the same month - as he finds her annoying. When Emma arrives late, having missed her tram as she was too busy preparing for her first day, she begins irritating David by accidentally dropping products on the floor, her lack of initiative to put the kettle on and her constant apologies for her mistakes, among other things. David cited that she was a \\"walking disaster zone\\" and told Maria that there was no way she would be staying. However, Maria was insistent that she needed extra help with the amount of time David and his gran were taking off and said that Emma was friendly and keen to work. Despite his initial dislike for Emma, David realised that she was the perfect opportunity to help him feel masculine again - after he was viciously raped by his supposed friend Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton) in March that year. David seduced Emma and, hoping to impress the boss in order to keep the job, she agreed to have sex with him and the pair began a relationship - with Emma leaving her shared flat and moving into 8 Coronation Street, much to Gail Rodwell's (Helen Worth) shock. Shona tells David to stop using Emma, as she is young and naive and shouldn't be brought into his dramas - but he refuses until the tragic suicide of Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward) in May. Realising the extent of his own mental health issues brought on by the rape and that he needs help before he goes the same way Aidan did - David broke off his relationship with Emma, confessing his love for Shona and admits that he'd been raped by Josh. Emma gets over being dumped quickly, moving into 19a Rosamund Street with Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) and Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman) - as per Shona's advice and begins showing an interest in local builder Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) who, unlike David, was a similar age to her. Emma and Seb began to flirt, despite the fact that he was still in a relationship with Faye Windass (Ellie Leach) - who became jealous of his and Emma's attraction. In August 2018, Faye's step- mother, Sally Metcalfe (Sally Dynevor) clocked Seb's dissatisfaction when Faye revealed that she was returning to the area full time, having been living with her mother Anna (Debbie Rush) for the past few month and implored Seb to end things with her if she wasn't who he wanted to be with. Although Seb found himself unable to confide in Emma that he had HIV and the pair's relationship didn't progress. Eventually, Emma moved in to 2a Coronation Street with Maria, her son Liam Connor (Charlie Wrenshall) and Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) after deciding to leave Billy's flat after it got too cramped with the addition of Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). Later Emma strikes up a friendship with Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and agrees to go on a date with him in order for her to work out his flaws when it comes to relationships. Emma quickly falls for Chesney and they begin dating, but she is disheartened to realise that he is actually interested in Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) instead. Unwilling to stand between 'true love', Emma breaks things off with Chesney and implores him to make a go of things with Gemma. Emma becomes firm friends with Gemma, who is able to convince Johnny (Richard Hawley) and Jenny Connor (Sally Ann Matthews) to hire Emma at The Rovers Return - and the pair are caught up in the Underworld factory roof collapse together when Gary Windass (Mikey North) sabotages the roof, although both escaped unscathed - the collapse proved fatal for Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia).  Development  = Character creation and role = Emma first appeared in Episode 9435 in April 2018. Mardell's casting was announced on 21 March 2018, where it was revealed that she would be introduced as the new apprentice at Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) salon. Duncan Lindsay of the Metro reported that Emma would be incompetent at her job, which makes her clash with David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), who had recently been raped by Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton). David Brown of the Radio Times described the character as \\"bubbly\\". In June 2018, Mardell was offered a six-month extension to her contract after proving popular with the producers as well as the viewers. Following her contract renewal, Mardell relocated from her home in London to Manchester - where the show is filmed. Before landing the job on Corrie Mardell's only other television credit was for an episode of Vera in 2017, since appearing on the show she has become the co-artistic director at the JunkBox Theatre in Manchester. Producer Kate Oates said that by having sex with Emma, David is \\"trying to find a way to hide in plain sight.\\" She added that David would credit having sex with Emma as \\"one of his big mistakes\\", but feels that it is a method of proving his masculinity. On her introduction, Mardell told Brown (Radio Times) that she found the experience \\"very surreal\\", but said that she \\"settled in quite quickly\\". As part of a new salon storyline, Mardell featured in scenes with Rula Lenska, who portrays rival hairdresser Claudia Colby. She enjoyed filming with Nicholls and Lenska and felt \\"spoilt\\" to share scenes with both actresses. Emma was also given a love interest in established character Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni), who is diagnosed HIV-positive. Mardell thought that Emma would be \\"open-minded\\" about Seb's diagnosis, but would not understand it properly. She also believed that there would be problems with Seb's former girlfriend, Faye Windass (Ellie Leach), who was still romantically interested in him. = Parental developments = Following Emma's first appearance on the show, many viewers began to pick up on the similarities between her and previous character Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin) last seen in September 1998; as both characters looked alike, worked at the salon and lived at 2a Coronation Street. Although, during an interview with The Sun, Mardell explained \\"I've heard the Fiona and Steve's daughter theory, but that's definitely not true. I did have a little chat and a joke with Angela Griffin about it and that was quite funny\\". However, the storyline later went ahead and Emma was revealed to be Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Fiona's daughter in August 2019. Despite the storyline going ahead, Fiona never returned to the street. Instead, she appeared to Emma from Australia via a video call in Episode 9854. However, Angela Griffin made a return to the street in real-life to film her scenes and spent time catching up with Nicholls and Mardell. After the parental developments were announced, some fans began theorising that a twist would see Emma turn out to be Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson)'s daughter instead of Steve's, due to his involvement with Fiona in the 90s. However, the show confirmed that Steve was her biological father when he received the DNA results in Episode 9853. In an interview, Mardell stated that she believed Emma would eventually come to terms with the revelation and \\"Isn't one to hold a grudge\\". Teasing her character's future, Mardell said: \\"No-one will ever replace her dad, but her mum lives in Australia and she doesn't have any other family on the Street so it would be a waste to let that relationship go. She bonds with Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) quite quickly, she's part of the McDonald family, they're taking her in. She's a McDonald now.\\"  Reception  For her portrayal of Emma, Mardell was nominated for Best Soap Newcomer at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards. She placed fifth with 7.7% of the total votes. She was also longlisted in the Best Newcomer category at the 2018 Inside Soap Awards. Mardell was nominated in the Newcomer category at the National Television Awards in 2019, and won Best Newcomer at the 2019 British Soap Awards.

She spent much of her adult life in Great Falls, Montana, but traveled throughout France and the United States.  Personal life  Josephine Hale was born in 1878 as Josephine Adeline Bruneau. The Bruneau family had eleven children, of which Hale was the youngest. Most of her siblings were born in Quebec however her family moved to the United States before Hale was born and settled near Sioux Point, South Dakota. In 1896 Hale graduated from a high school in Sioux City, Iowa. Two years later, at the age of twenty, Hale moved to Great Falls, MT where three of her siblings already lived. She began teaching in Eden, ten miles away from Great Falls, after passing her teacher certification test. The Montana Museum of Art and Culture states that it is likely she taught at \\"Canyon Schoolhouse, in the Eden area.\\" While in Great Falls, Josephine Hale met her husband, wealthy rancher Walter George Hale. The two married August 22, 1901 but the marriage lasted only three years. Walter Hale contracted and then died of tuberculosis. After her husband's death, Hale retained ownership of the ranch she had owned with him, and rented it to tenants as a source of income beginning in 1907. In 1910 Hale purchased a three-house lot in Great Falls which she used to board family members. She also created studio space in one of the attics. In 1917 Hale joined the Red Cross as a nurse to serve during WWI. While living in France, Hale met George Hepburn Robertson and fell in love. George Hepburn Robertson served as the Director of Transportation for the American Red Cross, which is likely where they met. Although Hale never married Robertson it is likely that part of her reason for returning to France later in life was to continue the relationship. She remained in France until 1926 when she returned to the US and began attending school for interior decoration. Hale returned to France less than a year later to continue her art education. In 1935 Hale moved back to Great Falls, MT where she lived during the Great Depression and WWII. During the ten years after her return from Europe she created a prolific amount of art work, she also continued nursing, a skill she had picked up in the Red Cross, for the rest of her life, including volunteering during WWII at Columbus Hospital. Hale died in 1961 at the age of 83.  Red Cross  World War I began in 1914, and in 1917 Josephine Hale enlisted in the Red Cross. At the time the Red Cross had an age limit on enlistment, and the forty year old Hale lied about her age, stating she was thirty-five, in order to enlist. Her ability to speak French was viewed as an asset and she paid for her own passage to Europe in order to ensure her acceptance. Hale traveled from New York to London aboard a transport vessel named the Corinthia. For protection her ship was accompanied by a cruiser, U-boat destroyers, airplanes and hydroplanes. After she arrived in London, Hale took a train to Paris. Hale's first assignment in France was in Paris at the Gara de l'Est canteen where she took medical classes and improved her language skills. After her training in Paris, Hale worked in canteens near the front, at Bordeaux. She would later open her own canteen in Marseilles. Hale wrote in her diary about her experiences working with soldiers: > \\"because of my knowledge of French I am assigned on the French and Belgian > side. They are so different from our boys and so very polite but they are > accustomed to being waited on so it is a bit harder on the waiter. They seem > very much pleased to have an American to talk and joke with them and how > they love to air every bit of English that they know. The Americans are all > about the same age, but the others range from 55 to 18 -- grey haired men > and fresh faced boys and everyone ready to smile back at you every chance > they get. It seems they take this war as their work and it is here to do.\\" Hale also recorded her experiences through at the front photography including images of damage caused by bombs at Fort de la Pompelle, a cathedral in ruins and the destruction of a forest. After Armistice, Hale extended her visa in order to continue working in devastated areas. In October 1920 she received her nursing degree from the Societe Francaise de Secours in Paris and in 1924 she was awarded the M√©daille de la Reconnaissance fran√ßaise by the French government.  Art  In early 1926 Hale moved to Boston and began attending courses at the New York School of Interior of Decoration. Her professors recommended that she pursue painting as a degree program. By October 14, 1926 Hale returned to Paris in order to continue studying interior design but the next year she began attending the Acad√©mie Del√©cluse, where she began her full-time study of painting and drawing. At the academy she studied under Auguste Del√©cluse, Eugene Del√©cluse, De Courmon and Jean-Paul Laurens. Later, she would describe her time studying art in France as \\"the happiest years of my life.\\" Following nine years improving her skills, Hale received accolades in the Salon of 1934 and was invited to galleries and arts organizations. Hale produced paintings with a wide variety of subjects including still lifes, florals, landscapes, portraits and nudes. Stylistically she was influenced by her experience with interior design in her use of fabric and floral patterns, French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Fauves use of animated lines in landscapes, and the European tradition of plein air painting. She also consistently referenced the book The Art Spirit by Robert Henri in her sketchbooks. Hale built her body of work by travelling extensively including visits to French Brittany, Monaco, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Morocco, the Sonoran Desert and Mexico. In 1995 Vivian Ellis and Fran Walton gifted the Josephine Hale art collection to the Montana Museum of Art and Culture, which is the primary repository of her work. MMAC exhibit \\"Intimate West: Women Artists in Montana 1880-1944.\\" The goal of the exhibit was to show a different interpretation of the American West than the traditional representations by artists like C.M. Russel and Edgar S. Paxson. Hale's works in the exhibit include studies and images of Glacier National Park that are described as \\"long, thoughtful studies of the natural world\\" by MMAC curator Jeremy Camwell. Hale was also the subject of an exhibit, \\"The Life and Art of Josephine Hale, 1878-1961,\\" at the Hockaday Museum of Art.

These are the earliest novels on record written by an African-American woman from Texas. Horace married and divorced twice, and continued to teach, travel and write throughout her life. At the time of her retirement, she had been an educator for over thirty years.  Biography  = Early life and education = Lillian Bertha Amstead (or Armistead) was born April 29, 1880 in Jefferson, Texas to Thomas Amstead (or Armistead) and Macey Ackard Matthews; she also had one sister, Etta. The family moved to Fort Worth when Lillian was two years old. Thomas failed to support them financially, so the girls grew up helping their mother make ends meet. A self- described \\"dreamy\\" and \\"mystical\\" child, Lillian attended the East Ninth Street Colored School (renamed I.M. Terrell High School in 1921), the first free public school in Fort Worth, and Mt. Gilead Baptist Church. She attended several colleges and universities, including historically black colleges in the Jim Crow south. In 1898-99, Lillian attended Bishop College, a historically black college founded by the Baptist Home Mission Society in Marshall, Texas, which she credited with her commitment to the Baptist faith. Lillian attended the Dallas Summer Normal Institute, a segregated teacher education program, in 1905. In 1914, she enrolled at Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College (now Prairie View A&M; University) and graduated valedictorian in a class of seventy-four. Returning to Fort Worth to teach during the school year, Lillian attended summer courses at the University of Chicago in 1917, 1918, 1919, 1928, and 1940; at the University of Colorado Boulder in 1920; and at Columbia University in 1924. In 1920‚Äì1921, she attended Simmons College in Louisville, Kentucky, where she earned her Bachelor's degree in 1922. While at Simmons College, she held the position of Dean of Women. Jones would later return to the University of Chicago in 1940 to study for a master's degree in Library Science. = Career = After attending university, Horace moved back to the South and married David Jones, the son of her pastor Reverend Prince Jones. For the first few years of their marriage, they lived with his family in Denton. During this time, she studied for and passed her teaching exams, and took up her first teaching position in 1901 at a school in the rural community of Parvin in Denton County, Texas. The following year, she was named principal of the Handley Colored School, a one- room school in the Handley community east of Fort Worth. In 1911, Lillian returned to I.M. Terrell High School to teach English. During her long teaching career at I.M. Terrell, she established the school's journalism and drama departments, started a School Newspaper at I. M. Terrell called Terrellife, and formed the school's first library using donations from parents. For many years, she served as the school's dean of girls. Though teaching was her career, Lillian's greatest wish was \\"to write a book worth reading by an intelligent person, not necessarily [her] friend.\\" In 1916, Lillian self-published her first book of utopian fiction, Five Generations Hence, the first known novel by an African-American woman in Texas. The plot of the migration narrative, centering on fictional African-American educator Grace Noble, presents African-American women as heroines and the return of black Americans to Africa as a \\"plausible solution to the obstacles facing blacks in the South\\", five generations after their enslavement and transport to the Americas. The book was not widely distributed, but came to scholars' attention in 1995 when it was excerpted in Daring to Dream: Utopian Stories by United States Women, 1836-1919. In 1938, Lillian began writing a biography of Dr. Lacey Kirk Williams, the minister of Chicago's Olivet Baptist Church, then the largest church in the United States with a congregation of 12,000. He had been a minister at Lillian's own Mt. Gilead Baptist Church in Fort Worth prior to moving to Chicago. Williams was killed in a plane crash in 1940, and although Lillian finished the book the following year, power struggles within the National Baptist Convention prevented distribution of the book until 1964, when it gained the attention of Martin Luther King Jr. \\"Crowned with Glory and Honor\\": The Life of Rev. Lacey Kirk Williams was published posthumously in 1978. Lillian's second novel, Angie Brown, was written while traveling between Texas and California after her divorce from her second husband. Rather than presenting emigration to Africa as a solution to American racial struggles, Angie Brown focuses on the women's shared experience and envisions \\"cooperation between black and white women\\". Angie Brown: A Jim Crow Romance was published posthumously in 2017. = Personal life = Lillian B. Horace was a member of the Texas Commission on Interracial Cooperation, Zeta Phi Beta sorority, Alphin Art & Charity Club, Progressive Women's Club, Women's Council of Mt. Gilead, Heroines of Jericho, and Order of the Eastern Star; she also served as chaplain of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs. She was also involved with the Texas Library Association and the National PTA. As a local civic leader and longtime educator at the \\"separate but superior\\" I.M. Terrell High School, Lillian was a significant influence on local African American women like educator Hazel Harvey Peace and civil rights activist Lulu B. White. Both of Lillian's marriages ended in divorce, strained by her professional and personal ambitions. Lillian married David Jones, the son of her pastor at Mt. Gilead Baptist Church, in 1900; the couple divorced in 1919. She married Joseph Gentry Horace, a native of the small East Texas town of Groveton, in 1930. A recent widower seven years younger than Lillian, J. Gentry was an employee at Swift & Co. in the Fort Worth Stockyards whom she probably met at church. With her support, he enrolled in the Bishop College seminary in 1935. The couple relocated to the Chicago area when he transferred to Northern Seminary five years later, earning his bachelor's degree in 1942 and master's degree in theology in 1943. J. Gentry became a minister at the Second Baptist Church of Evanston, Illinois; contrary to his congregation's expectations of a minister's wife, Lillian divided her time between Fort Worth and Evanston, continuing to teach at I.M. Terrell during the school year. After his mistress's husband exposed J. Gentry's longstanding affair with a local woman, Portia Cooke, he moved to another church and Lillian returned to Fort Worth after some time spent traveling in the west of the country. Their divorce was finalized in 1946. J. Gentry subsequently married Cooke in 1951. Lillian had no children with Jones or Horace. She died of heart disease at a Fort Worth nursing home on August 6, 1965 and was buried at Old Trinity Cemetery,Ancestry.com. Texas, Death Certificates, 1903‚Äì1982 [database on- line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2013. the African- American section of Fort Worth's historic Oakwood Cemetery. Her funeral was held on August 9, 1965. Those in attendance included members of the many organizations Horace was a part of, including the Zeta Phi Beta sorority, Heroines of Jericho, Progressive Woman's Club, Viola Court No. 250 and Alphin Charity and Literary Arts Club.  Literary works  =Literary legacy= Lillian Bertha Jones Horace's literary works were lost for many decades until Karen Kossie-Chernyshev, a professor at Texas Southern University, located her diary and novels at Fort Worth Public Library. She was one of the only African American women writers working in the South during the 1940s. Scholars have argued that the category of Southern Literature has very few works by Black authors. Historians have viewed Horace's work as a way to widen this category. During the early to mid 1900s, the South upheld Jim Crow Laws. As an African American woman, Horace's freedom was limited under these laws which Dr. Veronica Watson argues influenced her work. In the diaries found by Kossie- Chernyshev, she wrote about everything from politics and war to her personal life. Her entries included some personal experiences with what she considered to be discrimination. For example, after a white woman stole shoes from her while she was at the store, and an employee refused to help her, Horace wrote: > The floorwalker, Mr. Weed, hurts my feelings. I lie awake and suffer much of > the night. I want to say things to him not vulgar things but things to show > how inconsiderate he was in a crisis. Shoes gone-- money and coupon \\"17\\"-- > but I suffer only for the insult I received. The first time I feel > unpatriotic‚Äîjust a dark face makes you the recipient of any insult. Themes of oppression and discrimination are present in her novels as well. Horace, similarly to Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes, used her writing to expose and critique white supremacy. She is one of the few African American Women to do so during this time period. Horace's work adds to the knowledge scholars have of the ways in which Black female authors engaged with the concept of whiteness. Other influences on her work include Richard Wright's autobiography Black Boy. She wrote many entries in her diary about it in which she complimented his writing style. However, she also critiqued his work for its portrayal of African Americans, which she thought to be too negative. Throughout her life, Horace wrote at least three novels. These include Five Generations Hence, Crowned with Glory and Honor, and Angie Brown. Although Horace had a lengthy and successful teaching career, from a young age she desired to write. She did not achieve much recognition for her writing during her life, but after her novels were rediscovered, several essays were written which focus on her work. They were then compiled in the book Recovering Five Generations Hence: The Life and Writing of Lillian Jones Horace, which includes her novel Five Generations Hence. = Five Generations Hence = Five Generations Hence, written in 1916, was Horace's first novel, which she self- published due to her work being rejected many times. She co-owned the publishing company that she used, Dotson Publishing Co. This novel was lost for many years until Carol Kessler included an excerpt of it in her novel Daring to Dream, written in 1996. Horace's is the first known utopian novel written by an African American. Both of the protagonists of this novel, Grace Noble, a teacher, and Violet Gray, a missionary, are Black Women. Gray describes herself as the \\"advance guard of a mighty nation\\" while Noble is characterized as \\"truest and best type.\\" By centering her story around Black Female characters, some of whom were intellectuals, Horace provided a picture of black womanhood that challenged stereotypes of black women, including the idea that they were promiscuous and foul-mouthed. Her premise puts forth emigrating to Africa as a solution to the discrimination faced by black people in the United States. = Crowned with Glory and Honor = Crowned with Glory and Honor (written in 1943) is a biography of Reverend Lacey Kirk Williams, a prominent pastor and president of the National Baptist Convention (NBC), 1922‚Äì1940. Reverend Williams died just as Horace was finishing this novel, which created tension between leaders of the NBC. At this time, Horace was unable to convince them to publish the Reverend's biography. However, many years later at a meeting of the Progressive National Baptists Convention Inc. (PBC) Horace shared her novel. In 1978, thirteen years after Horace's death, a leader of the PBC, L. Vencheal Booth, published her work. = Angie Brown = Angie Brown, written in 1949, was Horace's third novel. She unsuccessfully attempted to have it published by New York-based publisher Lemuel L. Foster. This novel includes themes of interracial cooperation, focusing specifically on black and white women. The protagonist, Angie Brown, is an African American Woman who experiences the death of her infant soon after her husband leaves her. One of the only interns who would see Black patients at a nearby segregated hospital did not return from an extended lunch in time to treat her child. A devastated Angie begins a journey that takes her far away from home where she finds support from both black and white women. In turn, she is a positive influence on those around her.

She is known for the images she made during and after her MFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York, exploring ideas of dislocation as well as the form and psyche of contemporary living.  Biography  = Early life = Xing Danwen was born in 1967 in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China. Her parents worked as engineers in a state-owned energy company. = Education = The artist started her visual art practice with painting medium in her teens. From 1982‚Äì1986, she studied painting at the art school affiliated to Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts. From 1989‚Äì1992, she continued painting and earned her BFA in oil painting at the Central Academy of Fine Art. In the late 1980s, she was drawn to photography. Self-taught in photography, she was one of a few artists in the late '80s and '90s in China exploring the boundaries of photography and using photography as an art form. Through the camera, she observed and challenged the questions on Chinese society, humanity, female identity and the generation born in the '60s. Xing documented the performance art movement among the East Village artists in Beijing in the early 1990s. In 1998, she went to New York with a grant and fellowship from the Asian Cultural Council, New York. There, she did her MFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York with a chairman grant from SVA from 1998‚Äì2001. This New York period challenged and enriched her artistic experience. In her current art practice she works, besides photography, also in the field of mixed media, video and multi-media installations. Her artistic practice is both rich and varied and her subjects include: Dislocation between cultural status, conflicts between globalization and traditions, problematic environmental issues, the urban drama between the desire and reality. Fiction, truth and illusion often play an important role in her works. = Career = One of Xing's first major works was the series disConnexion (2002‚Äì03), large-scale photographs of wires, circuit boards, and other computer waste exported from the United States to China's Guangdong Province. Xing began her series Urban Fiction in 2004, which features photographs of architectural maquettes that Xing encountered at real- estate developers‚Äô offices into which she inserted cutout figures that are enacting a scene of domestic drama. Urban Fiction has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as part of the exhibition \\"Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China\\", and at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies. In 2007, Xing continued her exploration of urban architecture and her relationship to the city of Beijing through the series Wall House.  Major artworks  = A Personal Diary = 1993‚Äì2003, Photographs In A Personal Diary, Xing presents a highly poetic work that evinces her acute ability to inscribe China's alternative art scene in the 1990s into her own personal narrative. We see the city through an eye disturbed by rapid urban development. It calls artists and their artworks from their studios to the streets, it witnesses the emergence of installation art in public spaces, and it accompanies and connects with performers in private apartments, evincing a strong, sensual closeness to them. The camera is frequently visible in the photographs, and so is the artist herself, as she captures people and events with an unmistakable passion for what is portrayed. = Born with Cultural Revolution = 1995, B/W Photographs. Featured in ANU /Verso 2019 publication Afterlives of Chinese Communism edited by Christian Sorace, Ivan Fraceschini, nad Nicholas Lumbere. = I am a woman = 1994‚Äì1996, B/W Photographs = SCROLL = 1999‚Äì2000, B/W Photographs Scroll is a series of panoramic photos of Beijing composed of many images that were shot in succession on 120 mm film. This method resulted in photos that are exceptionally long, narrow, and horizontal. The images were shot manually, without any computer manipulation or digitization. Danwen Xing relied on the film's original data, which she assembles into the final work. Scroll A focuses on daily life and human activities in public spaces and Scroll B captures scenes of Beijing streets and buildings, resulting in haunting and poetic abstract images. = Sleep walking = 2001, two-channel video installation In Sleep Walking, Xing examines the effect of dislocation and how the mind can blur the distinctions between the past and the present, reality and fiction. The video weaves together images from different Western cityscapes accompanied by a soundtrack composed with Chinese traditional instruments and sounds of daily life in Chinese cities. The work implies a sense of loss and displacement, and evokes contending memories. Xing reconstructs reality, creating vigorous images infused with her visions of European Old Master paintings, the realities of these cities, and personal audial and visual memories. = disCONNEXION = 2002‚Äì2003, Color Photographs Xing's concerns are not only related to large cities. She has traveled to southern China to explore the effects of electronic trash recycling on villages and small cities in the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province. In disCONNEXION, her critical eye and sharp lens examine the aesthetics of technological waste, reflecting environmental concerns, but more importantly, an anxiety about changes in the lives of workers along the south coast, whose ghosts can be sensed despite their absence from the frames. = Duplication = 2003, Color Photographs DUPLICATION is a photography series staged in different toy factories across South China. Danwen Xing observed the entire toy production process and how designs are made for the international market to match the desires of people in every corner of the world. The toys are made to represent ideal beauty, but Xing deconstructs this by focusing her critical lens on the process and exploring the aesthetics of the identical parts. Although the photos show only a fraction of the huge quantities of toy parts made in the factories, the work urges the eye to examine their differences and search for individuality. = Urban Fiction = 2004‚Äìpresent, photography with digital manipulation In Urban Fiction, the city becomes unreal, synthetic, and almost empty of its inhabitants. The artist inserts theatrical scenes into a series of photographs of promotional models used by real estate companies, with her as the main actor in playful, fictitious incidents. Hovering between reality and fantasy, the scenes compensate for the sense of emptiness in exponentially-expanding cities. = Wall House = 2007, Multimedia installation with photographs and video projection In Wall House, Xing stages herself inside a building designed by John Hejduk in the Netherlands, and her lonely presence draws its magic from the urban landscapes of Chinese cities seen from the windows of the space. Captivated by her passion for the city, she summons it, and questions the reality of the borders between public, private, and subjective spaces. = Because I am in the Mountains = 2017, Installation with coal-coke and mixed materials This sculpture presents a panoramic miniature of a contemporary landscape made from coal coke, the synthetic material that results from burning coal. In this work, Danwen Xing creates a contrast between the polluting medium and the scene depicted. Confusion is triggered by the divergence between the apparent disaster that is contemporary life and the beautiful vision of a natural landscape from traditional Chinese ink art. Xing expresses clear concern for the threatened nature, but more importantly, she borrows a phrase from Chinese philosophy: standing on Mount Lu means that one cannot see its true face. She engages with a visible symbolic complex, recognizing that it is impossible to observe objectively when we are lost within ourselves. = Thread = 2017, Two- channel video with Sound, HD, 10 mins In this new work, Thread, Xing examines the complexity of communication and connection between people. The artist and her mother serve as the main characters. On one screen are the aged hands of the artist‚Äôs mother, insistently knitting a dress with love and care, and on the other, the daughter wears the dress as it unravels with her movement. A feeling of liberation is evoked as the daughter‚Äôs body slowly becomes exposed but also fragile, and vulnerable. The daughter is trapped in the thread, but she moves forward with an uncontrolled drive. Although the two actions are separate and seem contradictory, the viewer senses a complicity between mother and daughter, as if they share an unspoken, secret understanding.

It is one of fourteen sculptures commissioned by the guilds of FlorencePaola Grifoni, Francesca Nannelli, Le statue dei santi protettori delle arti fiorentine e il Museo di Orsanmichele, Quaderni del servizio educativo, Edizioni Polistampa, Florence, 2006. to decorate the external niches of the Orsanmichele church. St. George was commissioned by the guild of the armorers and sword makers, the Arte dei Corazzai e Spadai. A stone thrown at the sculpture in 1858 broke its nose, and in 1892 Donatello's St. George was moved to the Bargello Museum in Florence. From 1892 to 2008 a bronze replica was placed in the original niche, to be replaced by a marble replica on 23 April 2008. The original sculpture was stolen from the Villa Medici in Poggio a Caiano, but in May 1945 it was recovered by Frederick Hart in Neumelans and returned to Italy on 20 July 1945. The box base was added back onto the statue in 1976.  Description  Saint George is sculptured as a young, brave, determined and strong man in armor. He is standing in contrapposto, his right leg is turned to the same angle as his shield. Even though he is fully clothed, there is still the sense of a muscular body underneath. His right hand originally probably held some sort of a blade. Drill marks on his head indicate, that he probably also wore some kind of helmet or wreath. St Georges eyes are looking up and his face indicates some kind of anxiety and emotionality before attacking the dragon (as in the biblical story). His eyebrows are knit together and there are wrinkles in his forehead. = Relief = There is a stone relief under the figure, that is displaying woman observing St George slaying the dragon in the middle. There is a cave on the right, colonnade on the left and the relief also has a background with trees. The closets objects are carved in relatively high relief, whereas the cave, the colonnade and the background trees are carved in low relief. This technique is called Stiacciato.

The Madonna of the Rose (Italian - Madonna della Rosa) is a 2.2 metre high marble sculpture of the Madonna and Child enthroned, with the Child trying to take a bunch of rosa canina from his mother's hand. Paola Grifoni, Francesca Nannelli, Le statue dei santi protettori delle arti fiorentine e il Museo di Orsanmichele, Quaderni del servizio educativo, Edizioni Polistampa, Firenze 2006. It forms part of a cycle of fourteen sculptures of the patron saints of the guilds of Florence on the external niches of the Orsanmichele church. No documents survive to precisely date it, leading to several theories and attributions. Most art historians attribute it to Pietro di Giovanni Tedesco, a German or Flemish sculptor active in Florence in the sculpture-yard of Florence Cathedral. It shows similarities to late works from the school of Giotto. A Latin inscription on the base of the niche records damage to the sculpture in 1493 - Mary was the protector of Florence and the person who damaged the sculpture was sentenced to death. The Madonna was commissioned by the 'Arte dei Medici e Speziali' and completed around 1399. An object of great popular devotion, it was moved inside the church in 1628, meaning it is in a much better condition than the other thirteen sculptures in the cycle. It is now in the Museo di Orsanmichele, although a copy fills its original external niche, which had been used from 1858 until 1891 for Saint George by Donatello. It was restored in 1996, revealing it had possibly originally been painted.

He was born before 1386. Life According to Lorenzo Ghiberti, he owed his nickname 'Tedesco' to his origins in Germany or (according to others) in the Duchy of Brabant. He is first recorded in Florence in 1386 - there he worked on Florence Cathedral up until 1399 and a document dated 5 September 1387 from its records shows a payment to the painter Lorenzo di Bicci for designing a sculpture for Piero Tedesco to carve. He also worked on Milan Cathedral and in 1402 he is recorded as working on the font in Orvieto Cathedral. The c.1399 Madonna of the Rose is attributed to him.

It is also known colloquially by the metonym Chausseestra√üe. Established during the early Cold War, the Federal Intelligence Service is the western world's second largest intelligence agency, second only to its close partner, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States. History The complex is designed by the architect firm Kleihues + Kleihues. Construction started in 2006 and was completed in 2017. With 260,000 m¬≤ it is the world's largest intelligence headquarters, somewhat bigger than the CIA headquarters at Langley, and around 4,000 people work there.

BND headquarters in Berlin The headquarters is located near the former trace of the Berlin Wall, on the eastern side, some 350 meters from the canal which marked the border to West Berlin during the Cold War, and directly adjacent to the former Chausseestra√üe crossing point. Following the decision to build the new BND headquarters there, a massive urban renewal has taken place in the neighbourhood, with many new construction projects opposite the BND headquarters, including high-end apartment buildings, a new park, the Caf√© Top Secret, a new hotel, and buildings housing office spaces and retail stores. The headquarters includes a visitor center that is open to the public; it is the first intelligence organisation to have such a center. Although completed in 2017, the official opening was held in February 2019. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany attended and made this statement: \\"In an often very confusing world, now, more urgently than ever, Germany needs a strong and efficient foreign intelligence service\\". At the time, some 4,000 employees were expected to work from this location, moving here from the former headquarters in a suburb of Munich.

The painting depicts a domestic scene in which a Nair woman adorning her hair with a garland of flowers in front of a mirror. The painting was notable for being the first major award-winning work that Ravi Varma had completed. Receiving praise at the international and national level, the painting had brought the young Ravi Varma into the attention of the global artistic community, as well as leading him on to later become one of the most well known modern Indian painters. Background Raja Ravi Varma was born on 1848 in Kerala, India. Ravi Varma was primarily known for incorporating Hindu themes and ideals with European styles. Varma was one of the first Indian artists to make use of oil painting and lithographic methods. Ravi Varma was first exposed to European methods of painting when he watched a Dutch painter when he arrived to do some paintings for the palace. Through trial and error, Ravi Varma had learned rudimentary techniques of oil painting. After deciding that painting would be a full-time profession, he had gone on to do some portraits and other small tasks for important local people. After returning to Trivandrum, Varma had been commissioned to do oil paintings for the Travancore Royal Court. After receiving an award for this task, he had gone on to paint The Nair Lady Adorning Her Hair, which was to be his first point of recognition in the national and international level. Subject and themes Although Ravi Varma was trained in the European styles of painting‚Äî‚Äîemploying the techniques for illusionism and oil painting‚Äî‚ÄîRavi Varma's style was primarily Malayali. The painting's subject includes a Nair lady adorning her hair in front of a mirror within a familiar household setting. Ravi Varma used techniques that used realism, but evoked styles from European artists such as Botticelli and Renoir. A common theme found in Ravi Varma's paintings are that of domesticity and female beauty, based on native values. Ravi Varma's paintings of Nair women in general were seen as part of a turning point in the discourse on female sexuality within the matrilineal context. It has been described that a notable feature about Ravi Varma's paintings of such women were the passive beauty and unerotic sensuality. Of even greater significance was the image of domesticity that Ravi Varma had presented. Exhibition The painting was awarded the first prize, the prestigious Governor's Gold Medal, when it was presented at the Madras Fine Arts Society Exhibition of 1873, bringing Raja Ravi Varma into the limelight. He also received a Certificate of Merit at the International Exhibition held in Vienna for the painting.

Taussig (1872-1943) was an American gynecologist and professor of clinical obstetrics at Washington University School of Medicine. In the 1930s he was an influential advocate of legalization of abortion. Life and work Frederick Taussig earned an A.B. at Harvard in 1893 and an M.D. at the Washington University School of Medicine (then called the St. Louis Medical College). He interned at the St. Louis City Hospital for Women and then at the Imperial and Royal Elizabeth Hospital in Vienna. In the early years of the 20th century, concerned about the large number of indigent cancer patients, he helped treat them and lobbied George D. Barnard to fund what became the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital. In 1909 he helped found a national association for social hygiene, and in 1910 he wrote the first medical monograph devoted entirely to abortion. in In addition to the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital, Taussig saw patients at the Washington University Hospital, the St. Louis City Hospital, the St. Louis Maternity Hospital, the New Jewish Hospital, and the Barnes Hospital. Many of his research papers -- concerning such subjects as abortion and cancer of the vulva, cervix and vagina -- were based on observations at those hospitals. In 1933 Taussig joined with colleagues Robert Crossen, Frances Stewart, and Lesley Patton to organize the first birth control clinic in St. Louis. In 1943 the clinic was renamed the Planned Parenthood Clinic of Missouri. Taussig was also on the board of directors at the National Committee on Maternal Health and the National Committee for Maternal Welfare. The medical researcher Edmund Cowdry said that Taussig's 1936 book Abortion, Spontaneous and Induced: Medical and Social Aspects is \\"a classic recognized by medical men and sociologists alike,\\" and Mary Calderone of Planned Parenthood cited the book as a pioneering work.. Robert Latou Dickinson wrote about the book that it \\"renders service that is fundamental.\\" Views on women and abortion Early in his career, Frederick Taussig was opposed to abortion. His 1910 book called widespread abortion \\"wholesale slaughter of the innocents.\\" In the book he counseled his fellow physicians to be wary of women who exaggerate their difficulties in pregnancy in order to convince their doctors to give them a therapeutic abortion. However, by 1936, when Taussig wrote his most famous treatise on abortion, his views had changed. Authors who support legal access to safe abortions have credited Taussig with being an important voice for legalization in the 1930s, in part because, as an eminent physician who was not associated with the radical movements of the time, he had credibility among the more conservative sections of the public. \\"The detailed scientific and medical content of Taussig's book, together with its moderate political stance, made it the standard authority on abortion for decades.\\" Opponents of legalized abortion have concurred with this assessment; Marvin Olasky, the editor-in-chief of the Christian evangelical magazine World, has called Taussig's Abortion, Spontaneous and Induced \\"the most effective pro-abortion book of the 1930s.\\", accessed 30 March 2018. By the 1930s Taussig had also changed his attitude toward women. Rather than advising doctors to expect deviousness from women as he had done in the 1910 volume, he drew contrasts between the skill of midwives and the clumsiness of doctors whose sharp instruments often caused perforations of the uterus. He wrote that the increase in injury and death because of perforations over the previous fifty years was largely the result of \\"the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives.\\" Some passages in the 1936 book explicitly support greater rights for women: Both Taussig's wife Florence Gottschalk and his daughter Mary Taussig Hall were active in women's rights and other progressive movements, in the latter case starting in 1916 at age 5, when she walked with her mother at the head of a demonstration by 7,000 women demanding the right to vote., accessed 30 March 2018.

His provocative hybrid painting of Chairman Mao Zedong and Donald Trump was featured in the Chinese edition of New York Times. Bennett's work has been illustrated and discussed in publications including Vogue and the Huffington Post and exhibited internationally at art fairs including Art Basel.  Early history  Bennett is a self-taught artist from Asbury Park, New Jersey. In 2014, he relocated to Los Angeles. Motivated by an entrepreneurial spirit and interest in art history, Bennett started collecting fine art and taught himself various production processes, including photography and silk- screening.  Canvas art  The subject of Bennett's art often surrounds appropriated photographs of famous creatives that he alters in different ways to emphasize social issues, like racism and identity politics, that plague American society. His production techniques, use of the same image in serial repetition, and even some of the images themselves, are inspired by Andy Warhol. = Obama Cowboy, 2012 = In 2012, Bennett began working with appropriation techniques and quotations of Warhol in his series Obama Cowboy. Here Bennett replaces the face of Elvis Presley in Warhol's Elvis (Cowboy), 1963 with the face of President Obama. This re-purposing introduces the conversation of race into the image and explores matters of gun culture, gun control and the meaning of the Second Amendment in contemporary society. = Cojones, 2014 = For this series, Bennett appropriates the famous 1989 photograph taken by Janette Beckman of the rapper Slick Rick grabbing his groin, keeping the body and altering the meaning of the image by changing the face, Using historic and contemporary figures . In his new iteration of the image, Bennett emphasizes the defiance and courage of the icons he selects. In 2016, Bennett exhibited several paintings from his Cojones series at Art Southampton on Long Island. = Share a Coke (Coke Bottle), 2015 = 2015 marked the centennial of Coca-Cola‚Äôs revolutionary bottle design. Bennett took this opportunity to celebrate not only the company but also Warhol's iconic image of the Coca-Cola bottle, updating the design to reflect its contemporary branding. Bennett first exhibited works from this series during SCOPE Art Show. = Mao Trump, 2015 = To maximize his political statement, Bennett combined an image of Chairman Mao Zedong originally silk-screened by Andy Warhol in 1972 with an image of then-American businessman Donald Trump who later announced his intention to run for public office. For Bennett, this controversial image illustrates the perils of power as it pertains to both Eastern and Western political, cultural, and economic systems. = Orange is the New Black, 2016 = In the series Orange is the New Black, Bennett's most political to date, Bennett uses his signature silk-screening technique and serial formats to engage in a conversation surrounding institutional racism and continued disruption within the black community in America. Utilizing images of highly politicized figures and printing them in an orange color reminiscent of prison jumpsuits, Bennett identifies factual wrongdoing and abuse dating back to the 1930s.

Nnamdi Azikiwe, the leader of opposition in the Western region, moved to the east where he contested and won election in Onitsha, his hometown. Azikiwe became the new premier with support of legislators including Eyo who was appointed Chief Whip and chairman of the Eastern Region Development Company. Towards the end of 1956, Eyo and Azikiwe had a fallout, Eyo then petitioned the colonial government to probe the role of the premier in the affairs of a private bank. When a fresh election was called, Eyo joined the Action Group and was elected, he was now as a member of the opposition with a primary focus on the creation of a Calabar, Ogoja and Rivers (COR) State. When a Southeastern State was created, Eyo was a commissioner under the military administration of Esuene. In 1977, he was a councilor representing Uyo and later joined Great Nigeria People's Party during the Second Nigerian Republic.

He is one of the most successful high school basketball coaches in the U.S. state of Georgia. After surviving both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute leukemia, Marelle started speaking publicly about his experience in Georgia and the national high school and college basketball communities. Career and education Marelle was named head basketball coach at Duluth High School in 1981, where he coached for 19 seasons. He also was the school's athletic director from 1991 to 2001. During his tenure, his teams won four Georgia state sub-region championships, and in 1985 he led his team to the semifinals of the Georgia Class AA tournament. Marelle was named the Gwinnett County Coach of the Year in 1985, 1986, and 1995. Marelle also worked as the head coach of Mount Pisgah Christian School from 2005 to 2007, a tenure that included a Class AAA state championship in his first year as head coach, and a 30-9 record over that span. After working at Mount Pisgah, Marelle transitioned to an assistant coaching role at Greater Atlanta Christian School, where he coached from 2009 to 2014 and helped the school compile a 121-9 record during those years. Marelle graduated from the University of North Florida with a degree in physical education and earned a master's degree from the University of Tennessee in 1975. Cancer diagnosis Marelle was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 after experiencing severe pain during a trip to San Antonio, Texas where he was a coach at the National Basketball Coaches Association's Final Four. He was diagnosed with a supposedly incurable form of Stage 4 Non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma and given only six months to live. He underwent six years of chemotherapy treatments which eventually put his lymphoma into remission, but which also contributed to his second cancer diagnosis of acute leukemia. Marelle was given a life-saving experimental bone marrow transplant from his oldest son and was able to return to coaching in 2005 as head coach at Mount Pisgah Christian School. Motivational speaking & philanthropy After his cancer's remission, Marelle was approached by Coaches vs. Cancer, a nationwide collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the National Association of Basketball Coaches, to give a speech about his life. He accepted the invitation and went on to host a Coaches vs. Cancer fundraiser, auctioning pieces of sports memorabilia. The auction raised more than $10,000 for the American Cancer Society. Marelle's experiences were the subject of the book Coaching To Defeat Cancer, which discusses the success stories of nine basketball coaches and cancer survivors. Marelle's wife Kathy Marelle helped to plan \\"Brylee's Bash in the Park\\", a fundraiser for another Duluth family with a family member undergoing cancer treatment. Marelle sent a letter to Larry Shyatt, then the head coach at Clemson University, in which he relayed his health situation and urged Shyatt and his players to keeping fighting hard in the midst of an eight-game losing streak during the 2000 to 2001 season. Shyatt read the letter to his team before their first game. A few days later, Clemson upset number-one ranked North Carolina for the second time in the school's history. Awards and recognition Marelle was presented an autographed ball from the American Cancer Society for his involvement with Coaches vs. Cancer awareness. Representative Brooks Coleman initiated a resolution in the Georgia State House of Representatives to commend Marelle for his outstanding coaching career and for inspiring others with his approach to battling cancer. The Gwinnett Country Tip Off Club named an annual award after Marelle, calling it the Joe Marelle Courage Award. The award is presented to an outstanding player who has overcome health problems or other obstacles. In 2003, a new gym at Duluth High School was dedicated and named in honor of Marelle. The American Cancer Society's Coaches vs. Cancer named Marelle their \\"National Coach of the Year\\" in 2004, and Marelle spoke at the 2004 NCAA Final Four tournament to both coaches and players. Marelle was named the 2005 to 2006 Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Coach of the Year.

Arkansas voters chose nine representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic ‚ÄúSolid South‚Äù state.See Urwin, Cathy Kunzinger; Agenda for Reform: Winthrop Rockefeller as Governor of Arkansas, 1967-71, p. 32 Disfranchisement of effectively all Negroes and most poor whites had meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections. The 1920s did see a minor change in this, as increased voting by poor Ozark whites as a protest against Woodrow Wilson's internationalist foreign policy meant that Warren G. Harding was able to win almost forty percent of the statewide vote;Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 211, 287 however despite his national landslide Calvin Coolidge in 1924 could not do any more than win the two traditional Unionist GOP counties. 1928 saw the rest of the Outer South and North Alabama bolt the anti-Prohibition Catholic Al Smith, but the presence of Arkansas Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson as running mate meant that within Arkansas only the most northwesterly counties with ordinarily substantial Republican votes would suffer the same fate.Barnes, Kenneth C.; Anti-Catholicism in Arkansas: How Politicians, the Press, the Klan, and Religious Leaders Imagined an Enemy, 1910‚Äì1960, pp. 164-165 The following years saw Arkansas plunge into the Great Depression, followed almost immediately by a major drought from the summer of 1930s until the winter of 1931/1932.Whayne, Jeannie M.; DeBlack, Thomas A.; Sabo, George and Arnold, Morris S.; Arkansas: A Narrative History, pp. 341-342 This came on top of a long depression in agriculture, which was still the dominant player in Arkansas‚Äô economy and was backed up by the ‚ÄúGreat Migration‚Äù of the state's agricultural labor force to northeastern and midwestern cities.Whayne, DeBlack, Sabo and Arnold; Arkansas, pp. 313-316 Arkansas gave extremely heavy support to Democrat Franklin Roosevelt in the 1932 election.Grantham, Dewey W.; The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History, p. 102 Roosevelt won every county in the state, becoming the first Democrat to win Searcy County since before the Civil War and only the second to win adjacent Newton County.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 87 Throughout his first term as President, Roosevelt was extremely popular in the ‚ÄúSolid South‚ÄùLeuchtenburg, William E.; The White House Looks South: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, p. 51 and despite embryonic concerns over loss of southern control of the national party due to abolition of the ‚Äútwo-thirds‚Äù ruleFrederickson, Kari A.; The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932-1968, p. 24 and some hostility to FDR's repeal of ProhibitionMenendez; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, p. 64 he was overwhelmingly and in many places almost unanimously supported by Arkansas‚Äô limited electorate. Ozark Republican Landon did regain the two Unionist and Prohibitionist Ozark counties, but topped 40% in only two of the remaining seventy-three.

It was the longest route in the Italian colonial empire in Africa and \\"the jewel in Ala Littoria's crown\\".Caprotti, \\"Imagining Ethiopia\\", pp. 388‚Äì90. It connected Rome with Benghazi (Libya), Asmara (Eritrea), Addis Abeba (Ethiopia) and Mogadishu (Somalia). It carried passengers and mail. Italy ultimately lost control of the route during World War II. According to Federico Caprotti, \\"The celebration of colonial air links ... can be seen as playing into modern connotations of speed, progress, and reach, as well as aspirations to superiority. ... [T]he geographical imaginations evinced through the airline's documents and visual materials are deeply modern in their celebration of technological prowess and the domination of nature and space.\\" Development Ala Littoria's service to East Africa was inaugurated in 1935 under the name Linea dell'Impero. On 7 July 1935 a memorandum of agreement was signed with Imperial Airways, a private British firm, whereby they would carry Ala Littoria passengers from Brindisi in southern Italy as far as Khartoum in the Sudan (via Cairo in Egypt). This was the first leg of Imperial Airways' route from Europe to South Africa. From Khartoum, Ala Littoria's passengers would transfer to its own aircraft and fly on to Kassala (Sudan), Asmara (Eritrea), Massawa (Eritrea), Djibouti (French Somaliland), Berbera (British Somaliland), Bura Galadi (British Kenya) and Mogadishu (Italian Somaliland). Full passenger service from Rome to Mogadishu opened in November 1935. By March 1937, service had been added to Gorrahei (Ethiopia) and Beledweyne (Somalia).Caprotti, \\"Fascist Civil Aviation\\", pp. 23‚Äì25. The Imperial Line was not a quick route. From Rome to Massawa took three days. Ala Littoria's chief executive, Umberto Klinger, claimed optimistically to Il Messaggero in 1936 that the route from Rome to Mogadishu took just three and a half days. Following the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, Addis Abeba was added to the route. The opening of the route from Rome to Addis Abeba via Cairo was delayed by the negotiations with the Egyptian government concerning flyover rights. The first two flights from Cairo to Addis Abeba even flew without permits.Caprotti, \\"Fascist Civil Aviation\\", pp. 27‚Äì29. By October 1937, there were four weekly flights leaving Rome for Asmara and Addis Abeba, while Asmara had two weekly to Djibouti and another two weekly to Mogadishu (both via Assab and Dire Dawa). The timetable for the Imperial Line was less precise owing the longer flight times. Departures were usually scheduled for 10:15 a.m. at Rome, but arrivals were only given as dawn, morning or afternoon. Airports and aircraft Airstrips in Italy's African colonies were mostly hot and high and the Imperial Line was more dangerous than European routes. The greater distance between airstrips in East Africa also contributed to a higher fatality rate on Imperial Line flights, with 40% of accidents resulting in deaths as opposed to 20% on European flights. Besides land-based aircraft, the Imperial Line operated seaplanes for use on coastal routes and operating out of lakes and rivers. By 1938, the trip from Rome direct to Benghazi was accomplished by a Cant Z.506 seaplane, while the leg from Benghazi to Addis Abeba by a Savoia-Marchetti S.73. Both were trimotors.Finch, World's Airways, p. 181. All the machines that flew the Imperial Line used foreign-built engines save for one S.73 that had an Alfa Pegaso and one Fokker F.VII trimotor that flew within East Africa and was equipped with an Alfa D.2. Along the Imperial Line, there were maintenance bases at Rome, Brindisi, Benghazi and Asmara.Caprotti, \\"Fascist Civil Aviation\\", p. 20. Passengers and revenues The Imperial Line's East African network had the highest revenues of any of Ala Littoria's route networks,The other networks being: Tyrrhenian, Adriatic, Littorio, Mediterranean (including the first part of the Imperial Line) and Central Europe. about 44 million lire annually in 1936‚Äì37. It had the highest passenger revenues (9 million) and the highest mail revenues (35 million), and was the only network with higher mail revenue than passenger. This despite the fact that it carried fewer passengers than the other networks, only about 5,000 annually.

Inspired by the writings of Charles Bukowski, the semi-autobiographical account of a doomed, drug and alcohol-fuelled relationship became an Australian bestseller, and is often credited with launching the short-lived Grunge Lit or Dirty realism movement ‚Äì terminology that McGahan himself (along with most of the writers to whom it was applied) rejected.  Synopsis  As the story begins, narrator Gordon Buchanan quits his job at a drive-through bottle shop in Brisbane. He and his live-in girlfriend Cynthia LaMonde, a waitress, inhabit a world of casual sex, plentiful drugs and partying till dawn, pastimes that don't really give Gordon much pleasure, plagued as he is by a sense of being unfulfilled. Love affairs gone bad and fantasies undercut by reality are the norm for a generation that stops doing something the moment it becomes work, that wants to win without competing because making an effort would render victory meaningless. The book‚Äôs hero is the chronically laidback Gordon, a chain-smoking asthmatic sweating under the Brisbane sun and scuttling his days away in a ramshackle guest house populated by itinerants and the elderly. Into Gordon‚Äôs going- nowhere-fast world comes the loud, vivacious and wholly uncompromising Cynthia, his polar opposite in almost every way. They soon move in together, and begin an often savage relationship precariously built on a shaky foundation of sex, booze, cigarettes, self-doubt and a singularly battered brand of love.  Critical reception  Praise became a cult bestseller in Australia in the years following its publication and the award of the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book. On its U. S release the influential Kirkus Review wrote: \\"Nothing life-affirming here--this prize- winning Australian first novel, straightforward and effective, immerses us in the drugs, sex, and general ennui of slackers Down Under. A bestseller in Australia, but without the superficial glamour of a Less Than Zero (to which its US publishers would like it compared). Unlikely to achieve the same success here, but, still, a bold novel, distinct voice, and impressive debut.\\"  Film adaptation  In 1998, Praise was made into a film by first time producer Martha Coleman and fellow first-timer John Curran directed. Curran cast film novices Peter Fenton (frontman of rock group Crow) and Sacha Horler (a new National Institute of Dramatic Art graduate at the time) in the highly challenging lead roles of Gordon and Cynthia. The crew was a mix of newcomers and experienced old stagers. Praise received ten AFI Award nominations.

Infancy (1821‚Äì25) Alexandre Robinet de La Serve was born in Paris on 30 March 1821. His parents were Nicole Robinet de La Serve (1791‚Äì1842) and Cl√©lie-Germinal Chevassut (1797‚Äì1825). His father was a lawyer, politician and scholar who was born and died on the √éle Bourbon (since 1848 called the √éle de la R√©union). His father moved to France after the British annexed the island in 1810, and married the daughter of Alexandre Chevassut(fr). Chevassut was a political agent and journalist who was the valet of Madame de Sta√´l and founded the journal Le Constitutionnel under the Bourbon Restoration. Chevassut employed Nicole Robinet de La Serve on the anti-royalist and Bonapartist daily Le Constitutionnel. Youth (1825‚Äì41) Nicole Robinet de La Serve's returned to Reunion with his family in 1825 when he heard his mother was dying, and became leader of the clandestine francs- cr√©oles political organization and founder of two unauthorized newspapers, le Furet and then le Salazien. Alexandre Robinet de Serve received his primary education in R√©union and completed his secondary education in Paris at the Lyc√©e Henri-IV. He began to study law, but returned to R√©union in 1840 before completing the course. He contributed to the journal L'Hebdomadaire. On 16 January 1841 La Serve married Florine de Nas de Tourris (1822‚Äì1897) in Saint- Denis, R√©union. Sugar manufacturer (1842‚Äì70) After his father died on 18 December 1842 La Serve became part owner and operator of a sugar factory at Saint-Andr√©. His establishment had a concession to use the water of the Rivi√®re du M√¢t. He welcomed the February Revolution of 1848, although the abolition of slavery threatened him with ruin. He launched the clandestine paper Le Cri Public, which on 31 July 1848 became D√©mocratie Colonial. He ran for election to the legislature in 1851 on a liberal platform, but withdrew his candidacy on 23 December 1851. La Serve was passionately opposed to the imperial government. In 1866 he was accused of having stirred up the disturbances that broke out in R√©union, but even the government representatives acknowledged that this was false. Politician (1870‚Äì82) After the fall of the Empire on 4 September 1870 the Government of National Defense issued a decree calling for the electors of France and the colonies to elect a National Assembly. Later the election was postponed, but news of the postponement had not reached the island of R√©union when they held an election on 25 November 1870. La Serve was elected Representative of R√©union by 12,804 votes out of 14,218. This vote was declared valid for the future National Assembly, where La Serve sat with the Republican Union group, Union r√©publicaine. La Serve voted with the left for the government of Adolphe Thiers, for dissolution of the assembly, against the ministry of 24 May 1873, against the seven-year term(fr), against the law on mayors, for the amendments of Henri-Alexandre Wallon and Pascal Pierre Duprat and for the constitutional laws. He was a member of the committees of deportation and on colonial banks. In 1871 Fran√ßois de Mahy and Robinet de La Serve obtained the annexation of the √éle Sainte-Marie off Madagascar to Reunion, as had been the case in the past. Robinet de La Serve published influential articles on the colonial situation in Leon Gambeta's journal la R√©publique fran√ßaise. After the assembly was dissolved La Serve was elected Senator of Reunion on 19 March 1876 by 32 out of 37 votes. He sat with the moderate left, and from 1879 with the Republican majority. He voted against dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, against the ministry of Albert de Broglie formed after the 16 May 1877 crisis and then for the ministry of Jules Armand Dufaure. La Serve died in Marseille on 4 February 1882.

The new modern firehouse, now itself occupied by Instituto de M√∫sica Juan Morel Campos, displaced the now-historic Parque de Bombas into more of a supportive and administrative firefighting role, whereas the new firehouse, located at Calle Cristina and Calle Mayor streets, became the main firehouse for the town. In 1990, after 108 years of uninterrupted service as a firehouse, the Parque de Bombas firehouse was turned into the Museo Parque de Bombas. The museum traces the people and events of the Ponce firefighters throughout its history. The museum opened under the administration of Mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago.

In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the brigade's victory over the infamous fire was commemorated at the station. Various artifacts used by the 1882 fire brigade are on display at the museum. Among these are some artifacts used to combat the 1899 \\"El Polvor√≠n\\" fire. There are also artifacts of historical significance. Even before its 1990 closure, the station had already become a major tourist attraction, and some of the firemen would give visitors free station tours voluntarily when they were not attending to emergencies. The Ponce firefighters' museum is still known generally as Parque de Bombas and, according to some estimates, it is one of Ponce's most visited tourist attractions. Exhibitions Antique fire truck at the Museum Fire fighting equipment of former fire fighters at the Museum The exhibitions in the museum are divided into three major halls. The Dispatch and Transportation Hall is located on the first floor, and the Equipment Hall and the Historical Records Hall are on the second floor. =Dispatch and transportation hall= This hall consists of a small dispatch area showing the place with the firefighter officer where emergency calls were received and relayed to the firefighting personnel (their sleeping quarters were on the upstairs floor) as well as the equipment used in fighting fires in the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Located here are some of the pumps used to hand pump the water during a fire. Also here is an old firetruck dating from the first half of the 20th century. As a museum, the old dispatch area is now used as the museum's visitors' reception area. =Firefighting equipment hall= Fire equipment at Museum This Hall is located on the southern side of the museum's second floor and, when the firehouse was operational, it was part of the firefighters' sleeping quarters. Located here are original axes, picks, bells, bugles and other such equipment as was used when the firehouse was fully operational in the nineteenth and first half to mid twentieth century. There are several firefighter uniforms, including their official Ponce Firefighters patch, as well as accompanying helmets and boots. =Historical records hall= Fire history hall at the museum This hall is located on the northern side of the museum's second floor, and it covers what was also part of the former sleeping quarters of the Ponce firefighters. In this hall the museum displays memorabilia related to the Ponce firefighters and their organizational structure. Through framed pictures, it traces the history of Ponce firefighters and some its major fires. Prominently displayed are group and individual pictures of the members of the Ponce Firefighters Corps. In addition to groups portraits of the firefighters corps visitors can see portraits of figures such as Firefighters Band director Domingo Cruz (\\"Cocol√≠a\\") and firefighters medical director physician Dr. Rafael Pujals.

Firefighter homes on Calle 25 de Enero street (May 2006) Firefighters mausoleum in Cementerio Civil de Ponce Obelisk to firefighters near the museum Another large fire included in this exhibit is the one that occurred on 25 January 1899. This was a large fire (later dubbed \\"El Polvorin\\") which threatened the lives of Ponce√±os as well as the economy of Puerto Rico as a whole, given Ponce's de facto role as Puerto Rico's banking and agricultural capital. A painting in the Museo Parque de Bombas commemorates the heroic acts of seven courageous \\"bomberos\\" and one civilian who fought bravely against the voracious fire that threatened the region. Disobeying orders from the American troops that had recently taken control of Puerto Rico, the group was able to control the flames that had started inside the U.S. Army‚Äôs gunpowder reserves. For their courage, disaster was narrowly averted.Parque de Bombas at EyeTour.com. Puerto Rico Tourism Company. Retrieved 26 April 2010. For their success battling the fire, the group was honored many times both in Ponce and the rest of Puerto Rico. A few yards from Parque de Bombas, on Plaza Federico Degetau, sits an obelisk to their memory, and at the Cementerio Civil de Ponce (Ponce Civil Cemetery) a mausoleum was erected in 1911 to their memory where all seven heroes were eventually interred.Heroism of Firefighters Still Ignites Civic Pride. Charles Hillinger. \\"Charles Hillinger's America.\\" Los Angeles Times. 22 April 1990. Retrieved 25 January 2012. Later on, the Parque de Bombas building was painted in Ponce's traditional city colors, red and black. A series of homes built a few years later for the firefighters and their families on 25 de Enero Street were also painted in these colors also. A sad event in the history of this museum is the disappearance of an important historical document during 1975 restoration of Parque de Bombas. The document was the original (and so far only known copy) of the Proclamation of the \\"Heroes de El Polvorin\\" made by the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly in 1906. In the Proclamation, seven firefighters and one civilian were declared heroes by Puerto Rico's highest national legislative body.Album Hist√≥rico de Ponce Ruth Fortu√±o Sell√©s.

An early version of it was first posted on Pixiv on August 16, 2011. The web manga began its serialization in Magazine Pocket, an online and app based web manga magazine published by Kodansha, on November 1, 2017. An anime television series adaptation by Telecom Animation Film has been announced. Plot When an introverted male student meets a girl called Nagatoro, his life is turned upside down. She first quietly observes his reaction to verbal abuse from some other high-school girls that are not well-meaning, realizes that oddly enough in his case it may be exactly what he needs, and so begins a sequence of her teasing him. It soon becomes increasingly obvious (to the reader, not to him) that her teasing is actually sardonic, well-intentioned, and flirtatious, but he eventually starts to catch on. Characters ; : :Nagatoro is a 16-year-old girl who likes to mess with Senpai and finds joy in teasing him. Although it appears that she just wants to torture him, it is progressively confirmed that she actually has a crush on him. Whenever anyone else tries to bully her Senpai, she becomes very hostile towards them. Her friends call her and seem to sometimes be an annoyance to her. ; :Senpai is the protagonist of the series. He is a timid introvert, who tries to avoid social interaction with other people and likes to draw. After meeting Nagatoro and starting to hang out with her and her friends, he became progressively more self-confident. It is currently unknown if Senpai has any friends, outside of Nagatoro and her friend group. Nagatoro only calls him Senpai, however in the original webcomic, his name was . ; :Gamo-chan is a member of Nagatoro's group of friends. She's the most mature among her peers and, despite her tough appearance often act as a \\"big sister\\" toward them. She and Nagatoro seems to have some kind of friendly rivalry. As the first person who realized about Nagatoro's feelings for Senpai, she enjoys tease them both. She likes to call Senpai and albeit very critic toward him, they got friendlier as the story progress. ; :Yoshi is another member of Nagatoro's group of friends. She typically follows Gamo-chan around and goes along with whatever schemes she has in mind. It's also made clear by others that she isn't particularly bright, but her high energy and follower mentality make her a recurring character next to Gamo-chan. Most of her speech is her repeating what somebody else already said. ; :Sakura is the least seen member of Nagatoro's friend group in the manga, not being seen for twenty-five chapters until finally returning inexplicably. She has darker skin, like Nagatoro, with blonde hair. Her personality on the surface is sweet and quite relaxed, but underneath her friends know her for sewing seeds of jealousy in groups of boys that compete for her attention. She often speaks about stringing along several guys at once for amusement, but she never actually goes beyond flirting with them. ; :The art club president. She has long hair that frames her face with dark-brown eyes. Her personality is stern and serious but she also tends to be quite shameless. Despite her rigidity she treats Senpai with respect, unlike Nagatoro. She also bears a resemblance to a female character in one of Senpai's manga. The first two kanjis of her last name were shown to be ; :Nagatoro's older sister, she's an university student who greatly cares for and loves to spoil her little sister but also likes to tease her, and often embarrasses her.

Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 694 (\\"Titus Salienus\\", \\"Salienus Clemens\\"). Origin The nomen Salienus belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix -enus, typically from other gentile names, or occasionally from places. The root of the name is not apparent, but it could be an orthographic variation of Salvienus, from the Oscan praenomen Salvius. Most of the Salieni known from inscriptions seem to have come from Umbria, Sabinum, Samnium, or Campania, suggesting that they were indeed of Oscan or Umbrian descent.Chase, p. 118. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Salieni were Titus and Quintus. Several other names received occasional use, including Aulus, Lucius, and Publius. All were among the most common names throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina The Salieni used a variety of cognomina, most of which appear to have been personal surnames. The majority belong to common types of cognomen, derived from an individual's personal characteristics.

In Sandy, Smith established the Sandy Blacksmith and Horseshoeing Shop, which he operated with his brother, Melvin. The R. S. Smith Motor Building was constructed after Smith shifted from blacksmithing and entered the automobile sales business, opening a Ford Motor Company agency in 1912. The building was fashioned as an auto sales showroom and garage with a combined service station. Designed in the Mission Revival architectural style, the building, constructed in 1930, is primarily made of concrete. At the time of the building's construction, Smith was the mayor of Sandy.

The game was originally released in November, 1997 and ended up on Macintosh and Windows. In the Anglosphere, it was published by Tivola, who had recently published other edutainment titles such as Physicus, Bioscopia, and Chemicus. Originally in Dutch, the game was later translated into English, German, Japanese, French and Italian. The game was voiced by Joost Prinsen and won a BAFTA Award in 1999 after its English-language release. Production The game was created by Jan Willem Huisman, Hayo Wagenaar, and Sander Hassing. The three developers at IJsfontein knew each other from the InterAction Design department of the Utrecht School of the Arts, where they designed the concept of the game. Hajo Wagenaar made all the drawings, Sander Hassing served as programmer, Jan Willem Huisman organised the operation. The came up with the name \\"IJsfontein\\" during the development of this game, which was their first project; while other development companies had English names they wanted to choose something Dutch- sounding.http://www.publicspacemedia.nl/downloads/158_159_inAM2_NAMENLR.pdf The game's sound designer came up with \\"Ice fountain\\" because ice is static while a fountain is dynamic. While getting into large debt, the team was invited to the Cannes expo named Milia, where they set up a stall in a section for young talent. Interest from a Japanese publisher put them in a strong negotiating position with VNU Interactive; while it was standard for the publisher to get rights to the game, the develoeprs refused. They felt the publisher was condescending from their comments that the world does not work the way they think it does. Upon signing a contract with the Chinese, they discovered VNU still expected the company to lose the copyright due to not meeting a deadline. The team entered into a 'double or nothing' negotiation, whereby failing to complete the titled by 6 October, it would result in heavy royalty regulations. The team ultimately presented a beta version to children at an Amsterdam primary school, after suffering through a panic-stricken September. The game was playtested by children from the top three groups of primary school; the developers noted the potential for the game to be popular with girls due to them finding solutions in a process-wise way, as opposed to boys who will click the screen 10,000 times until something happens. By 2016, 40 people would work at IJsfontein. =Design= It was one of the first serious games ever to be developed. At the time, IJsfontein was the first Dutch studio to explicitly develop a game with an educational bend.http://creativeindustries.com.cuhk.edu.hk/wp- content/uploads/2014/12/European-Game-Industry-Report-2013.pdf The game attempts to bridge two opposing sides of the video gaming market by offering an experience that is both fun and educational.  Plot and gameplay  In the Castle of Infinity, there are five masters that bring balance to the elements. When Master of Chance loses his cat, the balance of the elements is disturbed. It is up to the player to collect pages of the Garden of Chance story, which will then cause Master of Chance to reveal clues about the whereabouts of his cat. The game is puzzle based, with themes ranging from the natural world to physics to science.  Critical reception  Gameboomers felt the puzzles required more dexterity than thought. Feibel felt the game was difficult and beautifully illustrated. The essay Op de koffie bij de Meester van Wanhoop thought the game demonstrated the wondrous potential of merging art and play in the digital world. The game won a BAFTA award and a La Fletche d'Or. The game was nominated for the Bafta for most instructive game for children, and for the most interactive game for children. The game was featured at the IFFR. The game was also a commercial success, and become one of the best-selling pieces of Dutch CD-ROM software.

The film stars Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Joely Richardson and Vanessa Redgrave; Academy Award-winner James Ivory acting as executive producer.  Plot  Set in Venice in the late 19th century and based on Henry James' novella of the same name,The Aspern Papers is a story of obsession, grandeur lost, and dreams of Byronesque adventures. Ambitious editor Morton Vint is fascinated by the Romantic poet Jeffrey Aspern and by his icon's short and wildly romantic life. Having travelled from America to Venice, he is determined to get his hands on the letters Aspern wrote to his beautiful lover and muse, Juliana Bordereau. Now the ferocious guardian of their secrets, Juliana lives in a grand but rather dilapidated Venetian palazzo with her niece, Miss Tina. Posing as prospective lodger, Morton charms Miss Tina, who leads a very quiet life dominated by her aunt. At first hiding his real intentions, he eventually confesses his true passion to Miss Tina. She reluctantly agrees to help him. But Juliana is suspicious of Morton, and a confrontation between the two of them shows how frail the strong-willed old lady actually is. Morton flees the house. When he returns, he learns of Juliana's death. Miss Tina is now willing to share the infamous letters with him, but the condition she sets is one that Morton finds he cannot fulfill, after all. Deeply ashamed by the rejection, Tina overcomes her embarrassment and hurt and finds an unknown inner strength. When Morton reconsiders his decision, she confronts him with a revelation.

Reception The film holds a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from a total of 20 reviews, indicating strong dislike. Several critics lamented the film's sluggishness; John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"more lifeless than its namesake's long-dead body,\\" while David Lewis of the San Francisco Chronicle labeled it \\"a Merchant-Ivory film - on Quaaludes,\\" giving it 1 out of 4 stars. Many critics considered the performance from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers to be one of the picture's worst aspects; writing for Slant Magazine, Keith Watson said: > \\"Rhys-Meyers is absurdly unconvincing throughout. With his gratingly thin > American accent, stilted line readings, and rigid, glowering facial > expressions, the actor demonstrates all the range and emotional depth of > Derek Zoolander.

Published on October 1, 2005 by Tor Books, it is the author's second novel. The book received the Alex Award in 2006 and was nominated for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award in 2007.  Plot  The Necessary Beggar tells the story of alleged murderer Darroti and his family after he is exiled from the city of L√©mabantunk in Gandiffri, a paradisaical land built on the central idea of community. Murder is the sole unforgivable crime in this world, and as Darroti is accused of murdering a mendicant (a holy beggar), his crimes are considered particularly egregious. Darroti's family follows him through the glowing doorway that leads to the randomly selected realm of his exile. They emerge at the entrance of an American refugee camp. Unable to speak the language or explain their origins, the family is prohibited from being officially admitted into the country but impossible to deport. The situation is made worse by the heightened xenophobia present in this year 2022 version of America. Faced with the guilt of his family‚Äôs exile, Darroti commits suicide to relieve his loved ones of his burden. Rather than be reincarnated in a new form as he would have been in his homeland, he becomes a ghost. To his dismay, his death throws his father into depression and embitters his other family members. He attempts to provide explanation by entering his father‚Äôs dreams, but his communications are interpreted as nightmares. Lisa and Stan, camp volunteers and evangelists, help the family adapt to the new culture. Zamatryna, one of Darroti‚Äôs nieces, is the quickest to adapt thanks to her high intelligence. When a bomb planted by an anti-immigration group explodes in the camp, Lisa helps the family escape under the guise of death. She allows them to live in the home inherited from her mother with the loose promise of payback at a later date. Zamatryna continues to flourish in school, convinced that education is the only way to make her family‚Äôs life easier, while the adults acquire work. She meets a boy named Jerry who slowly convinces her to consider her own desires and open up to those who wish to know her. The final push is made by Darroti when he manipulates the dreams of the more susceptible Jerry. Through Jerry, the family discovers that Darroti didn't murder the mendicant; she was in fact his lover, and under the impression that Darroti had been unfaithful, killed herself. With the truth now known, Darroti‚Äôs spirit is returned to L√©mabantunk. Zama and Jerry marry so that she may gain citizenship and sponsor her family.  Characters  * Darroti - Timbor's youngest child. Restless and impulsive, he was never quite as comfortable with life in L√©mabantunk as the other members of the family. His displeasure with his place in life was expressed by excessive spending and alcoholism. It is when he locks himself in a friend's apartment to detox for his lover that she misinterprets his act of love as infidelity. * Zamatryna - Eroloit and Harani's daughter. She arrives in the United States as a child and is unable to recall much of L√©mabantunk. In addition to being highly intelligent, she assimilates to the new culture with the most ease. This results in the burden of the family's future being placed on her shoulders. Zama also carries a beetle into the U.S. which continually traces an X, the symbol of silence in L√©mabantunk, which causes her to hide its existence. This beetle is the \\"murdered\\" mendicant in her reincarnated form. * Timbor - the family's patriarch and the father of Eroloit, Darroti, and Macsofo. Their mother, Frella, died before the events of the story took place. In his move from L√©mabantunk to America, TImbor transitions from carpet merchant to taxi driver. He is the only character to form a bond with Stan. * Macsofo - the family member who harbors the most resentment towards Darroti and the situation that his alleged crime has put them in. He becomes short-tempered and verbally abusive to the point that his wife leaves the family home and takes the children with her. * Gallicina - the mendicant Darroti is accused of murdering. It is unusual that she decides to become a mendicant, because it's normally a rite of passage reserved for men. In addition to being part of a protected class as a mendicant, she comes from a prestigious family which makes for a large class discrepancy between her and Darroti. * Lisa's - Stan's wife. Her main occupation is helping Stan to grow the congregation of the small church that he operates from home. She is respectful of the family's culture and makes no overt attempts at converting them to Christianity. She served time in prison long ago. * Stan - the pastor of a small, struggling church. He makes a concentrated effort to convert the family and considers the expression of their religion to be blasphemous. His portrayal of Christianity frightens the family making his efforts unsuccessful.

Trade, plundering raids and travel brought the Norsemen into close contacts with Christian communities, but their conversion only started after powerful chieftains decided to receive baptism during their stay in England or Normandy. Haakon the Good was the first king to make efforts to convert the whole country, but the rebellious pagan chieftains forced him to apostatize. Olaf Tryggvason started the destruction of pagan cult sites in the late 10th century, but only Olaf Haraldsson achieved the official adaption of Christianity in the 1020s. Missionary bishops subjected to the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were responsible for the spread of the new faith before the earliest bishoprics were established around 1100. Pagan beliefs A gullgubber depicting a ghost Manuscripts written in the 13th century preserved most information about the Norsemen's pre-Christian religious beliefs. The Poetic Edda contain Old Norse poems about the creation and the end of the world. Snorri Sturluson incorporated several myths of Odin, Thor, T√Ωr and other pagan gods in his Prose Edda. Odin was the most important god of the pantheon, but he was never regarded omnipotent. The gods were thought to live in farms together with their sposes and children, just like their mortal worshippers. The Eddas also mentioned the j√∂tnar (or giants), describing them as the gods' superhuman enemies. Old Norse religious practises are poorly documented. The chieftains were allegedly the religious leaders of their communities, because the existence of a separate cast of priests cannot be detected. Most cult sites, known as hofs, were large halls built on the chieftains' farms. Gullgubbersmall gold objects decorated with pagan motifsplaced near poles in early medieval buildings in M√¶re, Klepp and other places are most frequently interpreted as a sign of a pagan cult center by archaeologists. Christian laws also mentioned outdoor cult sites which were known as horgs. Bans on eating horsemeat after the official conversion to Christianity imply that it was an important element of pagan cults. Norsemen buried their dead in the ground or cremated them, but they always placed burial gifts in the graves. The wealth and social status of the deceased influenced the size of their graves and the amount of grave goods. The highest-ranking chiefs and their relatives were buried under large burial mounds, but the poorest commoners' graves were almost invisible. The shamanistic belief system of the nomadic Saami (or Lapps), who lived in the northern regions, was different from the Old Norse religion. The Saami mainly worshipped benevolent goddesses and buried their dead under piles of stones. They were famed for their healing abilities for centuries, but their Christian neighbors often regarded them as wizards and sorcerers. Middle Ages =Towards conversion= Norsemen were brought into close contact with Christian communities in the Viking Age. Reliquary, cross pendants and other objects of Christian provenance easily reached Norway through trade, plundering raids or travel from around 800. Contemporaneous authors wrote of pagan Vikings who wore the sign of cross to mingle freely with the local crowd during their raids. Contemporaneous authors wrote of pagan Vikings who wore the sign of cross to mingle freely with the local crowd during their raids. Christian objects were placed in the graves, especially in the graves of wealthy women, but their pagan context suggests that they rarely expressed the dead's adherence to Christianity. A mould for a cross found at Kaupangan important center of commerce in the 9th and 10th centuriesbears testimony to the local production of crosses, but it does not prove the existence of a local Christian community, because foreigners could also be the buyers of such products. The 13th-century Heimskringla attributes the conversion of Norway to four kingsHaakon the Good, Harald Greycloak, Olaf Tryggvason and Olaf Haraldssonwho were baptised abroad in the 10th and 11th centuries. Earlier Christian missionaries are not mentioned in the primary sources. The similar storylines of the four kings' biographies imply that their authors followed a common pattern, but most modern historians accept them as reliable sources. The most ambitious chieftains could strengthen their personal links to foreign rulers through baptism. Fights for the expansion of the new faith enabled the missionary kings to get rid of their enemies, replacing them with their own partisans. The introduction of a professional cast of Christian priests abolished the religious leadership of the kings' heathen rivals. The Christians' belief in one omnipotent God strengthened the ideological basis for a centralized monarchy. Most commoners converted to Christianity either to demonstrate their loyalty to the Christian monarchs or to secure their support. Haakon the Good was the son of Harald Fairhair whom the sagas credited with the unification of Norway. Harald sent Haakon to England to be brought up in King √Üthelstan's court, most probably in token of an alliance between the two kings. Haakon was baptised and Benedictine monks accompanied him back to his homeland around 934 to spread Christian ideas in his kingdom. Sturluson claimed that Haakon also invited a bishop from England. The bishop may have been identical with a monk from the Anglo-Saxon Glastonbury Abbey who was known as Sigefridus Norwegensis episcopus (\\"Sigefrid, bishop of the Norwegians\\"). The pagan chieftains of M√∏re and Tr√∏ndelag rebelled against Haakon, destroyed the churches that he had built and murdered the Christian missionaries. They also forced the king to apostatize. Archaeologists tentatively date a 10th-century churchyard at Ve√∏y to Haakon's time. Harald Greycloak, who succeeded Haakon in 961, had been baptised in Northumbria. He also tried to spread Christianity in Norway, but he was forced into exile. The region of Oslo was directly subjected to the rule of Harald Bluetooth, King of Denmark, who had already converted to Christianity. He sent two earls to the territory to force the local inhabitants to adopt Christianity. Some of the 62 Christian graves excavated at St. Clement's Church in Oslo can be dated to Harald Bluetooth's rule. Olaf Tryggvason was a Viking warlord who had made plundering raids against the coasts of the Baltic Sea and England before being baptized in the early 990s. The tribute that he collected in England enabled him to return to Norway in 995. Adam of Bremen wrote that Tryggvason had been the \\"first to bring Christianity to Norway\\"; the monk Oddr Snorrason attributed the conversion of five countriesIceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Orkney, the Hebrides and Shetlandto Tryggvason's missionary campaigns. A saga described him as a \\"horg breaker\\", referring to the destruction of pagan cult sites during his reign. =Christianization= St Olaf Olaf Haraldsson completed the missionary work that his three Christian predecessors had commenced. He was baptized in Rouen in Normandy before he invaded Norway in 1015. Anglo-Saxon clergymen accompanied him to the kingdom, according to the sagas. Anglo-Saxon influence both on the Christian vocabulary of the Norwegian language and on the earliest Christian laws is well- documented. Adam of Bremen claimed that Olaf had also urged the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen to send German missionaries to Norway. Olaf convoked a thing (or general assembly) to Moster where the official conversion of Norway to Christianity was decided in 1022. The king and Bishop Grimketel introduced the earliest Christian laws at the same assembly. Historians have traditionally interpreted the runic inscription on the Kuli stone as a reference to the thing, but both the dating of the stone and the reading of the fragment ris..umr on it as kristintumr (\\"Christendom\\") are problematic. Cnut the Great, King of England and Denmark, and the Norwegian chieftains who supported him expelled Olaf from the country in 1028 or 1029. According to Adam of Bremen, the chieftains rose up against Olaf because he had ordered their wives' execution for witchcraft, but Olaf's most enemies were actually Christians. Cnut is credited with the establishment of a Benedictine monastery in Trondheim by an Anglo-Saxon source, but modern historians do not regard it a reliable source. Olaf returned to Norway and died fighting against his enemies in the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Sagas written in the early 1030s testify that Olaf was venerated as a holy king soon after his death. Court poets rarely referred to pagan myths in their poems written after Olaf's reign, which is a clear sign of the spread of Christian ideas. Archeologically, the process of Christianization cannot be exactly documented, especially because Christian burials cannot be certainly identified and dated. Pagan burials allegedly disappeared between 950 and 1050 in most regions, but the Saami insisted on their traditional faith for centuries. Both written sources and archaeological finds evidence that the new faith spread from the coastlines to the inland regions. The earliest Christian churches were most frequently built on previous heathen cemeteries, but the coexistence of Christian and pagan communities in the same settlements cannot be proved. =Development of Church organization= The conversion to Christianity brought about the establishment of a hierarchically organized Church in Norway. Only professional clerics could celebrate the Mass which was the central ceremony of Christianity. The clerics also surveyed their parishioners' way of life, because medieval Christians were required to respects a series of rules governing their everyday life. They could not work on ecclesiastical holiday and they had to fast on each Friday. Urnes Stave Church, built in the mid-12th century The archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were responsible for the missions in Scandinavia. Olaf Haraldsson's half-brother, Harald Hardrada, who was king of Norway from 1046 to 1066, preferred bishops ordained in England or France, but Pope Leo IX confirmed the jurisdiction of the German archbishops in Norway in 1053. Missionary bishops were the first prelates in Norway, but they had no established sees. Adam of Bremen recorded that the Norwegian dioceses had still no defined boundaries in 1076. The fylki (or counties), which were important elements of secular administration, became also the basic units of ecclesiastic organization, most probably already during the reign of Olaf Haraldsson. One church was recognized in each fylki as the district's principal church. The fylki were divided into fourths or eighths and a church of minor rank was established in each subdivision. Wealthy people were allowed to build private churches, known as convenience churches. The earliest churches were built by the monarchs or noblemen and the builders' successors insisted on the appointment of the local priests. Porches of the oldest stave churches were often decorated with scenes from pagan myths. Most stone churches were built on the site of previous stave churches. Anglo-Norman, German and Danish architecture influenced the design of the oldest churches, but a locally inspired style developed in Trondheim in the 11th century. The first permanent bishopricsBergen, Nidaros and Osloseems to have been founded during the reign of Harald Hardrada's successor, Olaf Kyrre, who died in 1093. They were first listed in a document about the Scandinavian civitates (or bishoprics) shortly after 1100. The document is most probably connected to the establishment of the Archbishopric of Lund in Denmark in 1104 by Pope Paschal II, which abolished the jurisdiction of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen in Scandinavia. The large diocese of Bergen was divided into two when a new bishopric was set up at Stavanger around 1125. A fifth diocese was established at Hamar through the division of the bishopric of Oslo in 1153 or 1154. Sigurd the Crusader ordered the collection of the tithe in 1096 or 1097. The new tax which was regularly collected only from the middle of the 12th century enabled the organization of the first parishes. Sigurd launched a crusade to the Holy Land in 1108. He was the first king to strive for the establishment of an independent Norwegian archbishopric, but only the growing influence of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in Denmark convinced the pope to support the idea. In March 1152, Cardinal Nicholas Breakspear was appointed papal legate to Norway and Sweden and was tasked with the establishment of new archbishoprics. Breakspear made Jon Birgersson the first archbishop of Nidaros in early 1153. The archbishopric included all Norwegian dioceses and also six bishoprics in the oversea territories. Breakspear also introduced the collection of the Peter's pence (an ecclesiastic tax payable to the Holy See) and organized the first cathedral chapters. Most cathedral chapters consisted of 12 secular canons, each having their own prebend (or regular income). The first Benedictine monasteries were established around 1100. Nidarholm Abbey was founded at Trondheim by a wealthy nobleman. Munkeliv Abbey and Selje Abbey were established in the early 12th century. The first Cistercian monks came from English abbeys in the 1140s. Their earliest abbey was founded at Lyse near Bergen by the local bishop. The first Augustinian community settled in Norway around 1150. Premonstratensians also came to Norway in the middle of the 12th century, but they were not as popular as the Cistercians and Augustinians. The monarchs' correspondence with the popes show that they regarded themselves the actual rulers of the Norwegian church in the second half of the 11th century. The establishment of the archbishopric at Nidaros strengthened the authority of the Holy See, especially because prelates who had been staunch supporters of the ideas of Gregorian Reform were made archbishops. John Birgersson's successor, Eysteinn Erlendsson, crowned the minor Magnus Erlingsson king in 1163 or 1164. Both the Law of Succession, which was issued before the ceremony, and the king's coronation oath emphasized that the monarchs should rule justly and seek advice from the prelates. Archbishop Eysteinn also persuaded the king to confirm the privileges of the clergy around 1170. The Gregorian ideas were actually not fully adopted. Clerical celibacy, for instance, was not still a rule. The Canones Nidrosiensesa collection of local canonsintroduced a ban on marriage between a priest and a widow or a divorced woman, but otherwise ordinary priests were allowed to contract formal marriages. Pope Gregory IX forbade the Norwegian priests to marry in 1237, but most of them continued to live with women and father children. Concubinage could never be suppressed and priests' children were more easily acknowledged as legitimate heirs than in other parts of Catholic Europe. Sverre Sigurdsson who defeated and killed Magnus Erlingsson in 1184 refused to confirm the privileges of the Church. He insisted on his right to appoint his candidates to the most important churches and to interfere in the election of bishops. Archbishop Eysteinn and his successor, Eirik Ivarsson, were forced into exile. Sverre crowned himself king in 1194 and refused to accept Pope Innocent III's judgement in favor of the exiled archbishop. After all Norwegian bishops fled to Denmark to join their archbishop, the pope excommunicated the king. The king's views were summarized in the Speech against the Bishops, which emphasized the monarchs' direct link to God. Sverre's son, Haakon III, was reconciled with the Holy See. The bishops' right to appoint the parish priests was confirmed, but the church builders' successors preserved the right to present their candidates to the bishops. The expansion of the Nidaros Cathedral in Gothic style started in the 1180s and was completed in the 1210s. The cathedral became the center of the cult of St Olaf. The mendicant orders settled in Scandinavia in the 1220s. The Dominicans were the first to come, and the Franciscans soon followed them. Haakon Haakonson, who mounted the throne in 1217, was the first king to make serious efforts to convert the Saami. A Saami mystic convinced Margaret I to support new missions among the Saami in the 1380s, but the vast majority of the Saami remained pagans.

It comprises women's fiction, poetry, and short stories and has a long tradition in Malayalam literature. The pennezhuthu category is its most decisive and controversial form, changing the historiography of women's writing in India and the images of certain writers and writing trends. Malayalam literature's most significant female authors are K. Saraswathi Amma, Rajalakshmi, Lalithambika Antharjanam and Madhavikutty (Kamala Das), best known for their narrating of \\"woman's space\\". Women's literary writing in Malayala is part of a tradition of resistance and contributes to the women's cause through the merging of the public and the private spheres. Women's writing emerged in India as a new subject of research and critical studies in the 1980s as a result of the feminist movement and as a consequence of growing interest in feminist historiography. As a discursive practice, women's writing is among the wider cultural context of patriarchy and its structural manifestations. Despite the varying specificity of content under different modes of production, patriarchy can be described in terms of the dominance of the male and a corresponding marginalization of women. Women's writing is important as a response to patriarchal relations within patriarchy itself. It may provide a unique record of the systems which shape and contain the life stories of women. Women can identify women's writing as a struggle \\"which involves both dominant perceptions of social reality and the resistances to it\\". In this sense, women's writings are significant documents in the analysis of women's spaces, which demonstrate the making and remaking of these spaces while recording their resistances to the outside world. Feminist historiography, while deconstructing dominant ways of writing women's history, considers women's writing itself to be history writing. Two terms are used in relation to the subject: women-writing and women's writing. Women's writing refers simply to writings by women. Women-writing usually denotes the phenomenon of women's writing and its emergence as a new discipline within women's studies. Women from most of the dominant communities, who had access to education, started writing by the second half of the 19th century. They wrote in journals and magazines in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Susie Tharu and Lalitha identify the period as \\"a high point of women's journalism and in almost every region, women edited journals for women and many hundreds of women wrote in them.\\" There were several magazines including Keraliya Suguna Bodhini (1886), Sarada (1904), Lakshmibai (1905), Mahilaratnam (1916), Mahila (1921), Sahodari (1925), Mahilamandiram (1927), Malayalam Anika (1931), and Street (1933) during this period, and journals for women from various communities. Most of the journals carried articles written by women on issues such as health, education, child rearing, family, etc. All these writings, which basically followed the writings of some male reformers, reflected the attempt to create a model Malayali woman by mixing tradition and modernity in appropriate quantities. These attempts could be viewed as early attempts at bringing \\"private\\" issues into \\"public\\" notice. But the image that was being constructed across communities and identities consisted largely of an ideal middle class woman who was educated, homely and suitable for a modern educated man. Jancy James notes that the shift from verse to prose in women's expression is related to women's education. Women writers such as Lalithambika Antharjanam (1909‚àí1985) and K. Saraswathi Amma (1919‚àí1975) used prose efficiently and frequently, although there were writers such as Mary John Thottam or Sister Mary Benigna (1901‚àí1985), Koothattukulam Mary John (1905‚àí?), Kadathanattu Madhavi Amma (1909‚àí1999), and Balamani Amma (1909‚àí2004) who wrote in verse. For most of these women writers, education functioned more as an indirect means of access to the public sphere than as a means merely to read and write. Unlike earlier women-writers who wrote in Sanskrit, women who had access to modern education expressed their own experiences in their own languages.

These have included philosophers such as Giorgio Agemben and Jacques Ranci√®re, film scholars such as Jacques Aumont, filmmakers such as Jo√£o C√©sar Monteiro, and critics such as Kent Jones and Jonathan Rosenbaum.

These \\"great names\\" include Serge Daney, who founded Trafic. Garin Dowd, Professor of Critical Theory and Film at the London College of Music and Media, describes Daney as \\"widely recognized in his homeland as the most important French film critic after Andr√© Bazin.\\" The journal Trafic, subsequent to Daney's \\"death from AIDS in 1992, has continued his legacy,\\" its first issue appearing in Winter 1991 (available January 1992).

Plot In Hong Kong, a vigilante known as the Masked Prosecutor have been punishing criminals who were sentenced not guilty by the court, which include a 15-year-old teenager (Lam Tsz-sin) who pushed a couple down the hill in a robbery but was proven to be psychopathic, Ng Mang (Frankie Ng), a triad leader involved in a gang negotiation in Temple Street which caused one killed and three injured but was released due to lack of evidence, and Leung Siu- chueng (Wayne Lai), director of Yun Man Industry Limited who was acquitted from a rape charge because the jury believed the accuser was having too much sex fantasies. The Masked Prosecutor's punishment involves forcing his detainees to listen to Hindu Buddhist chanting music, whipping them with a cane and tattooing a number on their arm for them to remember their chronological order of his being his detainee before tossing them outside the police station. Officer Wah Kai-lun (Jordan Chan) was assigned to work on the case of the Masked Prosecutor with veteran officer Wan Ping-kai (Blackie Ko), known as Guy, who is six months away from retirement. Wah and Guy proceed to interrogate the three detainees in the hospital. Afterwards, Wah visits Guy's house and notices the lack of photographs present there. Guy's daughter, Siu- yu (Grace Yip) shows Wah a photo album with pictures of her family along with a picture of Guy with his godsons, Tong Hiu-tai (Louis Koo) and Wan Chi-nin (Michael Tse), who were also police officers and the trio were known as the Three Eagles of Mongkok. Wah takes the picture of the trio with him and tries to find clues while listening to the interrogations by the three detainees. At this time, it is also reported that Kwong Cho-foon (Lo Mang), who was involved in a gold shop robbery two years ago where he also killed a man and crippling his daughter, have been acquitted of all charges. Wah plans to use Kwong to lure out the Masked Prosecutor. On the night of the operation, the Masked Prosecutor appears, attacking and attempts to abduct Kwong in a massage parlour before being interfered by Wah. The Masked Prosecutor gets into a scuffle with Wah where gains the upper and was about to shoot Wah before leaving the scene as uniformed officers arrive. Guy, who was slacking in a Cha chaan teng, also arrives and gets into an argument with Wah when the latter reveals that he suspect Guy is acquainted with the Masked Prosecutor, who Wah suspects to be Guy's godson, Hiu-tai. Hiu-tai, who was once a police officer, was charged for manslaughter after killing a robber who surrendered. Because of this, Wah suspects Hiu-tai, but Guy refuses to believe Hiu-tai to be the Masked Prosecutor. Guy, who was present when Tong killed the robber, reveals the story: three years ago, Guy became sworn brothers and a godfather to Hiu- tai and Chi-nin. During that occasion, the trio were called upon for an operation to arrest drug dealers. A gunfight and chase ensues and two of the suspects were apprehended. While chasing down the final criminal, Hiu-tai mistakenly shoots and kills Chi-nin, which Guy was unaware of. Devastated, Hiu-tai kills the final suspect even the latter has surrendered. Guy has planned to quit the force if Hiu-tai loses his job, but refrains after realizing he would be missing out HK$1 million of pension after he retire. Therefore, Guy believes Hiu-tai resents him. To continue on the investigation, Guy and Wah visit the Solvia-Pokka-Fuji Family Rehab Center, where Hiu-tai used to hang out with his girlfriend Ada (Jessica Hsuan), who was Chi-nin's older sister. There, they see Hiu-tai helping out an old lady before walking into a cha chaan teng. There, Wah straight up asks Hiu-tai whether he is the Masked Prosecutor, bu the latter walks away without saying a word. In the middle of night, Hiu-tai gives a call to Wah and tells him he plans to kill Kwong because of Wah's interference. Wah sends his subordinate to protect Kwong and stations him in a hotel room. Hiu-tai, disguised as a Buddhist monk, sneaks into the hotel and takes down Wah's subordinates before entering into Kwong's hotel room and killing him. Wah proceeds to chase Hiu-tai outside the streets and when he finally caught up, he points his gun at Hiu-tai. Hiu-tai ignores him and Wah fires a shot. As Wah walks over to cuff Hiu-tai, Guy appears and knocks Wah unconscious and drives Hiu-tai away from the scene. Guy urges Hiu-tai to stop what he is doing because it is illegal, but Hiu-tai refuses, stating he rather die than go to jail as he was tortured by criminals he helped incarcerate when he was in prison. Hiu-tai believes he is doing the right thing because the world is unfair that criminals can get away from the justice as long as they can afford to pay good lawyers. Hiu-tai also promises to leave Hong Kong and will only return after Guy retires. The next day, Guy was arrested by the Internal Affairs for assaulting Wah and helping Hiu-tai escape. When Hiu-tai was about to leave Hong Kong, he hears about Guy's arrest on the news, he gives a call to Wah, accusing Wah of pushing a cop to hell since Guy would either be killed or commit suicide if he will be imprisoned. Hiu-tai also threatens to kill Wah if Guy goes to jail. As Guy is being escorted to prison, Guy kills several police officers and attempts to free Guy. Also, it turns out to a scheme set up by Wah. As Hiu-fai flees, Wah gives chase, from a foot chase leading to a car chase until Hiu-fai's car explodes after running into another car. Hiu-tai narrowly escapes the explosion and gets into a brief scuffle with Wah and manages to snatch the latter's pistol. The police arrives and Hiu-tai hold Wah hostage. Eventually, Hiu-tai empties the pistol and pushes Wah away, pretending to fire at the cops. In the end, Hiu-tai'a ashes were taken by Guy and placed them next to Chi-nin's at the temple, where Guy, Wah and Siu-yu pay their respects. It is also revealed that Wah changed his testimony so Guy would not end up in prison. There, they encounter Ada, who has become a nun.

It was an international co-production filmed on-location in locations across Europe, including Denmark, Belgium, Spain, and Italy. It tells the story of a Danish police officer (Coster-Waldau) who is seeking justice for the murder of his partner by a vengeful man (Ebouaney), hampered by the fact that his target is a CIA informant. In the United States, it was released direct-to-VOD on May 31, 2019, by Saban Films, but received theatrical releases in other territories. It received generally negative reviews. De Palma has expressed discontentment with the final film, revealing in interviews that due to production issues considerable sections of the original script were never filmed as intended. Plot Copenhagen police officers Christian Toft and Lars Hansen are sent to check out a reported domestic disturbance in an apartment. When they arrive, they find a man trying to leave the building with blood on his shoes. Toft assumes he‚Äôs the domestic assailant and handcuffs him. Hansen send him upstairs to go check on the man‚Äôs wife, when Toft realizes he accidentally left his gun at home. He takes Hansen‚Äôs and goes upstairs, only to find the apartment filled with firearms, plastic explosives, and a man lying dead with his throat slit and fingers removed. Using a hidden knife, the assailant breaks free from his restraints and attacks Hansen, inadvertently cutting his throat. The wounded Hansen tells Toft to give chase before losing consciousness. Toft pursues the assailant across the rooftop, but both fall several stories. While Toft lies incapacitated, he sees three men come up and knock the assailant out before taking him away. The police identify the assailant from fingerprints as Ezra Tarzi, a Libyan emigrant and former Special Forces operative whose parents had been killed by Salah Al-Din, an ISIS commander known as ‚ÄúSheikh‚Äù. Al-Din, who smuggles weapons and explosives through a tomato importer based in Brussels, is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks which he films and edits before posting them online. Tarzi‚Äôs victim, Farooq Hares, was one of Al-Din‚Äôs lieutenants, and Tarzi was trying to get to him. Toft wants to pursue Tarzi to bring him to justice, but is suspended by his superior Detective Wold after he learns that Toft misplaced his service weapon, and is interrogated by internal affairs inspector Alex Boe. Meanwhile, Tarzi and his family have been abducted by CIA agent Joe Martin, who has relentlessly pursued Al-Din ever since he killed five of his colleagues years earlier. Martin pressures a reluctant Tarzi into working on his behalf by threatening to reveal his murderous deeds to his children. He sends him first after Hares‚Äô nephew in Copenhagen, but during the struggle the younger Hares breaks loose and throws himself to his death. Tarzi manages to find several hidden cellphones in the apartment, from which Martin traces calls from a restaurant in Almer√≠a. They deduce that Al-Din intends to use a ferry to escape to friendly territory in North Africa, where he‚Äôll be effectively untraceable. Tarzi travels to Almer√≠a and attempts to find Al-Din by torturing one of his underlings, but gets nothing. Despite being suspended, Toft remains resolute in finding Tarzi. Along with Boe, who also wants to avenge Hansen, the two travel unsupervised to Brussels, but during the drive receive a phone call from Hansen‚Äôs wife Hanne that he has died in hospice. Heartbroken, Alex reveals that she and Lars had been having an affair and he‚Äôd been intending to divorce Hanne and start a family with her. When a shocked Toft pushes back, Boe reveals intimate photos of the two together and an ultrasound, indicating she's carrying his child. The two fail to find leads in Brussels, but learn that Tarzi has been spotted in Almer√≠a and quickly change course for southern Spain. As they‚Äôre driving from the airport, they spot one of Al-Din‚Äôs tomato delivery trucks, and Toft deduces the connection. They follow the truck, eventually stumbling across Al-Din himself in another. They follow him to a bullfighting area, where he and several others splinter off into the ring and nearby building. Toft follows Al-Din to the roof of the building, while Boe follows the others into the arena, where she spots one of them causing a distraction while another gets into a strategic location. Al- Din‚Äôs men fly a camera drone into the arena, intending to film their comrade‚Äôs suicide bombing. Just in the nick of time, Toft and Boe realize what is happening and intervene, shooting Al-Din in the process. Boe calls Wold, who in turn calls Martin, who proposes a trade - Tarzi for Al-Din. They meet on the rooftop, but Al-Din dies from his wounds. A distraught Tarzi asks Toft to kill him, but Martin makes clear that he intends to use the vengeful assassin as an asset for years to come. Suddenly, Boe arrives and shoots and kills Tarzi, avenging Lars. A disappointed Martin walks away, leaving an emotionally-drained Toft and Boe alone.

Walk-on extras were selected at the Estadio de los Juegos Mediterr√°neos. Shooting in the Almer√≠a bullring was cut short due to problems with the number of extras required. Christina Hendricks was replaced by Carice van Houten in the lead female role. When shooting finished in Spain, De Palma moved on to continue in Denmark. Despite De Palma has denied rumours that the final cut, clocking in at 89 minutes, was shortened against his wishes (an erroneous original running time of 148 minutes has been cited by reviewers), he declared: \\"I was not involved in the ADR, the musical recording sessions, the final mix or the colour timing of the final print.\\" In an interview with theplaylist.net he precised: \\"Domino is not my project, I did not write the script [...]. I had a lot of problems in financing [it]. I never experienced such a horrible movie set. A large part of our team has not even been paid yet by the Danish producers. [...] This was my first experience in Denmark and most likely my last.\\" Release The film was released on May 31, 2019. Reception =Box office= Domino grossed $426,238. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 4.46/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A rote thriller whose few flourishes serve as bittersweet reminders of its director's glory days, Domino continues a streak of DePalma disappointments.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"What's most frustrating about Domino is just how invisible De Palma has become, bringing a tired script to screen without any real panache or even effort, the work of a man who's seemingly given up.\\" David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, describing it as \\"A messy, uneven, heavy-handed, occasionally inspired, often insipid, steroidally stylistic De Palma joint, but one that fits the description in enough fits and starts to warrant the claim.\\" Peter Sobcynzki of RogerEbert.com gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"This is not a great Brian De Palma film in the end, but its best moments will remind you of just how great he can be.\\" References External links * * Official website (in Japanese)  Domino at Box Office Mojo Category:2019 films Category:Belgian films Category:Belgian crime thriller films Category:Danish films Category:Danish crime thriller films Category:Dutch films Category:Dutch crime thriller films Category:French films Category:French crime thriller films Category:Italian films Category:Italian crime thriller films Category:Films directed by Brian De Palma Category:Films scored by Pino Donaggio Category:Films about terrorism in Europe Category:Films set in 2020 Category:Films set in Amsterdam Category:Films set in Andalusia Category:Films set in Brussels Category:Films set in Copenhagen Category:Films shot in Denmark Category:Films shot in Antwerp Category:Films shot in Sardinia Category:Films shot in Almer√≠a Category:Films shot in Amsterdam Category:Saban Films films ","title":"Domino (2019 film)"},{"id":"56990060","text":"is a football stadium in Narashino, Chiba, Japan.

The red-brick Georgian building was constructed in 1764 as the parish workhouse. Early in the 20th century it was acquired by local antiquarian Herbert Druitt and his collections provided the basis for a public museum that opened in 1951. The Red House is now a Grade II* listed building. History In 1745 the churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor for Christchurch purchased a barn on the corner of Church Lane and Quay Road to provide \\"more comfortable support\\" for the town's numerous poor.Newman (2000) p.13. In 1764 a purpose-built, red-brick poorhouse was constructed on the site,Newman (2000) p.15. and this remained in use as the local workhouse until it was replaced in 1881 by a larger Union Workhouse that had been newly constructed in the fields to the north of the town.Newman (2000) p.58. The last inmates to leave the increasingly decrepit Quay Road site were the \\"juvenile paupers\\", the children, who were finally relocated in 1886.Newman (2000) p.61. The dilapidated building was bought at auction by the Rev Thomas H Bush, the vicar of the nearby Priory Church, who named it the 'RedHouse'. The Rev Bush undertook many alterations and demolished some of the buildings. He erected stables on the site of the original barn, transformed the former exercise yards into gardens, and built a stone garden wall facing Quay Road where the women's ward had previously stood. The Red House remained a family home until the death of Rev Bush in 1909.Newman (2000) p.61. The Red House was then purchased by Matilda Druitt, the widow of solicitor James Druitt, whose home in the High Street is now Christchurch Library.Newman (2000) p.61. After her death in 1916 the Red House passed to her solicitor son Herbert who, being a passionate local antiquarian and an outspoken champion of the town's history, used it as a storehouse for his vast collection of local documents, archaeological artefacts, and works of art. Although Herbert Druitt would open the Red House to visitors by private arrangement, his desire that it should become a permanent museum for the town remained unrealised before his death in 1943. The Red House passed to his sister Charlotte, who gifted the building to the town in 1947.Newman (2000) p.62. It took the trustees of the new museum three years to get the Red House and its overgrown garden to a state in which it could fulfil Charlotte's legacy and Herbert's wish.Newman (2000) p.63. It was intended that the Red House should be more than just a museum and the executors of artist Graham Robertson donated ¬£1,000 towards the cost of an art gallery. The opening ceremony of the Red House Museum was performed on Wednesday 30th May 1951 by Sir Donald Bailey, the inventor of the military Bailey Bridge, who lived locally. Because it was opened as part of the town's Festival of Britain celebrations, entry was free for the first two weeks, after which a sixpenny (6d) entry fee was introduced. In 1971 the running of the Museum was taken over by Hampshire County Council. Following the changes to the county boundaries in 1974, when Christchurch was transferred from Hampshire to Dorset, Hampshire County Council retained control and set up a joint management agreement with Dorset County Council and Christchurch Borough Council. Present Day Saxon grave goods on display in the Red House Museum. The Red House Museum is a free entry museum of local history. The ground floor features a Kitchen Gallery, Victorian Bygones Gallery, costume and fashion collections, and an exhibition of 1930s furniture by the noted Christchurch- based craftsman Arthur Romney Green. The Main Gallery in the former stables hosts regular temporary exhibitions.

Before January 1920, it was named the Southern Front.  Operations  In January-February 1920, the Front forces, pursuing the retreating White forces of Denikin, successfully conducted the Odessa operation and occupied Odessa on February 7. By March 1 the Front reached the line Mozyr-Ovruch-Korosten-Letichev-Dniester River, but attempts to seize the Crimea, defended by the White Army under the command of General Yakov Slashchov, ended unsuccessfully. Then the Front troops acted on two strategic directions : the Western against Poland, and the Crimean against the Army of Wrangel. In April-May 1920, countering the advancing Polish troops, they left Mozyr, Ovruch, Korosten, Kiev and moved to the left bank of the Dnieper. In May and June, they launched a counteroffensive and successfully conducted the Kiev operation, after which they continued their pursuit of the enemy in the zone from Polesia to the Dniester. in June-July, during the Novohrad-Volynskyi and Rivne operations, the Front troops defeated the Polish and reached the approaches to Lublin and Lvov, but they could not seize Lvov and in August 1920 they were forced to retreat. The troops of the Front also fought the armed detachments of Bulak-Balakhovich, Petlyura and Boris Savinkov. On October 18, after the conclusion of the Truce with Poland, the Front's operations were stopped and the troops withdrew behind the state border. On the Crimean front, in June-July, under the pressure of Wrangel's army the Front forces withdrew to the right bank of the Dnieper and conducted defensive battles on the Kherson-Nikopol-Tokmak-Berdyansk line. In August, they launched an offensive and occupied the Kakhovka bridgehead. In September, the enemy succeeded in pushing back the troops of the left wing of the 13th Army, and in occupying Alexandrovsk, Orekhov and Sinelnikovo, creating a threat to the Donbas Region. In September 1920, the Crimean section of the South-Western Front was separated into an independent Southern Front (2nd formation). The Front was disbanded on December 5, 1920 and the Front Administration merged with the Administration of the Kiev Military District, to which all the front troops became subordinated.

It was released under the name Kaoru Amane, the lead character of the series portrayed by Sawajiri, through Sony Music Records on August 30, 2006. The single broke several records, scoring the best first-week sales of a debut single by a female solo artist, and becoming the first debut single by an actress in twelve years to top the Oricon Singles Chart, since Yuki Uchida's debut with \\"Tenca o Tor≈ç! (Uchida no Yab≈ç)\\" (1994). Background \\"Taiy≈ç no Uta\\" was written by Japanese singer-songwriter and daughter of Emiko Shiratori, Maika Shiratori. The song was arranged by Junji Yayoshi and produced by Yoshio Konno. It is composed in the key of G major and set to a tempo of 84 beats per minute. Sawajiri's vocals span from G3 to C5. Lyrically, the song describes a woman who gains hope for the future through falling in love. Shiratori used the plot of the series as inspiration for the lyrics. In 2007, she self-covered the song for her fourth studio album Hikousen. Chart performance \\"Taiy≈ç no Uta\\" debuted at number 2 on the Oricon Singles Chart with 150,000 copies sold, held out of the top spot by GYM's \\"Fever to Future\\". The song broke and updated several records upon its release.

It also became the first debut single by an actress to chart in the top three for two consecutive weeks in over sixteen years, since Rie Miyazawa's \\"Dream Rush\\" (1989). Finally, it became the first single released under the pseudonym of a fictional character, since Yui Asaka, Yuka Onishi and Yuma Nakamura's joint release as the Kazama Sisters from the Sukeban Deka III series, \\"Remember\\" (1987), to top the Oricon Singles Chart in close to nineteen years, as well as the second single overall to achieve the feat. On its third week, \\"Taiy≈ç no Uta\\" slid back down to number 2, dethroned by Glay's \\"Natsuoto\\" / \\"Hen na Yume (Thousand Dreams)\\", and became the first debut single by a female solo artist to chart in the top three for three consecutive weeks.

The general caste people are very thin. The livelihood of the locality is agriculture. Hardly few people are living on business and other different jobs. The educational background of this area is very backward because of the lack of academic atmosphere. Only few schools and one junior college is the only for the 10 + 2 education to the needy students. For higher education the aspirant students are to move to a long distance.

The H√∂llbachschwelle The H√∂llbachgspreng is a wooded rock massif below the Gro√üer Falkenstein mountain in the vicinity of Lindberg in the Bavarian Forest, Germany.  Description  This terrain hollow with extremely steep sides owes its formation to the last ice age. A mountain trail runs through the ancient forest here. Through a narrow, ravine the H√∂llbach rushes between, gneiss rocks as high as a house in places. On the northern boundary of the region it drops as a waterfall into the depths. The western part of the area is dominated by the Gro√üer Falkenstein. The slopes are covered with trees such as sycamore, Norway spruce, beech, silver fir and wych elm. The undergrowth includes rare plants like alpine lady-fern, chickweed-wintergreen, sundews, martagon lily and Hungarian gentian. On the rocks grows the very rare sulphur dust lichen (Schwefelflechte). As far as birds are concerned the region is relatively species-poor with only 36 types occurring, the course of the stream with its associated draught of cold air being mainly responsible.Wolfgang Scherzinger: Die Vogelwelt der Urwaldgebiete im Bayerischen Wald, 1986, p. 79  Access  A trail leads through the gorge to the summit of the Gro√üer Falkenstein. The wild and romantic path is only recommended forexperienced and determined hikers because it is very steep, in places crosses the rocks of the stream and fallen trees may have to be negotiated. In any case, sure-footedness and stout footwear are essential. The ascent from the H√∂llbachschwelle takes about hours.  Nature reserve  As early as around 1860, nature lovers argued that the region, which was difficult to access, should remain free of forestry activity. As a result, its ancient woodland character has survived. The H√∂llbachgspreng Nature Reserve (Naturschutzgebiet H√∂llbachgspreng) was established by the governments of Lower Bavaria and Upper Palatinate on 17 January 1941 (Reg.Anz. Ausg. 26/28). It has an area of 51.3 ha. Since the expansion of the national park in 1997 it has been part of the Bavarian Forest National Park. Climbing on the rocks of the H√∂llbachgspreng is forbidden at any time of the year.

Political parties  *The Green Party voted to oppose the HS2 plans at its Spring 2011 conference on environmental and economic grounds. Alan Francis, the party transport spokesperson, had previously outlined its support for high-speed rail in principle in terms of benefits to capacity, reduced journey times and reduced carbon emissions, but recommended a line restricted to which would enable it to use existing transport corridors to a greater extent and increase efficiency. * The UK Independence Party (UKIP) is opposed nationally and locally to the proposed HS2 plans. UKIP has been campaigning against HS2 as it is also part of the EU's Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) Policy. It had previously proposed a much larger and more expensive three-line high-speed network running from London to Newcastle (and on to Scotland), London to Bristol (and on to Wales) and London to Birmingham along with upgrading several other sections of the WCML and Scottish rail to high speed in its 2010 manifesto. * The Brexit Party said in 2019 it would save ¬£200 billion by shelving the HS2 project.  Campaign groups  *Stop HS2 organises nationally and represents local action groups along the route, under the slogan \\"No business case. No environmental case. No money to pay for it.\\". Chair Penny Gaines commented in 2020 that \\"The case for HS2 has always been poor, and is simply getting worse\\". *Extinction Rebellion, a global protest movement. Alongside Stop HS2, Extinction Rebellion organised a walk of 125 miles along the proposed railway line in June 2020. *The HS2 Action Alliance was an umbrella group for opposition groups. These included ad hoc entities, residents' associations, and parish councils. The Alliance's primary aim was to prevent HS2 from happening; secondary aims included evaluating and minimising the impacts of HS2 on individuals, communities and the environment, and communication of facts about HS2, and its compensation scheme. The HS2 Action Alliance criticised the Department of Transport's demand forecasts as being too high, as well as having other shortcomings in the assessment methodology. * Action Groups Against High Speed Two (AGHAST) claimed in 2011 that the project was not viable economically. *The Right Lines Charter, an umbrella group established in 2011 for several environmental and other organisations that support the principle of a high-speed rail network but believe that the current HS2 scheme is unsound. Members include the Campaign for Better Transport, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and Railfuture. *Railfuture, a railway campaigning organisation, supports high-speed rail in principle but stated in its submission to the Transport Select Committee Inquiry that it sees no benefit in trains running at up to and therefore is not in favour of the current proposal and route, and suggests that alternatives be investigated.Written evidence from Railfuture to the Transport Select Committee. UK Parliament. May 2011. Retrieved 7 July 2011.  Environmental groups  thumb *The Woodland Trust opposes the current route of the proposed High Speed 2 rail link because of its impact on ancient woodland. It reports that 108 ancient woods are threatened with loss or damage from the project. *The Wildlife Trusts, which have criticised the proposals, stating that the former Government's policy on High Speed Rail (March 2010) underestimated the effect on wildlife habitats (with 4 SSSIs and over 50 of other types of nature site affected), as well as noting that the proposals had not comprehensively shown any significant effect on transport carbon emissions and questioning the economic benefits of a line. The trusts called for additional research to be done on the effects of a high- speed line. * The Selborne Society voiced its concern about the proximity of HS2 to Perivale Wood, a Local Nature Reserve in Ealing. *The Campaign to Protect Rural England believes that lower speeds would increase journey times only slightly, while allowing the line to run along existing motorway and railway corridors, reducing intrusion.  Other groups  *The National Trust. Fiona Reynolds, at the time Director-General, stated in 2010: \\"there are lots of questions about the economics and above all the impact\\". *The New Economics Foundation, a think-tank promoting environmentalism, localism and anti-capitalism. It published a formal response to the public consultation in August 2011 which concluded that the case for a high-speed rail link was incomplete and that the benefits of the scheme had been \\"over-emphasised\\" by its promoters. *The Taxpayers Alliance, an anti-tax pressure group, describes the project as a white elephant. *The Independent newspaper considers the costs excessive and the benefits uncertain. An investigation published in February 2013 claimed that 350 wildlife sites would be destroyed by the new HS2 line and an accompanying editorial argued that environmentalists should oppose the project.

In 1119 Cadouin was made an abbey under its first abbot, Henri, a monk of Pontigny Abbey, the second daughter house of C√Æteaux Abbey, but seems to have remained independent of the Cistercian Order until around 1199. Cadouin founded daughter houses of its own (Grandselve Abbey, Gondon Abbey, Bonnevaux Abbey, Ardorel Abbey, La Faise Abbey and Saint-Marcel Abbey) which also became Cistercian, not necessarily at the same time as Cadouin itself. At an uncertain date the monastery came into possession of what was believed to be the facecloth from the tomb of Christ (), said to have been brought from Antioch by a priest of P√©rigord. In some traditional accounts the cloth is linked to the Bishop of Le Puy, Adh√©mar de Monteil, who died in 1098, but it is not documented in the possession of the abbey until 1214. It made Cadouin Abbey an important place of pilgrimage and brought it great prestige and wealth. Cadouin was also only 50 kilometres or so east of the Via Lemovicensis, one of the four main routes of the Way of Saint James through France. The wars of the 13th and 14th centuries however brought about a dramatic collapse in the number of pilgrimages. In 1791 the abbey, which by then had only four monks, was dissolved in the French Revolution. Its rich possessions were looted and its library was burnt in the village square. The abbey church still stands. Sources * Marcel Aubert, Cadouin, in Congr√®s arch√©ologique de France. 90e session.

Written by Christopher Hollier & Adam Karp, and directed by Ellen S. Pressman, it premiered on ABC in the United States on March 30, 2018. In the episode, Ivy must find a way to help Anastasia as the mysterious killer continues to hunt down more victims, while Henry tries to get over his feelings towards Jacinda during a night out with Rogers and Nick. In the past, Drizella is tempted by Gothel to joining The Coven of Eight, but has to face a test after she pairs up with another prospect, Gretel. The killer is finally revealed. \\"Sisterhood\\" is Adelaide Kane's final episode in the show. Plot =Opening sequence= Flynn's Barcade Bar is featured in the background. =In the Characters' Past= In a flashback during the new realm, a young Drizella is playing hide- and-seek with Anastasia, but when Drizella gets lost, Anastasia lights a lantern that leads Drizella to her. Anastasia then says that as long as they're together, they can always find their way home. Years later, and with Anastasia now lying in a comatose state, Drizella admitted to having cast the new dark curse in order to make her mother suffer. Regina soon joined Drizella to offer help but turned her down, just in time to reveal Regina as Gothel in disguise and tempting her with an offer to join a group of women known as the Coven of Eight. As Drizella accepted the offer, Gothel only had two spots left while going through a recruiting process. Gothel says she's hidden two golden flowers somewhere in the forest and whoever brings her the flowers will prove themselves worthy of joining the Coven. Gothel tells Drizella that she has to do the task alone, but she instead partners up with another recruit named Gretel. As the two women bond over having to deal with the loss of a sibling, with Gretel revealing how her brother Hansel had changed after the events of dealing with a witch but has never been the same since and has taken on a new identity. Both Drizella and Gretel comes across a fork in the road, the two agreed to separate then meet up. During this separation, Gothel appears to Drizella to reveal that the test was actually an elimination that determines eligibility into the sisterhood. Gothel wants Drizella to kill Gretel with a sai or tekpi type weapon but Drizella decided against it because of Gothel's true intentions. When Gretel returns, Drizella suggest that they form their own sisterhood in order to get what they wanted, but soon that idea is scratched when Gretel reveals the same weapon that Drizella had. It turns out Gothel had set them both up with orders to kill one another. The women soon fight each other but as Gretel was about to kill her Drizella sends her weapon towards Gretel and she kills her instead. Gothel appears to Drizella, telling her that she has been accepted into the Coven of Eight, thus marking the events leading up to the Dark Curse. =In The Present Day= As Ivy continues her search for Anastasia, she is enticed by Gothel to once again join her Coven, but Ivy turns down Gothel's offers as she wants her sister's powers and she will not sacrifice herself in order to do so. Gothel then hands her a heart shaped box of chocolates which were outside in the lobby (implying that she is the next target), warning her of a serial killer that are after women who have ties to the Coven, but Ivy doesn't believe Gothel's story, that is, until later on that night when the masked Candy Killer goes after Ivy but she escaped his attempts. Ivy then approached Regina for help afterwards. Regina is still upset over what Ivy did to her and Henry but agreed to help. As Regina consulted Weaver on this situation, Ivy is approached by Samdi, who knows about what and why the Candy Killer is after her. Samdi tells Ivy the only way to save both her and Anastasia is using a magic bean that can create a portal, using reinforcement by Anastasia's powers. Later that evening, Ivy and Anastasia finally meet up, with Ivy ready to forgive Anastasia and promised to help each other get home to their realm with a magic bean. But instead of pulling the bean out of her pocket, she pulled out poppy dust, betraying Anastasia and putting her to sleep. When Ivy takes Anastasia back to Samdi, their attempt to exorcise her powers is interrupted by Gothel, who wakes her up and compels her to kill Ivy. However, Ivy pleads with Anastasia, saying that if she does kill her she would end up giving in to Gothel's control, but Anastasia refuses to kill her sister, much to the dismay of Gothel, who escapes angrily. When Regina and Weaver arrived to see the damage done in the place, they're relieved to see Ivy and Anastasia embraced each other as sisters again. Ivy also apologized to Regina for what she did to Henry and her, with Regina saying she understands. As Ivy and Anastasia say goodbye to Regina and Weaver, Anastasia uses her magic to create the portal, and they go back to their realm. Back at the bar, Regina confronted Samdi over what happened, but Samdi assures Regina that he was doing this to save Henry by extracting Anastasia's magic into a bottle so Henry will live once his curse is broken but at the same time warns Regina about Weaver's intentions. And as Samdi leaves the bar, Weaver is waiting for him, saying that he's keeping the dagger in his possession, despite Samdi's cautionary message about Weaver's desire to be with Belle. In between the events, Lucy and Regina come up with a way to perk up Henry while at the same time must keep him and Jacinda from kissing each other, so Regina suggests that Henry get together with Rogers and Nick for a night out (since Hook and Jack were his best friends in the past life). Thanks to Regina texting Rogers and Nick, the guys are able to track Henry to Flynn's Barcade, a local bar that Henry frequents. The two suddenly decided to stick around and help Henry out with his romantic feelings towards Jacinda, giving Nick an idea by making a bet that Henry can move on from Jacinda, by asking out the first woman who walks into the bar, who, as fate would have it, was Jacinda herself. After the two talk for a while, Jacinda challenge Henry to a game in which he had a coin that if he tossed it into a glass then he would believe in the fairytales that Lucy had told him. When he threw the coin, a bartender takes up the glass and it misses. However, Jacinda doesn't stay long as she has to meet up with Sabine later; surprisingly enough when Jacinda threw a coin into a glass back at home, she succeeded. Hours later after the bar closes, Henry, Rogers, and Nick say their goodbyes, with Nick wishing Rogers good luck on the case. Unbeknownst to Henry and Rogers, after they left Nick alone to fix a flat tire, Nick opens up his car trunk which revealed the heart-shaped boxes, envelopes, objects, and the mask, thus revealing him to be the Candy Killer who has been targeting the coven witches.

Etymology Acorn Creek takes its name from Acorn Town, a Creek Indian settlement and plantation which stood near its mouth. The original Muskogee name for this stream was Lakcv-hache. The plantation was home to Chief McIntosh of the Lower Creek indigenous peoples, and was known by various names: Acorn Town, Acorn Bluff, and Lochau Talofau. History William McIntosh, 1838 by Charles Bird King Acorn Creek today is located near the boundary of the McIntosh Reserve, a outdoor recreation area operated by the Carroll County Recreation Department. Carroll County acquired Lochau Talofau and established the Reserve in 1978. The Reserve contains a portion, but not all, of the larger 19th-century plantation of Acorn Bluff. The Reserve is named for William McIntosh, a prominent Creek Indian leader and planter who maintained a home and plantation at the site. McIntosh named his plantation Lochau Talofau, which in English means Acorn Bluff (less frequently Acorn Town) and was one square mile in size, encompassing the lower reaches of Acorn Creek.; At Acorn Bluff, McIntosh constructed a simple two-story log house which he used as both a residence and as an inn for travelers. A replica of the house was constructed after the purchase of the Reserve, and is open to park visitors. McIntosh and the Lower Creek tribes sided with the United States government (against the British and their Red Stick Creek allies) in the Creek War of 1813-1814. McIntosh distinguished himself in the battles of Autossee and Horseshoe Bend, and was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General.Griffith (1998), McIntosh and Weatherford, p. 1 He again fought beside General Andrew Jackson in the First Seminole War of 1816-1819. A hero to many, McIntosh provoked the wrath of his fellow Creeks when he signed the second Treaty of Indian Springs, in 1825. The treaty essentially sold all Creek lands in Georgia and Alabama to the United States government. McIntosh was allowed to keep his plantation in exchange for signing the treaty. The sale of ancestral lands was opposed by the Creek National Council, which saw the act as both unauthorized and illegal. The Treaty of the Creek Agency (1818), which previously ceded two smaller portions of Creek lands, had moved the Council to propose the execution of McIntosh. While McIntosh survived that earlier confrontation with the Creek National Council, the treaty of 1825 was his undoing. The Council ruled that McIntosh and other signatories had committed a capital offense against the Creek government and people by ceding communal lands, and ordered their execution.Michael D. Green, The Politics of Indian Removal: Creek Government and Society in Crisis, University of Nebraska Press, 1985, pp. 96-97, accessed 14 September 2011 McIntosh was murdered at his home, Acorn Bluff, in 1825. McIntosh's grave is located in the McIntosh Reserve, adjacent to his reconstructed home. Georgia Historical Marker 022-3 (1984) marks the location of Brigadier-General McIntosh's home and burial site. Geology and watershed The stream originates just west of the city of Whitesburg, Georgia and empties into the Chattahoochee River in Carroll County. The Acorn Creek- Chattahoochee River watershed has a total area of 28,284 acres. The Acorn Creek-Chattahoochee River watershed is part of the larger Middle Chattahoochee-Lake Harding watershed which has an area of 1,950,182 acres. In Carroll County, where Acorn Creek flows into the path of the Chattahoochee river, the scar of the Brevard Fault is visible. The fault is a geologic feature that spans several states. From Atlanta to eastern Alabama, an area which includes Acorn Creek, the rock units that characterize the fault outcrop in widths rarely exceeding 600 feet (180 meters) yet extend along strike for 80 miles (128 km). The Chattahoochee, at McIntosh Reserve, becomes a shallow shoal. A guide to that area notes \\"The rugged landscape is evidence of the Brevard Fault zone, so prominent along [this] section of the river\\". The fault line is delineated where the banks of the Chattahoochee are \\"studded with huge boulders [which] rise 80 feet above the river\\". Within a few miles, downstream of Acorn Creek, the Brevard Fault leaves the Chattahoochee River and \\"continues in a south-westerly direction into Alabama\\". McIntosh Reserve Park was closed for several months in 2009 and 2010, following the September 2009 flooding along the Chattahoochee River corridor and Acorn Creek. The park reopened Memorial Day weekend, 2010. Environmental assessment An environmental assessment of the creek, performed in 1987-88 by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources - Environmental Protection Division (EPD) concluded that summer fecal coliform levels from both point and nonpoint pollution sources were within total maximum daily load target levels and no additional reductions were required. The stream is a popular fishing location. One online fishing site lists Shoal bass as the most popular species of fish caught in Acorn Creek. References Further reading * Green, Michael D.

Peter Yulievich Schmidt attended the gymnasium of KI May before studying at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg University, from where he graduated in 1895. He was engaged in the laboratory of Professor V.M. Shimkevich and V.T. Shevyakov. He travelled through Semirechiy in 1899-1902. In 1908-1910 he participated in the Kamchatka expedition of F. P. Ryabushinsky, where he headed the zoological department. In 1906, he was awarded with a gold medal named after Petr Petrovich Semyonov by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. In 1906-1930 he held the position of a professor at the Agricultural Institute in St. Petersburg (Leningrad) and from 1914-1931 he worked at the Zoological Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences. From 1930-1949 Schmidt was a scientific secretary to the Pacific Committee of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1938 he was arrested. along with a group of other employees of the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, by the NKVD because they had non-Russian surnames. Schmidt was suspected of espionage for Germany and Japan on the grounds that he had been on scientific missions in Berlin and Tokyo. After interrogation, during which the 66-year-old professor was knocked out, he signed the protocol as required by the NKVD investigators and also confessed to being an Italian spy, as his daughter lived in Italy. Eventually he was released and was able to continue his scientific activity.

Even while he was at university, he received a gold medal for a study of millipedes a gold medal. His best known work came after 1900 when he began to study the fish fauna of the Pacific and Ichthyology in its broader sense.

Biography =Early life and scientific activity= Khudoyor Yusufbekovich Yusufbekov was born on December 10, 1928 in Pish, a village in Darmorakht subdistrict of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO) in the Tajik ASSR, USSR in the family of a kolkhoz member-gardener. He was 10 years old when his mother passed away. After finishing the seventh grade school in his village, he worked as a kolkhoz farmer and as a laborer in the construction of a road (1945‚Äî1946). In 1949, he graduated the Kirov secondary school in Khorog, and in 1949‚Äî1954, he studied in Tajik Agricultural Institute.During his studies, he showed interest towards scientific activities and actively participated in the work of the scientific circle at the agronomic faculty. Starting from 1954, he began his scientific activities in the Pamir Botanical Garden, where he worked under the supervision of Anatoly Gursky and did research on consolidation and developing of sand and pebble massifs in Ishkashim District, as well as work over developing the collections and production nurseries in the Pamir Botanical Garden. In 1956, Khudoyor Yusufbekov performed his first experiments on the meadow formation of the desert pastures on the West Pamir. =Institute of Botany of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR= In 1957 he began his full- time post-graduate study at the Institute of Botany of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR in the city of Dushanbe under the supervision of professor Ivan Tsatsenkin (Moscow, the Williams All-Union Institute of Fodder) and pursued further his research on meadow formation of the mountainous deserted lands (slopes) in the Western Pamirs. After his graduation from the institute, he continued to work therein as a junior scientific worker. While working on further investigations of the Pamirs, he started the first experiments of improving the pastures in the central parts of Tajikistan (Kondara and Rangontay). During these years, Khudoyor Yusufbekov formulated and experimentally proved methods of creating highly productive forage lands by means of different types of irrigation systems for sowing grasses without disturbance of natural vegetation. The results of such investigations and tests introduced into the kolkhoz farm production of the Shughnan and Ishkashim districts of the GBAO in large areas were the basis of the master's thesis defended by him in 1961. =Pamir Biological Station of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR in Chechekty near Murghab= In 1962‚Äî1969, he was the director of the Pamir Biological Station of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR, in the location of Chechekty (3860 meters above sea level) near Murghab ‚Äî East Pamir,In 1963, he was awarded the academic title of senior researcher in the field of land reclamation and irrigated agriculture. In 1966, he joined the ranks of members of the CPSU. at the same time in 1965, he was elected the Chairman of the Bureau of the Pamir Base of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR. During the working period at the biostation, he launched experimental work on improvement of pastures and hayfields in all areas of the GBAO, as well as the Alay Valley of the Kirghiz SSR. Under his leadership at the Pamir Biostation in 1964, three laboratories were created: * physiology and biochemistry of plants; * introduction of plants; * experimental geobotany. The scientific research activity of the biostation (the beginning of manifestation of the scientific and organizational abilities of Khudoyor Yusufbekov) acquired a complex character. Here, along with the problems of ecological physiology and biochemistry of plants initiated by Professor Oleg Zalensky, further studies were carried out on experimental geobotanics, phyto- amelioration, soil studies, microorganisms, climatology, and the issues of crop cultivation in the Eastern Pamirs. During the years of his work, the number of employees and the volume of scientific research significantly increased, which had a positive effect on the activities of the biostation. The traditions of the biostation laid by Pavel Baranov, Ilariya Raikova,. Oleg Zalensky and Kirill Stanyukovich found a decent continuation in the activities of Khudoyor Yusufbekov. During his work at the Pamir Biostation, Khudoyor Yusufbekov strengthened the material and technical base of the biological station with trucks, laboratory equipment, and chemical reagents in order to improve the conditions of the Pamir expeditionary survey and continued to improve methods for improving the desert and steppe pastures of the Pamir- Alay, by studying the structure of vegetation, and the topographical and ecological conditions of high-mountain pastures in a wide geographical and high-altitude range. As a result, he developed a system of improving the feeding grounds of the Pamirs and the Alay Valley, differentiated by eco- geographical regions and high-altitude belts, and presented the findings in the form of a monograph published in 1968. In 1968, Khudoyor Yusufbekov was elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR. In 1969, the monograph ¬´–£–ª—É—á—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–∞—Å—Ç–±–∏—â –∏ —Å–µ–Ω–æ–∫–æ—Å–æ–≤ –ü–∞–º–∏—Ä–∞ –∏ –ê–ª–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–π –¥–æ–ª–∏–Ω—ã¬ª (\\"Improvement of pastures and hayfields of the Pamir and Alai Valley\\") was presented as a thesis (Moscow, the Williams All-Union Feed Institute), which Khudoyor Yusufbekov successfully defended to receive the degree of Doctor of Agricultural Sciences. =Pamir Biological Institute= In October 1968, the President of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh arrived in the Pamirs and visited the Pamir Botanical Garden. He was accompanied by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Tajik SSR , the President of the Academy of the Tajik SSR, Muhammad Osimi, and the First Secretary of the Gorno-Badakhshan Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, . Khudoyor Yusufbekov reported in details history of Pamir study to the high-ranking guests, about its natural resources, about the problems that needed to be solved in the field of biology, agriculture and, at the end, having justified the question of the necessity of creating a biological institute in the Pamirs, he asked the support of Mstislav Keldysh in consideration and resolution of this issue in Moscow. With the expansion and deepening of research at the Pamir Biological station, as well as growth of the number of scientific staff and taking into account the unique conditions in Pamir and in order to coordinate all studies related to the arid mountain areas, he stressed out the importance of this. Soon, the president of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, Muhammad Osimi, and Khudoyor Yusufbekov were invited to Moscow to participate in the discussion of the establishment of a biological institute. At a joint meeting of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR State Committee on Science and Technology, the issue was resolved positively. In 1969, all the biological agencies of Pamir such as the Pamir Biological Station in the Eastern Pamir (3860 m above sea level), Pamir Botanical Garden near the town of Khorugh (2320 m above sea level), and the outpost in Ishkashim (2600 m above sea level) were combined by Khudoyor Yusufbekov into the Pamir Biological Institute, the first director of which he became after its foundation (1969‚Äî1981). Currently, the institute is named after him (1992). Khudoyor Yusufbekov's scientific and organizational abilities were revealed at the post of director of the institute. Along with scientific work, he also led a great deal of organizational activity. He determined the structure of the units of the Institute. Along with the traditional lines of research, he started scientific works on zoology, genetics plant breeding, and nature protection. In 1970‚Äî1975, Khudoyor Yusufbekov developed a scheme for the master plan for development of the Anatoly Gursky Pamir Botanical Garden. To develop the scientific base, expand the areas of the botanical garden and preserve typical biological objects, more than 600 hectares of land in the vicinity of the botanical garden were obtained. In addition, 19 hectares of irrigated lands were connected to the territory of the garden, on the basis of which experimental sections of the Institute's units were organized. During the years of Khudoyor Yusufbekov's direct leadership (since 1965 till September 1990) of the fruit growing laboratory, situated at the altitude of 2700‚Äì3500 m, the area dedicated to the collection of global flora increased by 7 times, and the collection itself increased by 10 times, up to 4000 species and subspecies. The collections of plants in the garden are arranged according to geographical principles, and the irrigated territory is divided into 5 floristic departments: Central Asia and East Asia, Europe and the Caucasus, North America, the Himalayas, and the Hindu Kush. Inside the departments, the plants are arranged in generic complexes, taking into account ecological features of the species. In accordance with specifics of the objects of research in the garden, three groups were formed: dendrology, fodder and medicinal plants, and floriculture. The main task of the Pamir Botanical Garden was the introduction of plants. It exchanged seeds of highland flora and planting material with 112 gardens inside the USSR and 118 gardens from 39 major botanical centers of Europe (East Germany, West Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia), North America (Canada and the United States), and other countries of the world. In 1972, a pumping station was built, thanks to which the waters of the river Shahdara raised to a height of 180 m. This enabled expanding the irrigated territory from 22 to 118 hectares at an altitude of 2140‚Äì2360 m, by over 5 times. The area of 4 floristic departments increased by 2 ‚Äî 4 times. A laboratory, residential buildings, and the road and irrigation systems inside the garden of the Institute were built. In Darvaz, a support center for introduction and acclimatization of subtropical and citrus plants in an 8 hectare area. Initiated in 1975 under his leadership, the experiments on introduction of citrus and other subtropical cultures in Darvaz proved the prospects for development of citrus cultivation in the Kalayikhumb district of the GBAO. At the Julius Fuƒç√≠k Sovkhoz (state farm), a lemon orchard was planted on a 1 hectare area, as well as pomegranate and fig gardens on 8 hectares. To the same extent, studies of shape diversity and distribution of sea buckthorn were successfully launched in 1976. Several forms of low-thorned sea buckthorn with high oil content were identified. Expediency of cultivating sea buckthorn on pebbles in floodplains of Pamir rivers was proved. Khudoyor Yusufbekov's scientific interests covered a wide range of issues related to study of the nature of the Pamirs. Along with solving the problem of improving pastures, he collected significant material on protection, restoration and purposeful reconstruction of the vegetation of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. In the monograph \\"–†–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ü–∞–º–∏—Ä–∞ –∏ –æ–ø—ã—Ç –µ—ë —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏\\" (\\"The Vegetation of the Western Pamirs and the Experience of Its Reconstruction\\"), written jointly by , the Pamirs' territorial resources were analyzed, and he introduced the concept of a testing ground for land development (–ø–æ–ª–∏–≥–æ–Ω –º–µ–ª–∏–æ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏) of the Western Pamir. In that ground, he singled out 12 classes of land and provided valid recommendations for economic development of each of them. In the monograph, the model of the development of the Pamir, developed by Khudoyor Yusufbekov, is presented in the most complete form. Its constituent elements were the issues of complex vegetation reconstruction on sandy slopes and pebbles, furrowless watering on steep rocky slopes, reconstruction of vegetation of ancient terraces, mudflow cones of erosion, etc. Mountain slopes that had been eroded were supposed to be used in particular for orchards and meadowing between the plants by sowing perennial legumes. The scheme for reconstructing the vegetation of eroded slopes was not only developed, but also successfully tested in Shugnan, Rushan and Ishkashim districts of the GBAO. Recommendations for the integrated reconstruction of vegetation on sands and gravels also found wide application in production. From just 1965 to 1980, the Gorno-Badakhshan forest organizarton created poplar and apricot plantations on an area of 1500 hectares. In the following years, planting works on blown sands and rocky terrain were conducted annually across an area of 300‚Äì350 hectares. The main ideas and methods related to the plant development of the Pamirs were described by Khudoyor Yusufbekov in addition to the previously published works in the monographs \\"–ú–µ—Ç–æ–¥—ã –≤–æ–∑–¥–µ–ª—ã–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –ü–∞–º–∏—Ä–µ\\" (\\"Methods of cultivating useful plants in the Pamirs\\", 1972), \\"–¢–µ—Ä–µ—Å–∫–µ–Ω –Ω–∞ –ü–∞–º–∏—Ä–µ\\" (\\"Teresken in the Pamirs\\", 1972), \\"Pamir\\" (1973) and in numerous brochures, collections and articles. At present more than 300 scientific works have been published. A lot of work was done to prepare and grow the scientific staff of the Institute, taking into account the specific difficulties and the remoteness of the Pamirs from major scientific centers. By the end of 1975, the Pamir Biological Institute staff numbered over 100 people, of which 45 were researchers. Scientists from other regions of the Soviet Union were invited to work at the Institute, and concrete measures were taken to train personnel on the ground through postgraduate study and competition. During the period of the leadership of Khudoyor Yusufbekov, two doctoral and more than 30 candidate dissertations were defended by just the staff of the biostation and the institute alone. At the same time, communication with many research institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences was established: Timiryazev Institute of Plant Physiology, Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy (IAE), the Institute of Botany, the Pavlovsky Institute of Zoology and Parasitology of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, and other scientific research institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Khudoyor Yusufbekov's love for the nature of the Pamirs and his concern for the preservation of the natural environment and scientific history of the Pamirs also manifested in the fact that under his leadership the Museum \\"The Nature of the Pamir\\" was organized. Later, even when he was the rector of the Tajik Agricultural Institute, he continued to take an interest in the work and development of the museum, which is now very popular among visitors, including foreigners. Khudoyor Yusufbekov, wherever he worked, created museums in which it was possible to get acquainted with the history and achievements of science in a visual form. He believed that all this served the birth of innovative research and the continuation of scientific development in the future. =Tajik Agricultural Institute= In May 1981, Khudoyor Yusufbekov was transferred to work in Dushanbe at the post of rector of the Tajik Agricultural Institute of the Main Administration of Agricultural Higher Educational Institutions of the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR (1981‚Äî1986).. Here he paid much attention to development of research work at the departments and attraction of the students to the scientific research activities in the scientific and student councils. He systematically organized conferences, meetings, and symposiums on many aspects of agricultural science. The educational base of the Institute was strengthened so the students would master practical skills in solving specific production issues; for that, new educational facilities based on the sovkhoz \\"Yavan-2\\" of the Yavan district were organized. Khudoyor Yusufbekov made significant efforts to complete the construction of a new building of the zoological engineering faculty, which was completed in 1987. Khudoyor Yusufbekov organized new departments for the preparation of highly qualified specialists of fruit and wine growing, a laboratory for collective use of scientific devices at the agronomic faculty, a laboratory of computing machinery at the faculty of economics, and three new chairs at the institute. Under him, entrance examinations using computers were held for the first time, he also created a museum dedicated to the history of the Institute. As an specialist in the introduction of new species, Khudoyor Yusufbekov made an optimal decision to reconstruct and place green spaces on the territory adjacent to the institute. He conducted teaching activities at the department of agriculture, lectured at the course \\"Meadow Fodder Production\\" for students. He was the Chairman of the specialized scientific councils for protection of Ph.D. theses on specialties \\"Plant Growing\\" and \\"Selection and Seed Farming\\". While he had this job, Khudoyor Yusufbekov still continued to conduct scientific management of the subjects of research of the Pamir Botanical Garden and the laboratory of high-altitude fruit growing, as well as supervising the work of the graduate students. =The Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR= Khudoyor Yusufbekov was the Academician Secretary of the Biological Department of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR (1986‚Äî1990). He had a wide range of scientific interests in the field of biology. The Biological department of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR was one of its subunits. It consisted of scientific instituts devoted to biology-related issues like: botany, zoology and parasitology (the institute was named after academician Yevgeny Pavlovsky), physiology and biophysics of plants, gastroenterology, general genetics and safety, and rational utilization of natural resources. The Pamir Biological Institute, later named after Khudoyor Yusufbekov himself, was also included here. In 1989, he became the Member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR. On his initiative, being at the same time the chairman of the Pamir scientific research base and a Member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, the Department of Pamir Studies from the Rudaki Institute of Language and Literature was relocated to Khorog from Dushanbe; the Department of Social and Economic Research of the Pamir Research Base in the Pamirs was established, later on the basis of these two departments after his death (11/27/1990), in 1991 the Institute of Humanities in the Pamirs was establishedIn Khorog, academician Kh. Yu. Yusufbekov, during his lifetime, organized the provision of apartments for all researchers from the city of Dushanbe. His plans included, in addition to the creation of the Institute of Humanities, to create an Institute of Glaciology and an Institute of Mathematics in the Pamirs. His organizational skills, authority, close scientific relations with many scientific research institutes of the USSR, the potential of scientists of the local Pamiris and others in the republic ‚Äî in the Soviet Union, for that period of history would allow him to put all this into practice. Death In 1990, Khudoyor Yusufbekovich Yusufbekov fell sick, passing away at the Dushanbe hospital No. 4 on November 27 of that year. On the request of the leadership of the Tajik SSR and the Academy of Science of the Tajik SSR, his body had been transported by plane to the town of Khorog where he was buried in the Pamir Botanical Garden, on the top of the highest hill.

Description  The painting shows the Mother of God standing one foot on the crescent. Mary is dressed in a long, down-to-earth dress, covered with a dark blue cloak. Her hair is dissolved, reaching her shoulders, and her head is turned to the right, slightly tilted down. Mary has slightly closed eyes, and her face is focused and gentle. Hands are folded for prayer. In the lower part of the painting, under the feet of the Mother of God you can see the winged dragon, who is dying, and next to the apple lying on the ground. Above Mother of God's figure floats God the Father with a gray beard, clothed in robes, spreading His hands over Mary, protecting Her and the whole Earth. On the right and left you can see Marian symbols like lilies among thorns, Mirror of Justice, Tree of Life on the left side and the Blue Gate, the Burning Bush and the Tower of David on the right. Clouds are visible in the image. The colors of the upper part are bright, while the bottom, where the dragon is visible, the colors are dark, showing the contrast.  History  = In Tartak√≥w = The painting was painted on a canvas stuck to the board at the beginning of the 17th century by an Italian painter and placed at the Potocki castle in the town of Tartak√≥w. \\"It imagines Blessed Virgin Mary with hands folded to pray, standing on the moon, under which the rolled-up snake bites the apple. Above her, God the Father spreads his hands\\". After the great fire of the castle, the painting found its way to chaplain Stanis≈Çaw Potocki and the local parish priest Miko≈Çaj Kucharski in 1727. After his death, the image of the Blessed Virgin, was in 1764 placed in the local Catholic church above the baptismal font and almost from the very beginning he began to be famous for favors, which meant that he was moved the following year to the high altar. In 1765 from 9 to 24 March, the painting, as it was described, \\"cried\\". From the eyes of Our Lady, bloody tears squeezed out, which fell or dried in the image. In those days, a clear glow was visible over the church, so that it was thought that a fire would break out. Many people have also seen that the picture was colored. In 1777, the painting was considered miraculous, and two years later placed in a specially prepared, on the initiative of priest Kostkiewicz, a new huge main altar. In a special book there are 407 cases of miracles made through the image, and a number of over 300 gifts for the grace received (so-called votives). = In ≈Åukawiec = In 1944, the painting was successfully saved from destruction thanks to the Poles, through his deportation to the wooden Church of the Epiphany in ≈Åukawiec near Lubacz√≥w. Initially, in 1963, the painting found itself in Lubacz√≥w, and the parish in Tarnoszyn also sought for it. In the end, however, the painting, famous for its graces, was handed over to the ≈Åukawiec parish. Due to the increasing number of the believers, both from ≈Åukawiec and from Tartak√≥w, a decision was made to build a new church in ≈Åukawiec. The Church of Blessed Virgin Mary Queen of Poland in ≈Åukawiec was consecrated by Bishop Marian Jaworski in 1990. In the same year, the image of Mary was placed in the main altar. The new church became the Sanctuary of Our Lady of ≈Åukawiec. On June 3, 1991, the painting was crowned in Lubacz√≥w by Pope John Paul II during one of his pilgrimages to Poland. On May 15, 2004, a dedicated and crowned copy of the painting was donated to the church in Tartak√≥w. In 2016, the painting underwent renovation in Krakow. On June 3, 2016, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of the miraculous image of Our Lady of ≈Åukawiec fell out. On this occasion a new huge altar was made in the parish church. On June 4, 2016, a miraculous picture was placed in the new altar. The consecration of the new altar was made by Archbishop Mieczys≈Çaw Mokrzycki, who comes from ≈Åukawiec on June 8, 2016 during the main anniversary celebrations. From now on, the picture is solemnly unveiled and shaded by the sound of a fanfare and a song to the Mother of God.

His activities against the Indochina war, caused him to spend a few weeks in prison in 1949, then sixteen months in hiding in 1952‚Äì53. He then resumed his studies, became a professor in 1954, passed the CAPES (diploma in teaching - secondary schools) in history in 1958, his diploma in teaching higher education in 1960 and was appointed lecturer. At the same time, he was responsible for the founding of the Union of Communist Students. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956 and, in 1960‚Äì1961, the \\"Servin-Casanova affair\\" - named after two high-ranking Communist leaders sanctioned for their Khrushchevian theses - shook his convictions. A little marginal in the party, but strongly supported by Roland Leroy,Robrieux, Volume 4, p. 198. Elleinstein used a freedom of tone that brought him closer to the Italian or Spanish communists. Appointed deputy director of the Center for Marxist Studies and Research, between 1972 and 1975 he published a 4-volume history of the Soviet Union (Histoire de l'URSS) in which he diverted substantially from the orthodox version that had been expressed since 1945 by Jean Bruhat. In line with the policy of openness of the time of the Union of the Left and Eurocommunism, his history was authorised by the PCF. Further exploiting his freedom to speake, in 1975 Elleinstein published History of the Stalinist phenomenon in which he analyzes Stalinism as the unfortunate product of historical circumstances. The 22nd French Communist Party Congress in 1976 was marked by an attempted break with the Soviet system spearheaded by . Ellerstein became the non-official spokesman for a communism now redefined to be democratic and revised, with his book, Le PC, (the French Communist Party), and his Open Letter to the French people about a reformed republic based on the Programme commun, Following the failure of the Union of the Left in 1977 and the rapprochement of PCF leader Georges Marchais with Brezhnev, and especially in view of Ellerstein's regular contributions to Figaro Magazine, by the second half of 1980, the conventional wisdom among upper echelons of the PCF was \\"that he had ejected himself from the party\\" and that there was therefore no need to eject him formally.

The first speech is a historical overview in which he provides a moral rationale for the fall of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BC) and the rise of the Western Zhou. Here, the King said that drinking wine in excess has made the Shang dynasty lose the Mandate of Heaven, grace, and the army, while the Kings of Zhou do not drink excessively even ceremonially. The King further commands Yu() to support the King and to work official service throughout days. The second speech is a short charge to Yu to emulate his late grandfather, Nang Gong.

Pan Zuyin was a famous collector with rich knowledge in Chinese characters. In 1890, Pan acquired the Da Ke ding, the second largest bronzeware of the Western Zhou dynasty after the Da Yu ding. His younger brother Pan Zunian (; 1870-1925) inherited the family property. In about 1896, the Pan family moved to Suzhou from Beijing with their collection, including the two tripods. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. Fearing looting or destruction, the Pan family packed the two tripods in a wood box and buried it. In 1951, Pan Dayu (; 1906-2007) donated the two tripods to the Shanghai Museum.Pan Dayu wrote a short letter, intending to donate the two tripods to Shanghai Museum. A few months later, Liu Ruli () and Shen Gengmei () went to Suzhou accompanied by Pan Jiahua (), daughter of Pan Dayu, to take the tripods. Mao Dun (1896‚Äì1981), the Minister of Culture, personally inscribed an honorary credential for her. There, they would be displayed together until 1959, when the Da Yu ding was transferred to the National Museum of China in Beijing. In March 2004, to celebrate Pan Dayu's 100 birthday, the Da Yu ding was transferred to the Shanghai Museum for a limited time display, the first time the tripods were together in nearly 50 years.

B. Elangasinha was born on 6 April 1888 in Illawathura, Gampola and receivied his primary education at the Buddhist Mixed School, Gampola, and St. Thomas College, Mathara. He went to St. Thomas Teachers Training school before being appointed as the headmaster of Waebada Buddhist School.

While the song itself was flawless and above reproach it was the perception of favoritism in the decision to adopt it that fueled criticism and protests.

Company  The company was set-up by a number of local capitalists in the summer of 1895. After a number of surveys the railroad was finally located through private property between these villages, about one-quarter of a mile easterly from the River Road, thus avoiding the destruction of property along the banks of the lower Niagara River, or occupying the highway.Street Railway Review, Vol 7, 1897, p. 299-300. Street Railway Review, Vol 7, 1897, p. 653-654 (Reprint).  Route  The contract for the construction of the roadbed, ballasting, overhead work and fencing was let April 12, 1896, to Craige & Tench, Buffalo, New York, for the sum of $63,500. The railroad started from the New York Central depot at Lewiston and ran up Center street to 5th street. Then it ran northerly through 5th street to the village limits, then through private lands to 3rd street, Youngstown, then through Church street to Main street and to the United States Military Reservation, at the mouth of the Niagara River. There was also a branch in Lewiston from 5th street through Onondaga street to the New York Central freight station and a branch in Youngstown to the docks. The road was long in all. The country through which this road ran is extremely level and is in the heart of the Niagara fruit district, being largely devoted to the culture of apples, peaches and grapes. The right of way is in width and fenced throughout its entire length between the villages. There were no structures whatever on the line, with the exception of a few wooden box culverts and one trestle long and about high.  Track  The road was single track of and had five turnouts in the course of the line with end switches at each end. In the two villages the track was laid with girder rails, of 67-lb/yard (32.5 kg/m) and of 87-lb/yard (43.5 kg/m) and in the country for with 56-lb/yard (27.7kg/m) T-rails. The Johnson Company furnished the rails and track fastenings and all the rails except the 87-lb/yard (43.5 kg/m) girders which were rolled by the Pennsylvania Steel Company. The ties were of cedar, x , spaced between centers. The line was ballasted with broken stone which was deep under the ties.  Electrification  R. W. Oliver furnished the overhead work at a cost of $9,750. In the villages span work was used and in the country side pole bracket work. The trolley wire was No. 00 and there were nearly of No. 0000 stranded triple covered feed wire starting from Lewiston and reaching nearly to Youngstown. All poles and fence posts were painted olive green. No power plant was constructed by this company, because power could be obtained from the plant of the Niagara Falls & Power Company, which was situated away from Lewiston. It was generated by one of the 1.000-h.p. generators situated in the new power house at the foot of the cliff at a voltage of 550 Volts. This was raised to 750 volts by being passed through a booster and was conveyed to Lewiston over a 500,000 circular mil stranded copper wire triple covered. This wire was strung on the poles of the Niagara Gorge Railroad and thus brought to Lewiston, where it was connected with the trolley and feed wire.  Rolling stock  The equipment consisted of four, eight bench open motor cars and two closed combination baggage and passenger cars seating 16 people, made by the J. G. Brill Company, Philadelphia. The combination cars had a vestibule on the passenger end, and the baggage compartment, which was long, had sliding doors on each side and three drop sash in the front end allowing the motorman to occupy the baggage compartment when running that end forward, but there was no vestibule. All these cars are equipped with Brill eureka maximum traction trucks, with diameter wheels. Each truck was equipped with one G.E. 1,000 motor, thus giving each car horizontal tractive pull. The total cost of roadway, equipment, transmission line, land damages, etc., amounted to very nearly $100,000.  Operation  After a number of delays, owing to the non-arrival of material, etc., the road was informally opened the latter part of August, 1896. The company contemplated a freight as well as a passenger service, and was handling about 10 cars of freight per day in 1897, beside package freight. A steady passenger traffic was maintained between the points mentioned, which increased during the summer. When the Niagara Gorge Railroad was taken out of use in 1935, the Lewiston & Youngstown Frontier Electric Railway remained in service as a diesel freight line.

Hedjhotep is sometimes described as a goddess rather than a god, holding a wadj-scepter and ankh sign. He possibly originated from the northern part of Middle Egypt. The earliest attestations of Hedjhotep date back to the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom, when he appears in spells of the Coffin Texts including spells 779 and 908. A cult center of Hedjhotep might have existed at the time east of the Faiyum in el Lahun. It is in nearby Harageh that archaeological excavations unearthed the only stele known to be dedicated explicitly to Hedjhotep, stele AEIN 1540, from the tomb of a man named Nebipu who held the titles of \\"libationer\\" and \\"keeper of clothing\\". The onomastic of individuals who lived in the region of Heracleopolis Magna during the Middle Kingdom indicates that Hedjhotep then benefitted from a growing cult and dedicated priesthood. In spite of this, Hedjhotep does not seem to have been honoured by dedicated priests in subsequent periods of Ancient Egyptian history, during which he appears only sporadically on sarcophagi and liturgical contexts centered on rituals devoted to the king. In parallel with these developments, the New Kingdom sees Hedjhotep being given medicinal roles. He is invoked with Shezmu, the god of the preparation of unguents, in the treatment of headache and stomach-ache, and in the making of amulets where he is in charge of their cords. Another papyrus of the same time period presents Hedjhotep as a dichotomy: beneficial as a god of clothing but harmful as a deity who committed an offence against Montu, possibly running away with one of his divine wives or having forced a sexual relation on him similar to what happens in \\"The Contendings of Horus and Seth\\". From this time onwards, Hedjhotep is often associated with a goddess of weaving named Tayt as well as with Renenutet. Hedjhotep is more frequently honoured during the Late Period, Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman period, when he is shown replacing Horus as the son of Isis in scenes of cloth-offerings. The latest period sees the development of a syncretism with the god Shu, making of Hedjhotep a son of Ra and the first to have dressed the naked, having invented clothing. Hedjhotep nonetheless remains primarily the god who creates the clothes of the king, the gods and the deceased, thereby stimulating their resurrection.

They state to be committed to defend what they call \\"the hispanic identity of Catalonia\\". It was founded between 2011 and November 16, 2013 in Santpedor (Bages), where one of its founders, Josep Ramon Bosch, resides. The organisation is led by Javier Barraycoa. Currently Somatemps has around 300 members. The name of Somatemps was intended as word-play between \\"\\"‚Äî\\"we are in time\\" (to stop independentism)‚Äîand the medieval Catalan militias . Somatemps has contributed to the creation of the association Catalan Civil Society.  History  The first meeting of the entity was attended by both leaders of Platform for Catalonia (PxC) and the Republican Social Movement (MSR) with Juan Antonio Llopart, referents to Spain of parties such as the Greek Golden Dawn or the British National Party (BNP) and fascist movements such as Casa Pound. Somatemps is considered a far-right organization as per police and press sources. Josep Alsina, who succeeded Bosch in Somatemps, when he was young he had been a member of the NSSP, the National Socialist Spanish Party or PENS, Partido Espa√±ol Nacional Socialista in Spanish. PENS is a neo-Nazi organization created in Barcelona in 1970 and that had strong links with the secret services of the Superior Center of Defense Information (SECED), to the point that he could pay a local and print large runs of Nazi propaganda. The PENS came to commit attacks against bookstores, cinemas and theaters or distributors of books and publishing houses. Alsina also relates Jorge Buxad√© Villalba, who has publicly acknowledged being a member of Catalan Civil Society, and who attended the 7th nomination of Falange Espa√±ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (FE de las JONS) for Tarragona in the 1995 Catalan elections. Buxad√© also became a State Attorney in September 2009, under the orders of the Spanish Government, when he challenged the consultation on the independence of Catalonia held in Arenys de Munt. Somatemps also received the help of the lawyer Ariadna Hern√°ndez, at that time coordinating VOX in the demarcation of Barcelona and partner of one of the main drivers of the neofascist Casal Tramuntana, the councilor of PxC in l'Hospitalet de Llobregat Alberto S√°nchez. Journalist Xavier Rius has even come to the point that Catalan Civil Society has had contacts with which he was delegated from the Spanish government in Catalonia, Mar√≠a de los Llanos de Luna, contacts but Bosch denies insistently despite the fact that there are photographs of the meeting. The entity organized in December 2013 in Ripoll the 1st Congress of Spanish Catalanity in which the ex democratic socialist Joaquim Coll (member of Catalan Civil Society) and the People's Party Fernando S√°nchez-Costa participated. He was also organizing protests in front of the Convergence and Union headquarters for the Pujol case, which was joined by Platform for Catalonia (PxC) before Parliament for the same reason. Entities like Spain and Catalans in 2012 and Som Catalunya, Som Espanya in 2013, had wanted to publicly commemorate the Hispanic Day in Barcelona, but they did not manage to concentrate a sufficiently large attendance. Somatemps tried to take over the relief by convening the founding assembly on April 26 at the Poblet Monastery. A few days ago, an event had already been held in Barcelona where the presentation of the Catalan Civil Society was attended by, among others, the extreme right of Santiago Abascal, general secretary of the new Vox and Borja Garc√≠a-Nieto, the president of the Equestrian Circle. Somatemps did not adhere to the rally on October 12 in Barcelona although they were present. In the context of the Spanish constitutional crisis and before the 1-O Catalan independence referendum of 2017, Somatemps participated in the so-called \\"ham operation\\" which sent 25 kg of Iberian ham and boxes of Rioja wine to the Spanish police and Civil Guard agents summoned in Barcelona by the Spanish government. The agents were allocated in hotels and ships docked in Barcelona's seaport. Somatemps organized a donation campaign which obtained around 2.500 euros of funds for the symbolic operation. Other actions in which Somatemps has participated involved bringing food to the policemen. On November 18, 2017 Somatemps participated in a far-right demonstration supporting the Spanish unionism. This demonstration opposed a demonstration call made by Unit Against Fascism and Racism.  Political Agenda  This organisation is of Spanish Nationalist nature. They believe that a constitution is irrelevant for Spain, and despise the concepts of freedom and social equality expressed in the current constitution. They promote a Spain formed by a single political nation, alluding to what they believe was the old Spanish Empire. By proposing a single political nation, they deny the existence of national and regional identities in Spain and their corresponding political movements. This means they pursue some sort of imperialism with a single political nation ruling over the rest. In consequence, they are positioned against Catalan Nationalism. Catalan education system which makes extensive use of Catalan as tuition language is also against Somatemps doctrine. Somatemps claims that pupils in Catalonia are indoctrinated into Catalan nationalism, something which multiple studies have refuted, identifying as main factors parental and neighbourhood influence. Other points which Somatemps defend to support Spanish Nationalism is to point out a supposed Catalan history revisionism. Somatemps opposes to policies and campaigns aiding immigrants, including those from Red Cross and Plataforma per la Llengua which promote the learning of Catalan language among immigrants with the purpose of improving equality of opportunities. Somatemps supports political catholicism, positioning the Catholic Church as a part of their view of a Spanish nation. LGBT campaigns are belittled as an offence to their religious sentiments. In their blog they have criticised the pride parade for indecency, published texts deeming laws which protect the LGBT group as unnecessary and indoctrinating, and texts against same-sex marriage and abortion.

On 23 November 1733, hearing the signal of a cannon fired from Fort Fredericksvaern, Breffu entered the main house and killed both Kr√∏yer and his wife. Taking all gunpowder and ammunition, and accompanied by fellow slave Christian, Breffu then proceeded to the Van Stell family house, where she killed three members of the plantation owner's family.

Founded by Fredrik Axelsson in 1999, the company is famous for its extensive line of competition and hunting pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) rifles. FX Airguns is known in the industry for its proprietary \\"Smooth Twist\\" barrels, which uses hybrid riflings with a long smoothbore portion and press- forged slow-twist riflings near the muzzle. FX later introduced the \\"Smooth Twist X\\" barrels in 2017, which allow the user to easily switch barrels of different calibers and a different twist rates. FX air rifles are also known for innovative features such as the interchangeable air tubes and the power adjuster wheel, as well as the ability to shoot arrows in some models. The company is one of the first manufacturers to produce modular airguns.  History  Fredrik Axelsson had been an avid airgun enthusiast since he started shooting since 5 years of age. At the end of 1989, he started making things for airguns after being disappointed by an English-made .22 caliber spring-piston air rifle he purchased for shooting pigeons in a tree, with which he had done very little actual shooting because the spring broke after a couple of months. As a result, Axelsson made his own gas ram, but he didn't like the recoil despite it worked quite well. He then started experimenting and making other kinds of airguns, including a 9mm CO2 rifle and a 20-gauge air shotgun with replaceable chokes. After experimenting with pump pneumatic rifles, Axelsson then moved to develop PCP rifles. In 1994, Axelsson came up with the original design for the Independence rifle. As there wasn't a lot of SCUBA diving activities in Sweden, one of the problems needed to be addressed was the difficulty finding gas cylinders to recharge the rifles. Axelsson developed with a three-stage hand pump that alleviated this difficulty of refilling PCP airguns. In 1995, he took the ideas to a local company and started production of the hand pump. He then took the pump off the Independence rifle and sold it to Webley & Scott, which later became the Webley Axsor rifle. Around the same time, he also made the Timberwolf rifle. Axelsson's partnership with that company ended in May 1999, when he resigned without taking any of his patents and went on to create FX Airguns, his own company. After Webley & Scott agreed to a manufacturing contract on the condition that any new products FX developed must fit into the Axsor stocks, Axelsson made the FX2000. In 2000, Axelsson came up with a patent on a new pump and an electrical air compressor, followed by the Cyclone rifle in 2001. In 2001, Axelsson considered entering the American market, as the American regulations for airguns are less restrictive and there was already a sizeable enthusiast population in North America. He contacted American airgun collector Ingvar Alm for advice, who recommended the retailer Airguns of Arizona. AOA's president Robert Buchanan agreed to have samples of the FX2000 and the Excalibur rifles, and was very impressed by the rifle's accuracy and light weight (due to Axelsson's design of light hammers striking small valves). Axelsson was also unhappy with his Italian supplier of stocks at the time, so FX started to build their own machines that would make the synthetic stocks they wanted. FX's venture into the North American markets has been a great success, and in 2009 Axelsson decided to shift the company's main focus to America due to the commercial freedom and more innovation-friendly consumer mindset compared to markets in Europe. In 2005, after having some issues with barrels supplied by other contractors, Axelsson decided that the company need to make their own barrels, and started developing a smoothbore-rifled bore combination design, which later became the company's proprietary \\"Smooth Twist\\" rifling. After showing his project to British airgun specialist Ben Taylor in 2007, Taylor gave him Axelsson the idea of making the rifling by impressing the barrel from the outside, which allowed FX to make quality barrels fast. In 2012, Axelsson used the FX Boss air rifle to win the annual Extreme Benchrest competition (sponsored by Airguns of Arizona) held at Green Valley, Arizona, where 4 others out of the top 10 competitors also used FX air rifles. Since then, FX air rifles have become increasingly popular among competition shooters, with nearly 3/4 of the top 20 Extreme Benchrest competitors in both \\"Pro\\" and \\"Sportsman\\" classes using FX airguns in 2017.

Taxonomy The species was first described by Bunz≈ç Hayata in 1916 as Gymnadenia tominagae. Hayata stated that the plant he described was collected by T. Tominaga. He spelt the specific epithet as \\"tominagai\\", and this spelling has been used by some subsequent authors when transferring the species to a different genus. However, the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants requires names not published in a form specified by the code to be corrected to conform to it, and personal names ending in \\"-a\\", even if the person is a man, should have an epithet in the genitive case formed by adding \\"-e\\". The epithet is thus correctly spelt \\"tominagae\\". The species has been transferred to several genera: to Amitostigma (now included in Ponerorchis), to Orchis, and in 2000, to Ponerorchis.

The voluntary organisation provides over 90% of the emergency services in the impassable terrain of the German Central Upland and Alpine regions. By contrast the Austrian Berg- und Naturwachten √ñsterreichs purely looks after nature conservation and the environment leaving Alpine rescue in the hands of the Austrian Mountain Rescue Service (√ñsterreichischer Bergrettungsdienst).  Objectives  The objectives of the Bergwacht are multi-faceted: Save life: * Rescue (and recovery of those fatally injured) from alpine and impassable terrain * rescue from heights * Medical treatment of casualties * Searching for missing persons (see also Search and Rescue) * Rescue from avalanches, gorges and caves * Care and support of relatives (including the mountain crisis intervention service (KID Berg)) * Support for the DRK in overseas operations * Support of the ground-based emergency medical services and Emergency management Nature conservation: * Management of nature reserves and nature reserve projects * Support to the Naturschutzwacht and the Naturschutzbeir√§te * Support of the required nature reserve projects (e. g. wild animals and skiing in the mountains) * Public and youth work in the conservation of nature and the environment (e. g. nature youth camps)  History  The first German mountain rescue service existed in Saxony as early as 1912. It consisted of the Samaritan department of the Saxon Mountaineering Association. In 1920, Munich men founded a German mountain rescue service with the aim of restoring order, custom and decency in the mountains. The rather desolate conditions in the mountains after the First World War, with poaching, theft of huts, cattle and wood, prompted the founders to join forces to \\"protect the mountain from the people\\". A short time later, the Red Cross founded the Mountain Accident Service (GUD), an association of Red Cross paramedics. By 1923, the mountain rescue service, or Bergwacht, already comprised three departments, Munich, Allg√§u and Chiemgau. The Bergwacht was entrusted with the task of providing \\"on the spot help for alpine rescue services\\". With the annexation of Austria in 1938, the Austrian rescue organisations also merged into the German Bergwacht. In 1939, the Bergwacht was also entrusted with nature conservation. In the further course of the Second World War the mountain rescue men were sworn in as auxiliary policemen. In 1944, the Bergwacht was placed under military authority. After the end of the Second World War, the Bergwacht was disbanded in the US occupation zone. The departments joined the respective regional associations of the German Red Cross. In the French occupation zone, the authorities approved the establishment of the independent Black Forest Bergwacht. In 1955, the Bergwacht state associations joined forces at federal level to form a working group. From this the Federal Committee for Mountain Rescue of the German Red Cross (DRK) emerged. The Black Forest Bergwacht was represented on this committee as a corporate member. Today the mountain rescue service is a member of the International Commission for Alpine Mountain Rescue or IKAR.  Organisation and state associations  The organisation of the Bergwacht is aligned to that of the German Red Cross. For example, the Bergwacht operates as part of the eleven DRK state associations. The Black Forest Mountain Rescue Service (Bergwacht Schwarzwald or BWS) has a special status. The BWS is a corporate member of the DRK State Association of the Baden Red Cross and at the same time an independent association and looks after mountain rescue on the territory of the Baden Red Cross (Black Forest).

Background  After the failed offensive of the previous year, Soviets restrained for a further campaign until Finland signed the Moscow Armistice on 9 September 1944, ceasing war with Soviet Union and starting hostilities with Germany (Lapland War). This move, enabled the Soviet Navy to avoid the mine field barrages in the Gulf of Finland that caused heavy losses in 1942 and prevented success in 1943.

As a two-year-old in 1926 she showed steady improvement, winning two of her i races including the valuable Imperial Produce Stakes. On her three-year-old debut she recorded a very impressive win in the 1000 Guineas but failed to reproduce her form in two subsequent races over longer distances. She had little immediate success as a broodmare but had a long-term influence on the breed though her daughter Gold Race. Background Cresta Run was a bay mare bred and owned by Giles Loder who owned the Eyresfield Stud in County Kildare. Throughout her racing career she was trained by Peter Gilpin at his Clarehaven Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was described as a \\"charming filly\\" with \\"well-developed quarters\\" and an \\"intelligent head\\". She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making her a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Hurry On sired numerous other major winners including Captain Cuttle, Coronach, Call Boy, Pennycomequick and Precipitation. Cresta Run's dam Bridgemount also produced Foxbridge who was exported to New Zealand where he sired Hi Jinx and Foxzami. Racing career =1926: two-year-old season= Cresta Run began her racing career by finishing unplaced behind Book Law in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. She was also unplaced in the National Breeders' Produce Stakes and then ran third in the Prince of Wales's Plate before recording her first success in the Highclere Nursery Handicap at Newbury Racecourse. On 8 October Cresta Run carried 127 pounds in the ¬£3,797 Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse and won by three lengths from eleven opponents in a time of 1:13.00. At Newmarket Racecourse in later that month she was matched against male opposition in the Middle Park Stakes but finished uplaced behind the colt Call Boy. Cresta Run ended the season with earnings of ¬£4,880. =1927: three- year-old season= The 114th running of 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile on 29 April attracted a field of twenty-eight runners and Cresta Run, ridden by Arthur Balding, started at odds of 10/1. She appeared somewhat nervous and agitated in the paddock before the race but started well and immediately assumed the lead. She was never seriously challenged and won the race with \\"ridiculous ease\\" by two lengths from Book Law and Endowment, who dead-heated for second place. Her winning time of 1:38.0 was 0.2 seconds faster than that recorded by Adam's Apple in the 2000 Guineas over the same course. In the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse Cresta Run started 3/1 second favourite behind Book Law. The large, noisy crowd, high temperatures and three false starts led her to become to become very upset and after being left behind the other fillies at the start she finished last of the sixteen runners in a race won by Beam. Later that summer she was beaten by Cinq a Sept in the Irish Oaks. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cresta Run an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record Cresta Run was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Gold Race had little success as a racehorse but had considerable influence as a broodmare, with her female-line descendants including Jupiter Island, Precocious and Grand Lodge. *Gold Race, a brown filly, foaled in 1930, sired by Colorado *Breadcrust, a bay colt sired by Manna *Unnamed chestnut gelding sired by Apelle (called Cresta Run gelding) Pedigree References Category:1924 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 14-b Category:1000 Guineas winners Category:Godolphin Arabian sire line ","title":"Cresta Run (horse)"},{"id":"56992626","text":"Gu Ti ( third century), courtesy name Zitong, was an official of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period of China.

When Sun Quan, the founding emperor of Eastern Wu, was in his twilight years, a power struggle broke out between his sons Sun He and Sun Ba over the succession to their father's throne. The cause of the conflict was Sun Quan's failure to make a clear distinction between the statuses of the two princes. Although he already designated Sun He as the crown prince, he favoured Sun Ba and treated him exceptionally well. Gu Ti, along with the general Zhu Ju, often urged Sun Quan to follow Confucian rules of propriety and ensure that Sun He, as the legitimate heir apparent, received greater honours and privileges as compared to Sun Ba. They spoke in a very sincere and candid manner. Their colleagues in the imperial court were rather taken aback by their response.(Ê¨äÊú´Âπ¥ÔºåÂ´°Â∫∂‰∏çÂàÜÔºåÊÇåÊï∏ËàáÈ©ÉÈ®éÂ∞áËªçÊú±ÊìöÂÖ±Èô≥Á¶çÁ¶èÔºåË®ÄËæ≠ÂàáÁõ¥ÔºåÊúùÂª∑ÊÜö‰πã„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 52.

The portion of the coupling shown at the right in the cut was shrunk into that half of the axle. The collar at the extreme end of the coned portion of the axle was also shrunk on. A long conical bearing with adjustable brasses was provided as shown. The joints of the coupling were tight so that it could be filled with oil. With this axle little trouble was experienced from the sharp curves.John H. White: The American Railroad Passenger Car, Part 2. JHU Press, 1985. p. 524.

Roosevelt was wary of the Supreme Court early in his first term, and his administration was slow to bring constitutional challenges of New Deal legislation before the court.Leuchtenburg, at 84. However, early wins for New Deal supporters came in Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell and Nebbia v. New York at the start of 1934. At issue in each case were state laws relating to economic regulation. Blaisdell concerned the temporary suspension of creditor's remedies by Minnesota in order to combat mortgage foreclosures, finding that temporal relief did not, in fact, impair the obligation of a contract. Nebbia held that New York could implement price controls on milk, in accordance with the state's police power. While not tests of New Deal legislation themselves, the cases gave cause for relief of administration concerns about Associate Justice Owen Roberts, who voted with the majority in both cases.Leuchtenburg, at 26. Roberts's opinion for the court in Nebbia was also encouraging for the administration: Nebbia also holds a particular significance: it was the one case in which the Court abandoned its jurisprudential distinction between the \\"public\\" and \\"private\\" spheres of economic activity, an essential distinction in the court's analysis of state police power.White, at 203‚Äì04. The effect of this decision radiated outward, affecting other doctrinal methods of analysis in wage regulation, labor, and the power of the U.S. Congress to regulate commerce.Cushman, at 5‚Äì7. Just three weeks after its defeat in the railroad pension case, the Roosevelt administration suffered its most severe setback, on May 27, 1935: \\"Black Monday\\".McKenna, at 96‚Äì103. Chief Justice Hughes arranged for the decisions announced from the bench that day to be read in order of increasing importance. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Roosevelt in three cases: With several cases laying forth the criteria necessary to respect the due process and property rights of individuals, and statements of what constituted an appropriate delegation of legislative powers to the President, Congress quickly revised the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA).Urofsky, at 681‚Äì83. However, New Deal supporters still wondered how the AAA would fare against Chief Justice Hughes's restrictive view of the Commerce Clause from the Schechter decision. On what became known as White Monday, on March 29, 1937, the court handed down three decisions upholding New Deal legislation, two of them unanimous: West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, Wright v. Vinton Branch, and Virginia Railway v. Federation.McKenna, at 420‚Äì22. The Wright case upheld a new Frazier-Lemke Act which had been redrafted to meet the Court's objections in the Radford case; similarly, Virginia Railway case upheld labor regulations for the railroad industry, and is particularly notable for its foreshadowing of how the Wagner Act cases would be decided as the National Labor Relations Board was modeled on the Railway Labor Act contested in the case.  Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan  The first major test of New Deal legislation came in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, announced January 7, 1935. Contested in this case was the National Industrial Recovery Act, Section 9(c), in which Congress had delegated to the President authority \\"to prohibit the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum ... produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted ... by any State law\\". The NIRA passed in June 1933, and Roosevelt moved quickly to file executive orders to regulate the oil industry. Two small, independent oil producers, Panama Refining Co. and Amazon Petroleum Co. filed suit seeking an injunction to halt enforcement, arguing that the law exceeded Congress's interstate commerce power and improperly delegated authority to the President. The Supreme Court, by an 8-1 margin, agreed with the oil companies, finding that Congress had inappropriately delegated its regulatory power without both a clear statement of policy and the establishment of a specific set of standards by which the President was empowered to act. Although a loss for the Roosevelt administration and New Deal supporters, it was mitigated by the narrowness of the court's opinion, which did not deny Congress's authority to regulate interstate oil commerce.Urofsky, at 676‚Äì78. Chief Justice Hughes, who wrote the majority opinion, indicated that the policy which Section 9(c) enacted was not unconstitutional and that it was only ruled unconstitutional because it was poorly worded and did not convey specific powers. The Court's opinion indicated that Congress could resolve the unconstitutional provisions of the Act by simply adding procedural safeguards, hence the Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935 was passed into law.  Gold Clause Cases  Economic regulation again appeared before the Supreme Court in the Gold Clause Cases.Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., ; Nortz v. United States, ; Perry v. United States, . In his first week after taking office, Roosevelt closed the nation's banks, acting from fears that gold hoarding and international speculation posed a danger to the national monetary system. He based his actions on the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Congress quickly ratified Roosevelt's action with the Emergency Banking Act. A month later, the President issued Executive Order 6102, confiscating all gold coins, bullion, and certificates, requiring they be surrendered to the government by May 1, 1933 in exchange for currency. Congress also passed a joint resolution cancelling all gold clauses in public and private contracts, stating such clauses interfered with its power to regulate U.S. currency. While the Roosevelt administration waited for the court to return its judgment, contingency plans were made for an unfavorable ruling.McKenna, at 56‚Äì66. Ideas circulated within the White House to narrowly exercise the government's power of sovereign immunity by withdrawing the right to sue the government to enforce gold clauses. Attorney General Cummings suggested the court should be immediately packed to ensure a favorable ruling. Roosevelt himself ordered the Treasury to manipulate the market to give the impression of turmoil, although Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau refused. Roosevelt also drew up executive orders to close all stock exchanges and prepared a radio address to the public. On February 18, 1935, the Justices' decisions in all three cases were announced; all supported the government's position by a narrow 5‚Äì4 majority. Chief Justice Hughes wrote the opinion for each case, finding the government had plenary power to regulate money. As such, the abrogation of both private and public contractual gold clauses was within congressional reach when such clauses represented a threat to Congress's control of the monetary system. Speaking for the Court in the Perry case, Hughes's opinion was remarkable: in a judicial tongue-lashing not seen since Marbury v. Madison, Hughes chided Congress for an act which, while legal, was regarded as clearly immoral. However, Hughes ultimately found the plaintiff had no cause of action, and thus no standing to sue the government.  Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.  While not itself a part of the New Deal, the Roosevelt administration kept a close eye on the challenge to the 1934 Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.. Its similarity with the Social Security Act meant the test of the railroad pension regime would serve as an indicator of whether Roosevelt's ambitious retirement program would be found constitutional.Leuchtenburg, at 27‚Äì39. The railroad pension was designed to encourage older rail workers to retire, thereby creating jobs for younger railroaders desperately in need of work, although ostensibly Congress passed the act on the grounds that it would increase safety on the country's railways. Numerous challenges to the law were filed in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and injunctions were issued on the grounds that the law was an unconstitutional regulation of an activity not connected to interstate commerce. The Supreme Court took the case without waiting for an appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.McKenna, at 66‚Äì73. On May 6, 1935, Justice Roberts's 5‚Äì4 opinion for the Court rejected the government's position, dismissing the purported effect on railway safety as \\"without support in reason or common sense\\". Further, Roberts took issue with a provision of the act which awarded pension computation credit to former rail workers, regardless of when they had last worked in the industry. Roberts characterized the provision as \\"a naked appropriation of private property\\" ‚Äî taking the belongings \\"of one and bestowing it upon another\\" ‚Äî and a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Black Monday  = Humphrey's Executor v. United States = The first of three cases on Black Monday read out was Humphrey's Executor v. United States. After taking office, President Roosevelt came to believe that William Humphrey, a Republican appointed to a six-year term on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1931, was at odds with the administration's New Deal initiatives. Writing to request Humphrey's resignation from the FTC in August 1933, Roosevelt openly admitted his reason for seeking his removal: \\"I did not feel that your mind and my mind go along together.\\"Leuchtenburg, at 60. This proved to be a blunder on Roosevelt's part. When Humphrey could not be persuaded to resign, Roosevelt dismissed him from office on October 7.Leuchtenburg, at 61‚Äì62. Humphrey promptly filed suit to return to his appointed office and to collect backpay. The basis for his suit was the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act, which specified that the President was only authorized to remove a FTC commissioner \\"for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\\".Leuchtenburg, at 69. Humphrey died on February 14, 1934 and his suit was carried on by his wife ‚Äî as executor of his estate ‚Äî for backpay up to the date of his death (with interest). Associate Justice George Sutherland read the court's opinion, holding that Roosevelt had indeed acted outside of his authority when he fired Humphrey from the FTC, stating that Congress had intended regulatory commissions such as the FTC to be independent of executive influence.Urofsky, at 678‚Äì81. = Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford = Next announced was Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford. The 1934 Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act was designed to give aid to debt-ridden farmers, allowing them to reacquire farms they had lost from foreclosure, or to petition the Bankruptcy Court within their district to suspend foreclosure proceedings.McKenna, at 100‚Äì01. The legislation's ultimate goal was to help those farmers scale down their mortgages. The opinion of the court, read by Justice Louis Brandeis, struck down the act on Fifth Amendment Takings Clause grounds. The court found the act stripped the creditor of property which was held before the passage of the act, without any form of compensation, and bestowed the property upon the debtor. Further, the act allowed the debtor to remain on the mortgaged property for up to five years after declaring bankruptcy, giving the creditor no opportunity to foreclose immediately. While the states could not impair contract obligations, the federal government could‚Äîbut it could not take property in such a manner without compensating the creditor. = Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States = The final blow for the President on Black Monday fell with the reading of Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, which revisited the National Industrial Recovery Act, invalidating the NIRA in its entirety. Under Section 3 of the NIRA, the President had promulgated the Live Poultry Code to regulate the New York poultry market. The Schechter brothers had been charged with criminal violations of the code and were convicted, whereupon they appealed on grounds that the NIRA was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive, the NIRA sought to regulate business which was not engaged in interstate commerce, and that certain sections violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the unanimous court, holding that Congress had delegated too much lawmaking authority to the President without any clear guidelines or standards.White, at 111‚Äì14. Section 3 granted either trade associations or the President authority to draft \\"codes of fair competition\\", which amounted to a capitulation of congressional legislative authority. The arrangement presented the danger that private entities, and not government officials, could engage in creating codes of law enforceable upon the public. Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who had been the lone dissent in the similar Panama case, agreed with the majority. In his concurring opinion, Cardozo described Section 3 as \\"delegation run riot\\". Hughes also renewed an old method of jurisprudence concerning the \\"current of commerce\\" theory of the Commerce Clause as expounded by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Swift v. United States.Urofsky, at 679. Hughes determined the poultry at issue in the case, though purchased for slaughter interstate, were not intended for any further interstate transactions after Schecter slaughtered them. Thus, the poultry were outside of Congress's authoritative reach unless Schechter's business had a direct and logical connection to interstate commerce, per the Shreveport Rate Case. Hughes used a direct/indirect effect analysis to determine the Schechters' business was not within the reach of congressional regulation. = Roosevelt reacts = Upon learning of the unanimity of the three court decisions, Roosevelt became distressed and irritable, regarding the opinions as personal attacks.McKenna, at 104‚Äì05. The Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey's Ex. particularly stunned the administration.Leuchtenburg, at 78‚Äì81. Only nine years earlier, in Myers v. United States, the Taft Court had held the President's power to remove executive officials was plenary. Roosevelt and his entourage viewed Sutherland's particularly vicious criticism as an attempt to publicly shame the President and paint him as having purposefully violated the Constitution. After the decisions came down, Roosevelt remarked at a May 31 press conference that the Schechter decision had \\"relegated [the nation] to a horse and buggy definition of interstate commerce\\".McKenna, at 113. The comment lit a fire under the media and indignated the public.McKenna, at 114‚Äì15. Scorned for the perceived attack on the court, Roosevelt assumed a diplomatic silence toward the court and waited for a better opportunity to press his cause with the public.  United States v. Butler  The Agricultural Adjustment Act received its trial in the case of United States v. Butler, announced January 6, 1936. The AAA had created an agricultural regulatory program with a supporting processing tax; the revenue raised was then specifically used to pay farmers to reduce their acreage and production, which would in turn reduce surplus harvest yields and increase prices. Officials of the Hoosac Mills Corp. argued that the AAA was as unconstitutional as the National Industrial Recovery Act, attempting to regulate activity not in interstate commerce. Specifically attacked was the use of Congress's Taxing and Spending power undergirding the program. On January 6, 1936, the Supreme Court ruled the AAA unconstitutional by a 6-3 margin. Associate Justice Roberts again delivered the opinion of a divided court, agreeing with those challenging the tax. Regarding agriculture as an essentially local activity, the court invalidated the AAA as a violation of the powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment. The court also used the occasion to settle a dispute over the General Welfare Clause stemming back to the administration of George Washington, holding Congress possessed a power to tax and spend for the general welfare.  Carter v. Carter Coal Co.  Following the undoing of the National Recovery Administration by the Schechter decision, Congress attempted to salvage the coal industry code promulgated under the National Industrial Recovery Act in the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935.Urofsky, at 683‚Äì84. The act, closely following the criteria of the Schechter ruling, declared a public interest in coal production and found it so integrated into interstate commerce as to warrant federal regulation. The code subjected the coal industry to labor, price, and practice regulations, levying a 15 percent tax on all producers with a provision to refund a significant portion of the tax for those adhering to the legislation's dictates.McKenna, at 197‚Äì98. James Carter, shareholder and president of the Carter Coal Co., filed suit against the board of directors when they voted to pay the tax.McKenna, at 202‚Äì03. On May 18, 1936, the Supreme Court ruled the act unconstitutional by a 5-4 margin. Associate Justice Sutherland read the Carter v. Carter Coal Company opinion, striking down the coal act in its entirety, citing the Schechter decision. Most surprising in the opinion was reliance on 19th-century cases legal scholars had thought long repudiated: Kidd v. Pearson and United States v. E. C. Knight Co.  Ashton v. Cameron County Water Improvement Dist. No. 1  On May 25, 1936, the Supreme Court ruled the 1934 Municipal Bankruptcy Act (also known as the Sumners-Wilcox Bill) was unconstitutional in a 5-4 decision. The law amended the Federal Bankruptcy Act and permitted any municipality or other political subdivision of any state to obtain a voluntary readjustment of its debts through proceedings in Federal Court. Texas' Cameron County Water Improvement Dist. No. 1, which claimed to be insolvent and unable to meets its debts in the long run, petitioned the local Federal District Court for readjustments granted under the Municipal Bankruptcy Act. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which found that the law violated Tenth Amendment rights of state sovereignty.  Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo  The final provocation for New Deal supporters came in the overturning of a New York minimum wage statute on June 1, 1936. Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo was an important attempt among New Deal supporters to overturn a prior Supreme Court decision prohibiting wage price controls, Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Felix Frankfurter, who had led the earlier unsuccessful arguments before the Supreme Court, worked carefully to craft the law for the New York legislature so it would stand up to challenges based upon the Adkins opinion. The case resulted from the indictment of a Brooklyn laundry owner John Tipaldo, who not only had failed to pay his female employees the required minimum salary ($12.40 per week), but had further hidden his transgression by falsifying his books.McKenna, at 209‚Äì13, 408‚Äì12. Tipaldo contested the law under which he was charged as unconstitutional and filed for habeas corpus relief. The New York Court of Appeals found itself in agreement with Tipaldo, being unable to find any substantial difference between the New York law and the Washington, D.C. law overturned in Adkins. How the court split its vote in this case is supportive of challenges to the \\"switch in time\\" narrative. Justices Brandeis, Stone, and Cardozo each thought Adkins was incorrectly decided and wanted to overturn it. Chief Justice Hughes believed the New York law differed from the law in Adkins and wanted to uphold the New York statute. Justices Van Devanter, McReynolds, Sutherland, and Butler found no distinctions and voted to uphold the habeas corpus petition.White, 220-222. The outcome of the Tipaldo case thus hung in the balance of Justice Roberts's vote. Roberts could find no distinction in the two minimum wage laws, but appears to have been inclined to support an overturning of Adkins anyway.Urofsky, at 694. However, Roberts believed the appellant had not taken issue with the Adkins precedent and failed to challenge it.Cushman, at 92‚Äì104. Having no \\"case or controversy\\" legs upon which to stand, Roberts deferred to the Adkins precedent. Roosevelt broke his year-long silence on Supreme Court issues to comment on the Tipaldo opinion:  West Coast Hotel v. Parrish  The decision in the Parrish case received the most attention, and later became an integral part of the \\"switch in time\\" narrative of conventional history. In the case, the court divided along the same lines it had in the Tipaldo case, only this time around Roberts voted to overrule the Adkins precedent as the case brief specifically asked the court to reconsider its prior decision. Further, the decision worked to hinder Roosevelt's push for the court reform bill, further reducing what little public support there was for change in the Supreme Court. Roberts had voted to grant certiorari to hear the Parrish case before the election of 1936.McKenna, at 412-13. Oral arguments occurred on December 16 and 17, 1936, with counsel for Parrish specifically asking the court to reconsider its decision in Adkins v. Children's Hospital, which had been the basis for striking down a New York minimum wage law in Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo in the late spring of 1936.McKenna, at 413. Roberts, however, indicated his desire to overturn Adkins immediately after oral arguments on December 17, 1936. The initial conference vote on December 19, 1936 was split 4‚Äì4; with this even division on the Court, the holding of the Washington Supreme Court, finding the minimum wage statute constitutional, would stand.McKenna, at 414. The eight voting justices anticipated Justice Stone‚Äîabsent due to illness‚Äîwould be the fifth vote necessary for a majority opinion affirming the constitutionality of the minimum wage law. As Chief Justice Hughes desired a clear and strong 5‚Äì4 affirmation of the Washington Supreme Court's judgment, rather than a 4‚Äì4 default affirmation, he convinced the other justices to wait until Stone's return before both deciding and announcing the case. President Roosevelt announced his court reform bill on February 5, 1937, the day of the first conference vote after Stone's February 1, 1937, return to the bench. Roosevelt later made his justifications for the bill to the public on March 9, 1937, during his 9th Fireside Chat. The Court's opinion in Parrish was not published until March 29, 1937, after Roosevelt's radio address. Chief Justice Hughes wrote in his autobiographical notes that Roosevelt's court reform proposal \\"had not the slightest effect on our [the court's] decision\\", but due to the delayed announcement of its decision, the Court was characterized as retreating under fire.McKenna, at 419. Roosevelt also believed that because of the overwhelming support that had been shown for the New Deal in his re-election, Hughes was able to persuade Roberts to no longer base his votes on his own political beliefs and side with him during future votes on New Deal-related policies. In one of his notes from 1936, Hughes wrote that Roosevelt's re-election forced the court to depart from \\"its fortress in public opinion\\" and severely weakened its capability to base its rulings on personal or political beliefs. Shortly after leaving the Court, Roberts reportedly burned all of his legal and judicial papers. As a result, there is no significant collection of Roberts' manuscript papers, as there is for most other modern Justices. Roberts did prepare a short memorandum discussing his alleged change of stance around the time of the court-packing effort, which he left in the hands of Justice Felix Frankfurter.
