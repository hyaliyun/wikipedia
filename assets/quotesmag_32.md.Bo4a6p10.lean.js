The episode, written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Craig Zisk, originally aired on January 16, 2013. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). In the episode, Kit (Evan Peters) must deal with both Alma (Britne Oldford) and Grace (Lizzie Brocher√©) at home. Sister Jude (Jessica Lange), now known as \\"Betty Drake\\", slips further into insanity at the asylum. Lana (Sarah Paulson) publishes a book about her ordeal, even though it may not all be true. Johnny (Dylan McDermott) seeks out a copy of the book to continue his father's \\"work\\". Plot Kit is living with both Alma and Grace (though polygamy is illegal) and his two children, one from each wife. Kit tries to comfort Alma's fear that the aliens might return, while Grace would welcome such an event. As Kit and Grace discuss this, Alma abruptly kills Grace with an axe, stating she had to stop her. At the asylum, Judy is now known as \\"Betty Drake\\" to hide her identity and faked death. Monsignor Timothy Howard tells her that he is leaving to be Cardinal of New York and that the asylum has been donated to the state, and promises Jude he will get her out. Inmates from the local prison overflow will now be brought into the asylum. Jude hallucinates her roommate is Shachath, until she sees Dr. Miranda Crump, the asylum administrator. Crump tells Jude that she has gone through five different roommates in two months. Crump also informs her that it has been two years since Timothy left, having reneged on his promise, and that Pepper died in 1966. Lana publishes Maniac, One woman's story of survival, a best-selling book about the events that happened to her. What she has written contains fabricated events, however, and at a reading she is haunted by visions of Thredson and Wendy, who confront her about her lies. Kit arrives to complain that she has failed to get Briarcliff shut down. He informs her that Alma had been admitted there, but has died. Kit tells her that Judy is still alive, as he has spoken to her, although she is becoming insane. He hopes the news about Judy will reinvigorate Lana's desire to shut down Briarcliff, but she claims Judy has brought her current situation on to herself. In the 2010s, Johnny gets an autographed copy of Maniac, telling the bookstore owner his plans for Lana, his mother: he will take the book, track her down, make her realize that he is her son, proving to her that he is alive, and then kill her, thus completing his father, Oliver Thredson's work. Production \\"Continuum\\" is written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Craig Zisk. In a January 2013 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy spoke about formatting the three leads' stories for the episode, \\"I think we just wanted to spend our time with resolving a lot of those stories. I think it was interesting because a lot of those people had never been together. We've never had Alma and Grace and Kit all together. I think the idea was just to spend a good chunk of time with them and see what that relationship was like which was very interesting with all the progressive, free-love, civil rights stuff so that was one thing.\\" He continued, \\"I love the idea of showing Jude's descent. We wrote it and directed and shot it much like one of those '1950s ladies in prison' movies which I was always obsessed with. As a child I was obsessed with this movie called Caged which was like tough broads standing against James Cagney. I was really thrilled with Frances Conroy's brilliant lady gangster interpretation. She was so brilliant and I loved her henchwoman and I loved the whole idea that Jude thought that woman is death. And I love the actress who plays the new ward of Briarcliff, Robin Bartlett, who's in one of my favorite Mike Nichols movies Heartburn.\\" Finally, he added, \\"All of that Lana stuff was really modeled after Truman Capote and his complete In Cold Blood fame grab. Lana has sorta become Truman Capote meets Jacqueline Susann. I thought it was just fascinating and moving and totally understandable that after all the horrors Lana took refuge and solace in fame and money and celebrity and glamour. I really understood that for her. Then I love how they all dovetailed.\\" Featured media in episode: * President Lyndon B. Johnson's televised announcement of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination * Televised episode of The Flying Nun Reception \\"Continuum\\" was watched by 2.30 million viewers and received an adult 18-49 rating of 1.3, slightly lower than the previously aired episode. Rotten Tomatoes reports a 69% approval rating, based on 16 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"Penultimate episode \\"Continuum\\" forces wrap-ups of too many open-ended arcs, though it still manages to entertain by throwing more wrenches into the mix.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club thought the episode \\"embrace[d] all that's wondrous and all that's awful about this season of American Horror Story, occasionally within the same scene or line of dialogue.\\" She added, \\"This is a horribly messy piece of work that somehow gets to the heart of madness, and it's occasionally a starkly beautiful piece about survivor's guilt.\\" About the episode, Matt Fowler of IGN stated, \\"Not that anything was overtly awful, but the pacing was such that you could just never get a hold on what was going on.\\" He added, \\"I also don't want to fully penalize a show for pulling out all the stops and taking me on a completely unexpected journey.\\" Notes * James Cagney was not in Caged. * Robin Bartlett was in Nichols' Postcards from the Edge, not Heartburn.

The role in the 1865 version is a nasty vocal hybrid, but she does beautifully with the later style, sounding quite suitably apprehensive at the start of 'La luce langue,' as the plot spins. Elsewhere, in the earlier style, and almost alone among sopranos, she observes the staccato markings in 'Or tutti sorgete' and has thought about why Verdi might have written them. (She makes them into a cackle of incipient delight.)

There are more than 10 anticancer conjugates in clinical development. Polymer-drug conjugates are drug molecules held in polymer molecules, which act as the delivery system for the drug. Polymer drugs have passed multidrug resistance (MDR) testing and hence may become a viable treatment for endocrine-related cancers. A cocktail of pendant drugs could be delivered by water-soluble polymer platforms. The physical and chemical properties of the polymers used in polymer-drug conjugates are specially synthesized to flow through the kidneys and liver without being filtered out, allowing the drugs to be used more effectively. Traditional polymers used in polymer-drug conjugates can be degraded through enzymatic activity and acidity. Polymers are now being synthesized to be sensitive to specific enzymes that are apparent in diseased tissue. The drugs remain attached to the polymer and are not activated until the enzymes associated with the diseased tissue are present. This process significantly minimizes damage to healthy tissue.Chau, Ying. \\"Targeted Drug Delivery by Novel Polymer- drug Conjugates Containing Linkers Cleavable by Disease-associated Enzymes.\\" DSpace@MIT :. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2005. Web. 12 Dec. 2012. Method of delivery Most typical deliver of drugs is through the mouth, skin, transmucosal and inhalation. Drug polymer conjugate follow these to some degree, but they are usually administered via injection. Many enzymes in the body decompose the drug if the drug is taken by other means. Currently Being Tested The polymer-drug N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer- doxorubicin (PK1; FCE28068) shows up to a 5 times reduction in anthracycline type toxicity compared to current treatments. Doses up to 1680 mg/m2 observed no cardiotoxicity. Antitumor behavior was observed at 80‚Äì320 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Polymers are used for the delivery of drugs and proteins. Some types of polymers being tested now are poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) copolymers have been successful in medical research. Recently there has been a growing interest in polymer conjugation with biologically active components. Such conjugates usually accumulate in tumors and can reduce toxicity in the body. Depending on the desired location, polymer conjugates can be synthesized to either have degradable or non-degradable chemical bonds with their associated drug. To obtain many of many of these bonds the use of peptides or amino acids. There is a strong desire to synthesize polymeric conjugates with bioactive components and other drugs. The tendency of polymer drug conjugate to react with the proper type cell(s) needs to still be worked on, despite many current advances.Khandare, Jayant, and Tamara Minko. \\"Polymer\\"drug Conjugates: Progress in Polymeric Prodrugs.\\" ScienceDirect.com. Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, n.d. Web. 12 Dec. 2012. Novel Polymer-Based Combinations By now only traditional chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin, paclitaxel, camptothecins and platinates have been clinically tested in drug conjugates. Due to successful clinical proof-of-concept, second-generation conjugates are now being developed. Experimental chemotherapy and novel polymer-based combinations are currently under investigation. Instead of passive targeting developed so far, new approaches will provide receptor-mediated delivery. This will enable selective delivery of anticancer conjugates. A natural polymer dextrin and pendant chain polyacetals, have shown ability of pH-dependent degradation after incorporation into cell compartments. Also diethylstilboestrol (DES) conjugates can undergo pH-dependent degradation. Polymer-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (PDEPT) is an example of two-step anticancer treatment.

Viking Press) A Day Late and a Dollar Short (2002) is Terry McMillan's fifth novel. It is about a family in Las Vegas in 1994. Family charts in the end pages assist readers in keeping track of who is who in the large and dysfunctional Price family. Plot Unlike McMillan's previous novels, A Day Late and a Dollar Short emphasizes the love and bonds of adult family members instead of friends. It explores relationships between parents, their children, and siblings. When the reader is introduced to the characters, they witness a damaged family become torn even further apart. Near the resolution they will see how this torn family picks up the pieces to come together. The story is told from the perspectives of six different characters (each a member of the Price family). They deal with contemporary concepts like prescription drug addiction, alcoholism, incest, homosexuality, molestation, single parenthood, and divorce. Characters Paris is divorced with a son who will soon be turning 17. She is always trying to help her family even though she hasn't been able to help herself. While she focuses on helping her family, she fails to acknowledge that her own life is in shambles. Her son is an amazing athlete who may have got his white girlfriend pregnant. She is considered to be the most successful of her siblings though she battles a prescription drug addiction behind closed doors. Lewis is considered to be the screw up in the family. His constant troubles with the law confirm his family's low opinion of him. He shows up drunk and broke when he visits his mother in the hospital. He struggles to learn how to take control of his own life instead of blaming or depending on others. Lewis is also dealing with the repercussions of being sexually abused as a child and early onset arthritis. His ex-wife is married to a white man that wants to adopt his son. Charlotte feels like she doesn't belong in the Price family. She feels like she never got as much attention as her older sister so she takes out her frustrations on the younger ones. She tends not to speak to her mother or older sister because she feels that they conspire against her. Charlotte has an openly gay son and two energetic daughters with ADD. Janelle is the youngest of her siblings. She has a teenage daughter that she's struggling to raise. Janelle is also in denial and must face the realization that she has failed to protect her daughter within the confines of their own home. She has been going to college for 15 years and has still not earned her degree. Viola Price is the dominant voice in the novel. She has a strained marriage with Cecil. They have four grown kids located in various places throughout the country. Their tumultuous marriage has lasted 38 years. In the beginning of the story she describes her family, ‚ÄúI don't even want to think about Cecil right now, because it might just bring on another attack. He's a bad habit I've had for thirty-eight years, which would make him my husband. Between him and these kids, I'm worn out. It's a miracle I can breathe at all. I had 'em so fast they felt more like a litter, except each one turned out to be a different animal. Paris is a female lion who don't roar loud enough. Lewis is a horse who don't pull his own weight. Charlotte is definitely a bull, and Janelle would have to be a sheep - a lamb is closer to it - 'cause she always being led out to some pasture and don't know how she got there.\\" Cecil, Viola's hardworking husband, has shut the door behind him for the last time and has taken his life in a new direction, regardless of what his wife and kids think about it. The weight of bringing the family together rests on her already heavy shoulders. At the end of the novel, Viola dies from her last attack of asthma. Her death brings the family together as they read letters she wrote to them before passing away. She teaches them that nothing is more important than family.

This dam was constructed as part of the Idukki Hydroelectric Project along with two other dams at Idukki and Kulamavu. The project was completed with Canadian aid. The Government of Canada aided the Project with long-term loans and grants. S.N.C.Inc., Canada, a firm of Consulting Engineers were advising and assisting Project Engineers under the Canadian Aid.http://manojissacparayan.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-idukki- dam.pdf The water impounded by these three dams of Idukki, Cheruthoni & Kulamavu has formed a single reservoir spread over 60 km2 on a height of 2300 ft above Mean Sea Level. The Idukki Dam is a double curvature arch dam constructed across Periyar River in a narrow gorge between two granite hills and is the tallest double curvature arch dam in Asia.Cheruthoni Dam is located 1 km west of Idukki dam. The spill way of the Idukki Reservoir is in the Cheruthoni dam. Kulamavu Dam was constructed to prevent the water escape through a rivulet called Kilivally, 30 km west to Idukki Arch Dam. It is a 100 metres tall Masonry gravity dam. Construction of this Cheruthoni Dam, Idukki Arch Dam and Kulamavu Dam created an artificial lake of 60 km2 and the water stored, is used for production of electricity at the Moolamattom Power house. The power house at Moolamattom is the biggest underground power station in India and the pressure shaft is the largest in the country. Cheruthoni is the largest and highest gravity dam in Kerala. Storage of water in Idukki Reservoir started in February, 1973. Moolamattom Power Station was Commissioned in February 1976 by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Releases Thrice in total, the floodgates of Cheruthoni had to be opened; twice during the northeast monsoon (October to December) of 1981 and 1992 and once during the 2018 Kerala floods. The first time was in 1981 (when the shutters were repeatedly opened and shut between 29 October and 13 November) and the second time was in 1992 (when they were kept open for 12 days from 12 to 23 October) and recently during the great flood of 2018 from 9 August 2018 to 7 September 2018, all 5 shutters were opened while all 14 districts of kerala were put under Red Alert with heavy disaster creating destruction all over kerala. On the first 2 occasions, the water level in the dam touched the brim only when the storage built up during the southwest monsoon (June to September) was augmented by the inflow received immediately afterwards following heavy downpour early in the northeast monsoon. On 9 August 2018, after a gap of 26 years, owing to continuous downpour of the southwest monsoon, the floodgates of dam in Idukki was opened. This was the first instance of water being released from the dam during the southwest monsoon season and also the first time in history when all 5 shutters of the dam were opened since it was commissioned in 1976. Kulamavu Dam Reservoir On 10 August 2018, all five radial floodgates of the dam were raised for the first time in history with the water level in the dam exceeding the 2400 ft mark. The water level kept rising in Asia's biggest arch dam even after opening the first sluice gate which lead to the opening of all five gates within a matter of 26 hours. The spill gates sent down 750 cumecs (7.5 lakh litres per second) of water downstream, along with the heavy downpours resulting in widespread flooding along the state's longest river. On 15 August 2018 the gates were raised further owing to continuous downpour and release of water from Mullaperiyar Dam sending 1000 cumecs of water downstream.

History  A.R.C. Publications was founded by John Grayson in Vancouver in the early 1970s and was active between 1971 and 1977. Born in Windsor, Ontario in 1943, Grayson was a Canadian instrument builder and sound sculptor also working as a lecturer at Toronto's York University, TV producer, exhibition curator and music educator ‚Äì conducting workshops with children, for instance. In the Sounds of Sound Sculpture book, Grayson presented himself as \\"a sound sculptor, university lecturer, experimental theatre producer and farmer\\". Grayson was the A.R.C.'s chief editor with a board of advisors including Grayson's wife Joan Costello, Stuart Calder ‚Äì an educator working with disabled children at University of British Columbia, as well as American writers and composers Michael Byron (b. 1953) and David Rosenboom (b. 1947). The latter was professor at Toronto's York University Department of Music in the 1970s, and, with Byron, was the editor of the Journal of Experimental Aesthetics (J.E.A.) they founded in Vancouver in 1974 and subsequently published by A.R.C. from 1976.  Publications  Though the A.R.C.'s output is small (5 books and 3 LPs, several issues of J.E.A.), a number of their releases proved influential and groundbreaking. * The Sounds of Sound Sculpture: First conceived as an exhibition curated by John Grayson in 1975 and subsequently published as a book and LP by A.R.C. Publications in 1975, the Sounds of Sound Sculpture was the first of its kind to examine sound sculpture as an art form and to propose a history of the genre, list current practitioners ca.1975 and to foresee a future for the genre as an art practice and educational tool. A pioneering work, the project included French instrument builders the Baschet Brothers, Stephan Von Huene, Harry Bertoia's neatly designed resonant steel rods, Harry Partch instruments as well as other US and Canadian artists like David Jacobs, Reinhold Marxhausen, William Colvig or Ivor Darreg. * Pieces: An Anthology: A pupil of James Tenney at CalArts, Michael Byron self-published the first volume of the historical Pieces: An Anthology series in 1976, a collection of process music and graphic scores by contemporary composers including Robert Ashley, Philip Corner, Alvin Lucier, Frederic Rzewski, Richard Teitelbaum, Alvin Curran, Paul Dresher, Peter Garland, Malcolm Goldstein, Daniel Goode, Dick Higgins or James Tenney, among others. This inaugural, soft-cover edition was reissued by A.R.C. in a hard- cover, revised edition in 1976, while Byron self-published 2 additional volumes in 1976 and 1977. * Biofeedback and The Arts & Brainwave Music: Inspired by the work of neuroscientist Dr. E. Roy John and Manfred Clynes, and the use of brainwaves to generate music by Alvin Lucier in 1965 (Music for Solo Performer), Rosenboom founded the Laboratory of Experimental Aesthetics in 1972 as a division of York University's Faculty of Fine Arts in Toronto. From the start, Rosenboom and Grayson considered the Laboratory as an integral part of the Aesthetic Research Centre. Through the exploration of EEG signals (Electroencephalography) and cybernetic biofeedback systems, Rosenboom and visiting artists like John Cage, David Behrman, LaMonte Young and Marian Zazeela were able to develop artistic projects involving brain waves triggering sound devices via electric sensors.

Life He was born at Morpeth, where his father was a schoolmaster, but brought up in Durham. He was educated at Durham cathedral school, and in 1794 entered Christ Church, Oxford. There he obtained a Craven scholarship in 1796, and was elected Fellow of Oriel College in 1800. In 1810 he became one of the tutors of Oriel. In 1817 Davison was presented by Lord Liverpool to the vicarage of Sutterton, near Boston, Lincolnshire. Subsequent preferment was to the rectory of Washington, Durham, in 1818, and in 1826 to that of Upton-upon-Severn. For a few years he held the prebend of Sneating in St Paul's Cathedral, and in 1826, on the recommendation of Lord Liverpool, he was made a prebendary of Worcester Cathedral. Davison died 6 May 1834 at Cheltenham, where he had gone for his health. He was buried in the chancel of Worcester Cathedral. Views In relation to the Oriel Noetics, Davison wrote in support of Edward Copleston's campaign for reform of Oxford teaching, but stood on the conservative side of the group. With Edward Hawkins he was chary of the liberal stance of some Noetics, in particular Richard Whately and Thomas Arnold; but (unlike Hawkins) he was sympathetic to the early moves of John Keble and the Tractarians of the \\"Oxford Movement\\". Along with Copleston he contributed to the \\"liberal Tory\\" strand of the debate on the poor laws. Davidson, with Coplestone and Whately, formed a group in the Noetics of political economists in the sense of Robert Malthus. Works In theology Davison was a conservative. Finding radical and views on political questions in his parish, he opposed them in a tract, Dialogue between a Christian and a Reformer. Davison's major work was his Warburtonian lectures on prophecy, published as Discourses on Prophecy, in which are considered its Structure, Use, and Inspiration. It stressed to the moral element, and the progressive character of prophetic revelations. An Inquiry into the Origin and Intent of Primitive Sacrifice, and the Scripture Evidence respecting it; with observations on the opinions of Spencer, Bishop Warburton, Archbishop Magee, and other writers on the same subject. And some reflections on the Unitarian Controversy (1825) had this commentary from the writer of the preface to Davison's Remains and Occasional Publications: \\"...sacrifices, eucharistical and penitentiary, might be, and probably were, of human origin, though presently sanctioned by divine approbation; but that the idea of expiatory sacrifice was clearly supernatural\\". Davison was an occasional contributor to the Quarterly Review.Review of Replies to the Calumnies of the ‚ÄúEdinburgh Review‚Äù against Oxford, 1810; Remarks on Edgeworth's Essays on Professional Education, 1811; Review of Sir Samuel Romilly's Observations on the Criminal Law of England, 1812; Remarks on Baptismal Regeneration, 1816. Another of his publications was Considerations on the Poor Laws. He maintained that the law according relief to able-bodied poor should be gradually repealed. He felt that changes in law might become detrimental to the poor if too rapidly introduced. His proposal was that the law should cease to be operative in ten years, and that then a voluntary contribution should be made for cases of great need. Some Points on the Question of the Silk Trade stated, in a letter to George Canning, took a similar line, prompted by the collapse of the silk English industry. He also published sermons preached on public occasions.

History The parish was founded in 1578 by Franciscan friars, Fray John Baptist Lucarelli of Pesaro, Italy and Fray Sebasti√°n de San Francisco of Baesa, Spain. The original church was constructed with native materials, nipa and bamboo (in Barangay Nagreban or Nagrugcan) under its patron, St. Francis of Assisi. In 1598, Padres Saturmino Franco, Casimiro Melgosa and Aquilino Garc√≠a finished a 3-tiered bell tower for the church. In the same year, the Augustinians named Saint Monica as the town's new patron saint. On March 16, 1892, a massive earthquake destroyed the church, paving the way for reconstruction of the shrine of \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de Caridad\\" in 1893. It was later demolished and replaced with the present church in 1975. Construction and consecration The present church was started with the laying of cornerstone on September 8, 1975. The Church was finished and consecrated as a Marian Shrine on December 8, 1978 by Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio coinciding with the quadricentennial of the Christianization of Agoo. Cardinal Agostino Casaroli's re-script dated July 15, 1982 signed for Pope John Paul II granted Bishop Salvador Lazo's petition elevating the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity to a Minor Basilica.http://shrines.healthypinoy.com/luzon/our-lady-of- charity.html In the Philippines, the Vatican granted 12 minor basilicas, with the Agoo Basilica as the 6th in order of their institution. 1990 Luzon earthquake The Basilica was badly damaged during the catastrophic 7.7-magnitude Luzon earthquake of July 16, 1990, which struck at 4.26 p.m. badly annihilating Agoo, La Union and other coastal areas.http://www.eird.org/esp/cdcapra/pdf/eng/doc13258/doc13258-4a.pdf The Basilica was again repaired and renovated.

Architectural details The facade of the Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity The Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity is noted for its Mexican-Baroque architectural features. A rosette stained glass window upon the Basilica‚Äôs facade is a marked contrast to the gray color of the front wall. Amid the statues of Saints Peter and Paul statues at the main door are carved Hebrew scripts, which is a short form of the Ten Commandments. Agoo Basilica's unconventional architecture is demonstrated by its two non-identical bell towers. To the left of the facade is a four-level hexagonal tower, while the right bell tower is a bell-gable in its form. The confessional and the ceiling has a similar architecture. One is in front of the stained glass window of the Crucifixion of Jesus with the two thieves. The reredos of the altar has eight wooden panels with intricately carved floral design focused on its center. At the top center of the panel hangs a large crucifix. Above the panel is where the foot-high Our Lady of Charity statue is enshrined under large canopy supported by four twisted columns. Her feet rest on an urn-shaped pedestal with the same floral design as the reredos. Two angels flanked her sides behind a silvery backdrop. A pipe organ in the choir loft watches the craved chandeliers dotting the middle aisle, 2-tiered and carved or made of Filipino mahogany, demonstrating the rich heritage and vast culture of Agoo.

On 22 June 1941 the division was still located in the district. The division was assigned to the 21st Army moving from the Volga Military District to Gomel in the Western Special Military District when the war started. The army was to attack north from Gomel area into the flank and rear of the German advance. On 5‚Äì6 July 1941 the division attacked across the Dnepr River at Zhlobin as part of the 63rd Rifle Corps and 21st Army. Of the 12,000 men assigned to the division and despite the support of the 546th Corps Artillery Regiment the division lost almost 20% of its strength in the space of two days. By 12 July the division was retreating back behind the Dnepr River.

It was written in the 1820s, making it one of his earliest works and his first known work in the fairytale genre, but its existence was apparently unknown to scholars or the public for almost two centuries. A copy of the manuscript was discovered in a filing box in the National Archives of Funen in October 2012. Plot A tallow candle, whose parents are a sheep and a melting pot, becomes more and more disheartened as it cannot find a purpose in life. It meets a tinderbox who lights a flame on the candle, and it finally finds its right place in life and spreads joy and happiness for itself and its fellow creatures. Discovery The manuscript was discovered in late 2012 in a suitcase with documents belonging to the Plum family in the local branch of the Danish National Archives in Funen, Denmark. The first people to come across the document were a couple doing amateur research into their family history, but they thought nothing of it since it seemed unrelated to genealogy. Later the archivist and local historian Esben Brage noted the document's signature and realized that it might be an original H. C. Andersen document. Danish experts confirmed its authorship in December 2012. Commentaries and criticism Andersen scholars agree that the work is not of the same literary quality as his later tales, and that it has many similarities with other writings from his time at the Latinate schools in Slagelse and Elsinore. It was dedicated to Madame Bunkeflod, a vicar's widow and one of the young Andersen's benefactors. One scholar argued that the tale was overly didactic and moralistic, and lacking Andersen's later sense of humor, probably to impress his benefactress, who had paid for his education. Danish author and Andersen specialist Johannes M√∏llehave opined that the tale could have been written by any bright 15-year-old and that it displayed nothing of Andersen's later virtuosity. Two Danish philologists have expressed doubts about the authorship of the fairy tale. They argue that the tale is too close in form to the models used in the Latinate schools of the time for it to be likely to be an original composition, and they have also expressed disbelief in the use of the word formfuldendt (\\"flawless\\") which does not otherwise appear in texts until much later. Since the manuscript is difficult to read there is a possibility that what is written is in fact another word. Christian Graugaard, a Danish poet and professor of sexology, has analyzed the tale as a covert autoerotic tale, in which the candle symbolizes the phallus and the melting tallow the semen in an ejaculation. According to him Andersen often added erotic undertones and metaphoric phallic imagery in his tales. He characterizes the fairy tale as \\"a literary cumshot\\".

In the meantime, Suddi depends on various men in the village to provide her provisions by sleeping with them. Some time before Romial comes home, Suddi starts sleeping with Mudalali (Sommie Rathnayake), a shrewd businessman from town, and he becomes her main lover and provider. Romial had been hired by Arachchila (Joe Abeywickrama), the local ex-headman, to kill an unnamed villager. Mudalali is married to Arachchila's only sister, mainly for the respect and the wealth she had inherited. The movie is set in the era of the Grama Niladhari system, which undermines Arachchila's village position, and Mudilali's connection with the new grama niladhari provokes Arachchila. Muralali informs Avusadaya (Ananda Wijesinghe), a tenant farmer who works on Arachchila's land, of the Paddy Lands Act passed through Parliament in Colombo; this new law would force landowners to share the excess land with the landless. This conversation sets forth the conflict between Arachchila and Avusadaya. Romial returns from jail to the village. Arachchila handed him over the contract to destroy Aushadaya by killing Peter (Salaman Fonseka), the brother of Aushadaya with whom he had regular quarrels after he gets drunk. When Romial hesitates to get back to violence, Suddi encourages him to go ahead with the killings. The murder trap ends with both Peter and Arachchila's deaths. However Romial who commits the murder regrets this. He decided to help Peter's wife (Nilanthi Wijesinghe), who is left helpless after Peter's death, and remains unaware about the murder. Soon, Peter's wife falls in love with Romial, while Mudalali and Suddi continue with their affair.

The band debuted in March 1981, played the first Black Flag show on the East Coast shortly thereafter,Andersen and Jenkins 83 and embarked on an aborted tour with Minor ThreatAndersen and Jenkins 92 that ended when Clinton's mother demanded the return of their tour van, which she owned.Andersen and Jenkins 95Steve Blush, American Hardcore: A Tribal History, Feral House, 2010 (second edition), pp. 160 They recorded a demo at Inner Ear Studios in mid-1981. Their only release during this era was the Possible 7\\" EP on Dischord. Its title was a tongue-in- cheek response to Ian MacKaye, who cited a \\"possible EP by Youth Brigade\\" in an early Dischord ad.Andersen and Jenkins 98 They played their final show in December, and had three songs included on the Flex Your Head compilation released in January 1982. Legacy and reunion Though short-lived, the band is cited as an early influence on the development of hardcore punk in the United States and in Washington, D.C. more locally.Michael Azerrad, Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981‚Äì1991, Little Brown, 2010, pp. 127Jeff Apter, The Dave Grohl Story, Omnibus Press, 2018, pp. 18 Their scant recordings and appearance on the popular Flex Your Head compilation have helped them to continue to remain influential. Additionally, several band members went on to other notable projects. Queiroz was in the later Dischord bands Double-O (briefly alongside Clinton), Second Wind, and the post-hardcore band Rain. He also had a stint in The Meatmen. Ingram went on to play in the U.K. band Swervedriver, Strange Boutique, EmmaPeel, and Dot Dash. Strejcek left Dischord and the hardcore music scene soon after the band's breakup. On December 29, 2012, Strejcek, Ingram, and Quieroz reunited for a Youth Brigade show at the Washington, D.C. club The Black Cat, with Steve Hansgen (ex-Minor Threat, ex-Government Issue, and then a member of Ingram's group Dot Dash) playing guitar. The show was a benefit for the D.C. hardcore documentary Salad Days and also featured Scream and Government Issue. That same foursome played a second show in February 2013 at the 9:30 Club as part of the \\"Punk-Funk Throwdown\\" series. In 2015, Dischord issued the Youth Brigade demo recording as the Complete First Demo EP. Writing for PunkNews.org, critic Alexander Lalama praised the record's raw musicianship and production, calling it a \\"gem\\" of a \\"historical document\\".

Assumed to be a commercially produced reproduction, Germany, c. last quarter of the nineteenth century Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg (◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë ◊¶◊ë◊ô ◊û◊ß◊ú◊†◊ë◊ï◊®◊í) was a German rabbi and scholar of the 19th century, best known as author of the Torah commentary Haketav VehaKabbalah (HaKsav VeHaKabalah). Biography He was born in 1785 (5545 in the Hebrew calendar) in Lissa (Leszno), in the province of Posen, Germany, in the family of Rabbi Gamliel. At the time, Lissa was a famous center of Torah studies, and Mecklenburg began studying Torah as a student of the local Rav, Zechariah Mendel, a friend and correspondent of Rabbi Akiva Eger. Zechariah Mendel was the son of David Tebla, the previous Rav of Lissa. R. Mecklenburg initially thereafter went into business. In 1831, at the age of 46, following commercial difficulties, he decided to quit business and was offered the rabbinical position in the city of K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia. At that time, K√∂nigsberg Jews were under the increasing influence of the Haskalah, a reform movement, which Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg strongly opposed. Together with the Malbim, he publicly opposed Reform Judaism's 1844 Braunschweig convention. In the same period, he wrote Haketav VehaKabbalah, his own commentary to the Torah. He served as Rabbi in K√∂nigsberg, for the rest of his life, for 34 years (1831‚Äì65). Before his death, he ordered that no eulogies be given at his funeral. In his will, he requested that Haketav VehaKabbalah be read after the public Torah reading, during the first 30 days of mourning. In the opinion of others, Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi studied directly under Rabbi Akiva Eiger. He mentions in his Haketav VehaKabbaleh Rabbi A. Eiger a few times as 'my Mentor and Teacher'. Example: In Leviticus 27:32, he states: I asked my Mentor and Teacher Rabbi Akiva Eger, etc. Works A modern edition of Haketav VehaKabbalah. Haketav VehaKabbalah (alt. HaKsav VeHaKabalah; Heb. ◊î◊õ◊™◊ë ◊ï◊î◊ß◊ë◊ú◊î: The Written [Torah] and the [Oral] Tradition) was first published in 1839. Mecklenburg's intent was \\"to demonstrate the indivisibility of the written Torah and its counterpart, the oral Torah‚Äù. His explanations thus connect the literal meaning (peshat) to the hidden meaning (derash), focusing on the traditional Jewish sources (the Mishna, the Talmud, and the Midrash). The commentary draws on that of the Vilna Gaon and Shadal and occasionally includes contemporary non-traditional sources such as Julius F√ºrst and the Biurists. See Oral Torah #In rabbinic literature and commentary. Other works include: *Iyun Tefillah - a commentary on the Siddur, usually coupled with Derech HaChaim written by R. Yaakov Lorberbaum of Lisa. *Hishtapchut HaNefesh - viduy (confessional prayers) for the eve of Yom Kippur.

It is the first Super Robot Wars (SRW) game for the 3DS and was released in Japan on March 14, 2013. The theme of this game is \\"Possibilities\\". Gameplay Gameplay of Super Robot Wars UX inherits the same gameplay from Super Robot Wars L on being a tactical RPG using animated sprites. Controls in the game depends on the use of the stylus, directional buttons and the Circle Pad, with the 3D feature used to zoom in and out of some maps. When a stage begins, the character receives introductory dialogue between playable characters, leading to the scenario on the battle field. To complete a scenario, the player must accomplish scenario objectives. Some scenarios are longer, with multi-part missions or have new objectives added as the story unfolds. On battle field, the player and enemy take turns to order their units with commands available, such as movement, attacking, forming squads and casting \\"Spirit Commands\\", a set of magic-like spells unique to each pilot. Once the scenario is cleared, more dialogue is exchanged between characters before the player is taken to an intermission menu. Here, units can be upgraded or optional parts installed, characters' stats and skills can be changed or upgraded, and other maintenance actions can be performed before the player continues on with the game. Aside from the usual features, UX also features dynamic animated cutscenes in each scenario and attacks and a Partner Unit System, similar to the Twin Battle System of Super Robot Wars: Original Generations. Units can be deployed in a team of two units or a single unit depending on the situation. It also feature Skill Parts, which can be used to update and strengthen each unit. The game also has purchasable downloadable content, the first in the series. Players can buy and download mission maps and campaigns through the Nintendo eShop.

Adriaan van Emont Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Houbraken had mentioned him twice earlier; as a specialist in painting water birds and plants, and as the teacher of the Dordrecht painter Johannes Offermans.Eemont in Houbraken's Roelant Savry biographyAdriaan Emont in Houbraken's Ary Huibertsz Verveer biography According to the RKD he is known for fruit still lifes and is possibly the same person as the landscape painter who signed with the monogram \\"AVE\\".Adriaen van Eemont in the RKD He worked in Amsterdam, Heusden and France. In France he traveled with Frederik de Moucheron to Paris and Lyon. There is still some uncertainty about the nature of his work; though Houbraken was so certain that he had specialized in birds and plants, the Dordrechts Museum has a work by him that is more reminiscent of Haarlem works such as those by Adriaen van Ostade.Adriaen van Eemont in the Dordrechts Museum Confusion with Nicolaes Ficke His monogram \\"AVE\\" has also been interpreted as \\"NF\\" for Nicolaes Ficke, a 17th-century painter from Haarlem.

It is known in Japanese as the Hitobarai Rei or Ninbetsu Aratame. The edict ordered a complete national census that was submitted in a document stating the number of households in each village and the gender, approximate age, and profession of their inhabitants. Its purpose was said to be gauging the nation's military potential and the number of laborers that could be mobilized for Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea. The Population Census Edict also had clauses in common with the Separation Edict that had been issued the previous year in 1591 and it contributed to the process of socially separating of the warrior class and peasant class. It thus can be seen as part of both Hideyoshi's policy of expansion into Asia and his policy of strengthening the social class structure. Although it was recorded in the historical document Chronicles of the Kikkawa Clan that the Population Census Edict was promulgated in 1591, more recent research has called this into question and most experts now agree on 1592 as the correct date.Asao Naohiro, \\"The Sixteenth-Century Unification,\\" in The Cambridge History of Japan: Early Modern Japan, ed.

Edward Loftus. The art cluster: team teaching in a gifted and talented elementary program. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1995 The emerging telecommunications have developed a new form of communication, much faster and more direct. This allows people to work from anywhere in the world. People can easily group or perform any type of organization. Art Cluster also refers artistic production of collective intelligence. The integration of social movement in the cyberspace is one of the potential strategies of this social movement. Precedents and precursors In Manhattan in 2003 Bill Wasik, senior editor of Harper's Magazine, creates the first Flash mob. A flash mob is a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual and seemingly pointless act for a brief time, then quickly disperse, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, and artistic expression. Flash mobs began as a form of performance art.Goldstein, Lauren (August 10, 2003 (April 18, 2003 issue)). \\"The Mob Rules\\". Time Europe 162 (7). . . Retrieved March 14, 2007.. While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political demonstrations. Flash mobs can be seen as a specialized form of smart mob, a term and concept proposed by author Howard Rheingold in his 2002 book Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution.Wasik, Bill (March 2006). \\"My Crowd, or, Phase 5: A report from the inventor of the flash mob\\" (Subscription). Harper's Magazine: 56‚Äì66. . . Retrieved February 2, 2007. The convergence culture is an important factor in Art Cluster. Henry Jenkins determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want.Jenkins, H. Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide. New York: New York UP, 2006. Print Art Cluster actions were captured in the form of itinerant exhibitions and printed editions of fanzines in 2005.This collective actions was promoted by Jofre Oliveras, artist and cultural manager who created the movement in Spain. Use of the term The first documented use of the term Art Cluster as it is understood today was in 2011 in a blog entry posted in the aftermath of cultural platform event from Girona.Art cluster The term was inspired by the computing cluster that consists of a set of loosely connected computers that work together so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system.

As one of the earliest groups advocating for an intersectional approach to women's oppression, members of the TWWA argued that women of color faced a \\"triple jeopardy\\" of race, gender, and class oppression. Though the organization's roots lay in the black civil rights movement, it soon broadened its focus to include women of color in the US and in developing nations. History The Third World Women's Alliance began in New York City as the Black Women's Liberation Committee (BWLC), which was a caucus of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Black women within SNCC, including Frances Beal, created the BWLC in 1968 to address the issue of male chauvinism within the anti-racism movement. In 1970 they renamed the group the Black Women's Alliance (BWA), becoming independent from SNCC but maintaining close political ties with it. Later that year, the group's common work and dialogue with Puerto Rican women transformed the BWA into the Third World Women's Alliance. Cheryl Perry (then Cheryl Johnson), who had been recruited into the New York TWWA chapter through friends connected to the Venceremos Brigade, established a second chapter in the Bay Area in 1971. The same year, the New York chapter began publishing the TWWA newspaper Triple Jeopardy, using it to stress the ideological connections between capitalist exploitation, global imperialism, and the oppression of women of color. The first issue of Triple Jeopardy asserted that \\"the struggle against racism and imperialism must be waged simultaneously with the struggle for women's liberation\\" by \\"a strong independent socialist women's group.\\" The TWWA struggled internally with homophobia, and the West Coast branch lost several lesbian members. In contrast, the East Coast branch incorporated a position against heterosexism into its principles of struggle. They wrote in Triple Jeopardy: The New York branch folded in 1977. In the same year, the Bay Area branch transformed itself into a mass activist organization, and began forming committees for external work. Committees formed during that period include the National Committee to Overturn the Bakke Decision, the Southern Africa Organizing Committee, the Josina Machel Committee and the Coalition to Fight Infant Mortality. By 1979 the TWWA re-organized to become the Alliance Against Women's Oppression (AAWO). The AAWO existed from 1980-1989, and then took new form again as the Women of Color Resource Center. Contributions The TWWA was one of several organizations formed by women of color in the late 1960s and early 1970s as responses to the essentialist theories of the early feminist movement. These organizations paved the way for Chicana feminism, Womanism, and Black feminism, among other theoretical approaches to feminism. TWWA broadened the scope of women's activism to address issues such as sterilization abuse, infant mortality, welfare rights, and low-wage work. Through its political activities, TWWA helped to create spaces in racial justice organizations for women's voices, issues and leadership. Although primarily an activist organization, concepts developed by TWWA's members in the course of political organization contributed much to feminist theory. TWWA's ideas of \\"double jeopardy\\" and \\"triple jeopardy\\" which were elaborated on by scholars as \\"simultaneity of oppression\\" and \\"both/and,\\" advanced the understanding of the intersectionality of race, class, and gender in the women's movement. It also contributed to the experience of building \\"third world\\" and \\"black/brown\\" unity in opposing racism and sexism. The orientation of TWWA towards the \\"third world\\" brought the struggles, condition, and status of women in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East to the forefront. TWWA built relations with women's organizations in other countries, pioneering a form of feminism that focuses on the affect of U.S. foreign and military policy on women's lives worldwide, promoting the idea that U.S. women of color had a role to play in the \\"global sisterhood.\\" References External links *Third World Women's Alliance, Bay Area chapter records at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Special Collections *Third World Women's Alliance, Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History *Black Women's Manifesto *Digitized issues of Triple Jeopardy (1971-1975) Category:Women's rights organizations Category:African Americans' rights organizations ","title":"Third World Women's Alliance"},{"id":"37917585","text":"In superparamagnetism (a form of magnetism), the N√©el effect appears when a superparamagnetic material in a conducting coil is subject to varying frequencies of magnetic fields. The non-linearity of the superparamagnetic material acts as a frequency mixer, with voltage measured at the coil terminals. It consists of several frequency components, at the initial frequency and at the frequencies of certain linear combinations. The frequency shift of the field to be measured allows for detection of a direct current field with a standard coil. Magnetizing superparamagnetic material  History  In 1949 French physicist Louis N√©el (1904-2000) discovered that when they are finely divided, ferromagnetic nanoparticles lose their hysteresis below a certain size;Proceedings weekly meetings of the Academy of Sciences, 1949-1901 (T228) -1949/06, pp. 664-666.Louis N√©el, \\"Theory of ferromagnetic magnetic drag grained applications with the terracotta\\" , in Annals of Geophysics V, , February 1949, pp. 99-136. this phenomenon is known as superparamagnetism. The magnetization of these materials is subject to the applied field, which is highly non-linear. This curve is well described by the Langevin function, but for weak fields it can be simply written as: : M(H) = \\\\chi_0H + N_eH^3 + \\\\varepsilon(H^3), where \\\\chi_0 is the susceptibility at zero field and N_e is known as the N√©el coefficient. The N√©el coefficient reflects the non- linearity of superparamagnetic materials in low fields.  Theory  Illustration of the N√©el effect If a coil of N turns with a surface S through which passes a current of excitation I_\\\\text{exc} is immersed in a magnetic field H_{ext} collinear with the axis of the coil, a superparamagnetic material is deposited inside the coil. The electromotive force to the terminals of a winding of the coil, e, is given by the formula: : e = -d\\\\phi /dt = - SdB/dt where B is the magnetic induction given by the equation: : B = \\\\mu_0 \\\\mu_r (H + M) In the absence of magnetic material, : M = 0 and : B = \\\\mu_0 \\\\mu_r (H_{ext} + H_\\\\text{exc}). Differentiating this expression, the frequency of the voltage is the same as the excitation current i_\\\\text{exc} or the magnetic field H_{ext}. In the presence of superparamagnetic material, neglecting the higher terms of the Taylor expansion, we obtain for B: : B = \\\\mu_0\\\\mu_r((1 + \\\\chi_0)(H_{ext} + H_\\\\text{exc}) + N_e (H_{ext} + H_\\\\text{exc})^3) A new derivation of the first term of the equation \\\\mu_0 \\\\mu_r (1 + \\\\chi_0) (H_{ext} + H_\\\\text{exc}) provides frequency voltage components of the stream of excitement i_\\\\text{exc} or the magnetic field H_{ext}. The development of the second term (H_{ext} + H_\\\\text{exc})^3 = H_{ext}^3 + 3H_{ext}^2H_\\\\text{exc} + 3H_{ext}H_\\\\text{exc}^2 + H_\\\\text{exc}^3 multiplies the frequency components in which intermodular frequencies start components and generate their linear combinations. The non-linearity of the superparamagnetic material acts as a frequency mixer. Calling H(l) the total magnetic field within the coil at the abscissa, integrating the above induction coil along the abscissa between 0 and L_p and differentiating with respect to t obtains: : u(t) = L \\\\frac{dI(t)}{dt} + F_{Rog} \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left[\\\\int_0^{H} Lp(l) dl \\\\right] + F_\\\\text{Neel} \\\\left[\\\\int_0^H Lp(l) dl \\\\right] I(t) \\\\frac{dI(t)}{dt} with I_\\\\text{exc}(t) = I_\\\\text{exc}\\\\cos(w_\\\\text{exc}t) Spectral representation of the appearance of EMF due to the N√©el effect around a high-frequency carrier The conventional terms of self-inductance and Rogowski effect are found in both the original frequencies. The third term is due to the N√©el effect; it reports the intermodulation between the excitation current and the external field. When the excitation current is sinusoidal, the effect is N√©el characterized by the appearance of a second harmonic carrying the information flow field: :u(t) = LI_\\\\text{exc}w_\\\\text{exc}\\\\cos(w_\\\\text{exc}t) + F_{Rog}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left[\\\\int_0^{Lp}H_{ext}(l)dl\\\\right] + F_\\\\text{Neel}\\\\left[\\\\int_0^{Lp}H_{ext}(l)dl\\\\right]\\\\frac{I_\\\\text{exc}^2}{2}w_\\\\text{exc}\\\\sin(2w_\\\\text{exc}t)  Applications  Design of N√©el-effect current sensor An important application of the N√©el effect is as a current sensor, measuring the magnetic field radiated by a conductor with a current;Magnetic field and current control method and magnetic core for these sensors / publicationDetails / library? CC = EN & NR = 2891917 \\"Patent FR 2891917.\\" this is the principle of N√©el effect current sensors.method for measuring current by means of a flow sensor of magnetic fields of a specific shape, and the resulting system has from such a process, \\"Patent FR 2971852\\"] The N√©el effect allows the accurate measurement of currents with very low-frequency-type sensors in a current transformer without contact. The transducer of a N√©el-effect current sensor consists of a coil with a core of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The coil is traversed by a current excitation: : i_\\\\text{exc}(t). In the presence of an external magnetic field to be measured: : H_{ext}(t) the transducer transposes (with the N√©el effect) the information to be measured, H (f) around a carrier frequency, the harmonic of order 2 excitation current 2: : f_\\\\text{exc} which is simpler. The electromotive force generated by the coil is proportional to the magnetic field to measure: : H_{ext}(t) and to the square of the excitation current: : fem(t) = F_\\\\text{Neel} i_\\\\text{exc}^2(t) H(t) To improve the measurement's performance (such as linearity and sensitivity to temperature and vibration), the sensor includes a second permanent winding- reaction against it to cancel the second harmonic. The relationship of the current reaction against the primary current is proportional to the number of turns against reaction: : I_{cr} = I_p / N_{cr}.

Mohawk produces floor covering products for residential and commercial applications in North America and residential applications in Europe. The company manufacturing portfolio consists of soft flooring products (carpet and rugs), hard flooring products (ceramic tile, natural stone and hardwood flooring), laminate flooring, sheet vinyl and luxury vinyl tile. The company employs 37,800 in operations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, India, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and the United States. In 2015, Mohawk was recognized as the most used, top-brand familiarity, and top-quality rating carpet product by the Builder magazine. History William Shuttleworth and his four sons arrived in the United States in 1875 and set up a carpet mill in the Hudson Valley upon arrival. After William Shuttleworth died, the four sons moved to Amsterdam, New York in 1878 and took over an empty factory there. The company incorporated as the Shuttleworth Brothers Company in 1902. The company adopted the name Mohawk Carpet Mills (or Mohawk Mills, for short) in 1920, when it merged with McCleary, Wallin and Crouse, another mill in Amsterdam. It became the country's sole weaver to offer an entire line of domestic carpets, also creating the industry's first textured design and sculptured weave. In 1956, Mohawk Carpet Mills merged with Alexander Smith, Inc. to become Mohasco Corporation, a company large enough to appear on the first Fortune 500 rankings. Mohasco faced competition from new tufted carpet operations in Georgia, which used synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester rather than the traditional wool used in woven carpets. To compete in a changing industry, Mohasco gradually moved manufacturing south into the Carolinas and eventually Georgia. In 1963, the company turned some of its attention to furniture manufacturing. Carpet manufacturing at the Amsterdam site ended by 1968 and the last corporate offices left by 1987. In 1988, Mohasco was purchased by MHS Holdings in a leveraged buyout, and the company's carpet business was spun off from Mohasco to form Mohawk Industries. Mohawk Industries factory in Commerce, Texas In 1992, Mohawk went public with its shares traded first on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\"NMS\\" and currently on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\"MHK.\\" Mohasco's remaining assets were sold to other investors, and the company was later dissolved. Through 2016, Mohawk Industries has acquired 34 companies into its conglomerate, and now operates manufacturing facilities in 15 countries‚Äîthe U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, the U.K., Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Russia and Malaysia.

The new ruler believes the tribe has gone soft and imposes a rigid discipline that allows sexual relations with men only once a year to procreate. Antiope also wants a return to a more egalitarian society, which doesn't sit well with Oreitheia and many of the other high Amazons, and she hatches various schemes to eliminate Antiope and take her place on the throne. Since there are no men in the tribe, the Amazons hire men from another nation once a year for reproductive purposes; an \\"unpleasant but necessary\\" ordeal which Antiope herself also dutifully participates in. The Amazons soon go to meet a group of Greek soldiers led King Theseus of Athens for their annual mating ceremony. Meanwhile, Oreitheia and her loyal followers attempt to undermine the queen's rule by slipping an aphrodisiac in her water, only for her handmaiden to drink it instead and suffer the effects. Curious about of the Amazons, Theseus pretends to be a low-ranking captain and has sex with Antiope, impregnating her in the process. Much to the queen's dismay, she quite enjoys her first time having sex with a man. The next day, during a series of contests held between the two groups, Antiope attempts to one-up Theseus in a show jumping competition after he attempts to impress her. This results in the queen injuring her leg and is left unable to perform in bed the following night. Theseus meets with Antiope to apologize for showing off and attempts to change her man-hating ways, but her resolve remains quite firm. Secretly worried that she has feelings for Theseus and being perceived as weak, Antiope orders the Amazons to depart for home a day early. The king recommends to the queen a certain way back to their home through the Blue Mountains, inadvertently sending the tribe into a Scythian ambush. Realizing his mistake, Theseus assembles a garrison of soldiers to aid the Amazons as they are attacked, and they drive off the Scythians. Believing that the Greeks deliberately set them up, the Amazons mount an expedition lead by Oreitheia to pillage the villages of the Scythians in retaliation. During the following months, Theseus has become smitten with the queen and sets up a makeshift camp near the Amazon's city. At one time covertly saving her from an assassination attempt and later sneaks into her bedchambers to make love to her again, the latter which she reluctantly accepts. Theseus also sends his wife Queen Phaedra to the city under the guise of a feminist representative from Crete, in order to learn more about the Amazon's matriarchal society. Suspicious of Phaedra's true motivations, Antiope followers her back to Theseus's campsite and discovers his deception. Seeing him with another women causes Antiope to believe the Theseus was merely using her and she angrily breaks off their relationship, making future plans for revenge. With their cover blown, Theseus and Phaedra return to Athens for the time being. The time finally comes for the queen to give birth, but to her sadness the child is a boy and is left out to die as male children are not wanted by the Amazons. The apparent loss of her son causes Antiope to become conflicted and later more outspoken when Oreitheia's war party returns successful from their campaign against the Scythians. This in turn causes Antiope to lose some support among her fellow Amazons. Taking advantage of the political turmoil, Oreitheia attempts to murder Antiope in her sleep, but the queen anticipates her betrayal and catches her by spear point. Deciding that they need to settle their dispute once and for all, the two Amazons engage in a nude wrestling match as a thunderstorm rages outside. Exhausted from their lengthy struggle, they end up falling into each other's embrace and become lovers. Antiope arranges for another meeting with the Greeks to mate again and then kill them all in revenge for their perceived role in setting up the ambush. Despite grim predictions from their priests that the mission will result in heavy losses, Oreitheia encourages Antiope to go through with it. Antiope and Theseus are finally reunited at the camp, where he confesses his love for her. After they're finished making love, Theseus reveals that he already knew about the assassination in advance thanks to some treacherous Amazons. The king also tells her that he had rescued their son (now named Hippolytus) and she slips out of the tent with him to go see her child in Athens. The other Amazons think she's been kidnapped, with only Oreitheia and few others realizing the truth, and chase after the Greeks to prevent word of this great dishonor from spreading. The Amazons eventually catch up and have a battle with the Greeks. To keep Antiope out of harms way, Theseus orders his men to tie her to the carriage against her will. As the conflict ensues, both side suffer casualties and Antiope can only watch helplessly as Oreitheia is killed on the battlefield. Deciding that there has been enough bloodshed, Theseus calls for the fighting to stop. In the aftermath of the battle, Antiope recognizes Oreitheia's desire to become queen, and places the ring symbolizing her status as queen on her finger. Having been conquered by the Greeks, Antiope and the survivors join them on the long journey back to Athens. Though disheartened that both she and the Amazons as a whole are now ruined, Antiope looks forward to her future role as Theseus's political advisor and is pleasantly surprised to find out that Phaedra is his first wife, not his lover.

With the Quad Cities area supporting two teams in this era, in 1914 a third Quad City team was added when the Moline Plowboys joined the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League, claiming Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby Kewanee Boilermakers were members of the Central Association (1908‚Äì1913, 1948‚Äì1949). The Rock Island Islanders first played 1883 as an Independent League team.

He was a member of several Yugoslav academies of sciences and arts, the author of more than a dozen historical books, and received several significant national awards. Ekmeƒçiƒá authored a number of important works in socialist Yugoslavia, including his contribution to the acclaimed History of Yugoslavia published in English in 1974, and Stvaranje Jugoslavije 1790‚Äì1918 [Creation of Yugoslavia 1790‚Äì1918] in 1989. He adopted Serbian nationalist views significantly during the breakup of Yugoslavia, served as an advisor to the convicted war criminal Radovan Karad≈æiƒá when he was President of Republika Srpska during the 1992‚Äì1995 Bosnian War, and was a founder of Karad≈æiƒá's radical nationalist Serb Democratic Party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was active in the revisionist wave of Serbian historiography from 1991, and an analysis of Serbian historiography since that year concluded that he was \\"complicit in the weaponisation of history, in particular that of the mass atrocities of the Second World War\\". The revisionist wave in Serbian historiography involved local historians eschewing the standards of international scholarship and concentrating exclusively on sectarian myths, resulting in the production of what has been described in historiographical assessment of the period as \\"pseudohistory\\". Early life Milorad Ekmeƒçiƒá was born on 4 October 1928 in Prebilovci near ƒåapljina in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina) to Ilija and Kristina Ekmeƒçiƒá. He attended elementary school in ƒåapljina, and high school in Mostar. When the Kingdom of Yugoslavia entered World War II due to the Axis invasion of the country in April 1941, Ekmeƒçiƒá remained in the ƒåapljina area until 1943. During the invasion, the Independent State of Croatia, a fascist puppet state, was established; the new state encompassed ƒåapljina. On 6 August 1941, the ruling Usta≈°e perpetrated the Prebilovci massacre, in which Ekmeƒçiƒá lost 78 members of his family, including his father and uncle. The surviving members of his family formed a unit of the Yugoslav Partisans resistance movement in Prebilovci. From October 1944 until July 1945, Ekmeƒçiƒá was a member of the Yugoslav Partisans. Career After completing high school in 1947, Ekmeƒçiƒá enrolled in general history undergraduate study at the University of Zagreb, from which he graduated in 1952. In the same year he took up an assistant position at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo. Ekmeƒçiƒá conducted research in archives in Zagreb, Belgrade, Zadar, and Vienna in Austria. He received his doctorate in history from the University of Zagreb in 1958 upon defending his dissertation entitled The uprising in Bosnia from 1875 to 1878, which has been published in three editions and translated into German. He visited Princeton University in 1961, and then continued his academic career as a professor of history at the University of Sarajevo where he worked as a full professor from 1968 until 1992 teaching \\"General History of the New Age\\" and \\"Introduction to the Science of History\\" courses. During this time he also spent some time as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan. Along with Vladimir Dedijer, Ivan Bo≈æiƒá and Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá, he co-authored History of Yugoslavia published in English in 1974, having already appeared in Serbo-Croatian in 1972. The book was hailed as \\"one of the most comprehensive histories of Yugoslavia in the English language\\", despite a tendency towards Marxist historiography and the absence of a detailed examination of the post-World War II period. In this book, Ekmeƒçiƒá drew upon nineteenth century developments to challenge the decentralists within Yugoslav historiographical thought who supported the separate national entities of the South Slavic nations. Instead, Ekmeƒçiƒá asserted that unitarian assimilation was to be preferred, saying that nationhood based on language was the only concept which was acceptable from both a rationalist and romanticist perspective. He also concluded that religion was to blame for the push towards decentralisation. His approach betrayed a double-standard, whereby he criticised only non-Serb South Slavic nationalism. In 1989, Ekmeƒçiƒá published Stvaranje Jugoslavije 1790‚Äì1918 [Creation of Yugoslavia 1790‚Äì1918]. According to the historian Jasna Dragoviƒá- Soso, in this book Ekmeƒçiƒá advanced the idea that Serbian national ideology was the \\"main integrative and pro-Yugoslav force\\", and blamed what he claimed was an \\"inherently obstructionist Croatian national ideology\\", based partly on \\"virulently anti-Serb Catholicism\\", for Yugoslavia's problems and its ultimate disintegration. This construction was criticised by the historian Ivo Banac, who claimed that \\"religion played virtually no part\\" in the development of Croatian national ideology. Shortly after the outbreak of the Bosnian War in 1992, Ekmeƒçiƒá was arrested by the government-loyalist Green Berets paramilitary unit along with his family. Initially held at the elementary school in Vratnik, he was then transferred to house arrest, from which he managed to flee to the Bosnian Serb-controlled proto-state known as the Republika Srpska. From 1992 to 1994 Ekmeƒçiƒá worked as a full professor at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Belgrade. During the time of socialist Yugoslavia, Ekmeƒçiƒá authored a number of important works. He retired on 1 October 1994. During his life Ekmeƒçiƒá was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) from 1978, and a member of its presidency from 2004, and served on five of its specialist committees. He was also a member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1973, the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts from 1993, and the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republika Srpska from 1996. During his career he received the prestigious \\"27th July Award of Bosnia and Herzegovina for Science\\" in 1963, the Yugoslav Order of Labour with Golden Wreath in 1965, the \\"Enlightenment Award\\" in 1972, the NIN Award in 1990 for Stvaranje Jugoslavije 1790‚Äì1918 [Creation of Yugoslavia 1790‚Äì1918], and the Order of St. Sava First Class from the Serbian Orthodox Church, among others. In 2010, he was decorated with the Order of Honor with Golden Rays by Republika Srpska. Ekmeƒçiƒá was a member of the Senate of Republika Srpska. He died after a short illness at a hospital in Belgrade on 29 August 2015 at the age of 86. In February 2019, the president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, proposed that a street in Belgrade be named after Ekmeƒçiƒá. Nationalism and revisionism Ekmeƒçiƒá participated during the Bosnian War as an advisor to the convicted war criminal Radovan Karad≈æiƒá when Karad≈æiƒá was President of Republika Srpska. As part of his connection to Karad≈æiƒá, Ekmeƒçiƒá was also a founder of the radical nationalist Serb Democratic Party (SDS) in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1990, and was one of three academics from the University of Sarajevo who were offered the leadership of the SDS but declined. He was also one of the main ideologues of the SDS. The historian David Bruce MacDonald has highlighted that Ekmeƒçiƒá was one of many Yugoslav academics that \\"went national\\" during the breakup of Yugoslavia, changing his views considerably from his earlier days as a unitarian, and this is reinforced by the scholar Igor ≈†tiks who described Ekmeƒçiƒá as a \\"leading Serb nationalist historian\\", and the academic Aleksandar Pavkoviƒá who asserts that Ekmeƒçiƒá adopted a \\"rather non-rationalist version of Serbism\\". Ekmeƒçiƒá took part in the negotiations of the party with the multi- ethnic, non-nationalist Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the early 1990s. Ivo Kom≈°iƒá was a member of the collective leadership of the SDP and a member of the delegation in the negotiations with the SDS. He recalled that during the negotiations, Ekmeƒçiƒá described the plan of the SDS regarding the formation of a single Belgrade-controlled \\"new Yugoslavia\\" created from all regions claimed by Serbia. The SDP delegates asked Ekmeƒçiƒá if he realised that this plan would lead to war. Ekmeƒçiƒá replied, \\"Of course we know, but this cannot be avoided. No European state was made without bayonets, so this one too will be made with bayonets\\". When the SDS leadership asked him how many lives this would cost, Ekmeƒçiƒá laughed, saying, \\"but it is not much to sacrifice a hundred or two hundred lives for a state. A mere nothing.\\" Before the Bosnian War broke out, Ekmeƒçiƒá promoted Serb victimhood, stating that \\"only the Jews have paid a higher price for their freedom than the Serbs\\". MacDonald has described this narrative as \\"victim-centred propaganda\\" intended to portray one's own nation as a victim of genocide comparable to The Holocaust. According to an analysis of Serbian historiography after 1991 in the journal Contemporary European History by Christian Axboe Nielsen, an associate professor in the School of Culture and Society at Aarhus University in Denmark, Ekmeƒçiƒá was \\"complicit in the weaponisation of history, in particular that of the mass atrocities of the Second World War\\". This trend involved local historians eschewing the standards of international scholarship and concentrating exclusively on sectarian myths, resulting in the production of what has been described by several scholars of the period as \\"pseudohistory\\". Sabrina P. Ramet observes that Ekmeƒçiƒá was part of the revisionist wave in Serbian historiography, to which he contributed a religious flavour by claiming that the Catholic Church was the greatest obstacle to the unification of Yugoslavia in 1918, and casting the Vatican as an enemy of the Serbian nation. According to the Serbian historian Olivera Milosavljeviƒá, Ekmeƒçiƒá believed that the Serbian nation \\"must unite to a higher degree than it is now. The rest of Yugoslavia, which would add Serbian parts from Croatia, as a separate body, is one of the closest solutions\\".

It was formed in 1996, with the name purchased from the now defunct Cult Awareness Network, an organization that provided information on groups it considered to be cults, and that strongly opposed Scientology. The \\"New CAN\\" organization (also known as the Foundation for Religious Freedom) has caused both confusion and controversy among academics and its opponents. Board members of the \\"Old CAN\\" have characterized it as a front group for the Church of Scientology. In December 1997, 60 Minutes profiled the controversy regarding the history of the \\"Old CAN\\" and the \\"New CAN\\", with host Lesley Stahl noting, \\"Now, when you call looking for information about a cult, chances are the person you're talking to is a Scientologist\\". James R. Lewis has described \\"New CAN\\" as \\"a genuine information and networking center on non-traditional religions\\". Margaret Thaler Singer expressed the opinion that any experts the public would be referred to by the \\"New CAN\\" would be cult apologists. Shupe and Darnell noted the \\"New CAN\\" had been able to attract support from donors such as Amazon.com, and by 2000 it was receiving thousands of phone calls per month. The \\"New CAN\\" promotes itself as a champion of human rights and freedom of religion. An August 2007 article on Fox News on the wikipedia Scanner noted \\"a computer linked to the Church of Scientology's network was used to delete references to links between it and [...] the 'Cult Awareness Network'\\" on wikipedia.  History  Bought in bankruptcy court Seal of the United States bankruptcy court. Church of Scientology attorney Steven Hayes bought rights to the Cult Awareness Network assets during its bankruptcy proceedings. The old Cult Awareness Network, which publicly opposed Scientology as well as other groups it considered to be cults, was driven into bankruptcy by litigation costs in 1996. Subsequently, Church of Scientology attorney Steven Hayes appeared in bankruptcy court and won the bidding for what remained of the organization for an amount of $20,000: the name, logo, phone number, office equipment, and judgments that the organization had won but not yet collected. Initially, the Scientologists did not gain access to the CAN files, because of the threat of litigation against the bankruptcy trustee; the files were returned to the board. After Jason Scott sold his $1.875 million judgment to Scientologist Gary Beeny for $25,000, this made Beeny, represented by Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon, CAN's largest creditor. The CAN board then settled with Beeny by turning over the files to him instead of the possibility of being individually liable for the judgement. Individuals who had confided in the \\"Old CAN\\" organization expressed anxiety about their confidential files being sold to other groups, but Moxon stated: \\"People who have committed crimes don't want them to be revealed\\". According to Shupe, Darnell and Moxon, there is evidence that a number of documents in the files were destroyed by unknown persons at CAN in the early to mid-nineties, during the time when CAN and its directors were embroiled in legal battles. Moxon sought out pledges of money from leaders of new religious movements for the confidential files. Moxon believed only 5 percent of the files related to Scientology, and told The Washington Post he had contacted leaders of other new religious movements because he thought that \\"there's smoking guns in the files\\" involving deprogrammers and the \\"Old CAN\\". After being turned over to Beeny, the files were donated to the Foundation for Religious Freedom, who made them available to academic researchers and representatives of various new religious movements for inspection and photocopying. Later they were transferred to the Special Collections section of the University of California library in Santa Barbara. The Foundation for Religious Freedom became the license holder of the CAN name and operates the New CAN today. (Note: Linked location features only the beginning of the article.) It is controlled by a multi-faith board of directors chaired by George Robertson, a self-described Baptist minister. It operates a website and a telephone hotline. The Foundation for Religious Freedom predates the \\"New CAN\\"; in the 1993 closing agreement between the IRS and the Church of Scientology, it was listed as a Scientology-related entity.\\"... and the Foundation for Religious Freedom are Scientology-related entities\\" per Subsection 4 of \\"Section VIII. Definitions\\" of Phillip Lucas New Religious Movements in the 21st Century, p. 235, Routledge, 2004 Reception An article published by the \\"New\\" Cult Awareness Network in 2000 on the group Aum Shinrikyo thanked the Citizen's Commission on Human Rights for their research on psychiatry. In her book Researching New Religious Movements, Arweck wrote that individuals began to fear that Scientology would \\"use CAN's name to cause confusion\\", and these fears solidified with the appearance of \\"New CAN\\". Board members of the \\"Old CAN\\" said the \\"New CAN\\" was nothing but a front group for Scientology. A section of its website relating to the Aum Supreme Truth sect authored by Nick Broadhurst, a New Zealand Scientology spokesman, stated that the real source of the crimes committed by Aum were drugs and psychiatric treatments the cult administered to its members. Broadhurst thanked the Scientology subsidiary Citizen's Commission on Human Rights for usage of material in his report. Scientology is extremely hostile towards psychiatry. The site does not contain any criticism of Scientology, unlike most other sites which claim to provide anti-cult information (other than those dedicated to other specific groups). In the Scientology publication IMPACT, Nr. 72, Scientologist and CAN VP Jean Hornnes explained, \\"We have successfully prevented deprogrammings and we have taken broken families and helped to put them back together by using standard LRH technology on handling PTSness\\".Note: PTS means \\"Potential Trouble Source\\", see Scientology beliefs and practices In January 1997, shortly after the formation of the New CAN, brochures mailed out by the organization described Scientology as a way to \\"increase happiness and improve conditions for oneself and for others\\". Other news sources reported that the (New) Cult Awareness Network was owned by the Church of Scientology. A December 1996 report by CNN had the headline: \\"Group that once criticized Scientologists now owned by one.\\" One Scientologist was quoted in the report as stating that he believed the New Cult Awareness Network would stand for \\"religious freedom\\", however former director Cynthia Kisser was quoted as saying, \\"People are going to believe they're going to talk to an organization that's going to help and understand them in their time of crisis, and in fact, it could be a pipeline of information directly to the group they're most afraid of\\". In 1997, an article in the New York Times characterized the New CAN as an affiliate of the Church of Scientology, stating: \\"now it's in the hands of a Scientologist and proselytizes for the church\\". The New CAN has been accused of giving away the identity of a caller, a concerned mother, to the cult she was inquiring about, which resulted in further damaging the relationship with her daughter. Penn writes in False Dawn that the New Cult Awareness Network is \\"dominated by Scientologists\\". In describing what he refers to as the \\"doublespeak\\" of the (New) Cult Awareness Network, Tuman states that Scientology and CAN utilize the term \\"religious freedom\\" as a hallmark of its defense against critics. Tuman wrote that: \\"What seems to be the case is that the Cult Awareness Network has kept its same name and even its original mission statement, while shifting its concern 180 degrees, from investigating sects to protecting them (from \\"religious intolerance\\"). Tuman concluded his piece entitled: \\"The Strange Case of the Cult Awareness Network\\", by comparing the Web site of the (New) Cult Awareness Network to the 1956 cult film, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. On December 12, 1996, a usenet posting by \\"lah\\" (later reported by TIME magazine to be the account of one Sister Francis Michael of the Heaven's Gate group) in the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology applauded Scientology for their \\"courageous action against the Cult Awareness Network\\", which she accused of \\"promoting all sort of lies (including) cult activities.\\" This email was also reported on, and the full-text of the email was displayed, in an article called \\"The business of cults\\", in 2000. The subject of the email, \\"Thanks for Actions Against CAN\\", and contained the text, \\"Here's a round of applause to the Church of Scientology for their courageous action against the Cult Awareness Network.\\" In December 1997, 60 Minutes profiled the new management of the Cult Awareness Network, in a piece hosted by Lesley Stahl, entitled: \\"CAN: The Cult Awareness Network\\". 60 Minutes referred to the (Old) Cult Awareness Network as a comprehensive resource, stating it was \\"for 20 years the nation's best-known resource for information and advice about groups it considered dangerous.\\" The current influence by the Church of Scientology was investigated, and Stahl commented in a voice-over: \\"Now, when you call looking for information about a cult, chances are the person you're talking to is a Scientologist.\\" The Church of Scientology's Fair Game policy was described by Stahl; examples of the Fair Game policy were given on-camera from people including Stacy Brooks, as well as a private investigator hired by Kendrick Moxon. Moxon and Church president Heber Jentzsch also gave an interview, during which Jentzsch compared CAN to the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazi Party. The Time Magazine article \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\" was also cited as a reference in the report. The piece concluded by displaying some of the pamphlets distributed by the (New) Cult Awareness Network, which included one called \\"Facts about Deprogramming\\" and another entitled \\"Fact vs. Fiction: Scientology: the inside story at last\\".

History Originally aimed at the influx of Irish immigrants to the new country, the New Zealand Tablet was founded by the first Bishop of Dunedin, Patrick Moran. Moran was noted as a strong-minded and literate speaker and the paper gave him the opportunity to voice his views on religion, the church, and politics - especially the latter. Moran was noted for his opposition to the secularisation of education (a policy of the New Zealand government), and strongly vocal on the issue of Irish nationalism, and used the paper as a pulpit from which to write on both subjects.Papers Past New Zealand Tablet page. Moran died in 1895, and during the ten years which followed - under the editorship of Henry Cleary - the paper adopted a more gentle approach to politics. James Kelly, editor from 1917 to 1931, adopted a line closer to Moran's ‚Äî so much so that Cleary founded an opposition Catholic journal, The Month, in 1918. Kelly's editorship raised hackles with its pro- Irish republican leanings, especially in the years around and immediately after World War I. Eventually, Kelly was forced to resign from the paper's editorship at the beginning of the 1930s.The Tablet remained an important means of communication within the New Zealand Catholic community, but after Kelly's time maintained a less outspoken approach. Despite this, it remained a political force, especially under the editorship of John Patrick Kennedy from 1967 to 1989. Kennedy was an astute political analyst and lively writer.Life: The Turbulent Seventies During his career as editor of Tablet, he also developed a close friendship with Prime Minister Rob Muldoon and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children president Des Dalgety, who all shared socially conservative views on moral and social issues.Editor, \\"Doctors for Life growing,\\" The Tablet, 18 April 1984, 1.

It is prominently used with children who will be adopted, and older adults as part of reminiscence therapies. Life story books are often incorporated into this work to give a visual aid and reminder of important events or feelings. Origins Life story work as a concept has dated back to at least the 1960s, possibly further. The application of the concept to children in foster care and adoption was discussed in academia from the early 1980s onward. Life story work is well documented in the UK and Australia and has been incorporated into UK Adoption legislation. More recently it has been used in Eastern Europe. Preparing and planning Social workers should take the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that children who are expected to be adopted or to be in long term care have a life story book. Social workers often hold the most factual information about the child's background and reasons for becoming Looked After or Adopted and it is important that they provide this information for use in the life story work. Day-to-day carers such as; Foster Carers, Residential Support Workers or Adoptive Parents can offer the best informal life story work. They have the information about the day-to-day events in the child's life, their milestones and achievements. Birth Parents are a critical part of the life story work with adopted children as they can offer information to construct a family tree and provide pictures or descriptions of family members. Some suggest that life story work can be completed by any adult who is able and willing to spend time with the child and build a trusting relationship. However, some feel that some professionals such as student social workers, trainees and foster carers should not be encouraged to complete the life story work as they may not have the experience, training or ability to support the child with life story work over a long enough period of time. The person's needs must be taken into account regarding the gender, ethnicity, religion or culture of the adult assisting with the life story work. Techniques Life story books Life story books have been a part of adoption social workers' practice for over 30 years; though the quality of them has varied. It should take around 12 months to complete it though it may need to be updated as the child's understanding develops. Life story work is distinct from life story books, the process of life story work is to assist the person to understand and internalise the feelings associated with their past. However, a life story book does not need to involve the person and can be done by others, this is especially the case when done by social workers before placing a child for adoption. Rees & Goldberg state that a life story book should not include professional reports, later life letters, structured chronology (though this could be recorded in another, more child friendly, format), photo album and should not be an extension of the foster carer's memory book. However, life story books can often be seen as complementary or as an end product to life story work. A life story book is a system of recording information to answer the questions the participant may have in the future. It is an overview of a person's life to help them recall memories and understand their past. A child who does not fully understand their history is at risk of developing an imagined story of fictional family members leading to a misplaced sense of identity as they mature. Often, life story books are written from the perspective of the Past-Present though it has been suggested that writing it in this way causes the child anxiety as past issues may be too painful to come to terms with. Therefore, it has been suggested that a new approach: ‚ÄòPresent ‚Äì Past ‚Äì Present ‚Äì Future‚Äô allows the child to feel that their life with their current family is secure and symbolically encourages the child to feel contained by their family. Interactive approach It has been identified that ICT can assist with the presentation of life story work such as amending colour schemes to make it personal to the individual, and correcting spelling or grammatical errors. Hardware peripherals such as scanners, digital cameras and printers are also useful. Computer programmes have been developed to complete life story work with children in a way which they feel comfortable and do not find threatening.  Digital life story work  The importance of digital technologies and digital media in the lives of children and young people has seen a growth in interest of the ability of these technologies to support self-reflection and build narrative coherence. In seeking to make the benefits of conventional life story work accessible to adolescents, Hammond and CooperHammond, S. P. & Cooper, N. J. (2013) Digital life story work: Using technology to help young people make sense of their experiences. London: BAAF. integrate the ideas of narrative psychology and build upon established approaches of undertaking life story work with younger children. Recognising that adolescents communicate differently than younger children, Hammond and Cooper incorporate a range of accessible digital technologies to provide interactive and practical activities which aim to support practitioners to empower adolescents to take the lead in the creation of, and reflection upon, their own autobiographical narratives. Story- telling Creating stories for children that can create a link between their lives and behaviour and that of a fiction character can develop their understanding of why they think and feel the way they do. Service user groups Adoption The Children's Rights Director in England found that 71% of adopted children thought it was important to know about their lives before adoption. Specific questions that these children wanted answers to included why they were adopted and why they could not stay with birth families. The Adoption and Children Act 2002 outlines the Local Authorities' and Adoption Agencies' expectations to provide information regarding individual's history upon request. Guidance relating to this Act specifically mentions Life Story Work to help them 'explore and understand their early history and life before their adoption'. Fostering Some Local Authorities in the UK have developed procedures which outline the need for all children who are Looked After to have life story work completed with them; usually in conjunction with the social worker and foster carer. Much of the foster carer's role is to collect items for the child's memory box or book and to encourage the child to participate. Dementia Life story work is used for people with dementia to support them to be able to tell the story of their life and to create visual tools to help their memories of past events. Present and future goals or plans should be identified. It has also been found to be beneficial as a therapeutic tool for family members to assist in reviewing the person's life and enabling them to remember the person prior to the onset of dementia. Staff and carers of the person may also find it a useful tool to help them better care for a person. Furthermore, research shows that families feel reassured about staff care after life story work has been completed. It was also identified by staff to be a fun and interesting activity to do with dementia patients. Life story work should identify a person's achievements throughout life so this can allow the person with dementia to feel proud of themselves. Life story work has been linked to person centred/individualised care of people with dementia and national UK guidelines make particular reference to staff being able to learn about individuals' life stories. Learning disabilities An Australian study of ex-prisoners with 'intellectual' disabilities suggested that life story work may be beneficial to allow this group of people to better communicate their experiences. It has also been identified as a tool to promoting self-advocacy. Criticism of life story work Research conducted within in-patient older adult mental health wards found that there was sometimes a shortage of qualified staff to complete the work and a reluctance to get involved due to other commitments and responsibilities. There were also limits to the amount of time they had available to complete the work and access to resources such as computers and scanners was identified as a problem.

Main characters \\"The Team\\" Artemis, Robin, Kid Flash, Superboy, Miss Martian, and Aqualad. =Founding Members= The initial six main characters were chosen by the producers, from a list of potential candidates of 50 to 60 DC Comics teenage superheroes. The criteria consisted of age, powers, personality, cultural icon status, and dynamics. An additional regular, Zatanna, was introduced partway through the first season, and Rocket was added at the end of the first season. * Dick Grayson/Nightwing/Robin (voiced by Jesse McCartney) - Designation: B01. Known as Robin throughout Season 1; Grayson was, though only thirteen, the most experienced member of the team. He does not possess any superpowers, however, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, tactician, and a technological genius. He has a flippant personality, and can be heard laughing in combat or when sneaking up on villains in order to unnerve and startle them. He repeatedly plays with the English language, particularly with words which cease to function without prefixes, such as \\"disaster\\" (\\"aster\\"), \\"overwhelmed\\" (\\"whelmed\\"), and \\"distraught\\" (\\"traught\\"). Batman had forbidden Robin from revealing his secret identity to the team, though Kid Flash was aware of it. Robin acts as team leader when Aqualad is unable to. Aqualad sees Robin as reluctant to lead the team, feeling that he doesn't know enough. \\"Eventually he shows that he is a natural born leader. And that's just part of what you'll see from Dick Grayson\\". In Season 2 (set five years later in the future), Dick has assumed the identity of Nightwing while Tim Drake has assumed the mantle of Robin. Nightwing remains on the team as their leader and trainer, assigning and participating in missions. Dick encourages Tim to have confidence in his leadership skills, but the latter is apprehensive about doing so. After \\"Endgame\\", Dick decides to take a leave of absence after Wally's sacrifice and leaves Barbara in charge if they need any help. Between Seasons 2 and 3, he's become leader of his own team alongside Oracle; later recruiting Tigress, Superboy, and Black Lightning, but is also secretly a member of the Anti-Light to use the Light's methods against them alongside Batman and the Justice League and Team leaders. During the season, Dick still has trouble moving on following Wally's death, but later manages to finally come to terms and accept his death and later rejoins the Team. * Kaldur'ahm/Aquaman/Aqualad (voiced by Khary Payton) ‚Äì Designation: B02; later 27. In Season 1, Kaldur'ahm (or \\"Kaldur\\" for short) was the sixteen-year-old leader of the team. His powers, channeled through the tattoos on his arms, are a mixture of Atlantean sorcery and science. He displays super strength, durability, as well as the ability to breathe and speak underwater, typical of Atlanteans. He also possesses the ability to form hard water constructs through the use of his Atlantean water bearers and to generate electricity. He was selected as the initial leader for the Team, but stated that he did not want to remain leader and wished to turn over leadership to Robin when he was ready, saying that it was his destiny to lead this team. In Season 2 (set five years in the future), Aqualad is Nightwing's mole in his father Black Manta's organization in order to infiltrate the Light and discover who their partner is. His \\"defection\\" is based upon his being the son of Black Manta (which Aquaman covered up) as well as the death of Tula in an earlier Team mission. When Miss Martian fights Aqualad later, her psychic abilities caused her to learn about Aqualad and Tigress' true mission with the psychic attack leaving Aqualad in an apparently-catatonic state. His body was carried away by Tigress. But soon in order to cure his son (thanks to Tigress' suggestion), Deathstroke and Tigress capture Miss Martian and manage to restore him. During the summit, he and Tigress were revealed to be the spies and after their mission is complete, Aqualad returns to his post as leader once again. By 2018, Kaldur has become Aquaman II and is co-leader of the Justice League along with Wonder Woman. Kaldur is secretly a member of the Anti-Light, consisting of Batman, Wonder Woman, Nightwing, Miss Martian, Oracle and Robin as they plan to use the Light's methods against them which they keep secret from the rest of the League and Team. However, by the end of the season, following the Anti-Light's exposure, both Kaldur and Wonder Woman willingly step down and appoint Black Lightning as the Justice League's newest leader. * Wally West/Kid Flash (voiced by Jason Spisak) ‚Äì Designation: B03. During Season 1, Kid Flash is the team's fifteen-year-old speedster. He has enhanced speed, although he has not fully mastered his abilities, often falling down while running at high speeds due to a misstep. Kid Flash cannot vibrate his molecules through solid objects like the Flash and gets a bloody nose if he attempts to. He is a flirt, beginning with M'gann and extending to any woman he comes into contact with. Kid Flash and Robin know each other outside the team, even knowing each other's secret identities. Wally likes to collect souvenirs from the team's missions, such as T. O. Morrow's robotic eye and Cheshire's mask. Ava Dordi, of the Palo Alto Voice notes that Jason Spisak \\"captures the Lighthearted essence of Kid Flash well\\". In Season 2 (set five years in the future), Kid Flash has given up the superhero life and is in a relationship with Artemis with the two living and attending college together. Wally does however, assume the guise of Kid Flash once again during the crisis involving Neutron wherein he assists Impulse and the two Flashes (Jay Garrick and Barry Allen) with containing a major explosion. It is revealed that Wally was aware of Nightwing's plan to fake Artemis's death so she could be placed in deep cover alongside Aqualad. He returns to the mission during \\"Bloodlines\\" to stop Neutron and rejoins the team during \\"Summit\\". During \\"Endgame\\", he, along with The Flash and Impulse manage to control the Magnetic Field Disruptor but due to his slower speed, the chrysalis energy siphons off onto him, causing him to disappear. * Kon-El/Conner Kent/Superboy (voiced by Nolan North) ‚Äì Designation: B04. Superboy is introduced as a sixteen-week-old clone of Superman (later revealed to be a hybrid clone of Superman and Lex Luthor) created by Project Cadmus. Although he does not have all of Superman's abilities, he has super strength, invulnerability, enhanced hearing, and later: infrared vision. Lex Luthor later gave Superboy a set of patches which suppresses Superboy's human DNA, giving him his full Kryptonian abilities, similar to those of Superman's; however they only last for typically an hour, and his aggression increases as well. Superboy is typically sullen, ill- tempered, grumpy, and hates being told what to do. His nonexistent relationship with Superman only adds to this anger. He and Miss Martian also begin to develop strong and mutual romantic feelings for each other. They become couple when they go under cover in Belle Reve together and attempt to keep their romance a secret until everyone eventually finds out. Five years after the events of Season 1, Superboy has remained on with the Team and his formerly apprehensive relationship with Superman has greatly improved, with Superman now referring to him as a brother. Conner is more in control of his anger, resourceful and more familiar with alien technology. Superboy has also recently ended his and Miss Martian's relationship due to M'gann using her telepathic powers to violently extract information from enemies; even more so, she tried to tamper with his mind to try and make him forget that he was upset with her. Despite their break up, they still remain very much in love with each other and while they attempt to ignore and hide their feelings, they finally work on restoring their relationship by the end of the season. In Season 3, set two years later, Conner and M'gann have fully mended their relationship and they now live together in Happy Harbor. Conner proposes to M'gann in the premiere and they become engaged. Superboy joins Nightwing's team and works on training the new young heroes alongside Nightwing, Tigress and Black Lightning, but still retains his place on the Team while at the same time, Superboy is beginning to feel the pressure to step up in Superman's absence. By the end of the season, Superboy reveals himself as Superman's clone, becomes a public hero and joins the Outsiders. Greg Weisman notes that Nolan North provides \\"good separation\\" between the dual roles he portrays as Superman and Superboy. * Megan Morse/M'gann M'orzz/Miss Martian (voiced by Danica McKellar) ‚Äì Designation: B05. Miss Martian is Martian Manhunter's teenage (by Martian standards, though she is in her 40s in earth years) niece, as well as being an inexperienced superhero. As a Martian, she has telekinesis, telepathy, and flight. Additionally, she can shape-shift to a limited extent. She has stated that she cannot become intangible as her uncle can, implying that this is an advanced skill; but by Season 2, she had learned this power. In later episodes, Martian Manhunter discovers that her raw abilities, particularly in terms of telepathy and mind control, are potentially greater than his own. She pilots her own bio-ship, which transports the team and can become camouflaged with the surrounding area. She is kind and optimistic, but has a naive streak born of having learned about life on Earth through television shows. In line with this, she makes regular use of the catchphrase \\"Hello, Megan!\\" when suddenly realizing something. She becomes romantically involved with Superboy while working undercover with him in Belle Reve.

Born in a croft in Aberdeenshire, he was forcibly taken to North America at an early age, but succeeded in returning to Scotland where he eventually became a well-known character in 18th century Edinburgh. He adopted the pseudonym \\"Indian Peter\\" due to his time spent with native Americans and his self-exploitation of this in an autobiography and by touring Scotland and England in the guise of a \\"Red Indian\\". Early life Williamson was born the son of James Williamson in a croft in Hirnlay near Aboyne. He described his parents as \\"reputable though not rich\\" and at an early age was sent to live with a maiden aunt in Aberdeen.J K Gillon, Eccentric Edinburgh, Moubray House, Edinburgh 1990, p.30 Though little acknowledged in history, there was in those days a thriving trade in stolen children and others. Those engaged in kidnapping were called \\"spirits\\", and many of those who were spirited away were taken to North America.America at 1750: A Social Portrait, pp. 35-36, by Richard HofstadterA History of the United States: A century of colonial history, 1660-1760, pp. 368-369, by Edward Channing In January 1743, Williamson fell victim to the trade when he was kidnapped while playing on the quay at Aberdeen.D Daiches, Edinburgh, Hamish Hamilton, London 1978, p.139 His autobiography gives his age as eight at the time. Some of the Aberdeen bailies were suspected of colluding with the traffickers; an estimated 600 children disappeared from the port when the trade was at its height between 1740 and 1746. The Plantation Williamson was taken to Philadelphia and sold for ¬£16 as an indentured servant for a period of seven years to a fellow Scot, Hugh Wilson. Wilson had himself been kidnapped as a boy and sold into indentured servitude, but, like many indentured servants, had earned his freedom. He may have therefore sympathised with Peter's situation. Williamson said Wilson treated him kindly, and when the latter died in 1750, just before the end of the indenture, he bequeathed the boy ¬£120 plus his best horse and saddle and all his clothes. This helped bring about a change in Peter's fortunes. Continuing life in America At the age of 24, Williamson married the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner and was given a dowry of 200 acres of land close to the frontier of Pennsylvania, where he settled down to life as a farmer. On the night of 2 October 1754 his farm was attacked by Cherokee Indians and he was taken prisoner. The house was plundered and burned to the ground. Williamson related that he was forced to march many miles acting as a pack-mule for the Cherokees and that, whilst with them, he witnessed many murders and scalpings. After several months he escaped and made his way back to his father-in-law's home, where he learnt that his wife had died in his absence. He was called before the State Assembly in Philadelphia to pass on any information he had acquired during his captivity. Whilst there, he enlisted in an army regiment raised to combat in the French and Indian War. In the following two years he rose to the rank of lieutenant. Third capture/return to Scotland Title page of French and Indian Cruelty In a now repeating pattern he was captured by French troops and marched to Quebec. He was then granted status as an \\"exchange prisoner\\" and sent on a ship to Plymouth in England where he arrived in November 1756. Having a damaged left hand from being wounded, he was discharged from the army as unfit and given a small gratuity of six shillings to help him. He set off to walk from Plymouth back to Aberdeen (almost exactly 1000km). Arriving penniless in York his stories aroused the interest of some \\"honourable and influential men\\" who encouraged him to write about his exploits. With their backing he published his account under the title French and Indian Cruelty, exemplified in the Life and various Vicissitudes of Fortune of Peter Williamson, who was carried off from Aberdeen in his Infancy and sold as a slave in Pennsylvania. A thousand copies of the book were sold, earning Williamson a profit of ¬£30, which allowed him to continue his journey to Scotland in comparative ease. Return to Scotland As he travelled northwards, Williamson took to dressing as a \\"Red Indian\\" and giving displays of Indian life, e.g. demonstrating war-cries and dancing, to help sell further copies of his book which he carried around with him. In June 1758 he finally returned to Aberdeen, some 15 years after his kidnapping. While he was selling copies of his book in Aberdeen, the authorities charged Williamson with libel in relation to his accusations of their involvement in his original kidnapping. Since the same magistrates he was accusing were also judging him, a guilty verdict was perhaps inevitable. Surplus copies of his book were seized and burned publicly at the mercat cross by the common hangman. Williamson was made to sign a statement stating that his claims were false, fined five shillings and banished from Aberdeen as a vagrant. Edinburgh Williamson then headed for Edinburgh where he settled for the remainder of his life. Here he opened a coffee house under Parliament House which became a favourite resort of Edinburgh lawyers and their clients. Robert Fergusson devoted a verse of his poem The Rising of the Session to this popular establishment: This vacance [vacation] is a heavy doom On Indian Peter's coffee-room For a' his china pigs are toom [bottles are empty] Nor do we see In wine the soukar biskets soom [sugar biscuits swim] As light's a fleeR Chambers, Traditions of Edinburgh, W & R Chambers Ltd., Edinburgh 1947, p.114 Having read his book, some of the lawyers encouraged him to sue the Aberdeen magistrates. The case was heard in the Court of Session in Edinburgh and the judges found unanimously in Williamson's favour. The Provost of Aberdeen, four bailies and the Dean of Guild were forced to pay him ¬£100 in compensation. Emboldened by this success, Williamson decided further to sue Bailie William Fordyce and others, whom he believed were personally responsible for his kidnapping. The case went before James Forbes, Sheriff-Substitute of Aberdeenshire, acting as arbiter. It seems that the defendants wined and dined Forbes generously ahead of his final deliberations and he exonerated them. The decree was read out at the mercat cross the next day. However, the case was referred to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and after Williamson produced hard evidence of the defendants' involvement, the Court reversed the Sheriff- Substitute's decision in December 1763. Williamson was awarded ¬£200 damages plus 100 guineas legal costs. Fame and fortune Williamson's new-found wealth enabled him to open a tavern in Parliament Close bearing a sign worded, Peter Williamson, Vintner From The Other World, in allusion to his time in North America. A wooden figure of him in Delaware Indian costume stood at the head of the close to advertise its location. In 1769 Williamson opened a printing shop in the Luckenbooths between St Giles High Kirk and the north side of the Royal Mile. He taught himself the craft of printing using a portable press purchased in London. He then invented his own portable printing press and travelled to exhibitions and fairs to promote his new product. He also invented waterproof ink for stamping linen which withstood both boiling and bleaching. In 1773 Williamson compiled the first Edinburgh street directory in conjunction with his idea of setting up a regular postal service in the city. This comprised a list of streets and closes with the addresses of lawyers, merchants, officials and other notable gentlemen. Addresses of shops and taverns were also included, thereby not only hugely aiding navigation in the city but creating what is now a very valuable historical source. The Directory cost one shilling and was published regularly with relevant updates until 1796. In 1776 he launched a weekly magazine, The Scots Spy or Critical Observer but this ran only from 8 March until 30 August 1776. It was issued each Friday and contained articles and local gossip. He tried to revive this in 1777 under the title The New Scots Spy but this second venture ran only from 29 August until 14 November 1777. In 1777 he married Jean the daughter of John Wilson, a bookseller in Edinburgh. They divorced in 1788. The National Portrait Gallery in London has a print which appeared in The Grand Magazine in June 1759 showing Williamson in full \\"Delaware Indian\\" dress with tomahawk and scalping knife. The caricaturist John Kay drew him in Indian costume some time around 1768 and this drawing appeared in the preface of later editions of Williamson's autobiography. It also appears as portrait No.128 in Kay's \\"Original Portraits\\", a collection of drawings of Edinburgh characters of the time. Postal service 1774 entire wrapper posted in Peter Williamson's postal service with \\"E. Penny Post Not Paid\\" circular handstamp in black ink on the reverse The Mercat Cross, Edinburgh (reconstructed 1885) Some time before 1774 Williamson introduced a postal service in Edinburgh. This is evidenced in his Edinburgh Directory of that year, where he draws the public's attention to the fact that \\"the publisher\\" (i.e. himself) is willing to dispatch letters and packages up to 3 pounds in weight to any place within one mile of the city's mercat cross, as well as to properties in North and South Leith. The service was run from his premises in the Luckenbooths every hour on the hour and cost one penny. Seventeen local shopkeepers spread throughout the city were paid to receive the letters, thus effectively creating the first \\"post offices\\". Four uniformed postmen were employed to deliver from the Luckenbooths to the shops. Their hats were emblazoned with the words \\"Penny Post\\" and they were numbered 1, 4, 8 and 16 (giving the impression that the business was bigger than it was). The service was the first regular and continuous postal service in Scotland, and ran under Williamson's control for 30 years. In 1793, it was integrated into the General Post Office and Williamson received ¬£25 for the goodwill of the business and a pension of 25 shillings per year. The poet Robert Fergusson again referred to Williamson in Codicile to Robert Fergusson's Last Will: To Williamson, and his resetters Dispersing of the burial letters That they may pass with little cost Fleet on the wings of penny-post Death In his final years Williamson returned to running a tavern, this time in the Lawnmarket, where he seems to have become an alcoholic. He died in January 1799, probably of liver disease. He was buried in the Old Calton Burial Ground in Edinburgh, 15 metres northeast of the Political Martyrs' Monument. Whilst the grave is unmarked, he is at least commemorated today by tour guides. His obituary in \\"The Scots Magazine\\" appeared soon after and praised Williamson and his various fortunes, good and bad.Scotsman (newspaper) 10 April 2017 His Street Directory was taken over in 1800 by Thomas Aitchison who had a printworks on Fleshmarket Close in the old Town.Edinburgh Street Directory 1810 Veracity of Indian captivity narrative The veracity of Williamson's captivity story was challenged almost as soon as it was first printed, and the work has always been seen as suspect among professional historians. In a 1964 article for the quarterly journal Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies, J. Bennett Nolan qualified Williamson as \\"one of the greatest liars who ever lived.\\"Nolan, J. Bennett. \\"Peter Williamson in America, a Colonial Odyssey\\". Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies 31.1 (1964) Whilst Bennett's statement may be slightly harsh, recent scholarship suggests that large parts of Williamson's narrative are in fact a fabrication; including possibly his marriage, his age at the time of his first kidnapping from Aberdeen, and most significantly his capture by Native Americans. Whilst Williamson's tale is \\"not to be trusted as an account of Indian Captivity,\\" it is an interesting example of the popular literature genre Timothy J. Shannon has called \\"narratives of unfortunates.\\" It is also a good example of anti-French propaganda during the Seven Years' War, and like Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, sheds light on the colonial construction and representation of native peoples.Shannon, Timothy J. \\"King of the Indians: The Hard Fate and Curious Career of Peter Williamson\\".

The music was written by Bernie Miller, with lyrics added later by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It was popularised with a recording by the quartet of the American saxophonist and composer Gerry Mulligan, on the 1952 album of the same name, which also featured Chet Baker on trumpet. Despite this association, the piece was actually composed, as aforementioned, by a slightly unsung composer Bernie Miller, who also wrote the tune \\"Loaded\\" which was also covered by Chet Baker and saxophonist Stan Getz (to name a few). The tune was a popular choice for musicians jamming at the time, though information about the composer (\\"Bernie\\" Miller) himself is scarce, all that people really know of him is that he was a piano player from Washington DC. Mulligan speculated that by the time he had discovered any of Bernie's tunes, Bernie was dead. Later on in Mulligan's life, he took the same changes but invented a new melody to fit over the piece, entitling it 'Idle Gossip'. Composition The song is typically played in D minor, and has a 32 bar AABA structure. Harmonically, it starts on the root minor chord, then travels to form a dominant on the minor 6th of the D (Bb dominant 7th functions as the dominant of F minor 7th which is the minor 3 chord) . This is what gives the A section of this piece a slightly blues-orientated tonality, as the dominant 7th of the Bb dominant is an Ab, the b5 of the root minor chord, being the definitive note of a blues scale. It then moves down a semitone to the dominant 5th of the root minor, preparing to go back to the root minor. This repeats for the second A section, although instead of the minor 2-5 back into D minor, there is a major 2-5-1 into Bb Major (leading to the B section.) The B section of the piece is a standard 1-6-2-5 in Bb repeating 3 times, then leading to a Bb dominant, and a minor 2-5 back into the root minor. The A section then repeats once to lead back to the start. The melody of the A section is primarily chromatic and conjunct, except the quaver length four note arpeggios at the end of each second bar. The melody of the B section is far less chromatic but still moves in a predominantly conjunct style.

It is operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) and is part of the FrontRunner South extension. Description The station is located at 12997 South FrontRunner Boulevard and is accessed from I-15 by way of the I-15/12300 South (SR-71) interchange. The station is located on the east side of FrontRunner Boulevard. The station can therefore be accessed from either 12300 South (on the north) or 13490 South (on the southeast). The station has a Park and Ride two-level parking garage with 600 parking spaces available. This parking garage is one of only two operated by UTA (the other is at the Jordan Valley TRAX Station) and, as of March 21, 2013, the cost for parking the garage is $1 per day or $15 per month. The parking fees help offset the additional cost of maintaining the parking garages over regular parking lots. The station also has what signs indicate is a \\"Kiss and Ride\\" lot which allows the driver to remain with the vehicle while a passenger is dropped off or pickup at the station. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The station opened, along with the rest of FrontRunner South, on December 10, 2012 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, as well as all fixed route buses, are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities. Since not all the FrontRunner passenger cars are wheelchair accessible, signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the passenger cars clearly indicate accessibility options. In addition, each train has one or more Train Hosts available to provide assistance as may be needed, including the placement of ramps for wheelchair boarding. In accordance with the Utah Clean Air Act and UTA ordinance, \\"smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and FrontRunner stations\\". History The Draper (or Draper/Bluffdale, as it was called in the initial planning stages) and Vineyard stations were originally not planned to be completed for the initial opening of FrontRunner South, but rather as infill stations to be built at a later date. However, plans changed and the Draper Station was eventually completed in time for the opening of FrontRunner South, while the Vineyard Station is still planned for the future. UTA originally hoped to have the Draper Station further south on the line, but of the four options considered, the current location was chosen as best overall. One of the reasons for this choice was that one of the more preferred locations (near Bangerter Highway [SR-154]) was also in the middle of a Native American archaeological site. While the station itself only occupies about 10 acres, the accompanying transit-oriented development called Vista Station (similar to Station Park, which is adjacent to the Farmington Station) will occupy about . Development of Vista Station is expected to begin in 2014. FrontRunner On weekdays the FrontRunner has about twenty-three round trips between Ogden and Provo (through Salt Lake City) and about five more round trips between Ogden and Downtown Salt Lake City. On Saturdays there are only nineteen round trips between Ogden and Provo. Trains run hourly from about 4:30 am to just after midnight on weekdays (with additional half-hour runs for the morning and evening commutes). Saturdays have hourly runs from about 6:00 am to 2:30 am Sunday morning. As of August 2013 the FrontRunner does not run on Sundays or holidays. Each weekday, service is extended to Pleasant View station with two trains picking up (no dropping off) passengers early in the morning and two more trains picking up and dropping off passengers in the evening. Train schedule On weekdays the first northbound FrontRunner train (to the Ogden Intermodal Transit Center) leaves the Draper station at about 5:30 am and the first southbound train (to the Provo station) also leaves at about 5:30 am. The last northbound train leaves at 10:55 pm and the last southbound train leave at 12:13 am (early the next morning). The first, last, and only trains that go as far north as the Pleasant View station leave at 4:55 pm and 5:55 pm. On Saturdays the first southbound train leaves at about 6:30 am and the first northbound train leaves at about 8:30 am. The last southbound train leaves at 12:36 am (early Sunday morning) and the last northbound train leaves at 1:55 am (early Sunday morning). However, the last northbound train only goes as far north as the North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe station; the last train to the Ogden Intermodal Transit Center leaves at 11:25 pm.

Foundation Family & Life were founded out of a split with the Irish branch of Human Life International in September 1996 by David Manly (1996-present), Peter Scully (1996-2001) and three other individuals over alleged interference by its American headquarters. HLI then sought an injunction in the High Court to seize the offices in Family and Life's headquarters. In the end, the case was settled out of court, the offices were kept and a number of directors received an undisclosed sum from Human Life International. Work According to its website, Family & Life seeks to establish what it calls a 'Culture of Life'. The group views itself as supporting projects which promote the sanctity of all human life. Family & Life is also a supporter of the institution of marriage as the basis of family life, upholding a social conservative rather than a social liberal view of society. They say they provide support for pregnant women, although this excludes abortion counselling, and that they help children in vulnerable situations. Family & Life fundraises direct from supporters in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It says it is not affiliated to any other organisation and does not receive state, organizational or corporate funding or engage in street collections, lotteries or the for-profit sale of goods. It is a non-profit organisation registered in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The organisation focuses on, and develops educational and research approaches to communicate its mission. In 2013, they took 10 Irish politicians to New York City and Washington DC on an anti-abortion fact finding missing. These were James Bannon, Terence Flanagan, Peter Mathews, Mattie McGrath, John O‚ÄôMahony, Jim Walsh, Paul Bradford, Fidelma Healy Eames, Brian √ì Domhnaill and Paschal Mooney. They also brought Northern politicians Paul Givan, Pat Ramsey and Ian Paisley Jr. Fine Gael TD Jim Daly called for inquiry into this trip, and highlighted how some of their fundraising tactics were causing distress to elderly people. SIPO ruled that this did not count as a political donation that the politicians had to declare. Family & Life are registered with SIPO to receive donations for political purposes., but they were not required by law to be registered at the time of the trip, Alignment Initially, the new organisation, continuing from the stance of HLI, aligned itself with the Youth Defence wing of the pro- life movement in Ireland. A co-founder of Family & Life, Peter Scully was PRO for Youth Defence in 1992. However, during the 2002 abortion referendum, it supported the proposals of the Fianna F√°il government against abortion in Ireland. Youth Defence opposed it, claiming that it did not go far enough in protecting the unborn. Citizens' Assembly In 2017, they were selected as one of the groups to present to the Citizens' Assembly which is current discussing Ireland's abortion laws. In their presentation, they criticised the presence from British Pregnancy Advisory Service. The chair, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, defended their inclusion on the grounds that the members of the citizens assembly wanted them included. Other campaigns Divorce In 1995, there was a referendum on whether to allow divorce. Human Life International (Ireland), along with Family and Life co-founder Peter Scully, campaigned against the legalisation of divorce. It was alleged that they received large amounts of free material and funding from the United States and their US parent organisation Human Life International.} Same-sex marriage In 2005 the Irish government held hearings about changing the constitutional definition of the family. Family & Life provided written and oral submissions opposed to any legal recognition of same-sex marriage, calling it an \\"oxymoron\\", with founder David Manly claiming it could not exist. The group also highlighted the falling birth rate in Europe. Dr Tom Finnegan, legal advisor to Family and Life, was advisor to Mothers and Fathers Matter, the main campaign group against the 2015 Irish referendum on same sex marriage. Tom Finnegan was a parliamentary assistant to Senator R√≥n√°n Mullen.

Amlodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blocker used as an antihypertensive and antianginal agent. Levamlodipine is currently marketed in Russia under the brand name EsCordi Cor (Actavis Pharma), in Brazil under the brand name Novanlo (Biolab Sanus) and in India under the trade names Eslo (Zuventus Healthcare Ltd.), Asomex (Emcure Pharmaceutical Ltd.), and Espin (Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd.).  Mechanism of action  Amlodipine blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium into the vascular and cardiac smooth muscles resulting in vasodilation and hence a fall in blood pressure. Levamlodipine is an allosteric modulator and acts on the L-type of calcium channels. Receptor binding studies have shown that out of the two forms only the (S)-enantiomer of amlodipine binds to and blocks L-type calcium channels whereas the (R)-enantiomer has no activity on these channels. The precise mechanisms by which levamlodipine relieves angina have not been fully explored, but are thought to include the following: * Decreases peripheral resistance by arteriolar vasodilatation leading to the reduction in oxygen requirement and energy consumption of cardiac smooth muscles. * Decreases coronary vascular resistance and can lead to an increase in coronary blood flow.  Pharmacokinetics and metabolism  Administration of levamlodipine (2.5 mg) as a single dose gives maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 8.3 to 9.3 ng/mL in 2 to 3 hrs (Tmax). It is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Levamlodipine shows approximately 93% plasma protein binding in hypertensive patients. The mean AUC0‚Äìt value (t = 48 hrs) of levamlodipine tablets (2.5 mg) is . The plasma elimination half-life of levamlodipine has been found to be .  Clinical experience  Various clinical studies have shown that levamlodipine has more selectivity and better efficacy than (R)-amlodipine. In pooled data, from three comparative studies conducted in 200 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, 2.5 mg of levamlodipine was found to be equivalent in its blood pressure lowering efficacy to 5 mg of amlodipine. The average reduction in systolic BP was 19¬±3 vs 19¬±4, 20¬±2 vs 19¬±3 and 20¬±2 vs 19¬±3 mm of Hg recorded in standing, supine and sitting position respectively for levamlodipine compared to racemic amlodipine. The studies also reported a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels with levamlodipine, which was not seen with amlodipine. Efficacy and safety of levamlodipine (2.5 mg, once daily) has been evaluated in the patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Levamlodipine effectively reduced the systolic BP (mean reduction 22¬±14 mm of Hg) in all grades of ISH. After 28 days of the treatment, overall responder rate was 73%. It significantly reduced the systolic and diastolic BP within 4 weeks with a responder rate of 96.5%. Elderly hypertensives with diabetes mellitus exhibits higher response to levamlodipine therapy than non-diabetic patients. Levamlodipine is an effective switch-over option for the elderly patients who experience oedema and other adverse events with racemic amlodipine.  Safety and tolerability  The use of racemic amlodipine is commonly associated with adverse events like peripheral edema and other side effects like headache, dizziness, flushing and abdominal pain. Controlled clinical trials showed that levamlodipine is rarely associated with these side effects. No controlled clinical study of levamlodipine has been performed in patients with hepatic impairment and renal impairment. Clinical studies in patients with normal liver function have shown that there is no elevation in the hepatic enzymes with the use of levamlodipine. However, caution should be taken while administering levamlodipine to such patients. In a postmarketing surveillance study, levamlodipine (2.5/5 mg) was found to be well tolerated (n = 1859) in patients with hypertension. Out of 314 patients, who reported peripheral edema with conventional amlodipine were switched over to levamlodipine and edema was resolved in 310 patients (98.72%) at the end of 4 weeks. Only in 4 patients was edema sustained. Only 30 patients (out of 1859) reported side effects. These side effects included vertigo, tachycardia, cough, headache, fever, mild difficulty in breathing and edema. Adverse events were mild in nature and no serious adverse events were reported.

It was released on November 28, 2012 on the digital distribution platforms GOG.com and Steam, as part of their Steam Greenlight program. In the game, players assume the role of Robert Hughes, a plague-stricken scientist, as he explores a seemingly uninhabited island, seeking out medicinal plants in an attempt to find a cure. Gameplay Miasmata is a first-person survival adventure game in which the player attempts to navigate an ailing protagonist across treacherous terrain and past an enigmatic threat in pursuit of medicinal plants or fungi that may cure him. The disease causes rapid dehydration if water is not regularly consumed, and while he does carry a small canteen, this is not enough for long trips inland or when stuck in the wilderness at night. Other threats include falling down steep cliffs and being stalked by the island's territorial creature. A small fall or coming close to drowning cause significant disorientation. He can ameliorate the disease's effects by creating medication at research stations. Simple anti-fever tablets lowers the fever, but more complex concoctions can be constructed which permanently enhance his strength and agility which are helpful while exploring the dangerous island. Medicines can be produced by finding plants, taking them back to a research camp, and processing them into tablets and tonics. The game features an intricate cartography system based on triangulation techniques. Areas can only be mapped after using triangulation to determine exactly where the character is relative to other landmarks. While looking at the map, he can fill in everything within line of sight by noting the relative locations of at least two other man-made objects. Although it is possible to navigate the island from memory, spending time fleshing out the map will prevent the character from becoming completely lost. Development The indie game was developed over four years by two brothers Joe and Bob Johnson under the studio name IonFX. Joe Johnson developed an engine for the game called MILO. Reception The game garnered a 76% on the review aggregation website Metacritic. Rock, Paper, Shotgun concluded its review by saying that \\"while it may be overtly low-budget in some ways it damn well succeeds anyway. This is a plague you‚Äôll want to catch\\". IGN wrote that \\"Surviving in Miasmata is not about the ending or the story it tries to tell, but the journey. The journey will be tough. The journey will be a trial of patience and will.

Experts from Latin America and Asia have also played a significant role in this effort. The project was initiated in 2011. Rationale The major focus of the INCRA is overhauling existing metrics used to calculate credit ratings. According to the project‚Äôs supporters, current evaluations focus solely on macroeconomic indicators while ignoring important political and socioeconomic factors. In addition to considering macroeconomic factors, the INCRA would take into account a country‚Äôs commitment to the rule of law, transparency, social cohesion, future resources, strategic capacity, implementation ability, and adaptability when calculating ratings. While acknowledging that no evaluation system can perfectly predict and prevent crises, the Bertelsmann Foundation was arguing that incorporating these forward looking indications would reduce global vulnerability to future financial crises. Critics of traditional credit rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's, or Fitch, claim they lack transparency and confer arbitrary and biased ratings based on a for-profit model. INCRA is the Bertelsmann Foundation's effort to address these existing problems by proposing a credit rating agency that functions as a non-profit NGO. Rather than creating a new credit agency itself, the Bertelsmann Foundation proposes that the G20, which already has ratings-agency regulation on its agenda, consider implementing this proposal. Beyond addressing the potential legal structure for an international credit ratings agency, INCRA integrates new methodologies and indicators to traditional macroeconomic data in order to achieve a more comprehensive sovereign ratings system. These indicators include a country's political, economic and financial development. Additional criteria may include a country's political management or the extent to which a country suffers from \\"brain drain.\\" INCRA has issued ratings for Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Brazil, which are summarized in the Country Ratings Report. The proposed agency would focus solely on sovereign ratings. INCRA would operate with funds from a multi-donor endowment which should be derived from a range of contributions from governments, corporate players, NGOs, foundations and/or private donors in order to minimize conflicts of interest in ratings decisions. To ensure INCRA's long-term efficacy and sustainability, the report estimates that an endowment totaling $400 million will be necessary. The original report outlines in detail the functionality of an international credit ratings agency. The Bertelsmann Foundation has measured political, economic and social management and development through its Transformation Index and Sustainable Governance Indicators projects for more than a decade. These projects involve a global network of more than 300 experts from over 150 countries.

The book was released on 28 February 2011 through Schirmer Books and focuses on the life of Ellis's dog Kubrick. Kubrick the Dog features several photos of Kubrick, a Hungarian Vizsla that Ellis adopted as a puppy in 1998, in several poses and with different people such as Stella McCartney. Ellis began working on the book in 2010 after Kubrick's death by canine lymphoma as a way of working through his grief over the dog's death. Reception Critical reception for the book was mostly positive. Basler Zeitung gave an overall positive review, stating that although some of the photographs felt a little deliberate, the book was also stirring.

In standard EESI, syringe pumps provide the liquids for both an electrospray and a sample spray. In neutral desorption EESI (ND-EESI), the liquid for the sample aerosol is provided by a flow of nitrogen.  Principle of operation  A ND-EESI experiment is simple in concept and implementation. A room temperature (20 ¬∞C) nitrogen gas stream is flowed through a narrow opening (i.d.~0.1 mm) to form a sharp jet targeted at a surface. The nitrogen molecules desorb analytes from the surface. The jet is only 2‚Äì3 mm above the surface, and the gas flow is about 200 mL/min with gas speeds around 300 m/s. The sample area is about 10 mm2.Wu, Z., et al., Sampling analytes from cheese products for fast detection using neutral desorption extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 2010. 397(4): p. 1549-1556. An optional enclosure, most commonly made of glass, can cover the sampling area to ensure proper positioning of the gas jet and the sample transfer line. A tube carries the neutral aerosol to the ESI spray. The sample spray in EESI produces a liquid aerosol with the analyte in sample droplets.Law, W.S., et al., On the Mechanism of Extractive Electrospray Ionization. Analytical Chemistry, 2010. 82(11): p. 4494-4500. The ESI spray produces droplets with protons. The sample droplets and the proton-rich droplets bump into each other. Each droplet has properties: analyte solubility in the ESI spray solvent and surface tension of the spray solution and of the sample solution. With dissimilar properties, some collisions produce no extraction because the droplets ‚Äúbounce\\", but with similar properties, some collisions produce coalescence and liquid-liquid extraction. The extent of the extraction depends on the similarity of the properties. Applications Ambient ionization techniques are attractive for many samples for their high tolerance to complex mixtures and for fast testing.

The YDSS was first constructed by the Province of Ontario in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The idea for this centralized sewage treatment system dates back to 1965 when the province decided that no additional sewage treatment facilities would be built on the Don and Rouge Rivers and Duffins Creek. The YDSS converges at the Duffin Creek WPCP and discharges clear, treated wastewater to Lake Ontario. The Duffin Creek WPCP has undergone significant expansion and performance upgrades over the past several years to meet growth needs in both Regions. In 2006, to meet the identified future needs and the requirements to accommodate approved growth, York and Durham Regions completed a Schedule C Municipal Class EA following Ontario Environmental Assessment Act requirements to expand plant capacity to 630 million litres per day (ML/d). Projections indicated that an expansion was required to accommodate expected growth in York Region to 2035. Referred to as the Stage 3 Expansion, this project increases wastewater treatment capacity at the WPCP from its previous capacity of 420 ML/d to 630 ML/d (annual daily average flow) At approximately 9:30 AM local time on 21 January 2014, an explosion occurred and thick black smoke could be seen rising from the building.

Taxonomy and species list These species were formerly included with the hooded mountain tanager in the genus Buthraupis. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that Buthraupis was polyphyletic. To create monophyletic genera, the black-chested mountain tanager and the golden-backed mountain tanager were moved to the resurrected genus Cnemathraupis that had been erected by Thomas Penard in 1919 with the black- chested mountain tanager as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek knƒìmƒì meaning \\"leg\\" or \\"shin\\" and thraupis, an unknown small bird.

In most of Bene's works is hard to recognize a sole genre: he himself defines his own art as \\"degenerate\\". It was published in 1976 in bundle with S.A.D.E. and Ritratto di signora del cavalier Masoch per intercessione della beata Maria Goretti. Written for Joseph of Cupertino, Bene's initial idea was to make a movie based on this screenplay, without success, as the production costs would have been prohibitive since theaters would have needed to equip a second screen in order to show Joseph's flights.  Joseph of Cupertino  A boccaperta is about Joseph's half-imaginary, half-legendary life from his birth to his adultness. Since birth, Joseph could levitate. His mother always mistreated and insulted him because of his \\"butter hands\\": whatever fragile object he held in his hands, he would drop. While young he went to live in a convent and was put in charge of looking after pigs. Other friars would make fun of him because of his goofiness and his butter hands, often pranking him by making him lift various objects. \\"Friar Donkey\\", as Joseph used to be known as, used to levitate in his room while staring at a painting depicting Virgin Mary. One day his mother came to see him but Joseph disowned her; ponting at the painting he recognized Mary as his real mother. He sometimes found himself levitating while staring at the sky, but every time he did this his superior yelled \\"Obedience!\\" to him and he would stop flying, often finding himself on a ledge, crying for help; at this point other friars helped him get down. Sometimes, during his flights, sick and deformed people would hold to his vest, hoping in a miraculous healing. Actually, after having reached a certain height some of them would fall to the ground, dying. One day his Virgin Mary painting was taken from him, in order to prevent him from flying again while looking at it. Saddened but obedient, Joseph accepts this decision.

He fought in several naval engagements during the Napoleonic Wars between 1800 and 1814. Later he was Commodore of the naval squadron based on the Cape of Good Hope. Early years Hood Hanway Christian was born at Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England on 23 July 1784, son of Admiral Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian and Anne Leigh. He was commissioned as a Royal Naval officer around 1792, at the age of eight. He commanded a division of boats at the Siege of Genoa on 25 January 1800, and for this was promoted to Lieutenant. First commands In October 1804 he was made an Acting Captain for his service in the Bay of Bengal. He commanded the Arrogant from January to March 1805. On 21 March 1805 he was promoted to Commander. He commanded the Sir Edward Hughes from April 1805 to January 1806. On 30 January 1806 he was made Captain at the age of twenty two. On 29 February 1808 Christian married Harriet Shute, daughter of Samuel Shute, in Bath Abbey. They had three daughters and four sons. Their oldest son, Thomas Hompesch Christian (1810 - 1858), also joined the navy and reached the rank of commander. Christian commanded HMS Heroine (formerly ) from March to November 1809. In this 32-gun frigate he participated in the reduction of Flushing in 1809 during the Walcheren Campaign. The Heroine was part of a squadron of ten frigates under the command of Captain Lord William Stuart. On 11 August 1809 this squadron sailed up the Western Scheldt under a light wind, suffering minor damage from the shore batteries of Flushing and Cadzand. Two men were wounded on the Heroine. On 13 August seven 74-gun line-of-battle ships under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan entered the river and began an intense bombardment of Flushing that lasted until the town surrendered on 15 August. Christian was Captain of the Iris from May 1811 to 1813. This 38-gun ship was part of the squadron that assisted Spanish patriots on the north coast of Spain in 1811 and 1812. In 1813 he captured three American ships sailing under letters of marque: the 12-gun Union and the 6-gun Cashier and Price. The American schooner Price was captured on 15 April 1813, and the prize money was shared by agreement with the captain and crew of . With the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, Christian disappears from the records for the next decade. Commodore and Admiral In 1824 John Filmore, acting Captain of and captain of the African Station, resigned due to debilitating fever and returned to England. On 16 September 1824 Christian was appointed Captain of the 42-gun Owen Glendower, and sailed in that frigate to South Africa where he took up his post as commander-in-chief of the Cape of Good Hope Station. A collection of his papers held at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich is mostly concerned with his activities on that station. It includes correspondence with his captains, Charles Richard Dyke Ackland on HMS Helicon and Sir David Dunn on HMS Samarang, with the Governor of Mauritius, General Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole, and with the Lieutenant-Governor of Eastern Cape of Good Hope, Sir Richard Bourke. In 1826 Christian impounded the Portuguese merchant ship Gratidao, leading to a court case and much correspondence. While he was Commodore the British were attempting to establish a settlement at Mombasa, and were negotiating a treaty with King Radama I of Madagascar to suppress the slave trade. His correspondence also covers these activities. On 28 June 1838 Christian was appointed Rear-Admiral of the White. He died on 31 August 1849 at Ryde on the Isle of Wight.

The zygosphene sits between the prezygapophysis in the neural arch, whereas the zygantrum sits between the postzygapophysis. This joint is found in snakes, lacertids, teiids, Gymnophthalmids as well as in some iguanids and cordylids.

With a total output of and an acceleration time from in 2.5 seconds. The Rimac Concept One was claimed to be the world's fastest accelerating electric vehicle in 2013. To advertise both Rimac Automobili and Formula E, the Concept One was used as the official zero-emission race director's car during the first season of Formula E championship in 2014. History 2011 Frankfurt Motor Showalt= Rimac Automobili, an automobile manufacturing company established in 2009 in Sveta Nedelja, Croatia, grew out of its founder Mate Rimac's garage hobby. The company's primary objective was to build the world's first electric sports car, starting, as Rimac put it, \\"with a blank sheet of paper\\". Since electric systems for high-performance electric cars were not available on the market, the company developed the necessary parts in-house and patented 24 innovations. When Mate Rimac's 1984 BMW 3 series blew its internal combustion engine while participating in a race, the opportunity was taken to convert it into an electric car. Working on his own, Rimac managed to fit a electric powertrain in his 3 series, which would soon become the company's first test mule. The car, now called the \\"Green Monster\\", set five F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)-sanctioned acceleration records in April 2011. This attracted the attention of the media and potential investors. Rimac also converted several other BMW 3 series (E30) cars into electric cars after some customers expressed interest in having such a car seeing the success of Rimac's car, and after some success, he moved to the more ambitious project of developing a car of his own. As a result, the electric sports car named the Concept One was born. The Concept One was introduced at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, and afterwards shown at the 2012 Paris Concours d'Elegance, where it received a positive response by the general public and potential customers. The car was set to cost US$ 980,000 once the serial production started in 2013. A limited production of 88 units was to be offered.https://www.topspeed.com/cars/rimac- automobile/2011-rimac-concept-one-ar114155.html The first car was delivered to an anonymous Spanish customer in January 2013. Rimac participated at the 2015 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb with a highly customised version called the E-Runner Concept_One. The vehicle took second place overall competing against ICE vehicles. The driver was the multiple Pikes Peak winner Nobuhiro Tajima. After a series of incremental improvements, the final version of the car was presented at the March 2016 Geneva Motor Show. In 2017, the Concept One participated at the Goodwood Festival of Speed for the first time, breaking the EV speed record on a timed track. Specifications With a total output of and of torque, the Concept One accelerates from 0‚Äì in 2.5 seconds and has an electronically limited top speed of . Each wheel is powered by a separate liquid-cooled permanent magnet synchronous electric motor and controlled by the so-called \\"All Wheel Torque Vectoring System\\" that distributes the power to the wheels in accordance with user setup and driving conditions. The car featured carbon ceramic brakes for improved stopping power. Also, the car has the ability to switch the power from front-wheel to rear-wheel drive or to equally distribute the power between all wheels. The motors are powered by a 90 kWh Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (LiNiMnCoO‚ÇÇ chemistry) battery, giving the car a range of per charge. The car's body is made of carbon fibre. The interior features custom leather upholstery and hand-made dashboard components. In the subsequent version presented at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, some performance figures were further optimised: the acceleration from 0‚Äì was achieved in 2.6 seconds, from 0‚Äì in 6.2 seconds, and from 0‚Äì in 14.2 seconds. The best time recorded was 9.9 seconds. The electronically limited top speed was increased to . In 2017, the 0‚Äì acceleration time was improved to 2.4 seconds. 0‚Äì took 2.5 seconds, 0‚Äì took 6 seconds, and took 14 seconds. The range was increased from . Sales In 2017, Rimac Automobili established official dealerships with PACE Germany, Manhattan Motorcars and Al Marooni Group for the regions of Europe, North America and the Middle East. Concept S alt= The Concept S is a lighter, more powerful, more aerodynamic and track-oriented iteration of the Concept One. The electric motors in the Concept S can generate , enabling the car to accelerate from in 2.5 seconds and attain a top speed of . By making modifications to produce the carbon fibre shell of the car, Rimac has reduced the weight of the Concept S by . The car also receives a full aerodynamic package which includes a large carbon fibre front splitter, side skirts, racing slicks and a large rear wing that generates 34% more downforce than the Concept One. On the interior, the car features racing bucket seats with 4-point racing harness, a new steering wheel, a driver focused infotainment system that projects only the most important information on the central display and Alcantara trim. Production was limited to two cars.  Derived vehicles  At the end of 2014 the Volar-e was put on the market. The company Applus+ IDIADA built this vehicle based on the Rimac Concept One, however, the battery size was reduced in order to save weight (38 kWh). The car had a range of . The battery could be recharged in 15 minutes. Reception Dan Prosser, in a 2016 review for the British magazine EVO, praised the vehicle's performance, styling, and torque vectoring system, but criticized its small cabin size and the brake pedal feel, giving it 3¬Ω out of 5 stars. He nonetheless stated \\"The Concept One does lack the soundtrack and the dramatic power delivery of a conventional supercar, but in the way it accelerates and in the way its torque vectoring system picks apart a corner it is enormously entertaining to drive quickly\\" and concluded that the car \\"proves EVs can be spectacular to drive\\". Richard Meaden wrote in EVO \\"Of all the emerging players, Croatian-based Rimac Automobili is by far the most interesting, the most authentic and, to my mind, the most evo. A leader in battery and electric-motor technology, its Concept One hypercar impressively showcases the fruits of its labours, with a huge amount of the car done in-house. ... If Rimac's own Concept One becomes a production reality it could well be a game- changer ‚Äì the Tesla of the hypercar world.\\" In 2017, Road & Track tested the car on city streets and described it as an \\"electric techno extravaganza\\" and claimed that \\"the carbon tub you sit in is rigid as a nuclear bunker\\". It described the feeling of taking off in traffic as \\"utterly impressive\\" and noticed its quietness by stating that \\"Rimac's hypercar only makes a sound when its inverters kick in, as a gentle reminder that you're sitting in the automotive equivalent of a small power station. A sexy, clean, fast and driftable power station.\\" The crew of Amazon Prime show The Grand Tour talked about the car in 2017 shortly after Richard Hammond's crash. Jeremy Clarkson, in a column for The Times, called it \\"amazing\\" and \\"brilliant\\", and stated that during his brief time behind the wheel he \\"couldn't believe how fast it accelerated\\", adding \\"we're not talking here about something that's as fast as Lamborghini Aventador. It is massively faster than that; it is faster than anything else I've ever driven by a huge, huge margin.\\" Richard Hammond, when asked for his take on the car during an interview session for DriveTribe, said he \\"loved it; it was astonishing\\", maintaining it had \\"proper ambition in terms of range\\" and describing its all-wheel torque vectoring system as \\"breathtaking\\". He further commented that it \\"felt genuinely futuristic and modern\\" and that \\"we are going to have to invent a whole new vocabulary ... for the sounds these things make\\". James May described it as an \\"exquisite pearl white electrical delicacy\\". Alex Roy tested the car in an episode for the NBC Sports programme /Drive that aired on October 26, 2017 and gave positive impressions. He stated \\"I haven‚Äôt driven anything this fast in my life.

Its type strain is NCYC 2889T. It is used in production of alcoholic beverages, including lager beers and pinot noir wine. It is isolated widely from the bark of Oak trees (Quercus family). Etymology \\"Saccharomyces\\" derives from Latinized Greek and means \\"sugar-mold\\" or \\"sugar- fungus\\", saccharo (œÉŒ¨Œ∫œáŒ±œÅŒπœÇ) being the combining form \\"sugar\\" and myces (ŒºœçŒ∫Œ∑œÇ, genitive ŒºœçŒ∫Œ∑œÑŒøœÇ) being \\"fungus\\". ‚ÄúKudriavzevii‚Äù was named in honor of VI Kudriavzev, a Russian scientist who worked with yeast taxonomy and ecology, and also played a large role in introducing the wild strain of S. paradoxus into science (Naumov et al., 2000). Other names include: ¬∑ S. kudriavzevii is the common scientific name ¬∑ Lager yeast ¬∑ Pinot Noir yeast History Saccharomyces kudriavzevii was initially isolated from decayed leaf (Kaneko & Banno, 1991) but is often isolated from bark of oak trees (Sampaio & Gon√ßalves, 2008). Description This species of yeast is within the Saccharomyces clade and can be isolated from a variety of substrates and is unique in that it cannot live on galactose and is cryotolerant. Shown in Figure 2 is a summary of activity when grown on a variety of substrates. S. kudriavzevii, compared to S. cerevisiae. Biology Ecology Yeast cells can be isolated from a variety of natural substrates ‚Äì virtually anything that contains sugars ‚Äì such as decaying fruit, bark, and soil. Optimal growth for many yeasts occurs at 30 ‚Äì 35 ¬∞C, but S. kudriavzevii is adapted to grow at much colder temperatures (Hittinger, 2013). Life Cycle & Mating There are two forms at which yeast cells exist in ‚Äì haploid and diploid ‚Äì each of which are a part of the reproductive cycle of the organism. These labels have to do with the number of copies of chromosomes the cell hold, diploids having 2n, haploids having 1n. Haploid cells are those that have the ability to mate to haploids of the opposite mating type to form diploids. They have also been found to be hardier when exposed to varying and extreme conditions, so diploid yeast can go through meiosis, a cellular reproduction process, when exposed to these conditions to produce four haploid spores. Hybridization Many species within the Saccharomyces sensu stricto clade have been found to hybridize with other species, S. kudriavzevii included. In particular, it hybridizes with S. cerevisiae (Belloch et al., 2009). This hybridization is unique in that it likely resulted from a single hybridization even involving creation of chimeric chromosomes holding some S. kudriavzevii genes and some S. cerevisiae genes (Belloch et al., 2009). In biological research The hybridization tendencies of S. kudriavzevii have potential for use in investigation regarding yeast evolution, which is commonly used as a model system for evolution in general (Botstein et al.,1997). In particular it may serve as a model for how proteins change through evolution. For example, glycerol, a chemical widely associated with cold-tolerant organisms, is one that may be produced in higher concentrations in S. kudriavzevii compared to S. cerevisiae (Belloch et al., 2009). Understanding protein evolution via this model system may help to predict and understand how protein evolution happens under relatively normal circumstances, allowing us to see on a broad scale what happens when cancer and genetic disorders change protein expression within humans. =Genome sequencing= S. cerevisiae was the first eukaryotic organism to have its genome entirely sequences, another member of the sensu stricto clade (Botstein et al., 1997). Since then, it was discovered that at least 30% of its genes have homologs within the human genome (Botstein et al., 1997). For this reason, yeasts are considered a model organism for a variety of experiments. Incorporation of S. kudriavzevii into this research has offered insights on how yeast evolve to survive in new environments and also how they hybridize to form new species (Belloch et al., 2009). Other uses S. kudriavzevii can be hybridized with S. cerevisiae and is commonly used in production of alcoholic beverages such as lager beer and pinot noir wine (Bing, Han, Liu, Wang, & Bai, 2014).

In animal studies, when this deletion was introduced to developing birds, their wing buds were noted to take on limb-like structures. The condition was first described by Dr. F. Liebenberg in 1973 while he followed multiple generations of a South African family,Liebenberg, F., 1973. A pedigree with unusual anomalies of the elbows, wrist, and hands in fine generations. S. Afr. Med. J. 47, 745‚Äì747. Accessed October 4, 2015. but it has since been noticed in other family lineages across the world. Symptoms People who are affected by Liebenberg Syndrome suffer from three main symptoms: # Dysplasia (improper formation) of the bony components of the elbow # Abnormal shape of carpal bones # Brachydactyly, a symptom where the fingers and toes are shorter than normal.  Phenotype  People with Liebenberg Syndrome have normal overall body structure. Their morphological differences are in both of their distal humeri, elbows, hands and wrists. The elbows are enlarged with abnormally large olecranons and radial heads. Patients have relatively fixed elbow positions and are therefore unable to pronate or supinate their forearms. Their wrists are also limited in their active movements and have very prominent ulnar sides of the joints. The fingers adopt toe-like structures. Brachydactyly and camptodactyly occur; fingers are short and abnormally bent. These changes in finger shape result in small club shaped appendages. Motion is reduced in all digital joints of the hand.  Genetics  Example of autosomal dominant inheritance Liebenberg Syndrome follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, whereby heterozygotes with this mutation express the disease phenotype. It is caused by a heterozygous mutation to chromosome 5. It involves the inappropriate enhancement of the PITX1 gene due to genetic deletions and chromosome translocations. PITX1 is a homeobox gene which are genes that regulate proper body structure development. This PT1X gene encodes a transcription factor expressed in hind limbs. When expressed, it causes the formation of hindlimb structures. Liebenberg Syndrome is a result of one of two different genetic mutations. The first is a deletion upstream of the PITX1 gene on chromosome 5. This deletion includes the H2AFY gene, which is responsible for suppressing an upstream enhancer element known as hs1473. When H2AFY is removed, the enhancer is brought closer to PITX1 and inappropriately enhances it in forelimbs, causing them to adopt hindlimb morphology. The second mutation that can cause the phenotype for Liebenberg syndrome is a translocation of chromosome 18 and chromosome 5. Translocation mutations are ones that switch parts of non-homologous chromosomes with each other. This move introduces two enhancers from chromosome 18 to move to a position directly upstream of PITX1 on chromosome 5. The enhancers increase transcription of the PITX1 gene and cause patients to develop the same phenotype described above. Diagnosis  Treatment  Surgery is an option to correct some of the morphological changes made by Liebenberg Syndrome. Cases exist where surgery is performed to correct radial deviations and flexion deformities in the wrist. A surgery called a carpectomy has been performed on a patient whereby a surgeon removes the proximal row of the carpal bones. This procedure removes some of the carpal bones to create a more regular wrist function than is observed in people with this condition.

Gong Cha's first Hong Kong store was established in 2009 by a Hong Kong native who had lived in Taiwan for five years. As of 2012, it had about forty-six stores in Hong Kong, mainly in MTR stations and shopping centers but that number has dropped to five due to decreased business from several health and safety scandals.

Ingestion of DEHP is known to cause heart problems and to affect male genital development. Even though Gong Cha's products were proved to contain no DEHP, the sales record of its branch in Causeway Bay dropped approximately 30%, caused by the news spread to Hong Kong. Gong Cha took a variety of actions to restore consumer confidence in the products, such as conducting tests on ingredients imported from Taiwan in order to prove their safety and in June 2011 discontinued certain kinds of juices in its Hong Kong branches before the test reports released. In the end, the products were proved to contain no DEHP.

He is regarded as the founder of the discipline of geology in Norway, and has also been credited for the discovery of the Jotunheimen mountain range. Personal life Keilhau was born in Gj√∏vik to parish priest Johan David Bertram Keilhau and Johanne Marie Bodom. In 1830 he married Christine Kemp. His wife had been engaged to mathematician Nils Henrik Abel, a friend of Keilhau. When Abel died of tuberculosis in 1829, Keilhau was worried about his fianc√©, and offered to marry her, although they had never met, and she accepted. Keilhau died in Christiania in 1858. Career Falketind was first climbed in 1820 by Keilhau, Christian Peder Bianco Boeck and Ole Urdi Keilhau is regarded as the founder of geology in Norway. He graduated from the Christiania Cathedral School in 1816. In 1821 he graduated in mining, the first one at the University in Christiania, and received further industrial practice in Kongsberg. He subsequently studied mineralogy in Berlin, and geology in Saxony. Keilhau made the first ascent of Falketind in 1820 along with two other climbers. He has later been labeled the \\"discoverer\\" of the mountain range of Jotunheimen. The mountain of Keilhaus topp is named after him. The 1820 journey, which he made along with fellow student Christian Boeck, was thoroughly documented in the article \\"Nogle efterretninger om et hidtil ubekendt stykke af det s√∂ndenfjeldske Norge\\". He lectured at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania from 1826. In 1827 he joined an expedition to Bj√∏rn√∏ya and Svalbard. At Svalbard, the mountain of Keilhaufjellet and the glacier of Mathiasbreen are named after him. He was appointed professor from 1834. Among his publications is the three-volume Gaea Norvegica (1838-1850).

The film was a pilot for an intended television series being considered by ABC. The movie presented the character as a James Bond-style superspy, and did not contain many elements from the comic book series. Ratings were described as \\"respectable but not exactly wondrous,\\" and ABC did not pick up the pilot. Instead, Warner Brothers and ABC developed a different Wonder Woman television concept that fit the more traditional presentation of the character as created by William Moulton Marston, turning away from the 1968‚Äì1972 era that had influenced the pilot. The New Original Wonder Woman, which premiered in 1975, starred Lynda Carter and eventually led to the Wonder Woman TV series. Crosby would later claim that she was offered the chance to reprise the role in that series. Background Cathy Lee Crosby in the first Wonder Woman film. Wonder Woman's first broadcast appearance in live-action television was a movie made in 1974 for ABC. Written by John D. F. Black, the TV movie resembles the Wonder Woman of the \\"I Ching\\" period. Wonder Woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) did not wear the comic-book uniform, demonstrated no apparent super-human powers, had a \\"secret identity\\" of Diana Prince that was not all that secret, and she was also depicted as blonde (differing from the black hair established in the comic books). This 1974 film follows Wonder Woman, assistant to government agent Steve Trevor (Kaz Garas) as she pursues a villain named Abner Smith (Ricardo Montalb√°n) who has stolen a set of code books containing classified information about U.S. government field agents. Along the way, she has to outwit Smith's chief assistants: the handsome yet dangerous George (Andrew Prine) and a rogue Amazon, Ahnjayla (Anitra Ford), whom Smith has taken on as a bodyguard; a brief duel between Wonder Woman and Ahnjayla is the film's only significant action sequence, which occurs during the final third of the story. The pilot aired originally on March 12, 1974 and was repeated on August 21 of that year. Ratings were described as \\"respectable but not exactly wondrous.\\" ABC did not pick up the pilot, although Crosby would later claim she was offered the series that was eventually given to Lynda Carter. An ABC spokesperson would later acknowledge that the decision to update the character was a mistake. Warner Brothers released this pilot into syndication as a stand-alone 90-minute telefilm, where it played on independent TV stations throughout the 1970s and 1980s. On December 11, 2012, Warner Brothers made the Cathy Lee Crosby pilot available as a Video On Demand purchase through their online store. Cast Home media Warner Home Video released the TV film to DVD in 2012 through Amazon.com and their Warner Archive collection.

Mod.31) was an artillery piece developed in 1931 for the Belgian Army which saw widespread service in the Battle of Belgium in 1940. It was colloquially known as the \\"'Quat'sept,\\" nicknamed after its caliber by the Belgian soldiers that used it. It was developed by the firm F.R.C., the Herstal-based Fonderie Royale de Canons, not to be confused with the French F.R.C. Versions There were two versions of the 47mm gun, each developed for a different situation: the Infantry version and the Light Troops version. The Infantry Version was furnished with heavier but more durable full-rubber tires. In contrast, the Light Troops version was equipped with pneumatic tires for greater road mobility. Both versions were capable of being incorporated into fixed defenses and bunkers for stationary purposes. One such example of this was in Belgium at the fortifications of the Albert Canal. They were also attached to Belgian combat vehicles of WWII as support weapons, such as the T-13 tank destroyer and the 'Canon antichar automoteur Vickers-Carden-Loyd Mk.VI'. Performance The 47mm anti-tank gun had an impressive performance compared to contemporary WW2 German or French designs ‚Äì respectively the 3.7 cm Pak 36 and 25mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun. In medium-range armor penetration, the Belgian model even outperformed the British Ordnance QF 2-pounder. For instance, armor-piercing rounds could penetrate of armored steel at a range of . This type of damage was largely attributed to the heavy caliber design with a shell weight of for the armor-piercing rounds. However, this performance came at a price. With a total weight of , not including ammunition or other equipment, the 47mm was a lot heavier than the German Pak 36 at . Despite its substantial mass, the 47mm was easier to conceal due to its relatively compact design. Repositioning of the Belgian anti-tank gun was aided by the Vickers Utility B armored tractors in the infantry divisions or the Ford Marmon Herrington armored tractors in the cavalry units.  Service history Second World War =Belgium= Over 750 47mm guns were in service in the Belgian army at the time of the German invasion in 1940. All active and first reserve infantry units, cavalry units, and units of the border guards were equipped with the gun, while the second reserve units had to make do with older anti-tank rifles. Every infantry regiment consisted of 3 battalions of rifle infantry and a single heavy arms battalion. This in turn consisted of three heavy weapon companies, one of which was equipped with 12 47mm guns. Given its good armor-penetrating capabilities, the 47mm could penetrate the armor of the German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks from a range of over . Reports of panzers knocked out by the 47mm during the Battle of Belgium do exist, but in general, the bulk of the Belgian army was deployed in the north of the country, on the flat terrain of Flanders, and not in the hilly terrain of the Ardennes in the south, which was regarded as impenetrable but nonetheless served as the primary route of invasion for about 2,500 German panzers. =Germany= Several hundred 47mm guns were captured by the Germans after the battle of Belgium. The German designation for these captured guns was the 4.7 cm Pak 185(b). A few were installed in Atlantic Wall defenses in Belgium and the Channel Islands. =Hungary= Several of the 47mm guns captured by Germany were donated to Hungary in 1940-1. This donation was to make up for Hungary's lack of anti-tank guns during Operation Barbarossa. However, their use by the Hungarians was limited due to a lack of spare parts. Furthermore, the armor-penetrating capabilities of the guns had also been surpassed by Soviet advances in tank construction. Most of the captured guns were relegated to training duties instead.

During the Third Reich he was a committed Nazi, with military, administrative, and research service in the SS, and his academic career was interrupted by imprisonment after the end of World War II. Life and career Ebel was born in Garsuche, East Prussia (now an outlying district of Jelcz-Laskowice, in Poland). His father's family were Russian migrants; his mother's family hailed from Switzerland. He did his Abitur in 1927 in R√∂√üel (now Reszel, also in Poland), and studied law, history, and philology at the University of K√∂nigsberg and Heidelberg University. Ebel completed his Habilitation at the University of Bonn in 1935 and after working as a docent at the Universities of Marburg, K√∂nigsberg and Rostock, received his first professorial appointment at Rostock in 1938. He spent most of his career at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he began work in April 1939 and in October of the same year succeeded Herbert Oskar Meyer as professor of German legal history, civil and mercantile law, agricultural and privatization law. Nazi Party Ebel joined the Nazi Party shortly after they came to power, on May 1, 1933, was a local party official while in Bonn, and following his Habilitation joined the Association of Nazi Docents, where he was local leader. Beginning in 1935, he was active in the Sicherheitsdienst, and in Rostock he worked for the Gau administration and represented the party on the law faculty. He worked as a scholar for both the Amt Rosenberg and, beginning in October 1938, the Ahnenerbe division of the SS. After the outbreak of war, he volunteered for the Waffen-SS and served with the Totenkopf division in the Battle of France, returning to G√∂ttingen in August 1940. The following year, he joined the Allgemeine SS, where he was promoted to Untersturmf√ºhrer. After another brief period of military service, he was assigned to the F√ºhrungshauptamt of the SS and then became division head for Indo-European and German legal history at the Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt. From November 1941 on, he was chief of race and settlement for the Waffen-SS, and in October 1942 he became Ahnenerbe division leader for \\"Legal history of Germans in the East\\". In 1943 he was promoted to Hauptsturmf√ºhrer, after which he again returned to G√∂ttingen. Post-war Ebel became a prisoner of war of the Allies in May 1945, lost his status as a civil servant under an act of the British occupation authorities on July 19 that year, and was then interned for more than two years until 1948. After that he worked for the Gothaer insurance company. In March 1949 he was able to have his classification reduced to that of Mitl√§ufer (fellow traveler), and in September 1950 to have his privileges as a civil servant restored, but he had meanwhile been succeeded in his professorship by Hans Thieme. In April 1952 he was given a teaching position at the university, and in March 1954, after Thieme had left to take up a chair at the University of Freiburg, he once more became a full professor. (He had unsuccessfully requested the faculty appoint him to a different chair that was open.) He took early retirement at 56 for health reasons in April 1965, but headed the university archives until 1978. Until his retirement from that position, he successfully prevented research into the Nazi period at the university. Research Ebel's primary specializations were constitutional history and the history of law, in particular early Germanic law. He was a member of the Konstanzer Arbeitskreis f√ºr mittelalterliche Geschichte, an association of medievalists, and beginning in 1959 of the Historische Kommission f√ºr Niedersachsen und Westfalen (Historical Commission for Lower Saxony and Westphalia). He edited and translated a number of early Germanic law codes including the Asega-b√¥k, the legal code for the Rustringian Frisians and one of the oldest surviving continental Germanic law codes. Despite his commitment to Nazism, his publications included a 1936 refutation of the notion that the employment contract derived from the relationship of Germanic followers with their lord. Honors Ebel was awarded the gold medal of honor of the city of L√ºbeck in 1967, of the city of Goslar in 1973, and of Kiel University also in 1973, and the Brothers Grimm Prize of the University of Marburg the same year.

It produced 447 kW (600 hp). Design and development During the second half of the 1920s Fiat introduced several water-cooled aircraft engines, including the A.20, A.23, A.24, A.25 and A.30. They were all upright V-12s with 60¬∞ between the cylinder banks; capacities ranged between 18.7 L and 54.5 L (1,141-3,326 cu in) and power outputs between 320 kW and 745 kW (430-1,000 hp). Producing 447 kW (600 hp) from 24.0 L (1,464 cu in), the A.30RA was towards the low power end of these ranges. The R, (Riduttori - reduced), indicated that the output was geared down. Many of the production A.30 R.A.s were fitted in Fiat's own fighters and fighter trainers, particularly in the Fiat C.R.32. Both this aircraft type and the Meridionali Ro.37 remained in service with the Regia Aeronautica when Italy joined in World War II in 1940; by then the engine was seriously dated.

The oldest known manuscript version, the First Riustring Manuscript (now in Oldenburg) is, besides the oldest extant text in Frisian, one of the oldest remaining continental codes of Germanic law. History and background A codex containing a copy of the code, the First Riustring Manuscript, survives in the archives at Oldenburg (24, 1, Ab. 1). While Joseph Bosworth believed it to have been written somewhere between 1212 and 1250 A.D., twentieth-century scholars date it ca. 1300, although some of the materials that it incorporates date to 1050. That version is the oldest surviving work written in Old Frisian, and one of the oldest surviving continental Germanic law codes (the Gulating law, possibly ca. 1150, may be older). The first modern scholarly edition was published in 1961 by Wybren Jan Buma in Dutch; a year later Buma, in cooperation with Germanic law scholar Wilhelm Ebel, published an edition and translation in German . The term asega by itself is translated as \\"lawman\\" or \\"speaker of law\\", and refers to the Germanic tradition of having an orator recite law (which did not have to be written) in assembly, a practice attested in the Scandinavian Gutalagen.  Contents  One part of the book is the Old Frisian version of the Fifteen Signs before Doomsday. Buma observed that the Asega-b√¥k's version has a style, compared to that of other versions, that is particularly Frisian. Although the list matches other versions, a conclusion was appended to it by its unknown author, who took multiple versions of the list as his or her source, in Buma's opinion, although relying mainly upon one. Rolf Bremmer noted that the attribution of the list to Jerome in the Asega-b√¥k's version was copied from Pseudo-Bede, and that the added conclusion is similar to Comestor's Historia scholastica. The deduction that it was taken from Comestor is what pushes the 20th century dating of the Asega-b√¥k later than Bosworth's dating, given that Comestor died in 1178. The book comprises, in order: * two similar, but not identical, versions of The Prologue to the Statutes and Land Laws (supporting the hypothesis, made by Buma, that the book is a compilation of prior texts from multiple sources); * the Seven Statutes and the Twenty-Four Land Laws; * the General Fine Register, part 1 (of 2); * the Riustring Fine Register; * the Wendar to the 17th Statute (Wendar meaning exception); * the Elder Riustring Statutes (that are modified from the originals to include references to Charlemagne and the Frisians); * the Younger Riustring Statutes; * two texts that begin Thet is ac friesk riucht (\\"This is also Frisian law\\"); * the Fifteen Signs before Doomsday, already mentioned; * the Riustring Fines Concerning Crimes Against Clergymen, part 1 (of 2); * a list of the situations in which one is allowed to break into a church; * the General Fine Register, part 2 (of 2); * a second group of texts that begin Thet is ac friesk riucht; * a list of coins and their values; * an outline of the ecclesiastical penalties for murder of relatives; * the Riustring Fines Concerning Crimes Against Clergymen, part 2 (of 2); * the Fines for Desecrating Church and Churchyard; and * the Riustring Synodal Laws. According to Johnston, this is one of a great many Frisian legal documents which have a secondary function: the promotion of the ideology of Frisian independence. He identifies three levels of ideology represented in those texts: \\"(1) the glorification of the concept of law in general, (2) the assertion of the idea of a Pan-Frisian law, (3) the propagation of the idea of Frisian independence and the promotion of Frisian unity against threats from outside\\". The only text in the codex he deems exempt from such ideology is the Fifteen Signs before Doomsday.

The film combines in-depth interviews, archival footage, and computer animation to recount the role that the group played in Israel's security from the Six-Day War to the present. The film was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards. Background Moreh has explained in interviews that he was inspired to make the film after watching Errol Morris‚Äôs Academy Award-winning documentary The Fog of War. Having just completed a film about former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, he came to realize the decisive role that the Shin Bet had played behind the scenes for the past forty years. \\"The idea to do this movie came to me while I was working on my previous film, Sharon. From my discussions with the prime minister‚Äôs innermost circle of advisors, I learned how the critique of some of these Gatekeepers influenced Sharon‚Äôs decision to disengage from Gaza.\\" The problem, according to Moreh, was getting the \\"Gatekeepers\\", or former heads of the Shin Bet, to agree to appear on camera and discuss their work and opinions. Given the secretive nature of the organization, none of them had ever done this before, and many of the topics he hoped to discuss with them were either classified or highly sensitive. Despite this initial difficulty, Moreh contacted one of the \\"Gatekeepers\\", Ami Ayalon, who had since been elected to the Knesset for the Labor Party and was serving as a Minister without Portfolio in the Security Cabinet. Much to his surprise, Ayalon not only agreed to participate, he also helped Moreh contact the other surviving former heads of the Shin Bet: Avraham Shalom, Yaakov Peri, Carmi Gillon, and Avi Dichter. The sixth participant in the film, Yuval Diskin, was still serving as head of the Shin Bet at the time. Though all the men agreed to participate, some were reluctant initially to discuss various incidents associated with their careers. Shalom, for instance, did not want to discuss his role in the hijacking of the 300 bus and summary execution of two of the terrorists, though the ensuing scandal ultimately led to his resignation. Over time, however, and with careful prodding, he agreed to discuss even that, and it now features as one of the film's seven segments. The Gatekeepers \\"gave me an unprecedented, intimate opportunity to enter the inner sanctum of the people who have steered Israel‚Äôs decision-making process for almost half a century,\\" Moreh has said. Moreh told The Economist that after interviewing the Shin Bet heads, he decided that Netanyahu \\"poses a great threat to the existence of the state of Israel.\\" He said that he seeks \\"to change the point of view of young Israelis. To tell them a story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has not been told before.\\" He told The Times of Israel that making the film \\"changed me a lot [...]. It made me more desperate, more bleak. I saw from their eyes how our leaders really don‚Äôt want to solve this problem. They do not have the audacity, the temerity, the will, the courage that we need from a leader.\\" He added, \\"I am not putting the blame only on the Israeli leaders. I think the Palestinian leaders suffer from the same horrible disease. I think that what [former Israeli foreign minister] Abba Eban said about how the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity applies to both sides.\\" Structure The film consists of seven segments: * No Strategy, Just Tactics ‚Äì covering the emerging role of the Shin Bet from the Six-Day War and the occupation of the Palestinian territories * Forget About Morality ‚Äì about the Bus 300 affair * One Man's Terrorist Is Another Man's Freedom Fighter ‚Äì about the peace process following the Oslo Accords * Our Own Flesh and Blood ‚Äì about Jewish terrorism, including the Jewish Underground and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin * Victory Is to See You Suffer ‚Äì about negotiations with the Palestinians during the Second Intifada * Collateral Damage ‚Äì about the assassination of Yahya Ayyash and other prominent Hamas militants * The Old Man at the End of the Corridor ‚Äì consisting of reflections on the activities of the Shin Bet and their ethical and strategic impact on the State of Israel Though the film follows a loose chronological order, each of these segments also delves into topics such as the controversy surrounding collateral damage, the efficacy of torture, and the morality of targeted assassination. The events described in the film are illustrated with archival footage and computer-generated imagery that brings historic photographs to life. An example of this is the computer-generated reenactment of the Bus 300 incident, based on photographs and eyewitness accounts. The film's computer animations were created by the French company Mac Guff. The filmmakers The director discussing the film at a directors' panel at the 240px The director of The Gatekeepers, Dror Moreh, is an experienced cinematographer who served as director of photography on several feature films, including Urban Feel and Desperado Square, and on a number of documentaries, among them One Shot, Asesino, and Underdog: A War Movie. His credits as a director include The Rose (a 6-part documentary series), To Be Mayumana (a documentary about an Israeli dance group), Under Cover (a 4-part docudrama about undercover police officers), Sharon (a documentary about Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's implementation of the Gaza Disengagement Plan), Occupational Hazard (a documentary about an Israeli journalist in Iraq), and Caesarea (an animated short about the history of Caesarea). The producer, , is the founder of Cinephil, a film sales, co-productions, and distribution company, and has taught Media at Israel's Open University and at the Management College in Tel Aviv. The interviewees The film consists of interviews with six former Shin Bet leaders. Avraham Shalom, who ran Shin Bet from 1980 to 1986, served on the team that brought Adolf Eichmann to justice and was forced to resign after ordering the summary execution of two terrorists. He was succeeded by Yaakov Peri, who was in charge of Shin Bet at the time of the Intifada. Carmi Gillon, head of Shin Bet from 1994 to 1996, warned that extremists would try to kill Prime Minister Rabin; the assassination of Rabin in 1995 shook the agency's reputation and led to Gillon's resignation. Ami Ayalon, his successor, sought to increase security around Israel's leaders. Avi Dichter, Shin Bet head from 2000 to 2005, was confronted with the Second Intifada. He was succeeded by Yuval Diskin, who served until 2011. Release Three years in production, the film was first released at the Jerusalem Film Festival in the presence of the Gatekeepers themselves. In North America, it was released on 31 August 2012 by Sony Picture Classics at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado in the presence of Errol Morris, and a week later (6 September 2012) at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was also screened at the New York Film Festival. Its first screening in Europe took place at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam. After a one-week release in December 2012 to make it eligible for the Academy Awards, a wider theatrical release in North America began on 1 February 2013. When the film was released, CNN reported that the former Shin Bet heads had made \\"stunning revelations\\" and that \\"all six argue ‚Äì to varying degrees ‚Äì that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is bad for the state of Israel.\\" CNN noted that Avraham Shalom \\"says Israel lost touch with how to coexist with the Palestinians as far back as the aftermath of the Six Day War of 1967\\" and that a \\"central theme of the documentary is the idea that Israel has incredible tactics, but lacks long-term strategy.\\" Moreh is turning \\"The Gatekeepers\\" into a five-part series for Israeli television and a book. Official Israeli response Barak Ravid wrote in Haaretz in March 2013 that there had been much \\"internal debate between Israeli diplomats\\" over \\"the question of whether the film reinforces the anti-Israeli narrative in the West, or alternatively paints a more complex and positive picture of Israeli society and the internal arguments that take place within it.\\" Mario Vargas Llosa praised the film as \\"evidence of the level-headedness and clarity of some elements in Israeli society.\\" Rafi Gamzu of Israel's Foreign Ministry called the film \\"proof of the highest order of Israeli democracy.\\" Israel's deputy consul general in Toronto, Hadas Wittenberg Silberstein, described it as \\"a powerful film that brings viewers into confrontation with the political- security dilemmas Israel faces\\" and that, while \\"not completely unequivocal\\", is \\"tendentious in its portrayal of Palestinian suffering.\\" Yigal Palmor, spokesman of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, complained \\"that the justification for the Shin Bet‚Äôs activity in the territories does not appear in the film.\\" While this is justifiable in a film addressed to Israeli audiences, who do not have to have the situation explained to them, international audiences \\"need more explanation of the background to understand how the three Shin Bet heads who appear in the film went into politics and how they are an inseparable part of a whole policy, some of which they criticize from within while agreeing completely with other aspects of it. None of them is a rebel who broke the rules and quit, or a subversive who tried to carry out a revolution. They see themselves as part of the establishment and as they see it, the purpose of their criticism is to improve it, not to smash it.\\" Yaakov Hadas-Handelsman, Israel's ambassador to Germany, has said that he \\"used the screening of the film here as an opportunity to emphasize the strength of Israeli democracy ... and the doubts that policymakers in Israel must face before they order the killing of terrorists ... There are not many democracies where one can view such a discussion at all, particularly considering Israel‚Äôs security situation.\\" Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador in Washington, D.C., came out strongly against the film, deploring the way in which Avraham Shalom \\"kind of\\" likens \\"Israel to Nazi Germany.\\" Oren said he had \\"been hearing about Jews leaving the screening asking why we should keep supporting Israel.\\" CNN reported in January 2013 that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had \\"no plans\\" to see the film. Reception On the aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% positive ratings from 111 critics, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Strikingly stark, brutally honest, and rivetingly assembled, The Gatekeepers offers essential perspective on a seemingly intractable war from some of the men who fought it.\\" The film holds a 91/100 on Metacritic based on 27 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" The New York Times critic A. O. Scott called the film the best documentary of 2012, deeming it \\"essential, eye-opening viewing if you think you understand the Middle East,\\" while Times critic Manohla Dargis named it one of the top ten movies of the year. Joe Morgenstern, film critic for the Wall Street Journal, also called The Gatekeepers one of the year's 10 best films. The film, noted Morgenstern, \\"brings together all the surviving directors of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency. What these tough and tough-minded men have to say about Israeli politicians, and the nation's current stance vis √† vis its enemies, is stunning and edifying in equal measure.\\" The Gatekeepers was also named one of the year's best films by David Edelstein of New York Magazine, Bob Mondello of NPR, David Denby of the New Yorker, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, Manohla Dargis of the New York Times, Peter Rainer of Christian Science Monitor, and Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter. The New York Times Jodi Rudoren of the New York Times described the film as offering \\"a disturbing narrative\\" whose message is that \\"The occupation is immoral and, perhaps more important, ineffective. Israel should withdraw from the West Bank as it did from the Gaza Strip in 2005. And the prospect of a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict diminishes daily, threatening the future of Israel as a Jewish democracy.\\" Haaretz Uri Klein, film critic of Haaretz, called The Gatekeepers \\"one of the most intelligent, mature and self-disciplined documentaries that have been made here recently.\\" But Aluf Benn, the editor of Haaretz, wrote in a column that the film is \\"convenient for the Shin Bet,\\" painting its chiefs as victims of the political leadership and going light on their own bending of the law.\\" The Jerusalem Post In an op-ed for The Jerusalem Post, Roz Rothstein and Roberta Seid of the advocacy group StandWithUs accused the film's director of \\"intellectual dishonesty\\" and of ignoring \\"history and context,\\" saying that while \\"the film tries to portray Israel‚Äôs antiterrorism policies as counterproductive and cruel, the interviews inadvertently tell a different story.\\" They wrote that the film fails to acknowledge that Israel \\"instituted Palestinian municipal self-government and administration, introduced freedom of speech and association, and vastly modernized the Palestinian economy as well as Palestinian health, welfare and education, turning the West Bank and Gaza into the world‚Äôs fourth fastest growing economy in the 1970s and 1980s.\\" In addition, charged Rothstein and Seid, the viewer of The Gatekeeper \\"never learns that Israel has repeatedly tried to do precisely what Moreh advocates\\" only to have its offers of land for peace rejected repeatedly. While Moreh wishes audiences to believe that Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank would bring peace, Israel's 2000 pullout from its Lebanese security zone and its 2005 removal of Gaza settlements led to increased \\"threats and terrorism from Iranian proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Iranian client Hamas in Gaza.\\" Moreh ignored the \\"hard realities\\" that \\"make the Shin Bet‚Äôs work so crucial and so heroic.\\" Troy criticized the Shin Bet heads, for \\"parlay[ing] their perspective as intelligence heads into preaching and politics,\\" and characterized Moreh's placement of Ayalon at the end of the movie as \\"film-making sleight-of-hand that makes his leftist views appear to be the sextet‚Äôs consensus position.\\" Troy also noted what he called the \\"outrage gap\\": while a Jerusalem audience had \\"reacted viscerally to descriptions of the beating deaths of two Palestinian terrorists,\\" it \\"seemed blas√© about photos of suicide-bombing carnage.\\" Troy argues, \\"Rabin‚Äôs assassin did not 'murder hope' ‚Äì Hamas and Islamic Jihad did.\\" Troy expressed pride that \\"these thoughtful, tough but human and sensitive heroes helped Israel navigate the agonizing questions the country faces in defending itself from toxic terrorists,\\" but added that \\"I know of no Palestinian movies agonizing about similar dilemmas.\\" Similarly, in an op-ed for The Jerusalem Post, history professor and Zionist activist Gil Troy wrote that \\"the film showcases Israel‚Äôs democratic vitality while seeking to undermine it.\\" Characterizing the interviewees as \\"blaming Israel and robbing Palestinians of their responsibility, culpability and dignity,\\" Troy viewed their outspokenness as a product of a \\"voyeuristic Facebook culture.\\" Troy argued that \\"spooks should not speak,\\" expressing doubt that \\"the past six CIA directors would dare so abuse their positions ‚Äì and the American public‚Äôs trust.\\" Honors and awards The Gatekeepers was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary in 2013 and for the Israeli Film Academy Award for Best Documentary. It won the Golden Trailer Award for Best Foreign Documentary Trailer, won Special Mention at the Biarritz International Festival of Audiovisual Programming in 2013, won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for Best Documentary/Non-Fiction Film.

It moved to Army Air Base, Portland in 1941, where it assumed responsibility for organizing two pursuit groups. It was inactivated later that year, and its personnel used as part of the cadre for headquarters units of Fourth Air Force. The wing was activated the following year at Drew Field, Florida. Although it was programmed for overseas deployment to the European theater and was assigned to Eighth Air Force, it was attached to Third Air Force for training.

She was christened on 1 April 1949. According to The Milwaukee Journal, \\"Deluge will be the most modern and one of the most powerful fire fighting craft west of New York city.\\"' Deluge had a low enough profile to proceed under the State Street Bascule Bridge and the Cherry Street Bascule Bridge, without requiring them to be raised. Deluge was Milwaukee's first diesel powered fireboat. According to an article published in Pacific Marine, shortly after her launch, diesel's advantages included: smaller crew; a crew requiring less specialized skills; and a lower profile, that enabled the Deluge to go under Milwaukee's low bridges to fight fires on her rivers. In 1978 The Milwaukee Journal reported that a recent refit had made her the only fireboat in North America equipped with an aqueous film forming foam delivery system. Deluge was retired in 1984. The last fire she fought was in 1975. She was to be replaced by an amphibious firefighting vehicle, sparing the cost of the eight crew trained to operate Deluge. In 1986 the chief of Milwaukee's fire department and the head of the firefighter's union disagreed on whether Deluges replacement was safe. Joseph Ruditys, President of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association noted that the vessel was a used vessel, that dated back to service in the War in Vietnam, and that it had required 600 hours of repairs. Chief William Stamm said the repairs were normal, and that the new vessel was safer than Deluge.

It borders the Southside area at its southern end, and has several bridge connections to nearby beaches, the Northside and Downtown. The expansive neighborhood was incorporated into the city in 1968 as a result the Jacksonville Consolidation, a city-county consolidation of the governments of the City of Jacksonville and Duval County. Arlington is known for its mid-century modern architecture, and contains several architectural significant homes designed by local architects Robert C. Broward, Taylor Hardwick, and William Morgan. History Fort Caroline depicted in an old etching Arlington was one of the first areas in the United States visited by Europeans; it was the site of the French Fort Caroline in 1564-1565, now represented by the Fort Caroline National Memorial. After the destruction of Fort Caroline, the area was only sparsely inhabited until the 19th century, when sawmills and plantations were established along the St. Johns River. After the American Civil War these gave way to residential developments, which were gradually absorbed into the Arlington community as it grew. Completed in 1910, Atlantic Boulevard was Florida's first modern \\"improved\\" highway and is considered to have been the beginning of the state's highway system. The highway connects the mainland portion of the city of Jacksonville with the Jacksonville Beaches. Its eastern terminus is in the San Marco neighborhood; running through Arlington and on to the Atlantic Ocean at the Jacksonville Beaches.Frommer's USA. 2009.

In 1947 the administration of Jacksonville University purchased land in the Arlington neighborhood on which to establish a main campus. The first building was completed in 1950 and classes officially began. The same year the school received full accreditation as a two-year college from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Originally known as William J. Porter University, Jacksonville University was founded in 1934 by William J. Porter. It began as a small private two-year college.\\"Timeline\\" . www.ju.edu. Retrieved October 20, 2010. Sixty students were enrolled in Porter University's first year of operation.\\"75th Anniversary\\" . www.ju.edu. Retrieved October 20, 2010. The school changed its name to Jacksonville Junior College in 1935. It relocated three times over the next fifteen years, but the influx of GI bill students following the end of World War II made a permanent location necessary. The school received full accreditation in 1962 as a four-year school from SACS. Following the 1953 opening of the Mathews Bridge the Arlington area experienced a significant increase in development, maintaining a faster growth rate than any other area in Jacksonville for two decades. The Mathews Bridge is a cantilever bridge which spans the St. Johns River, brings traffic along the Arlington Expressway between Downtown Jacksonville and Arlington. Midway between downtown and the beaches, the Sandalwood neighborhood began developing in spring of 1960 and is just one example of the many planned subdivisions beginning to sprawl across the area at that time.Conner, Deirdre:\\"Saving Arlington: What residents are doing to save it\\" Florida Times-Union, February 14, 2010 Opening in 1967, Regency Square Mall is an enclosed shopping mall developed by Regency Centers. Constructed at an expanse of sand dunes at an expense of $12 million, it initially featured three anchor stores: national chain JCPenney, along with May-Cohens and Furchgotts. The mall also included a Woolworth dime store as a junior anchor, a cafeteria style Piccadilly restaurant, as well as the single-screen Regency Cinema. Annie Tiques bar and restaurant opened on an outparcel of the mall. According to an Urban Land Institute study published by the Florida Times-Union in 1979, it was one of the most profitable retail centers in the nation, with yearly average sales of $156/ft¬≤ versus a national average of $88/ft¬≤. To give back to the community, the mall operators turned over thousands of dollars in coins from their decorative fountains to charities. All types of social events, from art shows to science fairs to horticultural exhibits were held there. Construction of the Dames Point Bridge began in 1985 and was completed in 1989. The bridge crosses the St. Johns River using a cable-stayed design, connecting Arlington to the Northside of Jacksonville. designed by HNTB Corporation and RS&H;, Inc, and constructed by The Massman Construction Company, the main span is , and is high. When built, it was longest concrete cable-stayed bridge in the world. Geography Together with Northside, Westside, and Southside, Arlington is considered one of the large sections of Jacksonville. Initially, Arlington was a small settlement across the St. Johns River east of the present day central business district. The area grew substantially in the latter part of the 20th century, and now includes many smaller neighborhoods and developments. Today it refers to most of Jacksonville east and south of the St. Johns, west of the Intracoastal Waterway, and north of the Arlington River and Southside.Wood, pp. 302‚Äì303. Using GIS to sort 87 businesses with \\"Arlington\\" in their name, McEwen came to a similar definition, though noted that Arlington overlaps with Southside at its southern end.McEwen, p. 64, 69.

Commercial districts The Regency area describes the commercial and retail development centered around Regency Square Mall. The commercial district encompasses an area equitable in size to Jacksonville's downtown, and consist of multiple corridors along the Southside Connector (SR 113). These include SR 115 (Southside Boulevard), SR 10 (Atlantic Boulevard), Regency Square Boulevard and Tredinick Parkway. In a 2010 Arlington vision plan, citizens recognized the Regency Square Mall property as being ripe for redevelopment, with the potential to attract new businesses and consumers. The comprehensive report covered environmental, economic, and quality of life issues in the Greater Arlington region. The groups approach to the mall property was to redevelop the land with transportation and density in mind. The approach would entail mix-used structures, a gridded street pattern, and infill development. Emphasis is put on the vastness of the area and its equitable size to downtown. Crowley Maritime Corporation, an international provider of marine solutions, energy and logistics services, is headquartered in the Regency business district. As of July 2016, the company was ranked the 13th largest private company in Florida, with revenue of $2.2 billion.

The song is based on both the Eis polla etƒì (\\"Many Years to You\\") and on the Byzantine Rite polychronion (from the m≈≠nogaja lƒõta) or the hierarchical acclamation Ton Despotin, which is normally sung at the end of church services. The song is also sung at informal gatherings (such as birthdays or name days) and at formal events, such as weddings, church events or other celebrations.Patronage of the Mother of God Many variations of the melody are in use, but the lyrics in most cases stay the same (i.e., repeating Mnohaya lita). It remains an integral part of Ukrainian diaspora culture long after assimilation. Similar songs The song serves the same function as \\"Happy Birthday To You\\" or \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\". As a secular song, its message is similar to that of the Polish \\"Sto lat\\" (\\"One Hundred Years\\") and is traditionally sung to a person to express wishes of good health and long life.

By 2014, she had worked with community organizers and celebrities to found 20 libraries. The organization she co-founded provides basic assistance to those in poverty and with disabilities and attempts to empower people through education and access to books and libraries. She is also involved in trying to stop child labor in Argentina, specifically in the yerba mate regions. Biography Patricia Liliana Ocampo was born 26 December 1979 in Ober√°, Misiones Province, Argentina. She grew up in a family that could not afford books and realized when she was in school the power books have to expand ideas. She serves as the regional head of the Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services (AFSCA), Argentina's broadcast media regulator. In 2011, she helped found the movement \\"Un sue√±o para Misiones\\" (A dream for Misiones Province), an organization that attempts to bridge the gap between government services and citizens needs. Primarily known for building libraries the group addresses a wide range of issues in Misiones Province, from illiteracy to providing clothing and basic needs for citizens living in poverty, to creation of community gardens to assistance to those with disability, to addressing child labor. Ocampo has been successful in building support for expanding and creating new libraries by both community involvement and asking celebrities and writers to donate books or help raise funds. In 2014, the 20th library was built. Libraries In 2010, Patricia Ocampo, Jorge Kordi and Daniela Paola Friedl began a project to build libraries throughout the Misiones Province. The goal was to build ten libraries the first year in villages with populations between 2500 and 5000 people, seeding each library with 1,000 initial books. The first library they completed was in the village of San Mart√≠n in the former home of Eino Parkkulainen, who created the Finnish- Spanish dictionary. The second library was founded in Puerto Leoni. Libraries three, in the barrio 180 Viviendas de Ober√°; four, in Guaran√≠; and five, in Colonia Victoria were all founded by the organization's first anniversary. The sixth library opened by the group was in Loreto and the seventh was in Panamb√≠. The eighth library was built in the village of Colonia Delicia and named after Guido Falaschi, whose racing circuit has supported Un sue√±o para Misiones. The 9th library opened in Wanda and the 10th library opened in Caraguatay in November, 2012. The 11th library was built in Puerto Libertad, the 12th in Santo Pip√≥, and in March 2013 the 13th library was opened by the group in El Alc√°zar. The 14th library was built in Paraje Parejha, the 15th in Puerto Iguaz√∫, and the 16th library was founded in El Saltito. The 17th library was built in Tobuna, and the 18th library was established in San Pedro de Jujuy. The 20th library opened in 2014 in the barrio Sarmiento of the town of Eldorado. Child labor She has met with the National Commission for the Eradication of Child Labour (CONAETI) to discuss working conditions of child laborers. On 4 April 2014, a draft resolution was adopted by the Argentine Chamber of Deputies acknowledging Ocampo's work in the Misiones province since 2010 and declaring their intent to eradicate exploitation of child laborers in the Yerba Mate industry. In October, 2014, Ocampo attended a public audience with Pope Francis in the Vatican City to discuss child labor. In March, 2015, she took the campaign against child labor to the legislature hoping to gain support for a national bill banning the practice in Argentina.

Definition A stochastic Petri net is a five-tuple SPN = (P, T, F, M0, Œõ) where: # P is a set of states, called places. # T is a set of transitions. # F where F ‚äÇ (P √ó T) ‚à™ (T √ó P) is a set of flow relations called \\"arcs\\" between places and transitions (and between transitions and places). # M0 is the initial marking. # Œõ = is the array of firing rates Œª associated with the transitions. The firing rate, a random variable, can also be a function Œª(M) of the current marking. Correspondence to Markov process The reachability graph of stochastic Petri nets can be mapped directly to a Markov process. It satisfies the Markov property, since its states depend only on the current marking. Each state in the reachability graph is mapped to a state in the Markov process, and the firing of a transition with firing rate Œª corresponds to a Markov state transition with probability Œª.

The construction of the Bismarck Tower located on the \\"Sinnberg\\", a hill in the German spa town of Bad Kissingen, started in 1914 following the plans designed by architect, Wilhelm Kreis. It was projected by the local Bismarck Tower Association under the chairmanship of its founder, pharmacist Oscar Ihl. This association was in favour of Bismarck and the German Empire and competed in a certain way with the Wittelsbacher Association, which, even after the Unification of Germany, regarded the Kingdom of Bavaria to be a sovereign kingdom and built the Wittelsbacher Tower in Bad Kissingen in 1907.Werner Eberth: Bismarck und Bad Kissingen. Theresienbrunnen-Verlag, Bad Kissingen 1998, p. 341 Up to that time, the architect of the Bismarck Tower, Wilhelm Kreis, had already designed different Bismarck Towers; his concept \\"G√∂tterd√§mmerung\\" was carried out in 47 towers alone, which differed only slightly from each other. The construction of the Bismarck Tower in Bad Kissingen, however, followed a completely new design. Due to the outbreak of World War I, a delay in finishing the construction took place. It was only on 2 December 1926 that, under the promotion of the \\"Movement for Completing the Tower\\" under the chairmanship of Wolfgang Singer, the director of the spa gardens, that the roofing ceremony could be held.Sieglinde Seele: Lexikon der Bismarck-Denkm√§ler. Michael Imhof, Petersberg 2005, pp. 227f. The completion of the tower's exterior was delayed until 1930 due to the Great Depression. In 1934, Wolfgang Singer conveyed the construction of a hairpin-bended footway leading to the Bismarck Tower. During World War II, the Bismarck Tower was used as an observation point for observing the airspace. It was only in 1985 that the construction of the tower's interior was started. So, the tower could be opened to the public on 21 June 1986. A staircase, bathrooms, and an observation deck were built into the tower.  Further reading  * Denis A.

Le Comte (1831) A koff is a historical type of sailing vessel that was used for coastal shipping off Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries. A typical koff had one and a half masts with a gaff rigged main sail and spanker and one or two square sails in the main top. The hull was plump with a flat bottom and a heavily rounded, raised bow and stern. Smaller koffs could be equipped with leeboards. Due to the shallow draught, koffs were especially suited for inshore shipping in shallow waters. The koff had been developed in the late 17th century in the Netherlands. Smaller than the fluyt, its rounded bow and stern provided however for more storage on board. This made it a popular type that saw increasing service. Koffs were often counted among the galiots by contemporary sources because the differences are very subtle: the galiot was considered more slender and therefore more elegant. On the koff, a deckhouse could be installed between the two masts which would provide shelter for up to twelve crew men. The typical dimensions have been reported as \\"80 feet long, 21 feet wide and 11 feet deep\\". Later versions could have a schooner or galeas rig.

Early life Born and raised in Aberdeen, Washington, Marbut was a three-sport letterman at Aberdeen High School in baseball, basketball, and football. He earned all-league honors three times each in baseball and football and once in basketball. After graduation in 1992, he attended Edmonds Community College, where he played baseball for coach Bill Stubbs. At Edmonds, Marbut was a two-time All-Conference infielder, and was named most valuable player of his team in 1995. After earning an associate's degree, he transferred to Portland State University, where he continued his baseball career as an outstanding hitter for the Vikings. Career Coaching Marbut began his coaching career back in Washington in 1998 as an assistant at Capital High School in Olympia, where he helped guide the Cougars to the state 3A championship. He then was an assistant at Bellevue Community College, which captured a conference championship in 1999. Following that season, Marbut returned to Edmonds Community College as head coach for four seasons and earned conference coach of the year honors twice and division coach of the year three times. His record at Edmonds was 152‚Äì38 (), including a league record 43 wins in 2003. Marbut came under fire when a Seattle Times article stated Marbut padded his academic resume while at Edmonds CC, and Washington State, where he coached when the article came out, came out strongly in his defense.https://pac-12.com/article/2006/03/23/wsu- responds-donnie-marbut-story Prior to the 2004 season, Marbut became an assistant at Washington State under fourth-year head coach Tim Mooney, where his work with infielders led to a then-school record .971671 fielding percentage and the first winning record for the Cougars since 1998. Following just one season as an assistant, Marbut became head coach at WSU after Mooney's forced resignation in late May 2004. At the time, he was the youngest head coach in the Pacific-10 Conference, at 30 years old. With Marbut as head coach, Washington State won more than 300 games, produced 23 major league draft picks, and dramatically improved a disastrous Academic Progress Rate score. Following WSU's consecutive post-season appearances in 2009 and 2010, when the Cougars finished second and third in the Pac-10 respectively, Marbut believed the time was right for Washington State to invest in baseball facilities to compete long-term with other programs in the Pacific-10 Conference and around the Pacific Northwest and he personally raised approximately $3 million in pledges to build a state-of-theart clubhouse; construction on the $10 million facility begins in 2019. Following the 2010 season, Washington State Athletic Director Bill Moos extended Marbut's contract, stating \\"During his tenure as WSU‚Äôs head coach the program has improved each year on the field and in the classroom. He has embraced the Cougars‚Äô storied history by reconnecting with former players and bringing them back into the program while his vision and passion for the future cannot be matched.

It was against the British occupation of the Ionian Islands and in favor of union with Greece. On 26 November 1850 the Radical MP John Detoratos Typaldos proposed in the parliament the resolution for the union of the Ionian Islands with Greece. The resolution was signed by Gerasimos Livadas, Nadalis Domeneginis, George Typaldos, Frangiskos Domeneginis, Ilias Zervos Iakovatos, Iosif Momferatos, Telemachus Paizis, Ioannis Typaldos, Aggelos Sigouros-Dessyllas, Christodoulos Tofanis. Britain responded with persecutions, arrests, imprisonments, exile and closure of newspapers. In 1862, the party was split into two factions, the United Radical Party and the Real Radical Party.

Detail from the Kuenring pedigree (B√§renhaut), Zwettl Abbey, 14th century Hadmar I of Kuenring (alt. spelling Hademar; died 27 May 1138) was a German nobleman who served as a ministerialis in the Margraviate of Austria (Ostarr√Æchi). Biography Hadmar first appeared in an 1125 deed, in the service of the Babenberg margrave Leopold III. He probably was the son of Nizzo, who served as a burgrave on the castles in Krems and Gars. While many sources refer to Hadmar as a (great-)grandson of legendary Azzo of Gobatsburg, more recent research has shown this to be incorrect. He is credited for the construction of K√ºhnring castle (in present-day Lower Austria), which became the ancestral seat of the Kuenring noble family. Hence, Hadmar was the first member of the dynasty to style himself \\"of Kuenring\\" from 1132 onwards. Hadmar also had D√ºrnstein Castle erected in his Wachau estates, where about sixty years later King Richard I of England was imprisoned after being captured near Vienna by Duke Leopold V of Austria. In 1137, Hadmar and his wife Gertrud of Wildon founded the Cistercian abbey of Zwettl, along the lines of the late Margrave Leopold III who had founded Heiligenkreuz Abbey four years earlier. Hadmar died without issue the next year; like his brothers, and is buried in G√∂ttweig Abbey. His relative Albero III of Kuenring succeeded to his lordship. The establishment of Zwettl Abbey was confirmed by King Conrad III of Germany and Pope Innocent II in 1139/40.

Founder and Tamblyn banner Gordon Tamblyn was born in Belwood, Ontario in 1878. He apprenticed to a druggist in Whitby, Ontario for a few months before enrolling in the Ontario College of Pharmacy. After graduating in 1901 he began work at the Burgess-Powell Pharmacy, on Yonge Street in Toronto. In 1904, with capital of $500, he opened his own pharmacy at Queen Street East and Lee Avenue, in Toronto‚Äôs Beaches neighbourhood. Tamblyn‚Äôs Cut Rate Drugs featured a soda fountain like many druggists of that period, and offered a delivery service. He opened a second store in 1907, and in 1910 took over another store from a retiring pharmacist. In 1911, Tamblyn incorporated his business, and began adding new locations almost every year, eventually expanding into other parts of Ontario. During the 1920s, Tamblyn‚Äôs chain expanded to about 60 stores, primarily in Toronto and area. Tamblyn died on August 17, 1933, during a round of golf at the age of 55. As subsidiary 1960 to present George Weston Limited purchased the chain in 1960, and continued to operate it alongside its Loblaws chain of grocery store, creating a \\"T\\" logo to match Loblaws' L logo. The chain declined under Weston's management and was sold to the United Kingdom‚Äôs Boots Group chain in 1978. Boots changed the stores over to the Boots name, and sold the chain in 1988 to Oshawa Group which converted them to the Pharma Plus banner in 1989. In 1997, Pharma Plus was purchased by Katz Group of Companies and re-badged as Rexall beginning in 2015. In 2016 Katz sold Rexall to McKesson Canada. While the Tamblyn name is long gone, some Rexall units have been continuously operated since the original Tamblyn ownership.

It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. The hall was built for the Woodhey branch of the Wilbraham family. The original date is probably 15th century, and the hall is often considered the oldest half-timbered building in the town not to have been encased in brick. The external appearance is early Elizabethan, with both ornamental panelling and close studding. It was recorded in 1577, and is known to have survived the fire of 1583, which destroyed the adjacent building. It has been substantially altered from its original form, in particular with the addition of a pentagonal bay in the late 16th or early 17th centuries. The timber frame was covered with render in the 18th century, and by the mid-20th century the hall had become very dilapidated. Restoration work was carried out by James Edleston in the 1960s. Joseph Priestley, scientist and philosopher, is believed to have lived at the hall in 1758‚Äì61, while he was minister at the nearby Unitarian chapel. Sir William Bowman, histologist, ophthalmologist and surgeon, was born there in 1816.

The hall is generally considered to be the oldest half-timbered building in the town that has not been encased in brick.Vaughan, p. 25Nicolle, pp. 24‚Äì25 Hospital Street was the main road between London and Chester; the medieval St Nicholas Hospital, which gave the street its name, remained in use until 1548.Garton (1983), p. 10Hall, pp. 48‚Äì53 Sweetbriar Hall would originally have stood at the eastern edge of the town.Garton (1983), p. 5 The north side of Hospital Street, where Sweetbriar Hall is located, was only sparsely occupied in the Tudor era; the south side of the street was marshy and little built on. Much of the area north of the hall between Hospital Street and Beam Street was owned by Combermere Abbey until its dissolution in 1538, being used as orchards, fields and gardens; it remained largely gardens and crofts when the first map of Nantwich was drawn in 1794.Lake (1983), p. 11Garton (1978), p. 83 Other early buildings at the eastern end of Hospital Street include number 116, a house of Georgian appearance on the south side, which incorporates a substantially older timber-framed house, parts of which have been dated to the late 15th century.Stevenson, p. 16Lake (1983), pp. 13, 41‚Äì44 Rebuilding of the hall is recorded in 1577, at the date when Churche's Mansion was built further east along Hospital Street. The hall is known to have survived the fire of 1583, which reached the adjacent building and destroyed much of the centre of the town.Garton (1983), p. 82Hall, p. 105 Richard Wilbraham's journal entry for the fire records: :...there was consumed by the same ffyeer ... all the hospell strete vpon both sydes past the myddest thereoff & dyd staye at the howse of Thoms. wryghte opon ye sowth syde of the strete: And at another howse of Mr. Wylbrahms. of Woodehey wherein Randull Maynewaring dwelled upon ye north syde.

In 1672, it was briefly licensed for use by the Presbyterian preacher Robert Fogg; the owner was then John King. It was still owned by King in 1691, and occupied jointly by him and his tenant, the Reverend Samuel Lawrence. Lawrence was the minister of the town's first Presbyterian Meeting House in 1688‚Äì1712, and was a close friend of the well- known Presbyterian minister, Matthew Henry.Hall, pp. 384‚Äì6 According to some sources, the scientist and philosopher Joseph Priestley lived at Sweetbriar Hall while he was in Nantwich in 1758‚Äì61.Lake (1981), p. 12 A red-brick former school at the rear of the hall dating from around 1701 has also been identified as Priestley's house. He was the minister of a Unitarian chapel, now demolished, which stood on the corner of Hospital Street and Pratchett's Row, and also established a school in an adjacent building on Hospital Street.Schofield, pp. 75‚Äì79Lamberton & Gray, p. 116 William Bowman In 1814, retired tobacconist and grocer Eddowes Bowman bought Sweetbriar Hall from the Leversage family. His son was John Eddowes Bowman, a geologist and naturalist, and Sweetbriar Hall was the birthplace of his son, histologist, ophthalmologist and surgeon Sir William Bowman in 1816.Hall, p. 509‚Äì11 Eddowes Bowman and John Eddowes Bowman were partners in a bank that failed in 1816, leaving the family destitute. They left Nantwich that year, and the hall was sold to Mary Bennion, passing via her sister Elizabeth to the Butterworth family, who were still living there in 1892.Kelly's Directory, 1892 The hall was covered in render during the 18th century.Simpson, plates 22, 23 An engraving published in James Hall's History of 1883 shows the rendered front fa√ßade with hexagonal, octagonal, rectangular and diamond-shaped window lights, two 18th-century doorcases, several tall brick chimneys and an altered roofline.Hall, p. 353 In photographs from around 1900 to the 1950s, the hall has a pebble-dashed appearance and retains the old windows, doorcases and chimneys; a front garden enclosed by low iron railings is also present.Davies, pp. 21‚Äì22Hurley, pp. 16‚Äì18 The railings had been removed by 1948, presumably during the Second World War.Bavington et al pp. 18‚Äì19. The hall was listed on 19 April 1948, and was one of the first group of buildings in Nantwich to attain this status. During the 1940s and 1950s the hall deteriorated, and by 1958 it was in a dilapidated condition. Local architect James Edleston restored the building in the 1960s. The majority of the render was removed, as well as most of the old windows, one of the Georgian doorcases and several chimneys. The front garden also disappeared at this time. Sweetbriar Hall is now divided into two houses. As of 2012, number 65 is used as offices for the Bower Edleston architects' practice; number 67 is residential. Description View showing the gabled bay of number 67 Sweetbriar Hall is located at numbers 65 and 67 on the north side of Hospital Street (). It stands at the junction with an old footpath, The Gullet, now a pedestrian passage giving access to Wesley Close. Number 67 is now a separate building known as \\"Wayside\\". The hall probably formerly included the adjacent numbers 69 and 71, also listed at grade II, completing the terrace. The hall is a timber-framed, black-and- white, two-storey building under a tiled roof. The original plan had a central hall with two cross wings, a typical rural mansion layout which is similar to that of Churche's Mansion.Lake (1983), p. 13 One cross wing (east) would have been the parlour, the other (west) the service wing, including a buttery and kitchen. The projecting pentagonal wing was added to the end of the central hall in the late 16th or early 17th century. The timber frame to the front fa√ßade and half of the west (left) side features decorative framing, made up of small panels containing ornamental devices. Patterns include chevron bracing with middle rails, often inverted, which forms herringbone patterns and diamonds. This type of decoration is typical of early Elizabethan work (mid-16th century) and is also seen at Little Moreton Hall (c.1504‚Äì1610).McKenna p. 13, Figure 28 Curved braces forming concave-sided diamonds are also present; this is a common motif in Cheshire, also seen at Churche's Mansion, Chorley Old Hall and Blackden Hall.Hartwell et al., p. 24Harris, p. 70McKenna, p. 35 The ornamental panelling is not carried to the rear of the west face, presumably for cost reasons. Close studding with a middle rail is used on the back half of the west face, as well as parts of the Hospital Street fa√ßade. This mix of decorative framing with close studding is unusual in Nantwich; other examples are Churche's Mansion and two houses built after the fire, 46 High Street and 3 Church Lane.Lake (1983), pp. 106‚Äì11 The rear of the building has small framing. Numbers 67‚Äì71, showing the 18th- century doorcase in no. 67 (left) In number 65, the west (leftmost) wing projects and is gabled; its Hospital Street fa√ßade has jetties to the first and second floors. The second bay has a central modern doorway. The pentagonal wing is a flat-roofed bay with a single jetty. The timber frame has been infilled with plaster and cement, and the windows in this part are all modern. Number 67 has a gabled bay on the left, with small jetties to the first and second floors. In the right-hand bay, the 18th-century doorcase remains and is topped with a pediment. Number 67 has two iron casement windows, which probably date from the 17th century, and have small rectangular lights. Much of the timber frame in this part remains concealed behind render. The original plan has been substantially altered over the centuries, and the interiors modernised. The internal beams of the former buttery are more crudely finished than those of the parlour, and this wing has a sandstone chimneystack. The staircases date from the late 17th or 18th century; that in number 67 has latticework in the Chinese Chippendale style. The roof truss is unusual in having a short king post from the collar beam.

He is considered to be one of the world's most prominent sociolinguists and linguistic anthropologists, and has contributed substantially to sociolinguistic globalization theory, focusing on historical as well as contemporary patterns of the spread of languages and forms of literacy, and on lasting and new forms of inequality emerging from globalization processes.  Biography  Born in Dendermonde, Belgium, Blommaert received his PhD in African History and Philology from Ghent University in 1989. After graduation Blommaert started as research director at the International Pragmatics Association hosted at the University of Antwerp. In 1999 back at the Ghent University he became Associate Professor and head of the Department of African Languages and Cultures. In 2005 he was appointed Professor and Chair at the Institute of Education, the University of London. In 2008 he moved to Finland, where he was appointed Finland Distinguished Professor at the Department of Languages of the University of Jyv√§skyl√§, which he held until 2010. In 2007 he was appointed Professor of Language, Culture and Globalization and Director of the Babylon Center at Tilburg University. He is also Professor at Ghent University. He holds honorary professorships at Beijing Language and Culture University, the University of the Western Cape and Hellenic American University.  Work  Blommaerts work focuses on analysing issues of power and social inequality in language and society under conditions of contemporary globalization, from a discourse analytical and ethnographic perspective. His main focus is the ethnographic study of inequality in society, and particularly how it relates to language usage. Apart from a voluminous academic body of work, Blommaert has written extensively in Dutch, empirically addressing broader social and political issues in Belgian and Dutch society: nationalism, populism and democracy, asylum politics, issues in language and education, and essays on the sociology of work under neoliberalism.see the following titles, published by EPO in Berchem: \\"Ik stel vast\\" (2001); \\"Het Belgische asielbeleid: Kritische perspectieven\\" (with Ronald Commers); \\"Populisme\\" (2004, with Eric Corijn, Dieter Lesage & Marc Holthof); \\"De crisis van de democratie\\" (2007); \\"Taal, onderwijs en de samenleving\\" (with Piet Van Avermaet); \\"De 360¬∞-werknemer\\" (2012, with Paul Mutsaers & Hans Siebers). Blommaert's oeuvre in Dutch has also contributed to the debate on the status of the left on the political spectrum.See for instance \\"Socialisme voor [her]beginners\\" (2010); \\"De heruitvinding van de samenleving\\" (2011); \\"Links van de Kerk. De linkerzijde en de multiculturele samenleving\\" (2011) - all published by EPO in Berchem.  Language and society  Blommaert argues that under globalized conditions, our basic understanding of language and society needs to be redefined, and the discipline of sociolinguistics to move in more materialist, semiotic, and ethnographic directions: all signs, whether written texts, shop inscriptions, internet memes, or bureaucratic interviews, are produced from and circulating within particular \\"orders of indexicality\\". Blommaert emphasizes the unequal access to universally valuable linguistic resources such as standard English or Dutch, and the social and political injustices as a result. Illustrations of this are given in his 2008 book, Grassroots Literacy, on marginal writing practices in Central Africa.  Sociolinguistics of globalization  Since 2002, Blommaert moved towards a sociolinguistics of globalization, which was basically a new platform for thinking about language in society taking in mind the fact that \\"old sociolinguistics\\" and its terminology could no longer address and do justice to new and unstable sociolinguistic realities, resulting from superdiversity.Blommaert, J. \\"Commentary: A sociolinguistics of globalization.\\" Special Issue: Sociolinguistics and Globalization, Journal of Sociolinguistics, Volume 7, Issue 4, pages 607‚Äì623, November 2003 Blommaert, drawing on Vertovec described this superdiversity in terms of an increased mobility and an explosion of new technologies so that consequently, the idea of stability in social, cultural and linguistic formations can no longer be presupposed because of the disappearance of predictability.Blommaert, J. & Rampton, B. Language and Superdiversity. Diversities. 2011, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. , UNESCO. ISSN 2079-6595 This superdiversity leads to issues of complexity, and Blommaert addressed these issues in Chronicles of Complexity, in which he argues that seemingly 'chaotic' sociolinguistics environments, turn out to have a particular (but changing) order.  Ethnography  The key to Blommaert's work is 'ethnography', including issues on methodology and empirical practice. Ethnography is however not reduced to those elements, but rather sketched as a paradigm, a robust theoretical and methodological framework through which the world is observed. To achieve such a wide view, Blommaert argues for a historical and patterned understanding of real language usage in society. To build the historical component, he frequently draws on Bourdieu's oeuvre, arguing that precisely because of its eclectic methodological approach (ranging from observations to long-term surveys etc.) it is ethnographic; on Braudel, rethinking his concept of 'longue duree' for considering sociolinguistic complexity, and Wallerstein's views on the compression of time and space in World Systems Analysis. To build the patterned component, Blommaert largely draws on Dell Hymes' concept of ethnopoetics, a methodological instrument to analyze narratives in patterned ways. As for Hymes, Blommaert recognizes unfamiliar patterns to have a relevant and particular structure to the speaker, but finds that they are mis- recognized in e.g. bureaucratic encounters, in situations where \\"systems of meaning-making meet\\".Blommaert, J. 2006. Ethnopoetics as functional reconstruction: Dell Hymes narrative view of the world. Functions of Language, Volume 13, Issue 2, pp. 229‚Äì249. John Benjamins Publishing Company But whereas Hymes largely focused on print data and the reanalysis of others' data, Blommaert refined the methodology by using first-hand, real-life data from Belgian asylum seekers and subsequently developed an applied ethnopoetics.

He spent his childhood in Selenge Province. He was educated at Ural State University in Russia as an electrical engineer with a concentration on automation and telemetry from 1984 to 1989. Later, he earned a diploma of law from the National University of Mongolia in 1996 and graduated with an IMBA from the University of Denver in 2004. Although he joined the pro-democracy movement in late 1989 and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party in 1990, Enkhbold emerged on the political scene in 1996 when he was appointed as the Chairman of State Property Committee, the government agency responsible for the administration of the privatization process in Mongolia. After electoral defeat in 2000, Enkhbold was elected as secretary-general of the Democratic Party (Mongolia) (DP). However, he resigned from his post after the DP lost the 2001 presidential election. Enkhbold assumed his seat in parliament from √ñv√∂rkhangai Province in 2005. He was one of three sponsors of the controversial Windfall Profits Tax that was abolished when the Mongolian government signed an Investment Agreement for the Oyu Tolgoi mine. During his third parliamentary term, he served as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Security and Foreign Policy from 2008-2011. Enkhbold has been perceived and has maintained his image as a brave, honest, and disinterested politician. Unlike most leaders in the DP, he has been much less involved in deals between the DP and the Mongolian People's Party (MPP) since 2004 and did not serve as a cabinet member in the coalition governments of 2004 and 2008. Moreover, Enkhbold has often come to public attention through his questions and statements about misconduct of politicians, often including fellow DP members. In 2012, Enkhbold founded ‚ÄúShonkhor‚Äù (Falcon), an influential faction within the DP. Enkhbold was a co-author of the new parliamentary election law of early 2012 that introduced a mix of majoritarian districts and proportional representation, a women's quota for candidates, electronic counting of ballots, and more stringent requirements for candidates and party platforms.

When it went public in 1987, Lillian Vernon Corporation was the first company traded on the American Stock Exchange founded by a woman. New York University's Lillian Vernon Writers House is named after her and houses the University's prestigious creative writing program. Early life Lillian Vernon was born Lilli Menasche in Leipzig, Germany in 1927 to Erna Feiner Menasche and Herman Menasche, a successful dry goods merchant (she later changed her name to Vernon, borrowing it from Mount Vernon, New York, where she settled with her first husband Samuel Hochberg). In 1933, Vernon's brother was attacked by an anti-Jewish mob, and the family fled Nazi Germany to Amsterdam.Mehnert, Ute. \\"Lillian Vernon (1927-2015)\\".

The family emigrated to the United States in 1937.Witchel, Alex. \\"Sometimes a Great Notion\\", The New York Times, January 16, 1997. Taking up residence in New York City, her father, Herman Menasche, sold lingerie and later established a manufacturing company that specialized in leather goods, many of which were designed by Vernon. Vernon became a U.S. citizen in 1942. Her brother, Fred Menasche, later enlisted in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and she joined a Woman's Auxiliary Canteen in support of the war effort. Fred Menasche, serving in Normandy, was killed in a grenade attack. Vernon attended New York University from 1947 to 1949. In 1949, Vernon married Samuel Hochberg, who worked in his parents' women's clothing store. To supplement their family income, Vernon started a mail order service from the kitchen of her Mount Vernon home. She named the service the Vernon Specialties Company.National Women's History Museum.

Business career  Lillian Vernon Corporation  At the age of twenty- four, using her combined wedding gifts, Vernon invested $2,000 in the business and placed her first advertisement in Seventeen magazine for personalized purses and belts.Cruice, Valerie. \\"Starting Simply: the Story of a Business\\" The New York Times. May 24, 1998. She received an overwhelming response and her business was launched. In the first years, the size of the business was limited to Vernon and her kitchen table, where she sorted and filled orders. The Vernon Specialties Company focused primarily on products for young women, advertising in magazines focused on that emergent market. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Vernon and Hochberg began to create their own jewelry, which they sold through the catalog. One particularly successful product, a magnetized bobby pin cup, attracted the interest of Revlon in 1962. Revlon offered them a distribution contract shortly thereafter. Other cosmetics companies including Elizabeth Arden, Max Factor, and Maybelline followed suit.Mehnert. In 1969, Hochberg and Vernon divorced and split the company, with Hochberg taking over the wholesale division and Vernon continuing the catalog.Coleman, Lisa and Meeks, Fleming. \\"I Just Went Out And Did It.\\" Forbes. August 17, 1992. In the 1970s, the company began to retool its strategy to draw from, and sell to, a global market. Lillian Vernon began to travel to European trade fairs in an effort to expand the catalog's offerings to include European products. In 1980, Vernon was one of the first American merchants to travel to China after President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit. In order to expand her brand, Vernon started The New Company, a brass manufacturer, and Provender, the Lillian Vernon Company's wholesale division, which sold Lillian Vernon brand toiletries and kitchen supplies. The Lillian Vernon Corporation, founded in 1965, went public in 1987, making her the first woman to found a company publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Lillian Vernon Catalog, which the company launched in 1956,Mehnert became an iconic shopping resource for American women, much like its competitor, the Sears catalog. Produced monthly, the catalog was typically 120 pages and usually featured 750 items. In response to a catalog and shopping mall boom in the United States in the 1980s, the company produced a number of specialty catalogs in order to broaden its market, including ones targeted for children and homemakers.Cherry, Robin. Catalog: The Illustrated History of Mail-Order Shopping. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2008. Responding to the increasingly important online market in the early 1990s, the Lillian Vernon Corporation opened a storefront on AOL in 1995 and followed with an online catalog and website. However, by the end of the 1990s, the company began to struggle to meet online needs, especially after the collapse of the dot-com bubble. After Fred and David Hochberg both declined to take over running the company, Vernon sold it to Zelnick Media in 2003, but retained the symbolic title of non-executive chairman. The company has since changed hands a number of times. it is owned by the Taylor Corporation.De la Merced, Michael. ‚ÄúBankruptcy Protection for Retailer‚Äù, nytimes.com, May 3, 2008. Later career In 1997, Vernon was appointed to head President Bill Clinton's White House National Business Women's Council, which she became the chairwoman of for many years. She was the first member of the American Business Conference. She has been a strong supporter of the Democratic Party for many years, supporting the presidential campaigns of President Clinton, President Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, among others.

It was released in August 2012 for Microsoft Windows, and in November 2012 for OS X. The game employs a modified version of id Software's 1997-era id Tech 2 engine‚Äîoriginally used for Quake 2‚Äîand incorporates music composed by Idle Thumbs member Chris Remo. It follows three people as they prepare for an alcohol heist and the aftermath of the operation. The game is a non-direct sequel to Gravity Bone (2008) and features the same main character‚Äîan unnamed spy. It was developed as part of the Kickstarter campaign for the revival of the Idle Thumbs podcast and included a free copy of its predecessor. Thirty Flights of Loving received generally favorable reviews from video game media outlets, scoring 88 out of 100 on aggregate website Metacritic. A follow-up, Quadrilateral Cowboy, was released on July 25, 2016.  Gameplay  Thirty Flights of Loving is a first-person adventure video game that is estimated to take about 15 minutes on average to complete. Using the WASD keys and mouse, the player controls the main character, an unnamed spy who participates in an alcohol-smuggling operation. The player works alongside non-playable characters Anita, a demolitions expert, and Borges, a forger. The game follows the group as they prepare for a heist and experience its aftermath. The robbery is omitted from the game, although it is revealed that it went wrong. Thirty Flights uses the same blocky style of art as Gravity Bone. Here, the player and Borges are in their hideout, planning the heist. Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs non-linear storytelling, forcing the player to piece together the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.  Story  Thirty Flights of Loving begins with the player walking through a small corridor where individual gameplay elements such as movement and key allocations are explained. After walking through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A smash cut skips the narrative forward to a scene with Anita and Borges lying shot in a room full of crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what looks to be an airport. The player is then taken to a dark room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After walking through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding. Anita and the player get drunk on a table while the rest of the characters start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.  Development  Brendon Chung, developer of Thirty Flights of Loving Thirty Flights of Loving was developed by Brendon Chung's video game studio Blendo Games. Chung, who worked as a level designer for Pandemic Studios, has contributed to the development of Full Spectrum Warrior and Lord of the Rings: Conquest. Thirty Flights of Loving was created using a modified version of KMQuake II, a port of id Software's id Tech 2, the graphics engine for Quake 2. It incorporates a gameplay enhancement add-on named Lazarus, developed by David Hyde and Mad Dog. Chung acknowledged that although he has worked with newer, \\"powerful and flexible\\" engines, he preferred the older engine because it was released as an open-source platform, \\"so you can redistribute it for free.\\" The source code of Thirty Flights of Loving itself has been released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License, making it free software. The game was first conceived as a prototype to Gravity Bone, and was scrapped because it was \\"too dialogue heavy.\\" However, Chung revived the idea after being contacted by Idle Thumbs to develop a game for their Kickstarter campaign. The main development phase, in which content creation took place, was finished within three months. Several more months were spent polishing the game and fixing software bugs. Chung brought multiple existing assets from Gravity Bone to develop Thirty Flights of Loving, and used a diverse set of tools to create the elements of the game. Blender was picked for the creation of models, while Audacity and Adobe Photoshop were used for audio and texture work. Another tool, GtkRadiant, was used to create the game's levels. Chung developed Thirty Flights of Loving environment as a way to present the criminal nature of the group. He intentionally avoided the use of voice-overs, and instead modeled the environment to bridge \\"the disconnect between the player's knowledge and the player's character's knowledge.\\" Characters Anita and Borges were to be introduced using dialogue, but this was removed. However, montages were later added after Idle Thumbs' crew expressed concerns that the characters' relationships were unclear. Chung included a system to automate the generation of non-playable characters to replace the process of manually scripting every person in the game. He explained that although it allows characters to \\"randomly wander near waypoints,\\" the software is \\"occasionally glitchy and behaves badly around staircases.\\" This automation code was originally developed for a surveillance game prototype \\"that never panned out.\\" A first- person meal simulator was designed for Thirty Flights of Loving. The sequence included the main characters \\"enjoy[ing] street noodles.\\" However, the idea was scrapped and replaced with the motorcycle ride featured in the final version. The gunfight scene portrayed in the game was supposed to have a \\"musical rhythm,\\" inspired by the film Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. The last level of the game is modeled from the French National Museum of Natural History. Chung explained that when developing levels, he first spends time researching and \\"learning how things work.\\" He elaborated that researching is important in \\"how it gives specificity and grounding\\" to a game. Thirty Flights of Loving is the seventh \\"Citizen Abel\\" game developed by Chung. The first two games were coded in 1999, while the following three were written between 2000 and 2004. The sixth game in the series, Gravity Bone (2008), became the first to be published. On the Tone Control podcast, he spoke about how every game he has produced, including Thirty Flights of Loving, takes place in the same shared universe. Thirty Flights of Loving includes references and Easter eggs, as did Gravity Bone. Films such as Three Days of the Condor and The Conversation, film directors Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino, games such as Zork and Saints Row: The Third, and animated shows like Animaniacs and TaleSpin are referenced in the campaign. Unlike most of Chung's previous games, Thirty Flights of Loving was not framed around a certain musical composition. It incorporates music composed by Idle Thumbs member Chris Remo, while additional audio was provided by Jared Emerson- Johnson and A.J. Locascio. It makes use of Soundsnap's sound library.  Release  Thirty Flights of Loving was announced in February 2012 as part of the Kickstarter campaign for Idle Thumbs' podcast. The Idle Thumbs team talked to Chung about a possible sequel to Gravity Bone, which was offered as one of the rewards of their Kickstarter campaign. Those who supported the campaign received Thirty Flights of Loving before its official release in August 2012. They also gained access to an exclusive \\"Goldblum mode\\" that was not part of the general release. It replaced the character model with ones resembling actor Jeff Goldblum. The game, alongside a free copy of Gravity Bone, was made available to early supporters in July 2012 and to the general public a month later via Steam. A Mac OS X release followed in November 2012.  Reception  Thirty Flights of Loving received generally favorable reviews upon release. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 88 out of 100, based on 10 reviews. Destructoid Patrick Hancock awarded the game 9.5 out of 10, stating that \\"you'll never look at linear storytelling the same way again.\\" GameSpot's Carolyn Petit wrote that \\"the pleasure of Thirty Flights of Loving emerges from the things left unshown\\", allowing the player to infer and imagine the events, such as the heist itself, that are not otherwise shown. Graham Smith of PC Gamer extolled the minimalist storytelling, asserting that Thirty Flights of Loving \\"tells a better story in 13 minutes than most games do in 13 hours\\". Mark Brown from Wired UK classified the game as a \\"brassy, super-short, cubic heist drama,\\" and stated that Chung \\"spins a memorable yarn, delivers it with confidence and panache [...] with a 15-year-old engine, without voice acting, in 20 minutes.\\" IGN's Nathan Meunier said the game \\"gets off to a fascinating start before completely throwing any and all expectations you might form during its first few minutes into the wood chipper.\\" British video game magazine Edge found Thirty Flights of Loving to be \\"an intriguing psychological thriller that feels like Wes Anderson taking on Hitchcock.\\" The magazine added that the game had a \\"wonderfully ambiguous\\" story, crafted by replacing dialogue with \\"artful framing and shrewd gestures, and booting out cutscenes in favour of prickly jump-cuts.\\" Greek magazine PC Master praised the game's storytelling and stated that Thirty Flights of Loving \\"attempts to blur the lines between gaming and art.\\" Thirty Flights of Loving was a Narrative Award finalist at the 2013 Independent Games Festival. However, Richard Hofmeier's Cart Life (2011) became the winner.  Sequel  A follow- up to Thirty Flights of Loving, Quadrilateral Cowboy, was developed by Chung. The game takes place in the same universe as Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving but is not a direct sequel. It follows a hacker who oversees agents who infiltrate buildings and steal documents. Unlike its predecessors, Quadrilateral Cowboy uses id Software's id Tech 4 engine‚Äîoriginally used for Doom 3. According to Chung, the new engine provides \\"a lot more modern functionality\\" than the earlier engine used in the first two games.

It was a vibrant administrative, religious and cultural centre from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD that is from the Maurya Empire time to the Sena dynasty period. Archaeological remains and literary descriptions speak of a truly planned and magnificent city. City walls, elaborate gates, palaces, common dwellings, assembly halls, temples, viharas, shops, ponds and even suburban temples and viharas characterised the city; Chinese pilgrim, Xuanzang (Hiuen tsang), visiting in the 7th century AD, particularly mentions ponds, orchards, flowers and pleasure gardens.Haque, Saif Ul ; Ahsan, Raziul ; Ashraf, Kazi Khaleed;, Pundranagar to Sherebanglanagar : architecture in Bangladesh, 1997, pp. 11. Pundanagar within the Pundravardhana Bhukti suggests it to have been a part of the early historical empires ‚Äì both Hindu and Buddhist. During the Muslim period the site was not forsaken looking for a new place as was their tradition. The physical feature and the strategic importance of the place must have been of higher priority in the selection process. But the fact that the settlement pattern of the Hindu-Buddhist Period did not hinder in any way their own settlements within the same wall proves that at least in architecture and living way there was a continuity of form and technique which never died out of the Bengalese both liberal and secular. Etymology There are several theories regarding the word 'Pundra'. According to one theory the word 'Pundra' owes its origin to a disease called 'Pandu'. The land where most of the people were suffering from that disease was called Pundrakshetra (land of Pundra). Punda is a species of sugarcane. The land where that species of sugarcane was extensively cultivated was called Pundadesa (land of Punda). According to later Vedic texts like Aitereya Aryanaka of 8th‚Äì7th century BC, the Pundra was a group of non-Aryan people who lived east of the river Sadanira. The Mahabharata also made a similar reference. In the 1st century AD, the land was mentioned as Pundravardhana for the first time in Asokadana.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, Mahasthan: Anecdote to History, 2006, pp. 69‚Äì73, Dibyaprakash, 38/2 ka Bangla Bazar, Dhaka, . Geography Some 10 kilometre northeast of Bogra stands Mahasthan, on the banks of the river Karatoya celebrated in ancient literature as a scared river. Karatoya was once a mighty river before its parent stream ‚Äì the Teesta or Trisrota (meaning combined flow of three rivers ‚Äì the Karatoya, the Pundrabhava and the Atrai) flowing down from the Jalpaiguri suddenly shifted its old channel and rushed into the Brahmaputra (Jamuna) in the devastating flood of 1787 AD. Mahasthan or Pundranagar was an important location on a major north south navigation as can be seen in James Rennell's map of Bengal drawn in 1767. It was an impressive fortified citadel enclosed on the south, the west and part of north by a deep moat. Its eastern and part of its northern rampart overlooked the mighty Karatoya. Looking at the dried up skeleton of the river today, one can hardly have any idea of what great role Karatoya played on ancient history of this region. The Karatoya is mentioned in the great epic Mahabharata. A 12th/13th century Sanskrit text, called Karatoya Mahatyam, ascribed to Parsurama, celebrates this river which is described as big as a sea. The Karatoya-Teesta navigation system was the route followed by Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji when he tried to conquer Tibet in 1205/06. A Persian source mentions an army sailing down the river in the 16th century. So it can be surmised that the importance of Pundranagar was due to its location as an important stage in the north-south fluvial axis from the Bay to Nepal and Tibet.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 58‚Äì59. It is also believed that the location for the city in the area was decided upon because it is one of the highest areas in Bangladesh. The land in the region is almost 36 m above sea level, whereas Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is around 6 m above sea level. History The Arthashastra of Kautilya, mentioned about the Silk of Pundra which was smooth like emerald and also similar to Magadhi Silk . Varahamihira, writing in the 6th century AD, mentions in his Brhatsamhita the name of six janapadas in the eastern region: Paundra. Vanga, Samatata, Vardhamana, Gaudaka and Tamraliptaka. Important cities and settlements characterised as janapadas. Pundranagar in Paundrabhukti was the most important city in the eastern region, now identified with the current site of Mahasthan.Haque, Saif Ul ; Ahsan, Raziul ; Ashraf, Kazi Khaleed;, Pundranagar to Sherebanglanagar : architecture in Bangladesh, 1997, p. 11. The excavations at Pundranagar till today revealed seven period of occupation. The remnants of these periods are important and show how these finds created a total period of its history.Architecture, Asiatic Society, pp. 562 Along with the discoveries of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW) pottery whose date is known to vary from the 4th century BC to 2nd century BC points to Pundranagar's Buddhist past during the Mauryan rule in the Sub-continent, there is another very strong evidence of its Buddhist past that comes from the accounts of the Chinese pilgrim, Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang). He visited Pundranagar between the years 638 AD and 645 AD. Xuanzang noticed a large stupa near the city which he called Po-Shi-Po. From his descriptions it appears that the site mentioned by him is the Vasu-Vihara, a Buddhist educational institution. Here Ashoka is said to have erected a large stupa on the body relic of the Enlightened One. The Chinese pilgrim claims in his account that Buddha himself came and stayed here for three months preaching his religion. All these references conclusively establish Pundranagar's close association with the Mauryan rule. With the dissolution of the Mauryan rule what happened to Pundranagar is still a matter of conjecture. Precise historical records are not available for the Shunga phase which is roughly between the 1st century BC and 73 BC. But the discovery of terracotta figurines assigned to this period strongly suggests that the city of Pundranagar continued to flourish during this period. The discovery of a gold coin bearing the bearded figure of Kanishka on the obverse suggests its association with the Kushanas but it does not conclusively prove their sway over Pundranagar. However, epigraphic records suggest that from the 4th century onward Bengal came to be subjugated by the Guptas and Pundranagar came to be regarded as the stronghold of Gupta defences in the eastern flank of their empire. The Damodarpur copper plate of Buddha Gupta suggests that Pundranagar flourished as the capital of the entire northern Bengal and it formed an integral part of the Gupta empire down to the end of the 5th century. In the early 7th century Shashanka who established an independent rule in Gauda undertook a systematic persecution of the Buddhists and during this period Pundranagar's strong Buddhist influence may have suffered an eclipse. It is, however, with the rise of the Palas that Pundranagar once again became the seat of an independent government under Gopala. Though his son Dharmapala shifted his capital to Magadha, Pundranagar continued to thrive under the Palas. Its prosperity continued unabated until the coming of the Muslims in the early 13th century. The Bengal Sultans established' their capital in Gauda region. Pundranagar was abandoned and left to fall into decay and ruin.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 60‚Äì61. Bangladesh-France joint ventures were conducting excavation with much success since 1993, and until recently the joint mission could unearth eighteen construction layers in the course of excavation. The cultural artefacts obtained from the excavation results could be classified under the following period-heads.Mahasthan, Banglapedia, (Dhaka: Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, 2003), pp. 346ff. First period In this period as the remnants of the pre-Mauryan era a large number of Northern Black Polished Wares, Rouletted wares, black and red pottery, black hued polished pots, stone-blocks, mud houses with mud floors, cooking furnace and pillar-pits are reported to have been found in the excavated spots. This was possibly the first human habitation on Pleistocene landscape known as the Barind Tract in the pre- Mauryan times.JBA, p. 75. Second period The artefacts which were found of this age are broken tiles, the brickbats, potsherds, ring stones, bronze- mirrors, bronze lamps, dice-cast coins, terracotta plaques and stone beads representing the characteristics of the Mauryan period. Third period This is the post-Mauryan age covering the Shunga and Kushana periods. Of the periods the remnants of big and well-protected brick-built structures, the brick-strewn floors, pillar-pits, the terracotta plaques of the Shunga period, the semi-precious stones and beads, the temples' pinnacles and other such artefacts are reported to have been noticed. Fourth period In this age are unearthed the antiquarian relics of the Kushan-Gupta periods. A large number of broken clay-pots, artistic terracotta plaques with various figures, the decorated cooking-pots, the dishes and other such items of importance are traced. The architectural remnants of this layer are comparatively less than those of upper and lower layers. Moreover, semi- precious stone and glass beads, dishes and terracotta seals are worth mentioning objects of cultural importance of this age. Fifth period This period represents the Gupta and late Gupta phase. The phase yielded remains of a massive brick structure of a temple called Govinda Bhita, located close to the fort-city, belonging to the late Gupta period, as well as other brick structures ‚Äì houses, floors, streets in the city, and huge antiquities, including terracotta plaques of the characteristic style, seals, beads of terracotta, glass and semi-precious stones, terracotta balls, copper and iron objects and stamped wares. Sixth period This period represents the Pala-Sena phase evidenced by architectural remains of several sites scattered throughout the eastern side of the city like Khodar Pathar Bhita, Mankalir Kunda, Parasuram's palace and Bairagir Bhita. This was the most flourishing phase and during this period a large number of Buddhist establishments were erected outside the city. Seventh period This period represents the Muslim phase testified by the architectural remains of a fifteen-domed mosque of the Sultanate period, a single domed mosque built by Farrukh Siyar, the Mughal emperor, and other antiquities like Chinese celadon and glazed ware typical of the age. Bairagir Bhita, Khodar Pathar Bhita, Munkalir Kunda Mound, Parsuram's palace mound and Jiat Kunda are some sites inside the city which have yielded archaeological objects of interest.Banglapedia, pp. 348‚Äì349. Citadel A visitor to Mahasthan / Pundranagar is impressed by the city walls enclosing an area of 22,500,000 sq. feet. The citadel (see map alongside), the fortified heart of the ancient city, is rectangular in plan, measuring roughly 1.523 km long from north to south, and 1.371 km from east to west, with high and wide ramparts in all its wings. The Karatoya, once a mighty river but now a small stream, flows on its east but the presence of other ruins and mounds around suggest that the citadel had flourishing suburbs.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 61. At present there are several mounds and structural vestiges inside the fortifications. Of these a few of note are: Jiat Kunda (well possessing life giving power), Mankalir Dhap (place consecrated to Mankali), Parasuramer Basgriha (palace of a king named Parasuram), Bairagir Bhita (palace of a female anchorite), Khodar Pathar Bhita (place of stone bestowed by God), and Munir Ghon (a bastion). There are some gateways at different points: Kata Duar (in the north), Dorab Shah Toran (in the east), Burir Fatak (in the south), and Tamra Dawaza (in the west).Brochure: Mahasthan ‚Äì the earliest city-site of Bangladesh, published by the Department of Archaeology, Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Government of the People‚Äôs Republic of Bangladesh, 2003 Besides these, there are 31 other sites and mounds around Mahasthan.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 61. Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) visiting Pundranagar in the mid-7th century observed that its circumference was about five miles (30 li). He noticed about 20 Buddhist monasteries accommodating some 3000 monks and about 100 Brahmanical temples, but the greater numbers of heretics were Nirgrantha (Jaina) who went about naked. Sandhyakar Nandi writing in the middle of the 12th century has drawn a glorious picture of the city in his Ramacharita as 'the crown jewel of Varenda'. The splendours of the city's royal palaces, state secretariate, mansions, luxurious villas of the noblemen and merchants, flourishing marts, ornate temples, assembly halls, the garrison within the heavily fortified city ramparts and moats as portrayed by him seem to be no less brilliant than Vaisali, Rajagriha, Sravasti, Kausambi, Pataliputra or any other famous ancient cities of Aryavarta during the early historic period. The poet further mentioned that the social workers, labourers and the dwellings of the middle class citizens were located in its extensive suburbs outside the protected area of the citadel. The excavation and exploration in its ambient areas agree exactly with the descriptions of Sandhyakar Nandi.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 61‚Äì62. Discovery Punadranagar which was first discovered by Sir Alexander Cunningham who visited the place in 1879 and was not pleased to see the site. Sir Alexander Cunningham wrote; But Sir Alexander was correct in assuming that the Chinese pilgrim's description of Pundravardhana (Pan-na-fa-tan-na as he wrote in Chinese) came close to this walled city in ruins. He observed that its circumference was about eight miles. However, behind what Cunningham considered a 'waste of time and money' lay the glorious heritage of a nation that needed to be discovered.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 59. Explorations and excavations Explorations during the British period under the direction of K.N.Dixit and during the Pakistan period under N. Ahmed have led to a renewed interest in the past of a nation that can now trace its history back to the 4th century BC. A French archaeological team has been busy with the exploration of the site since 1991 under Jean- Francois Salle. The team has done some valuable work dividing excavation into six phases and it is now definitely understood that the site shows 'a continuous occupation from its lowest layers to its abandon in the 13th century; the details of the levels are still to 'be studied and measured accurately, and when completed, the stratigraphical sequence will provide a unique reference system for the whole of East India where no other site has ever yielded such a comparable and rich stratigraphy The French have for the first time put things on a scientific basis having done some C14 dating. Phase 5 of their excavation work of the northern building provided 'two C14 dates of the 1st and 2nd century AD'. This is confirmed by archaeological materials such as cast copper coins of Mauryan type still in use in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, numerous terracotta plaques of Shunga style, and a large variety of Black Polished Ware. The discovery of this N.B.P. pottery whose date is known to vary from the 4th century BC to 2nd century BC points to Pundranagar's Buddhist past during the Mauryan rule in the Sub-continent. The discovery of a limestone tablet from Mahasthan in 1931 confirms this. The tablet bears six lines of Ashokan Brahmi inscription directing the Mahamatra (governor) of Pundranagar to distribute food grain and money from government stores to the famine- stricken people of the area. The sympathy evinced in the inscription strongly suggests that this was an imperial order from Ashoka himself.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 59‚Äì60. Excavations in 1907 and 1961 exposed the plan of a dwelling house which is comparatively modern and is ascribes to the later 18th century or early 19th century. But a deep trench dug at a later date revealed a fragmentary building phases of an earlier date, probably 8th century AD.Khan, Enayetullah, Bangladesh, splendours of the past, pp. 63‚Äì64.

Regular season The modern era of college basketball unofficially began with the 1945-46 season and the University of Illinois was quick to offer a team that was rebuilding its post-war image to that of a contender. Future hall of fame coaches Johnny Orr and Vic Bubas left the team to join in with the war effort as did Walt Kersulis, a top 5 scorer from the previous season and Consensus First-Team All-American and team captain Walt Kirk. The addition of freshman Bob Doster and Dwight Humphrey to a lineup that included team Jack Burmaster, Robert Rowe and Walter Mroz became formidable opponents to every team they played including a no. 1 ranked DePaul. On December 29, 1945, the Fighting Illini took on George Mikan's Blue Demons, who had lost just eight games in three years, and defeated them by a score of 56-37. In the game Burmaster and Doster each scored 14 points with Mroz adding 11 in the second half. The victory proved that, even without team captain Kirk, who had gone to serve in the armed services, the young team was ready to take on all comers. The 1945 Blue Demons went on to win the 1945 National Invitation Tournament. Additionally, the 1945-46 season would be the finale for the University of Chicago as part of the Big Ten. Illinois would defeat the Maroons two times during the year, 70-28 and 85-24. Due to the departure of Chicago, the Big Ten would become the Big Nine until Michigan State joined the conference in 1950. Mills used 31 players during the course of the season and had an overall record of 14 wins and 7 losses with a conference mark of 7 and 5, finishing in a fifth place tie in the Big Ten. The team finished with an 11 - 2 record at home and a road record of 3 - 5. Future All-American Dwight \\"Dike\\" Eddleman would appear in two games during the course of the season, as well as future North Carolina A&T; Aggies, hall-of- fame men's basketball coach, Cal Irvin, would appear in one game. David \\"Matt\\" Bullock 1946 saw the end of a 34-year career for Illini athletic trainer Matt Bullock. From 1913-47 David ‚ÄúMatt‚Äù Bullock saw to it that football and basketball stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Buddy Young, Ray Woods, Chuck Carney, Lou Boudreau, Andy Phillip and other Fighting Illini stayed healthy. During his long career at the University of Illinois, Bullock cared for more than 40,000 athletes.

He became notorious for his abusive treatment of his second wife, Mary Molesworth.  Early life  He was the son of Rt. Hon. George Rochfort (son of Robert Rochfort), and Lady Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Henry Hamilton-Moore, 3rd Earl of Drogheda. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Westmeath between 1731 and 1738.E. M. Johnston-Liik, MPs in Dublin: Companion to History of the Irish Parliament, 1692-1800 (Ulster Historical Foundation, 2006), p.119 (Retrieved 25 October 2016). On 16 March 1738, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Belfield and assumed his seat in the Irish House of Lords, quickly becoming a favourite in the court of George II of Great Britain. In 1746, Belfield was challenged to a duel on account of a long-due debt of honour by Richard Herbert MP. The duel took place in the fields between Tottenham Court Road and Marylebone on Saturday 23 August 1746. Belfield was badly wounded, and Herbert received a ball in the eye which came out at the back of the skull, but nevertheless he survived, although mentally he was never the same man again. On 12 December 1749, he was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. On 5 October 1751, he was made Viscount Belfield, and he was further honoured when he was created Earl of Belvedere on 29 November 1756.E. M. Johnston-Liik, MPs in Dublin: Companion to History of the Irish Parliament, 1692-1800 (Ulster Historical Foundation, 2006), p.119 (Retrieved 25 October 2016). Lord Belfield held the office of Muster Master-General of Ireland between 1754 and his death in 1774. He commissioned the construction of Belvedere House and Gardens in 1740.  Marriages and ordeals  He married, firstly, Elizabeth Tenison, daughter of Richard Tenison and Margaret Barton, on 16 December 1731, and she died a year later in 1732 from smallpox. He married, secondly, Hon. Mary Molesworth, daughter of Field Marshal Richard Molesworth, 3rd Viscount Molesworth and Jane Lucas, on 7 August 1736. Despite his fairly rapid rise at court and in politics, Rochfort is probably most well remembered for his treatment of his second wife Mary, whom he married in 1736 when he was 28 and she 16. Around 1743, he heard rumours that Mary had been unfaithful to him with his brother, Arthur. As punishment, Robert had her locked up in the family house at Gaulstown, alone apart from her servants, for the rest of his life (thirty-one years). After twelve years of this captivity, she had attempted to escape but was caught and subjected to even harsher treatment. When she was finally released by order of her son after his father's death, she apparently took to wandering the house and talking to portraits as if they were real people. Her voice had assumed a peculiar quality (like a shrill whisper) and she was obviously profoundly damaged by her experience. She did not survive long after her release. She was not the only one to suffer though, as Robert took his brother Arthur to court for criminal conversation and was awarded the then huge sum of ¬£2,000 in damages. Arthur, unable to pay, fled the country, but on his return to Ireland, he was thrown into Browne's CastleBrowne's Castle, a former pub known as \\"The Black Dog\\", (used as Dublin's debtors' prison at that time, and famous for being \\"the worst prison in the country\\",) where he died. Lord Belvedere was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son from his second marriage, George Rochfort. He had two other sons, Richard and Robert, and a daughter Jane who married firstly Brinsley Butler, 2nd Earl of Lanesborough and secondly John King.  Death  Rochfort died on aged 66. The cause of his death is not clear but some speculated that occupants of a boat came ashore to Belvedere House after crossing Lough Ennell, and murdered Rochfort in the dead of the night while others state that while on a moonlit walk, he was attacked by wild dogs; or he could have fallen and struck his head on a rock, and possibly bled to death.

Early years Born in San Jose, California, Meggs graduated from Saratoga High School in Saratoga and played college baseball at UCLA, starting at third base all four years. He was honorable mention All-Conference in 1983, and drafted after both his junior and senior years. Selected in the 15th round of the 1984 MLB Draft, Meggs signed with the Kansas City Royals and enjoyed a brief professional career before returning to UCLA to complete his degree. Coaching career After his playing career ended, Meggs began coaching at De Anza College in Cupertino, serving as an assistant for a season in 1988 before moving south to California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks for another season. Meggs earned his first head coaching opportunity at Oxnard College where he worked for one year in 1990, then moved to Long Beach City College for three seasons. At LBCC, his teams went 75‚Äì51‚Äì1 () and made the playoffs each year. Chico State Meggs moved north to Cal State Chico in 1994, where he was head coach for 13 years. The Wildcats were a Division II national power under him, winning two national championships, appearing seven times in the Division II College World Series, and claiming eight conference titles. Meggs was Division II National Coach of the Year twice, and regional and conference coach of the year seven times each. The Wildcats' home venue, Ray Bohler Field, was renovated in 1997 and became the 4,200-seat Nettleton Stadium. Indiana State Meggs' success at Chico State landed him a Division I job at Indiana State in Terre Haute, where he worked for three years. The Sycamores were 33‚Äì21 () overall and finished second in the Missouri Valley Conference after being picked to finish sixth in the preseason. Four players were named first team All-Conference that season, with five others earning other conference awards. Meggs was named MVC Coach of the Year for his efforts. Washington In 2009, Meggs was introduced as the new head coach at Washington on July 27. In his first season in 2010, the Huskies were 28‚Äì28, an improvement of five wins over the previous season. Among his efforts at Washington has been seeking additional personal general enhancements, particularly to Husky Ballpark and the Huskies' indoor facilities. After the 2012 season, three additional years were added to his contract, through 2018. Following Washington's runner-up finish in the conference in 2014, Meggs was named Pac-12 coach of the year. Picked in the preseason to finish low in the standings, the Huskies posted a 21-9 record in conference and made their first post-season appearance in a decade. Although ranked in the national top ten for much of the season, Washington was overlooked as a regional host. In the NCAA regional at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Washington was the runner-up, losing two close games to the host Rebels. Both games with Ole Miss were decided by one run and both had over 9,300 in attendance at Swayze Field. (The Rebels won their Super Regional on the road and advanced to semifinals of the College World Series). That summer, Meggs was granted a six-year contract extension at Washington, worth $2.2 million.

Statement A matroid on a set Q is specified by a class of non-empty subsets M of Q, called circuits, such that no element of M contains another, and if X and Y are in M, a is in X and Y, b is in X but not in Y, then there is some Z in M containing b but not a and contained in X‚à™Y. The subsets of Q that are unions of circuits are called flats. The elements of M are called 0-flats, the minimal non-empty flats that are not 0-flats are called 1-flats, the minimal nonempty flats that are not 0-flats or 1-flats are called 2-flats, and so on. A path is a finite sequence of 0-flats such that any two consecutive elements of the path lie in some 1-flat. An elementary path is one of the form (X,Y,X), or (X,Y,Z,X) with X,Y,Z all lying in some 2-flat. Two paths P and Q such that the last 0-flat of P is the same as the first 0-flat of Q can be composed in the obvious way to give a path PQ. Two paths are called homotopic if one can be obtained from the other by the operations of adding or removing elementary paths inside a path, in other words changing a path PR to PQR or vice versa, where Q is elementary. A weak form of Tutte's homotopy theorem states that any closed path is homotopic to the trivial path. A stronger form states a similar result for paths not meeting certain \\"convex\\" subsets.

Furlong was a paleontologist and fossil preparator noted for his work on ancient mammals and the Mesozoic reptiles of California. Furlong was born to a family with deep roots in the California area and spent his childhood in San Francisco. In 1900 he began attending the University of California at Berkeley. The next year he began preparing vertebrate fossils for Berkeley paleontologist John C. Merriam. In 1902 and 1903 Furlong participated into several fossil hunting expeditions to Shasta County. On these expeditions Furlong collected alongside Annie Montague Alexander. Although Furlong himself found several of their combined 43 fossil specimen discoveries, only one has been formally credited solely to him. Furlong did the preparation work on most of the fossils uncovered by the Shasta County expeditions. His preparation work lasted until May, 1910. In 1913 he resumed working with Berkeley's paleontologists. Furlong associated closely with Chester Stock when the latter joined Berkeley in 1919. Furlong went on to do important research into ancient mammals. He became involved in Mesozoic reptile work once more during the late 1930s and early 1940s due to Chester Stock's expeditions into the Panoche Hills during this time. In 1945 Furlong retired and moved to Eugene, Oregon. That same year he was hit by a car. Furlong survived but suffered health complications related to the accident for the rest of his life. Despite retirement and the accident, Furlong continued to contribute to vertebrate paleontology. He died in 1950. The plesiosaur Aphrosaurus furlongi was named after Furlong by Samuel Welles. Furlong may be the most underappreciated man to have ever worked with the UCMP collections. He made significant contributions to those collections, prepared dozens of vertebrate fossil specimens, and did extensive cataloging of the museum's early collections. He also helped save the fossils from destruction as we'll discover shortly. Eustace Leopold Furlong was born in San Francisco, one of at least three children, in 1874. His father, Matthew William Furlong of Rhode Island, was a sea captain who came to California seeking his fortune in the gold fields. Eustace attended San Francisco public schools and prior to enrolling at UC Berkeley, spent a considerable amount of time mining in the Sierra Nevada (probably with his father). Although the vertebrate paleontologists at UCMP are familiar with Eustace, few realize that his older brother by two years, Herbert W. Furlong, was a preparator and field worker for John C. Merriam before Eustace. As a student at Berkeley, Herbert accompanied Merriam on two trips to the John Day region of Oregon and led a successful expedition to Crater Lake in Shasta County. According to an August 3, 1905, article in the Oakland Tribune, Herbert even authored a book called Story in the Sand that was \\"being used throughout the United States as a text book\\" (a Google search brought up no trace of such a book). Unlike Eustace, Herbert did not catch the paleontology bug and pursued other interests following his graduation from Berkeley in 1903. When Herbert left, Eustace stepped into his brother's shoes as preparator and field worker for Merriam. Eustace was a member of Sigma Xi and graduated from Berkeley in 1906. He stayed on at Berkeley as a Geological Assistant (again, this was before there was a Department of Paleontology). Like his brother, Eustace made trips to the John Day and to Shasta County helping to collect specimens. He accompanied Annie Alexander on a number of field trips and became one of her favorites. Two interesting newspaper articles in the Oakland Tribune were found that concern Furlong. This first one, from the September 2, 1905, evening edition (page 1), announced his secret marriage to Ida Hopper in Jackson, California, (apparently he had told no one about it) but it also describes some of his paleontology work. Here is a portion of the article: > PROFESSOR STEALS A MARCH Takes a Bride and Gives Berkeley a Surprise Mr. > Furlong is assistant to Professor John C. Merriam of the Berkeley seat of > learning. His specialty is paleontology, and his original researches in this > line have resulted in discoveries of great interest to the scientific world. > Mr. Furlong has conducted extensive investigations in the Potter Cave > regions of Shasta county and has discovered the names of many cave animals, > which are much like in character to the human life of ancient times. [sic] > Mr. Furlong's investigations have also been conducted in the lime-stone > [sic] formation of the Sierra Nevada region, and in Nevada particularly, > where he has worked with Professor Merriam in finding fossils that are > considered of extraordinary value in the field of paleontology. This summer > Mr. Furlong was again assigned to work in the Shasta regions, but before > beginning his scientific researches he stopped at Ione to claim his promised > bride. After the ceremony, Furlong took his new wife to Shasta County for a somewhat unconventional honeymoon: she got to watch Eustace busy himself with his field work. Ida remained with Eustace until his death and provided him with two daughters. The wedding and Shasta County work took place just a few months after Furlong returned from the Saurian Expedition. The second article concerns an event that took place just before the Saurian Expedition. It appeared in the March 25, 1905, issue of the Tribune: > FIRE THREATENS SOUTH HALL University Building at Berkeley Has Narrow Escape > from Flames Only the timely discovery of Richard Rowe, a janitor at the > University of California, prevented the destruction by fire this morning of > historic South Hall, one of the oldest and largest buildings at the State > University. Aided by Eustace Furlong, an instructor in the Department of > Anthropology [poor reporting], he fought the flames, which started on the > third floor, with buckets of water placed in the hall for just such > emergencies. For a time it seemed as if the flames would get beyond their > control, and an alarm was turned in, to which the University fire department > responded. Rowe and Furlong, with their buckets, however, quenched the > flames and the services of the firemen were not needed. The building is > valued at about $50,000, but on the third and second floors all the > specimens and valuable finds of Professor Merriam, which are of priceless > value to science, are stored. These finds, which represent the latest and > most important work in anthropology [sigh] in America, could never have been > replaced had the fire once swept through the building. The fire started from > crossed electric wires in the dark room of Professor Merriam's department. > Janitor Rowe was at work in the department when the flames burst forth. He > at once gave the alarm and began to fight the fire with the fire buckets. > Furlong came to his aid and the fire was put out. The damage is nominal. So the entire fossil collection that had been amassed by Joseph Le Conte and Merriam up to that time could have been completely destroyed if not for Furlong and an alert janitor! By the time Furlong left the museum in 1910 to try his hand at real estate, he had published six papers, five of them on Pleistocene cave fauna. He was either unsuccessful as a real estate agent or unhappy (or both) because he returned to his assistant position at the museum in 1914. During this second phase at Berkeley, Furlong and his wife lived at 1031 Glendora Avenue in Oakland. In 1921, the year that Annie made an endowment for the creation of a Museum of Paleontology at Berkeley, Furlong was made curator of the vertebrate collections at Annie's recommendation. Furlong served in that capacity until 1927 when he was lured away to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena by Chester Stock and John Buwalda, both former students and collaborators of Merriam's (Merriam had left Berkeley for the Carnegie Institute in Washington, DC, just prior to the creation of the museum). Furlong remained at Cal Tech as a faculty member and curator of paleontology until his retirement in 1945. He published 11 more papers at Cal Tech, some co-authored with Stock. In 1945, Furlong was invited up to the University of Oregon to prepare and study fossil mammals collected in the John Day Basin. While there he was severely injured when a car hit him and from that point on he was unable to walk unaided.

Subsequent intersections are at Irving Street (State Route 1005) and Airport Road. American Parkway continues along the L&NE; right-of-way approximately one-quarter mile to its intersection with Nelson and Columbia Streets. (Google Maps, L&NE; reference) History The idea for a link to Center City Allentown to then-Interstate 78/Lehigh Valley Thruway (now U.S. Route 22) dates back to the 1960s, when Interstate 178 was proposed to link from what was then Interstate 78, but was cancelled due to local opposition in 1971.Pennsylvania's Decommissioned Interstates: I-178 Another proposal for plans of a Route 145 alignment linking the center of the city and the Thruway were abandoned. An article in the Allentown Morning Call in late 1978 described a proposal to build an expressway beginning at Basin Street south of downtown, passing north and east through the center city area, crossing the Lehigh River, and continuing to Airport Road (adjacent to an existing interchange with the Thruway). By 1988, the completed center city section of the \\"American Parkway\\" connected North Front Street with Hamilton Street. The northeastern section of the parkway was built at approximately the same time (~ 2001), but funding was not available to complete the city‚Äôs dream for a fast link between the Thruway and downtown Allentown.  American Parkway Bridge  Opened in November 2015, the American Parkway bridge is approximately one mile in length and the city‚Äôs third crossing of the Lehigh River. The Tilghman Street bridge (1,660 feet in length) and Hamilton Street bridge (315 feet in length) to the south are the only other links between the eastern and western parts of the city. The Tilghman Street bridge was constructed in 1929, and the current Hamilton Street bridge was opened to traffic in 1959, and rebuilt and re-opened on June 19, 1973. Funding and property to construct the bridge and its approaches was secured by the end of 2012, and a contract was let with New Enterprise Stone and Lime of New Enterprise, Bedford County, Pennsylvania to build the span. On December 14, 2012, Allentown's Mayor Ed Pawlowski hosted a groundbreaking ceremony at the future eastern landing of the bridge with members of City Council, United States House of Representatives member Charlie Dent, and other area elected officials and members of the public. On November 24, 2015 at 4:00 p.m., Allentown's Mayor Pawlowski hosted the ribbon-cutting of the bridge, finally providing the long-promised link between Allentown's central core, U.S. Route 22, and Lehigh Valley International Airport. A video showing the westbound drive along the full alignment of American Parkway was published on November 30, 2015.

Guste v. M/V Testbank, 752 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc). As a result of the collision, some hazardous cargo from Testbank was released. Specifically, four cargo containers carrying mixed freight were lost overboard, releasing a significant amount of pentachlorophenol (PCP) into the canal waters. The amount of PCP lost was reported as between 12 and 12.5 tons. There were two other damaged containers containing PCP reported on the deck of Testbank. In addition, a number of barrels containing hydrobromic acid were lost overboard, and others broke open and spilled onto the deck of Testbank, creating a cloud of gas around both ships. Crews were able to clean up the hydrobromic acid within a few days, but the PCP proved to be a greater challenge. Stored in paper sacks, the coarse granules of PCP rapidly sank to the bottom of the channel where visibility was nearly zero. Chemical analysis of the PCP product revealed primarily PCP, tetrachlorphenol and trichlorophenol. Notably, the product also contained several polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, which are known for their toxicity and bioaccumulation. At the time, this was the largest spill of pentachlorophenol in United States history. The United States Coast Guard closed the canal until August 10, 1980. Additionally, all fishing and shrimping operations in a area were temporarily suspended. The Coast Guard ultimately attributed the collision to the helmsman aboard Seadaniel, who was evidently having difficulty controlling the ship immediately before the collision, and failed to notify the ship's pilot, captain or first mate. A length of the canal was closed for six weeks as an estimated $2 million cleanup effort managed to clean up some 90% of the spill. The Port of New Orleans lost $1.5 million in revenue, while the vessels involved in the collision sustained $1.5 million in damage. In Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. M/V Testbank, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard the consolidated claims of some forty-one lawsuits originally filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The claims in these suits stemmed from what the court held were pure economic losses in \\"shipping interests, marina and boat rental operators, wholesale and retail seafood enterprises not actually engaged in fishing, seafood restaurants, tackle and bait shops, and recreational fishermen\\". The court examined the holding in Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Flint, 275 U.S. 303 (1927). Testbank was chartered by the Bank Line and owned by the Partenreederei MS Charlotta.

Alibre is a brand of Alibre, LLC, a company based out of Texas.  About  Founded in 1997, Alibre began working closely with Microsoft in 1998 to develop the first web-based collaborative 3D design environment. The environment operated on a web-browser and allowed multiple users to work on the same design simultaneously. Following this development, Alibre received a patent for \\"System and method for solid modeling,\\" protecting their technologies for generating 3D geometries across a high bandwidth, distributed network. Alibre's purported aim in this development was to give businesses a cost-effective way to geographically distribute teams by enabling networked design environments without incurring large capital expenditures. Alibre Design is based on the ACIS modeling kernel from Spatial, and a 2D constraint system from Siemens PLM, among other technologies. It allows users to create modeled representations of concepts to facilitate design and manufacturing, with 2D and 3D functionality. Parametric solid modeling is driven by intelligent dimensions, meaning that the software automatically recomputes designs to accommodate changes to a single dimension, thereby maintaining the design's dimensional accuracy without necessitating manual adjustment of each dimension.  Products & Features  Alibre's products fall into two categories intended for different users and applications. Alibre Design Professional has a basic set of features intended for users to get started with CAD, whereas Alibre Design Expert is a 3D and 2D modeling application suitable or intended for professional use.  Design Tools  Some of Alibre's key design tools include: * Part modeling to define the geometry of individual components * Sheet metal modeling to define the geometry of individual components created from sheeted materials, such as sheet metal. Software adheres to the real-world constraints of sheeted goods * Assembly modeling to define relationships between individual components for final assembled designs. Software analyzes the relation of components to assess real-word constraints and conditions, such as tangency or alignment * Surface modeling to create organic surface models * 2D drafting to convert previously created 3D designs into 2D engineering drawings for manufacturing, patents and design communication  Technical Support & Training  Alibre includes free training through a built-in help section in the software. Free training is also available via online tutorials and videos. To get direct technical assistance for Alibre products, customers must buy a software maintenance plan, which gives access to support via telephone or online ticket system.

The state park offers picnicking, play fields, fishing and boating facilities, and is a stop on the East Bay Bike Path. History The site of Haines Memorial State Park was donated by the estate of Dr. George B. Haines (1843-1910), a doctor who practiced medicine in Valley Falls, in Cumberland, and was a public health officer there. Haines suffered from asthma, and was a proponent of the healthy benefits of fresh air. Haines purchased the Humphrey Farm in 1909, a \\"wooded retreat\\" of 83 acres, and lived there until his sudden death the following year. Haines' sister Ida then sold the property to the Rhode Island Metropolitan Park Commission for one dollar, in accordance with the doctor's wish that the land be used for \\"parks, parkway, or boulevard uses only.\\" Initially, the park featured picnic groves and ball fields, and was accessible by train or trolley from Bristol. The train tracks later became the East Bay Bicycle Path, which runs through the park. Between 1911 and 1915, the Park Commission increased the size of the park to 101.7 acres. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps sculpted the beach for the enhanced enjoyment of bathers, built fireplaces and a boat ramp, and created a pedestrian bridge that connected the park with Crescent Park until it was destroyed in the 1938 New England Hurricane. A bath house was added in 1940, and a seasonal farmers market began in 2002. Activities and amenities The park's boat ramp provides access to Bullock Cove, from which boaters can reach the lower Providence River and the headwaters of Narragansett Bay.

Kauakahiakua and KƒÅneikap≈çleikauila had a pi ªo son named Kapuaahiwalani (k). Her mother,  ªUmiaemoku, was one of three sisters that included Ikuaana and Umiulaikaahumanu, Kamehameha I's great grandmother and Queen Liliuokalani's fifth great grandmother. All three sisters were daughters of Mahiololi of Kohala. According to; \\"The Voyage of George Vancouver, 1791‚Äì1795: Volumes I‚ÄìIV\\", Vancouver records the following description of KƒÅnekap≈çlei; Vancouver writes of meeting her again in 1793. Guilt over memories of the ill fated Cook expedition had made Vancouver feel obligated to compensate with gifts as he writes; \\"I presented her with an assortment of valuables suitable to her former distinguished situation\\". Family Around 1762 KƒÅnekap≈çlei became one of the wives of Kalani ª≈çpu ªu, ali ªi nui of Hawaii island. She was not his highest ranking wife, that position was held by Kalola Pupuka-o-Honokawailani, the mother of his heir Kƒ´wala ª≈ç, but was considered his favorite. With Kalani ª≈çpu ªu, her sons included Ke≈çua K≈´ ªahu ªula and Ke≈çua Pe ªe ªale. Their first son would contend with Kamehameha I over the supremacy of the island of Hawaii until his death in 1790 at Kawaihae. Nothing is known about the fate of Ke≈çua Pe ªe ªale, although historian John F. G. Stokes argued Ke≈çua Pe ªe ªale was merely another name for Pauli Ka ª≈çleiok≈´. Kalani ª≈çpu ªu and Cook The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779, an unfinished painting by Johann Zoffany, circa 1795. During Captain Cook's third voyage of exploration in 1779, he mentioned King Kalani ª≈çpu ªu's favorite wife and queen, KƒÅnekap≈çlei. He and his men spelled her name many different ways including \\"Kanee-Kabareea\\", \\"Kanee- cappo-rei\\", \\"Kanee Kaberaia\\", \\"Kainee Kabareea\\", and \\"Kahna-Kubbarah\\". Cook's second-in-command, Lieutenant James King, recounted her role in preventing the kidnapping of her husband and their two sons: > \\"Things were in this prosperous train, the two boys being already in the > pinnace, and the rest of the party having advanced near the water-side, when > an elderly woman called Kanee-kabareea, the mother of the boys, and one of > the king's favourite wives, came after him, and with many tears, and > entreaties, besought him not to go on board\\". Hearing her calls, the Hawaiians gathered around the shore of Kealakekua Bay and tried to prevent their monarch from being taken. Cook's men had to retreat to the beach. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on his face in the surf. Ke≈çua K≈´ ªahu ªula According to Abraham Fornander, Ke≈çua K≈´ ªahu ªula was to blame for the initial breakout of civil war in Hawaii after the death of his father Kalani ª≈çpu ªu. He had received no lands due to his uncle Keawemauhili's claim as next in line to Kƒ´wala ª≈ç. Upset from the lack of any inheritance, he gathered his warriors, retainers and kahu and prepared for full battle, including their mahiole and  ªahu  ªula. They headed towards Ke‚Äòei where a fight broke out among the warriors and bathers of at the beach. Ke≈çua ends up killing a number of Kamehameha's men. Ka ª≈çleiok≈´ KƒÅnekap≈çlei had a son named Pauli Ka ª≈çleiok≈´. The figure's paternity has been sourced to both Kalani ª≈çpu ªu and Kamehameha I. Historians Abraham Fornander, Sheldon Dibble, and Samuel Kamakau all state Kamehameha I was Pauli's father however, sources earlier than Dibble deny this allegation and claims paternity to Kalani ª≈çpu ªu. Further research has brought his paternity into question. Both Konia, his grandmother and KƒÅnekap≈çlei herself, have flatly denied that Ka ª≈çleiok≈´ was a son of Kamehameha I. Ka ª≈çleiok≈´ was raised by his mother. He joined his brother Ke≈çua K≈´ ªahu ªula's forces in opposition to Kamehameha in 1782 after the Battle of Moku ª≈çhai split the island into three warring chiefdoms. In his book; \\"Pauahi: the Kamehameha legacy \\", George H. Kanahele states that Bernice Pauahi Bishop's mele hƒÅnau does not actually mention Kamehameha I. He attributes the suggestion of Ka ª≈çleiok≈´ being a son of Kamehameha to Joseph Moku ª≈çhai Poepoe who calles Pauli; \\"ke keiki kamaha ªo\\" (\\"the love child\\"). Kanahele also states that Mary Kawena P≈´ku ªi described this as part of the training of each warrior, and supposedly KƒÅnekap≈çlei was chosen for this training. The author points out that the incident that created the doubt was when Ke≈çua K≈´ ªahu ªula was killed at the consecration of the Pu ªukoholƒÅ Heiau and Kamehameha announced that Ka ª≈çleiok≈´ was the child of his beardless youth thus sparing his life. However in his note on that claim, Kanahele refers to Stokes as a counter; \\"For those who claim that Kamehameha did not father Ka ª≈çleiok≈´, the case is advanced by John F. B. Stokes in \\"Kaoleioku, Paternity and Biographical Sketch,\\". Her descendants by this son include Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani and Bernice Pauahi Bishop, founder of the Kamehameha School. Elizabeth Kekaaniauokalani Kalaninuiohilaukapu Pratt claims that Kamehameha I stopped the death by calling Ka ª≈çleiok≈´ his \\"keiki\\", meaning anything from his son to a nephew or even the son of a friend. Pratt states that Kamehameha's authority saved the boy and also brought him into the House of Kamehameha. Associated children KƒÅnekap≈çlei was also said to be the mother of Keli ªikahekili, one of the wives of Kame ªeiamoku and mother of Hoapili, although the father is not mentioned. Another figure often associated with KƒÅnekap≈çlei is Kahiwa or Regina KƒÅnekap≈çlei who was the mother of Kipikane, the wife of John Palmer Parker. Her father was Kamehameha I however, according to Edith McKinzie, her mother was Kauhilanimaka (w).

A platform gap is the space between a train car (or other mass transit vehicle) and the edge of the station platform, often created by geometric constraints, historic legacies, or use of partially compatible equipment.The Engineering Handbook of Smart Technology for Aging, Disability and Independence, Page 563 Many high-quality bus rapid transit (BRT) systems also use high platforms at station stops to allow fast and efficient level boarding and alighting, but potentially leaving hazardous gaps between the platforms and the buses. Alignment setups such as Kassel curbs help to reduce platform gaps without requiring time-consuming manual alignment at each BRT station stop. Straight platforms The ideal platform would be straight and align perfectly with a train or other large vehicle. Even in this case, a small gap between the conveyances and the platform is necessary to allow the vehicles to move freely without rubbing against the platform edge. In 2007, the Long Island Rail Road regarded an platform gap as typical on its non-curved platforms. Curved platforms University Station on the MTR system in Hong Kong In real-world situations, stations are often constrained by limited space, legacy designs, and track geometry or roadway layout. Stations may have to use a compromise design, with a platform curved in a way that will allow a vehicle or train to arrive and depart without mechanical interference, but which leaves unavoidable horizontal and possibly vertical gaps between the cars and the platform edge. These spaces are caused by the geometric gap between a curve (circular arc or otherwise) and the straight-line chord or tangent formed by a railcar or bus in proximity to a platform. These types of gaps are geometrically intrinsic, and cannot be eliminated as long as the platform is located on a curved or banked segment of track or guideway. When passenger car doors are located only at the ends of each car (a common design for commuter rail and long-distance trains), platform access from a concave platform is preferred, since this brings the car ends in closest proximity to the platform edge. By contrast, a convex platform would leave the largest possible gaps between the car ends and the platform edge, making this design undesirable and thus rarely implemented. An example of platforms designed for access from the concave side is at Lansdowne station in Boston, where side platforms for both the inbound and outbound directions are located to reduce platform gaps to commuter rail trains of the Framingham/Worcester Line. Concave and convex gaps also exist in several MTR stations in Hong Kong, particularly on the East Rail Line, which was built on the historic Kowloon-Canton Railway line. Gap fillers This German train has door-mounted gap fillers Mechanical platform edge extensions known as platform gap fillers may be used to bridge the gap between platform and vehicle. These stopgaps require careful alignment of the vehicle upon arrival, and careful synchronization to avoid serious damage caused by departure of the vehicle before the extenders are fully retracted. They increase station dwell time, and introduce safety and maintenance concerns of their own. Alternatively, the gap fillers may be mounted on the train, and linked to the door operating mechanism. They may be found on modern trainsets, like various versions of the Stadler GTW. Train-mounted gap fillers eliminate the need for careful alignment and, as the driver only gets the signal that the doors have closed when the fillers have fully retracted, require no special synchronization on departure. Moving all active components of the system to the train instead of the platform allows maintenance to be performed in a shop, rather than in the field. Singapore has committed to specifying its newer trains with gap fillers, to reduce the incidence of platform gap accidents in its crowded stations. Equipment compatibility In some rail systems, significant platform gaps may also occur (both horizontally and vertically) because of equipment and platforms designed to different and somewhat incompatible height and width standards. This situation may occur especially when previously separate rail systems are consolidated, or start to interoperate, thus allowing equipment to be moved onto tracks where it had not been used before. In 2007, public testimony by the acting president of the Long Island Rail Road cited the need to interoperate with freight service and other passenger services such as New Jersey Transit and Amtrak, in addition to its own diverse rolling stock, as complicating and slowing efforts to deal with platform gap hazards. Other contributing factors Other variables that can increase platform gaps include rail wear, wheel wear, condition of the railcar suspension, and passenger load. A further complication is super- elevation, deliberate tilting of the railbed to allow faster travel around curves. This factor is especially relevant on systems where some express trains (such as long-distance Amtrak trains) operate non-stop through local stations located on curves. Higher pass-through speeds also increase railcar sway, requiring even larger physical clearances to avoid platform strikes. Specifications and limits 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square requires gap fillers at regular intervals In the US, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires that platforms be ‚Äúreadily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs (49 CFR Part 37, Appendix A, 10.3.1 (9))‚Äù. However, this rule only applies to new construction or major renovations of stations. A 2009 report to the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) observes that ADA rules specify that \\"At stations with high level platforms, there may be a gap of no more than 3‚Äù horizontal and 5/8‚Äù vertical between platform edge and entrance to the rail car. However, currently no passenger rail system in the U.S. has been able to achieve this without the use of manually operated 'bridge plates'.‚Äù , the US Federal Railway Administration recommended platform gap maximum limits of , and on curves. Mitigation Physical measures to reduce platform gaps may include realigning trackbeds, realigning platform slabs, and extending platform edges with wooden boards. Operational measures may include \\"zoning off\\" some railcars (not opening certain doors at problematic stations), relocating where trains stop along a lengthy platform, and temporarily deploying \\"platform conductor\\" personnel to assist passengers. On systems where the floor level of the vehicle and the platform height closely match, an extendible step can be installed below the doors of the vehicle that deploy when the doors are unlocked. This significantly decreases the gap and thus the risks, while at the most vulnerable situation, boarding and alighting of vehicles at stations or stops. This method is used by the German BR423 EMU's and its derivatives, including the Dutch variant SLT. A public awareness campaign may be used, employing visually distinct platform edge markings, posters, signs, public safety announcements, and web videos to increase safety awareness. The MTA Long Island Rail Road website lists some precautions passengers should observe regarding platform gaps. An article in The Guardian conceded that some passengers who have fallen into platform gaps were drunk at the time, but pointed out other incidents when victims did not suffer that impairment. The writer complained specifically about gaps that measured from which posed safety threats to children and the elderly, and called for modification of dangerous platforms. Incidents and accidents An incident involved Robert Todd Lincoln (son of American president Abraham Lincoln) and a platform gap in Jersey City, New Jersey during the American Civil War. While waiting on a crowded train platform, Robert Lincoln was pushed against the train, and the train started to move, dropping his feet into the gap. He was saved from possible serious injury or death by the prompt actions of well-known actor Edwin Booth (the brother of John Wilkes Booth, who a few months later would assassinate President Lincoln).Edwin Booth Saved Robert Todd Lincoln‚Äôs Life. History Net. Retrieved on 2011-08-06. A 2009 American report identified platform gap injury risk factors, including \\"mobility, being elderly, having disabilities (visual impairment), being accompanied by small children or incidents occurring to small children, behavior of other passengers such as pushing or jostling, carry luggage and other articles, alcohol, degraded platform conditions such as crowding, wet platforms or uneven platforms, and stepping distances\\". In 2014, a news service in Mumbai, India reported several serious platform gap mutilation incidents and a death within a few months, mostly attributed to crowded conditions. In 2015, Singapore had at least two platform gap incidents which were eventually resolved, but caused significant disruptions in rush-hour service.  Gap too small  An accident occurred when a man fell between the platform and the train, and could not release his foot because the gap was too small.

He is best known as the bassist and founder of the Asian American dance-rock band, The Slants, who won their case against the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office at the United States Supreme Court. The case, Matal v. Tam, was a landmark legal battle that clarified First Amendment rights in trademark law. The court ruled unanimously in Tam's favor, holding that trademark registrations may not be rejected under the Disparagement Clause of the Lanham Act (1946) since that would be considered viewpoint discrimination; this includes, as in Tam's case, trademarks using such language filed by members of minority groups who wish to reclaim slurs that would have been previously denied.  Early life and career  Tam was born and raised in San Diego, California. At age 13, he started his first record label, SBG Records. He attended Grossmont College, Mt. San Jacinto College, and University of California, Riverside, where he double-majored in philosophy and religious studies. During this time, he started a record label (SBG Records), music promotion company, and was the co-owner of a vintage clothing shop in Temecula, CA. A few months before graduating, Tam dropped out of college to join The Stivs, a punk band based in Portland, Oregon. While with the band, he worked on releases \\"T.B.I.L Revisited\\" and \\"Sweet Heartache and the Satisfaction.\\" The band made a short appearance on The Price Is Right, and Bob Barker lent his voice as an introduction to their album. In 2004, Tam left The Stivs to form an all-Asian American members rock band. This eventually became The Slants. During most of his time in Portland, Tam worked for nonprofit organizations as a marketing director and served on the board of numerous social justice organizations. He also finished his college education and graduated with a Master in Business Administration from Marylhurst University in 2013, receiving the Distinguished Alum Award, and began publishing his writing. During this time, he co-founded the Oregon Center for Human Rights, partnered with his sister to open a restaurant, and established several other businesses. A profile in Forbes states that \\"His secret is applying the skills he builds in each area to the others...His LinkedIn profile is a paragon of completeness.\\" In 2017, he moved to Nashville, TN. The Slants and the Supreme Court case, Matal v. Tam In 2006, Tam launched The Slants. He says the band's name was chosen \\"as a way of seizing control of a racial slur, turning it on its head and draining its venom. It was also a respectful nod to Asian-Americans who had been using the epithet for decades.\\". In late 2009, Tam's attorney recommended that he file an application to register the band's trademark. This eventually became an extensive legal battle when the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) ruled that the band's name was disparaging to persons of Asian descent. The USPTO relied on UrbanDictionary.com to support its claim. Initially, Tam provided extensive evidence to appeal the USPTO decision, including testimonies from leading dictionary experts, national surveys, and letters from Asian American community leaders, but the Trademark Office remained steadfast in their refusal. In 2011, Tam filed a second application that focused on procedural and evidentiary issues in its appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit initially ruled against him but issued a Motion to vacate Sua sponte (own its own accord). They invited Tam to be arguing the constitutional merits of the law being used against him. In 2015, the court ruled in a 9-to-3 vote that the law used by the USPTO violated the First Amendment. In 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed and ruled unanimously in Tam's favor in Matal v. Tam. Tam has continued to remain active in First Amendment activism after the conclusion of his Supreme Court case. In 2019, he joined prominent hip-hop artists Killer Mike, Chance the Rapper, Meek Mill, and 21 Savage in filing an amicus brief in Jamal Knox v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He also filed a brief at the Supreme Court on behalf of Erik Brunetti in Iancu v. Brunetti, often known as the sister case to Matal v. Tam, which struck down the \\"scandalous\\" and \\"immoral\\" provisions of the Lanham Act. Additionally, he often speaks at legal and community events around the world on Matal v. Tam. In addition, he leads Continuing Learning Education (CLE) credit courses for attorneys and teaches on Matal v. Tam. He was honored with the First Amendment Award from the Hugh M. Hefner Foundation, the Mark T. Banner Award from the American Bar Association, and Milestone Case of the Year from Managing IP Magazine for his activism.  Media and public appearances  In 2010, Tam started a music industry blog on his music company's website, Last Stop Booking (formerly Populuxe Entertainment). Soon after, became a frequent contributor for Music Think Tank, ASCAP, and had a regular column on the Huffington Post. Eventually, he published two books on the music industry, How to Get Sponsorships and Endorsements and Music Business Hacks. In late 2011, Tam began writing on racism and the Asian American experience for sites like CHANGELAB's Race Files and YOMYOMF. In 2012, his essay, \\"A Slanted View,\\" was published in Where Are You From? An Anthology of Asian American Writing. Shortly after, he published numerous op-ed pieces on his trademark case, Matal v. Tam, for newspapers such as the New York Times and The Oregonian. He also began writing short pieces for feminist publication Bitch Media. In 2015, Tam's essay, Trademark Offense was published in Oregon Humanities magazine. It was later listed as an honorable mention in America's Best Essays 2016. In 2019, Tam published his memoir, Slanted: How an Asian American Troublemaker Took on the Supreme Court. The memoir covers multiple aspects of his life as an artist-activist, including growing up as a child of immigrant restaurant owners, falling in love with punk rock, and the journey to the U.S Supreme Court. As a speaker, Tam often delivers keynotes and workshops for Fortune 500 companies as well as higher education organizations, with a focus on entrepreneurship, marketing, technology, and diversity and inclusion. He has made 13 TEDx appearances as a speaker and performer. In 2016, Tam joined President Barack Obama, George Takei, Jeremy Lin, and other celebrities in the #ActToChange campaign to fight bullying. Tam hosts the podcast show Music Business Hacks. In addition, he is a regular contributor for Billboard, Music Think Tank, ASCAP, and Huffington Post.

It intended to \\"make renting a (general aviation) plane as easy as renting a car.\\" The company ceased operations on 23 December 2019. History OpenAirplane was founded in 2012 as a web-based service to make access to rental aircraft easier. Pilots in the United States usually need a flight review (also called a \\"checkout\\") with a certified flight instructor at each aircraft rental company or fixed-base operator (FBO) that they wish to rent from, regardless of recent flight experience. This checkout can take several hours and the pilot must pay for both the rental of the airplane as well as the wage of the flight instructor. OpenAirplane requires member pilots to complete a standardized checkout procedure called a \\"Universal Pilot Checkout (UPC)\\" in a particular make and model of aircraft at an OpenAirplane member FBO. Once successfully completed, the UPC allows a pilot to fly the same make/model aircraft at any other member FBO without additional checkrides or experience reviews. The checkout procedure is based on the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) procedure and pilots holding the relevant CAP approval do not need to carry out a further checkout. The company was endorsed by Starr Aviation, a member of Starr International Company (insurance), and the Cessna Aircraft Company. OpenAirplane launched on June 17, 2013 with operators in six US locations: Chicago, Long Island, Kissimmee, Troy, Long Beach, and San Jose. As of Sep 2014, OpenAirplane had grown to over 71 locations. At Sun 'n Fun 2014, OpenAirplane announced the expansion of their program to allow privately owned aircraft to be rented through OpenAirplane. Insurance carrier Starr Aviation created a new kind of insurance policy that offered coverage for aircraft owners who wanted to make their aircraft available to pilots using OpenAirplane. The new policy is claimed to only be a modest increase in cost compared to group rental coverage that typically costs four- or eight-times as much as a personal aircraft policy. In Oct 2014, OpenAirplane and Cirrus Aircraft Corporation announced a collaboration where pilots who complete Cirrus factory training are able to rent the same model Cirrus aircraft in the OpenAirplane network without needing an OpenAirplane checkout. The privilege is valid for six months, after which the pilot will need to complete a normal OpenAirplane UPC. The company shutdown on 23 December 2019. Founder Rod Rakic blamed the company's failure on lack of market interest. He stated \\"while the idea of OpenAirplane won us praise, fans, and even super fans, the reality is that too few pilots took to the skies to make the operation sustainable. If there‚Äôs one thing that we learned the hard way, it is that it‚Äôs tough to get pilots off the couch and into the cockpit.\\"  References   External links  * * Official website archives on Archive.org * AVweb interview with Rod Rakic, the co-founder of OpenAirplane Category:General aviation Category:Aviation websites ","title":"OpenAirplane"},{"id":"37921875","text":"Charmian (, also Romanized as Charmƒ´ƒÅn and CharmeyƒÅn) is a village in Mosaferabad Rural District, Rudkhaneh District, Rudan County, Hormozgan Province, Iran.

It originally aired on NBC on March 14, 2013. The episode guest stars Majandra Delfino, Matt Jones, Thomas Middleditch, Blake Garrett Rosenthal, David Koechner, Allan Havey, Nora Kirkpatrick, Mary Gillis, and Michael Schur. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The episode revolves around Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) attending the funeral of his Aunt Shirley at Schrute Farms, where his family reunites. Meanwhile, Todd Packer (David Koechner) returns to the office claiming to be a reformed man. \\"The Farm\\" was produced to serve as a backdoor pilot for a proposed spin-off series starring Wilson as Dwight, which NBC ultimately did not pick up. The episode received mostly negative reviews from television critics, with many criticizing Dwight's farm storyline and some critics calling it a \\"Frankenstein episode\\". The episode was viewed by 3.54 million viewers and received a 1.9/5 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest- rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) informs the office that his Aunt Shirley has died. He proceeds to either invite his co-workers to his funeral or stay away via the bizarre Schrute custom of throwing certain dirt in their faces, only inviting Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) out of spite after Oscar was secretly relieved that he wasn't going to be invited. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose (Michael Schur) and Zeke (Matt Jones), his brother Jeb (Thomas Middleditch), his sister Fannie (Majandra Delfino) and his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal). When the service starts, Oscar flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure it is really dead. The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate on the condition that they all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in due to the lack of sophistication farm life offers, but agree to stay for a couple of days. Dwight also bonds with Cammy, courts local farmer Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), and later surveys the farm with his siblings. Todd Packer (David Koechner) visits the office and announces that he wants to make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but the remaining employees eat their cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs in retaliation for his firing. The next morning, Pam returns to the office and announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed. Packer visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them. Production Majandra Delfino guest starred as Dwight's sister. The episode was written and directed by executive producer and former showrunner Paul Lieberstein, marking his thirteenth writing credit, sixth directorial credit and fourth dual credit. \\"The Farm\\" was the fifth episode produced, but was the seventeenth aired, as noted by its production number. It was originally supposed to act as a backdoor pilot for a spin-off series, also called The Farm starring Wilson and focusing on Dwight. As such, Wilson was initially slated to appear in only 13 episodes of The Offices ninth season before leaving for the spin-off. Paul Lieberstein, the showrunner for The Office for seasons five through eight, stepped down at the start of season nine in order to focus more energy on the potential spin-off. However, upon review, the spin-off was not picked up by NBC. Executive producer Greg Daniels revealed that the episode would have additional material shot so that it fits better into the season, as the original version contained \\"certain aspects that were appropriate for a pilot of a new show\\". The episode guest stars Majandra Delfino, Blake Garrett Rosenthal, Thomas Middleditch and Matt Jones as members of Dwight's family, who were intended to form the main cast of The Farm with Wilson; Delfino plays Dwight's sister Fannie, Rosenthal plays Dwight's nephew Cammy, Middleditch portrays Dwight's brother Jeb, and Jones portrays Dwight's cousin Zeke. Tom Bower appears as Dwight's great uncle Heinrich in a deleted scene only, although he retains his credit in the broadcast episode. Jones had previously appeared in the ninth season entry, \\"Junior Salesman\\". Broadcast and reception Ratings \\"The Farm\\" originally aired on NBC on March 14, 2013, after a four-week hiatus. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by an estimated 3.54 million viewers and received a 1.9 rating/5 percent share. This means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a decrease in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Moving On\\". The Office ranked fourth in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the CBS police procedural Person of Interest which received a 2.9/8 percent rating, an entry of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which received a 2.6/7 percent rating, and an installment of the Fox series Glee which received a 2.0/6 percent rating. Despite this, the episode was the highest-rated NBC series for the night. 1.90 million viewers watched the episode via DVR playback, bringing the total viewership to 5.36 million viewers and a 3.0 18‚Äì49 rating.Bibel, Sara (April 1, 2013). \\"Live+7 DVR Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' Leads Adults 18‚Äì49 Ratings & Total Viewership Gains; '90210' Earns Biggest Percentage Increase in Week 25\\".

Reviews \\"The Farm\\" received mostly negative reviews from critics, many criticizing Dwight's farm storyline and some critics calling it a \\"Frankenstein episode\\". M. Giant of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a C. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix considered NBC's decision not to pick up the spin-off for more episodes the right decision, writing that the characters and scenes were \\"barely sketches\\" and featured too much \\"cartoonishness\\". Sepinwall also criticized the Todd Packer scenes, and only saw Dwight's interactions with his nephew, Cammy, in a positive light. TV.com columnist Nick Campbell called the farm storyline \\"unnatural\\" compared to the episode and the series, as a whole, and wrote that the tone to the ending \\"didn't match\\". Despite this, he complimented the storyline for \\"establishing tone, characters, and direction in literally half the time usually allotted\\". The A.V. Club reviewer Erik Adams complimented the episode for serving as a \\"breather\\" from the season's long arcs, and gave good background information into Dwight's personality. He went on to criticize the pilot's broad humor, writing that following the scene featuring Dwight shooting a shotgun into his aunt's casket, \\"it would be next to impossible for The Farm to heighten from that point\\". Adams graded the episode a B. Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the two storylines \\"two pieces of that didn't work all that well together\\", which all added to a \\"dull\\" episode. Houx complimented Koechner's performance, calling him a \\"great improviser\\" but wrote that the whole plot was lacking. He also considered the farm plotline to be pointless and aimless, especially due to it airing in the last few episodes of the series.

The episode was written by Niki Schwartz-Wright and directed by Rodman Flender. It originally aired on NBC on January 10, 2013. The episode guest stars Julius \\"Dr. J\\" Erving as himself. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) accidentally brings lice into the office but lets Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) take the fall, while Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) vows to destroy the parasites. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) spends a great day in Philadelphia with a potential business associate (Erving); Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) interfere with Darryl Philbin's (Craig Robinson) love life. \\"Lice\\" received mixed reviews from television critics; many reviewers enjoyed the emphasis the episode placed on Flannery's character, although others felt the story did not work. The episode was also viewed by 4.54 million viewers and received a 2.2/6 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking third in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) finds managing her household without her husband Jim (John Krasinski) to be more difficult than anticipated, as she struggles with duties such as taking out the trash. Her already frazzled condition worsens when she finds lice on her daughter Cece, leaving her no choice but to wash all the clothing in the house. At work the next day, she notices Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) frantically scratching her head, and realizes she may have transferred the lice from Cece to the office. She initiates an investigation and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who experienced numerous lice infestations as a child in foster care, finds that all of the employees except Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) have lice. Given her disregard for cleanliness, the employees assume Meredith is responsible; Pam defends her but neglects to admit her guilt. To eliminate the lice, Meredith shaves her head. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) also overreacts, donning a hazmat suit and accidentally exposing himself to a hallucinogenic bug bomb that causes him to faint. On Erin's advice, the other infected employees pair up to put mayonnaise on each other's hair to suffocate the lice, which allows Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin to spend time together and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to prank Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) in retaliation for his affair with her husband. Pam's mother calls to inform her that Cece still has lice; the other staff overhear and realize Pam is responsible for the lice infestation, much to Meredith's delight. Jim goes to Philadelphia to meet with a potential investor in his sports marketing company; the investor is none other than Julius \\"Dr. J\\" Erving, a personal hero of Jim's. Being sensitive to how difficult it must be to manage the house and kids by herself, Jim does not tell her who the investor is during their phone conversations and pretends to be stressed over the meeting; Pam, in turn, affects to be having no problems so that she will not add to Jim's supposed stress. Back at the office, Pam apologizes to Meredith, and the two go out for a beer. While at the bar, Pam tells Meredith‚Äîwho is a single parent‚Äîshe now realizes how hard it is to handle children without a husband. The two bond throughout the night, singing a karaoke version of Girls Just Want to Have Fun. The uninfected workers are sent down to the warehouse to avoid contracting lice. Darryl had recently manipulated the warehouse foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan) into breaking up with him because he wanted to have a new start when he moves to Philadelphia for his job at Jim's new sports marketing company. Darryl tells the others about this and feigns heartbreak to gain their sympathy and appear that the breakup was not his choice. Nellie, Phyllis, and Kevin confront Val and try to convince her to take Darryl back, to no avail. However, when Kevin then ask out Val, she is so mortified at her apparent dating prospects that she decides to get back together with Darryl, much to his annoyance. Production The episode guest starred Julius Erving, who portrayed himself. \\"Lice\\" was written by story editor Niki Schwartz- Wright, marking her debut writing credit for the series. It was directed by Rodman Flender. This marked his second directorial effort for the series, after the earlier ninth season entry \\"The Whale\\". As mentioned before, the episode guest starred Erving as himself. In addition, \\"Lice\\" featured performances by Ameenah Kaplan, who reprised her role as Val; and Linda Purl as Pam's mother, whose voice was heard on the phone. This is the third episode to not feature Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) or Clark (Clark Duke). Helms left the show temporarily in the season's sixth episode \\"The Boat\\" in order to film The Hangover Part III, whereas Duke left for a few episodes to film Kick-Ass 2. Kate Flannery did not actually shave her head for the episode. According to her Twitter account, make-up artist Ed French was responsible for the bald cap and Kim M. Ferry designed the shaved hair effect. According to the actress, the prosthetics took three hours to apply. Afterwards, she joked that she has \\"newfound respect for the actors in Planet of the Apes!\\" The scenes at the end of the episode take place at The Bog; this is an actual bar in Scranton. In addition, the exterior shots were all actually filmed in Scranton. In order to secure permission, the series' production staff phoned the bar's co-owner, Brian Craig, and requested that the bar be featured on the show. Reportedly, parts of the scenes were filmed with an iPhone. Cultural references Jim compares spending a day with Julius Erving to a hypothetical situation wherein Pam would spend the day with John Stamos. Pam and Meredith bond over karaoke, and the two sing the song \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\", which was made famous by Cyndi Lauper in 1983. Broadcast and reception Ratings \\"Lice\\" originally aired on NBC on January 10, 2013. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by 4.54 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating/6 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The Office ranked third in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the CBS series Person of Interest which received a 2.9/8 percent rating, and an entry of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.2/8 percent rating. In addition, The Office was the highest-rated NBC television program on the night it aired. The episode was the twenty-fourth most-watched episode of television for the week it aired in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, with 2.772 million viewers in the age group. Reviews USA Today writer Whitney Matheson called the episode \\"the funniest ep this season\\" and that \\"it also ranks as one of the best since Steve Carell's departure in 2011\\". She lauded Flannery's performance, writing that \\"the actress has never made me laugh harder than on last night's episode\\". Mark Trammell of TV Equals called the episode \\"excellent\\"; he was particularly pleased with the episode's humor. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode four out of five stars and said that it allowed Meredith, who until the episode had been \\"a mostly one-dimensional source of promiscuity jokes\\" to have \\"two dimensions for once\\". He also applauded Fischer's performance, writing that it \\"would make for a terrific Emmy submission episode\\". Farihah Zaman of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B\\" and criticized its excessive narrative threads. She felt that Pam and Jim's separation brought \\"out the worst in them\\", but that \\"the same situations that force Jim and Pam to confront their flaws reveal the overlooked strengths of a couple of less prominent characters\\". She also wrote that the ending was \\"touching\\" because it humanized Meredith and made her out as a \\"badass\\". Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a score of 7.8 out of 10, denoting a \\"good\\" episode. She felt that the final scenes with Pam and Meredith singing were \\"a nice callback to the show's glory days\\" and made the ending feel \\"layered and grounded\\". White also applauded the short sequence that showed many of the office staff mundanely going about their day with mayonnaise on their heads, noting that the pacing was reminiscent of the first season when the episodes \\"had room to breathe\\". White, however, did feel that Jim's storyline was too reminiscent of the story arc in the fifth season when Pam went to art school. Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote an extremely negative review of the episode and called it \\"terrible\\". He felt that Pam's behavior due to Jim being gone was uncalled for. Furthermore, he felt that Dwight \\"swung too far into the territory that is known as 'annoying caricature. Campbell did, however, write highly of Ellie Kemper, saying that \\"she's played [her character] funnily and warmly as anyone else\\". Several reviewers argued that the episode functioned as a filler episode. Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called it the \\"epitome of filler\\". ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx wrote that \\"if everyone were in the same location this would be a bottle episode\\". Furthermore, Darryl's subplot was mostly criticized. Tedder wrote that while \\"it's fine to have a story line where someone pursues something and then realizes it wasn't what it was cracked up to be\\" he wished that the show had actually developed Val as a character. White wrote that she did not enjoy seeing \\"this manipulative version of Darryl\\" because it contrasted with his earlier characterization in episodes like \\"The Deposition\\". Zaman called the subplot \\"surprising\\".

After the war, he gave evidence against other participants in the program. Biography Hegener was born in Sensburg, East Prussia, in 1905. He trained as a banker, working for Dresdner Bank as an accountant. After losing his job because of the Depression, he founded a dye works, which, however, went bankrupt. He joined the Nazi party in 1931. In 1937, an acquaintance enabled him to find a job at the Reich Chancellery, and he was transferred to Hitler's Chancellery. Initially he worked as a clerk sorting mail addressed to Hitler and processing applications from part-Jews, so-called Mischlinge, who wished to marry. By 1939, the year Hitler gave permission for the program to \\"euthanize\\" handicapped children, he had become deputy to Hans Hefelmann and office manager in Department IIb, which processed ministerial matters and requests for clemency. With the beginning of the \\"child euthanasia\\" program, the first stage in the program that would become known after World War II as Action T4, several front organizations were founded to conceal the involvement of Hitler's chancellery and of the Department of the Interior. One of these was a Reichsausschuss zur wissenschaftlichen Erfassung von erb- und anlagebedingten schweren Leiden (Reich Committee for Research on Hereditary and Constitutional Susceptibility to Severe Diseases), which was a front for Hans Hefelmann and Department IIb. To transport people to be killed according to the program, the Gemeinn√ºtzige Krankentransport GmbH (General Patients' Transport Corporation, known as Gekrat) was organized, headed by Reinhold Vorberg of Department IIc. Hegener was responsible for logistics and obtained Post Office buses for Gekrat; as a result, Gekrat was internally referred to as \\"Hegener's Special Group\\".Court statements by von Hegener on June 23, 1961 and September 2, 1965, cited in Hegener later provided an account of how the method of killing was decided: injections and overdoses of narcotics were ruled out as impractical and it was decided to use carbon monoxide gas, filling a room at a suitably located clinic with the gas in order to terminate a large group at a time. This was the origin of the gas chambers.Statement cited at Euthanasie, Deathcamps.org, 2 September 2006, retrieved December 14, 2012 Hegener was present at a test of the methodology that took place in January 1940 at the old jail in Brandenburg an der Havel (later Brandenburg Euthanasia Center) and was subsequently responsible for obtaining the necessary materials for constructing the gas chambers and cremation facilities at the \\"euthanasia centers\\", as well as for the delivery of the gas. He ordered what was needed both for the child killing program and for the adults, including the large amounts of drugs such as phenobarbital used in the latter program. In addition, he and Hefelmann processed the forms that doctors and midwives were required to submit in case of an abnormal birth and determined which newborns were ineligible to be killed under the program.. He later worked with Viktor Brack on the adult \\"euthanasia\\" program. and, after Hitler ordered it stopped in 1941, they both provided their expertise in starting up the program to gas the Jews in the concentration camps. At the end of the war, Hegener took refuge together with Hefelmann in Stadtroda, in Thuringia, where the records concerning the child \\"euthanasia\\" program were also taken to be destroyed. He worked first in agriculture and later for a timber processing company. Under the slightly altered name of Richard Wegener, he obtained a position at the Ministry of Commerce and Transportation in Mecklenburg. Discovered in 1949, Hegener was sentenced on 14 July 1952 by the Magdeburg State Court to life in prison for crimes against humanity. However, after serving four years of his sentence, he was released in July 1956 under a so- called ministerial decision. He then moved from East Germany to the West. He remained in contact with his former supervisor, Hefelmann, and obtained a sales position at Deutsche Werft in Hamburg through Dietrich Allers, who was advising the company legally and had formerly headed the central office at Action T4. Hegener was interrogated beginning in 1960, and gave evidence at the trials of Franz Hofer, the former Gauleiter of Tyrol-Vorarlberg, in the early 1960s, of Hefelmann in 1964,(payment required) and of Allers in 1968. He died in Altona, Hamburg, in 1981.

Brown then studied at Wheaton College in Illinois, where he was also a basketball player and coach (1904 and 1905 seasons), but could not complete his course due to financial constraints. He next served as coach of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign basketball team for the 1905‚Äì06 season, then was hired as Chicago YMCA Physical Director in 1906. In 1907 he became Physical Director of the Salt Lake City YMCA, serving until the start of 1910. * Offered the job of Physical Director of the Manila YMCA, Brown moved to the US Philippine Islands in January 1910 and immediately introduced basketball and volleyball. (Since then, the Philippines has become a regional power in men's basketball.) * In the summers of 1910 and 1911 (mid-February to late May), by request of Governor-General William Cameron Forbes, Brown set up a sports program for Filipino insular government employees at the summer capital of Baguio, a hugely successful project that favorably impressed the Governor. After he was appointed Chairman of the Playground Commission by Gov. Forbes, Brown set up a network of public playgrounds in Manila. * In November 1910 Brown proposed the establishment of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF) which was founded in January 1911 with Gov. Forbes as President and Brown as the Secretary. Simultaneously, various sports bodies for individual sports were organised under the PAAF umbrella. The PAAF was recognized in 1929 by the International Olympic Committee as the Philippine Olympic authority, and later changed its name to Philippine Olympic Committee in 1975.Buchanan, 1998.Brown, Elwood, \\"Annual Report,\\" 1 Oct 1912‚Äì1 Oct 1913, YMCAA. * In 1911 Brown became Director of Athletics at the famous Manila Carnival. The Carnival was an exposition and festival showcasing American and Philippine culture, commerce, industry, politics, military, and tourism, would last from 1908 to 1939, and would be copied by other cities and towns across the islands. Brown used the Carnival to promote sports in Asia. In the same year, the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation invited foreign participation at the Manila Carnival games. * In September 1912, Brown proposed the organization of a \\"Far Eastern Olympic Games\\" during the 1913 Manila Carnival, that resulted in the formation of the Far Eastern Olympic Association, with Gov. Forbes as President and Brown as Secretary-General (1912‚ÄìJanuary 1918), and the holding of the Far Eastern Olympic Games, January‚ÄìFebruary 1913. (In 1915, the names were changed to Far Eastern Athletic Association and Far Eastern Championship Games.

At the 1920 meeting in Antwerp, Belgium, Brown broached the idea of holding a \\"Hindu Games\\" in India. Involvement in Scouting * As the physical director of the Manila YMCA, Elwood Brown also became the Philippines' first Scoutmaster, organizing the very first Boy Scout troops in 1910.The Boy Scouts of America magazine Boys' Life, Vol. LX, No. 8, August 1970, page 36, reports: \\"It was also the Americans who brought the Boy Scout movement to the Philippines in the same year ‚Äì 1910 ‚Äì that the Boy Scouts of America came into existence.\\"While the Scout Association of Japan recognizes Clarence Griffin (1873‚Äì1951) as Japan's first Scoutmaster and his 1st Yokohama Troop as Japan's first recognized Scout unit, no such richly deserved recognition is given to Elwood Stanley Brown and his three YMCA troops by the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. Not surprisingly, Brown then involved the Boy Scouts in social service in the Manila Carnival. (Arguably, a part of his Scouting legacy is the Boy Scouts of the Philippines which was inaugurated in 1938 and has since become one of the largest Scout associations in the world.) * Brown wrote to Boy Scouts of America Honorary President Theodore Roosevelt about the Manila Boy Scouts serving at the 1910 Manila Carnival and the \\"Great Fire in Manila. Brown's letter was extensively quoted in Roosevelt's letter, dated July 1911, to BSA Executive Secretary James Edward West. The BSA published the entire text of Roosevelt's letter in the 1911 first edition of the Official Handbook for Boys. (See at Gutenberg.) * Portions of Roosevelt's quote of Brown's letter have been reprinted (before and after the publication of the Official Handbook for Boys) in New Castle News (26 May 1911), the Corsicana Daily Sun (31 May 1911), Boys' Life (Vol. I, No. 5, July 1911, page 33), The Washington Post (8 August 1911), The Youngstown Daily Vindicator (23 August 1911), The Miami Metropolis (20 September 1911, page 3), and the BSP book On My Honor (2001). The Boys' Life bit, \\"Philippine Boy Scouts,\\" reports: \\"Proof of the value of the Boy Scouts comes from Manila, Philippine Islands, the outpost of the Boy Scout movement. Elwood E. Brown who has organized the Boy Scouts in the Philippines, has written a letter to the national headquarters of the Boy Scouts of America, telling of the assistance which the Manila Boy Scouts gave recently at a fire in Manila.\\" The Miami Metropolis article \\"Boy Scouts Work with the Firemen Just Like Heroes\\", reported that it was \\"Elwood E.

Mummert.See Early History of Scouting in the Philippines * During his world tour, Boy Scouts Founder, Sir Robert Stephenson Baden-Powell, sent back to London articles for publication in the British Scouting periodical The Scout. In issue no. 224, 27 July 1912, in the article \\"In the Cannibal Islands,\\" Baden-Powell made a brief narration about his trip to Manila. He mentioned \\"Boy Scouts of the Philippines\\" and that he had been met by a \\"Guard of Honour.\\" He quoted Brown's and Roosevelt's letters about the Manila fire and the Manila Carnival in which Manila Scouts rendered service. In the article, Baden-Powell urged his young British readers \\"to get into correspondence with your brother Scouts in Manila‚Ä¶ The Chief Scoutmaster is Mr. Elwood Brown, Y.M.C.A., Manila.\\" Later life Brown died of complications from a heart attack on March 24, 1924, three weeks short of his 41st birthday.

From mid-June to early August 1895, Vivekananda conducted a series of private lectures to a groups of selected disciples at the Thousand Island Park. a number of lectures were recorded by Sara Ellen Waldo and she then published those as a book.  Background   Parliament of World's Religions  Vivekananda represented India at the Parliament of World's Religions in Chicago in 1893 and there his lectures received overwhelming success and he himself found a lot of attention from the people of United States. After the closing of the Parliament, Vivekananda started to conduct public lectures. He went to Detroit in 1894, where he conducted a series of public lectures. There Sister Christine and Mary Funke heard him for the first time. After finishing the lecture series in Detroit, he went to New York and lectured in few other cities.  Lectures at Brooklyn  Swami Vivekananda at Thousand Island Park in July 1895. In December 1894 Vivekananda, Vivekananda delivered a lecture before the Brooklyn Ethical Association. The topic of the lecture was Hinduism. After the lecture the interest of listeners grew so deep that they demanded regular classes in Brooklyn. At this time Vivekananda took several public classes at Pouch Mansion and elsewhere.  Classes at New York  After finishing the Brooklyn lecture session, Vivekananda moved to New York. But, few of his disciples started going to the place at New York where Vivekananda stayed at that time. So, Vivekananda had to start classes there too. It was a small room of a lodging house where he was staying at that time and the number of students and disciples increased so rapidly that it soon went beyond of the small room's capacity of the chairs. But, his students still used to sit on the floor, dresser etc. to hear his words. Attending these lectures were entirely free and the needed expenses were attempted to be collected by voluntary donation. But later it was seen the amount they were getting through voluntary donations was insufficient to pay the rent of the house and other maintenances. So, the classes started facing financial problems. At this time Vivekananda decided to conduct another series of public lectures to collect money to run private classes. He explained, according to Hindu tradition, students should not be charged, and a teacher has to bear expenses of his works.  Private classes at Thousand Island Park  The interest of the students of Vivekananda grew so much that they requested Vivekananda to continue the classes through the summer too. At this time Vivekananda was very tired after multiple long sessions of lectures. However, upon the request, he decided to continue the classes. A problem arose at that time when it was found too many of his students would be out of town at that time and they had to arrange a place to conduct the classes. The problem was solved when Miss D, one of the students, came forward and told she owned a cottage at Thousand Island Park and offered it to use the cottage. Vivekananda and his disciples accepted the offer. From mid-June to early August 1895 Vivekananda conducted classes and delivered lectures to some selected students at Thousand Island Park. Publication  A number of lectures of Vivekananda were taken down by Sara Ellen Waldo, a disciple of Vivekananda (who was later known as Haridasi). According to Swami Ramakrishnananda‚Äî \\"To mother Haridasi (Miss S. Ellen Waldo) the whole world should be grateful for these \\"inspired\\" talks of Swamiji..\\" The book was first published in 1909 by The Ramakrishna Mission, Madras.

It was directed by David France, a journalist who covered AIDS from its beginnings. France's first film, it was dedicated to his partner Doug Gould who died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 1992. The documentary was produced using more than 700 hours of archived footage which included news coverage, interviews as well as film of demonstrations, meetings and conferences taken by ACT UP members themselves. France says they knew what they were doing was historic, and that many of them would die. The film, which opened in select theatres across the United States on September 21, 2012, also includes footage of a demonstration during mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1989. Subjects People featured in the film include: * Bill Bahlman * David Barr * Gregg Bordowitz * George H. W. Bush (archive footage) * Bill Clinton (archive footage) * Spencer Cox * Jim Eigo * Susan Ellenberg * Anthony S. Fauci * Mark Harrington * Jesse Helms (archive footage) * Garance Franke-Ruta * Larry Kramer * Mathilde Krim * Ed Koch * Iris Long * Ray Navarro * Ann Northrop * Bob Rafsky * Peter Staley Summary Beginning at the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in New York City, the documentary follows a group of AIDS activists and founders of the AIDS group ACT UP, and follows their struggle for response from the United States government and medical establishment in developing effective HIV/AIDS medications. Activists took it upon themselves to convince the FDA to approve drugs which could slow or even halt the AIDS virus, and demanded that drug trials (which would usually take 7‚Äì10 years) be shortened so potentially life-saving treatments could be made available. The film also documents the underground market for HIV drugs: many people relied on drugs imported from other countries, which were believed to potentially slow down the HIV virus despite not being FDA-approved. At the time, the only drug available to slow the progression of HIV was AZT, which in many cases was toxic to HIV-infected people, and in some cases even caused blindness. The cost of AZT was about $10,000 per year in the late 1980s. ACT UP's efforts led to the creation of the International AIDS Conference. Eventually, DDI, an alternative to AZT that did not cause blindness, was released by the FDA despite not going through a full-length safety trial. HIV activists also protested the immigration policies banning HIV-positive people from immigrating to the United States as being discriminatory and homophobic. When existing drugs proved ineffective as treatment for HIV, TAG lobbied for more research into the HIV virus. In 1996, protease inhibitors were released. These consist of a combination of drugs which lower the HIV viral load in patients more than any drug had before. It was considered a breakthrough in HIV and AIDS research and continues to be used as a treatment for HIV and AIDS. The documentary included interviews with HIV activists, physicians and members of underground organizations as well as clips of the protests, meetings and news coverage taking place during the 1980s and 1990s. France's book of the same title, expanding on the material, events, and people covered in the film, was published in 2016 to critical acclaim. It was described as \\"the definitive book on AIDS activism\\", was long-listed for the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence and was named to numerous best-of and top-ten lists, including the New York Times 100 Notable Books for 2016. Reception Critical response Currently, the film has a rating of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, and an average score of 8.40/10, based on 80 reviews. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Angry, powerful, and stirring, How to Survive a Plague is a brilliantly constructed documentary about the activists who pushed for action to combat the AIDS epidemic\\". It also has a score of 86 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/how-to-survive-a-plague AIDS historian Sarah Schulman has criticized the film for its focus on wealthy, white activists over the \\"different kinds of people from every class and background\\" involved in ACT UP.

The system was first noted on December 9, 2012, as a weak tropical depression about to the northeast of Suva, Fiji. Over the next couple of days the depression gradually developed further before it was named Evan on December 12, as it had developed into a tropical cyclone. During that day the system moved toward the Samoan Islands and gradually intensified, before the system slowed and severely affected the Samoan Islands during the next day with wind gusts of up to . The storm moved east and impacted the French islands of Wallis and Futuna before affecting Samoa and American Samoa. On December 16 Evan turned to the south and paralleled western areas of Fiji. Meteorological history During December 9, the Fiji Meteorological Service started to monitor Tropical Depression 04F, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone about to the northeast of Suva, Fiji. Over the next couple of days, the system gradually developed further, as it was steered eastwards by an upper level ridge of high pressure. During December 11, as the system passed near the island of Futuna, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated warnings on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P, after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm. During that day the precipitation radar on NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission observed a complete eyewall surrounding the system's eye, which NASA speculated could mean that Evan was stronger than originally thought. The FMS subsequently named the system Evan during December 12, after it had become a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After the system was named, the upper level ridge continued to steer Evan eastward, toward the Samoan islands, as the cyclone quickly intensified. During December 12, as the system started to impact the Samoan Islands with gale and storm force wind speeds, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had become a category 2 tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of . The JTWC also reported that day that the system had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS) with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Over the next 12 hours, the system developed a cloud-filled eye on visible imagery, while the system's forward motion started to slow down as it entered a weak steering environment with the upper level ridge of high pressure to the north of the system weakened and a subtropical ridge of high pressure developed to the south of the system. The system continued to intensify and started to recurve toward the west on December 16; at 1800 UTC (0700 UTC+13, December 17) the JTWC reported that Evan had reached an intensity of , which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the SSHS. Early on December 17 the JTWC reported that Cyclone Evan had reached its peak intensity with 1-minute windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHS. During that day Evan started to gradually weaken as it moved around the coast of the Fijian island of Viti Levu. With RSMC Nadi reporting by 1800 UTC (0700 UTC+13, December 18) that the system had weakened into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. By December 19, wind shear from the northwest had exposed the system's low level circulation center completely, pushing the bulk of convection and thunderstorm activity about to the southeast of the center. Evan had also moved into cooler sea surface temperatures, below 27 ¬∞C (81 ¬∞C), so evaporation and thunderstorm development had waned, needing to falling cloud heights because of less evaporation. On December 19, RSMC Nadi reported that Cyclone Evan had weakened below cyclone intensity and declassified it as a tropical cyclone, before the JTWC issued their final warning later that day as the system started to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Over the next couple of days the remnant low continued moving southwards and moved below 25¬∞S and into the Wellington tropical cyclone warning centre's (TCWC Wellington) area of responsibility. During December 21, the system started to move towards the southwest as it directed a moist tropical airmass onto the North Island during the next day. The remnants of Evan were last noted by TCWC Wellington during December 25. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Evan impacted the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Samoa, American Samoa, Niue, Tonga, Fiji and New Zealand, with 14 deaths reported and total damages estimated at over . As a result of its impact on the island nations, the name Evan was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. Fiji Buildings flattened by the storm in Fiji During December 10, the FMS issued heavy rain warnings for parts of Fiji, as the trough of low pressure associated with the system, was bringing heavy rain and squally thunderstorms to parts of Fiji which they warned could lead to flash floods in parts of the archipelago. These warnings were subsequently cancelled during the next day as the system moved away from Fiji, however they started to note that the global numerical weather guidance products were agreeing on the depression, re-curving as a tropical cyclone and to start directly impacting Fiji from December 16. During the next three days, the FMS issued calls for communities to be prepared, heed warnings and act responsibly, so that they could avoid \\"unnecessary loss of lives and properties\\", as Cyclone Evan was expected to be at least a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone when it entered Fijian waters. Between December 15 \\\\- 18 as the system approached and passed through the archipelago, the FMS issued various strong, gale, storm and hurricane-force wind warnings for Fiji. Ahead of the system approaching and impacting the island nation, people were evacuated to emergency shelters. Fiji Airways (Air Pacific) announced they are suspending all flights to Savusavu, as well as the international flights from Nadi to Auckland and Brisbane on December 16.Air Pacific cancels Savusavu flights (FBC News)Cyclone bears down on Fiji (SBS News) Upon passing over Fiji, over 8,000 people were living in shelters, including many tourists. Although there were no initial reports of casualties, the storm brought considerable damage. Trees and power lines were down across the island group. In addition, flooding and structural damage was reported from resorts and homes. Damage throughout Fiji amounted to FJ$169.9 million (US$108.8 million). Additionally, short-term economic losses related to the cyclone were estimated reach FJ$73.4 million (US$40.9 million). Wallis and Futuna Cyclone Evan affected Wallis and Futuna on two separate occasions while it was active, with the cyclone first affecting Futuna during December 11, before passing within of Wallis Island during December 15, and of Futuna Island during the next day. On December 11 Futuna Island recorded of rainfall and windspeeds of up to as Evan passed just to the north of the island. Ahead of the system affecting the French Territory for the second time, various warning alerts were issued for the two islands, with people were urged to prepare. As the system passed near Wallis island, wind gusts of up to were recorded, which were the highest recorded wind gusts on Wallis Island since records began in 1971. The cyclone passed through the French territory without any reported casualties, and while Futuna Island was spared any major damage, extensive damage was reported on Wallis Island.http://www.outre-mer.gouv.fr/?lurel-mercredi-et-jeudi-a-wallis- durement-frappee-par-le-cyclone-evan.html Samoa Cyclone Evan nearing the coast of Upolu, Samoa on December 13 Cyclone Evan affected the independent state of Samoa between December 11 and 15, and was considered to be the worst tropical cyclone to affect Samoa, since Cyclone Val in 1991. After the system was named on December 12, the Samoan Deputy and Acting Prime Minister Fonotoe Pierre Lauofo, signed a Disaster Declaration which lasted for 48 hours and activated all disaster response provisions of the Samoan National Disaster Management Plan. Alt URL During that day the Samoa Meteorology Division issued gale and storm force wind warnings and a hurricane watch for Samoa, while preparations for the system started with several people boarding up their homes. During the next day these preparations continued before the SMS issued a hurricane warning for Upolu, after marginal hurricane-force winds of were observed on Mount Fiamoe, Upolu. The cyclone struck, causing widespread damage in the capital, Apia. Many of the roads were blocked by flood waters and downed banana trees. Evan also caused damage to Faleolo International Airport in Apia, where the departures lounge collapsed, forcing its temporary closure. As a result, Fiji Airways (Air Pacific) cancelled all flights to Apia for December 14 and 15, citing safety concerns. Wind gusts of up to were reported. The storm destroyed houses and caused almost complete failures in the power and water supply systems. The Disaster Management Office reported that the Tanugamanono power plant was heavily damaged and power might not be restored for up to two months in some areas. A water treatment plant near Apia was also reported destroyed.Cyclone Evan rips through Samoa as Apia homes flattened, BBC, 14 December 2012 At least three deaths were reported after the storm, including two children who were in low-lying areas and drowned. Authorities expressed concern over about the fate of at least 7 people who are still missing, as well as up to 3,000 others now living in emergency shelters. The US Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa David Huebner confirmed the United States had provided NZ$60,000 to the Samoan Red Cross for relief operations. New Zealand authorities said they were also ready to provide financial aid, if the local government requests it. On December 15 they did provide NZ$50,000, as well as a P-3 Orion plane to search for eight missing fishermen. Two days later the New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced an additional NZ$550,000 was to be made available to the Samoan government, as well as the Samoan Red Cross and any agencies on the ground that might need it. Five additional New Zealand Red Cross workers were also sent to support local efforts. The Samoan Parliament opened with a somber prayer session, as the legislators prepared to receive initial assessments of the economic damage wrecked by Evan. According to reports, the bill is expected to be at least NZ$200,000,000, and possibly rise as high as 300 million. On December 17 Samoan authorities confirmed that the death toll reached 14, after rescuers abandoned the search for 10 missing sailors. In all, damage from the storm amounted to WS$465 million (US$204 million). American Samoa Enhanced infrared image of Evan on December 14 The Pago Pago National Weather Service Forecast Office issued a gale watch for all of American Samoa a day before the storm impacted the island. As Evan intensified and moved closer to the archipelago, hurricane warnings and flash flood watches were issued for Tutuila, Aunuu, Manua and Swains Island. On December 14 authorities announced that there had been no major damage or injuries after the passage of the storm. Tonga During December 13, a tropical cyclone alert was issued a tropical cyclone alert for the Tongan islands of Niuatoputapu and Niuafo'ou, as it was possible that the system could produce gale-force winds over the islands within 48 hours. However these alerts were cancelled during December 14, as Evan was no longer predicted to pass close enough to the islands to produce gale-force winds or any damage on either island. New Zealand During December 23, as Cyclone Evan's remnants moved towards New Zealand, TCWC Wellington issued Severe Weather Warnings for parts of Northland, Auckland and Coromandel as between of rain expected to fall which could cause surface flooding. They also predicted that parts of New Zealand would see strong or gale-force winds and that the eastern coasts of Northland, might see large sea waves of about . During that day in parts of the Coromandel Ranges, over of rain fell while in other parts of the warning area fell while the system was blamed for creating foggy conditions that engulfed parts of the North Island, and led to over 100 flights being cancelled at Wellington Airport.(Accessed via Lexis Nexis on December 24, 2012) On December 24, the threat of heavy rain, surface flooding, swells and strong to gale-force winds continued while a swimmer drowned in rough seas of Whiritoa beach. During that day heavy rain and the threat of flooding gradually eased, before the remnants were last noted during the next day.

(26 June 1898 ‚Äì 2 August 1958) was an Austrian art historian who was an officer in the SS and played a major role in the expropriation of art by the Nazis, particularly in Poland. He worked with Arthur Seyss-Inquart in the initial Nazi government in Vienna following the Anschluss, in the General Government (occupied Poland) and in The Hague where he headed an art clearing house in the occupied Netherlands known as the Dienststelle M√ºhlmann (M√ºhlmann Agency). He has been characterised as one of the greatest art thieves among the Nazis, and possibly ever. Life Early life and World War I M√ºhlmann was born on 26 June 1898 in Uttendorf, near Zell am See in Austria. His father died and his mother remarried to his father's cousin; the family included eight children, six of whom survived. M√ºhlmann's elder brother Josef was later to join the Gestapo. M√ºhlmann grew up on a farm and attended school in Salzburg.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 170‚Äì71. On reaching the required age of 17 in 1915, he volunteered for service in the First World War; he was decorated several times but in 1918 was seriously wounded and suffered a lung infection which affected his health for the rest of his life. At this time he joined the Socialist Party, and remained a member for several years.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 172. Salzburg In 1922 he entered university, studying art history in Innsbruck and Vienna, and in 1926 he completed his doctorate at the University of Vienna with a thesis on Baroque Fountains and Water Art in Salzburg.\\"M√ºhlmann, Kajetan (sometimes appearing Cajetan) 'Kai'\\", Dictionary of Art Historians, retrieved 17 December 2012. He then returned to Salzburg, where he acquired a reputation as a civic activist, advocating for the improvement of the city's landmarks and publishing a book on one preservationist's work, wrote generally positive art reviews, and worked as chief publicity agent for the Salzburg Festival.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 173. He spoke Austrian dialect and became known as a networker. People whom he met at this time and before and who later helped him in his career included Hermann G√∂ring (M√ºhlmann was friends with his sisters, who lived in the Salzburg area, and there is a story, which he denied, that he helped G√∂ring to escape from Germany after the failure of the Beerhall Putsch in Munich in 1923) and Arthur Seyss-Inquart.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 174‚Äì75. The Austrian Nazi Party was banned in July 1934 after the murder of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, and M√ºhlmann always denied having been a member then or earlier; however, both American Intelligence and Nazi sources state that he was an early member, and in 1935 he and five others were arrested in Salzburg and charged with being Nazis; the charge against M√ºhlmann was reduced from high treason to 'membership in a secret society' and his sentence reduced to time served, but according to a report by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the original sentence was 20 years. After his trial and conviction he continued to work as a liaison between those Nazis who remained in Austria and the party organisation and paramilitary forces in exile in Bavaria.Petropolous, Faustian Bargain, p. 175. While doing his best to avoid overt political affiliations, he became a prominent member of the moderate wing of the Austrian party, which ultimately triumphed over the radical faction;Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 175‚Äì77.Joseph Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik: Hitler's man in the East, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2004, , p. 41. early in 1938 he met with Hitler on behalf of Seyss-Inquart and gave him confidential information which strengthened his bargaining position in his meeting with Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, in addition to urging the removal of Josef Leopold.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 177‚Äì78.Bruce F.

Nicholas, The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War, New York: Knopf, 1994, , p. 40. Vienna Following the Anschluss in March 1938, Seyss-Inquart appointed him Secretary of State in the Federal Chancellery and then in the Ministry for Interior and Cultural Affairs, and also Representative for State Art Policy.Petropolous, Faustian Bargain, p. 179. He became a captain in the SS; he later rose to the rank of Oberf√ºhrer.Petropoulos, Art as Politics, p. 319. As head of Department III in the office of the Reichsstatthalter, which was responsible for the \\"administration and detachment of 'volksfeindliche' property\\" (i.e., that of \\"enemies of the Volk\\"), he played a major role in the confiscation of the property of Viennese Jews, which preceded the actions in the Altreich (pre- Anschluss Germany).Jonathan Petropoulos, Art as Politics in the Third Reich, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1996, , p. 85. In June 1939 he was fired by Josef B√ºrckel, the new Gauleiter of Vienna, ostensibly for sanctioning cabaret performances critical of Altreich Germans, but actually for \\"Austrian tendencies\\": funding Austrian cultural institutions outside Vienna and seeking to keep artworks expropriated from Viennese Jews in Vienna.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 185.Petropoulos, Art as Politics, pp. 91‚Äì92.Nicholas, p. 41. This was part of a wave of dismissals of Austrians on B√ºrckel's part which led to considerable resentment.Evan Burr Bukey, Hitler's Austria: Popular Sentiment in the Nazi Era, 1938‚Äì1945, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000, , p. 68. Occupied Poland After the invasion of Poland, G√∂ring offered him a position as his Special Delegate for the Securing of Artistic Treasures in the Former Polish Territories, his mission being to \\"secure\\" (plunder) artworks. He also had orders from Hitler through Reinhard Heydrich and from Hans Frank, who had been appointed Governor of the General Government (the German-occupied section of Poland);Petropolous, Faustian Bargain, p. 186. Seyss-Inquart was also sent to Poland as Deputy General Governor under Frank.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 187. Part of the rationale for the plundering of Poland was cultural impoverishment; the Nazis also killed off the intelligentsia, closed all institutions of higher education and instituted measures to reduce the birthrate.Petropoulos, Art as Politics, p. 101, citing Werner Rings, Life with the Enemy: Collaboration and Resistance in Hitler's Europe, 1939‚Äì1945, Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1982, , p. 26. In addition, as earlier in Austria, they took the legal position that the Jews were a separate nation with whom no peace treaty had been concluded at the end of the First World War, and whose property they were therefore at liberty to seize as that of an enemy. Thirdly, in a policy which had been laid down before the invasion of Poland, they claimed the right to repatriate \\"Germanic art\\", by which they understood all works by Germans and in addition all that had previously been in the possession of Germans.Petropoulos, p. 124. In the General Government, M√ºhlmann oversaw a \\"work staff\\" of nine art experts, eight with doctorates, and two commandos each with a dozen men: one, led by his brother Josef, was responsible for the northern part of the country above the 51st parallel and was based at the National Museum in Warsaw, the other, led by Gustav Barthel and based at the Jagellonian Library in Krak√≥w, for the south. Working outwards from the cities, they emptied state and private collections, universities, churches and monasteries.Petropoulos, Art as Politics, pp. 105‚Äì06. The artworks were classified into three grades: the top grade, Wahl I, were photographed and stored as reserved for the German Reich; the second grade, Wahl II, classified as \\"not necessarily worthy of the Reich, but of good quality\\", were stored either in Poland (primarily in the Jagellonian Library) or at the Deutsche Bank in Berlin; works of the third grade, Wahl III, were usually retained by the occupation administration or the SS, \\"for representational purposes\\", that is, for Germans' homes and offices.Petropoulos, Art as Politics, p. 107.Nicholas, p. 68. The Dienststelle M√ºhlmann in the Netherlands Leonardo Da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine M√ºhlmann's work in Poland was so efficient (by his own account, \\"within six months almost the entire artistic property of the land was seized\\") that Wolfram Sievers, business manager of the Ahnenerbe, wanted to have him oversee the removal of artworks from South Tyrol, which had been ceded to Italy.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 191. He visited the area in spring 1940 and reported to Sievers and to the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, arguing for the forceful removal of all Germanic art.Petropoulos, Art as Politics, p. 118. However, instead he was appointed to set up an office in The Hague, where he worked under his old associate Seyss- Inquart, heading the Dienststelle M√ºhlmann (M√ºhlmann Agency), which functioned as a clearing house for art expropriated during the occupation of the Netherlands, France (where they competed with a branch of the Amt Rosenberg), and also Austria and Poland, and also as the major dealership for selling art to Nazi leaders and for liquidating the rest.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 191‚Äì95. This was the most wideranging, ruthless and prolific Nazi plundering organisation.Morwenna Blewett, \\"Restorers in the Service of the Nazi Kleptocracy. A Case Study from the Sequestrations of the Dienststelle M√ºhlmann (the M√ºhlmann Agency)\\", in: Kunstgeschichte im \\"Dritten Reich\\": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken, ed. Olaf Peters, Ruth Heftrig and Barbara Schellewald, Schriften zur modernen Kunsthistoriographie 1, Berlin: Akademie, 2008, , pp. 393‚Äì404, p. 394. Most famously, M√ºhlmann acquired and catalogued the huge Mannheimer collection, which Hitler acquired for his projected F√ºhrermuseum in Linz in a forced sale that netted Seyss-Inquart a large commission.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 92, 194.Petropoulos, Art as Politics, p. 144.Nicholas, pp. 111‚Äì14, 174.Gerard Aalders, \\"The Looting and (Non)Restitution of Art in the Netherlands 1940‚Äì2001\\", in: Revisiting the National Socialist Legacy: Coming to Terms With Forced Labor, Expropriation, Compensation, and Restitution, ed.

Although he officially retained his post in Poland, he welcomed the move to a location where the occupation was in most ways less repressive, and also had found himself in a difficult position in Krak√≥w between the competing demands of different superiors: Martin Bormann had suggested that he should go to a concentration camp for not supplying enough art to Hitler, G√∂ring had threatened to have him put in prison for returning pictures including Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine to Poland from Berlin on Hans Frank's orders (in the end he carried it together with Raphael's Portrait of Gentleman and Rembrandt's Landscape with the Good Samaritan with him to Berlin by train twice),Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 1‚Äì2; according to Nicholas, p. 69, \\"Frank was allowed to keep them [in Krak√≥w].\\" and Frank's anger at him reportedly led to his leaving the position in Poland, which he did in mid- or late 1943.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 1‚Äì2, 195, saying he left the post in Poland in October.Christian Fuhrmeister and Susanne Kienlechner, \\"Tatort Nizza: Kunstgeschichte zwischen Kunsthandel, Kunstraub und Verfolgung. Zur Vita von August Liebmann Mayer, mit einem Exkurs zu Bernhard Degenhart und Bemerkungen zu Erhard G√∂pel und Bruno Lohse\\", Kunstgeschichte im \\"Dritten Reich\\", pp. 405‚Äì30, p. 424 gives 9 October 1939 to mid-1943 as the dates of his posting in Poland. Postwar In July 1944, seeing the war as lost, M√ºhlmann retreated to Vienna; he had already sent his wife and children to safety.Petropolous, Faustian Bargain, p. 196. He had no official duties, but advised many powerful Nazis; for example, Ernst Kaltenbrunner consulted him about forming a transitional Austrian government which might be acceptable to the Allies.Petropolous, Faustian Bargain, p. 197. He was captured by the Americans in Seewalchen in the Austrian Alps on 13 June 1945. At his interrogation, he confessed to expropriating the property of Jews but claimed not to have known about the Holocaust. He also claimed to have worked for the resistance and to have freed G√∂ring from imprisonment by the SS. He supplied useful testimony against leading Nazis and therefore in 1947 he was returned to Munich into the custody of the American military government in Bavaria; there he helped identify artworks and antiques. In February 1948, he became ill and was taken to the hospital, from which he managed to escape. Despite both Polish and Austrian efforts to extradite him, he was never recaptured. In 1951‚Äì52 he was tried in Vienna in absentia and found guilty of high treason; his property was declared forfeit, but the authorities were only able to find a portion of it. He lived in Southern Bavaria near Lake Starnberg, periodically selling artworks which he had hidden and left with friends, and occasionally visiting his wife and children; his ex-wife lived near them.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. 200‚Äì03. In 1958, he was operated on in Munich for stomach cancer, but died of it there on 2 August. His widow had his body returned to Salzburg for burial.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 204. Private life In 1932, M√ºhlmann married Leopoldine \\"Poldi\\" Wojtek (also called Woytek), a successful Salzburg artist. Her father, Josef Wojtek, was a building official in the city until 1938.Albert Lichtblau, \\"Arisierungen\\", beschlagnahmte Verm√∂gen, R√ºckstellungen und Entsch√§digungen in Salzburg, Ver√∂ffentlichungen der √ñsterreichischen Historikerkommission 17/2, Vienna/Munich: Oldenbourg, 2004, , pp. 112‚Äì13 He divorced her in 1941 and the following year, with Himmler's permission, married his mistress, Hilde Ziegler.Petropolous, Faustian Bargain, p. 181. He had four children. As a fugitive in Bavaria after the war, he reportedly had several romantic relationships, including with Leni Riefenstahl.Petropolous, Faustian Bargain, p. 203. Assessment M√ºhlmann was one of the most successful art thieves of Nazism. He was described in 1946 as \\"the most implacable Nazi in the group of looters held for American interrogation during the summer [of] 1945.\\"James S. Plaut, \\"Hitler's Capital\\", The Atlantic, October 1946. and Jonathan Petropoulos, an art historian specialising in Nazi plundering, has called him \\"arguably the single most prodigious art plunderer in the history of human civilization.\\"Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 170. He acquired considerable property for himself during his Nazi career. In addition to numerous paintings and antiques (one 1941 bill from a Parisian dealer totals 560,000 francs for rugs, crystal lamps, and furniture),Nicholas, p. 76. he used various \\"Aryanised\\" residences including a villa in Anif, a suburb of Salzburg, that was taken from a Jewish woman, Helene von Taussig, in 1941 for Josef Wojtek's use and transferred to the ownership of his daughter, M√ºhlmann's then wife; she continued to live there after the war.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 181.Lichtblau, pp. 113‚Äì14. During his tenure as Secretary of State in Vienna, he lived in a flat at the Belvedere Palace, and at war's end the Americans found in his then Vienna home a triptych taken from a Jewish art dealer plus stored cases of Dutch soap, Bols liqueur, rugs and lamps. He was committed to the \\"re-Germanising\\" of eastern territories which he and others thought of as having been usurped by Slavs, and wrote books during the war in which he described the cultural heritage of Krak√≥w in particular from this point of view. A book on the city which he co-wrote with Barthel begins: > The Ostmark, the Sudetenland, Eastern Silesia, the region of the river > Weichsel‚Äîmany names characteri[s]e a piece of German history from an inner > consistency that affects us all deeply. German history in the East: that is > the fulfillment of a thousand year old struggle and fight of Germanic life > energy ... Already centuries ago [this region] was settled and secured by > our Germanic ancestors.Kajetan M√ºhlmann and Gustav Barthel, Krakau. > Hauptstadt der deutschen Generalgouvernements Polen: Gestalt und > k√ºnstlerische Leistung einer deutschen Stadt im Osten, Krak√≥v: Amt des > Generalgouverneurs Abteilung Volksaufkl√§rung und Propaganda / Breslau: Korn, > 1940, , , p. 5, quoted in translation in Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, pp. > 189‚Äì90 and Poprzeczny, p. 43. However, his helping friends extended to those not popular with the Nazis, such as , a poet who was General Secretary of the Fatherland Front; Zernatto had worked hard to obtain M√ºhlmann's release from prison in 1935, so when the Germans entered Vienna in March 1938, M√ºhlmann enabled him to escape through a side door of the Federal Chancellery.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p. 176. As his second wife said, regarding modern art \\"[h]e was never entirely true to the Nazi line\\": when in office in Vienna, he had a fresco by Anton Faistauer on the Salzburg Festspielhaus preserved and approved funds to purchase work by the Expressionist , which helped the artist and his eight children to survive.Petropoulos, Faustian Bargain, p, 180.

Sarkar composed a total of 5,018 songs, including the lyrics and the melody, over a period of eight years from 1982 until his death in 1990. While most songs are in the Bengali language, some are in Hindi, English, Sanskrit, Urdu, Magahi, Maithili and Angika. Prabh√°ta Sa·∏øgiita is also sometimes considered to be a post-Tagore gharana (school of music). The poetry of lyrics expresses elements of love, mysticism, devotion, neohumanism and revolution and the songs present a wide spectrum of both Eastern and Western melodic styles.  Etymology  In Bengali, the word prabh√°t(a) (‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶§ - ) means dawn, morning or daybreak. The word sau·πãgiit(a) (‡¶∏‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡ßÄ‡¶§ - ) also spelled sa·∏øgiit(a) (‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ó‡ßÄ‡¶§ - ) means song and music. Thus, prabh√°t(a) sau·πãgiit(a) or prabh√°t(a) sa·∏øgiit(a) etymologically means \\"morning song\\" or \\"songs of dawn\\". It has also been interpreted as \\"songs of a new dawn\\". Irrelevant of the etymology, Prabh√°t(a) being the name of the composer, signifies \\"songs of Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar\\"  Name and variants  Prabh√°t Sa·∏øgiit has two most commonly used definitions, namely: \\"Songs of a New Down\\" and \\"Songs of Prabhat\\". It has many spelling variants, with the following reasons: the word sa·∏øgiit has two different spellings in Bengali, there is no fix transliteration rule for most Indian languages, there are also different transcription conventions used in English for Indian languages, the Sanskrit pronunciation has an \\"a\\" at the end of both words, which is normally silent in Bengali and Hindi. Thus we have the word prabhat that can be spelled as: *Prabhat, Prabh√°t, PrabhƒÅt, Prabhata, Prabh√°ta, PrabhƒÅta And we have the word samgiit that can be spelled as: *Sangit, Sangeet, Sangiit, Samgiit, Sa·∏øgiit, Sa·πÉgƒ´t, Sau·πãgiit, Sa≈ãgƒ´t and all of these with \\"a\\" at the end: *Sangita, Sangeeta, Sangiita, Samgiita, Sa·∏øgiita, Sa·πÉgƒ´ta, Sau·πãgiita and Sa≈ãgƒ´ta If combined, all these variations could create a huge number of spelling variants for Prabhat Samgiit, however not all combinations are used. Subhas Sarkar mainly prefers the variant Prabh√°ta Sa·∏øgiita and sometimes uses PrabhƒÅta sa·πÉgƒ´ta. There is no consistency of spelling, even within the same newspapers. The Hindu often spells Prabhat Samgiita however also spells Prabhat Sangit and also Prabhat Sangeet. The Times of India uses both Prabhat Samgiita and Prabhat Sangeet. Most other newspapers spell Prabhat Sangeet, though some articles prefer Prabhat Sangit and Prabhata Samgiita. Publications of Ananda Marga usually goes by the spelling Prabh√°ta Sa·∏øgiita and also often by Prabh√°t Sa·∏øgiita and Prabh√°t Sa·∏øgiit. Older publications, however, tend to use the variant Prabh√°t Sau·πãgiit or Prabh√°ta Sau·πãgiita. Finally there are instances of unusual spellings as well, such as Prabhat Sangeeth and Prabhat Samhitta.  Composition, Collection and Releases  P. R. Sarkar composed the first prabhat samgiita Bandhu he niye calo in Bengali on 14 September 1982 at Deoghar, India. He continued composing songs until his death on 21 October 1990. During that eight years, he composed a total of 5,018 prabhat samgiits, of which almost all in Bengali including the lyrics and the tunes. The last prabhat samgiit, √Åmr√° ga≈ïe nova gurukul, was composed on 20 October 1990, one day before his death Sarkar created the Ananda Marga organization in 1955 and by 1973 Ananda Marga Publications was established to translate and distribute his work as well as works relating to Sarkar. The multivolume English/Bengali edition was published in 1993 and two smaller volumes of selected works in English followed. Another Ananda Marga-affiliated group, the Renaissance Artists and Writers Association (RAWA), has sponsored several performances and recordings of selected songs. These performances have featured artists such as Acarya Tattvavedananda Avadhuta, Acarya Priyashivananda Avadhuta, Madhuri Chattopadhay, Srikanto Acharya, Arundhati Home Choudhury, Ramkumar Chattopadhay, Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande, Rashid Khan, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Manoj Kumar, Vithal Rao, Shruti Sadolikar, Haimanti Sukla and Archana Udupa.70 Questions and Answers on Prabhat Samgiita by Ac.

In contrast to the public television broadcast of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People was telecast in the U.S. in November 1982 as an Operation Prime Time presentation on some 100 independent commercial stations across the country. The bridge leading from East to West Berlin for the defection scene was found in the Midlands city of Nottingham. Other location shooting was done in Berne, Hamburg, Paris, and London. Reception The initial reviews were good, but the enthusiasm decreased as the series progressed. A contemporary review in The New York Times described the production as a \\"marvelously riveting television film\\" and referred to Guinness's performance as stunning and the supporting company as outstanding. The review summarized the series as \\"the best show you are likely to see on television for the time being.\\" In a retrospective review, Neal Justin of the Star Tribune called Guinness's portrayal of Smiley as \\"a master class in subtle acting.\\" Mark Lawson of The Guardian called the adaptation, \\"among the most beautiful and enduring achievements of TV drama.\\" Awards In 1983 Smiley's People won four BAFTA awards, including Best Actor (for Alec Guinness) and Best Actress (for Beryl Reid), and was nominated for six others. The series also won a Peabody Award.

The hall was once part of the Hopton Castle Estate and for 200 years was the home of the Bayley family. In 1943 it was purchased by the Bilston Corporation, who planned to develop it into a children's home, which did not happen, and in 1947 it was bought by Thomas Watkins.Evans, A T D (2008) Border Wanderings page 52 The hall continues as a private residence, and there remains a small sheep farm on the estate. The placename is derived from \\"broad ford\\"; the exact location of where this ford was is unknown and no ford exists in modern times (the crossing being replaced by Broadward Bridge). The historic change of the second element of the name, from \\"ford\\" to \\"ward\\", is the reverse of what happened to the placename of Clungunford. To the east of the hall, and adjacent to a public right of way, is an old motte () originating from medieval times after the Norman conquest, which is designated as a scheduled monument. It was built to control the crossing of the River Clun (by way of the old ford) and is only big enough to have supported a watch tower.

The artefacts were over a metre below modern-day ground level and are believed to have been offerings to water gods in what was a marshy landscape; the level of the ground has since risen in the area (by natural process of alluvial material deposited in times of flood) and the area has also now been drained for agriculture.

These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma. Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood. These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV). Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age. HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development. In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma. Thus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma. Asthma According to Hertzen (2002), a common characteristic of asthmatic patients is to have epithelial cells that respond to injury by enhancing the capability of producing proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines, instead of repairing the injured epithelial layer. As a result, inflammation and associated healing process leads to scar formation and tissue remodelling, which are symptoms that can be found in almost all asthmatics patients. Thus, asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Asthma is divided into two subgroups: atopic (extrinsic) and non-atopic (intrinsic). The atopic subgroup is closely associated with family history of the disease, whereas the non-atopic subgroup has its onset in adulthood and it is not caused by inheritance. It is known that non-atopic asthma has a more severe clinical course than atopic asthma. Non-atopic asthma may be caused by chronic viral, bacterial infections, or colonization with pathogenic bacteria. Associated Microorganisms Chlamydophila pneumoniae =General descriptions= File:Chlamydia pneumoniae.jpg Chlamydophila pneumoniae, formerly known as Chlamydia pneumoniae, is a bacterium that belongs to the phylum Chlamydiae, order Chlamydiales, and genus Chlamydophila. It is rod-shaped and Gram-negative. It has a characteristic pear-shaped elementary body (EB) that is surrounded by a periplasmic space, which makes it morphologically distinct from the round EBs of C. trachomatis and C. psittaci. C. pneumoniae is non-motile and utilizes aerobic respiration. As an obligate intracellular bacterium, C. pneumoniae is both parasitic and mesophilic. =Biological interactions with host= C. pneumoniae is able to grow in monocytes, macrophages, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. It replicates within the host cell cytoplasm. Due to the fact that it does not have the ability to synthesize its own ATP, it is entirely dependent on energy produced by their host. Reinfection of the host with C. pneumoniae is common because the memory immunity elicited by C. pneumoniae is short-lived and partial. In addition, C. pneumoniae infection tends to be persistence due to IFN-Œ≥, penicillin and nutrient deficiencies. These deficiencies prevent C.pneumoniae from completing their normal developmental cycle, leading to the formation of aberrant, noninfectious C. pneumoniae that persist in the human host. C. pneumonia infection may not only be persistent and chronic, but it also has irreversible tissue injury and scarring processes, which are symptoms in asthma patients. Infection with C. pneumoniae induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Among the two immune responses, cell-mediated immune response that involves CD8+ T cells in particular is crucial to eradicate C. pneumoniae, whereas the humoral immune response appears to be rather ineffective in protection against C. pneumonia infection. In fact, CD8+ T cells are so important that if it is absent in the host, the C. pneumonia infection would progress rapidly. Although cell- mediated immune response is responsible for the clearance of C. pneumoniae, this response can be harmful to the host because it favours the development of inflammation that can lead to asthma. =Roles in asthma= There is a strong association of C. pneumoniae with long-standing asthma among the non- atopic asthma in comparison to atopic asthma. In fact, the severity of asthma can be determined by the elevated titres to C. pneumoniae, but not to other potential pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenovirus, influenza A and B or parainfluenza virus. It is hypothesized that C. pneumoniae is associated with asthma because C. pneumoniae has been found to cause ciliostasis in bronchial epithelial cells. Meanwhile, sero-epidemiological data also provide evidences to support that C. pneumoniae plays a role in asthma by amplifying inflammation and inciting the disease process. The association of C. pneumoniae and asthma begins with C. pneumoniae producing 60-kDa heat shock proteins that provide a prolonged antigenic stimulation. This particular heat shock protein is known as a member of hsp60 family of stress proteins, which can be found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The production of hsp60 remains unaltered even when C. pneumoniae is dormant and does not replicate, since that hsp60 serves as a protective antigen. Its antigenic stimulation strongly amplifies chronic inflammation by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±, interleukin (IL)-1Œ≤, IL-6 and IFN-Œ≥ by infected cells, which ultimately leads to immunopathological tissue damage and scarring in the asthmatic lungs. Furthermore, infection with C. pneumonia also induces serum immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG responses, which are associated with chronic asthma. Mycoplasma pneumoniae =General descriptions= M. pneumoniae is a bacterium that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Mollicutes, order Mycoplasmatales and family Mycoplasmataceae. It is either filamentous or spherical. Individual spindle-shaped cells of M. pneumoniae are 1 to 2 ¬µm long and 0.1 to 0.2 ¬µm wide. M. pneumoniae is a motile, mesophilic bacterium that exhibits obligate aerobic respiration. It is an extracellular, host-associated bacterium that lacks a cell wall and is unable to survive outside of a host due to osmotic instability in the environment. =Biological interactions with host= M. pneumoniae can cause infections in humans, animals, plants, and cell cultures. It is a parasitic bacterium that invades the mucosal membranes of the upper and lower respiratory tract, including nasopharynx, throat, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. In order to survive, M. pneumoniae needs essential nutrients and compounds such as amino acids, cholesterol, precursors to nucleic acid synthesis, and fatty acids obtained from the mucosal epithelial cells of the host. Its adhesion proteins attach to tracheal epithelial cells by sialoglycoproteins or sialoglycolipid receptors, which are located on its cell surface. It may cause injury to the respiratory epithelial cell after its attachment. The injury of host epithelial cells caused by M. pneumoniae adhesion is thought to be due to the production of highly reactive species: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radicals (O2‚Äì). M. pneumoniae has the potential for intracellular localization. The intracellular existence of M. pneumoniae could facilitate the establishment of latent or chronic states, circumvent mycoplasmacidal immune mechanisms, its ability to cross mucosal barriers and gain access to internal tissues. Besides, fusion of the mycoplasmal cell membrane with that of the host not only results in the release of various hydrolytic enzymes produced by the mycoplasma, but also leads to the insertion of mycoplasmal membrane components into the host cell membrane, a process that could potentially alter receptor recognition sites and affect cytokine induction and expression. As stated by Nisar et al. (2007), M. pneumonia can persist in the respiratory tract up to several months after recovery from acute pneumonia. In fact, M. pneumonia can be cultured from respiratory secretions even after the pneumonia patients are treated with effective antibiotics. Thus, M. pneumonia infection is chronic and persistent. Besides, Nisar et al. (2007) also adds that M. pneumonia infection causes pulmonary structural abnormalities, resulting in a decrease in expiratory flow rates and an increase in airways hyper-responsiveness in non-asthmatic individuals. =Roles in asthma= M. pneumonia infection is responsible for triggering exacerbation of asthma in 3.3 to 50% in such cases. Furthermore, M. pneumonia may also precede the onset of asthma, because patients with an acute infection by M. pneumonia, followed by the development of asthma, have significant improvement in lung function and asthma symptoms after they are given antimicrobial treatment against M. pneumonia. The release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to M. pneumoniae infection has been indicated as a possible mechanism leading to bronchial asthma. This is because the increase of cytokine production results in a continuing inflammatory response in the airway, followed by negative effects such as immunopathological tissue damage and scarring as described in the C. pneumonia‚Äôs role in asthma section. Furthermore, patients with asthma are found to have an increased release of type II cytokines, especially IL4 and IL5, but a normal or low level of type I cytokine production. Similarly, M. pneumoniae infection promotes a T helper type 2 response, which is why M pneumoniae-positive patients with asthma have increased airways expression of tumour necrosis factor a, IL4 and IL5. The T helper type 2 predominant airways disease caused by M. pneumonia infection may lead to IgE-related hyper- responsiveness and eosinophil function, resulting in an onset of asthma. There is also a possibility that M. pneumoniae infection may destroy respiratory mucosal cells and facilitate the penetration of antigens into the mucosa. A study done by Laitinen et al. (1976) suggests that M. pneumoniae infection denude the epithelial surface and expose irritant receptors. On top of that, M. pneumoniae induces the activation of mast cells by releasing serotonin and hexosaminidase. By producing antigen, M. pneumonia is capable of initiating an antibody response. Its antigen interacts with IgE that attaches to mast cells, leading to the stimulation of histamine release followed by airway obstruction. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) =General descriptions= File:Human rhinovirus.jpg Rhinoviruses are known to be the most important common cold viruses. They are ssRNA positive-strand viruses with no DNA stage, and are classified within the family Picornaviridae. Rhinoviruses are small, with the length of approximately 30 nm, and do not contain an envelope. Their icosahedral capsids contain 4 proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. VP1, VP2, and VP3 are located on the surface of the capsid and are responsible for the antigenic diversity of Rhinoviruses. In contrast, VP4 is located inside the virus and its function is to anchor the RNA core to the viral capsid. While sharing basic properties with enteroviruses, such as size, shape, nucleic acid composition, and ether-resistance, rhinoviruses are distinguished from enteroviruses by having a greater buoyant density and a susceptibility to inactivation if they are exposed to an acidic environment. Nevertheless, they share a common ancestor with enteroviruses. =Biological interactions with host= The optimal temperature for rhinovirus replication is 33-35 ¬∞C, which corresponds to the temperature of nasal mucosa. At 37 ¬∞C virus replication rate falls to 10% to 50% of optimum. This may be the major reason why rhinoviruses can replicate better in the nasal passages and upper tracheobronchial tree than in the lower respiratory tract. Most of the rhinovirus serotypes bind to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), whereas approximately 10% of the serotypes bind to the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Normally, rhinoviruses would infect small clusters of cells in the epithelial layer with little cellular cytotoxicity. Although an increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophils are shown in infected nasal epithelium, little or no mucosal damage occurs from the infection. Nevertheless, rhinovirus infection leads to symptoms of the common cold, which is primarily an upper airway illness. Rhinovirus receptors are insensitive to neuraminidase but are sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. =Roles in asthma = Asthmatic subjects in 9 to 11 years old, 80% to 85% of asthma exacerbations that were associated with reduced peak expiratory flow rates and wheezing were due to viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). High rates of asthma attacks due to rhinovirus infection are also found in adults. It turns out that rhinovirus are capable of inducing epithelial cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines that result in airway hyperresponsiveness, neurogenic inflammatory responses, mucous secretion, inflammatory cell recruitment and activation, and plasma leakage. To support this statement, asthmatic subjects that are infected with rhinovirus have demonstrated an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness, airway obstruction, and inflammation. Similarly, rhinovirus infection has caused subjects with allergic rhinitis but no history of asthma to have a significantly increased airway hyperreactivity as well as a significantly increased incidence of late asthmatic reactions. This shows that in addition to causing airway hyperreactivity, rhinovirus also promotes the onset of non- atopic asthma. Furthermore, rhinovirus infection also promotes eosinophil recruitment to airway segments after antigen challenges, and thus intensifies airway inflammatory response to antigens, leading to the development of asthma.

PP went online in 1992 at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory; since 1999 it has operated from Columbia University and in 2009 it moved to the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen. Although many servers have implemented particular aspects, PP remains the most widely used public server for structure prediction: over 1.5 million requests from users in 104 countries have been handled; over 13000 users submitted 10 or more different queries. PP web pages are mirrored in 17 countries on 4 continents. The system is optimized to meet the demands of experimentalists not experienced in bioinformatics.

Attempt to simplify output by incorporating a hierarchy of thresholds  The attempt to ‚Äòpre-digest‚Äô as much information as possible to simplify the ease of interpreting the results is a unique pillar of PP.

In Nebraska and South Dakota it is also classified as the Ogallala Group. Notably, it records the North American Land Mammal Ages (NALMAs) Hemphillian, Clarendonian, and Barstovian. It also includes an excellent record of grass seeds and other plant seeds, which can be used for biostratigraphic dating within the formation. The Ogallala Formation outcrops of Lake Meredith National Recreation Area preserve fish fossils. Similar specimens from the same unit are found at Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument in Texas.  Development  At the beginning of the Rocky Mountains uplift, the final floor of the Western Interior Seaway was elevated several thousand feet (thousands of meters) above sea level. The previous pattern of erosion of material from the northeast into the midcontinent was largely reversed so that material eroded from the Rocky Mountains was carried eastward on to expansive, geologically weathered plains. This material included quartz and feldspar from Precambrian granite, but also residue from the uplifted shale, limestone, and sandstone accumulated from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods, as well as igneous rock from Cenozoic volcanism. Many rivers carried this material from the mountains to the east. What each river carried from different parts of the mountains varied, changing also as the geography of the Rocky Mountains evolved. Owing to the low amount of sloping, vast quantities of sand and gravel were dumped on the plains in broad and overlapping alluvial fans rather than being carried into the Mississippi River. Over this time, many volcanic ash falls occurred and have been identified to their source, including several from the Yellowstone Supervolcano and two from the Jemez Caldera.  Lithostratigraphy  From bottom to top, the Ogallala was deposited as overlapping alluvial fans of sand and gravel, displaying bedding resulting from river flows and flooding. Much of this material remained unconsolidated; however, significant modification occurred as the material deepened, particularly with the cementation of the sand and gravel with calcium carbonate and silica. The top of the Ogallala is defined by a thick cap rock of hard limestone or caliche, broadly called \\"algal limestone\\". Patterns of thin lines in the \\"limestone\\" suggested algal origin to frontier geologists (calcite and silica deposited within mats of algae under a shallow lake). However, the material is determined to be mostly caliche that formed after deposition of the sand and gravel from the mountain rivers was sharply reduced and the climate became arid or semiarid. This extensive and resistant material established the broad flat expanses of the High Plains. Most of the material that overlies this bed is wind-blown Pleistocene loess, while the Blanco Formation overlies the Ogallala in Texas and southwestern Kansas. Much of the underlying sand and gravel is unconsolidated or poorly consolidated such that it easily erodes away, leaving in western Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas a range of dramatic high bluffs that define the boundary of a \\"high plain\\". The lowest, oldest deposits filled in the shallow valleys of the weathered rocks that were exposed at that time, which ranged in age from Cretaceous in Nebraska and Kansas to Permian in Texas. As the rivers built up the alluvial fans, subsurface water circulation varied, resulting in localized formation of caliche, and shallow lakes formed between natural levees, which deposited limestone. These consolidated lenses, distributed in within the middle portion, do not represent any particular horizon; but do cap intermediate bluffs below valley rims. Because of their bluff-forming nature and resemblance to concrete or mortar, these lenses are described as \\"caprock\\" or \\"mortar beds\\". Various ash falls were locally deposited, supplying silica for the formation of agate and chert in the upper portion and opal in the lowest portion. Other than the lower opaline sandstone zone and the \\"Algal limestone\\", the Ogallala has no persistent lithological marker beds beyond the stated generalities of local chert beds in the upper zone and local caliche \\"mortar bed\\" lenses in the middle zone. It may be the case that consolidation of the caliche of the \\"Algal limestone\\" occurred broadly at the same time but in whatever material was at the local surface after deposition of the sand and gravel ceased. And, while the \\"Algal limestone\\" is a marker bed, it does not establish correlation of the specific beds in which the caliche formed.  Biostratigraphy  Faced with particularly rich collections of terrestrial Neogene vertebrate fossils, Nebraska geologists recognized the distinct North American land mammal ages (NALMA) within the Ogallala; Clarendonian, Hemphillian, and Blancan sufficient to attempt definitions of formations on a biostratigraphic basis. The Ogallala's rich grass seed record was also used to develop biostratigraphic successions within the unit. Unfortunately, no correlation with any consistent rock bedding can be established over the Ogallala's range. Nebraska‚Äôs biostratigraphic classifications elevated the Ogallala to group status with three members Kimball (youngest), Ash Hollow, and Valentine (oldest). Kansas geologists attempted to carry these classifications into the state; but, the state has since abandoned the three divisions. Like the remainder of High Plains states, Kansas considers the Ogallala to be a formation. However, it is convenient to informally divide the Ogallala into the three general zones with these names: * Kimball - the upper zone with the \\"Algal limestone\\", agate, and chert beds * Ash Hollow - the broad middle zone with the additional caprock \\"mortar beds\\" * Valentine - the lowest zone with the opaline sandstone  Gallery  See also * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Nebraska * Paleontology in Nebraska * Blanco Canyon References ;Footnotes ;Sources * Hunt, ReBecca K., Vincent L.

Defining Black Feminist Thought Black feminist thought is a field of knowledge that is focused on the perspectives and experiences of Black women. There are several arguments in support of this definition. First, Berger and Luckmann (1966); and Mannheim (1936) similarly argue that the definition implies that the overall content of the thought and the historical and factual circumstances of Black women are inseparable. Proposition is that other groups in the field act as merely transcribers whereas Black women are the actual authors. Second, the definition assumes that Black women possess a unique standpoint on, or perspective of, their experiences and that there will be certain commonalities of perception shared by Black women as a group. Third, while living life as Black women may produce certain commonalities of outlook, the diversity of class, region, age, and sexual orientation shaping individual Black women's lives has resulted in different expressions of these common themes. Thus, universal themes included in the Black women's standpoint may be experienced and expressed differently by distinct groups of Afro-American women. Finally, the definition assumes that, while a Black women's standpoint exists, its contours may not be clear to Black women themselves. Therefore, one role for Black female intellectuals is to produce facts and theories about the Black female experience that will clarify a Black woman's standpoint for Black women. In other words, Black feminist thought contains observations and interpretations about Afro-American womanhood that describe and explain different expressions of common themes. Black women's insistence on self- definition, self-valuation, and the necessity for a Black female-centered analysis is significant for two reasons. First, defining and valuing one's consciousness of one's own self-defined standpoint in the face of images that foster a self-definition as the objectified \\"other\\" is an important way of resisting the dehumanization essential to systems of domination. The status of being the \\"other\\" implies being \\"other than\\" or different from the assumed norm of white male behavior. In this model, powerful white males define themselves as subjects, the true actors, and classify people of color and white women in terms of their position vis-a-vis this white male hub. Since Black women have been denied the authority to challenge these definitions, this model consists of images that define Black women as a negative other, the virtual antithesis of positive white male images. Moreover, as Britain and Maynard (1984:199) point out, \\"domination always involves the objectification of the dominated; all forms of oppression imply the devaluation of the subjectivity of the oppressed.\\" Book description In spite of the double burden of racial and gender discrimination, African-American women have developed a rich intellectual tradition that is not widely known. In Black Feminist Thought, originally published in 1990, Patricia Hill Collins set out to explore the words and ideas of Black feminist intellectuals and writers, both within the academy and without. Here Collins provides an interpretive framework for the work of such prominent Black feminist thinkers as Angela Davis, bell hooks, Alice Walker, and Audre Lorde. Drawing from fiction, poetry, music and oral history, the result is a book that provided the first synthetic overview of Black feminist thought and its canon.Hill, Collins Patricia. Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment. New York: Routledge, 2000. Print.  Key concepts   Outsider-within  Patricia Hill Collins coins the term outsider-within in a former essay and redefines the term in her book to describe the experience of black women. In the book, she historically situates the term to describe the social location of black women in domestic work pre-World War II. While the domestic work gave black women an opportunity \\"to see White elites, both actual and aspiring, from perspectives largely obscured from Black men and from these groups themselves,\\" they were still economically exploited by their white employers. Collins asserts that black women cannot fully be a member of feminist thought nor black social thought because the former assumes whiteness while the latter assumes maleness. The makeup of their identity and consequently their experiences as black women maintain their position as outsiders within spaces of oppression. However, as Collins notes, the black woman's position as an outsider-within provides her with a unique perspective on social, political, intellectual, and economic realities. Therefore, although black women are marginalized they can bring a more nuanced outlook to feminist and social thought.  Intellectual activism  Collins pinpoints intellectual activism as a key process in developing black feminist thought. She articulates the reclaiming of \\"black feminist intellectual traditions\\" as one of the most important pillars of intellectual activism. Since the intellectual work of black women has been suppressed for so long, reclaiming and centering these works not only preserves the intellectual traditions of past black women but also encourages continued contributions to black feminist thought. Collins also notes the importance in \\"discovering, reinterpreting, and analyzing the ideas of subgroups within the larger collectivity of U.S. Black women who have been silenced\\" meaning that we must also give equal attention to the groups of black women who have been especially marginalized, such as black lesbians. Collins describes the relationship between past and present intellectual traditions, suggesting that we use black feminists' theoretical frameworks of today, such as, race, class, and gender, to interpret the intellectual traditions of previously silenced black women. Collins' focus goes beyond black female academics; she argues that all forms of works be considered as black women's social thought which questions the definition of \\"intellectual\\" and allows for poetry, music, etc. to be considered as valid forms of social thought.  Matrix of domination  The matrix of domination refers to how intersections of oppression are structurally organized. It explains the way \\"structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal domains of power reappear across quite different forms of oppression\\". The matrix of domination is made up of varying combinations of intersecting oppression such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, age, and sexuality. Collins' matrix of domination works in four different domains: the structural domain, the disciplinary domain, the hegemonic domain, and the interpersonal domain. The structural domain functions to organize power and oppression, the disciplinary manages oppression in attempts to sustain it, the hegemonic functions to legitimize oppression, and the interpersonal domain controls the interactions and consciousness of individuals. Although all black women are within the matrix of domination, the differences in the intersections of oppression make the experiences and the perspectives of black women differ.  Controlling images  Collins' discussion of controlling images focuses on the negative stereotypical representations and images of black women. These representations continue to oppress black women as they continue to perpetuate the dominant subject's definition of the object i.e. the black woman. The images' pervasive nature aid in sustaining intersecting oppression because they \\"[reflect] the dominant group's interest in maintaining Black women's subordination. These images are used to make black women's oppression seem natural and normal. Collin's critique on controlling images includes an analysis of the mammy, the welfare mother, and the jezebel. She explains that the images constitute different oppressions simultaneous: the mammy works to make the defeminized black women and all oppressive factors against her seem natural, the welfare mother works to make the economically unfit black women and all oppressive factors against her seem natural, and the jezebel works to make the hypersexual black women and all oppressive factors against her seem natural.  Self-definition  Self-definition is \\"the power to name one's own reality\\" Collins articulates black women's resistance against controlling images as an important step for practicing self-definition. The rejection of the dominant group's definition of black women and black women's imposition of their own self-definition indicates a \\"collective Black women's consciousness\\". The expression of the black women's consciousness and standpoint is an integral part of developing Black feminist thought. Collins notes the importance of safe spaces for black women, where self-definition is not clouded by further objectification or silencing. Affirmation is also an important part of Collins' call for self-definition, which can take place in the individual friendships and familial relationships of black women. Collins describes the process of self-definition as a \\"journey form internalized oppression to the 'free mind'\\" in order to emphasize its significance in the formation of the collective consciousness of black women. Reception  Media reception  With the success of Black Feminist Thought, Collins gained more recognition as a \\"social theorist, drawing from many intellectual traditions.\\" Collins' work has now been published and used in many different fields including philosophy, history, psychology and sociology. The University of Cincinnati named Collins The Charles Phelps Taft Professor of Sociology in 1996, making her the first ever African-American, and only the second woman, to hold this position. She received Emeritus status in the Spring of 2005, and became a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, College Park. The University of Maryland named Collins a Distinguished University Professor in 2006.\\" Black Feminist Thought is used in various university African American and Women Studies courses. Literary significance and reviews Black feminism remains important because U.S. Black women constitute an oppressed group. As a collectivity, U.S. Black women participate in a dialectical relationship linking African American women's oppression and activism. Dialectical relationships of this sort mean that two parties are opposed and opposite. As long as Black women's subordination within intersecting oppressions of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation persists, Black feminism as an activist response to that oppression will remain needed.Hill, Collins Patricia. Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment. New York: Routledge, 2000. Print. Editorial reviews \\"With the publication of Black Feminist Thought, black feminism has moved to a new level. Her work sets a standard for the discussion of black women's lives, experiences, and thought that demands rigorous attention to the complexity of these experiences and an exploration of a multiplicity of responses.\\" Black Feminist Thought provides a synthesis of a body of knowledge that is crucial to putting in perspective the situation of Black Women and their place in the overall struggle to reduce and eliminate gender, race, and class inequalities. The book provides an analysis of the ideas of Black Women, particularly those ideas that reflect a consciousness in opposition to oppression. Awards Black Feminist Thought won the Jessie Bernard Award of the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 1993 and the C. Wright Mills Award of The Society for the Study of Social Problems in 1990. According to the American Sociological Association, \\"The Jessie Bernard Award is given in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society. The contribution may be in empirical research, theory, or methodology. It is presented for significant cumulative work done throughout a professional career.\\" The Society for the Study of Social Problems \\"annually gives its C. Wright Mills Award to the author of what the committee considers to be the most outstanding book written in the tradition of C. Wright Mills and his dedication to a search for a sophisticated understanding of the individual and society.\\" References External links * A Conversation with Dr. Patricia Hill Collins * Link to American Sociological Association Website * Link to The Society for the Study of Social Problems Website * Women's Review of Books Category:1990 non-fiction books Category:Black feminist books Category:Literature by African-American women ","title":"Black Feminist Thought"},{"id":"37922872","text":"Deh Pirangan (), also rendered as Deh Birangan and Deh Parangan, may refer to: * Deh Pirangan-e Bala * Deh Pirangan-e Pain ","title":"Deh Pirangan"},{"id":"37922882","text":"Deh Gin (, also Romanized as Deh Gƒ´n) is a village in Mosaferabad Rural District, Rudkhaneh District, Rudan County, Hormozgan Province, Iran.

Hughes, 258 U.S. 126 (1922), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a general citizen, in a state that already had women's suffrage, lacked standing to challenge the validity of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment.. A companion case, Leser v. Garnett upheld the ratification. Background In 1919, the United States Congress proposed a Constitutional amendment reading: \\"Section 1: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\\" \\"Section 2: Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\\" By July 1920, thirty-five states had ratified the proposal, with only one additional state needed for the Amendment to be adopted. Charles S. Fairchild challenged the validity of what was to become the 19th Amendment. On July 7, 1920, Charles S. Fairchild challenged the validity of the ratification process for that Amendment in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. The challenge sought to prevent Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes from officially declaring the Amendment valid. The district court dismissed the case on July 20, and Fairchild appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. On August 26, Hughes acknowledged Tennessee's ratification, and the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution became law. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court decision. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. In November 1921, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, which was argued in January 1922. Opinion of the Court Louis Brandeis penned the Court's opinion. In February, the Court announced a unanimous decision authored by Associate Justice Louis Brandeis, concluding that Fairchild, as a private citizen, lacked standing to challenge the amendment's ratification under the limitations of the Case or Controversy Clause of Article III. On the same day, the Court also decided a companion case, Leser v. Garnett which upheld the Amendment's ratification process on the merits. The Fairchild decision marked a departure from prior doctrine, which had allowed any citizen to sue to preserve a public right.The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of Self-Governance, by Steven L. Winter, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 1371, July, 1988. Subsequent developments This case is often seen as one of two cases, along with Frothingham v. Mellon, that became the genesis of the doctrine of legal standing. However, the term standing was not associated with Article III until the New Deal era.

It was the 42nd edition of the bowl game. Through a sponsorship agreement announced in November, the bowl was officially known as the Mazda Gator Bowl. Teams Stanford Cardinal Under third-year head coach Jack Elway, Stanford was making its first bowl appearance since the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl. The Cardinal was led by running back Brad Muster, who was only the second Cardinal back to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season. Stanford's starting quarterback, John Paye, was sidelined for the game due to a shoulder injury and backup Greg Ennis was named the starter. Clemson Tigers The champions of the Atlantic Coast Conference, Clemson had recorded ties in its last two regular season games. Under head coach Danny Ford, the Tigers were led by tailbacks Kenny Flowers and Terrence Flagler. Game summary Clemson completely dominated the first half of the game, recording 291 yards of offense and 15 first downs, and scored touchdowns on runs from quarterback Rodney Williams and backs Chris Lancaster and Ray Williams. David Treadwell added two field goals to put the Tigers up 27‚Äì0 at halftime. Stanford recovered in the second half, holding the Tigers scoreless while gradually bringing the score closer. Muster scored on a one-yard run in the third quarter, and then twice more on fourth quarter passes from Ennis. The Cardinal had several chances to tie or win the game, but Ennis was intercepted inside the 10-yard line on one drive, and turned the ball over on downs with less than two minutes remaining.

Formal diplomatic relations were established at ambassador level in 2004, during the Thabo Mbeki government.\\"Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic - Joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations\\" A Sahrawi embassy was opened in Pretoria, and the South-African embassy in Algiers was accredited to the SADR. \\"Embassy of the Republic of South Africa in Algeria also accredited to the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic\\" South Africa continues to render political support and humanitarian assistance to the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic. Under the African Renaissance Fund (ARF) South Africa coordinates several projects that aim to benefit the Saharawi population. These include a contribution to a landmine clearance project in the east of the territory and construction of a sport development complex in the territory. Historical relations The relations between Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and South Africa, date back to the close bonds that were forged by the national liberation movements of both countries, namely the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa and the Polisario Front of Western Sahara shortly after the formation of the Polisario Front in 1973. It was in Algeria that the interaction between the ANC and the Polisario Front was solidified especially through the organisation's membership of bodies such as the Pan-African Youth Movement. On 22 July 1988 the then ANC President, Oliver Tambo led an ANC delegation to the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) at the invitation of President Mohamed Abdelaziz of SADR who is also Secretary General of the Polisario Front. In the course of the visit to the Liberated Territories in the SADR, the Polisario Front donated to the ANC and the South-West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) a substantial quantity of arms and ammunition captured from Moroccan troops. This gesture alone to the South African primary liberation movement signified the enduring bonds forged in difficult circumstances that the two countries and peoples share to this day. During this visit, Tambo said the following of his visit to SADR: \\"The warmth of the popular welcome from the Saharawi people is very different from all other welcomes we have received anywhere else in the world‚Ä¶We are also very surprised by the similarity of the nature of the struggle of the Sahrawi people and the people of South Africa. The visit to the SADR provided concrete confirmation of realities of which we are vaguely aware. One important thing we observed was the respect and support of the Saharawi people towards the struggle of the South African and Namibian people for national independence.\\" Diplomatic relations Shortly after the inauguration of the first South African post-apartheid government in 1994, the former South African President Nelson Mandela, announced a decision by the South African government of its intention to recognise and establish diplomatic relations with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic consistent with the earlier decisions of the OAU which South Africa formally joined in 1994. In June 1995, Nelson Mandela promised that links would be established, and this was subsequently confirmed by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and South Africa's OAU ambassador. However, the government delayed implementing its promise to recognise the Sahrawi Republic. On 15 September 2004, SADR and South Africa formally established diplomatic relations. On 16 September 2004, the former President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki declared that: \\"It is a matter of great shame and regret to all of us that (nevertheless) the issue of self-determination for the people of Western Sahara remains unresolved. This presents all of us with the challenge to ensure that we do everything possible to ensure that these sister people also enjoy this fundamental and inalienable right, whose defence by the entirety of our continent brought us our own freedom..\\" Following South Africa's pronouncement of the recognition of the SADR, the South African government declared that South Africa's recognition was not an end in itself but a means to an end: South Africa thus needs to remain seized with the issue of the illegal occupation of Western Sahara and in support for the Saharawi People's right to self-determination and decolonisation through a UN supervised referendum. The SADR opened an embassy in Pretoria in 2004. Ambassador Mohammed Beissat became the first SADR Ambassador to South Africa. In the same year the South African Ambassador to Algeria, Ambassador Ratubatsi Super Moloi became the first South African Ambassador to be accredited to the SADR. The freedom of Western Sahara remains a foreign policy priority for South Africa, especially in terms of the sanctity of colonial borders and the recognition of the Saharawi people's right to self-determination. On June 2013, South African and Sahrawi foreign ministers signed three memorandums of understanding, concerning cooperation, youth sport and demining issues. Chronology In July 2006, the South African Department of Foreign Affairs hosted the SADR Chief Spokesperson, Mohamed Khadad, and the Minister for International Co- operation, Mohammed Salem Ould Salek. The South African Department of Foreign Affairs facilitated and continued its humanitarian assistance funding for the SADR through the African Renaissance Fund (ARF). In November 2006, the South African Department of Foreign Affairs also co-hosted a human rights seminar on the situation in the illegally occupied territory of Western Sahara in co- operation with the South African Human Rights Commission. South African officials also participated in the 32nd annual European Conference for Co- ordinating Support for the Saharawi People, held in Spain. To strengthen international co-operation, South Africa attended the International Conference of Solidarity with the Saharawi People on the occasion of the commemoration of the 31st Anniversary of the SADR, held in Tifariti from 24 February to 1 March 2007. In September 2008, the South African Embassy to Algeria and SADR held Diplomatic Consultations with the SADR Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Ould Salek. From 28 September to 1 November 2008, the South African Department of Foreign Affairs coordinated a Diplomatic Training Programme for SADR Senior Officials. In October 2008, the South African Embassy to Algeria and SADR held Diplomatic Consultations with the SADR Minister of Culture Khadidja Hamdi. In December 2008, the South African Department of Foreign Affairs in partnership with the University of Pretoria co-hosted the International Conference on Multilateralism and International Law with Western Sahara as a Case Study in Pretoria, South Africa. In 2009 President Jacob Zuma in his yearly State of the Nation Address confirmed South Africa's principled position of support for the self-determination and decolonisation for the Western Sahara. In June 2013, South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane reaffirmed her country position on the decolonization and self-determination of the Saharawi people, stressing the need to urgently convene a referendum to allow Saharawis to choose their destiny.
