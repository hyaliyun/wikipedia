It is signed and dated at 1496. It is housed in the Uffizi of Florence. The panel was painted for the Convent of San Donato in Scopeto, in substitution of the one commissioned in 1481 to Leonardo da Vinci, who left it unfinished. In 1529 it was acquired by Cardinal Carlo de' Medici and in 1666 it became part of the Uffizi collection. Filippino Lippi followed Leonardo's setting, in particular in the central part of the work. Much of its inspiration was clearly derived from Botticelli's Adoration of the Magi, also in the Uffizi: this is evident in the disposition of the characters on the two sides, with the Holy Family portrayed in the centre under. Similarly to Botticelli's work, Filippino also portrayed numerous members of the Medici cadet line, who had adhered to the Savonarolian Republic in the period in which the work was executed. On the left, kneeling and holding with a quadrant, is Pierfrancesco de' Medici, who had died 20 years before. Behind him, standing, are his two sons Giovanni, holding a goblet, and Lorenzo, from whom a page is removing a crown. The general style is that of Filippino's late career, characterized by a greater care to details and by a nervous rhythm in the forms, influenced by the knowledge of foreign painting schools (as also in the landscape of the background).

It introduced an all-steel structure and replaced the wooden-framed Duple Vega, Viceroy and Vista models. Chassis Duple Dominant bodywork was built on different chassis types including: front engined *Albion Viking EVK55CL (export only) *Bedford SB *Bedford VAS *Ford R192, R226, R1014, R1114 *Leyland Cub (Dominant Bus only) *Mercedes-Benz LPO608 *Seddon Pennine 6 mid engined *AEC Reliance *Bedford YMQ, YRQ, YRT, YMT, YNT *Bristol LH *DAF MB200 *Dennis Lancet (Dominant Bus only) *Leyland Leopard *Leyland Tiger *Volvo B58 *Volvo B10M rear engined *Dennis Falcon H (Dominant Bus only) *Dennis Falcon V (Goldliner only) Variants The original Dominant had a windscreen (and matching rear windows) of the same height as the side windows. After 1976 it received a new design of grille and was known as the Dominant I. It remained in production throughout the Dominant's production life as a cheaper alternative to the Dominant II and because the deeper windscreens of the later Dominant marks were incompatible with some front-engined chassis. Some Dominant I bodies had Dominant II style rear windows, and/or headlights and front grilles. Special narrow bodies built for use on the Channel Islands retained the pre-1976 style grille until the end of production. The Dominant II (introduced in 1976) had a deeper windscreen, rectangular headlights, a different grille and a smaller, flat rear window. The Dominant III was designed to satisfy a Scottish Bus Group requirement for express coaches, and featured shallow, parallelogram-shaped flat double-glazed side windows similar to those on SBG's previous Alexander M-type coaches. Most Dominant IIIs featured a small Dominant I style windscreen mounted in the lower Dominant II position so as to allow a destination display to be included without breaking the roof line, but others had full-height Dominant II type windscreens. The small high-level windows were designed for SBG's overnight Scotland to London services where quietness was more important than passenger views, but nevertheless some other operators did buy the Dominant III as a touring coach. After being retired from long- distance services many SBG Dominant IIIs were rebuilt with larger Dominant I/II or Dominant IV windows to make them more suitable for general coaching work, and many were given replacement bodies later in life. The Dominant IV had slightly shallower side windows than those on the Dominant I and II, and these were available with flat glass as an option. Examples were built with all three varieties of windscreen size/position (Dominant I, Dominant II or hybrid Dominant III style). A few Dominant II/IV hybrids were built with stepped window lines, with larger Dominant I/II windows towards the front and shallower Dominant IV windows towards the rear. Many Dominant bodies were built to a dual-purpose specification featuring bus-type doors and other modifications to make them suitable for OMO (one-man operation) stage carriage services, and thus eligible for the British Government's \\"Bus Grant\\" which subsidised the cost of new service buses. These were known as the Dominant Express with the appropriate mark number where applicable (e.g. Dominant II Express). Some such bodies were actually furnished as service buses with low- backed bus seats, in which form the model was known as the Dominant E (again with mark number where applicable). The Dominant E was therefore a coach body fitted out as a bus and is not to be confused with the visually dissimilar Dominant Bus which was a purpose-designed bus body built in relatively small numbers from 1974 to 1987. This employed a similar structure to the coach bodies but with flat sides and small windows positioned lower on the body, amongst other differences. The Goldliner name was first used in 1975/76 for two non-standard one-off bodies based on the Dominant. The first was a high floor body on an early Bedford YMT built as a demonstrator, while the second was an export body with flat, double-glazed windows on a Volvo B58 chassis for Sweden. The name appeared again in 1982 for the Goldliner II, III and IV, which were high-floor versions of the Dominant II, III or IV. All had Dominant II style windscreens, and some coaches not fitted with destination or operator name displays above the windscreen had a stepped roofline behind the cab. As with the Dominant III, many Goldliner IIIs were subsequently rebuilt with larger single-glazed windows or rebodied. Replacement In 1983 the new Duple Laser and high-floor Caribbean were launched as replacements for the full-sized Dominant coach variants and the Goldliner respectively. The last handful of full-sized Dominant coaches were built for the 1984 season. Due to the small volume of sales it was not worth engineering the Laser for the smaller front-engined Bedford SB and VAS chassis, so Dominant coaches on these chassis continued to be built until 1985. The Dominant Bus remained in production until 1987 when it was replaced by the Duple 300.

Absinthe traditionally has a natural green color but may also be colorless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as ' (\\"the green fairy\\"). It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, but is not traditionally bottled with added sugar and is, therefore, classified as a spirit.'Traite de la Fabrication de Liqueurs et de la Distillation des Alcools' Duplais (1882 3rd Ed, p. 249) Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed. Absinthe originated in the canton of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. The consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists, partly due to its association with bohemian culture. From Europe and the Americas, notable absinthe drinkers included Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Byron and Alfred Jarry., Sarasota Herald- Tribune, September 18, 2008, SAMA Network, November 25, 1988 Absinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, which is present in the spirit in trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria‚ÄìHungary, yet it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties have been exaggerated, apart from that of the alcohol. A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed long-standing barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and the Czech Republic. Etymology The French word absinthe can refer either to the alcoholic beverage or, less commonly, to the actual wormwood plant. Absinthe is derived from the Latin absinthium, which in turn comes from the Greek aps√≠nthion, \\"wormwood\\".. The use of Artemisia absinthium in a drink is attested in Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (I 936‚Äì950), where Lucretius indicates that a drink containing wormwood is given as medicine to children in a cup with honey on the brim to make it drinkable. Some claim that the word means \\"undrinkable\\" in Greek, but it may instead be linked to the Persian root spand or aspand, or the variant esfand, which meant Peganum harmala, also called Syrian Rue‚Äîalthough it is not actually a variety of rue, another famously bitter herb. That Artemisia absinthium was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language root *spend, meaning \\"to perform a ritual\\" or \\"make an offering\\". Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or from a common ancestor of both, is unclear. Alternatively, the Greek word may originate in a pre-Greek substrate word, marked by the non- Indo-European consonant complex ŒΩŒ∏ (-nth). Alternative spellings for absinthe include absinth, absynthe and absenta. Absinth (without the final e) is a spelling variant most commonly applied to absinthes produced in central and eastern Europe, and is specifically associated with Bohemian-style absinthes. History Henri Privat-Livemont's 1896 poster The precise origin of absinthe is unclear. The medical use of wormwood dates back to ancient Egypt and is mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus, c. 1550 BC. Wormwood extracts and wine-soaked wormwood leaves were used as remedies by the ancient Greeks. Moreover, there is evidence of a wormwood-flavoured wine in ancient Greece called absinthites oinos. The first evidence of absinthe, in the sense of a distilled spirit containing green anise and fennel, dates to the 18th century. According to popular legend, it began as an all-purpose patent remedy created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in Couvet, Switzerland around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold it as a medicinal elixir. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, a certain Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters in 1797 and opened the first absinthe distillery named Dubied P√®re et Fils in Couvet with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod. In 1805, they built a second distillery in Pontarlier, France, under the company name Maison Pernod Fils.Absinthe FAQ III Retrieved Aug. 20, 2014. Pernod Fils remained one of the most popular brands of absinthe until the drink was banned in France in 1914. =Growth of consumption= An advertising poster for Absinthe Beucler Absinthe's popularity grew steadily through the 1840s, when it was given to French troops as a malaria preventive, and the troops brought home their taste for it. Absinthe became so popular in bars, bistros, caf√©s, and cabarets by the 1860s that the hour of 5 p.m. was called l'heure verte (\\"the green hour\\"). It was favoured by all social classes, from the wealthy bourgeoisie to poor artists and ordinary working-class people. By the 1880s, mass production had caused the price to drop sharply, and the French were drinking 36 million litres per year by 1910, compared to their annual consumption of almost 5 billion litres of wine. Absinthe was exported widely from France and Switzerland and attained some degree of popularity in other countries, including Spain, Great Britain, United States, and the Czech Republic. It was never banned in Spain or Portugal, and its production and consumption have never ceased. It gained a temporary spike in popularity there during the early 20th century, corresponding with the Art Nouveau and Modernism aesthetic movements. New Orleans has a cultural association with absinthe and is credited as the birthplace of the Sazerac, perhaps the earliest absinthe cocktail. The Old Absinthe House bar on Bourbon Street began selling absinthe in the first half of the 19th century. Its Catalan lease-holder, Cayetano Ferrer, named it the Absinthe Room in 1874 due to of the popularity of the drink, which was served in the Parisian style. It was frequented by Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Aleister Crowley, and Frank Sinatra. =Bans= Absinthe became associated with violent crimes and social disorder, and one modern writer claims that this trend was spurred by fabricated claims and smear campaigns, which he claims were orchestrated by the temperance movement and the wine industry. One critic claimed: √âdouard Manet's first major painting The Absinthe Drinker was controversial, and was rejected by the Paris Salon in 1859. √âdouard Manet, The Absinthe Drinker, c.1859 L'Absinthe, by Edgar Degas, 1876 Edgar Degas's 1876 painting L'Absinthe can be seen at the Mus√©e d'Orsay epitomising the popular view of absinthe addicts as sodden and benumbed, and √âmile Zola described its effects in his novel L'Assommoir.1970 Penguin Classics English edition. p. 411 Swiss farmer Jean Lanfray murdered his family in 1905 and attempted to take his own life after drinking absinthe. Lanfray was an alcoholic who had consumed considerable quantities of wine and brandy before drinking two glasses of absinthe, but that was overlooked or ignored, placing the blame for the murders solely on absinthe.Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. pp. 1‚Äì4 The Lanfray murders were the tipping point in this hotly debated topic, and a subsequent petition collected more than 82,000 signatures to ban it in Switzerland. A referendum was held on 5 July 1908.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P. (2010) Elections in Europe: A Data Dandbook, p. 1906 It was approved by voters, and the prohibition of absinthe was written into the Swiss constitution. In 1906, Belgium and Brazil banned the sale and distribution of absinthe, although these were not the first countries to take such action. It had been banned as early as 1898 in the colony of the Congo Free State. The Netherlands banned it in 1909, Switzerland in 1910,United States Brewers' Association. The 1916 Year Book of the United States Brewers' Association. Published 1916. morning p. 82 (Google Books link). the United States in 1912, and France in 1914. The prohibition of absinthe in France would eventually lead to the popularity of pastis, and to a lesser extent, ouzo, and other anise-flavoured spirits that do not contain wormwood. Following the conclusion of the First World War, production of the Pernod Fils brand was resumed at the Banus distillery in Catalonia, Spain (where absinthe was still legal),The Absinthe Buyer's Guide ‚ÄîLa F√©e Verte\\"Absinthe S.A. Pernod Tarragona\\". Retrieved on 2009-02-24 but gradually declining sales saw the cessation of production in the 1960s. In Switzerland, the ban served only to drive the production of absinthe underground. Clandestine home distillers produced colourless absinthe (la Bleue), which was easier to conceal from the authorities. Many countries never banned absinthe, notably Britain, where it had never been as popular as in continental Europe. =Modern revival= British importer BBH Spirits began to import Hill's Absinth from the Czech Republic in the 1990s, as the UK had never formally banned it, and this sparked a modern resurgence in its popularity. It began to reappear during a revival in the 1990s in countries where it was never banned. Forms of absinthe available during that time consisted almost exclusively of Czech, Spanish, and Portuguese brands that were of recent origin, typically consisting of Bohemian-style products. Connoisseurs considered these of inferior quality and not representative of the 19th century spirit. In 2000, La F√©e Absinthe became the first commercial absinthe distilled and bottled in France since the 1914 ban,The Dedalus Book of Absinthe, Baker, Phil (2001, p. 165, )\\"Absinthe Tale\\", Difford, Simmon, Class Magazine (May/June 2009, pp. 88-93). but it is now one of dozens of brands that are produced and sold within France. Modern absinthes. Vertes at left; blanches at right. A prepared glass is in front of each. In the Netherlands, the restrictions were challenged by Amsterdam wineseller Menno Boorsma in July 2004, thus confirming the legality of absinthe once again. Similarly, Belgium lifted its long-standing ban on January 1, 2005, citing a conflict with the adopted food and beverage regulations of the Single European Market. In Switzerland, the constitutional ban was repealed in 2000 during an overhaul of the national constitution, although the prohibition was written into ordinary law instead. That law was later repealed and it was made legal on March 1, 2005. The drink was never officially banned in Spain, although it began to fall out of favour in the 1940s and almost vanished into obscurity. Catalonia has seen significant resurgence since 2007 when one producer established operations there. Absinthe has never been illegal to import or manufacture in Australia, although importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing \\"oil of wormwood\\".Schedule 8 Commonwealth of Australia Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956, Schedule 8.

However, this amendment was found inconsistent with other parts of the preexisting Food Code, and it was withdrawn in 2002 during the transition between the two codes, thereby continuing to allow absinthe manufacture and importation through the existing permit-based system.

In December 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte produced by St. George Spirits of Alameda, California became the first brand of American-made absinthe produced in the United States since the ban.Stacy Finz, \\"Alameda distiller helps make absinthe legitimate again\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 5 December 2007Pete Wells, \\"A Liquor of Legend Makes a Comeback\\", The New York Times, 5 December 2007 Since that time, other micro-distilleries have started producing small batches in the US.

Production Green anise, one of three main herbs used in the production of absinthe Grande wormwood, one of three main herbs used in production of absinthe Sweet fennel, one of three main herbs used in production of absinthe Most countries have no legal definition for absinthe, whereas the method of production and content of spirits such as whisky, brandy, and gin are globally defined and regulated. Therefore, producers are at liberty to label a product as \\"absinthe\\" or \\"absinth\\" without regard to any specific legal definition or quality standards. Producers of legitimate absinthes employ one of two historically defined processes to create the finished spirit: distillation, or cold mixing. In the sole country (Switzerland) that does possess a legal definition of absinthe, distillation is the only permitted method of production. =Distilled absinthe= Distilled absinthe employs a method of production similar to that of high quality gin. Botanicals are initially macerated in distilled base alcohol before being redistilled to exclude bitter principles, and impart the desired complexity and texture to the spirit. Absinthe distillation, ca. 1904 The distillation of absinthe first yields a colourless distillate that leaves the alembic at around 72% ABV. The distillate may be reduced and bottled clear, to produce a Blanche or la Bleue absinthe, or it may be coloured to create a verte using natural or artificial colouring. Traditional absinthes obtain their green color strictly from the chlorophyll of whole herbs, which is extracted from the plants during the secondary maceration. This step involves steeping plants such as petite wormwood, hyssop, and melissa (among other herbs) in the distillate. Chlorophyll from these herbs is extracted in the process, giving the drink its famous green color. This step also provides a herbal complexity that is typical of high quality absinthe. The natural colouring process is considered critical for absinthe ageing, since the chlorophyll remains chemically active. The chlorophyll serves a similar role in absinthe that tannins do in wine or brown liquors. After the colouring process, the resulting product is diluted with water to the desired percentage of alcohol. The flavour of absinthe is said to improve materially with storage, and many pre-ban distilleries aged their absinthe in settling tanks before bottling. =Cold mixed absinthe= Many modern absinthes are produced using a cold mix process. This inexpensive method of production does not involve distillation, and is regarded as inferior in the same way that cheaper compound gin is regarded as inferior to distilled gin. The cold mixing process involves the simple blending of flavouring essences and artificial colouring in commercial alcohol, in similar fashion to most flavoured vodkas and inexpensive liqueurs and cordials. Some modern cold mixed absinthes have been bottled at strengths approaching 90% ABV. Others are presented simply as a bottle of plain alcohol with a small amount of powdered herbs suspended within it. The lack of a formal legal definition for absinthe in most countries enables some cold mixing producers to falsify advertising claims, such as referring to their products as \\"distilled\\", since the base alcohol itself was created at some point through distillation. This is used as justification to sell these inexpensively produced absinthes at prices comparable to more authentic absinthes that are distilled directly from whole herbs. In the only country that possesses a formal legal definition of absinthe (Switzerland), anything made via the cold mixed process cannot be sold as absinthe. =Ingredients= Anise seeds Absinthe is traditionally prepared from a distillation of neutral alcohol, various herbs, spices and water. Traditional absinthes were redistilled from a white grape spirit (or eau de vie), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes.\\"La Maison Pernod Fils a Pontarlier\\", E. Dentu (1896, p. 10) The principal botanicals are grande wormwood, green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called \\"the holy trinity\\". Many other herbs may be used as well, such as petite wormwood (Artemisia pontica or Roman wormwood), hyssop, melissa, star anise, angelica, peppermint, coriander, and veronica. One early recipe was included in 1864's The English and Australian Cookery Book. It directed the maker to \\"Take of the tops of wormwood, four pounds; root of angelica, calamus aromaticus, aniseed, leaves of dittany, of each one ounce; alcohol, four gallons. Macerate these substances during eight days, add a little water, and distil by a gentle fire, until two gallons are obtained. This is reduced to a proof spirit, and a few drops of the oil of aniseed added.\\" =Alternative colouring= Adding to absinthe's negative reputation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, unscrupulous makers of the drink omitted the traditional coloring phase of production in favour of adding toxic copper salts to artificially induce a green tint. This practice may be responsible for some of the alleged toxicity historically associated with this beverage. Many modern-day producers resort to similar (but non-deadly) shortcuts, including the use of artificial food coloring to create the green color. Additionally, at least some cheap absinthes produced before the ban were reportedly adulterated with poisonous antimony trichloride, reputed to enhance the louching effect. Absinthe may also be naturally coloured pink or red using rose or hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a rose (pink) or rouge (red) absinthe. Only one historical brand of rose absinthe has been documented. =Bottled strength= Absinthe was historically bottled at 45‚Äì74% ABV. Some modern Franco‚ÄìSuisse absinthes are bottled at up to 83% ABV, while some modern, cold-mixed bohemian-style absinthes are bottled at up to 90% ABV. =Kits= The modern day interest in absinthe has spawned a rash of absinthe kits from companies that claim they produce homemade absinthe. Kits often call for soaking herbs in vodka or alcohol, or adding a liquid concentrate to vodka or alcohol to create an ersatz absinthe. Such practices usually yield a harsh substance that bears little resemblance to the genuine article, and are considered inauthentic by any practical standard. Some concoctions may even be dangerous, especially if they call for supplementation with potentially poisonous herbs, oils and/or extracts. In at least one documented case, a person suffered acute kidney injury after drinking 10 ml of pure wormwood oil‚Äîa dose much higher than that found in absinthe.Evolution in Action! Gumbo Pages. Dangers of drinking wormwood extract. Retrieved 26 August 2007. =Alternatives= In baking, Pernod Anise is often used as a substitute if absinthe is unavailable. In preparing the classic New Orleans-style Sazerac cocktail, various substitutes such as Pastis, Pernod, Ricard, and Herbsaint have been used to replace absinthe. Preparation Preparing absinthe using the traditional method, which does not involve burning. Absinthe spoons are designed to perch a sugar cube atop the glass, over which ice-cold water is dripped to dilute the absinthe. The lip near the centre of the handle lets the spoon rest securely on the rim of the glass. The traditional French preparation involves placing a sugar cube on top of a specially designed slotted spoon, and placing the spoon on a glass filled with a measure of absinthe. Iced water is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3‚Äì5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the louche (Fr. opaque or shady, IPA [lu É]). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that \\"blossom\\" or \\"bloom,\\" and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and is often referred to as the French Method. The Bohemian Method is a recent invention that involves fire, and was not performed during absinthe's peak of popularity in the Belle √âpoque. Like the French method, a sugar cube is placed on a slotted spoon over a glass containing one shot of absinthe. The sugar is pre-soaked in alcohol (usually more absinthe), then set ablaze. The flaming sugar cube is then dropped into the glass, thus igniting the absinthe. Finally, a shot glass of water is added to douse the flames. This method tends to produce a stronger drink than the French method. A variant of the Bohemian Method involves allowing the fire to extinguish on its own. This variant is sometimes referred to as \\"Cooking the Absinthe\\" or \\"the Flaming Green Fairy\\". The origin of this burning ritual may borrow from a coffee and brandy drink that was served at Caf√© Br√ªlot, in which a sugar cube soaked in brandy was set aflame. Most experienced absintheurs do not recommend the Bohemian Method and consider it a modern gimmick, as it can destroy the absinthe flavour and present a fire hazard due to the unusually high alcohol content present in absinthe. Slowly dripping ice water from an absinthe fountain Burning the sugar In 19th century Parisian caf√©s, upon receiving an order for an absinthe, a waiter would present the patron with a dose of absinthe in a suitable glass, sugar, absinthe spoon, and a carafe of iced water. It was up to the patron to prepare the drink, as the inclusion or omission of sugar was strictly an individual preference, as was the amount of water used. As the popularity of the drink increased, additional accoutrements of preparation appeared, including the absinthe fountain, which was effectively a large jar of iced water with spigots, mounted on a lamp base. This let drinkers prepare a number of drinks at once‚Äîand with a hands-free drip, patrons could socialise while louching a glass. Although many bars served absinthe in standard glassware, a number of glasses were specifically designed for the French absinthe preparation ritual. Absinthe glasses were typically fashioned with a dose line, bulge, or bubble in the lower portion denoting how much absinthe should be poured. One \\"dose\\" of absinthe ranged anywhere around 2-2.5 fluid ounces (60‚Äì75 ml). In addition to being prepared with sugar and water, absinthe emerged as a popular cocktail ingredient in both the United Kingdom and the United States. By 1930, dozens of fancy cocktails that called for absinthe had been published in numerous credible bartender guides. One of the most famous of these libations is Ernest Hemingway's \\"Death in the Afternoon\\" cocktail, a tongue-in-cheek concoction that contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. The directions are as follows: \\"Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.\\" Styles The Absinthe Drinker by Viktor Oliva (1861‚Äì1928) The Drinkers by Jean B√©raud (1908) Most categorical alcoholic beverages have regulations governing their classification and labelling, while those governing absinthe have always been conspicuously lacking. According to popular treatises from the 19th century, absinthe could be loosely categorised into several grades (ordinaire, demi-fine, fine, and Suisse‚Äîthe latter does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and quality. Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker. * Blanche absinthe (\\"white\\" in French, also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and reduction, and is uncoloured (clear). The name la Bleue was originally a term used for Swiss bootleg absinthe (which was bottled colourless so as to be visually indistinct from other spirits during the era of absinthe prohibition), but has become a popular term for post-ban Swiss- style absinthe in general. Blanches are often lower in alcohol content than vertes, though this is not necessarily so; the only truly differentiating factor is that blanches are not put through a secondary maceration stage, and thus remain colourless like other distilled liquors. * Verte absinthe (\\"green\\" in French, sometimes called la f√©e verte) begins as a blanche. The blanche is altered by a secondary maceration stage, in which a separate mixture of herbs is steeped into the clear distillate. This confers a peridot green hue and an intense flavor. Vertes represent the prevailing type of absinthe that was found in the 19th century. Vertes are typically more alcoholic than blanches, as the high amounts of botanical oils conferred during the secondary maceration only remain miscible at lower concentrations of water, thus vertes are usually bottled at closer to still strength. Artificially colored green absinthes may also be claimed to be verte, though they lack the characteristic herbal flavors that result from maceration in whole herbs. * Absenta (\\"absinthe\\" in Spanish) is sometimes associated with a regional style that often differed slightly from its French cousin. Traditional absentas may taste slightly different due to their use of Alicante anise, and often exhibit a characteristic citrus flavour. * Hausgemacht (German for home-made, often abbreviated as HG) refers to clandestine absinthe (not be confused with the Swiss La Clandestine brand) that is home-distilled by hobbyists. It should not be confused with absinthe kits. Hausgemacht absinthe is produced in tiny quantities for personal use and not for the commercial market. Clandestine production increased after absinthe was banned, when small producers went underground, most notably in Switzerland. Although the ban has been lifted in Switzerland, some clandestine distillers have not legitimised their production. Authorities believe that high taxes on alcohol and the mystique of being underground are likely reasons. * Bohemian-style absinth is also referred to as Czech-style absinthe, anise-free absinthe, or just \\"absinth\\" (without the \\"e\\"), and is best described as a wormwood bitters. It is produced mainly in Czechia, from which it gets its designation as Bohemian or Czech, although not all absinthes from Czechia are Bohemian-style. Bohemian-style absinth typically contains little or none of the anise, fennel, and other herbal flavours associated with traditional absinthe, and thus bears very little resemblance to the absinthes made popular in the 19th century. Typical Bohemian-style absinth has only two similarities with its authentic, traditional counterpart: it contains wormwood and has a high alcohol content. The Czechs are credited with inventing the fire ritual in the 1990s, possibly because Bohemian-style absinth does not louche, which renders the traditional French preparation method useless. As such, this type of absinthe and the fire ritual associated with it are entirely modern fabrications, and have little to no relationship with the historical absinthe tradition. Storage Absinthe that is artificially coloured or clear is aesthetically stable, and can be bottled in clear glass. If naturally colored absinthe is exposed to light or air for a prolonged period, the chlorophyll gradually becomes oxidized, which has the effect of gradually changing the color from green to yellow green, and eventually to brown. The colour of absinthe that has completed this transition was historically referred to as feuille morte (\\"dead leaf\\"). In the pre-ban era, this natural phenomenon was favourably viewed, for it confirmed the product in question was coloured naturally, and not artificially with potentially toxic chemicals. Predictably, vintage absinthes often emerge from sealed bottles as distinctly amber in tint due to decades of slow oxidation. Though this colour change presents no adverse impact to the flavour of absinthe, it is generally desired to preserve the original colour, which requires that naturally coloured absinthe be bottled in dark, light resistant bottles. Absinthe intended for decades of storage should be kept in a cool (room temperature), dry place, away from light and heat. Absinthe should not be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, as the anethole may polymerise inside the bottle, creating an irreversible precipitate, and adversely impacting the original flavour.  Health effects  Absinthe has been frequently and improperly described in modern times as being hallucinogenic. No peer-reviewed scientific study has demonstrated absinthe to possess hallucinogenic properties. The belief that absinthe induces hallucinogenic effects is at least partly rooted in that, following ten years of experiments with wormwood oil in the 19th century, the French psychiatrist Valentin Magnan studied 250 cases of alcoholism, and claimed that those who drank absinthe were worse off than those drinking ordinary alcohol, having experienced rapid- onset hallucinations.The Lancet 1874, \\"On the Comparative Action of Alcohol and Absinthe\\" By Dr. Magnan Retrieved 29 November 2006 Such accounts by opponents of absinthe (like Magnan) were cheerfully embraced by famous absinthe drinkers, many of whom were bohemian artists or writers.Salleh, Anna. Absinthe's Mystique Cops a Blow, ABC Science, May 1, 2008. Two famous artists who helped popularise the notion that absinthe had powerful psychoactive properties were Toulouse-Lautrec and Vincent van Gogh. In one of the best- known written accounts of absinthe drinking, an inebriated Oscar Wilde described a phantom sensation of having tulips brush against his legs after leaving a bar at closing time.Baker, Phil; (2001). The Book of Absinthe: A Cultural History\\". Grove Press books. p. 32 Notions of absinthe's alleged hallucinogenic properties were again fuelled in the 1970s, when a scientific paper suggested that thujone's structural similarity to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical in cannabis, presented the possibility of THC receptor affinity.Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle Books. p. 152 This theory was conclusively disproven in 1999. The debate over whether absinthe produces effects on the human mind in addition to those of alcohol has not been resolved conclusively. The effects of absinthe have been described by some as mind opening. The most commonly reported experience is a \\"clear-headed\\" feeling of inebriation‚Äîa form of \\"lucid drunkenness\\". Chemist, historian and absinthe distiller Ted Breaux has claimed that the alleged secondary effects of absinthe may be because some of the herbal compounds in the drink act as stimulants, while others act as sedatives, creating an overall lucid effect of awakening. The long-term effects of moderate absinthe consumption in humans remain unknown, although herbs traditionally used to produce absinthe are reported to have both painkillingK.C. Rice and R.S.

Citing Absinthe: History in a Bottle, Biomed Central, The Book of Absinthe, and Thujone.info It is widely accepted that reports of hallucinogenic effects of absinthe were attributable to the poisonous adulterants being added to cheaper versions of the drink in the 19th century,Ian Hutton: \\"Myth, Reality and Absinthe\\", Current Drug Discovery, 2002, 9, p. 63 \\"Common adulterants were cupric acetate (to provide the valued green color)\\" such as oil of wormwood, impure alcohol, and poisonous colouring matter (e.g. copper salts).[\\"The Effects of Absinthe\\"; Emma S. Walker, M.D., Medical Record 1906] \\"...the alcohol employed in this liquor is frequently very impure...the bitter principle of absinthium, absinthin (from oil of wormwood), is a narcotic poison...not infrequently copper salts have been used in order to produce the green color.\\"[The Mixicologist; C.F. Lawler, 1895] \\"The distillers of Bensa√ßon, Pontarlier, and Couvet hit on the idea of distilling the Absinthe herb (wormwood), adding annis [sic], fennel, and coriander seeds, etc., ad lib., these making an agreeable beverage. Absinthe so made soon had considerable success, which had the usual effect of bringing out the injurious trash made from oils, essences, etc. \\" = Controversy = It was once widely promoted that excessive absinthe drinking caused effects that were discernible from those associated with alcoholism, a belief that led to the coining of the term absinthism. One of the first vilifications of absinthe followed an 1864 experiment in which Magnan simultaneously exposed one guinea pig to large doses of pure wormwood vapour, and another to alcohol vapours. The guinea pig exposed to wormwood vapour experienced convulsive seizures, while the animal exposed to alcohol did not. Magnan would later blame the naturally occurring (in wormwood) chemical thujone for these effects.Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe: History in a Bottle. Chronicle Books. p. 101 Thujone, once widely believed to be an active chemical in absinthe, is a GABA antagonist, and while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses, there is no direct evidence to suggest it causes hallucinations. Past reports estimated thujone concentrations in absinthe as being up to 260 mg/kg.Ian Hutton, p. 62, \\"quoted by Arnold\\"...\\"Arnold WN (1989) Absinthe: Scientific American 260(6):112‚Äì117\\" More recently, published scientific analyses of samples of various original absinthes have disproved previous estimates, and demonstrated that only a trace of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe when historical methods and materials are employed to create the spirit. As such, most traditionally crafted absinthes, both vintage and modern, fall within the current EU standards.Ian Hutton, pp. 62‚Äì63Determination of a/Œ≤ Thujone and Related Terpenes in Absinthe using Solid Phase Extraction and Gas Chromatography. Retrieved 5 March 2006. Tests conducted on mice to study toxicity showed an oral of about 45 mg thujone per kg of body weight, which represents far more absinthe than could be realistically consumed. The high percentage of alcohol in absinthe would result in mortality long before thujone could become a factor. In documented cases of acute thujone poisoning as a result of oral ingestion, the source of thujone was not commercial absinthe, but rather non-absinthe-related sources, such as common essential oils (which may contain as much as 50% thujone).Essential oils from Dalmatian Sage. J. Agric. Food Chem 29 April 1999. Retrieved 12 May 2006. One study published in the Journal of Studies on AlcoholAbsinthe: Attention Performance and Mood under the Influence of Thujone Journal of Studies on Alcohol, DETTLING, A. et al. Retrieved 2 December 2016. concluded that high doses (0.28 mg/kg) of thujone in alcohol had negative effects on attention performance in a clinical setting. It delayed reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention into the central field of vision. Low doses (0.028 mg/kg) did not produce an effect noticeably different from the plain alcohol control. While the effects of the high dose samples were statistically significant in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples contained thujone. For the average man, the high dose samples in the study would equate to 18.2 mg of thujone. The EU limit of 35 mg/L of thujone in absinthe means that given the highest permitted thujone content, that individual would need to consume approximately 0.5 litres of high proof (e.g. 50%+ ABV) spirit before the thujone could be metabolized in order to display effects detectable in a clinical setting, which would result in a potentially lethal BAC of >0.4%. Regulations Most countries (except Switzerland) at present do not possess a legal definition of absinthe (unlike Scotch whisky or cognac). Accordingly, producers are free to label a product \\"absinthe\\" or \\"absinth\\", whether or not it bears any resemblance to the traditional spirit. =Australia= Absinthe is readily available in many bottle shops.

Retrieved 1 December 2016. The domestic production and sale of absinthe is regulated by state licensing laws. Until July 13, 2013, the import and sale of absinthe technically required a special permit, since \\"oil of wormwood, being an essential oil obtained from plants of the genus Artemisia, and preparations containing oil of wormwood\\" were listed as item 12A, Schedule 8, Regulation 5H of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (Cth). These controls have now been repealed, and permission is no longer required. =Brazil= Absinthe was prohibited in Brazil until 1999 and was brought by entrepreneur Lalo Zanini and legalised in the same year. Presently, absinthe sold in Brazil must abide by the national law that restricts all spirits to a maximum of 54% ABV. While this regulation is enforced throughout channels of legal distribution, it may be possible to find absinthe containing alcohol in excess of the legal limit in some restaurants or food fairs. =Canada= In Canada, liquor laws concerning the production, distribution, and sale of spirits are written and enforced by individual provincial government monopolies. Each product is subject to the approval of a respective individual provincial liquor board before it can be sold in that province. Importation is a federal matter, and is enforced by the Canada Border Services Agency. The importation of a nominal amount of liquor by individuals for personal use is permitted, provided that conditions for the individual's duration of stay outside the country are satisfied. * British Columbia, New Brunswick: no established limits on thujone content * Alberta, Ontario: 10 mg/kg * Manitoba: 6‚Äì8 mg * Quebec: 15 mg/kg * Newfoundland and Labrador: absinthe sold in provincial liquor store outlets * Nova Scotia: absinthe sold in provincial liquor store outlets * Prince Edward Island: absinthe is not sold in provincial liquor store outlets, but one brand (Deep Roots) produced on the island can be procured locally. * Saskatchewan: Only one brand listed in provincial liquor stores, although an individual is permitted to import one case (usually twelve 750 ml bottles or eight one-litre bottles) of any liquor. * Ontario: 3 brands of absinthe are listed for sale on the web site of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario In 2007, Canada's first genuine absinthe (Taboo Absinthe) was created by Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery in British Columbia. =European Union= The European Union permits a maximum thujone level of 35 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages where Artemisia species is a listed ingredient, and 10 mg/kg in other alcoholic beverages.Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 2008, European Commission. Member countries regulate absinthe production within this framework. The sale of absinthe is permitted in all EU countries unless they further regulate it. =Finland= The sale and production of absinthe was prohibited in Finland from 1919 to 1932; no current prohibitions exist. The government-owned chain of liquor stores (Alko) is the only outlet that may sell alcoholic beverages containing over 5.5% ABV, although national law bans the sale of alcoholic beverages containing over 60% ABV. =France= Pablo Picasso, 1901‚Äì02, Femme au caf√© (Absinthe Drinker), oil on canvas, , Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia Despite adopting sweeping EU food and beverage regulations in 1988 that effectively re-legalised absinthe, a decree was passed that same year that preserved the prohibition on products explicitly labelled as \\"absinthe\\", while placing strict limits on fenchone (fennel) and pinocamphone (hyssop)D√©cret n¬∞88‚Äì1024 du 2 novembre 1988. Retrieved 5 March 2006. in an obvious, but failed, attempt to thwart a possible return of absinthe-like products. French producers circumvented this regulatory obstacle by labelling absinthe as spiritueux √† base de plantes d'absinthe ('wormwood-based spirits'), with many either reducing or omitting fennel and hyssop altogether from their products. A legal challenge to the scientific basis of this decree resulted in its repeal (2009), which opened the door for the official French re-legalisation of absinthe for the first time since 1915. The French Senate voted to repeal the prohibition in mid-April 2011. =Georgia= It is legal to produce and sell absinthe in Georgia, which has claimed to possess several producers of absinthe. =Germany= A ban on absinthe was enacted in Germany on 27 March 1923. In addition to banning the production of and commercial trade in absinthe, the law went so far as to prohibit the distribution of printed matter that provided details of its production. The original ban was lifted in 1981, but the use of Artemisia absinthium as a flavouring agent remained prohibited. On 27 September 1991, Germany adopted the European Union's standards of 1988, which effectively re-legalised absinthe. =Italy= The Fascist regime in 1926 banned the production, import, transport and sale of any liquor named \\"Assenzio\\". The ban was reinforced in 1931 with harsher penalties for transgressors, and remained in force until 1992 when the Italian government amended its laws to comply with the EU directive 88/388/EEC. =New Zealand= Although absinthe is not prohibited at national level, some local authorities have banned it. The latest is Mataura in Southland. The ban came in August 2008 after several issues of misuse drew public and police attention. One incident resulted in breathing difficulties and hospitalising of a 17-year-old for alcohol poisoning. The particular brand of absinthe that caused these effects was bottled at 89% ABV. =Sweden and Norway= The sale and production of absinthe has never been prohibited in Sweden or Norway. However, the only outlet that may sell alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.5% ABV in Sweden and 4.75% ABV in Norway, is the government-owned chain of liquor stores known as Systembolaget in Sweden and Vinmonopolet in Norway. Systembolaget and Vinmonopolet did not import or sell absinthe for many years after the ban in France; however, today several absinthes are available for purchase in Systembolaget stores, including Swedish made distilled absinthe. In Norway, on the other hand, one is less likely to find many absinthes since Norwegian alcohol law prohibits the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages above 60% ABV, which eliminates most absinthes. =Switzerland= La fin de la f√©e verte (\\"The End of the Green Fairy\\"): Swiss poster criticizing the country's prohibition of absinthe in 1910 In Switzerland, the sale and production of absinthe was prohibited from 1910 to March 1, 2005. This was based on a vote in 1908. To be legally made or sold in Switzerland, absinthe must be distilled, must not contain certain additives, and must be either naturally coloured or left uncoloured. In 2014, the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland invalidated a governmental decision of 2010 which allowed only absinthe made in the Val-de-Travers region to be labelled as absinthe in Switzerland. The court found that absinthe was a label for a product and was not tied to a geographic origin. =United States= In 2007, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) effectively lifted the long-standing absinthe ban, and it has since approved many brands for sale in the US market. This was made possible partly through the TTB's clarification of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) thujone content regulations, which specify that finished food and beverages that contain Artemisia species must be thujone-free. In this context, the TTB considers a product thujone-free if the thujone content is less than 10 ppm (equal to 10 mg/kg). This is verified through the use of gas chromatography- mass spectrometry. The brands K√ºbler and Lucid and their lawyers did most of the work to get absinthe legalized in the U.S., over the 2004-2007 time period. In the U.S., March 5 sometimes is referred to as \\"National Absinthe Day\\", as it was the day the 95-year ban on absinthe was finally lifted.V. Navarro \\"It's National Absinthe Day!\\" \\"LA Speakeasy\\", March 5, 2018 The import, distribution, and sale of absinthe are permitted subject to the following restrictions: * The product must be thujone-free as per TTB guidelines, * The word \\"absinthe\\" can neither be the brand name nor stand alone on the label, and * The packaging cannot \\"project images of hallucinogenic, psychotropic, or mind-altering effects.\\" Absinthe imported in violation of these regulations is subject to seizure at the discretion of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Beginning in 2000, a product called Absente was sold legally in the United States under the marketing tagline \\"Absinthe Refined,\\" but as the product contained sugar, and was made with southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum) and not grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) (before 2009), the TTB classified it as a liqueur. =Vanuatu= The Absinthe (Prohibition) Act 1915, passed in the New Hebrides, has never been repealed, is included in the 2006 Vanuatu consolidated legislation, and contains the following all-encompassing restriction: \\"The manufacture, importation, circulation and sale wholesale or by retail of absinthe or similar liquors in Vanuatu shall be prohibited.\\" Cultural influence Numerous artists and writers living in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were noted absinthe drinkers and featured absinthe in their work. Some of these included √âdouard Manet, Guy de Maupassant, Paul Verlaine, Amedeo Modigliani, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Rimbaud, and √âmile Zola. Many other renowned artists and writers similarly drew from this cultural well, including Aleister Crowley, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, August Strindberg, and Erik Satie. The aura of illicitness and mystery surrounding absinthe has played into literature, movies, music, and television, where it is often portrayed as a mysterious, addictive, and mind- altering drink. Absinthe has served as the subject of numerous works of fine art, films, video, music, and literature since the mid-19th-century. Some of the earliest film references include The Hasher's Delirium (1910) by √âmile Cohl, an early pioneer in the art of animation, as well as two different silent films, each entitled Absinthe, from 1913 and 1914 respectively.

Design and development The aircraft designer Al Mooney developed an improved version of the Culver Dart, to provide improved performance with a smaller engine. Originally designated the Culver Model L the prototype first flew on 2 December 1939. The aircraft was named the Culver Cadet. Although similar to the previous Dart the Cadet had a semi-monocoque fuselage instead of welded-steel-tube and a retractable tailwheel undercarriage. The first variant (the Cadet LCA) was powered by a 75 hp (56 kW) Continental A75-8 four- cylinder horizontally-opposed piston engine. The 1941 version was designated the Cadet LFA and introduced a number of refinements and more equipment, and was fitted with a 90 hp (67 kW) Franklin engine. Production was brought to an end after the United States entered World War II in December 1941, but the Cadet had found export orders, including to Uruguay, and had a new military role. The Cadet was one of six models that Al Mooney designed during his eight years at Culver. He would leave to found Mooney Aircraft. Operational history In 1940 the Cadet LCA was selected by the United States Army Air Corps as being suitable for use as a radio-controlled target. The first aircraft was designated the Culver A-8 (later the XPQ-8) and was based on the Cadet LFA but had fixed tricycle landing gear. After successful tests a production order for 200 was placed, and designated the PQ-8, later another 200 were ordered with a more powerful engine as the PQ-8A. In late 1941 the United States Navy acquired a PQ-8A for evaluation and then ordered 200 in 1941 as the TDC-2. An enlarged and improved version was later built as the Culver PQ-14. Several Cadets, with both military and civilian origins, are still (2012) airworthy in the United States and some are preserved in airworthy condition by museums.

Born in West Nottingham, Cecil County, Maryland, Brooks grew up to become the first principal of Baltimore City College, the third oldest public high school in the United States, and the only president of the Baltimore Female College, the first institution of higher education for women in Maryland. He also was the owner of The American Museum, a literary magazine, in which he published several works of the famed poet Edgar Allan Poe, and the author of several textbooks on classical literature. Brooks died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Biography Nathan Covington Brooks, the youngest son of John and Mary Brooks, was born in West Nottingham, Cecil County, Maryland on August 12, 1809. He began his education at the West Nottingham Academy, and upon graduating enrolled at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. There he received a Master of Arts with his thesis consisting of a poem. After receiving his degree, Brooks began his teaching career at the age of 16 in Charlestown, Cecil County. He held this position for two years before opening a private school in Baltimore, Maryland in 1826, where he remained for five years. In 1831, he was elected principal of the Franklin Academy, located in Reisterstown, Maryland. After three years, Brooks resigned to become principal of the Brookeville Academy in Montgomery County, Maryland. However, in 1836, he resigned from the academy because the school was unable to pay his salary. In 1839, Brooks was unanimously selected out of a pool of 45 candidates to be the first principal of the new male high school in Baltimore‚Äîlater renamed the Baltimore City College. He served in this capacity until 1849, when he resigned to serve as the only president of the Baltimore Female College, the first institution of higher learning for women in Maryland. While at the Baltimore Female College, Brooks was granted an LL.D. from Emory College in Oxford, Georgia in 1859. He served as president of the Baltimore Female College until it was closed in 1890. Brooks was married twice and fathered 11 children. He was wed to Mary Elizabeth Gobright on May 8, 1826, and later married Christiana Octavia Crump on June 26, 1867. Brooks died on October 6, 1898 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The American Museum In 1838, Brooks purchased Summer Lincoln Fairfield's The North American Quarterly and moved the publication from Philadelphia to Baltimore. Brooks partnered with Dr. Joseph E. Snodgrass, a Baltimore physician, to transform the publication into The American Museum of Science, Literature and the Arts. The magazine mainly functioned as a literary publication, featuring literary criticism as well as poetry and short stories. Brooks, who was a friend of the famed poet Edgar Allan Poe, published several of Poe's works in The American Museum. Poe's \\"Ligeia\\", \\"A Predicament\\" (published as \\"The Scythe of Time\\"), and \\"The Haunted Palace\\" were all originally published in Brooks' magazine. Nevertheless, the magazine was short lived. Only two volumes of the magazine were published and it ceased to exist after 1839. Literary works Throughout his career as an educator, Brooks contributed poetry and prose writings to various literary magazines. Among the literary magazines that Brooks submitted works to, were Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, Graham's Magazine, the New York Mirror, and the Southern Literary Messenger. Brooks also wrote several anthologies of poetry, including Scriptural Anthology, which was published in 1837 and The Literary Amaranth, which was published in 1840. Poe wrote an ambivalent review of Brooks' Scriptural Anthology, which appeared in Graham's Magazine in December 1841. In his review, Poe wrote, \\"among many inferior compositions of length, there were several shorter pieces of great merit;‚Äîfor example 'Shelley's Obsequies' and 'The Nicthanthes'.\\" Poe was also critical of Brooks' comic works, while praising his more serious prose. In addition to his poetry and prose, Brooks authored several textbooks, which focused mainly on classical literature, and a few popular history texts. These included First Lessons in Latin, published in 1845, First Lessons in Greek, published in 1846, A Complete History Of The Mexican War, published in 1849, and The History of the Church. Brooks also translated and published several editions of the works of Ovid, Caesar, and Virgil. References External links *Works by Nathan C.

As of 1 May 2003, it is entirely owned by the Government of Guyana. Its distribution system is unique because it supplies both 50 and 60 cycle power. Domestic voltage can be 110 or 220 depending on the area. GPL employs over 1200 workers countrywide.  History  Guyana Power and Light is the main official supplier of electricity in Guyana, South America with its franchise area encompassing the entire three counties of Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo. Prior to 1 October 1999, the Company, then named the Guyana Electricity Corporation was wholly owned by the Government of Guyana. A 50/50 equity partnership was established between the Government of Guyana and a consortium comprising the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom and the Electricity Supply Board International (ESBI) of Ireland which brought into being the new Company, GPL. This partnership dissolved in April 2003 and GPL reverted to 100 percent ownership by the government and people of Guyana.  Brief historical review of electricity in Guyana  Electricity generation in Guyana started out before the turn of the twentieth century as several individual entities, private/community enterprises providing their own power. Georgetown, a relatively small enclave, received power from a private supplier. The mining areas of Linden and Everton (upper Berbice) received power from Alcan and Reynolds, both expatriate companies that respectively owned the Mackenzie (Linden) and Berbice-based bauxite operations. The municipality of New Amsterdam was powered by another private entrepreneur. The International Power Company (IPC) of Canada was in operation in Georgetown at the turn of the twentieth century. The Demerara Electric Company was established in 1925 when it purchased the assets of IPC. The British Guiana Electricity Company (BGEC) came into being in 1957, and in 1960 it purchased the assets of the Demerara Electric Company. After Independence in May 1966, the BGEC was nationalized and the Guyana Electricity Company (GEC) was established, wholly owned by the state. Thirty three years later, the Government of Guyana divested 50 percent of its ownership and control and the company was renamed Guyana Power & Light Inc. The investor was a UK-based consortium comprising the Electricity Supply Board International (ESBI) and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC). The divestiture failed and the company once again became wholly owned by the state on 1 May 2003.

He served as the eighth Archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis from 2008 to 2015. He previously served as Bishop of New Ulm from 2001 to 2007.  Early life and education  John Nienstedt was born in Detroit, Michigan, to John C. and Elizabeth S. (n√©e Kennedy) Nienstedt. The second oldest of six children, he has two brothers, Richard and Michael, and three sisters, Barbara, Mary, and Corinne. He graduated in 1969 from Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit with Bachelor of Arts degree, before studying at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Sacred Theology in 1972. On April 29, 1972, he was ordained a deacon at the Pontifical North American College. He also received a licentiate from the Pontifical Institute of St. Alphonsus in 1977.  Priest  Nienstedt was ordained a priest on July 27, 1974, in the United States. He then served as an associate pastor at Guardian Angels Parish in Clawson until 1976. He became secretary to Cardinal John Francis Dearden and a part-time professor of moral theology at St. John Provincial Seminary in Plymouth in 1977. He was also a weekend associate pastor at St. Fabian's Parish in Farmington Hills and at Our Lady of Sorrows Parish in Farmington. He became vicar general for the Archdiocese of Detroit in 1979. He accompanied Cardinal Dearden to the August 1978 papal conclave, where he met the future Pope John Paul II. In 1980, Nienstedt was assigned to the English desk of the Vatican Secretariat of State. While in Rome, he also served as a chaplain at Baby Jesus Hospital (1980‚Äì83) and to the Brothers of Holy Cross (1981‚Äì84). He earned a Doctorate in Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Institute of St. Alphonsus in 1985; his doctoral thesis was entitled, \\"Human Life in a Test-tube; the Moral Dimension of In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo transfer.\\" In early 1986, he was named temporary assistant pastor at St. Regis Church in Birmingham and adjunct professor of moral theology at SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in Orchard Lake. He was made pastor of St. Patrick's Parish in Union Lake in July that year. In 1987, Nienstedt was appointed to reorganize his alma mater Sacred Heart Seminary. He became its Rector in 1988. He became an Honorary Prelate of His Holiness in 1990 and pastor of the National Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak in 1994.  Bishop  On June 12, 1996, Nienstedt was appointed auxiliary bishop of Detroit and titular bishop of Alton by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 9 from Cardinal Adam Maida, with Cardinals James Aloysius Hickey and Edmund Szoka serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: , 'That All May Be One' (). As an auxiliary of Detroit, Nienstedt served as Episcopal Vicar for the Dearborn, Downriver, Monroe, Northwest Wayne, Southland, and Western Wayne vicariates. Nienstedt was named the third Bishop of New Ulm, Minnesota, on June 12, 2001, and was installed on August 6. He denounced the more progressive views of his predecessor, Raymond Lucker, told Catholics not to read Lucker's book as representing Catholic doctrine, and asked the US Conference of Catholic Bishops to assess the validity of his views. Discussing the Terri Schiavo case, he stated, \\"Her case demonstrates the disparity that exists in this country between laws and basic moral principles. While we cannot legislate morality, we ought not to be legislating immorality.\\" He warned that the film Brokeback Mountain was part of the agenda that \\"severs the connection between marriage and gender\\". He summarized the plot‚Äì\\"one man makes a pass at the other and within seconds the latter mounts the former in an act of wanton anal sex\\"‚Äìand called it \\"a story of lust gone bad\\". During his tenure, he chaired the Committee on Priestly Formation and was a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on Health Care Issues and the Church in the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.  Archbishop  On April 24, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Nienstedt coadjutor archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis, the designated successor to Archbishop Harry Flynn, who was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. Both Nienstedt's parents died in the course of six weeks in the winter of 2007. When Flynn's retirement was accepted on May 2, 2008, Nienstedt succeeded him as the eighth Archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis. He received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, from Pope Benedict in St. Peter's Basilica on June 29, 2008. Shortly after becoming archbishop, he discontinued the gay pride prayer service that was held at St. Joan of Arc Church in Minneapolis; he had previously described homosexuality as a \\"result of psychological trauma\\" that \\"must be understood in the context of other human disorders: envy, malice, greed, etc.\\" He declined numerous invitations to attend the 2008 Republican National Convention, which was held in St. Paul. During the 2008 presidential election, Nienstedt criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He said she had a \\"misinterpretation on the question of when life begins\\" and that her \\"remarks underscore once again the need for Catholics, and especially Catholic politicians, to form their consciences according to the moral truths taught by the Catholic Church.\\" He also criticized the Freedom of Choice Act, saying, \\"It is hard to imagine a more radical piece of pro-abortion legislation.\\" = Strategic planning = In October 2010, Nienstedt announced a strategic plan that called for 21 parishes to be merged into 14 neighboring parishes. An appeal process was put in place which included information about the right to appeal announced parish mergers to the Holy See. All appeals had run their course by early 2012. Decisions regarding buildings and other property of the merged parishes were made by local leaders in consultation with the archbishop and a representative body of priests. These and two layer mergers reduced the number of parishes from 213 in October 2010 to 188 in July 2013. The mergers involve parishes across the Archdiocese. = Positions on public issues = In October 2012 Nienstedt used more than US$600,000 in Archdiocesan funds to promote the approval of Minnesota Amendment 1 to ban same-sex marriage in the state. Minnesotans rejected the amendment at the polls on November 6, 2012, by five percentage points. Over Nienstedt's continued opposition the next session of the state legislature approved legislation legalizing same-sex marriage, which the governor signed into law on May 14, 2013. Nienstedt upholds the Catholic teaching of the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony. He stated that Satan is behind sodomy, abortion, contraception, pornography and the redefinition of marriage. He opposes embryonic stem cell research involving discarded human embryo stem cell lines, and later bar-closing times. = Investigations of alleged personal misconduct = The Archdiocese announced on December 17, 2013, that Nienstedt had voluntarily \\"stepped aside from all public ministry\\" after learning that on December 16 local police launched an investigation into an allegation that he had touched a boy on the buttocks during a post- confirmation photo session in 2009. The Archdiocese had encouraged the person who reported the incident to them to contact the police. Nienstedt maintained that this allegation against him was \\"absolutely and entirely false.\\" On March 11, 2014, county officials announced they had concluded an \\"intensive investigation\\" and would not file charges against Nienstedt, who announced his return to public ministry the same day. In July 2014, it was announced that Nienstedt was under a non-criminal investigation by his diocese for \\"sexual misconduct with men.\\" He commented saying \\"I have never engaged in sexual misconduct and certainly have not made any sexual advances toward anyone. ... The allegations do not involve minors or lay members of the faithful, and they do not implicate any kind of illegal or criminal behavior.\\" = Handling of accusations of priestly sexual abuse = The archbishop was criticized in 2014 for the way \\"his diocese has dealt with sexually abusive priests\\".Paulson, Michael, \\"Archbishop, Under Fire Over Abuse, Apologizes but Says He Won‚Äôt Resign\\", New York Times, July 30, 2014. Retrieved August 2, 2014. Nienstedt responded, writing in a diocesan publication that although \\"it is very clear that we did not handle all complaints the way we should have in the past ... I have never knowingly covered up clergy sexual abuse [and] I promise to make changes\\".Nienstedt, Archbishop John C., \\"Tough lessons lead to significant changes\\", TheCatholicSpirit.com July 30, 2014. Retrieved August 2, 2014. Six priests publicly criticized Nienstedt's handling of the allegations, with some calling for his resignation. Nienstedt said that he would only resign if the papal nuncio took action. Nienstedt testified under oath in a civil court in 2014 about his knowledge of priests accused of child sexual abuse. He said in an April 2, 2014 deposition that he had not known until March 2014 that a Rev. Kenneth LaVan, a priest accused in the 1980s of sexual assault of at least one teenage girl and \\"sexually exploiting\\" several women, was still in ministry in violation of church policy. Documents released in August 2014 as part of a lawsuit against the Archdiocese showed that the archbishop received several updates on LaVan and approved his continuing work at Twin Cities parishes, as recently as August 15, 2013. The documents also indicate that Nienstedt had spent time socially with LaVan, as recently as June 2013. Nienstedt also testified under oath that he had first learned of the criminal conviction of the Rev. Gilbert Gustafson, an archdiocesan priest, \\"during the last six months\\", and claimed little knowledge of Gustafson. Documents subsequently released by Minnesota Public Radio in October 2014 showed that Nienstedt had been informed by letter by a parish director of music in 2008 of Gustafson's prior criminal convictions for sexual assault of boys, and that Nienstedt had replied to the letters. = Resignation = On June 5, 2015 it was announced that a Minnesota prosecutor was bringing criminal charges and initiating a civil suit against the archdiocese for failing to protect children from sexual abuse. Ramsey County prosecutor John J. Choi alleged \\"a disturbing institutional and systemic pattern of behavior committed by the highest levels of leadership of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis over the course of decades\\". Nienstedt (aged 68) and Auxiliary Bishop Lee A. Pich√© (57) submitted their resignations to their posts, citing the provision of canon law that allows a bishop to resign when some \\"grave reason\\" makes it impossible to continue to fulfill his duties. Pope Francis accepted the resignations on June 15, 2015. Nienstedt issued a statement that said he resigned \\"with a clear conscience knowing that my team and I have put in place solid protocols to ensure the protection of minors and vulnerable adults.\\" Pope Francis named Bernard Hebda, Coadjutor Archbishop of Newark, to serve as the Archdiocese's Apostolic Administrator; he was appointed Archbishop on March 24, 2016. After resignation After he resigned his position in Minnesota, Nienstedt returned to Michigan, where he has a home on Lake Huron. In 2016, he served briefly as substitute priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalamazoo, but quit after only a week due to objections from local parishioners in Battle Creek. He moved again in 2016 to Napa Valley, California, where he worked as an independent contractor for the Napa Institute, editing conference proceedings for publication. He also participated in their annual conference and said Mass. On 15 August 2018, after being criticized for its relationship with Nienstedt while condemning the Church's failure to hold prelates like Cardinal Theodore McCarrick accountable, the Institute announced that Nienstedt had \\"stepped aside\\" from his responsibilities, and that it was understood that the Institute had been advised that \\"there are no restrictions on Archbishop Nienstedt‚Äôs ministry\\".https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/minnesota-prelate- steps-aside-responsibilities-napa-institute In July 2016, documents related to the investigation by the diocese into Nienstedt were released. He retains his status as an archbishop.

Mansfield is a professor of government at Harvard University. In this book, he defines manliness as \\"confidence in a situation of risk\\" and suggests this quality is currently undervalued in Western society. He suggests the quality is more common in men than in women, but doesn't strictly exclude women, for example he names Margaret Thatcher. He also suggests the quality is \\"good and bad\\", not all good, but not all bad. His main point is that gender neutral ideology denies both the reality of sex-specific qualities, and the valuable components of these, to the detriment of society. Mansfield attributes the rise of gender neutral ideology firstly to Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx and Jean-Paul Sartre, and then to feminists who repackaged the ideas as part of a political program. He names Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer.  Overview  > Today the very word manliness seems quaint and obsolete. We are in the > process of making the English language gender-neutral, and manliness, the > quality of one gender, or rather, of one sex, seems to describe the essence > of the enemy we are attacking, the evil we are eradicating. -Harvey > Mansfield, Manliness Mansfield evaluates the concept of manliness as it has been expressed over the course of Western civilization, and considers its virtues. As Mansfield stated to NPR's Tom Ashbrook, \\"Some people say manliness doesn't exist. Others say it does exist and it's bad. I say it exists and it's good ... and bad.\\"Harvey Mansfield, \\"Manliness,\\" NPR's On Point, August 30, 2006. Accessed November 7, 2007. Drawing on classical philosophy, literature, and science, Mansfield argues that manliness is a virtue primarily associated with the male sex which is preferable to widespread institutional gender-neutral ideology. Beginning with modern scientific discoveries, Mansfield appropriates them for insights on how these innate biological realities might exert an influence on gender identity and gender role preferences. Mansfield then proceeds to literature, drawing on Homer, Rudyard Kipling, and Hemingway to support his thesis that manliness has been a perpetual component of the male psyche and behavior. Mansfield then offers an analysis of the historical forces in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, singling out Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan, and Germaine Greer as the key writers to have influenced, what he considers to be, the dismantling of manliness. These writers shared two common hypotheses they derived from earlier writers: from Marx they drew the theory of economic exploitation, and from Nietzsche their flirtations with nihilism. Finally, Mansfield turns to Aristotle as the archetypal expounder of manliness to identify the quality of \\"philosophical courage,\\" which Mansfield concludes is the ideal understanding of manliness.

The work is on display at the Uffizi in Florence. Botticelli was commissioned to paint at least seven versions of The Adoration of the Magi. This version was commissioned by Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama for his funerary chapel in Santa Maria Novella. Inserted Medici portraits In the scene numerous characters are present, among which are several members of the Medici family: Cosimo de' Medici (the Magus kneeling in front of the Virgin, described by Giorgio Vasari as \\"the finest of all that are now extant for its life and vigour\\"), his sons Piero (the second Magus kneeling in the centre with the red mantle) and Giovanni (the third Magus), and his grandsons Giuliano and Lorenzo. The three Medici portrayed as Magi were all dead at the time the picture was painted, and Florence was effectively ruled by Lorenzo. Whether Botticelli's intimate relations with the Medici brothers allowed the wealthy Gaspare to introduce the portraits of their kinsmen in his altar-piece, or Gaspare was glad for this opportunity to pay a graceful compliment to these powerful personages is hard to tell. It is, however, apparent from the great pains Botticelli took with these figures, that this formed an important part of the task. Also Gaspare himself is said to be included in the painting, as the old man on the right with white hair and a light blue robe looking and pointing at the observer. Furthermore, Botticelli is alleged to have made a self-portrait as the blonde man with yellow mantle on the far right. Style In his Lives, Vasari describes the Adoration in the following way: > of the heads in this scene is indescribable, their attitudes all different, > some full-face, some in profile, some three-quarters, some bent down, and in > various other ways, while the expressions of the attendants, both young and > old, are greatly varied, displaying the artist's perfect mastery of his > profession. Sandro further clearly shows the distinction between the suites > of each of the kings. It is a marvelous work in colour, design and > composition. The attention to details, such as the garments rendering, shows the acquisition by the Florentine artist of the influences from the Flemish school at this point of his career.

The creature was given life by ritualistic chants. It was then placed into the sea to seek and destroy a specific enemy. The use of a tupilaq was risky, however, because if it was sent to destroy someone who had greater magical powers than the one who had formed it, it could be sent back to kill its maker instead,Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 23; Plate XLIII, XLV although the maker of tupilaq could escape by public confession of her or his own deed.Kleivan and Sonne 1985: 23, 10 Because tupilaqs were made in secret, in isolated places and from perishable materials, none have been preserved. Early European visitors to Greenland, fascinated by the native legend, were eager to see what tupilaqs looked like so the Inuit began to carve representations of them out of sperm whale teeth. Today, tupilaqs of many different shapes and sizes are carved from various materials such as narwhal and walrus tusk, wood and caribou antler. They are an important part of Greenlandic Inuit art and are highly prized as collectibles.  Publicity versus secrecy  The making of a tupilaq started most often at night, in secrecy. The shaman (angakkuq) would don the anorak backwards, with the hood over his face, and engage in sexual contact with the bones used to make a tupilaq, singing and chanting during the entire process, which could take several days. The myth states that the making of a tupilaq was risky to its own maker if the attacked person made it rebound: in this case, public confession was the only rescue. The magic consequences of situations of concealment, and the neutralizing effect of public confession was believed also in several other areas of life, thus, this is an example of the more general topic of secrecy versus publicity.Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 10 = Concealment = Concealment or secrecy was believed to raise magic consequences in several areas of life: * Concealed miscarriage or infanticide could give birth to a monster called anngiaq.Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 14‚Äì15 * It could make harm for the community if somebody concealed his/her taboo breach. * Secrecy was also preliminary for the functioning of so-called formulae (texts or songs used like charm or spell in danger, need, hunt, practical everyday situations).Kleivan & Sonne 1985:9‚Äì10Rasmussen 1927: 136‚Äì137 (= 206, 209 in PDF) = Neutralizing effect of public confession = Thus, concealment was a preliminary for several magical effects. If this was broken, unintentionally or intentionally, the effect could lose its power. * Angakkuit in some groups resolved the consequence of taboo breach by achieving public confession of the breacher.Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 26, 28 * Hunting means killing, and animals were believed to have souls as well. Efforts were made to avoid the revenge taken by the game and to please the game symbolically.Burch & Forman 1988: 96 Such would be the danger inherent in the first kill of a boy and it was \\"neutralized\\" by a public ritual, in which each adult member of the community had to make an incision into the head of the game, or eat a piece from it. Thus, the belief was, that public partaking in a dangerous thing reduced the danger, that it has a neutralizing effect.Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 16  Meanings of the same term in various Inuit cultures  Inuit cultures were, and are, far from being alike, although there were some similarities.Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 2 The tupilaq concept had variants. It might be a man-made object, a ghost-like being or a haunting soul. In some cultures it was exactly the shaman who had to deal with it. Such distant groups like the Caribou Inuit, Greenlandic Inuit, Iglulingmiut Inuit and Copper Inuit knew the concept of tupilaq,Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 22‚Äì23 but the details differed: ;Igloolik :The tupilaq was an invisible ghost. Only the shaman could notice it. It was the soul of a dead person, which became restless because the breach of some death taboo. It scared game away from the vicinity. Thus, the shaman had to help by scaring it away with a knife.Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 23 ;Caribou Inuit :The tupilaq was also an invisible being. Like a tupilaq of the Iglulik, also the shaman was the only one who could see it. It was a chimera-like creature, with human head and parts from different species of animals. It was dangerous, it could attack the settlement. Then, the shaman had to combat it and devour it with his/her helping spirits. ;Greenland :The tupilaq was manifested in the real, human-made object. It was made by people to the detriment of their enemies. It was a puppet-like thing, but was thought of have magical power onto the victim. It might be made from mixed parts of dead animals and dead children. ;Copper Inuit :To the Copper Inuit the tupilaq was similar to the Devil of Christianity.

He spent the bulk of his 30-year career with the St. Louis Cardinals, owned by his uncle, Sam Breadon, from 1920 through 1947. He also served as a vice president of Breadon's Western Automobile Company, later Sam Breadon Inc.Newspapers.com (1935), \\"Head of Cardinals Renames Auto Firm 'Sam Breadon, Inc.'\\" Walsingham began as a ticket- taker with the Cardinals, but by the early 1940s he had become a vice president of the Redbirds. When Breadon parted company with his longtime general manager, Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, at the close of the 1942 campaign, Walsingham became the club's chief of baseball operations, although the GM title was not formally assigned to him. He was part of a management triumvirate that included Breadon and the Cardinals' chief scout, Joe Mathes. Walsingham continued as a vice president of the Cards, GM without portfolio, and a member of its board of directors after Breadon sold the club to Robert E. Hannegan and Fred Saigh in 1947. In January 1953, Saigh was forced to dispose of the Cardinals after his conviction on income tax evasion charges. Walsingham stepped in as the team's official National League representative and chief executive, as rumors swirled that he would assemble a syndicate to buy the franchise. However, August A. Busch Jr. came forward as the team's new owner; the \\"beer baron\\" would operate the Cardinals for the next 36 years. Busch appointed a brewery executive, Richard A. Meyer, as the Cardinals' general manager upon his purchase of the team, but Walsingham remained a vice president in the Cardinal front office until October 1955, when Frank Lane succeeded Meyer as GM. Walsingham said that he resigned \\"because I believe a ball club cannot be successfully run by two people, both of whom are confident they can do the job.\\" In 1957, Walsingham was named an executive vice president with the American League's Baltimore Orioles ‚Äî ironically, the transplanted St. Louis Browns, who had spent 50 years in St. Louis fighting a losing battle against the Cardinals for the affections of the city's fans before leaving town in 1953. His appointment was an attempt by the Orioles to rein in Paul Richards' freewheeling spending on amateur talent and to phase him out of his general manager duties in order for him to concentrate on managing the ballclub. Walsingham failed to establish any authority within the organization and was ignored by Richards who continued to operate in the dual role unimpeded. Walsingham was dismissed on October 30, 1958 and eventually replaced by Lee MacPhail who became general manager after Richards agreed to relinquish such duties.Miller, James Edward.

It was introduced into bowling alleys in the 1970s and combined with mechanical pinsetters for detecting the pins bowled down. Automatic scorers took away the task of having to keep score by hand by using a specialized computer designed for the task of automatically keeping the tally. This also introduced new bowlers to the game that otherwise would not participate because of having to keep score themselves, as most do not understand the mathematical formula involved in bowler scoring. At first people were skeptical if a computer could keep accurate score. By the twenty- first century it is used in most bowling centers worldwide. The three manufactures of these specialized computers are Brunswick Bowling, AMF Bowling and RCA.  History  Inside 1970s computer console apparatus Automatic equipment is considered a cornerstone of the modern bowling center. The traditional bowling center of the early 20th century was advanced in automation when the pinsetter person (\\"pin boy\\"), who set back up by hand the bowled down pins, was replaced by a machine that automatically replaced the pins in their proper play positions. This machine came out in the 1950s. A detection system was developed from the pinsetter mechanism in the 1960s that could tell which pins had been knocked down, and that information could be transferred to a digital computer. Automatic electronic scoring was first conceived by Robert Reynolds, an electronic calculator expert. He worked with Brunswick Bowling technicians to develop it. It was realized in the late 1960s when a specialized computer was designed for the purpose of automatic scorekeeping for bowling. This increased the popularity of the sport. The automatic scorer was first field tested at Village Lanes bowling center, Chicago in 1967. The scoring machine received approval for official use by the American Bowling Congress in August of that year. They were first used in national official league gaming on October 10, 1967. In November Brunswick announced that they were accepting orders for the new digital computer, which cost around $3,000 per bowling lane. Bowling centers that installed these new automatic scoring devices in the 1970s charged a dime extra per line of scoring for the convenience. California was considered the best prospect for making the first sales since it was the only state where bowlers paid an individual for league scorekeeping.  Description  1970s circuit board schematic diagram showing electronic input system for tally. Each Automatic Scorer computer unit kept score for four lanes. It had two bowler identification panels serving two lanes each. The bowler pushed it into his named position when his turn came up so the computer knew who was bowling and score accordingly. After the bowler rolled the bowling ball down the lane and knocked down pins, the pinsetter detected which pins were down and relayed this information back to the computer for scoring. It was then printed on a scoresheet and projected overhead onto a large screen for all to see. The Automatic Scorer digital computer was mathematically accurate, however the detection system at the pinsetter mechanism sometimes reported the wrong number of pins knocked down. The computer could be corrected manually for this as well as handicap figures added and late arriving bowlers tallied. The automatic scoring is directly connected to the foul detection unit so that foul line violations are automatically scored. Brunswick put in ten years of research and developed a computer that kept the score of bowling and labeled it the Automatic Scorer. By 1972 there were over 500 of these computers installed in bowling centers worldwide. AMF Bowling, competitor to Brunswick, entered into the automatic scorer computer field in 1973 and their systems were installed into their brand of bowling centers. AMF and Brunswick each had their set of Customer Service Engineers in a territorial area that repaired the computers. By 1974 RCA was also making these computers for automatic scoring.  Reception  The purposes of the computerized scoring were to avoid errors by human scorers and to prevent cheating. It had the side benefit of speeding up the progress of the game and introducing new bowlers to the game. Score-keeping for bowling is based on a formula that many new to bowling were not familiar with and thought difficult to learn. These casual bowlers unfamiliar with the formula thought the scores given by the computers were confusing. Some bowlers did not trust automatic scorers when they were introduced in the 1970s, so kept score using the traditional method on paper score sheets to verify the accuracy of the reporting. Automatic scorers are considered the normal part of modern bowling installations worldwide. The owners and managers say that bowlers expect these scoring system computers in 21st century bowling establishments. Many state that business has increased since their introduction. The traditional 'bowling alleys' have become known as 'bowling centers' since the introduction of the color television style automatic scorer in 1983. These type of electronic visual displays show bowler avatars and social media connections to publish the bowlers' scores. Bowling center owners can use these style automatic scorers for advertising, management, videos, and live television. Some are capable of being extended entertainment systems of games for children and adults. The automatic scoring bowling computers of the 21st century detect electronically if a bowling pin has been knocked down. This is done with fluorescent coatings on the outer surface of the wooden pins. This is an ionomer cladding material put on a preselected area of the bowling pin, usually in the neck portion. It consists of a particular type of coating that emits a high level of light when hit with ultraviolet light. Another coating is put on the pin that emits a moon-glow and thereby amplifies the first coating's light by the contrast. This then makes it detectable by an electronic sensor if the pin is still standing. That detected pin or knocked down pin is a signal sent back to the automatic scorer computer for the tally and keeps score for the bowler.

It was first proclaimed on 13 April 1999 by American businessman Howard Turney (\\"Prince Lazarus\\"); the project has recently been revived (in early 2017). History The project was founded in 1995 when Lazarus Long, the founder of New Utopia, came across a shallow unclaimed underwater area in the Caribbean Sea. He then filed a claim with the United Nations. Long raised up to $100 million from investors from all over the world, with a majority coming from the United States. Then, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) termed New Utopia a \\"fraudulent nationwide Internet scheme\\",\\"EXHIBIT: Fake Nations\\", Quatloos.com. Retrieved 30 May 2007. and complained that Long had made \\"material misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the status of construction of the project, the companies associated with the project, the safety of the investment, and the status of the Commission's investigation into his activities.\\"US SEC ruling, Litigation Release No. 16425 / February 4, 2000. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Lazarus R. Long (a/k/a Howard Turney individually and doing business as New Utopia,) USDC/NDOK/TULSA CA No. 99CV 0257BU(M) The SEC's case against Long (SEC v. Lazarus Long) ruled against Long. Lazarus Long died in April 2012 at age 88.> New Utopia's project was restarted in early 2017 by Lazarus Long's daughter Elizabeth Henderson, who promises to have the Project completed by 2021. Structure The social model and trade system would have been hyper-capitalistic, modeled after the writings of Ayn Rand, Napoleon Hill, Robert Heinlein, Dale Carnegie, and Adam Smith. Long also promised that the tiny nation would have a clinic better than the Mayo Clinic, a casino modelled after the Monte Carlo Casino, and \\"the ultimate luxury spa\\". Residents would live in one of the 642 apartments and condominiums that would be built. It would have been a tax haven, with all services paid for by a 20% tax on imported consumable goods. Founder Before creating New Utopia, Howard Turney had been introduced to the Human Growth Hormone (HGH) by an anti-aging doctor. He was so impressed with the results that he became an advocate of the hormone and in February 1993 he created a longevity spa called El Dorado Clinic in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. In 1995 he changed his name to Lazarus Long, a recurrent character in Heinlein's novels who goes through several rejuvenation treatments in order to live hundreds of years and eventually become immortal. Also around 1995 he stopped injecting HGH in the El Dorado clinic because of the corruption of local officers, and he moved to the US. A few years later he had to stop injecting HGH also in the US when doctors stopped prescribing it due to illegal doping in sport. Then he tried to fund New Utopia, a place where the government couldn't tell him what he could do and what he couldn't. But in 1999 the SEC closed his bond offering because the bonds were not registered with them. He dedicated the rest of his life to the creation of New Utopia.

A native of Newport News, Virginia, McRae played college football as a halfback at the University of Michigan from 1959 to 1961 and professional football, principally as a cornerback, for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Chicago Bears (1962‚Äì1970) and New York Giants (1971). Early years McRae was born in Aberdeen, North Carolina, in 1939. He attended Collis P. Huntington High School in Newport News, Virginia. University of Michigan McRae enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1958 and played college football at the halfback position for head coach Bump Elliott's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1959 to 1961. In November 1961, McRae demonstrated his versatility, scoring three touchdowns‚Äîon a five- yard run, a 15-yard reception, and a 34-yard interception return‚Äîin a 28‚Äì14 victory over Duke. In three years at Michigan, he rushed for 1,037 yards on 231 carries for an average of 4.5 yards per carry. He also had 411 receiving yards, 465 yards on 24 kickoff returns and 171 yards on 29 punt returns. McRae was also a star track athlete at Michigan, competing in both the high and low hurdles. He won four Big Ten Conference hurdle championships and was ranked as one of the top 10 hurdlers in the world in 1961 by Track and Field News. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 2002. Professional football McRae was selected by the Chicago Bears in the second round (21st overall pick) of the 1962 NFL Draft. He signed with the Bears in June 1962, and went on to play nine seasons for the Bears from 1962 to 1970, principally at the cornerback position. In October 1966, McRae was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Week after intercepting two Johnny Unitas passes and knocking down several others to lead the Bears to an upset victory over the Baltimore Colts. One of his interceptions was made seven yards into the end zone and was followed by a 53-yard runback. In nine seasons with the Bears, McRae had 27 interceptions, including six during the 1963 NFL season. He also held the Bears' franchise record with four interceptions returned for touchdowns. In September 1971, the Bears traded McRae and Bob Hyland to the New York Giants in exchange for the Giants' No. 1 pick in the 1972 NFL Draft. McRae appeared in eight games for the Giants during the 1971 NFL season. Later years After retiring from football, McRae went into the construction business as the proprietor of McRae Construction Co. in Newport News. In 1973, he left the contracting business to focus on developing plans for housing projects. McRae was married, and he and his wife, Suzanne, had seven children.

Whether the car is partially scrapped or completely totaled. Automotive restoration can be applied to many different eras of the automobile. Heritage railways and railway museums aim to restore and operate restored trains. Bus preservation groups aim to purchase buses of various eras to restore them to their original operating condition. Trains and buses are often restored to the original authentic livery of their original owner. Restoration process A BMW R60/2 motorcycle undergoing a frame-up Concours restoration Restoration of a vehicle refers to the process of restoring a vehicle to its original condition. Neither updating nor modifying are considered part of the restoration process. A restored car is one that has had all of its systems and/or parts restored to original condition. Selectively restoring parts or systems is referred to as refurbishing. It does not qualify as restoration. Rebuilding an engine may restore that engine, but it does not restore the car, or entitle the car to be called a restoration. A car that has had its bodywork restored to as new condition but has undergone some modifications elsewhere is either a modified car or a resto-mod car, neither being completely restored nor completely modified. If a car has had an engine swap for other than the original model, that car has not been restored. Although most of the parts are original, it qualifies as modified rather than restored. There are many aspects to the process of vehicle restoration. The goal is to return the vehicle to its 'original' state. To accomplish this, a vehicle must often undergo many structural and aesthetic changes. The first project is disassembly. The car is taken apart and the chassis is inspected. The chassis must be in order as it is the structural foundation of the vehicle. The next tasks are typically the vehicle's engine and mechanisms. The restorer will mechanically bring the vehicle into working order before aesthetically restoring the interior and exterior of the vehicle. Once the vehicle is mechanically functional the body work is then done to the car. Once the exterior restoration is completed, the last task is the interior finish. The restoration of the car is complete when the interior restoration is completed. Interior restoration Interior restoration is the process of returning the inside of the vehicle to its original factory state. Often a vehicle‚Äôs interior must be need to be completely stripped out before restoration can occur. This is because deterioration over time that can leave materials like wood, cloth or leather in unusable condition. Also abandoned vehicles have the potential to contain biohazardous material within the cabin caused by decay and habitation by animals. Often seating will be stripped to the wire framing before being stuffed and upholstered. The seat is still considered to be authentic after undergoing this process. Other areas of interior restoration include replaced instrument paneling, car radios, flooring and wooden paneling All mechanical and electronic equipment such as a speedometer, gas gauge, air bags and other equipment necessary to the safe operation of the vehicle must be inspected. The vehicle interior is considered restored when it is returned the state of function and aesthetic the car was in after its manufacture Exterior restoration Restoration of a vehicle‚Äôs exterior can take many forms. A vehicle that has been left or abandoned will often accumulate rust over time. Sometimes this rust deterioration can render an exterior part unusable. In which case a replacement part like a fender, front grill or door mirror must be purchased outright from an external source. If rust damage is minor however the part will undergo rust repair. This is the process of removing rust from metal and returning structural integrity. This is accomplished by removing the rust through sanding or blasting to get down to bare metal. Then new sheet metal or fiberglass is applied to the affected area. Finally the piece is worked until smooth, primed and re-painted. Other materials like glass and weather stripping must be replaced as they become damaged over time. Factors like weather erosion can lead to faded and broken glass as well as dried out weather stripping. Another typical area of exterior repair is dent removal. This entails taking the original metal and re-working it to remove dents and other such blemishes. Professionals often use hammer and dolly work to remove dents. This involves placing the dented metal piece over a curved metal dolly and using an electric or manual hammer to remove the dent and smooth the metal. Often, vehicles require plastic headlight restoration as headlights can become foggy over time due to weathering. Engine restoration The internal combustion engine requires regular maintenance to ensure its continued function. Engine oil, power steering and brake fluid are examples of engine maintenance that must be kept and checked at regular intervals. Often wear and tear over time can leave an engine totally unusable, in which case the restorer might remove the existing engine and replace it with a similar or modern engine substitute. In order to conduct an engine restoration first a technician will conduct a thorough inspection. Often pre-restored vehicle have engines that have gone without maintenance for years and therefore require engine restoration to return them to working order. The engine is removed from the car and inspected for broken and non- functional parts. Typical parts that require replacing include the pistons, spark plugs, fuel lines, battery, fuses, timing belt and various gaskets. All are subject to deterioration over time. Structural components like the engine block, cam shaft and crank shaft are less likely to require repair but not uncommon. Typically, after all required parts are gathered, the disassembled pieces will be cleaned, lubricated (if required), and reassembled. The engine is then replaced within the car. A mechanic will then perform a series of tests to ensure that the engine is in working, road worthy condition. This is known as a pre-start engine check. First all the lines and hoses are checked for breaks and leaks. Second the radiator is topped off with water to ensure that the system is sealed off. Next the oil level is replenished. Finally the battery charge is checked and the ignition system is inspected. The engine is then ready to be started. Vehicle Conservation Vehicle conservation refers more broadly to the conservation of very old vehicles for the purposes of preserving history, rather than transportation. A mechanic can provide specific instructions on which chemicals to use on older paints and metals in order to preserve the integrity of the frame.

Built by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&S;) and completed in 1908, it was the first bridge of any kind to be built across the lower Columbia River, preceding the first road bridge, the nearby Interstate Bridge, by a little more than eight years. The bridge has a swing span, which pivots on its base to allow for the passage of taller ships. The bridge carries two railroad tracks, which are used by BNSF, Union Pacific Railroad, and Amtrak. It is one of only two surviving swing-span bridges in the Portland metropolitan area, which once had several bridges of that type. The other survivor is another BNSF bridge located nearby, on the same line and built at the same time, the Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge (also known as BNSF Railway Bridge 8.8). The 9.6 in the name is the distance, in miles, from Portland's Union Station, the same as for Bridge 5.1 (across the Willamette River) and Bridge 8.8 on the same line. History Construction of a single- track railroad bridge at the same location was started in 1890, engineered by George S. Morison for the Portland & Puget Sound Railroad Company (affiliated with Union Pacific), but that project was abandoned at an early stage. In 1905, another crossing of the Columbia River was proposed, this time by the Northern Pacific Railway (NP), for use by the newly formed Portland & Seattle Railway. The Portland & Seattle had been formed jointly by NP and Great Northern Railway, to build and ultimately operate new railroad lines from Portland to Seattle and Portland to Spokane, but was renamed Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway (SP&S;) ‚Äì in early 1908, before opening any track sections ‚Äì after construction of the Portland‚ÄìSpokane line got under way before the Seattle line. The planned new railroad was commonly referred to as the \\"North Bank road\\" (road being short for railroad or railroad line), or North Bank line, because the Seattle line would follow the Columbia River's north bank as far as Kelso and the Spokane line would also follow the north bank, running east from Vancouver. East from Portland, the south bank of the Columbia already had a rail line, owned by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (later absorbed by Union Pacific Railroad). The bridge was part of an overall planned new line from Vancouver to Northwest Portland, which included three major new bridges: the Columbia River Bridge, Oregon Slough Bridge and Willamette Drawbridge. Northern Pacific hired bridge builder Ralph Modjeski to design all three. On November 14, 1905, the SP&S; board approved Modjeski's recommendations. Plans for the bridges were submitted to the War Department, and eventually approved in February 1906. Pier 2 of the Columbia River bridge, the pier on which the swing-span section pivots, was built as part of the canceled 1890 project, and was incorporated into the plans for the 1906 bridge. Aerial view in 2016, looking towards Vancouver, with the swing span opened for a barge The first work was performed on February 8, 1906, when work crews began framing the caissons. The steel was fabricated by the American Bridge Company of New York. Construction took approximately 26 months. Steel construction at the site began on June 15, 1907. Structural work on the bridge was completed in June 1908, but its opening to traffic was delayed by problems concerning installation of the heavy machinery required to turn the huge swing span on the new Willamette River bridge located on the same line. The span was the first bridge of any kind to be built across the lower Columbia River, preceding the first road bridge, the nearby Interstate Bridge, by a little more than eight years. The first train crossed the span on October 23, 1908, and the bridge opened for regular use in November 1908. This completed the initial SP&S; route, between Portland and Pasco. Ownership and operation of the bridge passed to the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) in 1970, when SP&S;, Northern Pacific and other railroads merged to form BN. At the end of 1996, BN merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe), becoming the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (officially shortened to BNSF Railway in 2005). Operation The swing span is located at the bridge's north end, in Washington, a short distance from the Vancouver Amtrak station. All trains using the bridge are required to call the bridge tender to obtain permission to cross. A bridge tender is on duty 24 hours a day, year-round. Boats requesting an opening should contact the bridge over VHF channel 13. The bridge's swing span is opened for river traffic an average of 12 times per day.

The first two games were scratch-off tickets, Beginner's Luck ($1) and Kentucky Derby Dreamstakes ($2). Like all state lotteries in the US, the minimum age to play is 18. History The first legally authorized \\"lottery\\" in Kentucky was held in 1792 in order to raise funds to build a church in Lexington. A modern lottery was a highly debated topic in the gubernatorial race of 1987. Wallace G. Wilkinson, who went on to become governor, touted the introduction of a state lottery in a heavily funded campaign that ended up being one of the biggest gubernatorial victories in Kentucky history. As the incumbent Lieutenant Governor, Steve Beshear opposed the lottery in the 1987 race. Ironically, 20 years later, Beshear became Governor-Elect after running on a platform in support of legalized gambling in Kentucky in the 2007 race against Ernie Fletcher.

McCarthy III (born 1959) is an American columnist for National Review. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. A Republican, he led the 1995 terrorism prosecution against Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and eleven others. The defendants were convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and planning a series of attacks against New York City landmarks. He also contributed to the prosecutions of terrorists who bombed United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He resigned from the Justice Department in 2003. During the presidency of Barack Obama, McCarthy characterized Obama as a radical and a socialist, and authored a book alleging that Obama was advancing a \\"Sharia Agenda\\". He authored another book calling for Obama's impeachment. He defended false claims that the Affordable Care Act would lead to \\"death panels\\", and promoted the conspiracy theory that Bill Ayers, co-founder of the militant radical left-wing organization Weather Underground, had authored Obama's autobiography Dreams from My Father. During Donald Trump's presidency, McCarthy defended Trump amid calls for his impeachment, and authored the 2019 book Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency. Early life and career McCarthy is the oldest of six children. His father died when he was 13. He graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx borough of New York City, and Columbia College. After graduating from Columbia, McCarthy became a Deputy United States Marshal in the Federal Witness Protection Program. While working at the US Marshal's Office, he studied law at New York Law School. He later joined the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York as a paralegal. In 1986, he was hired as a prosecutor at the Southern District and worked directly for then US Attorney for the district, Rudy Giuliani. In 1995, McCarthy led the successful prosecution of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and eleven others for planning and carrying out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the planning of a series of further attacks against New York City landmarks. McCarthy led the satellite office of the Southern District, in White Plains, New York, for five years, where he investigated the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. After the September 11th attacks in 2001, McCarthy's became a key member of a command team of prosecutors tasked with drafting search warrants and \\"connecting dots\\" in the ensuing investigations. McCarthy is currently a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, serving as the director of the FDD's Center for Law and Counterterrorism. He has served as an attorney for Rudy Giuliani, and is also an opinion columnist for National Review and Commentary. He has also been a regular contributor to Fox News. He has also served as an adjunct professor at New York Law School and Fordham University School of Law. Views = Prosecution of terrorism = McCarthy was a key member of the terrorism prosecution team after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Starting in the late 1990s, however, he became a vocal skeptic of the use the Southern District of New York's law enforcement infrastructure as the primary method of countering terrorism, stating: ‚ÄúWe've become headquarters for counterterrorism in the United States.... Not the CIA. Not anyplace in Washington. The U.S. attorney‚Äôs office for the Southern District of New York. From the country‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs not a good thing.‚Äù A prosecutor‚Äôs job, he added, ‚Äúis not the national security of the United States.‚Äù He harshly criticized the Obama administration for trying suspected terrorists in civilian courts. = Support for Rudy Giuliani = McCarthy has known Rudy Giuliani since at least as early 1986, when he began his career under Giuliani at the Southern District of New York. In February 2007, McCarthy authored an endorsement for the fledgling candidacy of Rudy Giuliani during the 2008 presidential election campaign in the National Review. McCarthy also served as Giuliani's attorney during the campaign. = Barack Obama = During the 2008 presidential election campaign, McCarthy wrote a number of posts on the National Reviews Corner blog stating that he thought that Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama was not serious about protecting United States national security against threats from Islamic extremism and elsewhere, and that Obama had a number of troubling ties and associations with leftist radicals. McCarthy promoted the conspiracy theory that Bill Ayers, co-founder of the militant radical left-wing organization Weather Underground, had authored Obama's autobiography Dreams from My Father. McCarthy reviewed the article as \\"thorough, thoughtful, and alarming\\". McCarthy argued in October 2008, \\"that the issue of Obama's personal radicalism, including his collaboration with radical, America-hating Leftists, should have been disqualifying.\\" He claimed that Obama was engaged in \\"bottom- up socialism.\\" McCarthy defended Sarah Palin's false claim that Obama's health care reform, the Affordable Care Act, would lead to the creation of \\"death panels.\\" In May 2009, McCarthy provided details of a letter declining an invitation from Attorney General Eric Holder for a round-table meeting with President Barack Obama concerning the status of people detained in the War on Terror. McCarthy noted his dissension with the administration in their policies regarding the detainees. On December 5, 2009 he came out publicly against prosecuting Islamic terrorists in civil courts rather than military tribunals, saying \\"A war is a war. A war is not a crime, and you don't bring your enemies to a courthouse.\\" Throughout the Obama administration, McCarthy promoted views about the Obama administration's advancement of a \\"Sharia Agenda\\", arguing that radical Islamists were working with liberals within the United States government to subvert democracy in the West. In 2014, McCarthy published a book calling for Obama's impeachment, saying Obama had committed seven categories of impeachable offenses. He said, \\"the failure to pursue impeachment is likely to be suicide for the country.\\" = Jamal Khashoggi = After prominent Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi operatives, McCarthy claimed that Khashoggi might have been an operative of the Muslim Brotherhood. = Gun violence = McCarthy has stated on Fox News that he supports gun violence restraining orders as a tool for American law enforcement to remove firearms from those found to be a danger to themselves and/or others. He believes that the measures can reduce the country's gun violence problem. = Donald Trump = In 2019, he authored Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency. President Trump endorsed the book in September 2019. McCarthy defended Trump amid calls for his impeachment over the Trump-Ukraine scandal where Trump sought to get the Ukrainian president to start an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden. McCarthy wrote that Trump's behavior did not reach the level of impeachable conduct. Previously, McCarthy had written op-eds calling for Hillary Clinton's impeachment before she became president.

At international level, Kizito represented Uganda from 2001 to 2011, having earned 34 caps to his name. Club career In his homeland, Kizito spent four seasons at Villa, helping the club win four consecutive championship titles (2000, 2001, 2002, and 2002‚Äì03) and two Uganda Cups (2000 and 2002). He also won the Kagame Interclub Cup in 2003, before moving abroad. In early 2004, alongside his teammate Phillip Ssozi, Kizito went to Serbia and Montenegro and joined Second League side Srem. He spent the entire year at the club, before earning a transfer to First League side Vojvodina in early 2005. Later that year, Kizito scored the only goal for his team in a 1‚Äì0 win over Red Star Belgrade. He thus helped Vojvodina defeat their rival for the first time in 10 years. Due to his consistent performances throughout the 2005‚Äì06 season, Kizito was voted the Vojvodina Player of the Season by the club's supporters. He continued to play regularly for the side in the following years, amassing over 100 league appearances. In January 2010, Kizito was demoted from the first team after refusing to extend his contract. After becoming a free agent, Kizito signed a two-year contract with Partizan on 2 July 2010. He made his debut for the club 19 days later, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 win away against Armenian champions Pyunik in the second leg of the 2010‚Äì11 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round. During the 2010‚Äì11 Serbian SuperLiga, Kizito recorded 14 appearances, all starts, as the club won the championship title. He also helped his team win the 2010‚Äì11 Serbian Cup, thus collecting the double. In October 2011, Kizito terminated his contract with Partizan by mutual agreement. After returning to his country, Kizito signed for newly promoted Super League side Victoria University in August 2012, penning a one-year deal. He eventually spent the next three years there, before leaving in July 2015. Shortly after, Kizito joined fellow Ugandan club Lweza. International career Kizito made his full international debut for Uganda in 2001. He went on to earn a total of 34 caps for the Cranes over the following decade. In February 2012, Kizito announced his retirement from international football. Personal life A Tanzanian descendant, Kizito was born in Mutukula, Uganda on the Tanzania‚ÄìUganda border.

An advocate of Western Aristotelian thought, his translation of Latin Scholastic writings, brought him into conflict with Hesychasm, the leading school of Byzantine mystical theology, and its most vigorous defender, Gregory Palamas.  Life  Born in the Byzantine city of Thessalonica, Prochoros entered the Great Lavra, a monastery on Mount Athos at a young age, and was eventually ordained a hieromonk. He was greatly influenced by Western Scholasticism. He collaborated with his brother Demetrios Kydones in translating Thomas Aquinas' monumental Summa Theologiae. Prochoros also made Greek translations of the works of Augustine of Hippo and the 6th-century philosopher Boethius. Prochoros' own treatise, De essentia et operatione Dei (‚ÄúOn the Essence and Activity of God‚Äù), was a condemnation of the mystical theology of Hesychasm, propagated by Gregory Palamas. The Synod of Constantinople in 1368 condemned both of the brothers Kydones as heretics, and Prochoros was deposed from the priesthood. The chief source for Prochoros' life is a pair of polemical addresses by Demetrios, eulogizing his brother and denouncing Patriarch Philotheus Kokkinos, who had been responsible for their condemnation.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Kirner Land, whose seat is in the town of Kirn. Geography =Location= B√§renbach lies on the Gro√übach, a short way upstream from where it empties into the river Nahe, and 47.1% of the municipal area is wooded. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, B√§renbach's neighbours are the town of Kirn, the municipality of Heimweiler (both in the Bad Kreuznach district), the town of Idar-Oberstein, the municipality of Fischbach and the municipality of Bergen (all three in the neighbouring Birkenfeld district). History B√§renbach's founding might have come about in that time when the clearing of the so-called j√ºngerer Siedlungsraum (‚Äúnewer settling grounds‚Äù), meaning mainly the near edge of the Soon and the uplands, began in the early 7th century; it was completed by the 12th century. The great importance of this mediaeval clearing process lies in its having been the first time that new land for farming was conquered not by the sword, but rather with the axe. Most new settlements in the woodlands may at first have been only single farms, or at best, groups of homesteads forming the core of a settlement. As late as 1599, B√§renbach still boasted only 12 hearths (for which read ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù or ‚Äúfamilies‚Äù). Data given by H. Kaufmann about the Bad Kreuznach district's placenames show that B√§renbach was mentioned in documents as early as 1108 (‚ÄúGerardus comes de Berenbach‚Äù, UB. Mainz I n. 436). The village's history is tightly bound with the neighbouring Castle Naumburg. In 1146, Raugrave Emicho named ‚ÄúGraf von Nuenburc‚Äù (‚ÄúCount of Naumburg‚Äù), thus giving the castle its first documentary mention. Castle Naumburg (from Neue Burg, meaning ‚ÄúNew Castle‚Äù) likely got its name from being a newer founding than the nearby Kyrburg (another castle) or even the Hachenfels (a now vanished castle). Castle Naumburg stood on a hill near where the B√§renbach (the brook from which the municipality draws its name) empties into the Nahe. It was among the Raugraves‚Äô holdings; this comital house also held further castles and administrative rights on the Alsenz, the Appelbach, the Gro√übach and the Hunsr√ºck. After changes in ownership arrangements, the Raugraves transferred the castle in the 14th century to the Counts of Sponheim-Kreuznach, who made it into the administrative seat of a small Amt comprising the courts of B√§renbach, Becherbach and Martin-Weierbach, along with parts of L√∂llbach and Oberreidenbach. According to a description of the Amt compiled in 1599, the High Court of Becherbach was the hub of the Amt of Naumburg. At the time when the County of Sponheim was partitioned in 1706, the Amt of Naumburg was assigned to the Badish part, then forming the Oberamt of Naumburg, and in 1776, the Amt of Herrstein from the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim was annexed to it. Further, the Imperial-knightly lordship of Martinstein, which belonged to the Margrave of Baden, was administratively tied to the Amt of Naumburg. According to a description of the Amt of Naumburg from 1785, B√§renbach had 32 houses and as many families. One third of B√§renbach's municipal area was lordly domain. The biggest house belonged to the family Nagel, who had long administered the headsman‚Äôs and knacker‚Äôs office. By 1755, Louis George, Margrave of Baden-Baden had pledged his Naumburg landhold against 2,550 Rhenish guilders to 16 families in B√§renbach. During the time of French rule, the pledge was redeemed in favour of the French state. After the family Puricelli had later acquired the pledge at auction, it was only in 1855 that 22 B√§renbach families had lands transferred to them against a payment of 7,200 Rhenish guilders. During the French occupation of the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, B√§renbach belonged to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Schmidthachenbach, the Canton of Grumbach and the Department of Sarre. It was also under French rule that the building complexes at the Naumburg were torn down. Under the terms laid down by the Congress of Vienna after the Napoleonic Wars had ended, a new political order was established, which at first saw B√§renbach placed under Prussian administration in 1815. Soon thereafter, however, sometime in 1816 or 1817, the village found itself ruled by Hesse- Homburg, within which it became part of the Oberschulthei√üerei, and later B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù), of Becherbach. Only in 1821 did the municipality build itself its own church, to which Schmidthachenbach was later, in 1903, added as a vicariate. Until this church was built, B√§renbach had always belonged to the parish of Becherbach. Until 1866, the B√ºrgermeisterei of Becherbach belonged to the Oberamt of Meisenheim, which was subject to the Landgraves of Hesse-Homburg. In the time that followed, Becherbach remained a local administrative seat when in 1869 the new Prussian Meisenheim district was newly formed out of the former Oberamt. In 1932, the Meisenheim district was dissolved and its lands were merged into the Bad Kreuznach district. Eight years later, by which time Adolf Hitler and the Nazis had not only founded the Third Reich but also started the Second World War, the Amt of Becherbach was dissolved in the course of administrative reform and then merged into the Amt of Kirn-Land. From this time, Kirn became the hub for all administrative functions for the citizens of B√§renbach. Since the latest administrative reform, in 1969 and 1970, B√§renbach has been part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land.History =Municipality‚Äôs name= About the derivation of the name ‚ÄúB√§renbach‚Äù there is no consensus. There are two other villages in Rhineland-Palatinate alone with this same name (this one, for one). If interpreted as a Modern High German word, its meaning would be ‚ÄúBear‚Äôs Brook‚Äù, but the modern spelling may not be indicative of the name's etymology. Decisive for the interpretation is the first syllable, which ‚Äì as also with the village of B√§rweiler ‚Äì was originally Ber‚Äî (Berenbach/Berwilre). In Middle High German usage, this syllable had several meanings and was applied to not only the bear (B√§r in Modern High German) but also the breeding boar (in which case it was cognate with the still current English word boarEtymology and cognates of ‚Äúboar‚Äù) and even barley (in which case it was cognate with the Old English word bere, which helped give rise to the modern word barleyEtymology and cognates of ‚Äúbarley‚Äù), now called Gerste in German. At times, placename researchers lean towards the interpretation of the name having sprung from the brown bear, which once roamed this area. It seems much likelier, though, that the name is drawn from a personal or family name. Many placenames after all go back to a village's owner, founder or leader, with the village that grows up drawing its name from a homestead that once stood there. If so, B√§renbach might have drawn its name from a man named Bero, a short form of the name Berengar.Municipality‚Äôs name Religion As at 31 July 2013, there are 504 full-time residents in B√§renbach, and of those, 311 are Evangelical (61.706%), 116 are Catholic (23.016%), 14 (2.778%) belong to other religious groups and 63 (12.5%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= B√§renbach's mayor is J√ºrgen Schmidt, and his deputies are Alfred Litzenburger and Herbert Bangert.B√§renbach‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess abased vert a bend sinister wavy couped at the line of partition and a berry couped in pale, both argent, and chequy of eighteen azure and Or. These are canting arms, referring as they do to the municipality's name. The two charges in the upper field are the canting elements referring to the two parts of the name, a berry (Beere in German) for the name prefix and the wavy bend sinister (slanted stripe) standing for a brook (Bach in German). Some old descriptions record the village's name as Beerenbach, which literally does mean ‚ÄúBerrybrook‚Äù. This would have been pronounced slightly differently from the current name, with the first vowel a bit higher, more an [eÀê] than the current […õÀê]. The tincture vert (green) was chosen for two local dales. The lower field is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim. Municipal council gave the graphic artist Brust from Kirn-Sulzbach the task of designing a municipal coat of arms on 8 October 1963. At a council meeting on 6 May 1964, council adopted the design that had been put forth. After consent by the state archive, the Ministry of the Interior in Mainz granted approval for B√§renbach to bear its own arms on 12 May 1965.Description and explanation of B√§renbach‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district Naumburg castle ruin * Evangelical church, Hauptstra√üe 31 ‚Äì aisleless church, marked 1821, widened 1967/1968 * Hauptstra√üe 46 ‚Äì former Spielmannsm√ºhle (mill), estate complex; combination house and mill, marked 1763, barn with half-hip roof, marked 1834 and 1748 * Unterdorfstra√üe 2 ‚Äì timber-frame house, 17th century * Castle Naumburg ruinLandkreis Bad Kreuznach: Inhaltsverzeichnis des Kreisrechtes, abgerufen am 31.

Named in this deal were, among other things, an estate at Hausen and holdings in the villages of Buntenbach (Bundenbach), Blickersaue (Blickersau ‚Äì now vanished) and Wapenroth (Woppenroth). The people on the estate at Hausen who were from outside the village were to be divided by the road that ran from Meisenheim to the Langenstein (near B√§rweiler), then to Hostede (Hochst√§tten), and thence by the road Veldencia (Veldenz) by way of Runa (Rhaunen), on by the old mill to Lauferswilre (Laufersweiler) and Enckerich (Enkirch). Everybody who lived east of this road, on towards the Rhine, was to be assigned to Waldgrave Emich, whereas everybody who lived west thereof, on towards the forests, was to be assigned to Waldgrave Gottfried. On 6 December 1363, B√§rweiler had its first documentary mention in an agreement that was reached on that day: Waldgrave Friedrich von Kyrburg was to allow the knights Johann Fust, Lamprecht and Conrad, Brothers of Stromberg, the rental rights that had been sold them, after four years had gone by. The rights were herein bound to fiefs at Berwilre (B√§rweiler). The requirement was that the persons named would have paid up to that point 220 tornesels (silver Groschen). If they could not pay off the corn rental rights within four years, then the knights Henrich and Rudwin, along with Siegfried, Brothers of Stromberg, or their feudal heirs or Lords Konrad and Emrich (also knights), Brothers of Mirksheim (Merxheim) could do so. On 14 February 1375, Thilman, Lord at Heyntzenberg (Heinzenberg), sold Otto, Waldgrave at Kirburg, and his wife Agnes many holdings, which were listed by name, in Lympach (Limbach), Berwilre (B√§rweiler), Leylbach (L√∂llbach), Schwinscheit (Schweinschied), Seibach, Syende, Nieder-Meckenbach, Medersheym (Meddersheim), Meckenbach and Oberhondsbach among other places. From B√§rweiler, a man named ‚ÄúWilhelm von Berwilre‚Äù was mentioned. Even as far back as 1377, the Langenstein (a local menhir) was mentioned in a Weistum (cognate with English wisdom, this was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) dealing with the Kirner Marktmeile (‚ÄúKirn Market Mile‚Äù, actually a boundary description). The pertinent passage from the Weistum reads as follows (in archaic German): > Dis ist die martmyle und get an zu Oberhosenbach an dem cruze, und gein > Wapenrot an den lichten bule, und vort gein Sessebach an die velse, von dort > zu Viller an die Ruhe und vort gein Berwiller an den langen Stein, von > dannen an Lympachs crutz und vort gein Perich an den hane‚Ä¶ In translation, this comes out as follows: > This is the market mile and (it) goes on to Oberhosenbach at the cross, and > towards Woppenroth at the gentle rise, and forth towards Seesbach at the > crag, from there to Weiler at the rest spot and forth towards B√§rweiler at > the Long Stone (that is, the menhir), from there to Limbach‚Äôs cross and > forth towards Perich at the grove‚Ä¶ The Weistum only mentions the main points (among which Perich is a bit of a mystery) of the boundary of a zone within which high jurisdiction over robbers and murderers was subject to the Waldgraves as the landholders. In other words, they held the power to pronounce even the harshest sentences upon such wrongdoers. More precise clues as to the village of B√§rweiler, however, are found only in the 14th century, although the village, and also its name, might well be quite a bit older. B√§rweiler was a lordship that was the Kyrburg part of a joint holding (Ganerbenschaft) as a Waldgravial Burgmann‚Äôs fief. Among the knightly families, the Fauste von Stromberg and the Fauste von Merxheim were recorded, among others. On 19 April 1382, the brothers Johann and Brenner von Stromberg sold their share of the village, court and people at Berwilre with its appurtenances, whereby bit by bit their titles in B√§rweiler would, by sale, one by one, pass back to the Waldgraves. According to the old Mannbuch (literally ‚Äúman book‚Äù, a kind of register book of enfeoffments) in Coesfeld, Lamprecht Fuste von Stromberg held a claim on 24 Malter in corn (likely either wheat or rye) rent in B√§rweiler.13th and 14th centuries =15th century= On 26 July 1412, Johann Waldgrave at Dunen (Dhaun) and at Kirburg gave Rorich von Merxheim a holding in pledge to free up 100 Rhenish guilders. Furthermore, the document established that the right to redeem the pledge existed for Brenner von Stromberg and Waldgrave Johann. Johann held the stronger hand. The pledged estates were thus Waldgrave Johann‚Äôs fief. The lordly dominium directum over three villages in the area of the Heidenweistum had from yore belonged to the Counts of Veldenz: Hundsbach, Merzweiler and Nieder-Eisenbach. According to the old Veldenz Mannbuch, Johann Boos von Waldeck held the following fiefs on 11 February 1417: his share of the Hundeszbach (Hundsbach) court, people, taxes (public-lawful levies), rental (general payment mainly from harvests) and whatever belonged thereto as well as a share in the freedom of action at Huntsbach (Hundsbach), Berwilre (B√§rweiler), Merxheim, Mederszheim (Meddersheim) and Langenhard (vanished village of Langert near B√§rweiler). On 21 April 1422, Johann and Philipp, Brothers Boos von Waldeck acquired as fiefs, among other things, once again Hondiszbach (Hundsbach), the village and the court, with the appurtaining people, taxes, rental and freedom of action at Hondiszbach, Berwilre and other places. On 13 September 1426, an agreement was concluded with Brenner von Stromberg as to the village and the court at Berwilre with appurtenances. Lamprecht Fust von Stromberg on 13 May 1427 imposed a yearly corn rental of 24 Malter in B√§rweiler as part of the Kyrburg fief that he held. On 9 February 1432, Hermann Boos von Waldeck appeared in another document. He arranged a widow‚Äôs fund for his wife Schonette von Sien of 10 Rhenish guilders from the fief that he held from Friedrich Count of Veldenz, among other things, in Hundsbach, at Luschet (Lauschied) and at Berwiler (B√§rweiler) the people who were assigned to his Schulthei√ü, Fogler. On 7 July 1434, the yearly corn rental of 24 Malter went to Johann Fuste and on 27 December 1457, to Lamprecht Fuste von Stromberg as a pledged fief from the Lordship of Kyrburg. About 1460, B√§rweiler was mentioned in the court and border Weistum dealing with the Heidengericht (‚ÄúHeath Court‚Äù) at Sien or the state court in the Winterhauch (an upland south and southeast of Idar- Oberstein). The conspicuous Langenstein once again served as a border marker. To this day, border markings can still be found on the cliffs behind the village, if one climbs over the cliffs from the north over a little natural bridge. These 12 cm-in-diameter, 10 cm-deep markings have been wrongly interpreted as ‚Äúbasins‚Äù and associated with a sacrifice cult and similar phenomena. In fact, they are nothing more than 13th- and 14th-century border markers. They defined points on the border in the Middle Ages before the cross was introduced as a border sign.century =16th century= Before the 1515 partition, B√§rweiler ‚Äì along with Kirn, Sulzbach, Desloch, Niederhundsbach and Oberhundsbach ‚Äì belonged to the Waldgravial Amt of Kyrburg. In the 16th century, the tithe was due the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. In the way that was typical for this family, the Waldgravine and Rhinegravine Anna von Kyrburg, according to a 1542 sworn statement by the gatherers of the T√ºrkensteuer (‚ÄúTurk tax‚Äù, imposed in the Holy Roman Empire ostensibly to help the Emperor ward off the ‚ÄúTurkish threat‚Äù), had lent out church holdings and assumed the lease herself. She also held the right to appoint the parish priest. Presumably, the clergyman posted to the designated chapel was paid (1507). In 1515, there was a division of Waldgravial-Rhinegravial holdings between Waldgraves and Rhinegraves Philipp (von Dhaun) and Johann VII (von Kyrburg), both Waldgrave and Rhinegrave Johann VI‚Äôs sons, who in 1499 had succeeded their father as his rightful successors. Also reaching the present day from that time is this extract from another Weistum, the B√§rweiler Kyrburg Amt Weistum (Berwyler Kirberger ampts wystum): > Scholtes und scheffen doselbst wy√üen und herkennen u.(unseren) gn.(√§digen) > h.(erren) die Ringrafen wilcher Kirberg inhait, vor obergeriechtshern uf der > syten nach der kirchen zu und uf der syten do auch die kirch uf stete; die > ander syten setzen sie uf die lehenbrief, so die Fust haben, dieselbigen zu > besiechten, ob sie der syten geriechtshern sint oder nit, menlichem sins > rechten unverlustig. Ir wystum ist gar irrig, deshalb nit dann wie itz > gehort ufgeschr. Fron wi√üen sie denen die uf u. gn. h. syten zum jar eyn > mail ghen Kyrberg und pacht und frucht auch schuldig dar zu foren. In translation, this comes out as follows: > Schulthei√ü and Sch√∂ffen (roughly ‚Äúlay jurists‚Äù) thereat know and recognize > our kind lords the Rhinegraves who hold Kyrburg for chief lords of the court > on the side towards the churches and on the side where the church stands; > the other side they set out in the letter of enfeoffment, thus the Fusts > have to see to it whether they are that side‚Äôs court lords or not, if they > are not to forfeit their rights. Their wisdom is quite wrong, thus then not > as now heard written up. In lordly manner they know to whom what on our kind > lords‚Äô side are also owing towards Kyrburg once a year and the lease and > fruit there. From this Weistum it is clear that even in the 16th century, besides the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves, the Fuste von Stromberg, too, still held rights in B√§rweiler. Consequently, not only was the village split into two shares by ownership, but taxpaying was likewise not all to the same authority. The church at that time (now Evangelical) served as an orientation point in the matter of the ownership relations in the divided village. When the family Merxheim died out in 1440, the Fuste raised a claim on the succession to the Ganerbenschaft, which not surprisingly led to a dispute between them and the Waldgraves, which was still not settled by 1508. Only in 1556 did the said parties‚Äô descendants redeem the amount of 24 Malter of corn. Nonetheless, the disagreements continued until 1581. A document from 13 July of that year mentions Philipp Reichardt Fust von Stromberg as the holder of the lordship over the fief at Berweiler. In 1589, there was a boundary survey between B√§rweiler and Meddersheim, which was cited in a later dispute over the two municipalities‚Äô municipal areas. On hand at the Kirn town archive are extracts about taxes from 1589 to 1606 that the village of B√§rweiler had to pay yearly to the bursar in Kyrburg.16th century =17th century= During the Reformation, the church in B√§rweiler was raised to parish church. In 1605, the then pastor Melchior Beerwein tried unsuccessfully to return to the customs of widow‚Äôs estates and using the churchyard. Little is known about what happened in B√§rweiler during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), but it is known that this war swept through the land with all its ferocity. In 1620, Spanish troops took, after Kreuznach, Simmern and B√∂ckelheim, also Sobernheim. From 1631 to 1632, the Swedes ‚Äúfreed‚Äù the Nahe region. In 1639, too, the Swedes marched through the land, in 1641 once again the Spaniards and then in 1644 the French. The old road from Mainz by way of Tholey to Metz touched B√§rweiler‚Äôs municipal area right nearby. A document kept at the state archive at Koblenz tells of a battle near B√§rweiler ‚Äì partly within what are now municipal limits ‚Äì at the Schwarzenberg. It was apparently quite bloody, but no exact date ‚Äì not even the year ‚Äì has been recorded. This is what it says: > ‚Ä¶is to prove that in the Thirty Years‚Äô War a battle between the Swedish and > opposed nations was held on the Schwartzenberg, at which many people > remained, who on the kind lordship‚Äôs orders had to be buried by people from > Meddersheim and Kirschroth‚Ä¶ 17th century =18th century= On 17 December 1709, ‚ÄúCarl, Waldgrave at Dhaun Kirburg, Rhinegrave at the Stein, Count at Salm, Lord at Vinstingen and P√ºttlingen‚Äù let his estate, which lay within B√§rweiler‚Äôs limits, to the Lauschied Schulthei√ü, Johann Michel Hoffmann, for a term of 18 years. This deal held true not only for Hoffmann himself, but in case of his death, also for his wife and any heirs. The lease was to expire in 1728. It was furthermore set forth that Hoffmann was to do the following: > jedes Jahr umb Martini davon uns entrichtet an Pfacht neun Mltr. halb Korn > und halb habern in hiesiger Ma√ü. Translated, this would be: > each year about Michaelmas thereof pay us in rent nine Malter of half corn > and half oats in local measurements. In the early 18th century, B√§rweiler twice drew a grim lot in a short time. In both 1710 and 1719, a great part of the village burnt down. Pastor Webner wrote the following about the 1710 fire in the church chronicle: > Many old men still remember having heard from their parents that this > village burnt down twice, about which the confirmation is to be found in the > Evangelical community‚Äôs 1711‚Äì1754 church book deposited at the > Oberschulthei√üerei at Merxheim. ‚Ä¶ The story goes that the whole village > burnt down, that the pastor‚Äôs dwelling at least was among those buildings > burnt down, and thus the pastor of Abtweiler had to conduct church services > in the interim, although without a church, since that had also burnt down. > Furthermore, that church book likewise bears witness in the marriage > register, where it says: Ao. 1714 30 October Johann Adam Greulach ‚Ä¶ married > at the reduced-to-ashes church. A short time later, Webner wrote the following about the 1719 fire: > The second fire that struck Berweiler broke out on 14 May 1719 on Rogation > Sunday right after church services towards nine o‚Äôclock in the morning. The > church was thus built again, likely in 1715 or 1716, because no further note > can be found about the burnt-out church.

In the > uppermost house, where Jacob Hofmann currently lives, the owner Philipp > Schnell, along with his wife and 14-year-old son, lost their lives. They > were found suffocated in the cellar. By these misfortunes the community was > quite shattered. To build the houses again, the woodlands were cut down, and > the many important debts that were made were inherited by children and > grandchildren. Even fruit trees were cut down for building wood. In 1745, official acts at Schlo√ü Anholt on 28 February and at Dhaun on 24 March yielded documents stating that Christian Otto, Waldgrave at Dhaun and Kyrburg, Rhinegrave at the Stein, Count at Salm, Lord of Vinstingen, P√ºttlingen and Dimmeringen had received, among other things, the Faust fief at Beerweiler along with many other rights to tithes and clergy appointments in other villages, for they had all passed back to him. In 1750, the younger line of Dhaun died out. In the Waldgravial-Rhinegravial territory, the Catholic line of Salm-Kyrburg gained ever greater influence. Prince Johann Dominik took over the government. Unlike any other Waldgrave-Rhinegrave, he cared for his subjects‚Äô welfare and for the enhancement of the people‚Äôs education. Not only in Kirn did he have many buildings built and maintained (for example the Piarist monastery and the College), but also in the villages of his Oberamt, where many churches and schools arose through his efforts. In B√§rweiler at that time, both a Catholic church and a Catholic school were brought into being. Until the French occupation of the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank towards the end of the 18th century, B√§rweiler belonged to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves at Kyrburg. This princely lordship ended in 1792 with the conquest of the Nahe region by French Revolutionary troops. Until October 1795, France busied itself at taking over these lands and incorporating them into its territory. In the course of this takeover, the Canton of Meisenheim was created, to which B√§rweiler belonged.18th century =19th century= After the end of Napoleonic rule, introduced by the Battle of Leipzig (‚ÄúBattle of the Nations‚Äù; 16 to 18 October 1813), the Kingdom of Prussia annexed the territory south of the Nahe. After the Treaty of Paris (30 May 1814), the region between the Rhine and the Moselle on the one side and the French border on the other ‚Äì an area within which lay B√§rweiler ‚Äì was jointly ruled by the Emperor of Austria and the King of Bavaria. After only two years, the rulers ceded the Canton of Meisenheim to the Landgraves of Hesse-Homburg. In the late 19th century, B√§rweiler saw its administrative arrangements change several times. Beginning in 1869, the municipality was part of the Meisenheim district, after having belonged from 1816 to the Hesse-Homburg Oberamt of Meisenheim until 1866, when it was joined to Prussia‚Äôs Rhine Province, and within that to the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz. When industrialization began in the region towards the end of the 19th century, B√§rweiler took no part in it, for then there was no good transport link with the Nahe valley. B√§rweiler thus remained purely an agrarian village.19th century =20th century= In the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), all male villagers who were capable of fighting were called into the forces. A memorial in the village shows that twelve of them fell. The war‚Äôs outbreak cut deeply into B√§rweiler‚Äôs fabric. The reeve at that time, Philipp Karl Hofmann, put together a wartime chronicle of the village of B√§rweiler. Unfortunately, the entries only run from the war‚Äôs onset up to November 1917. His writings tell of not only the economic effects that the Great War had on the village, but also the social ones. About the outbreak of the war, he wrote: > When on 2 August 1914 the mobilization became known by telephone also in our > village, one of the consequences was of enthusiasm among the villagers for > all members of the army hurrying bravely to the flag. The authorities found > themselves in such difficulties that they could only deal with them all by > working day and night and with effort. On the other hand, the same writer‚Äôs tone was quite different in this later entry when writing of the same event: > Hard times. When‚Ä¶ in the last days of July 1914 the state of war‚Ä¶ hung over > Germany‚Ä¶ By the telephone news, our villagers, too, ended up in horror and > great sensation ‚Ä¶ The people were in the field cutting corn when suddenly > the surprising news came and everybody, in the middle of what they were > doing, hurried home deeply moved, gathered in the streets and complained to > each other about what the future had yet to bring us. When shortly > thereafter on 2 August, the unforgettable day, the first day of > mobilization, the news came telegraphically, that our Fatherland was being > threatened all around by a wave of foes. The Lord God will lead us through > hard times to victory, and bestow upon our Fatherland once more golden > peace. The Minister of the Interior made an appeal to the rural population to take in, as far as was possible, children from cities and industrial centres. In 1917 alone, 12 such children were sheltered in B√§rweiler, and in 1918, five. Throughout the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Meddersheim, according to Mayor Weyrauch‚Äôs figures, it was 15 in 1917 and 58 in 1918. About it, he wrote: > The children looked upon meeting them very wretched, pale and emaciated‚Ä¶ > Anyway, the stay agreed with the town children very well, for, chipper and > strengthened they could after a few weeks go back home. Towards the end of the war, there was in B√§rweiler, as there was in neighbouring villages, much billeting of German troop units coming back from the fighting. This first modern war of the 20th century also took tribute from B√§rweiler. The wartime chronicle kept from 1914 to 1917 indicates that up to that time, eight villagers who went to the fighting received the Iron Cross, although by then, as many had also fallen, and eleven had been wounded. All together, twelve men from B√§rweiler fell in the First World War.20th century Weimar Republic The first twelve years of the Weimar Republic were in the Rhineland a time of French occupation. In June 1920, a shooting range (Champ de tir de Kirn) was set up near Merxheim. Between 5 and 11 July, in the area among Merxheim, Meckenbach, Krebsweiler, Heimbach, Limbach, Kirschroth, Meddersheim and on the Nahe‚Äôs banks from Merxheim to Sobernheim, artillery exercises were conducted. B√§rweiler‚Äôs municipal area bordered in the southeast on the restricted area. B√§rweiler was, at least in the beginning, more heavily affected by the shooting range. In the time from 21 to 27 August 1920, the French artillery once more conducted live shooting exercises at the troop drilling ground. Part of B√§rweiler‚Äôs municipal area also lay in the danger zone. Some 60 ha of it was affected. In September 1920, 12 ha of land was to be sown with winter grain and another 10 with potatoes. After an order from the French general of the Rhine Army, the live shooting exercises were restricted to Sundays, Mondays and Fridays until noon. Thus, the farmers raising the aforesaid crops could use the rest of that time to tend them. Otherwise, the Merxheim shooting range did not affect life in B√§rweiler much at all. Most neighbouring villages, on the other hand, from 1919 to 1920 and in later years, had to put up with billeting of a great number of occupational troops when exercises were being conducted. In the 1920s, not only the clubs offered opportunities for communication but also as gathering places there were one or two inns. Only in 1928/1929 was the first kermis (church consecration festival, locally known as the Kerb) after the war held. Unlike what happened in the cities, the high unemployment that characterized the 1920s in Germany had no direct effects in B√§rweiler. Many family members could find modest livelihoods in farming or forestry (for example in barking). Many women and girls from B√§rweiler, Hundsbach, Lauschied and other villages lived ‚Äúin the beggarliest circumstances‚Äù. Even the Ewald gelatine works was short of manpower.Weimar Republic Third Reich and Second World War As in other places in Germany, a ‚ÄúHitler Oak‚Äù was planted in B√§rweiler right after Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power. It stood near today‚Äôs warriors‚Äô memorial. The National Socialist r√©gime‚Äôs Gleichschaltung set in right after the seizure of power and even in the smallest villages, it did not spare club life. The warriors‚Äô club still staged memorial celebrations for those who had fallen in the First World War. The church and singing club participated in these as well. As elsewhere, the warriors‚Äô club quickly submitted itself to Nazi ideology: ‚ÄúThe warriors‚Äô club, in the spring of 1933, always participated fully and wholly in the celebration of the National Rising of our people.‚Äù The youth ‚Äì an important factor in Nazi power politics ‚Äì were drawn in from the beginning, even in B√§rweiler. Youthful membership in clubs and other organizations thereby virtually ceased to exist. Documents were compiled as to who had joined which mass Nazi organization, and when (that is, the Hitler Youth, the League of German Girls, the Deutsches Jungvolk or whatever). Although on 1 September 1939 only three or four men from the village went to the war, later all men capable of fighting were called into the Wehrmacht, which amounted to 68 men, and that meant at least one man from almost every household. As early as the spring of 1940, bombs fell within B√§rweiler‚Äôs municipal limits for the first time, among them one demolition bomb and several incendiaries. They did no damage to the village itself, although the craters were still visible long after the war. B√§rweiler was mostly spared Allied bombings as the war wore on. The war‚Äôs consequences were harsh: Of 74 men who went away to fight, 17 did not return. To this day, eight local soldiers‚Äô fates are unknown. One family lost three sons, while several others each lost two. The last to return was a man who had been held in the Soviet Union and who arrived back home on 7 December 1949. The population‚Äôs supply of everyday goods was at this time worse than it had been during the war. Rationing was still the rule. Until early 1948, food rationing cards were still in use.Third Reich Since the Second World War After the 1948 currency reform, a measure of normalcy began to return to village life. In 1949, B√§rweiler began holding kermises again. A year later, the gymnastic club was refounded. Since the club had no apparatus at its disposal, it produced two theatrical plays each winter. The admission was 1 DM for each playgoer and the proceeds were used to buy new gymnastic apparatus. The first mayor after the war was Willi Kistner, who was chosen by municipal decision. He remained in office for three years. In 1950, B√§rweiler had 420 inhabitants, a peak for the 20th century. It can be explained by the presence in the village at that time of 12 Germans driven out of Germany‚Äôs former eastern territories and other refugees. Moreover, people who had lost homes to bombing in the cities temporarily sought shelter in B√§rweiler. Once their dwellings had been reconstructed or repaired, these people mostly went back to their towns and their jobs. Only a few of the refugees stayed in B√§rweiler or neighbouring villages.Since the Second World War Several medals from the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village should become lovelier‚Äù) bear witness to the successful village renewal measures, which have made B√§rweiler into a showplace over the last 20 years.Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden =Jewish history= B√§rweiler once had a small Jewish community that was actually an outlying part of the Jewish community in Hundsbach. See the relevant sections of that article for the community‚Äôs history and information about its synagogue. Religion As at 31 December 2012, there are 246 full-time residents in B√§rweiler, and of those, 176 are Evangelical (71.545%), 30 are Catholic (12.195%), 2 (0.813%) belong to other religious groups and 38 (15.447%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= B√§rweiler‚Äôs mayor is Hans Gehm, and his deputies are Horst Scherer and Rainer Matzke.B√§rweiler‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: In Rot-Gold geschachten Schild eine schwarze Spitze, belegt mit goldenem L√∂wenkopf. The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Chequy gules and Or a pile transposed sable charged with a lion‚Äôs head erased of the second langued of the first. The village of B√§rweiler was a fief from the Waldgraviate in the family Stromberg‚Äôs and the family von Merxheim‚Äôs hands as a Ganerbschaft (a kind of condominium). In 1382, part of the village and the court found its way into the hands of Waldgraves Otto and Friedrich at Kyrburg. In 1461, ‚ÄúFust‚Äù von Stromberg acquired his cousin Syffryt von Stromberg‚Äôs fief. The Waldgraves of Kyrburg bore arms gules three lions Or (a red shield with three gold lions). Fust (Faust) von Stromberg bore arms chequy gules and Or (with a chequered pattern, with alternating squares of red and gold). The ‚Äúchequy‚Äù pattern in these arms thus symbolizes the link to the Lords of Stromberg. The ‚Äúpile transposed‚Äù (the wedge-shaped element) symbolizes the Langenstein (local menhir), while the charge thereon, the lion‚Äôs head, is a reference to the village‚Äôs former allegiance to the Waldgraves of Kyrburg.Description and explanation of B√§rweiler‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Evangelical church, Neugasse 3 ‚Äì aisleless church, essentially Gothic (before 1509), remodelled about 1800, expanded 1955/1956 * Saint John the Baptist‚Äôs Catholic Church (Kirche St. Johann Baptist), Hauptstra√üe 12 ‚Äì Late Baroque aisleless church, quarrystone, 1770, Court Master Builder Johann Thomas Petri * Hauptstra√üe 19 ‚Äì former bakehouse, possibly from the 17th century * Hauptstra√üe 45 ‚Äì former school; villalike two-part Heimatstil building, marked 1913 * Vordergasse 8 ‚Äì estate complex; stable-house, marked 1887; dwelling, partly timber-frame, earlier half of the 19th century; house, mid 19th century * Jewish graveyard, near Judenkopf (monumental zone) ‚Äì witnessed in 1824 to 1886; two gravestones and two pedestals =Sport and leisure= Hiking trails around B√§rweiler and to the Langenstein (local menhir) invite hikers to view and explore the village.Sport and leisure Economy and infrastructure =Transport= To the north runs Bundesstra√üe 41.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Meisenheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. Becherbach should not be confused with Becherbach bei Kirn, which lies in the same district. Geography =Location= Becherbach lies in the Palatinate south of Meisenheim and east of Lauterecken. Nearby towns are the district seat, Bad Kreuznach, which lies 24 km to the northeast, Birkenfeld, lying 35 km to the west and Kaiserslautern, lying 23 km to the south. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Becherbach's neighbours are the municipality of Reiffelbach, the municipality of Schmittweiler (both in the Bad Kreuznach district), the municipality of Waldgrehweiler (in the Donnersbergkreis), the municipality of Nu√übach, the municipality of Reipoltskirchen, the municipality of Ginsweiler, the municipality of Adenbach and the municipality of Odenbach (all in the Kusel district). =Constituent communities= Becherbach's Ortsteile are the main village, also called Becherbach (roughly 550 inhabitants), and also Gangloff (some 275 inhabitants) and Roth (some 275 inhabitants). Also belonging to the main village are the outlying homesteads of Kirnbuscherhof, R√∂merhof and Rothenbaumerhof.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 15 (PDF; 2,16 MB) History =Antiquity= Archaeological finds from the New Stone Age have been made in Gangloff and Roth. The Roman linking road between Bad Kreuznach and Otterberg led by way of the Rossberg near Becherbach and Gangloff. A sideroad off this thoroughfare leading to Odenbach ran between Becherbach and Roth. The path running through this area is known to this day as the R√∂merstra√üe (‚ÄúRoman road‚Äù). Found on the Rossberg's summit were three block- shaped stones that were dedicated to Mercury and his mother Maia, two Roman coins and tiles and a stamp. These finds have all been lost. In the village church, a Roman gravestone was found. Unearthed at the Gangloff graveyard was a Vierg√∂tterstein (a ‚Äúfour-god stone‚Äù, a pedestal on which a Jupiter Column was customarily stood). No Roman finds have come to light in Roth. =Middle Ages= The whole of what is now the municipality of Becherbach lay under the Counts of Veldenz, and after they died out, under the House of Wittelsbach (the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken and later the Kingdom of Bavaria). =Modern times= Becherbach long lay on the border between two states: Meisenheim, which at an earlier time (as also once again today) had been placed above Becherbach as an administrative seat, belonged between the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and Germany's more recent division into Bundesl√§nder in 1946 to Prussia, or before 1866 to the Landgraviate of Hesse- Homburg. The border was thus only some 7 to 9 km away from the three villages that today make up the municipality of Becherbach. The NSDAP Ortsgruppe (‚Äúlocal group‚Äù) in Becherbach was founded in October 1927 by Emil Gauer, a Nazi politician, born in Becherbach, who was later installed as the ideologically true mayor of Pirmasens in 1937, serving until his arrest by the Americans in 1945. Between 1928 and 1933, the NSDAP's electoral successes in the local area were greater than the average for the Weimar Republic. The Antisemitic newspaper, Der St√ºrmer, however, wrote in April 1936 that the populace of Odenbach, Becherbach and the surrounding area were to some extent still ‚Äústrongly vernagelt (variously translated as ‚Äústubborn‚Äù, ‚Äúnarrowminded‚Äù or ‚Äúslow-witted‚Äù) and behind the moon (roughly ‚Äúbehind the times‚Äù)‚Äù. This arose from a Jewish woman‚Äôs burial that was attended by various inhabitants ‚Äì whom Der St√ºrmer named in the article ‚Äì of the villages mentioned. In 1954, Becherbach got its first watermain, and thereby took its first step towards modernization. The Ortsgemeinde that exists today came into being on 7 June 1969 through the merger of three hitherto self-administering municipalities: Becherbach/Pfalz (532 inhabitants), Gangloff (270 inhabitants) and Roth (274 inhabitants). At the same time, Becherbach was transferred from the Kusel district to the Bad Kreuznach district.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis 2006 , Seiten 162, 170 (PDF; 2,03 MB) Mining Under Duke Wolfgang of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, the so-called ‚ÄúOdenbach Seam‚Äù (coal) was discovered, which was worked in, among other places, Reiffelbach. Within what is today the municipality of Becherbach, the seam was exploited only in the villages of Gangloff and Roth. The mine in Roth was linked to the one in Odenbach by an underground gallery, while a similar arrangement linked the Hollerbach mine near Roth to the one in Reiffelbach. There was, however, no such link between the two local mines. In 1799 in Becherbach itself (now the main centre of the merged municipality), a limestone mine was worked on the south slopes towards Reipoltskirchen. Cache of explosives and consequent evacuation On 22 January 2011, Becherbach's (the main village's) whole population had to be evacuated from their homes for 16 hours when a local barn was found to contain, according to Der Spiegel, a ‚Äútruckload‚ÄùA ‚Äútruckload‚Äù of ordnance of machine guns, hand grenades and a great amount of explosives. A police spokesman said that it was ‚Äúpresumably‚Äù the greatest amount of explosives ever found in the country in a private citizen's hands.S√ºddeutsche.de: Dorf in Rheinland-Pfalz evakuiert - Scheune voller Sprengstoff, 22. Januar 2011Becherbach: Erste kontrollierte Sprengung erfolgreich auf swr.de vom 22. Januar 2011 It was roughly 50 kg. Authorities disposed of the explosives in controlled explosions on a nearby farm lane, deploying a remote-controlled robot to move the material. The detonations could be heard 10 km away. S√ºdwestrundfunk reported that the explosive in question was nitroglycerine. The unlawful owner of the material was a 62-year-old Hundsbach man identified as ‚ÄúKurt N.‚Äù ‚Äì and nicknamed ‚ÄúPulver-Kurt‚Äù (‚ÄúPowder Kurt‚Äù) by the locals ‚Äì who was then investigated for breach of the Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz (‚ÄúWar Weapon Control Law‚Äù) and subsequently charged and tried. The magazine Bild reported that Kurt liked to wear a uniform with SS insignia, and that there were photographs of his friends who were similarly heavily armed.Evacuation due to explosivesEvacuation due to explosives Upon conviction, he was sentenced on 21 August 2012 to three and a half years in prison without parole (six months short of what the prosecutor had demanded).‚ÄúPulver-Kurt‚Äôs‚Äù sentence =Municipality‚Äôs name= The name Becherbach is believed to stem from either the pitch makers (Pech is ‚Äúpitch‚Äù in German) or the beaker makers (Becher is ‚Äúbeaker‚Äù in German, while in Palatine German, it is a word that means ‚Äúbeaker maker‚Äù) who worked here in bygone days. The name Gangloff comes from Saint Gangulphus of Burgundy. Roth is a name that crops up often in Germany, and it refers to a clearing. Religion Becherbach's inhabitants are mainly Evangelical. Becherbach has belonged since 1975 to the ecclesiastical community of Odenbach, which in turn belongs ‚Äì as one of its northernmost communities ‚Äì to the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate. As at 31 July 2013, there are 880 full-time residents in Becherbach, and of those, 708 are Evangelical (80.455%), 67 are Catholic (7.614%), one (0.114%) belongs to the Freireligi√∂se Landesgemeinde Pfalz (‚ÄúPalatinate Free Religious State Community‚Äù), 6 (0.682%) belong to other religious groups and 98 (11.136%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Becherbach's mayor is Manfred Denzer, who succeeded Wolfgang Paulus, who had been in office since 1991, in 2009. Both men's political affiliation is with the SPD. =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Or a beacon sable inflamed gules. The arms came into being in 1952 and are canting arms for, at least, one of the municipality's supposed namesakes, the pitch gatherers, for the only charge in the arms, a flaming beacon, is known in German as a Pechkorb (literally ‚Äúpitch basket‚Äù). The tinctures gules and Or (red and gold) are those once borne by Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. Roth's unofficial arms show a tree standing on a three-knolled hill (a charge called a Dreiberg in German heraldry) flanked by crossed miner's hammers on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side and a ploughshare on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side. Gangloff has no arms, unofficial or otherwise, but the St. Gangolf Pipes & Drums club (bagpipes) has a coat of arms charged with Saint Gangulphus's image, a steed for the Rossberg (whose name literally means ‚ÄúSteed Mountain‚Äù) that lies between Becherbach and Gangloff and a holy spring (one of Gangulphus's attributes), thus symbolizing the club's home village.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Kirner Land, whose seat is in the town of Kirn. Becherbach bei Kirn should not be confused with Becherbach. Becherbach bei Kirn has borne the tag ‚Äúbei Kirn‚Äù since 1 July 1969, at which time both municipalities found themselves in the same district as a result of administrative reform. Geography =Location= Becherbach bei Kirn is situated on the Gro√übach in the North Palatine Uplands between the Nahe and the Glan. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Becherbach bei Kirn's neighbours are the municipality of Heimweiler, the municipality of Limbach, the municipality of Otzweiler (all in the Bad Kreuznach district) and the municipality of Schmidthachenbach (in the Birkenfeld district). History =Antiquity= Unearthed within Becherbach's limits have been archaeological finds bearing witness to a settlement here during Roman times.Antiquity =Middle Ages= Lying as it did on a trade road that linked the Kirn area with the Glan valley, Becherbach was in the Middle Ages the administrative and judicial seat for a whole series of villages in the surrounding area. Belonging to the court of Becherbach were the villages of Becherbach, Krebsweiler, Heimberg, Limbach, Otzweiler, Schmidthachenbach and Thal, a hamlet of four households in 1599 whose inhabitants enjoyed certain special privileges. This place has since vanished, and it is now uncertain as to where it lay. Named as possible sites for it have been a spot near Castle Naumburg and a location between Otzweiler and Becherbach. The Unteramtsbezirk of Becherbach was part of the Amt of Naumburg, which was made up of the courts of B√§renbach, Martin-Weierbach, Oberhachenbach, Oberreidenbach, L√∂llbach and, of course, Becherbach. This Amt of Naumburg was ceded by the Raugraves, a sideline of the Waldgraves, to the Counts of Sponheim-Kreuznach, first half of it in 1349, and then the whole towards the end of the 14th century. The Amt administrative seat was Castle Naumburg near B√§renbach, which had its first documentary mention, along with its owner, Raugrave Emich, in 1146.Middle Ages =Modern times= At the time when the County of Sponheim was partitioned in 1706, the Amt of Naumburg was assigned to the Badish part, then forming the Oberamt of Naumburg, and in 1776, the Amt seat was moved to Herrstein. Economically, the inhabitants of the Amt of Naumburg turned towards Kirn, where, as witnessed by a record from 1579, they had to pay an ‚Äúoat toll‚Äù (Zollhafer) just to get into the market. This was a kind of ‚Äúsales tax‚Äù levied by the Ganerben (holders of a joint-rule arrangement) of Steinkallenfels. The Becherbach court district was likewise a parish, whose mother church stood in Becherbach. Only in 1820 did Schmidthachenbach pass to the parish of Sien. The ecclesiastical structure was defined from 1345 to 1606 by the Lords of Oberstein, and later by the Lords of L√∂wenstein and the Lords of Schmidtburg. In 1785, Becherbach had 45 houses with 46 families. A few houses had upper floors.Modern times Recent times After the conquest by French Revolutionary troops, the villages of the former Amt of Naumburg passed to French hegemony beginning in 1794. Becherbach temporarily lost its function as an Amt seat and as of 1801 or 1802 belonged to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Schmidthachenbach. Also belonging to this were Otzweiler, Limbach, Heimberg, Krebsweiler and B√§renbach. After French rule ended, the area was subject as of 1814 at first to a joint Bavarian-Austrian transitional administration, but by the following year it had become Prussian before ending up in 1816 or 1817 in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. Becherbach now once again became a local seat of an Amt mayoralty as a so-called Oberschulthei√üerei in the Hesse-Homburg Oberamt of Meisenheim. After the House of Hesse-Homburg died out, the landgraviate passed in 1866 by inheritance first to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, but then only half a year later ultimately to Prussia. With the formation of the Prussian district of Meisenheim in 1869, the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Becherbach was enlarged with the addition of Hoppst√§dten and Hundsbach, which remained therein until 1940. In 1932, the Meisenheim district was dissolved and merged into the Bad Kreuznach district. The dissolution of the Amt of Becherbach and its assignment to the Amt of Kirn-Land came about in 1940. Since 1969 or 1970, the village, now an Ortsgemeinde, has been part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land.Recent times =Jewish history= In the 19th century, Becherbach was home to a small Jewish community. Its origins went back to the 18th century. Between 1782 and 1785, the municipal accounts name the families of David, Isaak and Salomon. Each of the Schutzjuden had to pay each year ten Rhenish guilders in Schutzgeld (literally ‚Äúprotection money‚Äù) to the lordly landholders. Living in the Mairie of Schmidthachenbach ‚Äì to which Becherbach belonged ‚Äì in 1808 were all together 57 Jews: in Becherbach 13 (three married couples, five boys, two girls), in Schmidthachenbach 12 (two married couples, three boys, four girls, one widow), in Weierbach 30 (five married couples, ten boys, nine girls, one widow) and in Otzweiler two (one married couple). In the course of the 19th century, the number of Jewish inhabitants developed as follows: 18 in 1867; 16 in 1887 (out of a total population of 489); 20 in 1895 (out of a total population of 490). In the Great Fire of Becherbach on 9 September 1854, 29 houses and 54 separate commercial buildings were destroyed, and others were damaged. The ‚Äúsynagogue‚Äù, too (see below), was burnt down. In the earlier half of the 19th century ‚Äì indeed until about 1870 ‚Äì the following ten Jewish families are known from civil registry documents and the municipal books to have lived in Becherbach: # Isaak Moritz (1749-1827, tradesman) and wife Sophie n√©e David with three children; # Peter Moritz (1788-1856) and wife Edeline Binnes (1786-?, after husband's death emigrated to United States) with six children; # Simon Moritz (1783-1862) with wife Nannette n√©e Gottschalk from Hennweiler (1797-1859) with eight children; # Michael Moritz (1795-1856) and wife Karoline n√©e Wendel from Rachtig (1794-1859) with four children; # Joseph Wolf from L√∂llbach (1803-1837) with wife Johannetta n√©e David (1793-?) with three children; # Emanuel Marx (1817-?) and first wife Henriette n√©e Salomon from Waldmohr (1819-1851) and second wife Christina n√©e Salomon (1829-?) with all together four children; # Ferdinand Moritz (1822-?) and wife Judith n√©e Haas (1818-?) with five children (all emigrated to United States in 1863); # David Wolf (1832-?, spice dealer) and wife Mina n√©e Loeb (1830-?) with six children (all moved to Kirn); # David Moritz (1821-1881) and wife Regina n√©e L√∂ser from Laufersweiler (1828-1897) with four children; # Ferdinand Moritz II (1830-?) and wife Wilhelmine n√©e L√∂ser from Laufersweiler (1835-?) with eight children. In the way of institutions, the Jews had a ‚Äúprayer parlour‚Äù (see below) and a graveyard. Since there was such a small Jewish population in Becherbach, it was hardly possible regularly to gather a minyan for services, and so the Jewish families in Becherbach joined the community in Hundsbach (see the relevant sections of that article for the community's history and information about its synagogue), and then no later than the 1920s, they joined the community in Kirn. In the First World War, one member of the Jewish community fell, Max Alfred Moritz (b. 16 May 1890 in Becherbach [or in Meisenheim, having lived until 1914 in Kirn] as salesman Isidor Moritz's and his wife Regina's [n√©e Wendel] son, d. 20 June 1916). His name is to be found on the plaque of honour for the fallen of both world wars at the Becherbach graveyard. About 1924, when there were only five Jews still living in the village, they belonged ‚Äì as mentioned above ‚Äì to the community in Kirn. They were four members of the family Moritz and an older man named Eisick (Isaak). After Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938), the village's last Jewish inhabitants left. On Kristallnacht itself, the family Moritz's shophouse was attacked and damaged. Mr. Moritz was taken to the Kirn prison, and thereafter was imprisoned at Dachau for three months. In 1939, the family Moritz fled by way of Luxembourg to France, where they survived the time of the Holocaust. Two others born in Becherbach, Ernst Moritz and Alfred Moritz, have since died (in August 2010 and January 2011 respectively). According to the Gedenkbuch ‚Äì Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 (‚ÄúMemorial Book ‚Äì Victims of the Persecution of the Jews under National Socialist Tyranny‚Äù) and Yad Vashem, of all Jews who either were born in Becherbach or lived there for a long time, three died in the time of the Third Reich (birthdates in brackets): # Claire L√∂b n√©e Moritz (1889); # Alfred Moritz (1886); # Frieda Moritz (1890).Jewish history =Municipality‚Äôs name= The name Becherbach may derive from the Middle High German bechaere and may be linked with the production of pitch (Pech in German) or charcoal.Municipality‚Äôs name Religion After the Reformation was introduced in 1557, Becherbach was until 1706 mainly Protestant, and thereafter a simultaneum held sway until 1892. The church has a Romanesque tower from the 12th century onto which in the years 1783-1788 a new nave was built, replacing one that had fallen into disrepair. In 1837, the three-floor tower was given two more floors and also its current pointed top. Beginning in 1757, there was a Catholic elementary school, even though only five Catholic families lived in the village then. Among the Protestants, those of the Reformed faith predominated, and each denomination had its own schoolteacher.Religion As at 31 July 2013, there are 388 full-time residents in Becherbach bei Kirn, and of those, 290 are Evangelical (74.742%), 51 are Catholic (13.144%), one is Lutheran (0.258%), 2 (0.515%) belong to other religious groups and 44 (11.34%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion =Synagogue= The Jewish families in Becherbach bei Kirn established not so much a synagogue as a Betstube (‚Äúpraying parlour‚Äù). In a great fire that struck the village on 9 September 1854, leaving 29 of the village's families homeless, the ‚Äúpraying parlour‚Äù ‚Äì it was often called the ‚Äúsynagogue‚Äù ‚Äì was burnt down, too. It is unknown in which house this small worship centre was. After the fire, it was never reestablished, and the village's Jewish inhabitants thereafter went to services in Hundsbach.Synagogue Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election results for Becherbach bei KirnMunicipal council =Mayor= Becherbach bei Kirn's mayor is Frank Sch√§tzel, and his deputies are Udo Barth and Friedrich Barth.Becherbach bei Kirn‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: √úber blau-gold geschachtem Schildfu√ü in Rot eine silberne Hauswand mit 6 durch Bogen verbundenen S√§ulen √ºber einem Sockel, der in der Breite von 3 Bogen von einer Treppe durchbrochen ist. Im mittleren Bogen befindet sich eine T√ºr, in den √ºbrigen befinden sich Fenster. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess abased gules a house wall with six columns conjoined by arches on a base interrupted for the breadth of the three middle arches by a stairway, in the middle arch a door, in each of the others a window, the whole argent, and chequy of 18 azure and Or. The charge in the upper field is a depiction of the entrance portal of a now vanished building, the Amtsgeb√§ude (‚ÄúAmt building‚Äù) in Becherbach, which was destroyed in 1944 in an air raid. The building, as seat of the Amt administration for the municipalities of Becherbach bei Kirn, B√§renbach, Heimberg, Hoppst√§dten, Hundsbach, Krebsweiler, Limbach and Otzweiler, was long the hub of this historically important municipality. From the time when the Amt was dissolved in 1940 until the building's destruction, it served Becherbach alone as the municipal hall. The ‚Äúchequy‚Äù pattern in the lower field is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim. On 11 June 1965, municipal council commissioned the graphic artist Brust, from Kirn-Sulzbach, to come up with a design for a municipal coat of arms. At its meeting on 18 September 1965, council adopted Brust's resulting design. After consent by the state archive, the Ministry of the Interior in Mainz granted approval for Becherbach to bear its own arms on 29 December 1965.Description and explanation of Becherbach bei Kirn‚Äôs arms The arms also appear on the municipal banner.Municipal banner Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Evangelical parish church, Kirchstra√üe ‚Äì Early Classicist aisleless church, 1783‚Äì1786, State Building Inspector Lindemann, west tower essentially Romanesque, made taller in 1837 * Catholic church, Neue Stra√üe ‚Äì Gothic Revival aisleless church, brickwork walls, 1893 * Hauptstra√üe 23 ‚Äì timber-frame house, essentially possibly from the 18th century * Im Winkel 1 ‚Äì former Evangelical rectory; Baroque timber-frame building, marked 1749 * Im Winkel 2 ‚Äì former school; partly timber-frame, marked 1755, essentially possibly from the 16th century * Oberdorfstra√üe 1 ‚Äì former smithy; timber-frame knee wall, latter half of the 19th century * Oberdorfstra√üe 5 ‚Äì former school; timber-frame building like house with single roof ridge, 1820 * Oberdorfstra√üe 14 ‚Äì house, Renaissance building, Flemish gable, marked 1597 * Across from Sachsenhausen 13 ‚Äì water cistern; built of red brick with sandstone finial, iron door marked ‚Äú1899/C.

The reason for this had not so much to do with cropraising and the clearing of ever further patches of wooded land as it did, above all else, with the settlers‚Äô wish to use the forest that was available to them with its typical Soonwald glades. No later than 1100, the Counts of Sponheim held sovereignty and several times transferred to their house monastery, called Sponheim Abbey, properties and incomes in Braunweiler. From the time of its founding, the village was at first only called Wilre (Weiler in Modern High German, meaning simply ‚Äúhamlet‚Äù). After the Sankt Katharinen monastery was founded in 1217, having been endowed by Godefried, Provost of Kreuznach, Udo, Archpriest at Mannendal (Mandel), Friedrich, State Dean of Hilbersheim and their fellow citizens (the members of the state chapter), Braunweiler was distinguished from other hamlets by having the tag by Sante Katherinen added to its name. In 1271, Braunweiler had its first documentary mention by Johannes Tritemus in Sponheim Abbey's chronicle. At that time, the abbey's abbot, Petrus von Sponheim, bought landholds for 200 Marks to build an estate with their help. Tritemus's writings, however, make it clear enough that this endeavour soon fell through and the lands that the abbot had bought were then yielded up to the villagers, against payment of certain fees. During the centuries that followed, there was an ownership history that is still rather murky, but it can be assumed that the villagers went through a whole series of feudal lords, lessees and landowners to whom they had to, among other things, pay part of their harvest. As late as the 15th century, Braunweiler still belonged to the free villages in the Kreuznach state court region. Thus, in times of need, the villagers could flee to the town (now called Bad Kreuznach), where they would be safer behind the town's fortifications. This privilege, however, came at a price, for Braunweiler was also expected to contribute to the town's defence and, for example, send a Sch√∂ffe (roughly ‚Äúlay jurist‚Äù) to the court. Braunweiler's municipal area was therefore part of the Kreuznach Imperial Estate in the Early Middle Ages. Politically, Braunweiler belonged from 1350 to 1798 to the Amt, and later Oberamt, of Kreuznach. But for a few censuses, there is no information about Braunweiler's population figures. In 1580, though, it is known that the village had 153 inhabitants, living in 34 houses. The building of the first chapel is believed to have come about sometime around the year 1475, but the chapel itself was only first mentioned in 1565. At this time, it was consecrated to Saint Quirinus, who was said to be the patron saint of livestock, particularly horses. In 1604, the town hall burnt down; it is unknown when it had been built. It also served several purposes after it was built anew in 1700, housing not only the mayor's dwelling and ‚Äúoffice‚Äù but also a sewing parlour, a bakery and a jail. The bakery was not a bakery as such so much as a communal bakehouse. There was no baker working there, only an oven to which anyone could bring his or her own dough to be baked into bread. It has been passed down in the local lore that the village once lay at the foot of the Gauchsberg at a spring (or perhaps a well). After the great fire in 1604, according to this lore, it was not only the town hall that burnt down, but rather the whole village. Then, when the village rose from the ashes, it did so not at its old site, but up in the heights, at its current site. This would, however, seem to be rather unlikely, for there is no clue left of this former state of affairs. On the other hand, similarities can be seen in Mandel and Sankt Katharinen, which both lie right at wells. In Braunweiler, though, the old well lies somewhat outside the village, and at best had to be reached by the Brunnenweg (‚Äúwell path‚Äù), which is still there today. A Weistum (cognate with English wisdom, this was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) has been handed down from 1654. It is a so-called Hof- und Gutsweistum, that is to say, one that dealt with estates and property. The Lords of Koppenstein owned, according to this, cropfields, meadows and vineyards within Braunweiler's limits totalling an area of 40 Morgen, which were let to villagers. Against this, the Junker of Koppenstein was entitled to 8 Malter of corn (likely meaning either wheat or rye), 5 Malter of oats and 12 albus. As early as 1665, history mentions the village's first schoolteacher, who came from the Amt of Stolberg in Saxony. Although at that time some of the schoolchildren were Catholic, Andreas Simon was presumably Protestant. Later, a Catholic school was established, and it was first mentioned in 1693. The schoolteacher there was also the church organist and sometimes even the church bookkeeper and court clerk. The pay kept rising over time and began with the schoolteacher's being allowed to use the disputed church meadow intensively, which in 1697 was converted into a cash payment of 5 Rhenish guilders. Soon, though, the landholders raised the salary from 5 to 20 guilders and 10 Malter of corn besides. In February 1689, the first Catholic church services in a long time were held, Braunweiler's mostly Protestant populace having gained a few Catholic families. In 1745, mainly through the Mannheim-based Electorate of the Palatinate government's efforts, a Catholic parish was once again established in Braunweiler. Agriculture was the villagers‚Äô economic mainstay until the mid 20th century. In the 19th century, there were few other jobs available, although there were some merchants, cobblers, carpenters and even locksmiths who could be named. =Municipality‚Äôs name= From the 15th century to the 18th, Braunweiler was also called Praumweiler or Pr√ºmweiler. The placename researcher H. Kaufmann derives this from the name Bruno, which is rather unlikely, as this name hearkens back to the Early Middle Ages, whereas Braunweiler arose only in the land-clearing phase of the High Middle Ages. It could also be that the name comes from Pr√ºm Abbey (not the better known one) in Roxheim, but that only existed up to the 9th century. Religion Braunweiler's first chapel, believed to have been built about 1475, was consecrated to Saint Quirinus. Braunweiler is traditionally of Catholic character. Saint Joseph‚Äôs Church (Kirche St. Josef) was until not too many years ago the parish church of the parish of Braunweiler-Sankt Katharinen. After a merger with the parish of St. Laurentius-Wallhausen, it is today part of the parish of Spabr√ºcken. Braunweiler belongs to the Evangelical parish of Mandel. As at 31 August 2013, there are 621 fulltime residents in Braunweiler, and of those, 116 are Evangelical (18.68%), 429 are Catholic (69.082%), 3 (0.483%) belong to other religious groups and 73 (11.755%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies hardly at all. At only 7% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded. History In 1387, Breitenheim belonged administratively to the seat of the Counts of Veldenz, Meisenheim, and passed in 1444 by inheritance to Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken, remaining with it until 1793, when French Revolutionary ‚Äì later Napoleonic French ‚Äì occupation began. After the Wars of Liberation, the Oberamt ‚Äì later district ‚Äì of Meisenheim passed on 1 September 1816, under the terms of the Congress of Vienna to the lordship of the Counts of Hesse- Homburg. After the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and incorporated as a district into the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz. The district of Meisenheim was dissolved on 1 October 1932, and Breitenheim has belonged to the district of Bad Kreuznach ever since.History =Archaeology= In June 1997, during excavation work for a new barn west of Breitenheim, there was an utterly unexpected discovery when some foundation remnants of an obviously very old building were unearthed. Thanks to builder Wolff's thoughtfulness and interest in history, knowledge of this find reached the state archaeologists in Mainz who were responsible for such things by way of Karen Gro√ü of the Meisenheim Historical Club. During a promptly undertaken survey of the village, the ruin was recognized as Roman and it was decided to undertake an immediate dig. This was, however, only possible with the family Wolff's and Mrs. Gro√ü's courtesy and support once again. Over a fortnight, a team from the Arch√§ologische Landesdenkmalpflege (State Archaeological Monument Care), Mainz office, sometimes thwarted by rain, dug the building's remnants up. Under local excavation engineer Klaus Soukop's leadership, six young men, most doing alternative civilian service but one a ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù, pealed back the layers of earth to bring the old foundations to light. A whole variety of equipment was deployed, everything from a compact excavator to a trowel. The goal was to make every trace of the building visible to learn as much as could be learnt about its size, possible conversions, the rooms‚Äô functions and the building technique. In the next step of the work, the whole site was photographed, drawn to scale and described ‚Äì requirements for scientific analysis. After one week came the careful burial work ‚Äì the site was not left exposed ‚Äì so that as planned, the barn could be built. In the coming years ‚Äì with the family Wolff's permission ‚Äì the further parts of the building are to be unearthed, which will make Breitenheim the only place within a great distance to have the footprint of a Roman villa rustica that has been so completely excavated. Hitherto, only a few carved stones with ornamental and figural decoration, set into the walls at Breitenheim's church, had made it clear that what is now Breitenheim was settled even as far back as Roman times. As parts of old tombs, these stones also indirectly bear witness to a villa rustica. In 1997, this was finally found, between the Jeckenbach and the Bollerb√ºbchen. A Roman villa rustica ‚Äì Latin for ‚Äúcountry estate‚Äù ‚Äì was made up of a main building, which was the dwelling, and several outbuildings, namely a barn, a stable, a shed, servants‚Äô quarters and so on. Such estates are known to have lain within very nearly every municipality in the district of Bad Kreuznach and neighbouring regions. Back in Roman times, villages, as the word is understood now, did not yet exist. Beginning in the 1st century AD, sometimes together with native Celtic timber-frame buildings, these country estates characterized the land for four centuries. Agricultural goods were produced here not only for the occupants‚Äô own needs, but also for the main towns in the region, towns now called Bad Kreuznach, Alzey, Bingen, Mainz, Worms and Trier, among others. Rising from stone foundations were plastered stone and timber-frame buildings with several floors, tiled roofs and glazed windows. Inside were frescoed floors, sometimes mosaics, a hypocaust, painted walls and wooden-beam or vaulted ceilings, sometimes stuccoed. Lockable wooden doors inside and leading outside afforded access to the rooms and joined them together. The fa√ßade was often impressively shaped with a colonnade over the entrance. A heated bathing facility was part of a villa rustica's basic appointments as surely as running water from the nearest spring. Removed somewhat from the main building but still within sight lay the private graveyard with gravestones or even optically pleasing grave monuments. The villa rustica was always linked to the well developed road network, and the next villa rustica along the road often lay only about a kilometre away. Discharged soldiers lived here, but mainly it was the newly wealthy native Celtic populace, who gladly adopted the Roman way of life and the things that Roman civilization had to offer. By the 4th century, though, or at the latest the 5th, this era of high living ended, and the Middle Ages announced their onset with the waves of migration that involved so much of Europe. The local area was then characterized more by Germanic peoples such as the Alemanni and the Franks.Archaeology Religion As at 31 August 2013, there are 404 full-time residents in Breitenheim, and of those, 314 are Evangelical (77.723%), 46 are Catholic (11.386%) and 44 (10.891%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Breitenheim's church stands in the village's south end.

Breitenheim's founding goes back to the time of the Frankish land expansion and it was originally named Breidenau. The village belonged to the County of Veldenz, and this is recalled by the charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side, the blue lion on a silver field.

Design and development In March 1929 Flight Lieutenant Nicholas Comper left the Royal Air Force and formed the Comper Aircraft Company to build an aircraft he had designed, the Comper Swift. He had previously designed and flown three aircraft for the Cranwell Light Aeroplane Club: the C.L.A.2, C.L.A.3 and C.L.A.4. The prototype Swift (registered G-AARX) first flew at Hooton Park in January 1930.Meaden (2003) The aircraft was a small single- seat, braced high-wing monoplane constructed of fabric-covered spruce wood frames.Riding (2003) The first Swift was powered by a 40 hp (30 kW) ABC Scorpion piston engine. After successful tests, seven more aircraft were built in 1930, powered by a 50 hp Salmson A.D.9 radial engine. Trials with Pobjoy P radial engine for use in air racing resulted in all the subsequent aircraft being powered by the Pobjoy R. The last three factory-built aircraft (sometimes called the Gipsy Swift) were fitted with de Havilland Gipsy engines ‚Äì two with 120 hp (89 kW) Gipsy Major III, and one with a 130 hp (97 kW) Gipsy Major.

The website displays the case information entered into the Consolidated Court Automation Programs (CCAP) case management system by court staff in the counties where the case files are located. The court record summaries provided by the system are all public records under Wisconsin open records law sections 19.31-19.39 of the Wisconsin Statutes. WCCA was created in response to an increasing number of requests for court records from district attorneys, sheriffs‚Äô departments, and other court business partners. Title companies, abstractors, members of the media and the general public have also benefited from WCCA. Since WCCA was implemented on January 1, 1992 in Vilas County, Wisconsin it has steadily expanded to all Wisconsin counties. The last county that joined the online system was Portage County in 2008. The website averages about a million data requests a day. It also has generated privacy concerns. Oversight Appointed by the director of state courts, the WCCA Oversight Committee serves as an advisory board on policy issues related to the WCCA Web site. The original WCCA Oversight Committee was convened in 2000. This committee was instrumental in the development of a comprehensive policy that addresses electronic access to circuit court records. The committee is being reconvened to review and possibly modify this policy based on feedback received in the intervening years about the information available on the WCCA Web site. In 2006, changes were made to the system that included a glossary of legal terms, a caution to employers regarding job discrimination, a decrease in the amount of time certain records remain public and an executive summary page.  Controversy  Personal information appearing in court records is protected by Wisconsin statutes only in limited circumstances. Wisconsin case law has said that even if the information may be harmful to an individual's reputation or privacy, that is not sufficient to allow a judge to seal a court record. Those who feel their safety is at risk may petition the court to remove their addresses from the online record of a non-criminal case. Wisconsin law allows a judge to \\"expunge\\" a case in only two situations, both involving youthful offenders: * Misdemeanors committed by person under age 25. If the judge ordered expunction upon successful completion of the sentence, the record can be expunged. See ¬ß973.015, Wis. Stats. * Adjudication of a juvenile delinquent. A juvenile who has been adjudged delinquent can, upon reaching age 17, petition the judge for expunction of the juvenile adjudication. See ¬ß938.355, Wis. Stats. (WCCA does not display juvenile adjudications because they are not public records.) An expunged case is sealed by the clerk of court and is available to be viewed only with a court order. If the judge properly orders a case expunged, any reference to it will be removed from WCCA. A judge has no other authority or power to expunge cases, and there are no similar provisions for other types of cases. Privacy advocate and Wisconsin State Assembly Representative Marlin Schneider, who is on the CCAP Oversight Committee, has said: > This easy access to information via computer constitutes a serious threat to > individuals' reputations, job applications, housing and even getting a date. > It has been used for identify theft, election mischief, and needs to be > controlled. In a state which prides itself on access to information it is > unlikely that anything will be done about this until a Supreme Court Justice > or Governor is the victim of this insidious system. Judge Gary Carlson of the Wisconsin Circuit Court, who served on the CCAP Creation Committee and continues to serve on the Oversight Committee, has said that people should be able to find out if someone served time. He said public records are public whether it's on the Internet or a hard-copy file. Judge Carlson said, > These are public records. These are the people's records. They're not mine. > They're not yours. The people have paid for these records. They own them. > They're their records. And they're entitled to see what is going on in their > court system. Free information advocates argue that WCCA does not contain any more personal information than the phone book - it does not include Social Security numbers - so it does not make identity theft any easier. Others argue that it does make identity theft easier because it contains information on gender, race, and birth date, which are not included in a phonebook.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Meisenheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. Desloch is a farming and winegrowing village. Geography =Location= Desloch is a linear village (by some definitions, a ‚Äúthorpe‚Äù) lying 3 km northwest of Meisenheim on the Glan at the north edge of the North Palatine Uplands. The municipal area measures 637 ha, of which 129 ha is wooded.Location Desloch lies on an old Roman road between the Nahe and the Glan.Location =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Desloch's neighbours are the municipality of Lauschied, the municipality of Abtweiler (at a single point only), the municipality of Raumbach, the town of Meisenheim, the municipality of Breitenheim and the municipality of Jeckenbach. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Desloch is the outlying homestead of Neuwieser Hof.Constituent communities History The village's name is of Celtic origin, meaning ‚Äúpool at the mountain‚Äù. As long ago as 400 BC, Celts were living on the heights around what is now Desloch. Over the centuries that followed, these Celts were supplanted by Germanic peoples who thrust their way from the Rhine‚Äôs right bank into the lands on the left bank only sporadically. From 50 BC to AD 450 ‚Äì fully 500 years ‚Äì the Romans held sway in the region, for a time even under Emperor Augustus. With the onset of the Migration Period and Rome‚Äôs downfall, the Romans vanished from the land. For a short time, Germanic tribes dwelt in the region before having to give way to the Franks, who founded new villages and farms, worked very hard, and were the lords at all the estates. It was in Frankish times, the time of the widespread woodland clearing, that the name Desloch ‚Äì earlier called Tageslach, and then Denslach ‚Äì arose. In 1184, Desloch had its first documentary mention. It had its beginnings in a monastic complex that was a branch of Disibodenberg Abbey. Desloch was in the Early Middle Ages the seat of a high court of the Waldgraves and the Counts Palatine. Even today, the local speech refers to the place before the church as Auf der Linde (‚ÄúAt the Limetree‚Äù). This was where the court sat. An old stone still recalls this today. In the Thirty Years' War, Desloch was laid waste together with its church, which stood on the same spot as today's church. The wooden chapel that had stood in the beginning was replaced with a sturdier church in 1570. This was the one that was destroyed, and a new one arose in its stead only in 1751. It still looms over the village today. In the 16th century, Desloch, which hitherto had belonged to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves at Kyrburg since 1128, was acquired through marriage by the Counts Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken, who then annexed it to Meisenheim. After the Thirty Years' War, the Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken organized some immigration for the now depopulated region, bringing people from the Tyrol, Switzerland, Italy, France and Holland to settle the land. Under King Louis XIV, the region was French from 1684 to 1697, and later became French a second time in French Revolutionary times and the Napoleonic Era that followed, from 1795 to 1815. In Frederick the Great‚Äôs time (18th century), many peasants emigrated to Pomerania and Lithuania. In 1823, many people emigrated to Brazil, whereas from 1837 to 1860 the destination was North America. From 1782 to 1785, there was a mass emigration to Galicia and Baƒçka in the Kingdom of Hungary (although most of Baƒçka now lies within Serbia). After the German campaign in the Napoleonic Wars, Desloch, together with the rest of the region south of the Nahe, passed as the Oberamt of Meisenheim to the Landgraves of Hesse-Homburg, to whom the village and region belonged for 50 years before passing in 1866 first to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and then, later that same year, to the Kingdom of Prussia. Thereafter, the village lived through the glory of the German Empire‚Äôs rise in 1870 and 1871 and the ignominy of defeat in both the First World War (1914-1918) and the Second World War (1939-1945). Both world wars exacted their toll on Desloch: in all, 55 men fell. Since the Second World War, the villagers have been working hard to beautify their village, winning several distinctions in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village should become lovelier‚Äù): first place at the district level in 1962; the same in both 1963 and 1964 but in the special class; first place at the regional level in 1964, and also the silver badge at the state level.HistoryHistory Religion As at 31 August 2013, there are 363 full- time residents in Desloch, and of those, 292 are Evangelical (80.441%), 28 are Catholic (7.713%), 1 (0.275%) belongs to another religious group and 42 (11.57%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election results for Desloch =Mayor= Desloch's mayor is Udo Reidenbach.Desloch‚Äôs mayorDesloch‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Gespalten von Schwarz und Gold √ºber einem Dreiberg in vertauschten Farben, darin vorne ein schwarzer, hinten ein goldener f√ºnffstrahliger Stern. Oben zwei einander zugewandte L√∂wen, einen f√ºnfstrahligen Stern in der mitte in vertauschten Farben haltend. Vorne der L√∂we gold, rotbewehrt und gekr√∂nt, hinten der L√∂we rot, blaubewehrt und gekr√∂nt. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale sable and Or a trimount counterchanged charged with two mullets of five in fess, each of the field, and upon which lions combatant, the dexter of the second armed, langued and crowned gules, the sinister of the third armed, langued and crowned azure, between their paws a mullet of five counterchanged. Known to history are two former local lordships: the Waldgraves and Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. Both bore the lion as an heraldic device, the Waldgraves a red one on a gold field, seen in Desloch's arms as the charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side, and the Counts Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken a gold one on a black field, seen here as the charge on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side, although in Desloch's arms, he has been turned round to become ‚Äúsinister‚Äù (facing heraldic left) so that the two lion charges in the arms are ‚Äúcombatant‚Äù. There was a happy circumstance with these arms insofar as, unlike many other coats of arms, this one actually obeys the rule of tincture. To distinguish Desloch's arms from Alsenz‚Äôs, which are similar, the village‚Äôs location was also considered. Desloch lies in a high dale, and at night can only be seen by stars. Thus, the two lions in the arms hold a star (‚Äúmullet of five‚Äù in blazon), while two others appear on the trimount to fill in what would otherwise be empty space. The tinctures used in Desloch's arms are drawn from those formerly borne by the Waldgraves and the Counts Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken. The arms have been borne since 2003.Description and explanation of Desloch‚Äôs arms File:Wappen Deslochn.pngDesloch's arms File:Wildgraf Dhaun COA.pngWaldgravial arms File:Palatinate Arms.svgPalatinate-Zweibr√ºcken's arms File:DEU Alsenz COA.svgAlsenz's ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Evangelical church, Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì Baroque aisleless church, marked 1751, tower made taller in 1857 (see also below) * Hauptstra√üe 43 ‚Äì former school, Late Classicist plastered building, mid 19th century * Neuwieser Stra√üe 6 ‚Äì Baroque timber-frame house, plastered, 18th century * Schulstra√üe 9 ‚Äì Late Classicist house with single roof ridge, quarrystone, marked 1869 More about the church The Desloch church, aligned towards the north, lies somewhat hidden on the main road going towards Jeckenbach. Shortly before reaching the former schoolhouse, one reaches, by way of a small stairway and then under two old limetrees, the way into the churchyard. In earlier times, the churchyard was Desloch's graveyard, but after 1833, when a new graveyard was laid out on the village's northeastern outskirts, it was used by the neighbouring school as an exercise yard and schoolyard. Anyone entering the church itself through the entrance on the east side is surprised and impressed by the unexpected wealth of artistic creativity that has gone into the windows and visual art inside. Information about the former church that once stood on this same spot, renovated in 1663/1664 and torn down in 1747, comes from a plan dating from the year of its demolition. It was a right-angled, two-naved building aligned east-west with a three-sided quire at the east end of the north nave, and a tower abutting it at the east end of the south nave. The church that stands today is a simpler building aligned towards the north with a three-sided quire onto which a hefty tower, which was made taller in 1857, is joined, and whose lower level may well go back to a mediaeval defensive tower. After the interior renovation in 1959, the inside of the church changed markedly, in three phases. The former eastern gallery was removed, thus making considerably more room inside the church. The whole quire was newly created. The altar, the baptismal font, the 18th-century pulpit, the carved confessional, believed to have been similar to the one at the Evangelical church in Staudernheim, and the choir bench behind the altar but within the congregation's sight all fell victim to the renovation work. The appointments in the church, with a small pulpit on a sandstone pedestal, a plain altar table and a stand for a baptismal bowl with a brass lid, all made of wood, had a rather humble look to them. The same went for the plain positive organ made by the firm Oberlinger that in the 1960s replaced the imposing organ that had unfortunately become unusable. The Desloch church's plain and cold-looking interior d√©cor motivated Manfred Herzhoff, then the pastor, to contact his friend Vilmo Gibello in the late 1970s. Gibello was a painter from Italy, although he now lived in England. He was born on 23 November 1916 in Occhieppo Superiore in northern Italy's Piedmont region. It was said of him that he bore the love of God within himself. This love for God may well have been the cause of Vilmo Gibello's decision to give a church an artistic makeover as praise to God after having travelled through Siberia and seen the many destroyed churches there. The Reverend Manfred Herzhoff arranged for the room in the Desloch Evangelical church that Vilmo Gibello sought for his work, and also put the municipality in touch with his artist friend. After visiting the church, Gibello produced the pictures in England. The municipal bus was then used to bring these pictures to Desloch, where they were framed and placed. The sequence of the pictures alone defined optical aspects. The three glass windows, which each have an especially impressive effect on the observer according to how the sun shines through them, were made in Desloch at the nearby schoolhouse, which was made available to Vilmo Gibello for the duration of his stay as both a lodging and a studio. On 17 May 1981, the ‚Äúoil paintings created on wooden tables and the stained glass designed on new indoor windows ‚Äì united into a cycle of Biblical motifs from Creation to Revelation, the end of the world‚Äù were presented to the congregation during a church service. As for the artist himself, he is spending his twilight years at his house near M√°laga in southern Spain‚Äôs Andalusia, and despite his great age, he still creates, making the proceeds of any sale of his artworks available to charitable bodies. The church is nowadays used on Sundays, alternating between regular church services and children‚Äôs church services, by the Jeckenbach Evangelical community, which was formed on 1 July 1972 out of the formerly separate communities of Desloch and Jeckenbach. Under the church‚Äôs roof, the grey long- eared bat (Plecotus austriacus), a species of bat indigenous to the Nahe region but threatened with extinction (at least locally; it is otherwise a Least Concern species), has made its summer home ‚Äì and its nursery roost ‚Äì for years.Evangelical church =Wells= Anybody who is willing to walk in the Romans‚Äô footsteps over the Desloch Heights towards Jeckenbach will find the R√∂merbrunnen, or ‚ÄúRoman Well‚Äù. Lying just inside neighbouring Jeckenbach's limits, this is an ancient scoop well complex that served Roman troops as a resting place, as this spot lay right on a Roman road that led across the heights.R√∂merbrunnen In the middle of the village itself is found the well at the fire pond. The well was built in the course of laying the sewerage at the square where the former fire pond once lay, sometime in the 20th century. The former fire pond, as the name suggests (it is called the Brandweiher in German, with the same literal meaning), was used on the one hand by the Desloch fire brigade as a reservoir in case of fire. On the other hand, it was from days of yore also a central gathering place for the villagers. There is a group in the village that stages the Brunnenfest (‚Äúwell festival‚Äù) each year.Well at the fire pond =Sport and leisure= For children, Desloch has a playground with a variety of playground equipment.Playground Anybody wishing to take a hike around Desloch can contact the municipality to arrange a guided hike.Guided hike Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Running to Desloch's east is Bundesstra√üe 420.

With a population of some 2,900 inhabitants, Guldental is the biggest rural winegrowing community on the Nahe. Geography Guldental =Location= Guldental lies in the Naheland ‚Äì the land lining each side of the Nahe ‚Äì among the southern foothills of the Hunsr√ºck, on the Guldenbach. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Guldental's neighbours are the municipality of Langenlonsheim, the municipality of Bretzenheim, the town of Bad Kreuznach, the municipality of Hargesheim, the municipality of Gutenberg and the municipality of Windesheim. =Constituent communities= Guldental's Ortsteile are Heddesheim and Waldhilbersheim. Also belonging to Guldental are the outlying homesteads of Breitenfelserhof and Ackerm√ºhle.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 15 (PDF; 2,3 MB) History Constituent community of Heddesheim above Constituent community of Waldhilbersheim below Breitenfelserhof As early as 1163, the landhold of Hetdenesheim (Heddesheim) had its first documentary mention and already by 700 years ago it was one of the greater villages in what is now the Bad Kreuznach district. Under Revolutionary/Napoleonic French rule, Heddesheim was grouped into the Mairie (\\"Mayoralty\\") of Langenlonsheim in 1800. The village, now constituent community of Guldental, Waldhilbersheim is likewise very old. Beginning as long ago as 1200, it began to crop up in documents. In 1800, however, it was grouped into the Mairie of Windesheim, and in 1939 into the Amt of Langenlonsheim. Today's Ortsgemeinde of Guldental was formed in the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate on 7 June 1969 through the merger of the hitherto self-administering municipalities of Heddesheim (Nahe) with its outlying centre of Breitenfelser Hof and Waldhilbersheim.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis 2006 , Seite 178 (PDF; 2,6 MB) Guldental thus became the biggest winegrowing community on the Nahe, with 417 ha of land given over to vineyards. The vineyards to the south run for 6 km along the Guldenbach. Winegrowing in this area is witnessed quite early on.History =Jewish history= Until the 1930s, there was a small Jewish community in Waldhilbersheim to which Jews in Heddesheim ‚Äì and thus in both villages that now make up Guldental ‚Äì also belonged. It had come to be established at least as far back as the 18th century. In 1808, Waldhilbersheim counted 29 Jewish inhabitants. Living here about 1858 were 50 Jews in Waldhilbersheim and another 40 in Heddesheim, but thereafter the numbers began to shrink with emigration and depopulation. This small community also included the Jewish inhabitants in Laubenheim until 1895, when they became tied to the community in Langenlonsheim. By 1925, the Jewish population in Waldhilbersheim and Heddesheim had sunk to 8 and 29 respectively. In the mid 1920s, the head of the Jewish community was August Schneider. In the way of institutions, the Jewish community had a small synagogue, a religious school (believed to have been housed somewhere in the synagogue) and a graveyard. To supply the community's religious needs, a \\"worship official\\" was hired, at least temporarily, to do the jobs of religious teacher, prayer leader and shochet. According to the GedenkbuchOpfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 (\\"Memorial BookVictims of the Persecution of the Jews under National Socialist Tyranny\\") and Yad Vashem, of all Jews who either were born in Waldhilbersheim or Heddesheim or lived there for a long time, 50 died under Nazi rule (birthdates in brackets): *From Waldhilbersheim: #Walter Aron (1894) #Moritz Gr√ºnewald (1886) #Hilde Hallgarten n√©e Simon (1895) #Erna Marcus n√©e Aron (1893) #Berta Schneider n√©e Abraham (1854) #Rosa Schneider (1882) #Thekla Wolf n√©e Schneider (1887, Rosa's sister) *From Heddesheim: #Frieda (Friedel) Ansbacher n√©e Stern (1896) #Max Ansbacher #Else Ansbacher #Willy Ansbacher #Leopold B√§hr (1873) #Walter Benjamin (1910) #Adelheid (Adele) Brunner n√©e Reinstein (1867) #Isidor Fl√∂rsheim (1870) #Ida Gr√ºnfeld n√©e Benjamin (1901) #Jakob Gr√ºnwald (1885) #Berthold Halm (1884) #Friederike (Frieda) Heilbron n√©e Stern (1870) #Erna Kahn n√©e Stern (1899) #Moritz Kahn (1885) #Ida Kiefer n√©e Wolf (1885) #Flora Meyer n√©e Stern (1893) #Sally Meyer #Betty Moses n√©e Stern (1901) #Willy Moses #Martha M√ºller n√©e Benjamin (1895) #Dorothe Schneider (1895) #Johanna Schneider (1892) #Sally Schwab #Helene Schwarz n√©e Benjamin (1884) #Bertha Stern n√©e Hirschfeld #Auguste Stern n√©e Lindauer #Emil Stern #David Stern (1878) #Heinrich Stern (1879) #Herbert Stern (1928) #Lina Stern n√©e Kahn #Lothar Stern (1930) #Markus Stern (1866) #Moses Stern (1863) #Sally Stern (1893) #Rosa Strau√ü n√©e Stern (1875) #Ella Wolf (1896) #Franz Wolf (1927) #Lotte Wolf (1921) #Moses Wolf (1855) #Selma Wolf n√©e Benjamin (1886) #Walter Josef Wolf (1922) #Amalie Zack n√©e Schneider (1891) On a memorial at the community's Jewish cemetery are the names of 23 persons who were murdered in the Holocaust. In the 19th century, the Jewish community held its services in rented rooms until in 1910 a favourably located house was acquired that cound be converted into a synagogue. On 16 September 1910, the synagogue was consecrated by the Kreuznach regional rabbi, Dr. Abraham Tawrogi. Also present were the mayors of both Windesheim and Langenlonsheim, along with Heddesheim's and Waldhilbersheim's municipal leaders, clergy and schoolteachers. The Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, a Jewish newspaper, reported the following on 7 October 1910: :Kreuznach, 28 September (1910). Last Thursday, the celebratory consecration of the newly built synagogue of the neighbouring municipalities of Heddesheim-Waldhilbersheim took place amidst participation of the citizenry of both villages. Also present were the Catholic and Evangelical pastors as well as all the schoolteachers of both church communities. Moreover, the Amt head and, from the surrounding area, the mayors of Windesheim and Langenlonsheim appeared. Mr. District Chairman von Nasse from Kreuznach, who was kept from attending the celebration by duty, had his wishes of luck to the Jewish community expressed by none other than Rabbi Dr. Tawrogi, who carried out the consecration of this House of God. After Mr. Cantor Marwit from Bingen had presented the liturgical songs with his tuneful voice, Rabbi Dr. Tawrogi lit the everlasting lamp. Thereupon, the magnificently adorned Torah scrolls found their way into the holy shrine to be kept there, whereupon Rabbi Dr. Tawrogi gave the festive speech. In this, the speaker remembered first all those who have contributed to the lovely synagogue's success through their work, thanked all who furthered the work through material support and spoke in an effective way about the purpose of the Jewish House of God. He exhorted the community to the right and assiduous use of this newly consecrated place. After the conclusion of this uplifting celebration, which ended with a prayer for the Kaiser and the Empire, the celebration participants accepted an invitation from the head of the Jewish community, Mr. August Schneider, to a comfortable get-together. The synagogue itself was a simple aisleless building with round and round-arch windows. Corner lesenes and an ascending frieze were the outward decorative elements. On Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938), the synagogue was wrecked and plundered. In the process, all the fittings and the ritual objects (two Torah scrolls, the silver menorah, silver beakers and plates, 75 prayer books, curtains and blankets), the pump organ, the stove, lamps and other useful things were stolen or destroyed by the Nazis. In January 1939, the building was sold and thereafter it was used as a storage building or a garage. On the street side, a gate was broken through, and the windows were walled up. Since 1994, the building has been under monumental protection. Its address in Waldhilbersheim is Naheweinstra√üe 83.Jewish history and synagogue Religion As at 30 September 2013, there are 2,460 full-time residents in Guldental, and of those, 768 are Evangelical (31.22%), 1,272 are Catholic (51.707%), 1 belongs to the Free Evangelical Church (0.041%), 1 is Greek Orthodox (0.041%), 4 are Lutheran (0.163%), 53 (2.154%) belong to other religious groups and 361 (14.675%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipal arms are put together from two coats of arms, the ones formerly borne by the two villages of Heddesheim and Waldhilbersheim before they were merged as part of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate. The charge in the upper field is Saint Andrew's Cross, a saltire (X-shaped cross) whose arms do not reach the field's outer edges (\\"humetty\\"). This was drawn from Waldhilbersheim's former arms. In the lower field stands a threefold charge, bird's wings. These were drawn from Heddesheim's former arms. The approval for the new, merged municipality of Guldental to bear these arms was granted some time after the actual 1969 merger, in 1971, by the now defunct Regierungsbezirk administration in Koblenz.Rainer Seil: GULDENTAL.

Michael von Obentraut, upon whom history has bestowed the honorific Deutscher Michel, is thus said to have brought Heddesheim legendary renown through his exploits in the Thirty Years' War. *Gustav Pfarrius (b. 31 December 1800; d. 15 August 1884 in Cologne), called the S√§nger des Nahetals (\\"Singer of the Nahe Valley\\"), came into the world in 1800 in Heddesheim.

This album has a much darker theme than the previous album of the band talking about death, the devil and hidden messages. This fact, however, didn't stop it for getting gold disc and latter platinum on remastering and the Carlos Gardel Award. The best example of the tone of the album is the fourth track \\"S√°bato\\", a tribute to Ernesto S√°bato and his books El T√∫nel and Sobre Heroes y Tumbas, while track 11 is a homage to Argentine tango musician and composer √Åstor Piazzolla. Track 7, \\"Hoy Llor√© Canci√≥n\\", features famous salsa songwriter Rub√©n Blades. Reception The Allmusic review by Victor W. Valdivia awarded the album 4 stars stating \\"Arguably the most focused, self-assured record of their career, Fabulosos Calavera shows the Cadillacs incorporating the hardest, heaviest guitar rock they've ever played into their usual m√©lange of ska, reggae, Caribbean, and Latin rhythms... the songwriting is superbly honed -- there seem to be no fat or extraneous parts in any of the album's 13 tracks. \\"Surfer Calavera\\" mixes thrash, funk, reggae, and harmony vocals into the album's most infectious track... Rather than being distracting, however, such stylistic shifts enhance the energy and highlight the emotional contrasts of the music... Fabulosos Calavera demonstrates that it is possible to have fun and give listeners plenty to chew on motionally. 12 years into their career, they made their most successful record yet. \\".Valdivia, V.

The ship was laid down at the Pembroke Dock in May 1894, she was launched in April 1896, and commissioned into the fleet in April 1898. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and a secondary battery of twelve guns. The ship had a top speed of . Hannibal served with the Channel Fleet (later reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet) after commissioning in 1898. In 1906 she underwent a refit, which included a conversion from a coal burner to using oil. She was placed in reserve from 1907, only to be mobilised in July 1914 as a precautionary measure prior to the outbreak of World War I. From August 1914 to February 1915 Hannibal was a guard ship at Scapa Flow. Later that year, her main armament was removed and she was converted to a troopship, serving in this capacity during the Dardanelles campaign. From November 1915 to the end of the war, she served as a depot ship based in Alexandria, Egypt. She was disposed of in 1920 and scrapped later that year.  Design  Right elevation, deck plan, and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902 Hannibal was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines powered by eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers. By 1907‚Äì08, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings. The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL 12-inch Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; six of her sisters had the same arrangement, but her sisters and and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes. Hannibal also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF 6-inch /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship's hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher. Hannibal and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed Hannibal and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armour, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship's armoured deck was thick.  Service history  Hannibal in 1898 The keel for HMS Hannibal was laid down at the Pembroke Dock on 1 May 1894. Her completed hull was launched on 28 April 1896. She went into the commissioned reserve upon completion in April 1898. On 10 May 1898 she went into full commission to serve in the Portsmouth division of the Channel Fleet, under the command of Captain Sir Baldwin Wake Walker. She was part of a huge fleet of ships present in the Solent for the passage of the body of Queen Victoria from Cowes to Portsmouth on 2 February 1901. Captain George Augustus Giffard was appointed in command on 10 May 1902, and she was present at the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902. Earlier the same month, two officers and a seaman of the Hannibal drowned while on a fishing excursion outside Berehaven. In September 1902 she was part of a squadron visiting Nauplia and Souda Bay at Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. On 17 October 1903 she collided with and badly damaged her sister ship off Ferrol, Spain. When a fleet reorganisation led to the Channel Fleet being redesignated the Atlantic Fleet on 1 January 1905, Hannibal became an Atlantic Fleet unit. Hannibal transferred to the new Channel Fleet (formerly the Home Fleet) on 28 February 1905. This service ended on 3 August 1905, when she paid off into reserve at Devonport. Hannibal underwent a refit in 1906 in which she was converted to burn oil fuel and received fire control for her main battery. She then recommissioned in reserve on 20 October 1906. In January 1907, Hannibal went into full commission as a temporary replacement for battleship in the Channel Fleet while Ocean was under refit. When Ocean returned to service, Hannibal remained in Channel Fleet service as a temporary replacement for battleship while Dominion was undergoing refit. When Dominion returned to service in May 1907, Hannibal went back into the commissioned reserve, becoming a part of the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet in July 1907. While in commissioned reserve at Portsmouth, Hannibal suffered two significant mishaps. On 19 August 1909 she struck a reef in Babbacombe Bay, damaging her bottom. On 29 October 1909 she collided with torpedo boat , suffering no damage herself but badly damaging the torpedo boat. She underwent a refit at Devonport from November 1911 to March 1912. =First World War= View of 'Y' turret (12 inch Mk VIII guns) and after superstructure from the quarter-deck. The Royal Navy began a precautionary mobilisation in July 1914 when war appeared increasingly likely. As part of this, Hannibal and her sister ships , , and formed the 9th Battle Squadron on 27 July 1914, stationed at the Humber to defend the British coast. Hannibal was serving as a guard ship on the Humber when the First World War began in August 1914. The 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved on 7 August 1914, and Hannibal was transferred to Scapa Flow, where she served as a guard ship until relieved by the first- class protected cruiser on 20 February 1915. Hannibal then paid off at Dalmuir. The ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy. While inactive at Dalmuir, Hannibal was disarmed between March and April 1915 except for four 6-inch (152-mm) guns and some lighter guns. Her 12-inch (305-mm) guns were taken for use aboard the new monitors and . After she was disarmed, she was laid up at Scapa Flow and Loch Goil until September 1915. Hannibal recommissioned at Greenock on 9 September 1915 to serve as a troopship in the Dardanelles campaign. She arrived at Mudros in this capacity on 7 October 1915. In November 1915, Hannibal became a depot ship for auxiliary patrol craft at Alexandria, Egypt, supporting both forces operating from Egypt and those in the Red Sea until June 1919, leaving Egypt for Malta on 9 September. Hannibal was paid off for disposal at Malta on 25 October 1919,Ship's log, available at http://www.naval-history.net/OWShips- WW1-01-HMS_Hannibal2.htm was sold for scrapping on the 28 January 1920, and was broken up in Italy.

He played college football for East Carolina University, and thereafter he played professionally for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL. Early years Long was born in Columbia, South Carolina, to Levane Pickney and Robert Luther Long. He attended Eau Claire High School of which he graduated from in 1977. One of his early jobs at the age of 14, he worked as a brick layer. After high school, Terry enlisted in the U.S. Army, and played football while stationed at Fort Bragg. Long was recruited from the military to play football for Columbia Junior College. While there, he studied for his degree in Business Administration. He'd later transfer to East Carolina, play football for that program, while still pursuing his degree. He was a four year starter for the Pirates, and earned his degree.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/triblive- pittsburgh-tribune-review/obituary.aspx?n=terrence-l-long&pid;=181931788 College career Long attended East Carolina University, where he played for the East Carolina Pirates football team from 1980 to 1983. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in 1983. While at college, Long was a four year starter.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/triblive-pittsburgh- tribune-review/obituary.aspx?n=terrence-l-long&pid;=181931788 Professional career The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Long in the fourth round (111th pick overall) of the 1984 NFL Draft, and he played for the Steelers from to . During his eight NFL seasons, he played in 105 games, and started 89 of them. Long recorded three fumble recoveries and even returned a kick off during a game in 1984. As a rookie in 1984, Long started seven games, as the Steelers finished 9-7, winning the AFC Central, despite an unstable quarterback situation, with former first round selection Mark Malone and former Dolphins starter David Woodley splitting the starting duties. The next season the Steelers dipped to 7-9, and the quarterback situation did improve, as both Malone and Woodley struggled, leading to second year pro Scott Campbell getting two starts at quarterback. That year Long played in 15 games and starter 14 of them. In 1986, Long started all 16 games, but the Steelers were not winners on the field, falling to a record of 6-10. Malone continued to struggled and so did rookie Bubby Brister. Despite the ineffective quarterback play, Long had one of his best seasons. Long did not cross the picket line in 1987 when the players went on strike. In 1989, he only started in nine games, though he'd start in all 16 the following season. In 1991, his final season, he only started three games and dressed for eight.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/L/LongTe20.htm Legal Troubles In the days leading up to his death, Long was facing a host of legal issues. Long had been indicted in March 2005 for arson and fraud charges from a fire that destroyed his chicken processing business. The fire occurred the same day he filed for chapter 11 protection in 2003. Though investigators quickly figured out the fire was set intentionally, it took further investigation to learn of the financial reasons behind the fire. In addition to the charges stemming from the fire, Long also faced charges regarding loans he'd received from the state that were supposed to be used to buy processing equipment for his company. On top of the charges he was facing, his home was also in foreclosure proceedings.https://archive.triblive.com/news/ex-steelers-lineman-indicted- for-arson-fraud-perjury/ Long had already had troubles with the law after the incident that occurred after Steelers coach Chuck Noll informed Long that he was being suspended by the NFL for failing a test for steroids; during the conversation, Long brandished a gun.https://www.post- gazette.com/sports/steelers/2005/06/10/Final-days-troubled-for-former-Steeler- Terry-Long/stories/200506100147 Death Long committed suicide in June 2005 by drinking a gallon of antifreeze. An autopsy revealed that Long suffered from CTE caused by his football career. His brain was studied by neuropathologist Bennet Omalu. He had previously attempted suicide in 1991, after testing positive for the NFL's steroid test. Long was buried at the Swansea Methodist Church Cemetery in Swansea, South Carolina. One week before he died, Long approached the minister of his church, and asked if he could speak to the church goers about his legal issues that were about to make headlines.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Kirner Land, whose seat is in the town of Kirn. Horbach is a state-recognized tourism community, and also the district's second smallest municipality by population, after Heinzenberg. Geography =Location= Horbach lies in the southern Hunsr√ºck at an elevation of 340 m above sea level on the western foothills of the Soonwald above the Kellenbach and the municipality of Simmertal. Found well away from the main through roads, Horbach lies across the Kellenbach valley from Schloss Dhaun, and unlike so many other municipalities in Kirn- Land, it has kept a certain agrarian character from bygone days in the village's appearance. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Horbach's neighbours are the municipalities of Simmertal and Brauweiler, both of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. History Horbach's name was attested in 1541 as Horbruch, which means ‚Äúboggy land‚Äù. Originally, Horbach, Brauweiler, Martinstein and Simmern unter Dhaun (since 1971 called Simmertal) formed a Markgenossenschaft, an association with combined economic and legal functions. All land, whether built upon or not, was a unit. Ecclesiastically and administratively, Simmern unter Dhaun was the hub of this great municipal area, while the neighbouring villages were either outgrowth or daughter settlements of this mother village. It can also be assumed that the neighbouring villages‚Äô foundings came about with the arrival of settlers from a village in the original municipal area, as otherwise there would be no way to explain everybody's rights to common land and joint ownership of grazing land, water and woodland. Only in 1513 was Horbach's municipal area split off from this greater body with the setting of 18 boundary stones. The lordship over the village of Horbach in the Middle Ages was shared among several lords, among whom were the Counts of Sponheim and the Waldgraves. In 1340, it is known that Horbach was granted Electoral Mainz rights, which later, in 1393, were bestowed upon the Knights of L√∂wenstein. In the time that followed, Horbach became part of the Imperial Knightly Lordship of Martinstein and counted the Barons of Ebersberg, called of Weyers-Leyen, among others, as its local lords. In 1747, the Evangelical church was built, at which the pastor from Simmern unter Dhaun provided church services. In the 18th century, the village lordship passed to the Margrave of Baden, who had the Lordship of Martinstein administered by an Amtmann who was resident at Castle Naumburg (near B√§renbach). Horbach and Martinstein each had a Schulthei√ü. In the course of administrative restructuring undertaken by the Revolutionary/Napoleonic French, Horbach was grouped about 1800 into the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Monzingen. The village remained in the later B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) or Amt of Monzingen until it was assigned to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land in 1970.Statistische Mappen, Verbandsgemeinde Kirn-Land, 2009History Religion As at 30 September 2013, there are 43 full-time residents in Horbach, and of those, 34 are Evangelical (79.07%), 4 are Catholic (9.302%) and 5 (11.628%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Horbach's mayor is G√ºnter Buhrmann-Klein, and his deputies are Erhard Christmann and Klaus Schmidt.Horbach‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Schild gespalten durch eine eingeschweifte, erniedrigte, blaue Spitze, darin ein silberner Pfahl. Vorn ein blaubewehrter und -gezungter roter L√∂we in Gold, hinten f√ºnf silberne (2:1:2) Kugeln in Schwarz. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pall reversed embowed to base in the flanks, dexter Or a lion rampant sinister gules armed and langued azure, sinister sable five roundles argent, two, one and two, and in base azure a pale of the fifth. The charge on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side, the lion, is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate. The quincunx charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is drawn from the arms once borne by the Lords of Sickingen. The composition appearing in base is drawn from the arms once borne by the House of Leyen. The coat of arms was modelled after an old border stone that can still be found in Horbach's outlying countryside today. Municipal council, on 6 April 1976, gave the graphic artist Brust from Kirn-Sulzbach the task of designing a municipal coat of arms. At a council meeting on 13 August 1978, council adopted the design that had been put forth.

Its walls are almost entirely covered by a famous cycle of frescoes by the Renaissance master Benozzo Gozzoli, painted around 1459 for the Medici family, the effective rulers of Florence.  Overview  The chapel is on the piano nobile of the palace and was one of the first rooms to be decorated after the completion of the building, designed by Michelozzo. In its original appearance the chapel was perfectly symmetrical and had its entrance through the central door, which today is closed. Inside, the chapel is divided into two juxtaposed squares: a large hall and a raised rectangular apse with an altar and two small lateral sacristies. Begun around 1449-50, the chapel was probably completed around 1459 with the precious ceiling of inlaid wood, painted and generously gilded by Pagno di Lapo Portigiano, according to Michelozzo's design. The latter also designed the flooring of marble mosaic work divided by elaborate geometric design, which due to the extraordinary value of the materials (porphyries, granites, etc.) affirmed the Medicis' desire to emulate the magnificence of the Roman basilicas and the Florentine Baptistry. leftthumb Fiorentino's Adoration (after Lippi). The first pictorial element in the chapel was the altar panel bearing Filippo Lippi's Adoration in the Forest. This painting is now in Berlin after being sold in the 19th century, while a copy by a follower of Lippi remains in the chapel. Apse, Detail of the choir of angels.The chapel is famous for the series of wall paintings by Benozzo Gozzoli, with the Angels in Adoration in the rectangular apse and the Journey of the Magi in the large hall. The latter is covered in three large frescos, each showing the procession of one of the Three Magi on their way to Bethlehem to see the Nativity of Jesus. The religious theme was combined with a depiction of several members of the Medici family, their allies and some of the important figures who arrived in Florence for the Council of Florence (1438-1439) several decades earlier. On that occasion the Medici could boast to have facilitated the (abortive, as it turned out) reconciliation between the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches. The luxury of the Byzantine dignitaries is manifest, and shows the impression they would have at the time on the Florentine population. In the apse, the side walls are painted with saints and angels in adoration, where Gozzoli followed the style of his master, Fra Angelico. There are also three thin vertical fresco sections showing the shepherds of the nativity. Gozzoli's Journey of the Magi East Wall. = Background = Having begun the work in the spring-summer of 1459, Benozzo probably completed the work rapidly over the space of a few months, with the help of at least one assistant, under the supervision of Piero di Cosimo de' Medici. It was probably Piero who suggested that the artist should use Gentile da Fabriano's Adoration of the Magi as a model for the frescoes. The extraordinary complexity and subtlety of the technique of execution, in which true fresco alternated with dry fresco, permitted the painter to work with meticulous care, almost as if he was engraving, like the goldsmith he had been in Ghiberti's workshop. This sheer craftsmanship is evident not just in the precious materials of jewelry, fabrics, and harnesses, but even in the trees laden with fruit, the meadows spangled with flowers, the variegated plumage of the birds, and the multicolored wings of the angels. Finally, leaves of pure gold were applied generously to shine in the dark, in the dim light of the candles. The painting is dedicated to a sacred subject but rich in traces of pomp and secular elegance. Hosts of angels sing and adore while the magnificent procession of the Three Kings approaches Bethlehem, accompanied by their respective entourages as they enjoy the scene of a noble hunting party with falcons and felines along the way. The sumptuous and varied costumes with their princely finishing make this pictorial series one of the most fascinating testimonies of art and costume of all time. = The procession = West Wall, Castruccio Castracani with a leopard, the symbol of his house. Melchior, the oldest Magus, rides on the west wall leading the procession. Traditionally, his features have been read as those of Joseph, Patriarch of Constantinople, who died in Florence during the Council; but they could also be those of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, who helped end the Great Schism by convoking the Council of Constance in 1414. Like Cosimo, he is shown as a peacemaker riding on a donkey. He is preceded by a page in blue with a leopard on his horse - this figure is a scherzo, a joke embedded in a painting, representing Castruccio Castracani, Duca di Lucca, according to C.F. Young‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Medici‚Äù, with the leopard being the sign of the house of Lucca. Giuliano de' Medici is shown riding a white horse, preceded by an African with a bow. Bearded Balthasar, the middle Magus, rides a white horse on the south wall. He is portrayed with the same facial features as Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaiologos. It is thought by some that the three pages behind him represent Piero's daughters, Nannina, Bianca and Maria, while others argue that the faces of those young women are more likely to be amongst the rest of the Medici portraits. Lorenzo.256x256px On the east wall, Caspar, the youngest Magus, leads the end of the procession on a white horse. This figure has often been taken for an idealized Lorenzo il Magnifico, who was born in 1449 and so was still a boy when the fresco was completed. Closely following Caspar are the contemporary head of the family, Piero the Gouty on a white horse, and devout family founder Cosimo on a humble donkey. Then come Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta and Galeazzo Maria Sforza, respectively lord of Rimini and Milan. They did not take part in the Council, but were guests of the Medici in Florence in the time the frescoes were painted. After them is a procession of illustrious Florentines, such as the humanists Marsilio Ficino and the Pulci brothers, the members of the Art Guilds and Benozzo himself. The painter looks out at the viewer and can be recognized for the scroll on his red hat, reading Opus Benotii. Little Lorenzo il Magnifico is the boy directly below him with the distinctive snub nose; Lorenzo's younger brother Giuliano is next to him.West Wall (cut clearly visible). With rich Tuscan landscapes filling the rest of the pictorial space, this fresco was designed like contemporary tapestries, a new type of courtly art destined for wealthy patrons. The fortress, in the style of medieval castles, which appears at the highest point of the picture and is the point from which the king's pilgrimage has set out, is similar to the Medicis' country seat in Cafaggiolo, which was again designed by Michelozzo. It is interpreted as Jerusalem, where the procession of the magi started. This was where King Herod had instructed the wise men to search for the child. Gozzoli's patron, Piero de' Medici, felt some of the seraphim were unsuitable, and wanted them painted over. Although the artist agreed to do this, it was never actually done. In 1659, the Riccardi family bought the Palazzo Medici and undertook some structural changes. This included, in 1689, the building of an exterior flight of stairs leading up to the first floor. For this purpose the entrance to the chapel had to be moved. During the process, two sections of wall were cut out of the south western corner, in the Procession of the Oldest King. After the stairs were finished, the cut out elements were mounted on a corner of the wall projecting into the room. During the course of this, the oldest king's horse was cut up and mounted on two different segments of the wall.

Its typical historical appearance as a rural village has been preserved. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Hundsbach's neighbours are the municipalities of Kirschroth, B√§rweiler, Lauschied, Jeckenbach, Schweinschied and Limbach, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Hundsbach are the outlying homesteads of Forsthaus Hundsbach and Lochm√ºhle.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 15 (PDF; 2,2 MB) =Climate= Yearly precipitation in Hundsbach amounts to 590 mm, which is very low, falling into the lowest fourth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 19% of the German Weather Service's weather stations are even lower figures recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in May. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies only slightly and is spread quite evenly over the year. At only 1% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded. History Hundsbach is found on an old Roman road that led from the Rhine Valley to Metz. The village, mentioned in old records as Hundisbach had for a while in the Middle Ages two centres, Oberhundsbach and Niederhundsbach (‚ÄúUpper‚Äù and ‚ÄúNether‚Äù). By 1611, however, Hundsbach had been given up, and this even before the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). Hundsbach belonged to the County of Veldenz, and as of 1386 to the Waldgraves. From 1816 to 1866 it belonged to the Oberamt of Meisenheim in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg, passing with this state in 1866 to the Kingdom of Prussia. Late in the Second World War, Hundsbach was almost utterly destroyed. =Jewish history= Hundsbach had a Jewish community in the 19th century. It arose in the 18th century. In the 19th century, the number of Jewish inhabitants developed as follows: in 1808, 40 Jewish inhabitants; in 1867, 22 (of all together 688 inhabitants); in 1895, 21. About 1870, known Jewish family heads were Moses Haas, Ludwig Winer, Abraham Leiser and Jakob Adler, who were all merchants whose existence is confirmed in this year by their registration at the Sobernheim Amt court as the Jewish graveyard's owners. All together, documents are still available from the registry office and the municipal books witnessing 18 Jewish families in Hundsbach in the earlier half of the 19th century (until about 1870): # David Heymann (1772-1855) with wife Eva n√©e Wolf (1775-1838) and eight children # Samuel Heymann (1731-18??), widower # David Leiser (1774-1842) with wife Veronika n√©e Max (1776-1839) and two children # Abraham Leiser (1765-1841) with wife Judith (1773-1850) and six children # Jacob Marx (1795-1848) with wife Klara n√©e Seligmann (1789-?) and three children # Veronika n√©e Daniel (1749-1827), widow of David Seligmann and two children # Isaak Haas (1778-18??) and first wife Esther as well as second wife Sara and together from both marriages five children # Gumpel Frenckel (late) and four children # Nathan Schiff (1788-1831) with wife Sara n√©e Leiser (1801-1874) and three children; Sara Leiser married Moises Wiener in a second marriage # Joseph Leyser (1798-1864) with wife Philippina Schwarzschild from Gaugrehweiler (1808-1868) and eight children # Wolfgang Heymann (1803-1859) and first wife Johannetta n√©e Feist (1808-1836), second wife Henriette n√©e Wolf (1806-1858) and third wife Fanny n√©e Strau√ü (1821-1883) and together from all marriages eleven children # Moises Wiener (1799-1841) with wife Sara n√©e Leiser (1801-1874) # Marcus Leiser (1804-?, shochet) with wife Eva n√©e B√∂hm and two children # Aaron Haas (1811-1875, locksmith) and first wife Rosetta n√©e Haas (1812-1849), second wife Sara n√©e Stern (1812-185?) and together from both marriages four children # Marx Leyser (1815-?, emigrated to the United States) with wife Theresia n√©e Herz (1819-?) and one son # Ludwig Leyser (1840-?) with wife Theresia n√©e Lahn (1842-?) and five children # Ludwig Wiener (1836-?) with wife Karolina n√©e Levi (1841-?) and five children # Moses Haas (1844-?) with wife Johanetta n√©e Rothschild from Ulmet (1869-?) and three children In the way of institutions, there were a synagogue (see Former synagogue below), a Jewish school, a mikveh and a graveyard. To provide for the community's religious needs, a schoolteacher was hired for a time, who also busied himself as the hazzan (and the shochet?). The community belonged to the Rabbinate of Meisenheim. The Jews living in Becherbach bei Kirn, B√§rweiler, Schweinschied, L√∂llbach and Hoppst√§dten formed outlying parts of this Jewish community. In 1807, the following Jewish families were living in these villages (firm family names had not yet been adopted): in B√§rweiler Loeb Jacob, Lasar Levy, Moyses Jacob and Seuve Gurnberg; in Schweinschied Joseph Nathan, Jacob Salomon, Susel Salomon, Isaac Abraham and Jacob Aaron; in L√∂llbach Herz Nathan, Jacob Wolff and Daniel Cahen. In 1867, there were 18 Jewish inhabitants in Becherbach bei Kirn, 13 in B√§rweiler, 8 in Schweinschied, 6 in L√∂llbach and 4 in Hoppst√§dten. L√∂llbach also had its own Jewish graveyard. About 1924, four more families belonged to the Jewish community in Hundsbach (family names Blum, Adler and Leiser). Still living then in Hundsbach were ten Jewish inhabitants. Some of them left the village in the years after 1933, the year when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power in Germany, though, some of the Jews moved away or emigrated in the face of the boycotting of their businesses, the progressive stripping of their rights and repression, all brought about by the Nazis. According to Yad Vashem‚Äôs lists and information from the work Gedenkbuch - Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 (‚ÄúMemorial Book ‚Äì Victims of the Persecution of Jews under the National Socialist Tyranny in Germany 1933-1945‚Äù), the following members of Hundsbach's Jewish community fell victim to the Holocaust (along with their birth years): * Bertha B√§r n√©e Frenkel (1880) * Rosa Frenkel (1883) * Erna Leiser (1900) There were also two others from Schweinschied, who had since moved to Frankfurt: * Lina Adler (1871) * Martha Becker n√©e Adler (1885)Jewish community‚Äôs history Religion As at 30 September 2013, there are 390 full- time residents in Hundsbach, and of those, 308 are Evangelical (78.974%), 53 are Catholic (13.59%), and 29 (7.436%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 8 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Hundsbach's mayor is Joachim Blum.Hundsbach‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: In rotem, durch goldenen Wellenbalken geteilten Schild, oben am goldenen Schaft eine dreil√§ntzige, silberne Sturmfahne, unten drei silberne schr√§grechtsgestellte G√ºrtelschnallen.

No later than 1866, though, there was a synagogue on Untergasse (a lane). This is known from a report from that year about a fire there, which damaged the building. In 1880, another fire broke out at the property next door causing such great damage that a new building had to be built. On 26 August 1881, the new synagogue building was consecrated. The village chronicle reported the celebration, in which ‚Äúthe district chairman, among others, took part‚Ä¶ [as did] the representatives of the municipality of Hundsbach and the district rabbi, who gave an uplifting speech in the house, which was filled by the crowd.‚Äù How long regular services were held at the synagogue is unknown. Possibly as early as the turn of the 20th century, and no later than the time of the First World War, Jews from Hundsbach were attending services in Sien. On 7 July 1930, the synagogue, with its yard and school (195 m¬≤), was sold to a farmer named Frenger, who used the building for storage. On Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938), Brownshirts from Meisenheim supposedly destroyed the synagogue, but there is oral history in Hundsbach that holds that the destruction was actually undertaken by private citizens from the village itself. It could be that the SA had been made aware that for eight years, the building had no longer been under Jewish ownership. After 1945, the building was used as the local Raiffeisen storehouse. In 1987, the building was placed under monumental protection. In the 1990s, the building was restored and was tended by those charged with the care of monuments. Since then, it has been used as a house.Jewish community‚Äôs synagogue =Jewish graveyard= The Jewish graveyard in Hundsbach was laid out in the late 17th or early 18th century and is among the district's oldest. The gravestones can be found towards the graveyard's lower end; many are heavily weathered. The graveyard has an area of 1 159 m¬≤. It is easily visible on a hill roughly one kilometre east of Hundsbach (‚ÄúAm Judenkirchhof‚Äù), some 400 m from the road that leads from Kirn to Meisenheim. Coming from Hundsbach, it can be made out on the heights to the right of the road and can be reached along a farm lane.Jewish graveyard Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Running through Hundsbach is Landesstra√üe 182, which links to Bundesstra√üe 420 at Meisenheim to the southeast. In the other direction, the road leads to Becherbach bei Kirn and then Kirn itself, where it links with Bundesstra√üe 41. Landesstra√üe 182 also has a junction with Landesstra√üe 374 just before Becherbach bei Kirn, which leads to Bundesstra√üe 270 at Sien. Serving Kirn is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken).

The school was named after William Turnbull, Bishop of Glasgow from 1448 to 1454, and founder of the University of Glasgow in 1451, of which he was the first Chancellor. Whilst enrollment is open to pupils of all religious denominations and none, the School's religious ethos emphasises practice of Roman Catholic moral values both in the church and in the community, with its own Chaplain and many associated charitable and community-based activities undertaken. Turnbull High School has been consistently ranked amongst the top 40 (10th percentile) of Scotland's 376 state secondary schools in recent years, with attainment levels for both Standard Grade and Scottish Qualifications Certificate examinations routinely above the national average.Kirkintilloch Herald - Turnbull High is given clean bill of health The school also has a reputation for sporting excellence, particularly in Association football, with several alumni playing at a professional level. The school's staff are appointed with the approval of the Archdiocese of Glasgow, in accordance with the Education (Scotland) Act 1918, which first established state support for Catholic schools. Turnbull is affiliated with the three Catholic Primary Schools in its Catchment area, St. Matthew's and St. Helen's in Bishopbriggs and pupils from Torrance who attend St. Machan's in Lennoxtown. Pupils from St. Andrew‚Äôs, Bearsden and St. Joseph‚Äôs, Milngavie, also have an entitlement to places in Turnbull High School. History The original school campus was constructed in 1974 by the Lanarkshire County Architect's Department using a CLASP system of modular building design developed by Robert Forsyth. Initially intended as a Satellite campus of what was then Bishopbriggs' only secondary school, the non- denominational Bishopbriggs High School, it was built on part of the former estate of Kenmure House, which was demolished in 1955. As a result of campaigning amongst the Catholic community in the town, who had previously had to utilise St Ninian's High School in Kirkintilloch or the private St. Aloysius' College in Garnethill, it was re-designated as a separate local Catholic school, one of two within the new Strathkelvin district that had been formed in 1975. Turnbull High School initially only offered academic courses up to O-grade in fourth year. In 1978, it achieved full six year status and began to offer a comprehensive curriculum up to Higher Grade. Its catchment area also expanded to include pupils from the village of Torrance. The school's Parent-Teacher Association was formed in June 1988. The first teacher to be put in charge of the new school, was Mr Stephen Joyce, who remained there until 1982. He was then seconded by the Archdiocese of Glasgow to write pupil texts for the new Religious Education syllabus for Scottish Secondary Schools. Following that he spent 6 years as Director of Values Education at St Andrew's College, Bearsden. The school motto, Respice Finem, was adopted from the Latin manuscript, Gesta Romanorum, Chapter 103: Quidquid agas, prudenter agas, et respice finem, which means: Whatever you do, do cautiously, and look to the end. The three bull's heads featured on the school shield are based on the Coat of Arms of Bishop Turnbull. Former school buildings Aerial overview of the campus buildings at Turnbull High School prior to the April 2007 demolition work and construction beginning on the new school building. The old main teaching block consisted of a three-storey building containing three Art and Design rooms, Social sciences, Religious Education, English and Modern languages classrooms, Science labs, ICT labs and Home Economics facilities. Administrative offices, the Oratory and Cafeteria were also housed in this building. An extension to the main building was opened in September 2002 and provided pupil recreational areas, offices, a staffroom, S6 Common room and a larger School library. Two Music studios, two music practice rooms and two indoor Gymnasia for PE were housed in an additional block along with the school Auditorium. Another block housed the Technical and Graphic design department, consisting of a technical drawing room, a graphic design studio, a woodwork room, a metalwork room and a craft and design workshop. Both external buildings were linked to the Main Building by covered walkways. A modular annexe building was opened in October 1998, providing seven additional classrooms for Mathematics and allowing adaptations to be made to rooms in the Main Building in order to enhance ICT and Science lab facilities. New building Main Building of Turnbull High School in 2007 In 2009 the original Turnbull High School buildings were replaced by a new building on the existing campus. This was undertaken as part of a ¬£134 million East Dunbartonshire Council Public-Private Partnership project to build six new secondary schools.Partnerships UK - Case Study : East Dunbartonshire Council Schools PPP Project The new school was designed by SMC Parr, with construction carried out by Morgan Sindall. The school will be operated on a 30-year Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) contract by a consortium including AMEC and John Laing. =Construction= From April 2007, the former Auditorium, Music and PE block was demolished and the Maths annexe relocated, in order to facilitate the start of construction on the new building. The school remained on site whilst the new building was constructed adjacent to the remaining buildings. The only original building that remains from the old school is the 2003 Games Hall, which has been expanded to house the entire PE department. In order to adjust for the reduced capacity of the new school building, the roll was capped at 120 pupils in each year group, which was reduced from a potential maximum of 838 in the old buildings. The new school building accommodates approximately 650 pupils in a single three-storey block. The main building consists of two wings of accommodation to the west and east, which are linked by a central atrium, housing an internal courtyard, the cafeteria, an auditorium and performance space. =Opening= The new building was completed for the start of the August 2009 term and was officially opened on 21 September 2009 by Councillor Una Walker, Education Convener of East Dunbartonshire Council. The new school building was subsequently blessed during a Mass held by the Archbishop of Glasgow, Mario Conti on 27 October 2009. The remaining original buildings were demolished during November 2009 and have been replaced by a landscaped area.

Griffin wrote and recorded \\"Top of the World\\" in 2000 for Silver Bell. But a dispute with her label A&M; Records caused Griffin to be dropped and the album to go unreleased for 13 years,. In the meantime, copies of Silver Bell circulated and increased Griffin's reputation as a songwriter within the music industry. The Dixie Chicks had already covered other Griffin songs and had toured with Griffin on their 2000 Fly Tour,. They recorded two Silver Bell songs, \\"Truth No. 2\\" and \\"Top of the World,\\" for their 2003 album Home, the latter as the concluding track. Beginning quietly with Home's mixture of acoustic stringed instruments, and with the vocal line shifting around among one-, two-, and three-part singing, \\"Top of the World\\" begins by portraying an almost unbearable level of regret p. 23. at things not done: Tension is built up with pauses, then midway through a string section begins accompanying in an ominous fashion. The reason for the regret is unveiled: The strings then pick up in intensity during the instrumental coda, as Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines moans wordlessly and then repeats \\"To the top of the world\\" as a mantra over and over. Dixie Chick Emily Robison said of \\"Top of the World\\" that it was \\"biggest departure on the album, but I'm so glad that we did it because I think it shows a whole other dimension.\\" During their 2002 concert film An Evening with the Dixie Chicks, Maines attempted to explain the song's startingly unusual perspective: > It is written from the point of view of a man who has passed on, and he's > sort of looking down wishing that he had been a different person, and having > a lot of regrets and wishing he hadn't had the negative effect on the people > in his life and err... I don't know what I just said... Author Chris Willman wrote that this was \\"a song that could send a chill down even a seasoned spine after repeat listens.\\" Entertainment Weekly stated that the Dixie Chicks' recording \\"lift[ed] the quality of [the song] in a way [its] author herself could not.\\" The New York Times said that \\"Top of the World\\" was an example of the Dixie Chicks turning to Griffin for their most ambitious material that at the same time led to the Chicks' commercial and critical success. \\"Top of the World\\" was released as a single in mid-2003, together with a music video, but failed to chart. At six minutes the song was likely too long for radio, but by now the infamous controversy regarding Maines' criticism of U.S. President George W. Bush had broken out, and the Chicks had become a country radio anathema. Maines would remark of the video, \\"We haven't been banned from television yet.\\" Directed by Sophie Muller and filmed in London, it portrayed the three Chicks as three women in different stages of the protagonist's life. The story started with a boy growing up with his single mother (Emily Robison), who frequently abused and neglected him. As a result, he would become frustrated with his life and in turn mutilate inanimate objects such as a rag doll. Later, the boy grows up as a bitter person and never grows close to his daughter and wife (Martie Maguire). When he became old, and his daughter (Natalie Maines) grows up, she loves and takes care of him like her mother did when she was little. The old man dies feeling regretful about his life, but the cycle is broken when Natalie raises a good family in her generation and loves her family. It was premiered on VH1 on September 22, 2003, and it would later be nominated for MVPA Awards in the Adult Contemporary Video and Director of the Year categories. Although not one of the Chicks' big hits, the song was prominent enough that the trio's 2003 Top of the World Tour was named after it, as were the subsequent Top of the World Tour: Live album and Top of the World Tour: Live DVD. Indeed, \\"Top of the World\\" was one of the emotional centerpieces of the shows on the tour, and the live recording of the song would go on to win the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The song remained one of the highlights of the group's 2006 Accidents & Accusations Tour, with violinist Martie Maguire moving from the front of the stage to join the band's violin and cello player for a dramatic, elongated string part during the coda. Griffin's own re-recording of \\"Top of the World\\" would finally surface for good on her 2004 album Impossible Dream As the Dixie Chicks' version had been close in arrangement to Griffin's original, Griffin re-arranged it this time around. It featured the violin of Lisa Germano, and Allmusic described the recording's \\"quietly intense relationship meditation\\" as reaching an \\"aching climax\\". The Washington Post wrote that Griffin's recording would have \\"flooded the country airwaves\\" were it not for \\"music business realities\\". and again in 2013 when Silver Bell was finally released by A&M; Records and Universal Music Enterprises. \\"Top of the World\\" has been performed by others as well, notably Jessica Harp of The Wreckers, Kelly Clarkson, and Australian singers Jasmine Rae and Kasey Chambers.

With the help of the newly arrived colony of the Society of the Sacred Heart, he worked to prepare the way for Pierre-Jean De Smet and the other Jesuit missionaries, who came to Florissant in 1823. He labored among both the Catholic families and the Osage Nation of the plains. When Father Van Quickenborne, S.J., arrived with his eight companions, de la Croix had nearly completed a brick church, started a farm, and opened a missionary field for the work of young Jesuits. Having been appointed to St. Michael's parish in lower Louisiana, Father de la Croix prepared a convent for the Society of the Sacred Heart, in which they opened a boarding school in 1828. The following year, he returned to Belgium and used funds he had collected there to build a church in the United States, which was completed in 1832. In 1833, he returned to Belgium once more, where he became a canon of the cathedral of Ghent, a position he held until his death 36 years later.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Kirner Land, whose seat is in the town of Kirn. Geography =Location= K√∂nigsau lies in a dale in the southern Hunsr√ºck at the edge of the Soonwald and L√ºtzelsoon. The Kellenbach flows through the village. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, K√∂nigsau‚Äôs neighbours are the municipalities of Henau, Kellenbach, Schlierschied and ‚Äì at one point only ‚Äì Gehlweiler. Of these, only Kellenbach likewise lies within the Bad Kreuznach district. All the others lie in the neighbouring Rhein-Hunsr√ºck-Kreis. History In 1325, K√∂nigsau had its first documentary mention as Kunigesauwe. Later spellings of the name, in modern times, render it K√∂nig√ü Auen (1601) or Kinzau (1766), the latter of which is preserved to this day in the name for the village used in the local speech, ‚ÄúKinze‚Äù. The mediaeval name goes back to the Old High German cuning (meaning the same as and cognate with the English word ‚Äúking‚Äù;Etymology of ‚Äúking‚Äù it is K√∂nig in Modern High German), which has led to the conclusion that the K√∂nigsau-Kellenbach area was once a royal or Imperial estate. Fitting this interpretation would be the Lords of Stein (Steinkallenfels), who exercised jurisdiction as Imperial ministeriales at the high court of Kellenbach. In 1325, Baldwin, Prince-Archbishop-Elector of Trier, acquired from the knight Sir Friedrich of Steinkallenfels shares of the holdings and rights that he held in K√∂nigsau and Schwarzerden and had split off from the landholds owned by Count Johann of Sponheim. In 1334, the Archbishop bought, among other things, a mill complex in K√∂nigsau, with which his successor Bohemond II of Trier enfeoffed Sir Tilmann of Stein ‚Äì of the same knightly house ‚Äì who was also the builder of Castle Wartenstein. In the time that followed, the Archbishops of Trier further enfeoffed various families of the lower nobility, such as the families von Elz, von R√ºdesheim and von der Leyen, and the V√∂gte of Hunolstein, with the Trier landholds and rights in K√∂nigsau. It is, however, unclear who held sway over K√∂nigsau in the 17th and 18th centuries. Although Trier state law prevailed in K√∂nigsau, sovereignty thereover was disputable, for, on the one hand, the Electorate of Trier claimed it for itself, whereas on the other hand, the Baron of Warsberg viewed the village as an allodial, Imperial, knightly landhold. K√∂nigsau was furthermore part of the court of Kellenbach, which was subject to the Sponheim Amt of Kirchberg. In 1708, this Amt was transferred to the Margrave of Baden in the wake of the division of the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim. The tangle of rights and allegiances to various lords during the time of the old empire was swept aside when, beginning in the years 1792-1794, the Revolutionary French overran the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank and occupied them, eventually placing the region under a central administration in 1798. K√∂nigsau and Kellenbach belonged as of roughly 1800 to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Kirn in the Arrondissement of Simmern, in which it remained (albeit under other terminology than ‚ÄúArrondissement‚Äù) until 1969. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, K√∂nigsau and Kellenbach were grouped into the new Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land on 8 November 1970.History Religion As at 30 September 2013, there are 69 full-time residents in K√∂nigsau, and of those, 43 are Evangelical (62.319%), 16 are Catholic (23.188%), 1 is Greek Orthodox (1.449%), 1 belongs to the Palatinate State Free Religious Community (1.449%) and 8 (11.594%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= K√∂nigsau‚Äôs mayor is Heinrich Riegel, and his deputy is Hermann Br√ºninghoff.K√∂nigsau‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess sable a demilion with forked tail argent armed, langued and crowned Or, and argent a trimount enhanced vert surmounted by a crown of the third. The charge in the upper field, the upper half of a lion, is drawn from arms formerly borne by the Barons of Warsberg, who through inheritance became the landholders in K√∂nigsau in 1585. The trimount in the lower field symbolizes the hilly landscape in the municipality, while the crown refers to the village‚Äôs name, K√∂nigsau (K√∂nig means ‚Äúking‚Äù in German). On 19 October 1978, municipal council gave the graphic artist Brust from Kirn-Sulzbach the task of designing a municipal coat of arms. At a council meeting on 11 May 1979, council adopted the design that had been put forth. After consent by the state archive, the Ministry of the Interior in Mainz granted approval for Kellenbach to bear its own arms on 15 August 1979.Statistische Mappen, VG Kirn-Land, 2009Description and explanation of K√∂nigsau‚Äôs arms The municipal banner also bears this coat of arms in the centre.Municipal banner Culture and sightseeing =Clubs= Since it is a very small place, K√∂nigsau does not have much of a club life, but it does have three clubs, although one is shared with neighbouring Kellenbach: *Freunde und F√∂rderer der freiwilligen Feuerwehr K√∂nigsau ‚Äî volunteer fire brigade promotional association *Heimatverein K√∂nigsau ‚Äî local history club *TuS K√∂nigsau-Kellenbach e.V. ‚Äî gymnastic and sport club Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Running through the village is Bundesstra√üe 421.

It varies regularly in brightness between extremes of magnitude 7.2 and 14 every 14 months. Variability Pulsations of S Orionis, showing dust production and masers (ESO) S Orionis is a Mira variable that pulsates with an approximately 420‚Äëday cycle, and varies in radius from 2.0 to 2.3 astronomical units. The pulsations have been observed using VLTI and VLBA observations which measured an angular diameter varying between 7.9 and 9.7 mas. The mean period of variation has been shown to change over time, from less than 410 days to over 440 days. The variations are approximately sinusoidal with a weak, not statistically-significant, trend towards longer period. The cycle of period changes is around 70 years within a total observation period of only about 100 years, so it is difficult to be certain about long-term behaviour. However, this behaviour is not expected to be the result of thermal pulses or evolutionary changes, and the cause is unknown. Companion S Orionis is listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog as a double star with a tenth magnitude companion 47\\" away. The companion is G0 star HD 294176. Circumstellar environment S Orionis is surrounded by masers and dust condensed from its cool stellar wind. The size of the dust shells varies as the star pulsates and changes temperature, from around 8 AU to 10 AU across. The positions of the masers have been measured very accurately using VLBI.

Biography Imam was born in Kyrgyzstan in 1957 to Chechen parents, who had been relocated as a result of the forced deportations of most Chechens and Ingush to Central Asia on February 23, 1944. He returned to Chechnya and would graduate from a secondary school in the Chechen capital Grozny. Alimsultanov would later graduate from the Polytechnic Institute in Rostov, and work as a land reclamation expert. Alimsultanov started his musical career in the mid-1980s, where he would pass on music folktales and tales of Chechen heroes with his songs. He also wrote songs to poems written by Umar Yarycheva, Musa Geshaev, and other prominent Chechen poets. Unlike fellow Chechen bard Timur Mucuraev's songs, Imam's music tended to be closer to traditional Chechen music. Some of his most popular songs include \\"Gazavat\\", \\"Dagestan\\", \\"Distant Homeland Anthem\\", and \\"Chechnya\\". With the start of the First Chechen War in December 1994, Alimsultanov spoke to Chechen fighters, and at the request of Chechen President Dzhokar Dudayev, accompanied injured fighters to Turkey. Imam performed extensively in Istanbul, collecting money for injured Chechen fighters. After returning to Chechnya, as a chief negotiator Alimsultanov helped secured the release of 25 builders from Odessa, Ukraine, who were held hostage. After securing their release, Odessa Mayor Eduard Gurwits opened the Imam Music Hall Theatre, where Imam would be invited to perform five times. On the night of November 10, 1996, three men in police uniform burst into the Odessa house where Alimsultanov and his artistic team were staying, shooting Imam and two colleagues at close range. All three died, but one witness, who was in the bathroom at the time of the murder, survived. The murder remains unresolved. In one version of the Ukrainian law enforcement, the murder had no political motive; however, an investigation by Chechen special services implicated the Russian FSB for the murder. Imam Alimsultanov was buried near his hometown of Khasavyurt, Dagestan, and a street in the same city was renamed in his honor.

Susana Gonz√°lez and V√≠ctor Noriega starred as protagonists, while Eugenia Cauduro, Alba Roversi, Susana Dosamantes, V√≠ctor Gonz√°lez and Gabriela Vergara starred as antagonists. Plot Maria Liz lives in a poor neighborhood in Mexico City with her English grandfather, Henry Alexander. Mr. Alexander was once rich, but lost his fortune in a stock market crash. This, combined with the loss of his wife, sent him into a mental decline. With effort and determination, Maria Liz managed to finish her studies and became a nurse, although she does not live her dream to study medicine. Maria Liz also helps her boyfriend, Marcelo, who studies engineering. But, Marcelo is an egotistical man who only thinks about finishing his career and leaving the neighborhood as soon as he obtains a good job, forgetting the sacrifices that his parents and Maria Liz have made. In an elegant district of the city, Sebasti√°n lives with his mother, Do√±a Lucrecia. Sebasti√°n is a civil engineer and a working man. He detests the false world in which his mother lives due to the fortune that she inherited from her husband for her political family. Marcelo finds a job as a construction worker at the construction site where Sebasti√°n works and immediately forgets his promise of marriage to Maria Liz. He begins to try to take away everything Sebasti√°n has, including Sebasti√°n's position at the construction company and his girlfriend, Araceli, who is the daughter of the owner of the construction company. When the child of a construction worker is injured at the work site, Sebasti√°n takes him to the hospital where Maria Liz works. Although their first encounter is conflicting, Sebasti√°n realizes that she is a very good nurse and soon helps her so that she takes care of his mother. But Do√±a Lucrecia begins to make his life a living hell when she finds out that Sebasti√°n has fallen in love with Maria Liz, and she loves him back. Do√±a Lucrecia wants the economic security and the social level that Maria Liz obtains that the selfish and superficial Araceli could give him, thus she is allied with a fellow nurse of Mar√≠a Liz, Rosal√≠a, who always hated Mar√≠a Liz because Dr. Arnaldo Herrera is in love with her when Rosal√≠a loved him. In spite of the obstacles that Araceli, Lucrecia and Rosal√≠a put to them to test their love, but they do not manage to separate them. They decide to get married and problems begin when the villainous Luciano sets a trap for Miguel Augusto that leads him to commit suicide. Sebasti√°n and Mar√≠a Liz are set be married, but because of an emergency, Sebasti√°n is late to the wedding, and Mar√≠a Liz thinks he has changed his mind and has decided to marry Araceli instead. A doctor, who is treating Marcelo to help get him ready for the leg operation he needs, falls madly in love with Mar√≠a Liz and is insanely jealous of Sebasti√°n, More so when he discovers that she has gotten pregnant by Sebasti√°n. Araceli is also pregnant by Sebasti√°n, having gotten him drunk to serve her purposes, but her careless lifestyle and excessive drinking cause her to miscarry. Realizing that a child is the only thing that would keep Sebastian from walking out on her (he's just learned of Maria Liz's pregnancy), she enlists the help of Lucrecia and Rosal√≠a. They kidnap Maria Liz and take her to a clinic where a C-Section is performed on her, and the child is taken from her womb. Rosalia then removes Araceli's name from her medical report and replaces it with Maria Liz's, making it appear that Maria Liz is the negligent one, not Araceli. Maria Liz protests her innocence, but Sebastian refuses to believe her, and declares that he never wants to see her again. Heartbroken, she leaves to study medicine in London, returning several years later a full-fledged doctor. In the meantime, however, Sebastian realizes the truth about Araceli, and that Maria Liz was telling the truth all along. He divorces Araceli, but she gets custody of the 2 children, Vanessa and Liliana. She marries Marcelo soon after, but it is a loveless marriage, and Vanessa & Liliana are physically and mentally abused by both of them.

History The Casa Blanca or White House was part of a settlement established at the site around 1754 by Tom√°s S√°nchez de la Barrera y Gallardo, captain of Laredo, who was ordered to find a suitable site for a new settlement. After surveying the country S√°nchez selected a site on the banks of Pe√±itas Creek. A settlement was established there, and the White House was constructed of caliche blocks known as ciares. The house was built in the shape of a square with a courtyard in the center; the well in the courtyard also served as the end of a tunnel out of the building. Toward the end of the eighteenth century the house was used as a mission. The Spanish crown granted the land to Juan Jos√© de la Garza Montemayor and his sons Agust√≠n, Perfecto, and Manuel on April 2, 1807. They used the Casa Blanca as a ranchhouse. According to records the land was occupied by their heirs until 1852. However, local legend has it that the Montemayor family was driven away by a band of outlaws, who in turn were driven out by hostile Indians. Subsequently various families occupied the house and the surrounding area, and a post office operated at the site from 1860 to 1866. The area continued to be inhabited by several families. In 1876 the land was purchased by John L. Wade. Because Casa Blanca was already established as a stopping point Wade established Wade City adjacent to it, platting streets and setting aside land for stores and churches. In 1893, the post office was reactivated. In 1896 Casa Blanca-Wade City had a combined estimated population of 150, a Methodist church, a general store, a gin, and a lumberyard. Wade City did not prosper, however, and by 1914 its population had decreased to thirty-five. The post office ceased operation in 1922. Around 1936 Wade's heirs petitioned for the site of Wade City to revert to them, arguing that the town never developed and showed no promise of doing so and that the land would be more valuable as ranchland. The petition was granted, and Wade City reverted to pastureland; Casa Blanca continued to be an independent community, but by 1945 only ruins remained. The first dam created was called Las Frutas in 1929. In 1945, the state attempted to eminent domain to dam more of the Nueces River which was fought until 1955 at which point the state prevailed and was able to dam the river to become the water supply for Corpus Christi and thus flooding and making unusable a little over of the Wade Ranch. The Wade Ranch was actually in operation from 1898 (Upon John Wade's death in 1898, the land was divided among his family. Wallis inherited the land. Wallis and Lou Ella married in 1894.) until Lou Ella Wade's death (96 years) in 1973. At that point it was broken up and most of the property became owned by numerous heirs through joint tenancy. The last heirs were bought out in about 2004, which meant that for the first time since about 1864, no Wade heir owned the property. Records from the ranch currently reside at Texas A&M; \\\\- Kingsville and are only open by appointment.

Examples of relevant processes Climate processes largely control the distribution, size, shape and properties of living organisms on Earth. For instance, the general circulation of the atmosphere on a planetary scale broadly determines the location of large deserts or the regions subject to frequent precipitation, which, in turn, greatly determine which organisms can naturally survive in these environments. Furthermore, changes in climates, whether due to natural processes or to human interferences, may progressively modify these habitats and cause overpopulation or extinction of indigenous species. The biosphere, for its part, and in particular continental vegetation, which constitutes over 99% of the total biomass, has played a critical role in establishing and maintaining the chemical composition of the Earth's atmosphere, especially during the early evolution of the planet (See History of Earth for more details on this topic). Currently, the terrestrial vegetation exchanges some 60 billion tons of carbon with the atmosphere on an annual basis (through processes of carbon fixation and carbon respiration), thereby playing a critical role in the carbon cycle. On a global and annual basis, small imbalances between these two major fluxes, as do occur through changes in land cover and land use, contribute to the current increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Laid down on 15 November 1918 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and launched on 28 April 1919, USS Sandpiper (Minesweeper No.51) was commissioned on 9 October 1919, redesignated AM-51 on 17 February 1920, and reclassified as a Small Seaplane Tender, AVP-9 on 22 January 1936.  USS Sandpiper mission  Although built as a minesweeper, Sandpiper performed aircraft tender duties throughout her career. Her assignments moved her from Train, Scouting Fleet; to Aircraft Squadrons, Scouting Fleet; to Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet; to various individual squadrons and finally to patrol units and training commands. Her duties ‚Äî initially restricted to guarding plane flights, fueling planes, and towing seaplane barges ‚Äî were gradually expanded. Transportation of aviation spares and personnel came with extended operations and new bases. Salvage and repair duties were added to her search and rescue work and were retained until ships designed for the purpose were built in the 1930s. The minesweeper/aircraft tender, however, was designated AM-51 in July 1920 and retained that hull number for over 15 years. On 22 January 1936, she was officially reclassified as a small seaplane tender and redesignated AVP-9.  North Atlantic operations  Based at New York City and then at Norfolk, Virginia, through the 1920s and into the 1930s, Sandpiper operated with the fleet, off the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts during the summer and fall and in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico during the winter. Each spring, she returned north. While deployed for winter maneuvers, she participated in annual fleet problems, including problems I (February 1923) and IX (January 1929) in which the use of aircraft allowed the attacking force to break through, and render obsolete, the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone.  Pacific Ocean operations  In January 1932, Sandpiper was reassigned to the Pacific and, for several years after her arrival on 20 February at San Diego, California, her new base, she provided services for seaplanes along the west coast. During the summer of 1935, she served with the Navy's Aleutian Survey Expedition as it concluded extensive surveys of the Andreanof and Rat Island groups and used aircraft equipped with multi-lens cameras to expand cartographic data on the chain and to improve methods of aerial photogrammetry.  Central American operations  Toward the end of the decade, Sandpiper shifted to the Panama Canal Zone. From Coco Solo, her duties took her along the Central and South American coasts for survey expeditions and exercises and into the Caribbean for temporary assignments to various patrol units stationed in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. During 1940 and 1941, she was attached to the Caribbean bases, particularly Trinidad, more frequently and for extended periods. With the entry of the United States into World War II, her previously limited escort duties were increased.  World War II North Atlantic operations  Sandpiper remained in the Caribbean into the spring of 1942. She then underwent repairs and overhaul at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Charleston, South Carolina. In October, she moved north to Boston, Massachusetts, whence she continued on to Greenland, arriving at Kangat Bay on 11 November. For the next four months, she conducted escort runs between Kangat Bay and Narsarsuaq; carried out search and rescue missions; and performed local defense duties.  Damaged in ship collision  In March 1943, she returned to Boston, Massachusetts; then, at the end of the month, she proceeded to Casco Bay where she conducted exercises for students at the Anti- submarine Training School. In June, she again moved north to Argentia, Newfoundland, whence she escorted and carried aviation fuel for . On the 23rd, however, while operating to the south of Cape Farewell, she was rammed on the port quarter by a British merchant ship which tore a hole in her hull and seriously damaged her steering gear. Emergency repairs enabled her to reach Argentia, whence she was routed, via Sydney and Halifax, to Boston, Massachusetts, to complete the work.  World War II South Atlantic operations  On 28 August, Sandpiper cleared Boston harbor and sailed south to Brazil for duty with Fleet Air Wing 16. She arrived at Recife, Brazil, on 30 September; and, for the next nine months, served as a support ship carrying supplies to various bases along the Brazilian coast. In June 1944, she returned to the United States; underwent overhaul at Norfolk, Virginia; and, in September, got underway for Key West, Florida, where she remained, attached to the Training Detachment, Fleet Air Wing 5, until after the end of the war in Europe. End-of-war activities In late June 1945, Sandpiper returned to Norfolk, Virginia, whence, after brief duty as a target-towing ship, she was ordered to Pearl Harbor. She arrived in Hawaii on 17 August, two days after the end of hostilities in the Pacific. A month later, she was ordered back to the east coast and steamed, via San Diego, California, and the Panama Canal, to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving there at the end of October. Decommissioning Sandpiper was decommissioned on 10 December 1945 at Boston, Massachusetts, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 April 1946, and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 12 October 1946 for disposal.

It is located in the non-administrative Z√°horie Region in West Slovakia. The Landscape Area protects 275.22 km¬≤ (106.26 mi¬≤) and is divided into two separate parts ‚Äì western and north-eastern. The western part starts near the village of K√∫ty in the north, follows the borders between Slovakia and Austria alongside the Morava River and ends near Stupava in the south. The north-eastern part is bordered by the Military District of Z√°horie in the east and south. Geography, geology and ecology The western part of the Landscape Area is formed by the Morava River and mainly consists of vast riparian zones and floodplains. This area is well preserved because it had been a strictly prohibited border between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc for 40 years, known as the Iron Curtain. The area contains the largest water-meadows in Slovakia. The riparian forests, mainly in Horn√Ω les and Doln√Ω les, contain trees similar to the original old growth forests. A vast network of channels, wetlands and small lakes is spread in the riparian zones and floodplains. These rich and dynamic geographical features bring an extensive variety of flora and fauna. Plants are represented by, for example, large areas of Clematis integrifolia. The water habitat is dominantly occupied by animal groups such as crustaceans, molluscs, fish, amphibians and a lot of species of aquatic birds. The European beaver returned to this area from Austria, where it was reintroduced in the 1980s. Wetlands alongside the Morava River The north-eastern part contains sand deposited by aeolian processes, which create dunes. Because of its location, this area is an important route for migrating birds. The contrast between colder lower areas and warm sand dunes creates a bright variety of species. The warm and dry areas are home to the antlion and hoopoe. The fir forests are home to insect predators, which serve as a feeding ground for the European nightjar, woodlark and bats. Tourism In the western part, the artificial levee alongside the Morava River and adjacent newly built biking trail contains boards and posters informing about wildlife and is also popular with hikers. The north-eastern part contains biking and hiking trails, offering unique sand dunes. Biking trails are interconnected with others outside the Landscape Area.

From launch in Devon in 1959 until a major refurbishment in 2001, she was named MV Mountwood. MV Mountwood The Mountwood was the slightly older sister ship of the MV Woodchurch. Both of the ferries were built for the Corporation of Birkenhead to replace the existing fleet of 1930s steamers. The designs of the two new vessels were loosely based on the ferries Leasowe and Egremont of the Wallasey Corporation; they were designed by the same company, Graham and Woolnough, and were built at the same shipyard, Messrs. Philip and Sons Ltd. of Dartmouth. Mountwood was launched by Mrs Hugh Platt on the 6 July 1959 into the River Dart, and after being fitted out was delivered to the Mersey in 1960. She was named after an overspill post-war housing development of Birkenhead. The Mountwood and her identical sister Woodchurch originally had bright orange funnels with a black base and black soot buffer. On the main deck, there was a forward, heated shelter and also a main saloon, aft of this was the toilets and machine space. Below was a saloon bar. On the top deck was a large open promenade and a forward shelter beneath the bridge, although this shelter was open beneath the bridge so it was often breezy and cold. They had a main central wheelhouse and two side cabs, and power came from two medium speed Crossley 8-cylinder diesel engines. Upon the bridge deck, in the wheelhouse, one would find the large brass helm and steering pedestal, a binnacle, and two conjoined Chadburn Synchrostep engine order telegraphs. These were linked to the other two identical telegraphs in the docking cabs so they moved in tandem. There was also whistle controls and lighting controls. In the docking cabs or navigation boxes was another binnacle, a whistle control and also various indicators for engine/speed etc. Originally all ferries had a simple ship to shore communicating radio, but did not have radar or sonar. The wheelhouses of the two ferries differed slightly due to different positioning of rudder angle indicators and engine RPM gauges in the bridge wings. The telegraphs were designed to give the captain direct control of the engines (although they could still be used in the traditional signal / response manner) and as such were marked with commands such as 'brake'and 'start'. They also had more speed settings ahead and astern. The original engines could reach full speed within 3 seconds once 'run' had been passed. In her early years Mountwood was an unreliable ship, breaking down several times whilst crossing the river and having to anchor. In May 1961, she suffered a main engine failure, with her passengers having to be rescued by Woodchurch. She also collided with Bidston whilst berthing, due to a communications error. The new Mountwood had two options of engine control. The first was direct control, where the bridge telegraphs controlled the engines directly, without the assistance of an engineer at the control board. The second option was the traditional system of telegraph orders between the engineers and the engines. On this day, the Mountwood was operating in the traditional way. It seemed as though the duty engineer carried out the wrong order and started the engines in the wrong direction resulting in a collision. There should have been a ‚Äòwrong way‚Äô alarm which sounded however either the engineer failed to hear it or, for some reason, it was not working. The Mountwood remained in operation up until she was withdrawn for refurbishment in 1989. She was rewired, internally refurbished and her bridge wheelhouse and cabs were plated over to form one large navigation bridge, although she retained all the original equipment. The original Crossley engines were retained but heavily overhauled and the central saloon saw modifications in the form of a cafe. The most noticeable change was the colour of the funnel, flame red and black, harking back to the 1920s Birkenhead steamships. The new 'Mersey Ferries' logo was painted on each side of the funnel. The Mountwood returned to service in July 1990 and remained in operation up until 2001 when she was withdrawn from service for a major refit. Her only major work during the period 1990‚Äì2001 was the addition of a shelter abaft the bridge, which also had a small bridge deck area. The black band on the funnel was reduced and the logo resized giving the ferry a small looking funnel. Major Refit In 2001, the Mountwood was withdrawn and taken to Birkenhead's former Cammell Laird shipyard (which became owned by A&P;), and then to Clarence graving docks, where she was stripped of her fittings and parts of her superstructure were removed and rebuilt. Unfortunately the ferry remained dormant for some time due to problems at the shipyard. She was then re-engined and rebuilt. Noticeable changes were the addition of a new, angle fronted, large wheelhouse and bridge deck, plus her funnel, which was reinstated after the refit, was moved further back to fit with the position of the new engines. Her central saloons were also extended to the full width of the ship. She looks quite similar the Woodchurch's refit to Snowdrop. The vessels original helm and central binnacle were reinstated and some of the other bridge items are now in Mersey Ferries‚Äô collection. In May 2011 the ferry's nameplate was replaced and it now carried the words 'Royal Iris' in Birkenhead Corporation style script font. MV Royal Iris of the Mersey MV Royal Iris of the Mersey in February 2020 Today the Royal Iris of the Mersey is a regular vessel used on both cross-river ferry services and also Manchester ship canal cruises. The ferry has a top speed of 12 knots. The ferry can't be named just \\"Royal Iris\\" as the previous vessel of that name (the ) is still listed on Lloyd's Register of Shipping in the same class. The ferry still retains many features from her days as Mountwood including the original pair of Kockums Supertyfon fog horns, as does her sister ship. Since her major refit in 2001, ongoing maintenance has been completed, including refurbishments to her saloons and the replacement of the timber decking on the top deck. Incidents The vessel has been involved other incidents aside from the collision with Bidston. She had a complete engine failure due to a faulty fuel pump and had to anchor in the river when she was brand new. On 10 July 2016, she unfortunately struck an underwater obstruction and took on water whilst waiting for another vessel to leave the entrance to the Manchester Ship Canal. All 75 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the ship on to the dredger . In popular culture The Mountwood was used in the film Ferry Cross The Mersey, a musical named after the Gerry & The Pacemakers song. It also appeared in the opening titles for the television series, The Liver Birds.

She was subsequently captured by the French ship H√©ros off Sumatra, on 21 January 1782.  British career  In October 1781, off Cape of Good Hope, Hannibal encountered the French frigate Bellone, escorting the transports Neker and S√©v√®re. She captured the transports and brought them to Saint Helena. On 7 December 1781, a French fleet under d'Orves sortied Isle de France, with 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes. On 19 January, the 64-gun S√©v√®re detected HMS Hannibal, under Captain Christy. D'Orves detached the 74-gun H√©ros and the 64-gun Art√©sien, under Suffren, to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman Hinchinbrooke, until Hannibal made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandoned the pursuit to rejoin his fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered Hannibal again, and again detached H√©ros, Art√©sien and Vengeur, but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender.  French career  Hannibal was brought into French service as Petit Annibal, to distinguish her from the eponymous 74-gun Annibal, which happened to serve in d'Orves' fleet. English-language histories often refer to her as Hannibal for this reason. Lieutenant de Ruyter, first officer of H√©ros, was given command, and all the warships in the French fleet send a detachment as to constitute a crew capable of manning Annibal as a warship, Lawriston notably providing a company of the R√©giment de hussards de Lauzun. After Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves died on 9 February 1782 and he assumed command of the French forces in the Indian Ocean, Suffren put Captain Morard de Galles in command, while De Ruyter took command of Pourvoyeuse. Annibal saw service in his five battles with British Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in 1782 and 1783. At the Battle of Providien, Petit Annibal was third in the French line, behind Art√©sien (Captain de Maurville). She came within pistol range of his opposite number, HMS Eagle (Captain Reddel) before opening fire. Her captain, Morard de Galles, was wounded by shrapnel but he kept his station. In January 1783, she was under Beaulieu.  Fate  Petit Annibal was decommissioned in 1787 and used as a hulk from 1792.

It is based in the silver mining city of Pachuca, in the state of Hidalgo, in Mexico.  History  Anfora was founded in 1920 by Pablo Schmidt, Alberto Lenz, Julio Vermehren, Carlos Reichert, Enrique Hilger, Federico Ritter and Adolfo Goerz in Mexico City as a porcelain manufacturer for home and institutional ceramic dinnerware. After the Mexican Revolution, Anfora grew its production through German technology and Mexican labor, eventually coming to dominate the Mexican market for this type of products. In 1932, Anfora started to manufacture sanitaryware for the construction market. During World War II, the Mexican government under L√°zaro C√°rdenas intervened the company as the original owners were of German nationality. After a tumultuous period of poor decisions and lack of investment by government officials, the company was sold in 1947 to local investors. The period of explosive post-war growth, plus its installed infrastructure, allowed Anfora to grow exponentially and become a household name. In 1994, the factory moved to a facility in Pachuca, where it continues to operate with over 1,000 people in 2020.  Markets  The company sells in Mexico through a network of distributors and wholesalers. In the USA, it is represented exclusively by Steelite for the foodservice market, where it competes against local factories like Homer Laughlin and Hall China. Home use dinnerware is sold through retailers like Pottery Barn and Williams Sonoma. One of the most traditional Anfora pattern is the hand painted Blue and White Puebla, sold as a collector's dinnerware through individuals on eBay. Other customers include Starbucks and Mexican restaurants like Sanborns, Las Ma√±anitas and San Angel Inn. In Japan, Anfora is represented by The Harvest Kitchen Store as well as by Royal Bussan. European markets are served through Steelite UK, while Latin America has its share of local importers.

Praised internationally as \\"An important contribution to American literature,\\" the novel tells the story of Mariquita, a Colombian village that's forever altered the day a band of communist guerrillas takes out all but three of its men. Left to fend for themselves, the abandoned women slowly emerge from their supporting roles as wives and daughters to become unwitting founders of a radically socialist society, a metamorphosis that Kirkus Reviews has described as \\"Slyly pushing the envelope that Aristophanes opened with Lysistrata.\\" Ca√±√≥n's novel has been published in over twenty countries and translated into French, German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Hebrew, Korean, Turkish, Arabic, Croatian and Polish. The film adaptation of it, called Without Men, was released in 2011. The cast included Eva Longoria and Chris Slater, and was directed by Gabriela Tagliavini. =Essays= Se Perdre (et se trouver) dans la Traduction, Les Assises Internationales du Roman 2008 : Le roman, quelle invention !

He studied medicine in Utrecht, and in 1901 become a professor of medicine at the University of Groningen. Later he was a professor at the Universities of Strasbourg (1911‚Äì14) and Vienna (1914‚Äì29).  Contributions in cardiology  Wenckebach is primarily remembered for his work in cardiology. In 1899 he provided a description of irregular pulses due to partial blockage of atrioventricular conduction, creating a progressive lengthening of conduction time in cardiac tissue. The condition was referred to as a \\"second degree AV block\\" and later named the \\"Wenckebach phenomenon\\" and reclassified as Mobitz type I block in Mobitz's 1924 paper. A similar phenomenon can also occur in the Sinoatrial node where it gives rise to Type I second degree SA block, and this is also known as a Wenckebach block; the two have distinct features on an ECG however. Sinus rhythm with acute inferior infarction complicated by Type I A-V block manifest in the form of 5:4 Wenckebach periods; R-P/P-R reciprocity. Wenckebach is credited for describing the median bundle of the heart's conductive system that connects the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node. This bundle was named Wenckebach's bundle, and is also known as the middle internodal tract. Wenckebach's bundle is one of the three internodal pathways, the others being the \\"posterior internodal tract\\" (Thorel's pathway), and the \\"anterior internodal tract\\" (some fibers of which also project to Bachmann's bundle, and then into the left atrium). Wenckebach was an early advocate involving the use of quinine for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Family His father Eduard (1813-1874) has been credited with developing the very first telegraphic communications line in the Netherlands, between Haarlem and Amsterdam. He had two brothers, Henri Johan Eduard (1861-1924), director of the State Mines and later of the Dutch Ironworks in IJmuiden, and Ludwig Willem Reymert (1860-1937), a well-known painter and book illustrator. His son Oswald became a sculptor, painter and medallist, most widely known for his war monuments and designing the Dutch coins issued between 1948 and 1981.

He made his debut in the top division in 1998, and his highest rank was sekiwake. He holds the record for the most consecutive tournaments ranked in the junior san'yaku ranks of sekiwake and komusubi (19 from 2002 until 2005). He won ten special prizes and was twice runner-up in a tournament. He earned two gold stars for defeating yokozuna at a maegashira rank. He had 1691 career bouts, sixth on the all-time list. He retired in 2015 and was a coach at Tagonoura stable, until opening his own Nishiiwa stable in February 2018. Early life and sumo background He first tried sumo in the third grade when he entered a competition for fourth graders and up and came in third. By middle school he was training every day at a sumo dojo. He met Takahanada (later the 64th yokozuna Takanohana) when a regional tour came to Hirozaki City, getting into the ring with him. He entered professional sumo in March 1992 after completing middle school, although he had been admitted to Hirosaki Jitsygyo High School. He had received offers from four or five different heya upon his graduation, but the small and relatively new Naruto stable appealed to him. Career As with many sumo wrestlers, he initially competed under his family name, Kogawa, but upon reaching the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in November 1997 he was given the fighting name of Wakanosato, reminiscent of his stablemaster, former yokozuna Takanosato. Kotomitsuki He entered the top makuuchi division for the first time in May 1998. He recorded his first kinboshi or gold star win against yokozuna Wakanohana in the November 1998 tournament, but the next day he broke his ankle in a match with Mus≈çyama and had to miss the last day of the tournament and all of the next. He suffered a more serious injury in November 1999, rupturing anterior cruciate ligaments. He sat out two successive tournaments after having surgery and was demoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division . He won consecutive j≈´ry≈ç championships upon his comeback, in May and July 2000, and was promoted back to makuuchi in September. He quickly made the titled san'yaku ranks, making komusubi in November 2000 and recovering from 2‚Äì6 down to finish 9‚Äì6. As a result, he was promoted to sekiwake for the first time in January 2001. In his early top division career, Wakanosato was considered a promising candidate for ≈çzeki. From January 2002 until January 2005 he spent 19 consecutive tournaments ranked at either komusubi or sekiwake, an all-time record. However, he was never able to break through the \\"great barrier\\" (the literal meaning of ≈çzeki), just failing to attain the necessary 33 wins over three tournaments. He was runner-up in the January 2003 tournament, and again in September 2003, where his 11‚Äì4 score was probably his best chance to make ≈çzeki. However, he could only manage seven wins in the following tournament. He was never able to consistently beat the top ranked wrestlers, being unable to beat Takanohana in nine attempts and winning only five times out of 32 meetings against ≈çzeki Chiyotaikai. He initially had an excellent head-to-head record against Hakuh≈ç, defeating him the first six times they met. However, the last of these victories came in 2005 and he subsequently lost eleven in a row against him. He was awarded ten sansh≈ç or special prizes for good performances in tournaments during his career. In later years on the dohy≈ç he again had injury problems, being forced to withdraw from his final san'yaku- ranked tournament in September 2005 and missing all of the next. He defeated yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ on the second day of the 2006 May tournament, his first kinboshi in 45 tournaments (only Kirinji, with 47 tournaments, has had a longer wait between kinboshi) but he could only manage a 6‚Äì9 record overall. He was then again forced to sit out all of the September 2006 tournament and fell to the second division once again. However, he made something of a comeback in May 2007, turning in a strong 10‚Äì5 record at maegashira 7. He won his 600th career bout in September 2007, and turned in another good performance in May 2008, again finishing on 10‚Äì5. Wakanosato winning by tsuridashi, or lift out He withdrew from the March 2009 tournament after breaking a metatarsal bone in his right foot during his 11th day bout with Kotosh≈çgiku. He had surgery on 8 April which put him out of action for at least two months, meaning he had to sit out the following tournament in May. He came back very strongly in July, winning his fourth j≈´ry≈ç championship with a 14‚Äì1 record. He reached maegashira 1 in March 2010, his highest rank in over four years. After that he comfortably maintained a position in the mid-to- upper maegashira ranks until he was injured in the November 2011 tournament, resulting in yet another fall to j≈´ry≈ç. However he immediately returned to makuuchi after scoring 11‚Äì4 in January 2012. After a poor 4‚Äì11 record at maegashira 15 in September 2013, Wakanosato was once again demoted to j≈´ry≈ç, but for the first time for a non injury-related reason. He was ranked in makuuchi only one more time after that, in the July 2014 tournament. Retirement from sumo Following a 4‚Äì11 result in j≈´ry≈ç in July 2015 which guaranteed a further relegation to the makushita division, Wakanosato announced his retirement on 3 September. He told a press conference \\"I entered this career out of my love for sumo, and it has been enjoyable. I'm being sincere in saying I want to continue, but my body is not up to the task of matching my desire.\\" He had already purchased a toshiyori-kabu or elder stock in the Japan Sumo Association and is now known as Nishiiwa Oyakata. He initially worked at his old stable, now renamed Tagonoura. His official retirement ceremony or danpatsu-shiki was held at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on 28 May 2016. Wakanosato's application to open his own Nishiiwa stable was approved by the Sumo Association on 30 November 2017, and the stable opened on 1 February 2018. As of March 2019 it has six wrestlers, all in the lower divisions. Fighting style Wakanosato specialised in yotsu-sumo, or techniques that involve grabbing hold of the opponent's mawashi. He was known as being particularly difficult to beat once he had a migi-yotsu, or right hand inside, left hand outside grip. About 40 percent of his wins were by yori kiri, or force out, but he was also good at pushing and thrusting, winning many bouts by oshi-dashi or push out. His two most commonly used throws were sukuinage (scoop throw) and uwatenage (overarm throw). Family Wakanosato was married in April 2004.

Among the earliest supporters of the New York and Erie Railroad were prominent Jamestown residents who lobbied for the railroad to go through their town. Unfortunately for Jamestown, after much debate, the route chosen by the railroad bypassed Jamestown by 35 miles in favor of Salamanca, Dayton and Dunkirk. After being snubbed by the New York and Erie, townspeople met on June 27, 1851 in Jamestown and on June 30, 1851 a petition for a charter for the Erie and New York City Railroad was published. The road was to be built from West Salamanca, through Randolph and Jamestown, to the Pennsylvania state line. Work began on the line began in Randolph on May 19, 1853 and was abandoned on January 5, 1855 for lack of funds. On May 7, 1859 the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in New York was chartered with William Reynolds as its president. One of the first actions of the A&GW; was to purchase the Erie and New York City Railroad in 1860. According to the \\"First Annual Report of The Atlantic & Great Western Railway\\", the A&GW; assumed $14,000 of 7 percent bonds upon the purchase of the Erie and New York City and received 3 locomotives, 2 passenger cars, and 40 freight cars from the contractors building the Erie and New York City.

Recorded since the 13th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, then rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. The rebuilt church was demolished in 1885. The middle ages St. Matthew was the only church in the City of London dedicated to the apostle and patron saint of accountants. Friday Street was so named, according to John Stow, after the fishmongers living there, although none are recorded in the parish records. Cheapside was the principal market street of medieval London (‚Äúcheap‚Äù meaning market) and many of the lesser streets running off were called after the commodity sold there, such as Milk Street, Bread Street and Wood Street. It is more likely, therefore, that Friday Street was so called from fishmongers vending, rather than living there. The earliest surviving reference to the church is in a document from the reign of Henry III, as ‚ÄúSt Matthew in Fridaistret‚Äù. A document from 1381‚Äì1382 refers to the church as ‚ÄúSt. Matthew in Chepe‚Äù. Seventeenth century In 1631, Hugh Myddleton, the entrepreneur who had engineered the New River to supply water to London (and which still survives between Hertfordshire and Stoke Newington) was buried in St. Matthew Friday Street. He had been a parishioner and churchwarden. When the church was demolished, 254 years later, an unsuccessful attempt was made to find his monument and coffin. During this time, the rector of St. Matthew's was the puritan divine Henry Burton. In 1636, he preached there that William Laud‚Äôs changes to church ritual were drawing the Church of England closer to popery and accused the bishops of being ‚Äúcaterpillars‚Äù, not pillars of the church. As a result, Burton was placed in a pillory and had his ears cut off. After Laud's fall and execution, Burton published ‚ÄúThe Grand Impostor Unmasked, or a detection of the notorious hypocrisie and desperate impiety of the late Archbishop (so styled) of Canterbury, cunningly couched in that written copy which he read on the scaffold‚Äù. St. Matthew's ties with the Dissenters survived the Restoration. By the Act of Uniformity 1662, the Book of Common Prayer was made compulsory in all churches. The churches minister Henry Hurst was ejected from the church. In his diary entry on the day the Act came into effect, Sunday 24 August 1662, Samuel Pepys recorded a visit to his uncle's house for dinner, and recounted: > Among other things they tell me that there hath been a disturbance in a > church in Friday Street; a great many young people knotting together and > crying out \\"Porridge\\" often and seditiously in the church, and took the > Common Prayer Book, they say, away; and, some say, did tear it; but it is a > thing which appears to me very ominous. I pray God avert it. \\"Porridge‚Äù was a Puritan term for the Book of Common Prayer. Four years‚Äô later, St. Matthew's, along with the great majority of the churches in the City, was destroyed in the Great Fire.\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert, C; Weinreb, D; Keay, J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993, 2008) Rebuilding after the Great Fire The parish was combined with that of nearby St Peter, Westcheap which was not rebuilt, its site being retained as a graveyard, which survives today as a public space off Cheapside. The Commissioners responsible for rebuilding the churches after the Fire contemplated moving St Matthew's to a more convenient location. This did not happen. Instead, the site of the church was augmented by a piece of parish land. Building commenced in 1682 and the church was complete by 1685, at a total cost of ¬£2,309. In addition to this amount, the combined parishes paid Wren a gratuity of ¬£3 8s. St. Matthew Friday Street was the smallest and cheapest of the Wren churches. Its plan was an irregular rectangle; George Godwin described the interior as \\"a plain room of most uneven shape, about 60 feet long and 30 feet broad within the walls, with a plain flat ceiling, slightly coved at the sides. There was a gallery at the west end with a small organ. The exterior walls were of brick, except for the east front, towards Friday Street, which was faced with stone. The east wall was unadorned at street level, but had a row of five round-headed windows with cherub-headed keystones above. The tower, in the south west corner, which was not visible from the street, was the plainest of any Wren church. It was plain brick and hung one bell. Entrance to the church was via alleyways to the north and south. St. Matthew's communion table and Royal Arms are now in St. Vedast- alias-Foster, while the font and pulpit are in St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe. Demolition Due to the move of population from the City to the suburbs in the second half of the nineteenth century, the church became redundant and was demolished in 1885 under the Union of Benefices Act 1860. The parish was joined to St Vedast alias Foster, the site sold for ¬£22,005, and the proceeds used to build St. Thomas Finsbury Park. The reredos, by Edward Pearce, was acquired by the London decorating firm of White, Allom & Company, who suggested to Margaret Greville (the Honorable Mrs. Ronald Greville: 1863‚Äì1942), a noted society hostess, that it should be rebuilt in the hall at Polesden Lacey, her house at Great Bookham, near Dorking in Surrey ‚Äì where it remains. It has a segmental pediment on two Corinthian columns, framing two round-headed panels, which originally framed the Ten Commandments The section of Friday Street on which the church formerly stood was destroyed during the Second World War. The street was built over by the New Change Buildings in the 1950s, the site of St. Matthew's being in the courtyard. The site has since been redeveloped.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Kirner Land, whose seat is in the town of Kirn. Geography =Location= Meckenbach lies in the northern foothills of the North Palatine Uplands in a side dale of the Nahe. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Meckenbach's neighbours are the municipalities of Hochstetten-Dhaun, Merxheim and Heimweiler and the town of Kirn, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. History Only seldom is Meckenbach mentioned in old documents. In the church register, a Meckenbach clergyman wrote that the derivation of the village's name is even shrouded in darkness. It might be named after somebody named ‚ÄúMacko‚Äù, and would therefore mean ‚ÄúMacko‚Äôs Brook‚Äù, but this is not known for certain. The still current names for the village of ‚ÄúHofhaus‚Äù and ‚ÄúHofacker‚Äù (Hof can mean either ‚Äúestate‚Äù or ‚Äúfarm‚Äù in German, while Haus means ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and Acker means ‚Äúfield‚Äù, especially a cropfield) lead to the belief that the dale was settled with a few homesteads quite early on. In 1969-1970, an excavator being used in a gravel pit on the village's outskirts in the high-lying area known as ‚ÄúSchmidts Eich‚Äù brought up some square stone urns, such as are also kept at the Bad Kreuznach local history museum. They come from one of the 36 barrows. The stone urns, which according to Karoline Cauer's thinking were used in Roman burials, are held to be proof that the Meckenbacher Schmelze (‚ÄúMeckenbach smelter‚Äù) already existed in Roman times. Moreover, copper slag have been unearthed and entrances to former copper mining galleries have been found. Long before the Romans and the Germanic peoples, in prehistoric times, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age (La T√®ne times), the Celts who dwelt on both sides of the Rhine already knew how to smelt copper and iron ores. That in itself is enough to believe that there was a settlement at what is now Meckenbach even then. In 451, the Huns, who had thrust out of Central Asia, were driven out at the bloody Battle of the Catalaunian Plains near Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne on the Marne. They left behind them burnt houses and depopulated countryside as traces of their flight. When the Alamanni arrived, they found destroyed villages and neglected fields.History About 1000, Archbishop of Mainz and Imperial Archchancellor Willigis had a church built in Meckenbach, which was made subject to Disibodenberg Abbey. The original building is essential still preserved. It is a plain quarrystone building built in the Romanesque style with an east tower. The nave underwent an expansion about 1750. The church is also equipped with an organ from 1836, built by the Brothers Stumm from Rhaunensulzbach, which was renovated in 1981. The village always belonged in the Middle Ages to the Waldgravial Amt of Kyrburg, and in 1550 it became Calvinist. Even the peasants from Meckenbach had to pay the so-called Zollhafer (a toll in oats) to the Lords of Steinkallenfels whenever they wanted to sell their wares at Kirn Market. Until the late 18th century, Meckenbach was a Schulthei√üerei seat within the Oberamt of Kyrburg, where an official from the lordship provided the village administration as a Schulthei√ü in the name of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg. After French Revolutionary troops had overrun the German lands on the Rhine's left bank and imposed their own administrative system on the conquered lands, Meckenbach was assigned about 1800 to the newly formed Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Merxheim in the Canton of Meisenheim, also belonging to which were B√§rweiler, √úberhochstetten (Hochstetten) and Merxheim. This subsequently remained in force as the Oberschulthei√üerei of Merxheim within the Oberamt of Meisenheim once Napoleonic times were over and the village had passed under the terms of the Congress of Vienna to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. After the Oberamt of Meisenheim passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in September 1866, Meckenbach was assigned to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Meddersheim, wherein it remained until 1940, when it was assigned, along with Hochstetten, to the Amt of Kirn- Land.Statistische Mappen, Verbandsgemeinde Kirn-Land, 2009 Religion As at 31 October 2013, there are 394 full-time residents in Meckenbach, and of those, 304 are Evangelical (77.157%), 52 are Catholic (13.198%), 2 belong to the Mainz Free Religious Community (0.508%) and 36 (9.137%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Meckenbach's mayor is Klaus Willi Schlarb.Meckenbach‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: In gespaltenem Schild vorn in Schwarz neben sechs silbernen Sternen ein silbernes Wolfseisen, hinten in Gold ein blaubewerter und -gezungter roter L√∂we. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale sable a cramp palewise between six mullets palewise three and three, all argent, and Or a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure. The charges on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side, the mullets (six-pointed star shapes) and the cramp (or in German, Wolfsangel, commonly held to be a kind of wolf trap, although the interpretation in English heraldry is as a kind of structural strengthenerJames Parker on cramps) are drawn from an old 1698 Meckenbach court seal. The charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg. From times of yore right up until the last phase of the Napoleonic Wars, the wolf was the main threat among wild animals to man's well-being in the Nahe region, especially the Hunsr√ºck, filled as it was with gorges and woodland. In hard times brought on by war and harsh winters, packs of wolves became a frightful menace. The wolf was the epitome of deadly enmity and merciless bloodlust. Many knightly families, towns and municipalities in the Meckenbach region bear the Wolfsangel or Wolfseisen (‚Äúwolf hook‚Äù or ‚Äúwolf iron‚Äù) charge in their arms, surely as a mark of their homeland as an expression of their courage. In 1814, when the lands on the Rhine's left bank once again became German, the authorities gave strict instructions for fighting wolves. Wolves had become a menace once again in Napoleonic times, for they had been left alone to multiply, as later were the wild boars during and after the Second World War. In Meckenbach, the ‚ÄúWolfskaul‚Äù on the slope next to the mountain gorge recalls the danger from wolves in bygone days.Description and explanation of Meckenbach‚Äôs arms Municipal council, on 20 October 1963, gave the graphic artist Brust from Kirn-Sulzbach the task of designing a municipal coat of arms. At a council meeting on 17 July 1964, council adopted the design that had been put forth. After consent by the state archive, the Ministry of the Interior in Mainz granted approval for Meckenbach to bear its own arms on 14 May 1965.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bad Sobernheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. Meddersheim is a winegrowing village. Geography =Location= Meddersheim lies in the Nahe valley between Idar-Oberstein and Bad Kreuznach. South of the village is the edge of the North Palatine Uplands. The village is surrounded by fertile vineyards, cropfields and wooded heights. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Meddersheim's neighbours are the municipality of Nu√übaum, the town of Bad Sobernheim and the municipalities of Lauschied, B√§rweiler, Kirschroth, Merxheim and Monzingen, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Meddersheim are the outlying homesteads of Lohm√ºhle, Schliffgesm√ºhle, Am Meisenheimer Pfad and the ‚ÄúFelke-Kurhaus Menschel‚Äù (‚ÄúEnglischer Hof‚Äù).Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 17 (PDF; 2,2 MB) History The area that is now Meddersheim was settled as far back as Celtic and Roman times, and perhaps even earlier. Various archaeological finds of remnants of a Roman estate on R√∂merstra√üe (‚ÄúRoman road‚Äù), extensive foundations and an ancient watermain bear witness to this. The current clump village arose in Frankish times (6th century) at a favourable, flat site as a crossroads outside the River Nahe's floodplain. Until the 13th century, the village of Meddersheim belonged to the Archbishops of Mainz, then passing by way of pledge to the Waldgraves at the Kyrburg (castle). They held it until the French Revolutionary Wars in the late 18th century. It was administered by a Mainz Schulthei√ü who was responsible to the Burgrave at Disibodenberg, or beginning in 1240 in Sobernheim, and thereafter, beginning in 1279 at Castle B√∂ckelheim. In 1239, there was a serious dispute between the Archbishop and the Counts in the Nahe region, who opposed the Prince-Archbishop-Elector's political reach into the Nahe region. Moreover, there was the disagreement over the pledge of Meddersheim with Kirschroth, which was always bound with Meddersheim. Although the Archbishop redeemed both villages, the Waldgrave at the Kyrburg, as heir to the Counts of Saarbr√ºcken, did not wish to give them up. The Archbishop prevailed, but later, one of his successors pledged the Schulthei√üerei once again, this time for good. The feudal and tithing rights were always shared out among several lordships. The oldest part of the church, the steeple, comes from the 12th century, while the nave, after several conversions and additions, comes from 1756. Particularly worthy of mention are the pulpit from the 18th century, the 1753 Stumm organ and the 16th-century baptismal font. In 1798, the French overran the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank and imposed their own administrative system on the land. Meddersheim became the seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) in the Canton of Meisenheim, which also comprised Kirschroth and Staudernheim, and which lay in the Department of Sarre. No later than Napoleonic times, something akin to gavelkind ‚Äì equal division of land among heirs ‚Äì was introduced. This led to splintering of businesses and in many cases to impoverishment among smallhold farmers. After Napoleon had been driven out in 1814, Meddersheim was, after a short transitional time, assigned under the terms of the Congress of Vienna in 1816 to the Oberamt of Meisenheim, and it was then furthermore the seat of an Oberschulthei√üerei. Thus did Meddersheim become with the Oberamt of Meisenheim an exclave of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. In 1866, it passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Then, in 1869, the region passed to the Kingdom of Prussia, and Meddersheim now belonged to the Meisenheim district in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the Rhine Province. In 1919, after the First World War, the B√ºrgermeistereien (‚ÄúMayoralties‚Äù) of Meddersheim and Merxheim were merged. After the Meisenheim district was dissolved in 1932, the Amt (as it had been called since 1927) no longer existed. In 1935, Meddersheim had the same municipal administration ‚Äì as it were, a ‚Äúpersonal union‚Äù at the municipal level ‚Äì but in 1940, the former Amt of Meddersheim was merged with the Amt of Sobernheim, from which arose the Verbandsgemeinde of Sobernheim in 1969. On Lehmkaut (a street), remnants of a brickworks could still be seen until the 1960s. Made here, right in the village, were field-fired bricks. In Andreas Gottfried's former potter's shop, pottery was made until 1968. The flax that was extensively grown here on the heaths, whose poorer soils were subjected to controlled burns, was retted in a great flax-retting tank, which is believed to have been communally organized. In the area of Brechkaut and Brechl√∂cher (laneways?) there were major brick kilns, and at their ends lay the hot-air shaft measuring about 2 √ó 3 m on which the flax was retted so that it could then be scutched and heckled. The former herdsmen's houses of the herding association have been gone since the 1950s. Listed for a time within Meddersheim's limits were five mills and one pig farm. At the Ilsberg was a quarry. The red shale sandstone were quarried until some time towards the end of the 18th century, whereafter yellow-grey quarried sandstone from surrounding villages was used. In the Reformation, the inhabitants of Meddersheim became Protestant under the then local lordship. During renovations at Saint Martin's Evangelical church in 1964, the Baroque screen around the altar was removed. For generations, the church was shared. During Catholic Mass, the gate was closed. A few epitaphs, a ceiling-high sacramental shrine in the Gothic quire and a Stumm organ, together with a series of pictures on the gallery bear witness to the wealth of this winegrowing, farming and craft village. In 1960, Meddersheim had some 750 inhabitants. By 2010 it was nearly 1,400.History =Jewish history= Meddersheim had a small Jewish community in the 19th century. It arose in the 18th century. The forebears of the Families Feibelmann and Ostermann lived here as early as the latter half of the 18th century. In the 19th century, the number of Jewish inhabitants developed as follows: in 1808, there were 32 Jewish inhabitants in seven families with all together 16 children; in 1855, there were 54; in 1861, the Jewish population peaked at 55. In the latter half of the 19th century, the number shrank owing to migration to the towns and cities, particularly because Meddersheim had no railway link, so that in 1895, only 23 Jewish inhabitants were left. The Family Feibelmann moved to Sobernheim, while a branch of the Family Ostermann moved to Bochum. In the way of institutions, there were a prayer room in one of the Jewish houses and a graveyard. Jewish children, too, likely got their schooling in one of the Jewish houses. One member of Meddersheim's Jewish community fell in the First World War, Arthur Ostermann (b. 16 September 1890 in Meddersheim, d. 8 December 1914). His name can be found on the memorial to the fallen at the Jewish graveyard in Bad Sobernheim. On the warriors‚Äô memorial at Meddersheim's municipal graveyard, he is listed as missing in action. Also lost in the Great War was Gefreiter Richard Feibelmann (b. 26 November 1889 in Meddersheim, d. 21 November 1917), but he had moved to Sobernheim by 1914. About 1924, when there were still 16 members of the local Jewish community, they had by then joined the Jewish community in Sobernheim. Research in the village has drawn different accounts from Meddersheim inhabitants as to just where the former Jewish community's prayer room was. It could be that services were held at various Jewish houses because no room anywhere in the village had been specifically set up for the purpose. Towards the end, services were surely irregular, and perhaps held only on high holidays. In 1933, the year when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power, 12 Jews were still living in Meddersheim. In the years that followed, though, some of the Jews moved away or even emigrated in the face of the boycotting of their businesses, the progressive stripping of their rights and repression, all brought about by the Nazis. The livestock dealer Leo Rauner went to Pittsburgh in 1938, and a few members of the Family Ostermann, too, went to the United States. In April 1942, the last Jews living in the village, the four-headed Family Braun, were deported. According to the Gedenkbuch ‚Äì Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 (‚ÄúMemorial Book ‚Äì Victims of the Persecution of the Jews under National Socialist Tyranny‚Äù) and Yad Vashem, of all Jews who either were born in Meddersheim or lived there for a long time, 7 died in the time of the Third Reich (birthdates in brackets): #Hermine Braun n√©e G√§rtner (1898) #Hildegard Braun (1923) #Norbert Braun (1926) #Siegmund Braun (1862) #Siegmund Braun (1889) #Walter Haas (1904) #Jakob Ostermann (1872)Jewish history Religion As at 30 November 2013, there are 1,344 full-time residents in Meddersheim, and of those, 811 are Evangelical (60.342%), 250 are Catholic (18.601%), 15 (1.116%) belong to other religious groups and 268 (19.94%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"300\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   SPD  CDU  FWG  UWG  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  3  3  5  5  16 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  3  2  7  4  16 seats } =Mayor= Meddersheim's mayor is Renate Weingarth- Schenk, and her deputies are Karl Curt Bamberger, Michael Engisch and G√ºnter Weinel.Meddersheim‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: In Blau auf silbernem Ro√ü, der golden nimbierte, rot gekleidete St. Martin, der mit silbernem Schwert den roten Mantel dem auf der Erde sitzenden Bettler zuteilt; im linken Obereck ein goldenes Schildchen, darin ein roter, blau gekr√∂nter L√∂wenkopf. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Azure on a horse passant argent bridled sable and saddled of the field Saint Martin reguardant with nimbus Or vested gules cutting his mantle with a sword of the second for a beggar man sitting on the ground, in sinister chief an inescutcheon of the fourth charged with a lion's head erased of the fifth crowned of the first. This scene from Saint Martin's life appears in many German civic coats of arms. Indeed, Meddersheim's arms are not even the only ones in the Bad Kreuznach district to bear this image, with Norheim and R√ºdesheim an der Nahe likewise bearing arms depicting Martin cutting off a piece of his cloak for a beggar. In Meddersheim's case, the image goes back to the village's old court seal, which also bore this image. Meddersheim's arms are distinguished, however, by the small inescutcheon in sinister chief (upper left corner to the armsbearer, and thus upper right to the viewer). The charge thereon, a lion's head, is a reference to historical lordships. Meddersheim was an Oberschulthei√üerei in the Waldgraviate- Rhinegraviate. In 1750 it belonged as a condominium to the lines of Salm- Kyrburg and Dhaun, with each holding a one-half share. Salm-Kyrburg bore arms gules three lions Or (a red shield with three gold lions). For heraldic reasons, the lion's head is borne in Meddersheim's arms in reversed tinctures.Description and explanation of Meddersheim‚Äôs arms Description and explanation of Meddersheim‚Äôs arms =Town partnerships= Meddersheim fosters partnerships with the following places: * Nea Kios, Argolis, Peloponnese, Greece ::The partnership agreement between Meddersheim and Nea Kios () was read out by mayors Tilo Krau√ü (Meddersheim) and Georgios Maninis (Nea Kios) and signed amid much festivity on 15 July 2008 in Meddersheim.Partnership with Nea Kios Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Evangelical church, Naheweinstra√üe 32 ‚Äì Romanesque quire tower, spire 1814, Late Gothic quire, about 1500, Late Baroque aisleless church, 1756; gateway arch to the rectory, mid 19th century, churchyard wall, below in the graveyard gravestones, 19th century * Hintergasse 15 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, marked 1805 * Hohlgasse 1 ‚Äì Baroque timber-frame house, plastered, possibly 18th century * Hohlgasse 3 ‚Äì inn; Classicist timber-frame building, plastered and slated, marked 1830 * Kirschrother Stra√üe 6/8 ‚Äì estate complex; pair of semi-detached houses, timber framing plastered, marked 1830; commercial building 19th century * Naheweinstra√üe, graveyard ‚Äì Schlarb gravestone, stele with antique relief, towards 1900 * Naheweinstra√üe 6 ‚Äì Late Historicist villa, marked 1911 * Naheweinstra√üe 21 ‚Äì four-sided estate; Classicist timber-frame house, plastered, about 1830/1840; commercial building, partly timber-frame * Naheweinstra√üe 24 ‚Äì Late Baroque building with hipped mansard roof, timber framing plastered, latter half of the 18th century * Naheweinstra√üe 30 ‚Äì former schoolteacher‚Äôs house; Baroque building with half-hip roof, marked 1737 * Naheweinstra√üe 32/34 ‚Äì Evangelical schoolhouse and rectory; representative building with hip roof, about 1850/1860 * Naheweinstra√üe 36 ‚Äì Baroque timber-frame house, partly solid, marked 1723 * Naheweinstra√üe 46 ‚Äì former Rhinegravial estate; 16th to 19th centuries; two- part complex of buildings made up of timber-frame houses, built-in staircase tower, marked 1592 * At Naheweinstra√üe 49 ‚Äì Classicist door with skylight, marked 1820 * At Neugasse 5 ‚Äì house door, marked 1834 * Sobernheimer Stra√üe 2 ‚Äì inn ‚ÄûZur Traube‚Äú; Baroque building with hipped mansard roof, partly timber- frame, marked 1747 * Sobernheimer Stra√üe 5 ‚Äì Baroque timber-frame house, partly slated, marked 1681 and 1725, alterations in the 19th century * Sobernheimer Stra√üe 16 ‚Äì Altes Rathaus (‚ÄúOld Town Hall‚Äù); partly timber-frame, essentially possibly from about 1600 and from the 17th century, ridge turret with bell, 1719 * Unterm Winkel ‚Äì bridge, two-arched, latter half of the 19th century * Bridge across the Nahe, on Kreisstra√üe 62 ‚Äì five-arched bridge, sandstone-block, about 1860, after demolition with explosives in 1946/1947 reconstructed * Jewish graveyard ‚ÄúAuf dem Judenkirchhof‚Äù (monumental zone)Landkreis Bad Kreuznach: Inhaltsverzeichnis des Kreisrechtes, abgerufen am 31.

The last confirmed burial there was in 1935 (Julius Feibelmann, d. 16 September 1935), although it is also believed that Salomon and Babette Braun, as well as a child born in 1937 to the Family Braun who died quite young (Salomon's and Babette's grandchild), were buried at the graveyard later. After the Second World War, the graveyard was first refurbished and fenced in in 1955 with state funding, because the mayor and municipal council had refused to contribute financially to the project, citing the municipality's empty coffers. In 1973, too, the graveyard was refurbished, with gravestones that had fallen over or been thrown about being set upright again. The graveyard's area is 1 358 m¬≤. Thirty-one graves can still be made out. The gravestones quite likely do not all stand in their original places. The graveyard lies southeast of Meddersheim on the slope of the Dornberg near the so-called M√ºhlenw√§ldchen (‚ÄúLittle Mill Wood‚Äù).Jewish graveyard =Winegrowing= Meddersheim has four wineries (Weing√ºter) and one winemakers‚Äô collective. The Meddersheim winegrowing area belongs to the winemaking appellation ‚Äì Gro√ülage ‚Äì of ‚ÄúParadiesgarten‚Äù. Well known individual winegrowing locations ‚Äì Einzellagen ‚Äì are the ‚ÄúAltenberg‚Äù, the ‚ÄúEdelberg‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRheingrafenberg‚Äù. On roughly 60% of the village's vineyard area, it is the Riesling grape that is grown. Meddersheim's wineries are listed here: *Weingut Bamberger *Weingut Hehner-Kiltz *Weingut Hexamer *Weingut SchlarbWinegrowing Meddersheim belongs to the Nahe wine region. Far beyond the district's limits, Meddersheim is known for its wine festival. The local winemakers offer their wares each year on the last weekend in August at the village square. There the festival begins with the tapping of the Meddersheim wine barrel and the free dispensing of the contents by the incumbent mayor. As well, the local clubs supply the guests with alcohol-free drinks and food. This festival draws hundreds to the village each year. =Unser Dorf hat Zukunft= Vying in 2012 in the contest Unser Dorf hat Zukunft (‚ÄúOur village has a future‚Äù) at the state level were 269 municipalities.

Keckler; and commissioned on 28 August 1944 with Lieutenant Eli T. Ringler, USCG, in command. Service history =World War II, 1944-1946= During World War II, LST-786 was assigned to the Asiatic- Pacific theater and participated in the assault and occupation of Iwo Jima from 12 to 28 February 1945, and the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto in May and June 1945. Following the war, she performed occupation duty in the Far East and saw service in China until mid-December 1945. LST-786 was decommissioned on 9 July 1946 at Astoria, Oregon and assigned to the Columbia River Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 1 July 1955 the ship was redesignated USS Garrett County (LST-786). =Vietnam War, 1966-1971= Recommissioned on 15 October 1966 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard with Lieutenant James C. Kunz USN in command. Garrett County saw extensive service during the Vietnam War, operating as part of Operation Game Warden, a brown- water navy effort to keep the rivers free of Viet Cong infiltration. Four LST were recommissioned to support river patrol operations with the intent of keeping three ships on-station at any one time supporting a River Division of 10 Patrol Boat River, a Detachment of 2 UH-1 Helicopter Gunships and a SEAL Platoon. The ship not on-station was undergoing ship repairs in the Western Pacific. Garrett County reported on-station to CTF 116 on 12 March 1967 and operated as a Patrol Craft Tender (AGP) for the next 48 months on the rivers of the Mekong Delta.CWO3 John Trolinger, Instructor/Boat Captain/Patrol Leader The ship participated in the following campaigns: Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase III (29 November 1967 to 29 January 1968); Tet Counteroffensive (30 January to 1 April 1968); Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase IV (2 April to 30 June 1968); Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase V (1 July to 1 November 1968); Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VI (2 November to 2 December 1968 and 23 January 1969); Tet/69 Counteroffensive (28 February to 8 June 1969); Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969 (9 June to 11 August 1969, 7 September 1969, and 31 December 1969 to 21 February 1970); and Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VII (1 September 1970, 5 to 30 November 1970, and 31 December 1970 to 2 February 1971). LST-786 earned one battle star for World War II service, and two Presidential Unit Citation, two Navy Unit Commendation, and eight battle stars for the Vietnam War. =Republic of Vietnam and Philippine Navy= Decommissioned and transferred to South Vietnam for service in the Republic of Vietnam Navy on 23 April 1971, she was renamed RVNS Can Tho (HQ-801). The ship and her crew escaped to the Philippines during the fall of the South Vietnamese government, after which custody was transferred to the Republic of the Philippines. She was renamed BRP Kalinga Apayao (LT-516) for service in the Philippine Navy. She was decommissioned in September 2010 and was reportedly scrapped at Naval Base Cavite in 2012.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bad Kreuznach, whose seat is in the like-named town, although this lies outside the Verbandsgemeinde. Pfaffen-Schwabenheim is a winegrowing village. Geography =Location= Pfaffen-Schwabenheim lies on the Appelbach in the district's easternmost corner, just east of the district seat of Bad Kreuznach (and thus east of the Nahe) and 14 km directly south of the Rhine at Bingen's outlying centre of Kempten. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim's neighbours are the municipalities of Biebelsheim, Zotzenheim, Sprendlingen, Badenheim, Pleitersheim and Volxheim and the town of Bad Kreuznach. Zotzenheim, Sprendlingen and Badenheim all lie in the neighbouring Mainz-Bingen district, whereas all the others likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Pfaffen-Schwabenheim is the outlying homestead of Schleifm√ºhle.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 14 (PDF; 2,3 MB) History During some clearing work not very many years ago, workers happened upon some roof tiles and ceramic shards. Dr. Rupprecht from the directorate of the Kulturelles Erbe (‚ÄúCultural Heritage‚Äù) in Mainz, recognized at first glance the typical piece scored with a metal comb, a technique employed to give opus caementicium a stronger grip. The shards, too, could quickly be classified as roofing from a Roman villa rustica. It is believed that there is much more in the way of remnants hidden in the earth, and there is to be a dig at the villa someday. In many writings about Pfaffen-Schwabenheim, the year 765 is given as the date of the village's first documentary mention. Invoked here is a document issued by Count Cancro as endower of a vineyard for Lorsch Abbey. The municipality also used it to justify holding their 1,200th anniversary in 1965. Whether this vineyard actually lay within Pfaffen-Schwabenheim's limits, though, is by no means certain. The document in question only names a place called Suaboheim im Wormsgau, which could just as easily mean Schwabenheim an der Selz. There being two places with the same name in the same region, it is of course impossible to make a clear determination in favour of either place, even though the name crops up in four further donation documents from the abbey from the 8th century. Because there were so many donations in the neighbouring municipalities to the abbey in the same time period, and because Suaboheim was mentioned in documents so many times, it is at least likely, though, that one document or another actually refers to Pfaffen-Schwabenheim. However, the first certain mention came in 1130. Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz (d. 1137) then documented that Count Meginhard of Sponheim ‚Äúin villa que vocatur Suaboheim‚Äù (‚Äúin the village that is called Schwabenheim‚Äù) had transferred the abbey to Archiepiscopal ownership for it to be occupied by Augustinian canons. The abbey itself had been founded about 1040, with Eberhard VI of Nellenburg as one of its cofounders. It is from this document that something first comes to light about the abbey with whose fate the village's is so tightly bound. Among other things, the village has the abbey to thank for the inclusion of the element ‚ÄúPfaffen-‚Äù in its name (Pfaffe is an old German word for ‚Äúpriest‚Äù, nowadays considered somewhat derogatory; it thus roughly corresponds with the English ‚Äúparson‚Äù; the form with the ‚Äîn suffix is genitive, making the name's meaning ‚ÄúParson‚Äôs Schwabenheim‚Äù). The ‚ÄúPfaffen-‚Äù tag first cropped up in a 1248 document, and it has served to distinguish Pfaffen-Schwabenheim from the otherwise like-named village on the River Selz, already mentioned above. The reason for this choice of a tag, of course, was the Augustinian canons themselves. The name ‚ÄúSchwabenheim‚Äù itself might go back to Alemannic settlers. This tribe's original homeland was Swabia (called Schwaben in German), but they eventually spread to what is now Rhenish Hesse. It is possible, if not altogether likely, that the composition of the name is typical of that seen in Frankish villages‚Äô names. According to that point of view, the name could be interpreted as ‚ÄúSuabo‚Äôs Home‚Äù. Whatever might actually be so, there is no doubt that the decisive impetus for founding the village can be traced to the Frankish taking of the land. Even today, the church with the adjoining mighty convent buildings characterizes Pfaffen-Schwabenheim's appearance. The buildings that stand now, however, date only from the abbey's last phase in the mid 18th century. Only the church's chancel, which as an Early Gothic work is of interest to architectural historians, is older. It cannot be reliably determined when building work on this quire began, but it is highly likely that this happened in the earlier half of the 13th century. The abbey and its monks strongly characterized the village's past. The Pfaffen-Schwabenheim villagers were wholly subject to the provost: they had to do unfree labour, such as working three days to bring in the fruit and vegetable harvest for the lord or helping with the vineyard harvest for one day, among other services that were required. The greater part of Pfaffen- Schwabenheim's municipal area belonged to the abbey, although right from the beginning, there must have been others with landholds here, for according to the Pfaffen-Schwabenheim Weistum (cognate with English wisdom, this was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), a self-administering municipality existed alongside the provost's estate. About 1120, the village passed as a dowry for the Nellenburg heiress Mechtild of M√∂rsberg to the County of Sponheim. After the Sponheims split their county into two entities in 1220, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim became part of the County of Sponheim-Kreuznach, which ‚Äì at least because when viewed from Mainz it seemed this way ‚Äì was also known as the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim. From the time when the abbey was transferred to Archiepiscopal ownership in 1130, the abbey Vogtei was held by the Counts of Sponheim. After the Sponheim- Kreuznach line of counts died out in 1414, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim passed to the Counts of Sponheim-Starkenburg. When that line then died out only 23 years later in 1437, their joint successors were Electoral Palatinate, the Margraviate of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz-Zweibr√ºcken. This last lordship succeeded in 1444 upon the last count's death to the House of Palatinate- Simmern, who also inherited the rank of Elector in 1559 and eventually died out in 1685. The monastery experienced an upswing in the 15th and 16th centuries. The abbey's heyday in the time when it was subject to the Congregation of Windesheim (named after a place of that name near Zwolle in the Netherlands where this branch of the Augustinians established its first monastery) lasted almost one hundred years and ended with the 16th century's religious wars. In 1566, the Sponheims‚Äô heirs decided to forsake the monastery. After the devastating Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession) ended in 1697, the new Electoral line of Palatinate-Neuburg, in the course of its policy of Recatholicization, had a Baroque monastery complex built in Pfaffen- Schwabenheim, which is today the biggest such complex that has been preserved unaltered in Rhineland-Palatinate. This same year, the Augustinian canons under Prior Ignaz Antonius Martels came back to the abbey. Under the prior's leadership, the monastery experienced another upswing. After the partition of the condominium between Baden and Electoral Palatinate in 1707, Pfaffen- Schwabenheim belonged wholly, as part of the Oberamt of Kreuznach, to the latter of those states. The incorporation of the village into the French state in 1797/1798 put an end to centuries-old ruling structures. Pfaffen- Schwabenheim found itself in the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). In the course of Secularization, the abbey was dissolved in 1802. The abbey's wealth of holdings was declared ‚Äúnational property‚Äù by the French and was auctioned off. Pfaffen-Schwabenheim was then a small place. In 1815, at the time of the Congress of Vienna, the village had 404 inhabitants. In the course of general development, the figure had risen to almost one and a half times that by 1846, to 601; by 1905 there were 660 inhabitants. In 1870, several villagers from Pfaffen-Schwabenheim took part in the campaign against France (in the Franco-Prussian War), and one did not come back. The fallen soldiers‚Äô names can be found on a plaque at the warriors‚Äô memorial in the village centre. Modernity began to arrive in Pfaffen-Schwabenheim with the onset of the 20th century. In 1903, the water supply was ensured with the laying of a watermain, and in 1912, electricity came to Pfaffen-Schwabenheim. Not long thereafter, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim was linked to the Bad Kreuznach tramway, which ran from the spa town by way of Bosenheim (now amalgamated with Bad Kreuznach) to Pfaffen-Schwabenheim, and thence onwards to Sprendlingen and Sankt Johann. Service ended in 1952. The warriors‚Äô memorial at the municipal graveyard memorializes the fallen from both world wars. Twenty-two soldiers from Pfaffen-Schwabenheim fell in the First World War, while 53 fell in the Second World War. On 17 March 1945, the Americans were advancing on the village, laying down artillery fire while fighter pilots bombed it. Some houses sustained damage, and two villagers were killed. In the 1960s and 1970s, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim, along with other municipalities near the district seat, profited from its real estate potential, which drew many people from nearby Bad Kreuznach to the village who built houses and settled. Beginning in 1955, when 774 people lived in Pfaffen-Schwabenheim, the municipality was able to increase its population steadily. In the early 1980s, it had reached 915, and by 2011 this had risen to 1,350. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim was grouped along with eight other municipalities into the Verbandsgemeinde of Bad Kreuznach.History History =Augustinian Canonical Foundation‚Äôs history= The monastic foundation was founded about 1040 by Blessed Eberhard VI of Nellenburg and his mother Hedwig. About 1124, it passed as a dowry for the Nellenburg heiress Hedwig von M√∂rsberg to the County of Sponheim. In 1130 it was transferred under the terms of the Concordat of Worms to the Archbishop of Mainz, who had it occupied by Augustinian canons. The Schirmvogtei (roughly ‚Äúprotectorate‚Äù) was exercised by the line of the Counts of Sponheim who owned Castle Dill at Dill, a village in the Hunsr√ºck. In 1468, the monastery was joined with the Congregation of Windesheim (named after a place of that name near Zwolle in the Netherlands where this branch of the Augustinians established its first monastery). In the course of the Reformation, the abbey was dissolved in 1566, but it was revived in 1697 in the course of Palatinate- Neuburg‚Äôs Recatholicization policy and occupied by Augustinian canons from Klausen. Beginning in 1699 under Provost Anton Ignaz von Martels (b. 1669 at Schloss Dankern in Haren; d. 1740 in Pfaffen-Schwabenheim), all the monastery‚Äôs former real estate was let to the Electoral Palatinate ecclesiastical landhold administration, and a lively flurry of building activity ensued. The Augustinian canons also provided pastoral care to the neighbouring villages of Badenheim, Ober-Hilbersheim, Sprendlingen, Welgesheim and Zotzenheim. In 1802, the monastery was dissolved in the course of Secularization under Napoleon. At the same time, the pilgrimage to Mary Queen of Peace, which had begun in the mid 18th century, came to an end. In 1808, in the second round of reorganization of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz after the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the church passed as a chapel of ease to the parish of Badenheim. With the bull of circumscription, Provida solersque, of 16 August 1821, Pope Pius VII ordered the permanent dissolution of the monastery. Indeed, by 1811, a seniors‚Äô home for retired priests had already been set up in what had been the provostry buildings, and this lasted until 1826. In 1832, the monastery, having by now long stood empty, was, with the exception of the church and the north wing, sold to the municipality, which established a school in the east end of the south wing. In 1833, the whole east and west wings as well as the remaining parts of the south wing were sold again, this time to private owners. In 1972, the pilgrimage to Mary Queen of Peace was revived. Beginning in 1980, the provostry buildings were restored by their private owners. In 2001, there was an extensive restoration to the Baroque part of the monastery church, while in 2013 and 2014, extensive conservational measures were being undertaken on the fa√ßade of the Late Romanesque east quire, as were wood preservation measures on the wooden Baroque furnishings.

In der oberen H√§lfte in Silber die Halbfigur eines Augustiner-M√∂nches in Vorderansicht, beiderseitig begleitet von einem gr√ºnen Weinstock. Die untere H√§lfte ist in Blau und Gold geschachtet. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent issuant from the line of partition an Augustinian monk affronty between two grapevines likewise issuant vert, and chequy azure and Or. The German blazon does not mention the trellises on which the grapevines grow, nor the book that the monk is holding. Indeed, the coat of arms shown at Pfaffen- Schwabenheim's own website shows both in different tinctures to what is seen in this article (the trellises are brown instead of green, and the book is red instead of silver), while the grapevines themselves have leaves. The monk is also shown there with a beard. The civic arms in this form created by the artist were approved by the Rhineland-Palatinate Ministry of the Interior by a document issued on 10 June 1953. Pfaffen-Schwabenheim belonged in the Middle Ages to the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim, and passed upon its ruling house's extinction in 1473 to joint Electoral Palatinate and Badish rule. From 1707 until the late 18th century, the former was the only overlord. The blue and gold ‚Äúchequy‚Äù pattern in the lower field was passed down with the mark ‚ÄúP‚ÄìS‚Äù (for ‚ÄúPfaffen-Schwabenheim‚Äù) by a court seal from the 17th century (some original stamps from the seal are at the Darmstadt State Archive, while some gypsum stamps can be found at the Mainz State Archive). The upper field is a modern creation, and is canting (see the explanation of the name element ‚ÄúPfaffen-‚Äù under History, above). The whole symbolizes the most important forces that defined the village's history: the Counts of Sponheim and the Augustinian monks, who through their local monastic foundation became indigenous fosterers of culture and at the same time the main promoters of the village's ancient art of winegrowing. The tinctures of the Sponheim arms are confirmed (and indeed are well known). The tinctures that appear in the upper field follow established heraldic norms. The Augustinians wore black habits.Description and explanation of Pfaffen-Schwabenheim‚Äôs arms =Town partnerships= Pfaffen-Schwabenheim fosters partnerships with the following places: * Sp√∂ren, Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Saxony-Anhalt since 1991 ::Sp√∂ren, together with its outlying centre of Prussendorf, is a Stadtteil of the town of Z√∂rbig. This came about on 1 March 2004 when Sp√∂ren was amalgamated along with L√∂beritz, G√∂ttnitz, Salzfurtkapelle, Schrenz and Stumsdorf into Z√∂rbig.

The former provostry church (then known as the monastery or abbey church, now as the Catholic Parish Church of the Assumption of Mary, or Pfarrkirche Mari√§ Himmelfahrt in German) that was built into the Baroque complex is one of Rhineland-Palatinate's noteworthiest Late Romanesque churches, and it stands under the protection of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Since August 2012 the church has also been a promotional project of the Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz (German Foundation for Monument Protection). The abbey church itself unites Lower-Rhine and Upper-Rhine Romanesque with elements of the Gothic that came from France into a unique, harmonious ambiance. The church is made up of two parts that date from different times: the Late Romanesque quire and the Late Baroque nave. The Late Romanesque tapering quire is enclosed by an apse flanked by round towers and was built sometime in the years from 1230 to 1248. The transept, completed in 1260, has now vanished. In 1308 came the final consecration, whose 700th anniversary in 2008 was celebrated with a Pontifical High Mass with Karl Cardinal Lehmann. The Late Baroque aisleless nave was built onto the Late Romanesque quire in 1766, and in 1848 it was given a ridge turret. The convent buildings that were built between 1723 and 1764 form a three-winged Baroque complex with mansard roofs and elaborate stucco ceilings of the Mainz school of strapwork. The highlight among the stucco ceilings is the painted one in the former refectory measuring more than 90 m¬≤, which bears inscribed witness to the sponsor of these works, Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine. The last remnants of the ringwall that once girded the monastery were removed in 2003 when a new building zone was laid out. =Clubs= The following clubs are active in Pfaffen-Schwabenheim: *Evangelischer Kirchenchor ‚Äî Evangelical church choir *F√∂rdergemeinschaft Kirchen, Klosteranlagen und Kulturdenkm√§ler Pfaffen-Schwabenheim e.V. ‚Äî promotional association for churches, monastery complexes and cultural monuments *Gewerbeverein ‚Äî business association *Jugendf√∂rderverein ‚Äî youth promotional association *‚ÄúKlosterb√ºhne‚Äù Pfaffen- Schwabenheim e.V. ‚Äî amateur theatrical group *Kulturverein Pfaffen- Schwabenheim e.V. ‚Äî cultural club *Landfrauenverein ‚Äî countrywomen's club *Reit- und Fahrsportverein Pfaffen-Schwabenheim ‚Äî driving and riding club *Sozialverband VdK Rheinland Pfalz e.V.

Businesses plying other crafts, and some in the service sector, too, are located on 17 ha of land set aside for commercial use, offering local jobs. An advantage to local businesses is the favourable road links.Economic structure =Winegrowing= Pfaffen-Schwabenheim belongs to the ‚ÄúBingen Winegrowing Area‚Äù within the Rheinhessen wine region. Sixteen winegrowing businesses are active in the village, and the area currently given over to vineyards is 160 ha. Roughly 80% of the grapes are white wine varieties (as at 2007). In 1979, there were still 56 such businesses, and the area then given over to vineyards was slightly less at 141 ha.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz - Infothek Among Pfaffen-Schwabenheim's other Weing√ºter (wineries) are these:Wineries *Weinbau C.u.K.

Less than 2 km along Landesstra√üe 413 northeast of the village are interchanges with both Bundesstra√üe 50 and the Autobahn A 61 (Koblenz‚ÄìLudwigshafen). Serving neighbouring Sprendlingen is a railway station on the Rheinhessenbahn. Another serves neighbouring Bad Kreuznach with a variety of rail services. The Kreuznacher Stra√üen- und Vorortbahnen (\\"Kreuznach Tramways and Suburban Railways\\") ran a tramway from Bad Kreuznach to Pfaffen-Schwabenheim and beyond until it was closed in 1952. =Education= Pfaffen-Schwabenheim has a daycare centre with spaces for 75 children aged from 2 to 6 years, split into three mixed-age groups tended by a staff of nine. The children here are mainly from Pfaffen-Schwabenheim and neighbouring Pleitersheim. The Grundschule Pfaffen-Schwabenheim (primary school) is attended by 145 schoolchildren from Pfaffen-Schwabenheim, Badenheim, Pleitersheim, Volxheim and Biebelsheim. =Public institutions= Pfaffen-Schwabenheim has a village community centre with seating for up to 300, a public address system, a fully equipped kitchen, a stage and parking.

Longtime childhood friend and colleague, Attorney Reid Kahn, remembers Falk proclaiming that he wanted to represent professional athletes in the fourth grade. Another high school friend noted that Falk was not good enough to make any of the teams at Douglas MacArthur High School (Levittown, New York), but that he was an ardent sports fan who frequently watched baseball games at Shea Stadium. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1972, with a degree in economics, and subsequently, George Washington University Law School, where he earned a J.D. with honors in 1975. During his law school years, his parents separated. Falk maintained minimal contact with his father, but remained very close with his mother until her death in 1988.

Dell was a former pro tennis player and primarily represented tennis players, so he allowed Falk to handle a large portion of ProServ's NBA dealings. Falk proved to be a capable agent and negotiator, as he signed the #1 NBA Draft picks in 1976 (John Lucas) and 1981 (Mark Aguirre),Hobgood, C. \\"Floating on air: David Falk\\", Washington Business Journal, March 8, 2002, available online at bizjournals.com.

ProServ had an inside track with North Carolina after they successfully represented a number of N.C. basketball alumni, including Tom LaGarde, Phil Ford, Dudley Bradley, and James Worthy. In 1984, the same year Michael Jordan entered the NBA Draft, Frank Craighill and Lee Fentress, two of Dell's ProServ partners, left to start a competing firm, Advantage International. Dell and Falk signed #3 pick Jordan, while Craighill and Fentress signed Sam Perkins. = Nike shoe deal: \\"Air Jordan\\" = After signing Jordan, Falk quickly made the first great deal for him: the Nike shoe deal. At the start of the 80s, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had a six-figure shoe deal for $100,000 (with Adidas), and Nike was a small player next to companies like Converse, which had virtually owned the market on basketball shoes through the 1970s. After James Worthy signed an 8-year, $1.2 million endorsement deal with New Balance in 1982, also negotiated by Falk, Falk decided to make large demands to shoe companies for Jordan's services, including his own shoe line and a royalty.Ken Clark. \\"The art of the sneaker deal\\", Footwear News, April 21, 1997, available online at highbeam.com. Retrieved August 19, 2007. > We decided to stretch the envelope\\", Falk said. \\"Instead of calling up the > companies and asking them how much they would pay Michael Jordan, we called > them up and asked them to make a presentation and explain what they could do > to promote him. Needless to say, this got a lot of quizzical replies.\\" Unbeknownst to Falk and Jordan, Nike had decided to target Jordan as their player of the future. Jordan himself was initially reticent; throughout college he had worn Converse because of the company's endorsement deal with Tar Heels coach Dean Smith, and off the court, he wore Adidas.Dan Wetzel, Don Yaeger (2000). Sole Influence. New York: Warner Books. Jordan had never worn or even seen a Nike shoe before the company contacted him. Nike's initial offer was $250,000, his own shoe line, and a percentage of the revenues. Jordan already had a standing offer from Adidas for $500,000, and Falk demanded that Nike match the figure in addition to the revenue percentage. Nike came back with an offer of $500,000 and a smaller cut. Falk agreed. > \\"David Falk elected to take more guaranteed money and less revenue > percentage\\", said (Nike Scout) Sonny Vaccaro. \\"So out of the chute he lost > himself a lot of money. But in retrospect, it really amounted to nothing. It > wasn't a big-time bidding war. Probably the most determining thing was > Adidas wasn't going to offer him a lot of money. It was the first time that > the athlete was going to share in the royalties of the shoe. That was the > gamble.\\" The deal was all the more significant because it was considered difficult to market African-American players in 1984, especially in a team sport like basketball. In fact, Nike insisted on several \\"outs\\" in its initial contract with Jordan: the shoe line could be dropped if certain sales figures were not met, or if Jordan failed to make the NBA All-Star Game in his first three years. The shoe line was expected to earn $3 million for Nike in about three to four years. As it turned out, the Air Jordan sneaker earned Nike $130 million in 1985 alone, making their $500,000 contract with Jordan one of the great bargains of all time, a precursor to Jordan's more lucrative deals with Nike, including a 1997 deal for $30 million. Jordan's relationship with Nike is often considered the most successful sports endorsement relationship in history. = Marketing Michael Jordan = Falk soon proved himself to be a capable agent with many innovative marketing ideas. He allowed Nike to establish Jordan's primary image, then began splitting it up among other advertisers, including Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Wilson Sporting Goods, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.Marantz, S. \\"The power of air\\", The Sporting News, December 22, 1997, available online at encyclopedia.com. Retrieved June 22, 2007. Falk's ideas stretched to all areas of the marketplace, including a fragrance (called simply \\"Michael Jordan\\") made by the Beverly Hills designer Bijan, which was cited as the best-marketed product of 1996 by the American Marketing Association. Falk even came up with the idea of teaming Bugs Bunny and Jordan together in a feature film, and then sold the concept to Warner Bros. in 1993. The ensuing film, Space Jam, was executive produced by Falk and released in 1996. Perhaps most importantly, Falk \\"set a precedent by 'opting out' Jordan from the league's licensing program, in effect reclaiming Jordan's image for his own use.\\" Jordan himself was very grateful for his agent's remarkable negotiating and marketing abilities, even with Falk's penchant for making powerful enemies along the way. > A lot of people don't like David, but he's the best at what he does\\", Jordan > told USA Today last year. \\"What he does is get underneath your skin, whoever > he's negotiating with, because he figures out what your objectives are, your > angles.

He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan.'\\" Due partly to Falk's tenacity and partly to Michael Jordan's own professional success and personal magnetism, Jordan became \\"indisputably the most powerful and effective endorser of products in American history, ... (making) the business of hawking products more lucrative than playing the game.\\" Jordan's success was such that he turned down $300 million worth of endorsement deals in the space of 4 months in 1998. = ProServ split, establishment and sale of FAME = In 1992, after great early success, Falk considered himself underpaid and underappreciated. He split with ProServ and Donald Dell to establish his own company, Falk Associates Management Enterprises (FAME). > I paid more in taxes this year (1996) than I earned in 17 years working for > Donald Dell\\", Falk said with some lingering bitterness. \\"I'm all for > loyalty, but that has to be a two-way street.\\" In the split, a messy professional divorce, Falk brought all of his considerable client list with him, but agreed to provide Dell with 50% of fees for Dell's former clients and 17.5% of Falk's income for new contracts. Dell \\"sought arbitration to enforce the agreement, claiming that Falk 'unilaterally' had rewritten clients' third-party contracts to reduce fees to Dell.\\" Falk and partners Curtis Polk and Mike Higgins soon propelled FAME to the top of the NBA player representation business.

The lockout originally occurred when the players wanted a soft salary cap, while the owners wanted a hard salary cap. Falk led a rebellion on the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) by establishing a dissident faction of 16 players and a number of agents (including players Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, Reggie Miller, and fellow agents Marc Fleisher and Arn Tellem) that began advocating for NBPA decertification.Powell, S.\\"Players and owners can't make headway on a cap\\" , The Sporting News, August 14, 1995, available online at findarticles.com.

The goal was to strip NBA management of antitrust protection, making the salary cap and other forms of collective bargaining violations of antitrust laws, win a settlement in court, and then immediately re-form the Players' Union. NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Falk's involvement in the negotiations, saying that he was \\"trashing his own clients.\\" Kenny Gattison, the Charlotte Hornets' player representative, went so far as to blame the entire lockout on Falk. > I think this whole thing has been manufactured by David Falk\\", Gattison told > The Charlotte Observer Friday night. \\"The guys he used to initiate the > decertification drive aren't concerned with the union and the everyday > little guy.

Meanwhile, Falk was being criticized on multiple fronts for his role in lockout negotiations. NBA Commissioner David Stern accused Falk and Arn Tellem specifically of \\"holding the deal hostage\\" to reap benefits for their high-end clients.

Falk's long list of star clients made him one of the most powerful people in the NBA. A 1999 deal in which Falk forced the Minnesota Timberwolves to trade Stephon Marbury gives a good indication of how Falk used his power. Falk threatened the Timberwolves by telling them that Marbury would walk away in free agency at the end of the season if he was not traded,Gardner, K. \\"David Falk Still Wields a Strong Hand\\", March 1999. Retrieved June 16, 2007. as well as suggesting that he would dump his stable of free agents into the lap of Chicago Bulls GM Jerry Krause if Marbury was not moved. As the Minnesota Timberwolves started looking around for possible trade scenarios, Falk even went so far as to veto a trade that would have brought Kerry Kittles (another Falk client) to Minnesota for Marbury, claiming that Kittles had no interest in playing for Minnesota.Enlund, T. \\"Deal was taxing for Weinhauer\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 14, 1999, available online at findarticles.com.

A second trade which resulted from Falk's influence was the 2000 mega-deal which moved Knicks All-Star center Patrick Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics in a four-team trade involving 12 players and 5 draft picks. Falk apparently made threats to the Knicks that he would move Glen Rice to the Miami Heat if they did not consent to trade Ewing, who supposedly wanted out of New York. Falk was frequently blasted for making use of threats and side-deals to move his clients around and maximize their earnings, but he remained unapologetic, arguing that he was simply looking after the best interests of his clients. > That's called leverage\\", he said. \\"Every company in the world uses leverage > whenever they engage in any negotiation.

By the end of the 1995 NBA lockout, Falk controlled enough top players that he was seen as \\"dictat(ing) the structure and the economics of the entire league,\\" so much so that during one six-day period in the summer of 1996, he negotiated six contracts‚Äîfor Jordan, Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, Kenny Anderson, Dikembe Mutombo and Lee Mayberry‚Äîworth more than $335 million.

He was so successful at negotiating contracts that in 1998, just before he sold FAME to SFX Entertainment, the contracts of Falk's players totaled just under $800 million. Falk also earned as much as 20% of player endorsement deals and off- court income, and with Michael Jordan's endorsement deals alone soaring to over $40 million annually in the mid-90s, Falk counted his yearly income in the tens of millions. He also negotiated notable shoe endorsements for James Worthy, Boomer Esiason (the first NFL player to endorse the Reebok Pump) and Allen Iverson. Falk was not well-liked around the league, with even NBA executives acknowledging that they felt he held a disproportionate amount of power. As the negotiator behind four of the five largest contracts in team sports history and the pre-eminent agent in the NBA, Falk was a contributor to the spike in player salaries that saw the average NBA contract rise from $330,000 in 1984, the year Jordan was signed, to $4.5 million in 2001, when he stepped down as Chairman of SFX Sports Group.Ford, C. \\"Salary cap for 2006‚Äì07 season set at $53.135 million\\", ESPN.com, July 11, 2006.

The premise behind the show is that deserving individuals are taken to unfamiliar and extreme environments and given the opportunity to participate in an adventure beyond their wildest dreams. Participants are typically seeking a life-changing experience: a boost to improve their health, build their confidence, mend relationships or overcome past difficulties. For each programme four different teams are selected by a small panel comprising adventurers and a psychologist as well as Ben Fogle himself. Each team then travels with Ben to a different region of the world to undertake a challenging trek. First series (2006) Extreme Dreams aired on BBC2 at 6.30pm from 18 September 2006. Teams were chosen to travel to: *Peru (episodes 1-5), to complete a trekking expedition to Choquequirao *Guyana (episodes 6-10), to trek through the jungle to the Kaieteur Falls *Tanzania (episodes 11-15), to climb Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m), the highest peak in Africa *Spitsbergen (episodes 16-20), a Norwegian island in the Arctic Ocean, to trek across glaciers to Temple Mountain The Guyana trip was organised for Ricochet by Trekforce, an expedition company that was able to assist with planning, logistics and safety before and during the trek. The brief was for \\"a jungle destination that was remote, rarely visited and difficult to get to\\" but allowed the camera crews and production team to go about their everyday duties and did not compromise on safety issues.Trekforce website Second series (2008) Series Two aired on BBC2 at 6.30pm from 14 January 2008. The teams of five participants for the second series were chosen by Ben Fogle in February 2007 in Wales, with input from explorer Benedict Allen, wildlife presenter Charlotte Uhlenbroek and psychologist Dr Cynthia McVey. The teams travelled to, respectively: *Nepal, to trek to the sacred lakes of Panch Pokhari in Langtang National Park (one participant evacuated, four successful) *Uganda, to climb the 4844m Mount Baker (two evacuated, three successful) *Libya, to cross a section of the Sahara and reach the ancient city of Ghat (one denied a visa, one evacuated, three successful) *Papua New Guinea, to cross the jungle to Salamoa Beach in Morobe Province on the east coast (all five successful) Subsequently one member of each team was chosen to join Ben in pursuit of his own extreme dream, an ascent of Mount Roraima in Venezuela, location of Arthur Conan Doyle's adventure novel The Lost World which Ben cites as a childhood favourite. All four participants made it to the summit with Ben. Third series (2009) Fogle and his teams completed these expeditions in 2008, and Series Three aired on BBC2 at 6.30pm from 12 January 2009. *Ecuador, to the volcanic Mount Chimborazo (none successful, one evacuated) *Peru, to the Petroglyphs of Pusharo (four successful, one evacuated) *Peru, to the Cotahuasi Canyon in search of the Incan city of Marpa *Chile, across the Atacama Desert to Volcano Corona Criticism Extreme Dreams has received criticism in online forums for the apparently heightened drama of sometimes minor challenges, where everything that happens has to be perceived as \\"extreme\\". Critics have suggested that excessively dramatic presenting and selective editing are used to overemphasise the level of danger and difficulty. Evidence cited includes fictitious sandstorms where the adventurers' clothing is not blowing in the wind; fears of death being imminent and evacuation impossible when the footage is clearly filmed from a moving vehicle; a trek down a hillside on a clearly defined path, described as a dangerous trek through uncharted territory; small tumbles on the trail recalled as nearly fatal; and a misleading depiction of the level of isolation of the group. An episode in the third series claimed that a participant had run a marathon with a foot fracture that had not healed. Conversely, the programme has also attracted criticism for apparently placing fragile or unfit individuals in real danger. Trekforce indicates on its website that the teams were safe and well at all times during the Guyana and Papua New Guinea expeditions. In a similar vein EWP clearly state the Libya Sahara trek involved a standard tourist programme although an abseil down a cliff was thrown in for extra drama.

Pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile. The goal of restoring illuminated manuscripts should be to make them resilient to damage while altering them as little as possible. Each individual manuscript, and even each individual page, must be considered as a separate object with different aspects that must be taken into consideration. This in turn will help determine the best course of preservation or conservation treatment. One of the best ways to become familiar with the variety of issues caused by various materials is to learn about how such manuscripts were made in the past and how they were subsequently treated in later years.Turner, Nancy. \\"The Conservation of Medieval Manuscript Illuminations and the Question of Compensation.\\" WAAC Newsletter 16(1), January 1994: 21‚Äì22.

Chemistry World. rsc.org Areas colored by pigments usually have multiple layers of pigments and other mediums. The most important aspect of preserving pigments and inks is to identify their composition. Some techniques are not suitable for certain pigments and will do further harm.Common Medieval Pigments. .

Descriptions may be wrong or misleading and choosing the wrong treatment may cause irreversible damage.Brown, Michelle P. \\"Pigments and their Uses in Insular Manuscripts\\", in: Roger Powell: The Compleat Binder; edited by John L. Sharpe. (Bibliologia; 14: Elementa ad librorum studia pertenentia), 1996, pp. 136‚Äì45 . There are two different ways to identify pigments: invasive and non-invasive. ;Invasive These tests alter the manuscript in some way, usually by removing some pigment to test a sample. They are generally reliable but results are not always clear. ;Non-Invasive These tests do not alter the manuscript and are much better for conservation purposes than the invasive methods of identification. Some methods include: *Microscopes *Observation under UV, IR, and visible light *X-ray fluorescence (XRF) *Particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE-Œ±) *Raman spectroscopy ;Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy analyzes the molecular vibrations of the pigments and uses this data to map out its chemical makeup. This works on the notion that every substance interacts with radiation in different ways, and these differing ways if measured can help identify the substance without having to take a sample. Unlike other non-invasive identification techniques the results of Raman spectroscopy are much more certain. It is even possible to analyze a pigment beneath a glaze or other treatment. Properties of parchment Parchment is hygroscopic. As such, environmental conditions such as humidity must be kept under control. Pigments add another layer to the problem, forcing a preservationist to fit environmental conditions to two different (and possibly conflicting) sets of ideal limits. Problems can occur when parchment is exposed to high humidity for a long period of time. For example, collagen in the pages could dissolve and stick together.Mowery, J. Franklin. \\"The Conservation of a Thirteenth Century Armenian Manuscript.\\" The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL 10, 1991. These problems are further compounded by the fact that pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile. Pressing an illuminated manuscript pushes the pigment down, altering the image itself and likely causing damage (such as a relief effect to the other side of the page) so it is very important to not put any pressure upon images on parchment, especially when it is wet. This fact also has to be taken into account when cleaning dirt from the image and when encapsulating or framing illuminated parchment for an exhibition. There must be enough room between the image and the protective surface (such as Perspex) that the image will not be subject to rubbing if the parchment should expand with rising humidity. Methods of repair =Consolidation= Consolidation is a process that can either strengthen the bond between pigment and parchment or add protection to pigments and other finishes from aqueous treatments. Strengthening the bond between pigments and parchment help prevent the pigments from flaking and pulling away. The challenge comes with achieving the best consolidation results while altering the object as little as possible.Maheux, Anne F., and Wanda McWilliams. \\"The Use of the Ultrasonic Mister for the Consolidation of a Flaking Gouache Painting on Paper. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Book and Paper Group ANNUAL‚Äô‚Äô 14, 1995. The material used for consolidation should be appropriate for the pigments, the parchment, and any other aspects that may be affected by the application.Quandt, Abigail B. \\"Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.\\" Soluble nylon was used until the mid-1970s when concerns over the material's stability emerged. Parchment size was then favored until the mid-1990s when leaf gelatin gained popularity. This is not to say that gelatin is always the best consolidant to use; no consolidation technique should be used without first considering the pigments and other materials involved, though. For example, gelatin causes white lead to become friable. This problem is compounded by the flexible nature of parchment. One solution to this particular problem is to use some form of a cellulose ether such as methylcellulose, instead of gelatin. Again, this is not necessarily the right choice for every situation. There are a few basic requirements for any consolidation agent: *It has to cause a strong bond to form between the pigment and parchment; *A strong bond also has to be formed between the layers of pigments and any loose particles; *There has to be little alteration of the chemicals, including appearance; *It cannot cause the parchment to lose flexibility. Ultrasonic mister One device recently used in consolidation techniques is the ultrasonic mister. Created in 1991 by Stefan Michalski, this device lends itself well to consolidating materials that react badly with liquids. Gelatin is the preferred consolidant. The ultrasonic mister is usually used in conjunction with a paper suction table to direct the mist at the media and prevent distortion. This is not the best treatment for illuminated manuscripts that have printing on both sides, though. In this case it is better to forgo the suction table and instead use the lowest setting on the mister and to monitor the process carefully. Problems may arise if condensed mist falls onto the parchment from the nozzle so it is advisable that the device be placed on the floor or a similarly low level to coax mist to drain back into the mister instead of falling upon the parchment. =Flattening and crease removal= Traditional methods of removing creases and flattening parchment through humidifying have been detrimental to the state of any pigments, causing them to come off the parchment slightly. This is because the parchment and pigments take on and give off moisture at different rates, causing them to expand and contract at varying rates and thus loosening the pigment from the surface. This results in flaking, cupping, and cracking. =Gore-Tex= The question becomes whether flattening creased parchment to some extent will cause more or less damage to the image than would be caused by not removing the crease. Sometimes not flattening the parchment in some respect will lead to the further degradation of an image. In these cases some form of hydration is necessary. Due to the nature of pigments, though, it is desirable to avoid direct contact with liquid water. This can be accomplished with Gore-Tex. Gore-Tex now has controllable pore size and can block out many liquids, including liquid water and many conservation chemicals. Water vapor can still pass through the pores, though, so it is possible to hydrate the parchment and remove a crease without introducing liquid water to the pigmented image. This can be achieved by sandwiching a manuscript in Gore-Tex in varying ways to achieve the desired results. =Mending= Repairing a tear in a parchment with images or text on it is more of a challenge than mending a piece of parchment that does not have any such issues. Care must be taken to not cover up or obscure in any way the image or the text. Materials such as Goldbeater's skin can be made transparent enough to do this but great care still needs to be taken. Ethics The ethics of illuminated manuscript preservation involve the potential for adversely altering the source material during the course of the repair work. In order to ensure the integrity of the manuscript, great care must be taken during any preservation activity. Risk assessments should be made to determine the potential impact of preservation work on the manuscript, and weigh that against the potential benefits of the restoration work itself. In Depth on Conservation Challenges The Illuminated Book: Conserving an Art Form The term illuminated manuscript comes from two sources, both of which originated in Medieval Latin. The first is manuscriptus, a combination of manu ‚Äòby hand‚Äô and scriptus ‚Äòwritten‚Äô. The second is the Latin word illuminare, which translates to ‚Äòadorned‚Äô. It is this second term that immediately catches attention, letting readers know that this particular manuscript is special, illuminated or ‚Äòadorned.‚Äô An illuminated manuscript is a book, usually religious in nature, that has been intricately decorated with paints, inks, and metal leaf such as gold and silver. This can include full page illustrations, intricate initials at the beginning of paragraphs and chapters, and embellishment to particularly important areas of text. A surprising number of these books have survived the years to exist in the modern era; mostly thanks to their value and, in many cases, religious significance. Nonetheless, the very embellishments that allowed these books to survive are the reason that today's conservators find illuminated manuscripts more challenging to maintain than their plain counterparts. This is important not just to conservators, but to the historians who rely on them to trace the economic trends and artistic evolution in a time that is commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, or more properly known as the Migration Period (476‚Äì800 C.E.). Thousands of illuminated manuscripts have survived the ages, yet many are slowly being lost today because they are not being properly conserved. Illuminated manuscripts are some of the hardest books to conserve, but every effort must be made to preserve them not only for their own beauty and value but for their historical significance as some of the only surviving written records of an era. Part of the complexity of illuminated manuscripts lies in their historical context. An illuminated manuscript is, in simple terms, a decorated book. They usually contain both painted illustrations, embellished text, and illumination with gold and other precious metals. With the advent and propagation of Christianity in medieval Europe, illustrated books rapidly became a way to convey religious teachings in a time when most of the population was illiterate. Because of this purpose, most of the illuminated manuscripts to have survived the ages are religious in nature. In most cases, rich patrons or churches would commission the creation of their own copies of various religious scriptures. These were most commonly complete copies of the Bible or a subsection, such as individual books of the Old Testament, collections of 150 psalms, or collections of the first four books of the New Testament (Anderson 9). In later cases, when more people could read, books of hours were also widely called for. All of these books were created by either nuns or monks, usually in a scriptorium connected to their church or abbey. Outside of the church, there were some examples of secular texts being illuminated. Astronomical treatises and copies of classical writers were some of the first examples, emerging as the trend of owning personal copies of religious texts spread among the wealthy. Later, histories and chronicles became more popular, coinciding with the gradual spread of knowledge and the founding of universities throughout Europe in the latter part of the Middle Ages (Anderson 13). These books were still most often produced by church scribes and illuminators; however, they were commissioned by private citizens or universities rather than the church. Without the illuminated manuscripts historians have to study today, much of this information about the gradual return of wealth and learning in the Migration Period would be difficult or even impossible to accurately trace and date. There were many reasons for the creation of illuminated manuscripts, and these varied with each commission. However, the most common were either for teaching purposes or as shows of wealth. Because most common people were illiterate, they could only relate to stories of church doctrine through pictures rather than reading the words. Illustrating religious texts allowed people to see the stories that church leaders read to them, and to create a personal connection outside of the oral tradition. In this instance, illuminated manuscripts served the same purpose as stained glass windows in churches. They allowed the faithful to see the stories of their faith, lending them substance that might be absent from the spoken word. They could also serve as reminders of religious faith when a church service was not in progress. The second reason for the creation of illuminated manuscripts was as a show of wealth. In the case of church manuscripts, the books could both tell religious stories and remind the people of the power and wealth of the church. In the case of private commissions, the patron was able to demonstrate their wealth by purchasing lavish volumes for their personal libraries and chapels. This also served to demonstrate their fidelity to and strengthen their ties with the church, whose support and influence with the common people played a major part in keeping the upper class in power. Because all but the very smallest of local churches had at least a plain copy of the bible, the range from completely unadorned manuscripts to the lavish and intricate designs embellished with rich gold leaf seen in the more famous versions of the art are clearly represented. Where each book fell on this range closely reflected the wealth and influence of its owner, whether that was an upper-class individual or a town. While this influence is also represented in buildings and other archeological evidence such as coinage and works of art, the prevalence of illuminated manuscripts from different areas and time periods provides a sort of historical litmus test to the prosperity of the region. Before the invention of the printing press, making even the simplest book was a painstaking process. The paper was made by hand, the leather was prepared in tanneries, the binding threads were hand spun, and the inks were ground with a mortar and pestle. Even with all the materials assembled, the book still had to be stitched and glued together, then painstakingly written by hand by a scribe. Even so, hundreds of thousands of books were produced between the transition from papyrus scrolls to codices and the advent of the printing press. The initial transition that sparked this production occurred over time between the first and fifth centuries A.D. The transition from scrolls to codices began from a common tool used by merchants, the wax tablet. These tablets were simple panels covered in wax, which could be written in with a pointed stylus and then wiped clean again for reuse. They were normally kept together by rings passed through holes in their sides (Anderson 17). Once the format of a rectangular codex protected by hard or stiff covers had become a commonly known alternative to the scroll form previously used, it rapidly gained popularity for its durability and versatile applications. Over time, they became the standard form of written information. Gradually the intricate designs of tooled covers and decorated pages evolved to appeal to wealthy clients, and the books became an art form in and of themselves. Of these carefully created books, only about five percent were deemed important enough to be decorated with illustrations and illumination (Anderson 7). To understand the challenges conservators face when dealing with these intricately decorated books, it is first necessary to understand how they were made. Bookbinders used some of the same techniques used today to create hand bound books. Sheets were folded in half, so that each one would form two pages. These were then nested one inside the other to create a gathering. These gatherings could include as many pages as the bookbinder chose, however there were usually relatively few to prevent the gathering from becoming too bulky. An alternative method was to fold a very large sheet of paper repeatedly to create many pages, then slit three of the four sides with a knife to create a sheaf of pages (Hamel 39). Many gatherings were sown together though pre-punched holes known as sowing stations. The pattern of sowing stations and the use of the thread was what determined the structure of the binding. Because scribes and artists often needed access to the entire sheets of paper to do their work, books from this time period were often prepared in loose bindings that could be easily undone to free a sheet of paper (Hamel 40). For both illuminated and unadorned books, these loose bindings cause problems for conservators when they have not been properly and firmly bound after the writing and decorating was completed. Entire gatherings of pages can come loose, needing to be carefully re-stitched into their correct locations. Because of the wide variance in materials used in the bindings of books from the era that illuminated manuscripts were made, it is possible to trace some back to specific binderies, meaning that the materials can be analyzed to understand what trade was going on in that area at the time. For example, if a lavish cover was inlayed with lapis lazuli, if would be possible to infer that the bindery was able to source materials from as far east as Afghanistan (Alexander 40). Certain kinds of leather can also be traced back to specific geographical regions, as some breeds of cow and goat were only found in specific areas at this time. The pages used in books from this period also pose their own concerns. There were three main materials used for the pages of books in this time period: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper (Alexander 35). Papyrus was the primary writing material of the ancient world, and was created by beating stalks of the papyrus reed together until the fibers in the plant formed a tight, almost woven structure. Because it did not provide a stable surface for paint, this sort of paper was very rarely used for illuminated manuscripts. As for the paper most people would recognize today, the first true example was created in China around 105 A.D. using beaten, strained, and dried vegetable fibers such as tree bark. However, this paper was very expensive and generally had to be imported at the time that illuminated manuscripts were being widely made, so it appears less often than the third alternative, parchment (Permanence/Durability of the Book 11). It is worth noting that those manuscripts with paper pages are much harder to conserve, and the acids present in the plant fibers naturally cause it to yellow and break down over time. This process is irreversible, but can be slowed and limited by controlling the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of the paper. Turning to the final option, we reach the most common form of page used in illuminated manuscripts. Parchment and vellum are both made of very fine, prepared and treated animal skins that have been dried in a manner which leaves them flexible. The difference between them is that vellum is usually made with either goat, pig, or calf skin, while parchment is made from sheep skin (Langwell 44). Parchment provides an ideal surface for illumination, and was even placed into books which used other page materials in patches to allow for a good painting or illuminating surface (Alexander 35). This prevalent use of parchment provides some of the historical significance of illuminated manuscripts. The different kinds of hide used can be DNA tested with modern equipment, and often tell historians what area the book is from and sometimes where the hide was sourced from, mapping trade routes and patterns otherwise lost to history. There is one key conservation problem with parchment and vellum that was discovered even while it was being widely used: it is very susceptible to water damage. Not only does it mold quickly in high humidity environments, but early forms of ink that were commonly used on papyrus could simply be washed off without leaving a trace. It is believed that \\"Iron gall inks were devised to overcome this disadvantage,\\" however even these inks can be wiped off fairly thoroughly if they are scrubbed (Langwell 43). The issue of proper inks used on parchment also carries over to the paints used in the illustrations. This set of problems is truly unique to decorated books, and is the beginning of just what sets them apart as conservation challenges as opposed to their plain counterparts. In particular, the brilliant blue color of paint that is seen in many of the finest examples of the art is a challenge. Made from ground lapis lazuli this was the most expensive color of paint, as it was sourced from far away Afghanistan (Alexander 40). Any book bearing this color would have been especially costly, and helps to map the economic structure of Migration Period Europe through the supply chain used to create it and the person wealthy enough to afford it. Unfortunately, this particularly precious color is also the most difficult for conservators. It is prone to flaking and cupping, a form of contraction which causes the paint to crack and curve outwards in many little flakes, giving the appearance of tiny shingles that have been flipped upside-down. This means that even the slightest friction can catch the raised edges and cause the paint to flake off. It must be carefully consolidated with a nonreactive adhesive, without damaging other surrounding decoration (Clarkson 47). Many other paints used at the time were also poisonous. The compositions of many paints were discovered using Raman spectroscopy, a noninvasive method of analysis that bounces light off of a given pigment and reads back the compositions based on witch wavelengths are absorbed and reflected (De 75). Using this and other spectroscopic methods, it has been determined that the very common red pigment found in these books was created from red lead, or, more dangerously, the highly toxic compound cinnabar. Another variant of this common color was vermillion, created using heated mercury and sulfur. Yellow was often made using poisonous orpiment, or arsenic sulfide, and white was almost invariably created using lead. While there are some organic alternatives, such as yellow made from saffron, it is unknown if even a single illuminated manuscript does not contain toxic materials. These compounds can pose a danger to conservators, researchers, or those putting the books of display if they are aerated and should be carefully consolidated and never abraded. While many other paints and inks were used by the artist decorating the books, these examples convey both the wide ranges of the colors used and the dangers they posed. This added level of difficulty is a good example of what makes illuminated manuscripts harder to deal with than plan books. It is also worth noting that while the paints were a finishing measure for the book the painter did not actually do any designing. An earlier drawling would have set out the pattern and clearly labeled with colors should go where in places that would be covered with paint. These patterns and labels are visible using various imaging techniques. Some scribes also wrote or made small drawings in the margins of the books, often providing historians with a window into the life on the average man in the Migration Period. These little annotations are some of the only surviving records of everyday life from the time commonly known as the Dark Ages. Complaints about long work hours and little drawings of people and monsters can be seen both in the margins and in some cases under the paint of the illustrations. The tradition of illustrating texts goes all the way back to the cradle of civilization, evolving through Egypt and the cultures of the Mediterranean. However, it was far less common for books and papers to be embellished with precious metals, and this aspect of illuminated manuscripts adds another facet of difficulty for conservators that is not found elsewhere. In the Middle Ages, gold was the symbol of royalty, a clear sign of wealth and status. Yet for all of that, it was actually fairly common. Indeed, by the late Middle Ages the most common use for gold was in coinage (De 65). Because of this, using small quantities of the precious metal in a book was not prohibitively expensive. Gold, and all other metals used for illumination, was hammered into incredibly thin sheets, allowing a tiny amount of gold to cover a large area. This thin sheet was then adhered to the pages using the particular illuminator's formula of adhesive. This variation in adhesives mean that if any work needs to be done by a conservator, several tests must be undergone to ensure that no modern consolidation or adhesive will react with, damage, or loosen the old glue. While this is an issue for conservators, in rare cases a glue can be traced to a specific bindery, thus placing the book in its correct area and context, making it far more useful to historians. Another challenge for conservators lies in the fact that the gold used in books was not always pure. Alloys of gold can be subject to corrosion, with can cause darkening of the metal, reaction with the adhesives and other paint, and staining of the paper. This is an inherent vice of illuminations done with pure silver as well. Regardless of the care and treatment, silver corrodes and darkens over time. While modern conservators have ways of limiting this though control of humidity, older books have often seen their illumination corrode to the point that to attempt to clean it would simply remove the metal entirely. Conservation in the modern era does not only face issues with the objects themselves. While a corroded book is one issue, how to display that book to the public is another, potentially more complex problem. From a conservator's point of view, to best protect a book it should be placed in a controlled, dark environment, then swaddled in padding with plenty of circulating air and tightly controlled relative humidity. Once old damage has been repaired, the goal is to keep new damage from occurring. However, most illuminated manuscripts belong to museums and libraries. Moreover, these beautiful works are the pride of the collection in most cases, and any curator will naturally want their most enticing items on display to woo the visiting public. In addition, part of the cultural value of the books is what they can teach us about the missing part of history commonly known as the Dark Ages. Historians will often want to study and run tests on the books in hopes of learning something about the time and place they were made, such as what trade was present. Thus comes one of the great ethical issues in the field of conservation, the problem of preservation versus access. The question most often faced by conservators is how to display a book to the least damage for the longest time. The light that enables visitors to see the books also breaks down the lignin structures in paper pages, fades paints, and embrittles leather. The cradle that holds the book open for viewing may also strain the spine. These are only two of the myriad issues that must be addressed when dealing with these fragile books. Even more arise when tests need to be run or a historian wants to handle a book. Removing a sliver of paint for analysis by a mass spectrometer may reveal information about trade routes, but it also damages the book. Likewise, inspecting the drawings and inscriptions in the margins provides a unique historical window, but a careless historian might touch the page and damage fragile and flaking paint. Not all institutions have the funds to properly care for their collections either. While a few famous examples claim the spotlight in major institutions, small museums, libraries, and religious centers put their own, smaller treasures on display to the public without the expertise of a conservator to aid them. The complex challenges of illuminated manuscripts make them a uniquely troublesome medium for conservation. Their illumination, adhesives, paints, inks, papers, and even their very bindings can pose issues ranging from toxic chemicals to lost pages. Some of these issues are universal to book conservation. The troubles with ink on parchment pages and of loose bindings can be found in any book contemporary to the Medieval and Migration Periods. Yet illuminated manuscripts take these usual issues and add to them with poisonous paint, corroding metals, and uniquely challenging materials such as the luxuriously expensive yet eternally flaking lapis lazuli paint. Illuminated manuscripts are also problematic because of their popularity amongst displays. For these reasons and many others, illuminated manuscripts are clearly more challenging to conservators than their plainer contemporaries. Hidden away in private collections and small institutions, some of these books are gradually falling into disrepair. This fact is all the more important when you look past the aesthetic and monetary value of these books and realize that they are some of the only surviving written pieces from a time when there is so little historical information available that textbooks call it the Dark Ages. In the future, as technology evolves, it may be possible to gradually bring the economy and social system of the Migration Period into the light by carefully analyzing these books. Digital preservation Manuscript preservation may also take the form of digital archiving, which is particularly useful for vulnerable manuscripts and fragments susceptible to deterioration such as the burnt fragments extant from the Cotton library fire which have now been recorded using multispectral imaging by the British Library. Fragmentarium (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments) is an online database which, since September 2017, preserves and collates fragments of medieval manuscripts making them available to researchers, collectors and historians worldwide. It is an international collaboration of major libraries and collections including the British Library, Harvard, Stanford, Yale and the Vatican. Works cited Anderson, Janice. Illuminated Manuscripts.

She was the sister of Margaret of Hungary and Kinga of Poland (Cunegunda). One of her paternal aunts was the Franciscan Elizabeth of Hungary.  Life  As a young girl, Yolanda was sent to Poland to be tutored under the supervision of her sister, Kinga, who was married to the Duke of Poland. There, she was encouraged to marry Boles≈Çaw the Pious, which she did in 1257. They had three daughters: * Elisabeth of Kalisz (1263 ‚Äì 28 September 1304); married Henry V, Duke of Legnica; * Hedwig of Kalisz (1266 ‚Äì 10 December 1339); married W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, King of Poland; * Anna of Kalisz (born 1278, date of death unknown); a nun in Gniezno. During the time of her marriage, she was noted for her great services to the poor and needy of the country, as well as being a major benefactor of the monasteries, friaries and hospitals connected to them. Her husband gave her so much support in her charities that he earned the nickname \\"the Pious\\". She was widowed in 1279. Religious work Following Boleslaus' death, Yolanda and Kinga, along with one of Yolanda's daughters, Anna, retired to the Poor Clare monastery that Kinga had founded in Sandez. Forced to relocate due to armed conflict in the region, Yolanda founded a new monastery in Gniezno. She was persuaded to become abbess of the community of nuns shortly before her death.

It is set in the Italian seaside resort of Riccione in July 1943, around the time of the dismissal of Benito Mussolini, during the Allied invasion of Sicily in World War II. Estate violenta is Zurlini's second feature film, with which he made his name as a director.Biography of Valerio Zurlini Plot Carlo Caremoli (Trintignant) arrives in Riccione, and enjoys life together with his friends at his father's villa. Riccione is still peaceful, and only a few things remind about the war fought in the south. On seaside holiday, the youth witness a German fighter flying low over the beach and causing panic among the crowd. Carlo tries to protect a frightened little girl who runs toward him, and meets her mother, Roberta (Rossi Drago), a naval officer's widow. Carlo is attracted to Roberta, often meets her and even makes a trip with her to San Marino, although Roberta's mother (Lilla Brignone) disapproves of this new acquaintance, and urges her to stay away from Carlo, partly because of his father, Ettore Caremoli (Enrico Maria Salerno), a brutal Fascist. Meanwhile, Maddalena (Federica Ranchi), the young sister of Roberta's deceased husband, arrives from Catanzaro, fleeing the impending war. Maddalena spends time with Carlo's friends, and together with Roberta, is invited to a circus. However, the show is interrupted by an air raid blackout, and the friends proceed to a nighttime party at Carlo's villa. After watching flares in the night sky, the men and women form couples and start dancing to a record of Temptation, Carlo with his girlfriend Rosanna (Jacqueline Sassard), and Roberta with a much younger boy. The camera cuts between Carlo and Roberta, staring at each other passionately. Carlo asks Roberta for the next dance, and the couple end up kissing in the garden, which deeply hurts Rosanna. The next day, Roberta initially refuses to admit her true feelings to Carlo, but ultimately accedes. Meanwhile, on 25 July, the news of Mussolini's ouster is announced. Carlo and Roberta continue to go on dates. However, Carlo's father is forced to flee, and his villa is confiscated. Carlo meets Roberta once again and spends a night with her, provoking discontent from her mother, and Maddalena decides to leave. During a curfew, a patrol discovers the couple on the beach and finds out that Carlo's military exemption has expired. As his father has fled, he has no chance to renew it anymore. Roberta proposes that he hide at her villa in Rovigo, and the next morning they take a train. However, during the trip the tracks are bombed by the Allies, and the couple barely escape death. After the air raid, Roberta gets back on the train, but Carlo refuses to join her until the war is over, and they part as the train leaves.

Started in the middle of the 2000s with their English repertoire with a bit of Belarusian songs, they have changed the language of songwriting mostly just to Russian in recent years. Since 2006, they have released two full albums and several EP and singles, but nowadays the musicians play together mostly as a cover band. In addition to that, since March 2017 Vitaliy Matievskiy, frontman of the band, promotes his synth-pop duo Days of Days and since June 2018 he also writes music for his solo electronic music project MATIVI. History Band's history dates back to January 2006, when Seva Maslov (bass) and Vitaliiy Matievsky (vocal, guitar) first met. They had one thing in common ‚Äì they wanted to start a rock band. By that time, both had some music training and Seva played in a few local bands before. The band's first rehearsal on 12 March 2006 became the date of the band's birth, but it was only after Maxim Mestovskiy (guitar) and Andrey Malashenko (drums) became part of the band, when Open Space was fully formed. Maxim joined the band after second rehearsal, while Andrey came in September 2006, when Open Space decided to replace their previous drummer. He was already a local music scene veteran, played in popular Belarusian bands Indiga, Papenkinz Band, Leprikonsy, L.I.P, Po Glazam, and Impat. In June, 2007 Open Space recorded their first demo EP- disc \\"Wake Up\\". The presentation of this album took place in the \\"Graffity\\" club in Minsk on 13 September. All tickets were sold out in a few hours. With the growing popularity, Open Space made a tour across Belarus and Russia. Soon songs 'In My Head', 'Today', 'Song of the Seaman', and 'Wake Up' from their first EP became very popular and are still broadcast at prime time on most popular Belarusian radio stations. During 2008, Open Space played concerts with popular Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian, and international bands: Morandi, Segodnyanochyu, Multfilmy, Sergey Babkin (former of 5'nizza), Singleton, Bi-2, Retrieved September 2000 and Hair Peace Salon.

Burkina Faso, like France and several other countries, draws a separation between administrative policing and judicial policing. The former deals with the general maintenance of law and order. The latter relates to criminal investigations. Following the introduction of the 2003 law on public security, Burkina Faso has since 2005 adopted a community policing approach. This applies to police and the gendarmerie. France continues to provide significant training assistance. Police =National Police= The National Police, or Police nationale du Burkina Faso, is responsible for the maintaining public peace, supporting the security of the State and institutions, protecting people and property, collecting information on behalf of the government, and maintaining links with foreign law enforcement bodies. The national police is accountable to the Minister of administration, decentralization and security.Interpol: Burkina Faso The national police has both administrative and judicial police powers. Unlike Commonwealth countries or the USA, individual officers may not all hold judicial powers. They thus may only be empowered to temporarily detain suspects, but not formally arrest them. =Municipal Police= The municipal police, or Police municipale, are forces which answer directly to the mayor of a town. They generally enforce law and order (police administrative) but do not have investigative powers (police judiciaire). The municipal police is a recent addition to the security forces. A municipal police had first been created in 1977, but was abolished 1 January 1984 in the early days of the Thomas Sankara revolution. The existence of the new municipal police stems from the administrative decentralization laws of 3 and 6 August 1998. Each of the 345 communes in Burkina Faso may choose to organize a municipal police. As of 2009, 22 communes employing a total of complement of 760 agents had done so. While they are not accountable to the same organisations, the municipal police entertains close links with the national police, mainly as the national police provides all training and administrative and managerial support, and that they often are called to operate in proximity to each other. The municipal police works infrequently with the Gendarmerie and other security forces. Gendarmerie The Gendarmerie as a paramilitary force: Burkinabe Gendarmes undergoing crowd- control training delivered by US Marines in 2013. The Gendarmerie Nationale has a dual purpose. It acts as both a military force and a police force. It answers to the Minister of Defense. The gendarmerie is primarily stationed in rural and border areas. As a police force, it performs judicial and administrative policing, similarly to the national police. Other forces =Presidential Guards= Established in 1995 by President Blaise Compaor√©, the R√©giment de la s√©curit√© pr√©sidentielle provides security to the president. Because the unit answers directly to the president's Chief of Staff, it is unaccountable to the minister of defense. =Prison guards= Prison guards answer to the Minister of Justice. It is worth noting that they detain both civilian and military prisoners. =Customs= The Customs service falls under the authority of the Minister of Finance.

The police falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security. It is separate from the National Intelligence Service (SNR), the state intelligence agency. Origins and structure Under Belgian rule (1916‚Äì62), policing in Burundi was the responsibility of a small unit of the Force Publique, a gendarmerie with a combined military function, recruited largely within the Belgian Congo. Its members were popularly known as Bamina in Burundi, after the large military base at Kamina in the Congo. It was replaced by the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) after independence in 1962, though this became part of the army under the military dictatorships after 1967. A separate civilian police force was re-established in 1990 as the Public Security Police (Police de s√©curit√© publique) which co-existed with the Gendarmerie. The PNB was founded in December 2004, following the end of the Burundian Civil War and the Arusha Accords. Its stated objectives are the maintenance of public order, the protection of the population, and the fight against organised crime. Its objective was to provide a single, integrated police force under the leadership of a single Directorate-General (Direction g√©n√©rale), replacing the previous system of administrative fragmentation. The PNB is divided into missions, dealing with separate areas as well as five regional commissariats. The different services include: *Internal Security Police (Police de s√©curit√© int√©rieure) *Judicial Police (Police judiciaire) *Air Police (Police de l'Air) *Border and Aliens Police (Police des fronti√®res et des √©trangers) *Prison Police (Police p√©nitentiaire) Most of Burundi's police force is concentrated in Bujumbura, the de facto capital city, and other major urban centres. The PNB members are armed, often with \\"Kalashnikov-type assault rifles\\". Burundi has been a member of INTERPOL since 1970. Burundian police have been deployed abroad as part of United Nations (UN) operations in Africa. Criticism Burundian police on patrol in the Central African Republic in 2014 as part of the African Union-led MISCA force Corruption is a major problem for the PNB. According to a 2014 survey by Afrobarometer, the PNB is widely considered the most corrupt of Burundi's public services. Transparency International reported that over 80 percent of Burundians believed that there was corruption within the police service in 2014. The Burundian government has tried to resolve the corruption problem with the aid of foreign assistance from countries including the Netherlands. Although little effective citizen oversight exists, there is theoretically a police ombudsman and attorney general, both tasked with dealing with complaints against police. According to the US Department of State, the Burundian National Police \\"is largely of former rebel fighters, lacks accountability and has minimal capacity to respond to crises and investigate crimes in a just manner in accordance with human rights\\". However, 2014 polling also indicated that 54‚Äì83 percent of Burundians had \\"confidence\\" in the PNB and approximately 65 percent of the population claim to respect the PNB and believed it is disciplined. The PNB was frequently used to suppress anti-government protests during the popular unrest in Burundi in 2015. Police violence against protesters, both in the form of beatings and shootings, was particularly criticised by Human Rights Watch. As a response, in 2016, the UN decided to repatriate 280 Burundian police from the MINUSCA mission in the Central African Republic because of accusations that its personnel had committed atrocities in Burundi before their departure. Burundi also refused an offer by the UN Security Council to deploy 288 UN police officers to Burundi in August 2016. Further abuses continued into 2018.

He was second-in-command, during Colonel George Rogers Clark's 1778 military expedition to capture the Illinois Country, in which Clark and his men seized the key British-controlled towns of Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes. Following the 1779 campaign and defeat of the British forces, in Vincennes, Bowman was critically injured in an accidental gunpowder explosion and subsequently died of his wounds. He was the only American officer killed during the 1778-1779 Illinois campaign.English, Conquest of the Country, 1:108. Joseph Bowman kept a daily journal of his trek from Kaskaskia to Vincennes, which is one of the best primary source accounts of Clark's victorious campaign. Early life Joseph Bowman was born in Frederick County, Virginia, the son of George Bowman and Mary Hite, Anglicized from their original, German names, Hans Georg Baumann and Marie Elisabetha Hite. His maternal grandfather was Jost Hite, a German immigrant credited, as the first white, European colonist to settle west of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia.English, Conquest of the Country, 1:112. In 1732, Hite led his extended family, including his daughter Mary and her husband, George Bowman, to the Shenandoah Valley, near present-day Winchester, Frederick County, Virginia. Jost Hite distributed land, that he owned, to his family and to other settlers‚Äîclaims, which would later be contested in Hite v. Fairfax, a landmark Virginia land case. Joseph Bowman was born at Fort Bowman, near present-day Strasburg, Shenandoah County, Virginia. In 1774, Joseph Bowman served in the Virginia colonial militia, during Lord Dunmore's War. Other Virginians, who served with him in the war, included George Rogers Clark and Leonard Helm. Soon after Dunmore's War, Bowman moved to Kentucky with other British colonists, who were seeking available land on the western frontier. In 1777, Joseph Bowman was living in the frontier settlement of Harrodstown, in present-day Harrodsburg, Mercer County, Kentucky.English, Conquest of the Country, 1:83. On September 11, 1777, thirty-seven men from the area gathered at Bowman's property to shell corn and were attacked by Indians. One white settler was killed and six others were wounded, before the Indians were driven off.English, 1:83 Revolutionary War service Joseph Bowman and three of his brothers served in the American Revolutionary War. Bowman is sometimes, confused with his brother, Colonel John Bowman, a prominent leader of the Kentucky frontier settlements, of the Virginia State Forces, during the war.Butterfield, History of Clark's Conquest, 294n. Joseph Bowman served, as a captain, during George Rogers Clark's campaign, into the Illinois Country and was present, at the capture of Fort Gage in Kaskaskia, on July 4, 1778. Captain Bowman later, moved north, leading an ununiformed, combined American, mostly Virginian and locally-born, Illinois Country, French/transplanted French Canadien force, to capture Prairie du Rocher and CahokiaLetter from Joseph Bowman to George Brinker from The First American West: The Ohio River Valley, 1750-1820 at the Library of Congress Fort de Chartres and Cahokia, where Bowman remained, for a time, as the commanding officer of the renamed Fort Bowman.English, 1:197 When Fort Sackville, renamed Fort Patrick Henry and Captain Leonard Helm, the Virginia state militia commander, were captured by British Lt-Governor Henry \\"Hair Buyer\\" Hamilton, in late 1778, Captain Bowman marched with Colonel Clark, in February 1779, across , to lay siege to the British forces at Vincennes. Joseph Bowman also, participated in the negotiations for their surrender. After the British surrender, the American flag was raised and the fort was renamed Fort Patrick Henry, on February 24, 1779. Within days, a dispatch from the Governor of Virginia arrived, with commissions promoting Clark to general, and Bowman to major. For his services rendered, Major Bowman was granted a total of in land north of the Ohio River, known as \\"Clark's Grant.\\"English, 2:839 Death In celebration, of the end, of General Clark's Illinois campaign, a six-pounder cannon was fired on February 25, 1779. During the cannon salute, some of the artillery gunpowder charges accidentally ignited, wounding Captain Edward Worthington, four privates, a captured British soldier, and critically wounding Captain Bowman. Oddly enough, General Clark made no mention of the tragic cannon accident in his memoir. However, Clark does describe Major Bowman leading soldiers, as late as June 1779. Due to the severe burn wounds he received, the health of Major Bowman deteriorated, causing him to die, at Fort Patrick Henry, on August 14, 1779.English, 1:109 is a facsimile of Bowman's death certificate. The last page of his journal is blank, except for an anonymous notation: \\"God save the [Virginia] commonwealth, this 15th day of August, 1779.\\"English 1:374 says Bowman probably died on August 15 and was buried August 18. A bronze grave marker with the date of August 18, 1779 was later, placed in the St. Francis Xavier Cemetery, adjacent to the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park, Vincennes, Knox County, Indiana, though he was buried somewhere along the Wabash River.

The National Police Force shares responsibility for internal security with the Gendarmerie, a paramilitary organization; the police are responsible exclusively for urban areas, while the Gendarmerie's primary responsibility is for rural areas, though it may also reinforce the police when needed. According to The Wall Street Journal, each organization has approximately 5,000 personnel, while Interpol gives a figure of over 7,000 for the police. In October 2015, Moussa Ag Infahi replaced Hamidou Kansaye as Director General of the National Police, while Colonel-Major Satigui Dit Moro Sidib√© became the new Director General of the Gendarmerie, succeeding Colonel- Major Mody B√©r√©t√©. Local police districts are headed by commissioners, who report to regional directors at national police headquarters. The police are poorly trained, equipped and led, and suffer from low morale. Corruption is also a problem. Following the 2013 national elections, Mali's new government made improving the police a priority and accepted the assistance of various countries and external organizations, including Japan; the United Nations Development Programme; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, through the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA); and a European Union Training Mission.

Organization  The 1999 Constitution brought about a reorganization of the law enforcement organization in Niger. The National Police, the National Guard (then the National Forces of Intervention and Security (NFIS or FNIS in French)) were removed from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense and placed under the control of the Ministry of the Interior. The Ministry of Defense retained control of the Gendarmerie Nationale which is responsible for national policing outside urban areas. The law enforcement system of Niger and the criminal justice system of Niger are both modeled after their counterparts in the French systems. The police emergency telephone number is 17.Niger. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2004. Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. February 28, 2005 The National Police The national police is led by a Director General of the National Police who answers to the Ministry of Interior. The National Police has several responsibilities: public security (policing and security, prevention), judicial police (investigation and prosecution), territorial surveillance and general surveillance (general or specialized surveillance as well as administrative investigations). Gouvernance du secteur de la s√©curit√© en Afrique de l‚ÄôOuest: les d√©fis √† relever ‚Äì Le Niger Of all the responsibilities, public safety is the most important focus of the national police in terms of resource allocations. However, in recent years, increasing resources are being devoted to territorial surveillance as terrorist threats in the region have increased since the fall of the Libyan regime and the beginning of crisis in the north of Mali. Each of the eight regions of Niger has a regional office of public safety, whose director has authority over all police elements in the region. Public safety is ensured by the police precincts in urban areas and are responsible maintaining public order as well as fight minor crimes (theft, assault, fraud, violence, etc..). The judicial police deals high delinquency and organized crimes. National Guard of Niger Formerly known as the National Forces of Intervention and Security, the National Guard of Niger is responsible for security in rural areas where the national police is absent. It is overseen by the superior commander of the National Guard who reports to the Ministry of Interior. This body is responsible for: border and territorial surveillance of the country, public safety, maintaining and restoring of order, protecting public buildings and institutions, people and their property, the execution of the administrative police in rural and pastoral areas, management and monitoring of prisons, humanitarian actions in the case of national disaster or crisis and protection of the environment. It is also responsible for providing security to administrative authorities and the diplomatic and consular representations of Niger abroad. Etats de lieux de la formation des forces de defense et de securit√© sur le droit de l‚Äôenfant au Niger The National Gendarmerie The National Gendarmerie is commanded by the Superior Commander of the National Gendarmerie. Unlike the National Police and the National Guard, the National Gendarmerie is under the control of the Ministry of Defense of Niger. It is divided between territorial brigades and mobile brigades. In addition to territorial defense and maintaining public order, it provides military and paramilitary justice to other corps of the armed forces and participates to the judicial and the surveillance police activities. It is regarded as an elite force due to its stringent recruitment criteria of all armed forces. Due to increasing cross-border traffic of weapons and drugs, its activities have increased border areas. The national gendarmerie, unlike the Army or the National Guard, has never been directly involved in an attempt to seize or control power by force. Detention, pretrial and trial Police detention period is limited to 48 hours without evidence. However, if police failed to gather sufficient evidence within the detention period, the prosecutor has the right to give the case to another officer subject to another 48 hours window. However, to start this procedure, the prosecutor must present compiling arguments to the judge. A defendant has the right to a lawyer immediately upon detention, and bail is available for crimes carrying a penalty of less than 10 years' imprisonment. The law generally requires that police conducting a search have a warrant, normally issued by a judge. Under the State Security Law, police may conduct searches without warrants when they have strong suspicion that a house shelters criminals or stolen property.  Customary law in law enforcement in Niger  Traditional chiefs act as mediators and counselors and have authority in customary law cases as well as status under national law, where they were designated as auxiliaries to local officials. Customary courts, located only in large towns and cities, try cases involving divorce or inheritance. They are headed by a legal practitioner with basic legal training who is advised by an assessor knowledgeable in the society's traditions. The judicial actions of chiefs and customary courts are not regulated by law, and defendants can appeal a verdict to the formal court system.  Shortcoming in law enforcement in Niger  Ignorance of the law and lack of financial means have been cited as some of the reasons for shortcomings in law enforcement in Niger. These shortcomings includes severe backlog in the judicial system due to lack of resources, lengthy pretrial detentions due to ignorance of the law and denial of rights. Despite legal limits to the pretrial detention, there have been reports of pretrial detention lasting many decades with reasonable arguments for reasons of charges charges. Although the freedom of journalism is protected by the constitution and generally protected by institutions, security forces have been blamed to occasionally detain journalists and opposition politicians for political motives. Accusations of corruption are common particularly at police and gendarmerie roadblocks and checkpoints on urban roads as well as highways. The checkpoints are designed to check for papers, to collect tolls or internal tax on goods and to enforce laws and regulations. In customary law, women generally are assessed by foreign observers as not having equal legal status with men in the traditional and customary courts and do not enjoy the same access to legal redress.

After the merger with Sirius in 2008, Escape started incorporating more vocal tracks into its playlist (to compensate for the loss of Sirius' more soft-AC based Movin' Easy channel), but these were quickly reduced after complaints.

Blaine, the leader of the Half-Breeds. The \\"Half-Breeds\\" were a political faction of the United States Republican Party in the late 19th century. The Half-Breeds were a moderate group, and were the opponents of the Stalwarts, the other main faction of the Republican Party. The main issue that divided the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds was political patronage. The Stalwarts were in favor of political machines and spoils system-style patronage, while the Half-Breeds, led by Maine senator James G. Blaine, were in favor of civil service reform and a merit system.https://www.vox.com/2016/7/20/12233454/christie-trump-purge-federal- employees The epithet \\"Half-Breed\\" was invented in derision by the Stalwarts to denote those whom they perceived as being only half Republican. In the 1880 Republican National Convention, the Stalwart candidate, former president Ulysses S. Grant, was pitted against Half-Breed James G. Blaine for the party nomination. Grant's campaign was led by Stalwart leader Roscoe Conkling of New York, the state with the deepest split between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds. Despite Conkling's attempts at imposing a unit-rule in the Republican National Convention by which a state's votes would be grouped together for only one candidate, a number of Stalwarts went against him by vocalizing their support for the Half-Breed Blaine. The Half-Breeds united to defeat the unit-rule in a vote, and elected Half-Breed George Frisbie Hoar to the position as temporary chairman of the convention.Hoar was later appointed as permanent chairman of the convention. Both sides knew there was no chance of victory for either candidate, and the Half-Breeds chose James Garfield as a compromise candidate. Garfield won the party's nomination on the thirty-sixth ballot,Ackerman (2003), p120-121. and won the 1880 presidential election.Ackerman (2003), p. 221. Blaine was chosen as Garfield's Secretary of State, and carried heavy influence over the political appointments Garfield issued for congressional approval. After Garfield was assassinated by Charles J. Guiteau, a Stalwart, who proclaimed, \\"I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts and Arthur will be President\\",Ackerman (2003), p. 384. the new Stalwart president Chester A. Arthur surprised those in his own faction by promoting civil service reform and issuing government jobs based on a merit system. The Half-Breeds put through Congress the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act (authored by Democrat George H. Pendleton), and Arthur signed the bill into law on January 16, 1883. The act put an end to the spoils system, at least symbolically, placing a significant number of federal employees under the merit system and putting the government on the road to true reform. The act also set up the United States Civil Service Commission, banished political tests, denied jobs to alcoholics and created competitive measures for some federal positions.Sauer (2000), p. 291.

Background In 2003, Lalah Hathaway appeared with Sanctuary, Pyramid, Mesa, and Blue Moon Records. In 2004, Hathaway released a cover version of Luther Vandross's song \\"Forever, For Always, For Love\\". The song later appeared on the all-star tribute album \\"Forever, For Always, For Luther\\". The album features production from Rex Rideout, Mike City, and Chris Parks. Outrun The Sky was also released as an Enhanced CD. Music With the roster of 13 tracks, Allmusic.com chose the album picks to be \\"Forever, For Always, For Love\\", \\"Back Then\\", and \\"Boston\\". The songs of album use the instruments of a keyboard, organ, guitars, drums, bass, and trumpet, which were demonstrated on the songs \\"Better and Better\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"If U Ever\\", and \\"How Many Times\\". Allmusic also went on to the describe the album's mood as Warm, Reflective, Passionate, Smooth, Lush, Romantic, Calm/Peaceful, Intimate, Soothing, and Sensual.[ Outrun the Sky Review] AllMusic. Retrieved: May 15, 2009 The track, \\"Better And Better\\" began as a track intended for an Eric Benet album of the same name. His finished track is the same as the one used on this album. Eric Benet's lead and backgrounds were simply removed and Lalah's were added. Promotion Following the album's two singles, Hathaway went on the Daughters of Soul tour. Hathaway toured along with Sandra St. Victor, Nona Hendryx, Indira Khan (daughter of Chaka Khan), Simone (daughter of Nina Simone), and Joyce Kennedy of Mother's Finest. Singles *Forever, For Always, For Love was released the lead single and peaked #1 on the Adult R&B; charts. Forever, For Always, For Love became Hathaway's first single to chart on the Billboard's Hot 100, charting at #112 and #37 on the Hot R&B; charts. *Better and Better was released as the album's second single. The song received no promotion and no music video. The result left the song to debut at #121 on the Hot R&B; charts. Reviews The album received a review from David Jeffries of AllMusic. David Jeffries responded, \\"Few mainstream artists can keep the lazy release schedule Don Hathaway's daughter does and retain a strong fan base. It's been a whole decade since Lalah Hathaway released one of her own albums and half that long since she joined Joe Sample for The Song Lives On. It's her warm voice, smooth delivery, and allegiance to fad-free R&B; that keeps the faithful patiently waiting. Delivering on all counts, Outrun the Sky is a fan's dream and the singer's best showcase since her debut. While The Song Lives On was more ambitious and in turn brought more fans, Outrun the Sky is a better showcase. Not only does Hathaway cover a wider spectrum of tones and moods but she also producers and writes most of the highlights of the album. Her stream-of- consciousness lyrics for the title track give a more personal picture of the artist and paint her as an approachable dreamer who's as unsure as anyone. Hathaway's inspired writing is responsible for many of the other warm and reflective winners but it's the closing \\"Boston\\" that best illustrates how this husky voiced siren can conjure up a cosmopolitan song and deliver it with heart. Including her smoky take on Luther Vandross' \\"Forever, for Always, for Love\\" from the Forever, for Always, for Luther tribute is the icing on this cool cake. The ballad-heavy album still has its fair share of grooves that are rooted in R&B; but the overall easy temperament isn't going to alienate any of Hathaway's smooth jazz converts. Nice to have her back; here's to a shorter wait next time.\\"[ Outrun the Sky Overview] AllMusic. Retrieved: May 15, 2009 David Nathan of Soulmusic.com also reviewed the album. \\"Fortunately, the year 2004 brought about a change: the release of father Donny‚Äôs ‚ÄúThese Songs For You, Live‚Äù (which I had the honor of producing along with my good friend A. Scott Galloway) was an omen of things to come. Some months later came ‚ÄúOutrun The Sky‚Äù and says Lalah, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to make a record for ten years and no matter how many people buy it, it‚Äôs already a success for me. I recorded it for the people who love my music and who love my Daddy so whatever happens now, it‚Äôs all a bonus. You see, I‚Äôve been blessed to be able to play with people like the late Grover Washington Jr. and Joe Sample even without having a record out there myself. That‚Äôs what kept me going as a musician, reminding me of what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing out here. And I‚Äôve always been very blessed: my peers have always been very complimentary so it‚Äôs never been a question for me and I know music is my life‚Äôs purpose. It‚Äôs in my blood.‚Äù Lalah took an active hand in the creative process with ‚ÄúOutrun The Sky‚Äù, writing or co-writing nine songs on the album and producing or co-producing six of them. Others contributing to the project included Mike City, Chris Parks & Vivian Sessoms, Rex Rideout & Bud Harner and David Delhomme (who co- produced four tracks with Lalah). Standouts include the bluesy ‚ÄúWe Were 2,‚Äù the gentle-yet-melancholy ‚ÄúBoston,‚Äù ‚ÄúBetter And Better,‚Äù ‚ÄúMore‚Äù and the title track. Commenting on a couple of the cuts, Lalah notes, ‚ÄúThe song ‚ÄúBoston‚Äù was written back in 1993 after I moved to Los Angeles. It's the most personal song on the album: the lyrics definitely come from the heart. I was sitting in my apartment in the [San Fernando] Valley and the temperature was 104 degrees and I was miserable. I was homesick, missing all my friends and musicians in Boston. I just sat there and the whole song came out. Then, the title track is really ‚Äòme‚Äô ‚Äì it's got that ‚Äòspace-cadet‚Äô-like flavor to it. It's esoteric, slightly ‚Äòflower-child‚Äô-like. It has a bluesy flavor and I think people like it because it reminds them of my father's music.‚Äù The song ‚ÄúBetter And Better‚Äù was, according to Lalah, ‚Äúoriginally written for Eric Benet. I harassed [the producer] Mike City for years for the song because I always loved it.‚Äù The album, Lalah says, ‚Äúis really about my life over the last decade and while there isn‚Äôt really a theme, it‚Äôs about the spoils and victories of growing up and coming out the other side.‚Äù With the release of ‚ÄùOutrun The Sky,‚Äù Lalah is busy promoting the album and performing but she's quick to note that ‚Äòlive‚Äô shows have been a key part of her activities for the last few years. ‚ÄúPromoters and folks in the industry would give you a lot of b.s. and have you believe you can‚Äôt have a career without a record but I‚Äôve been playing a lot during the last two years and selling out almost everywhere we‚Äôve been. It did surprise me but I‚Äôve learned you can do alright even without having records out [every year].‚Äù Inevitably, when Lalah performs there are some songs that are mandatory pieces in her repertoire, mostly notably her own ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Coming Back‚Äù and the song ‚ÄúWhen Your Life Was Low‚Äù from her album with Joe Sample. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs become something of a signature tune for me,‚Äù says Lalah. ‚ÄúI remember when Joe and I were talking about doing the record and he said that he had been trying to get people to record it ever since Randy Crawford first did it. It‚Äôs a great piece of music but it‚Äôs a tough song. After we recorded it, I told him that no one else took it because it was mine, it was meant for me! Now I can‚Äôt go anywhere without singing it.‚Äù The response to her latest album is such that Lalah considers the wait between albums to have been worth it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy about the reaction, it‚Äôs a real validation‚Äù and it comes towards the end of a year that has included a number of highpoints including her participation in the ‚ÄúDaughters Of Soul‚Äù European tour which was created by Sandra St. Victor and involved Lalah, Simone (daughter of Nina Simone), Milini Khan (Chaka's daughter), Nona Hendryx and Joyce Kennedy. ‚ÄùIt was awesome, truly inspiring and wonderful to be with all those women. The U.S. market can be hard sometimes and I‚Äôm hoping we can bring the show to U.S. audiences. Watching each of them from the wings was like being in a big master class!‚Äù Certainly, watching Lalah Hathaway perform is also like being in such a class: all the training she received at the prestigious Berklee School Of Music along with what she inherited from her father has made her a rare artist, one who combines musicianship and a natural instinct for what works with lyrical interpretation. While she is aware of her musical gift and her ability to move people with her work, Lalah sums up where she's at by simply saying, ‚ÄúI feel lucky and blessed and that I‚Äôm in the right space with my music and my life.‚Äù That sense of self-assurance is evident every time she hits the stage and on her latest album. If you want some real music and you haven't yet done so, we strongly recommend you purchase a copy of ‚ÄùOutrun The Sky‚Äù: it's an affirmation that we still have some true artists out here making music for the heart and soul!\\"Lalah Hathaway: There Are Some Voices 2004 Interview Soulmusic.com Retrieved: May 15, 2009 Track listing # \\"How Many Times\\" (Flowers) ‚Äî 3:39 # \\"Back Then\\" (Hathaway, Parks, Sessions) ‚Äî 4:49 # \\"Your Favorite Song\\" (Flowers) ‚Äî 4:07 # \\"Forever, For Always, For Love\\" (Vandross) ‚Äî 5:52 # \\"Better and Better\\" (Flowers) ‚Äî 4:04 # \\"Outrun the Sky\\" (Hathaway) ‚Äî 3:06 # \\"If U Ever\\" (Delhomme, Hathaway) ‚Äî 4:15 # \\"In the End\\" (Parks, Sessions) ‚Äî 3:48 # \\"Admit It\\" (Hathaway, Hutchinson, Parks, Sessions) ‚Äî 5:34 # \\"Stronger\\" (Delhomme, Hathaway) ‚Äî 5:47 # \\"We Were 2\\" (Delhomme, Hathaway) ‚Äî 8:10 # \\"More\\" (Delhomme, Hathaway) ‚Äî 5:10 # \\"Boston\\" (Hathaway) ‚Äî 5:37 References Category:2004 albums Category:Lalah Hathaway albums ","title":"Outrun the Sky"},{"id":"11792409","text":"Bohutyn is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Sosnowica, within Parczew County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.

This reddish orange salt is an important reagent for the preparation of other coordination complexes of platinum. It consists of potassium cations and the square planar dianion PtCl42‚àí. Related salts are also known including Na2PtCl4, which is brown-colored and soluble in alcohols, and quaternary ammonium salts, which are soluble in a broader range of organic solvents.  Preparation  Potassium tetrachloroplatinate is prepared by reduction of the corresponding hexachloroplatinate salt with hydrazine. K2PtCl4 is one of the salts that is most easily obtained from platinum ores. The complex is appreciably soluble only in water. Treatment with alcohols, especially in the presence of base, causes reduction to platinum metal. Organic tetrachloroplatinate salts, such as [PPN]2PtCl4 are soluble in chlorocarbons. Reactions The chloride ligands on [PtCl4]2‚àí are displaced by many other ligands. Upon reaction with triphenylphosphine, [PtCl4]2‚àí converts to cis- bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum chloride: :PtCl42‚àí \\\\+ 2 PPh3 ‚Üí cis- PtCl2(PPh3)2 \\\\+ 2 Cl‚àí The anti-cancer drug Cisplatin can similarly be prepared: :PtCl42‚àí \\\\+ 2 NH3 ‚Üí cis-PtCl2(NH3)2 \\\\+ 2 Cl‚àí Enedithiolates displace all four chloride ligands to give bis(dithiolene) complexes. Reduction gives colloidal platinum of potential interest for catalysis. Historically, an important reaction involves ammonia and [PtCl4]2‚àí. This reaction affords a deep green precipitate with empirical formula PtCl2(NH3)2. This material, known as Magnus' green salt, is a semiconducting coordination polymer consisting of chains of alternating [PtCl4]2‚àí and [Pt(NH3)4]2+ centres.

Recorded between 1976 and 1978, it was released in September 1979 by record label Piano.  Reception  In a contemporary review for NME, Andy Gill wrote: \\"For much of This Heat's album, it's difficult and at times impossible to decipher which instrument is playing what. This is some indication of their intentions, and the way This Heat set about realising those intentions.\\" Vivien Goldman, writing in Melody Maker, remarked that This Heat \\"takes you to ten movies in the space of a one-year-old album\\". NME listed it as the 35th best album of 1979.  Legacy  Retrospectively, Dean McFarlane of AllMusic wrote: \\"There are very few records that can be considered truly important, landmark works of art that produce blueprints for an entire genre. In the case of this album, it's clear that this seminal work was integral in shaping the genres of post-punk, avant rock and post-rock, and like all great influential albums, it seemed it had to wait two decades before its contents could truly be fathomed.\\" Peter Marsh of BBC Music called it \\"one of the strongest and strangest debut records of all time. Seemingly born out of the fervent experimentalism of the UK post-punk scene, This Heat's beautifully skewed mix of improvisation, lo-fi tapework and stretched, ghostly songform actually had more in common with maverick longhairs like Henry Cow and Faust. [...] The music here seethes with an economy, invention and power that still shocks a quarter of a century on.\\" Steven Grant of Trouser Press wrote: \\"Though insolent and withdrawn, the music is adventurous and, in its own peculiar way, engrossing.\\" Pitchfork included the song \\"24 Track Loop\\" on their list of the \\"Greatest 500 Songs from Punk to the Present\\".

Design and development The aircraft was designed by Ryszard Bartel in Samolot factory in Pozna≈Ñ, as an advanced trainer, transitory between primary trainers and bomber or reconnaissance aircraft. Bartel had worked since 1926 on his BM-3 advanced trainer design, the preliminary design for which won a military contest, but in the meantime he developed a quite successful primary trainer Bartel BM-4 and then decided to model the advanced trainer upon that plane, to obtain better durability. The result was the BM 5 design. The BM 5 prototype was built in 1928 and flown on 27 July that year in Pozna≈Ñ. It had good handling, high stability and spin resistance, which made it a suitable trainer for larger aircraft. A distinguishing feature of all Bartels was an upper wing of a shorter span, because lower and upper wing halves were interchangeable (i.e. the lower wingspan included the width of the fuselage). The first prototype was designated BM 5a and was fitted with a Austro-Daimler inline engine. The second prototype, flown on 15 April 1929, was designated BM 5b and was fitted with a SPA-6A inline engine, then was refitted in August with a Hispano-Suiza 8Fb V-engine and redesignated BM 5c (it was meant to utilize engine stores from the Bristol F.2 Fighter). Next 20 aircraft of each type were built: BM 5a, BM 5b and BM 5c. A disadvantage of most BM 5s were old and faulty engines. From all the variants the BM 5a variant was the heaviest and had the worst performance. For that reason in 1935 one BM 5 was fitted at the PZL works with a Wright Whirlwind J-5 radial engine, produced in Poland (in Polish Skoda Works, then Avia). This variant was designated the BM 5d and 20 of BM 5a and BM-5b were next converted to BM 5d. Operational history BM 5s were used in the Polish Air Force for training from 1930, in a central pilots' school in Dƒôblin. Five BM 5c's were used in Naval Air Unit (MDLot) in Puck, but most were written off in the second half of 1930s and replaced with the PWS-26. Some survived until the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, but none survived the war.

The Swedish Emigration Commission (), was a commission that existed between 1907 and 1913 that was mandated by the Swedish Riksdag to try to reduce Swedish emigration to the United States. In the 19th century, Sweden had had one of the highest rates of emigration to North America in all of Europe, the third highest after Ireland and Norway. By 1910, one fifth of all Swedes had their homes in America.1.4 million Swedish first and second generation immigrants lived in the US, while Sweden's population at the time was 5.5 million; see Beijbom, \\"Review.\\" The situation alarmed conservative Swedes, who regarded emigration as a challenge to national solidarity and to the very nation state itself, already seemingly under threat from trade unionism and the international socialist movement.Barton, 131. The liberal interest, which had in the 19th century favored emigration as a practical necessity, by now also saw it as a net drain, depriving Sweden of the labor necessary for economic development. Both camps shared a perception, disturbing in a Europe where the forces of war were gathering, that young, male Swedes were fleeing to America to escape military service.K√§lvemark, 111. The conservative and nationalist parties proposed dealing with the problem by restrictions, the liberal and Social Democrat parties by social and economic reform. Despite such ideological faultlines, it was with broad national consensus that a Parliamentary Emigration Commission was mandated to study the problem in 1907. Led by the liberal academic Gustav Sundb√§rg, the Commission went to work with \\"characteristic Swedish thoroughness\\",Barton, 149. and published its findings in 21 volumes of exhaustive data on social and economic conditions in Sweden and America, together with Sundb√§rg's analysis and proposals. As Sundb√§rg put it, to discuss the emigration meant to discuss Sweden in its entirety. The conservative parties proposed legal restrictions on emigration propaganda, emigrant agents, and emigration by military conscripts. In the end, all such authoritarian measures were dismissed by the Commission, which instead went with Sundb√§rg's goal of bringing the best sides of America to Sweden (unsurprisingly, as Sundb√§rg himself wrote the conclusions).K√§lvemark, 111, and Barton, 149. First on his list of urgent reforms were universal male suffrage, better housing, general economic development, and a broader popular education which could counteract \\"class and caste differences.\\"The phrase is from Ernst Beckman's original liberal parliamentary motion for instituting the Commission; quoted by Barton, 149. Class inequality in the hierarchic Swedish society was a strong theme in the findings of the Commission. It appeared as a major motivating force in the summarized case histories of outbound Swedish emigrants, interviewed in Hull and Liverpool, which were published in Volume VII. The motif was also typical of the personal documents--of greater human and research interest today--which were included in the same volume. Those were narratives submitted by anonymous Swedes in Canada and the US in response to solicitations by the Commission in Swedish-American newspapers. 289 of them were also published in Volume VII, with the individuals identified by initials, state of residence, and year of emigration. Barton warns that, statistically, the response to the Commission's newspaper appeal will be slanted towards individuals with particularly strong views; yet their experiences remain illuminating.Barton, 152. The great majority were enthusiastic over their new homeland, and critical of conditions in Sweden. They describe particularly the grim poverty in the Swedish countryside, the hard work, pitiful wages, and discouraging prospects. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her V√§rmland home parish, she had had to go out and earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work at four in the morning and living on \\"rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick.\\" She could see \\"no hope of saving anything in case of illness, but rather I could see the poorhouse waiting for me in the distance.\\" When she was seventeen, her emigrated brothers sent her a prepaid ticket to America, and \\"the hour of freedom struck.\\"Quoted from Volume VII of the Commission's findings by Barton, 152. The emigrants also strongly emphasized non-material considerations, such as the exclusion of the poor from the political process, through the restrictive Swedish franchise before 1907. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40-50 years in America. A man who'd emigrated in 1868 described the disparaging comments he had heard in his youth from the aristocrat in charge of the parish poor relief, which \\"gave rise to great bitterness and a large number, among them myself, emigrated to America, which I have never regretted. Here, you are treated like a human being, wherever you are.\\"Quoted by Barton, 153. A year after the Commission published its last volume, World War I broke out and reduced emigration to a mere trickle. There was a brief upswing after the war, but from the mid-1920s, there was no longer any Swedish mass emigration. Did the ambitious Emigration Commission have any part in solving the problem? Franklin D. Scott argued in an influential essay in 1965 that it had very little, and that the American Immigration Act of 1924 was the effective cause. Barton, by contrast, points to the rapid implementation of essentially all the Commission's recommendations, from industrialization to an array of social reforms, and maintains that its findings \\"must have had a powerful cumulative effect upon Sweden's leadership and broader public opinion.\\"Barton, 165.

It is the largest of the islands in King Charles Land (Kong Karls Land). Its area is . The other main island in the chain is Svensk√∏ya. Geography Kongs√∏ya is the largest island in Kong Karls Land, and has a length of about 40 kilometers. It is separated from Abel Island to the east-northeast by the seven nautical miles wide strait Lydiannasundet, and from Svensk√∏ya to the west-southeast by Rivalensundet (15 nautical miles wide). The strait of Erik Eriksenstretet separates Kongs√∏ya from Nordaustlandet. Kongs√∏ya has a long, narrow and bent shape, with a number of headlands and bays. At the southern side of Kongs√∏ya is the wide open bay Breibukta, with several islets and skerries. The islands of Helgoland Island and Tirpitz√∏ya are located south of Breibukta. Further east, between T√∏mmerneset and Bremodden, is the bay Andr√©ebukta, and on the northern side is Svenskebukta. Further east is the bay B√ºnsowbukta, between the headlands of Nordneset and Kapp Koburg. The bay of Vrakbukta, between Kapp Koburg and Kennedyneset, faces northwest. To the south is the bay Antarcticbukta and the headland Kapp Altmann. At the southern side of the island, northeast of Kapp Altmann, is the long beach Sn√∏sporvstranda. The western and eastern parts of Kongs√∏ya are highlands, while the central part consists of lower land. The highest mountain is Retziusfjellet at the western side of the island, with an altitude of 320 m.a.s.l. Johnsenberget, at the eastern part of the island, reaches the height of 235 meters. The interior of the eastern side contains the plain Rundisflya, named by the circular glaciated area Rundisen. Rundisflya has a height of 50 m.a.s.l. or higher. It contains several smaller lakes, the largest of which is Rundisdammen. Five smaller lakes, Koppelvatna, are located east of Johnsenberget. History Kong Karls Land was possibly observed by whaler Thomas Edge in 1617. It was rediscovered in 1853, reported by Erik Eriksen. Hunters killed about 100 polar bears during the winter of 1908-1909\\\\. Cabins were built at Nordaustpynten, Kapp Koburg and T√∏mmerneset. In 1971 the polar bear was fully protected from hunting. In 1985 the whole Kong Karls Land, including Kongs√∏ya, was totally protected against human traffic. Nature Kong Karls Land is regarded the most important hibernating area for polar bears in Svalbard. A density of 14 dens per square kilometer has been observed at Kongs√∏ya. Kongs√∏ya is included in the Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve, which was established in 1973. In 1985 strong regulations of human traffic on the island were introduced. The purpose is to avoid disturbance of the polar bear at its most important denning locations. It is generally forbidden to visit any of the islands of Kong Karls Land. This also includes the sea area within a distance of 500 meters from the shore, and air traffic lower than 500 meters. Exceptions from the prohibition are supervision activities from the authorities, and to a certain extent scientific exploration or other special purposes, if this does not violate the purpose of the regulations.

The aim of the organization was to end the South African colonial administration, and the placement of South West Africa under the United Nations Trusteeship system. Andimba Toivo ya Toivo had founded its predecessor, the Ovamboland People's Congress, in 1957 in Cape Town, South Africa.Andimba Herman Toivo Ya Toivo South African History Online, Accessed: 26 July 2017 In 1959, Sam Nujoma and Jacob Kuhangua established the Ovamboland People's Organization (OPO) at the Old Location in Windhoek.THE PERIOD OF SOUTH AFRICAN ADMINISTRATION History of SWAPODenis Herbstein and John Evenson. The Devils Are Among Us, 1989. Page 6. Sam Nujoma was the president of OPO until its transformation into the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) a year later and remained president until Namibia gained independence in 1990. History In 1949, Sam Nujoma moved from Walvis Bay, where he had been working, to the colonial capital of Windhoek. He immediately became involved in politics through which he met and formed a close relationship with his political mentor and Herero Chief Hosea Kutako. South West Africa Native Labour Association (SWANLA) recruited many Namibians through the controversial contract labour system to work on farms and mines in Namibia and South Africa. The contract labour system was met with objections for its harsh treatment and human rights abuses by Namibian nationalists both in the country and abroad. In 1951, Andimba Toivo ya Toivo moved to South Africa, where he worked as a railway police officer in Cape Town. Ya Toivo and others influenced by the politics of the African National Congress (ANC) met several times at a small barbershop in Cape Town to discuss Namibia's political situation and issues concerning the contract labour system. During the discussions on political action, the group formed the Ovamboland People's Congress (OPC) on August 2, 1957 under the leadership of Ya Toivo.Denis Herbstein and John Evenson. The Devils Are Among Us, 1989. Page 5. Among the founding members were Jacob Kuhangua, Mzee Kaukungwa, Eliaser Tuhadeleni, Peter Mweshihange, Solomon Mifima, Maxton Mutongulume, Jariretundu Kozonguizi, Emil Appolus, Andreas Shipanga, Ottili√® Schimming and Kenneth Abrahams. The group aim sought to end the exploitative contract labour system and policies of SWANLA. The information about the OPC's formation reached nationalist leaders inside the country. One of them was Sam Nujoma who became one of the organization's front man leading its Windhoek branch. Nujoma went around to the workers compounds talking to them about the formation of the new organization. By 1958, the organization had thousands of members and followers in compounds and locations all over Namibia.‚ÄúBreaking the wire‚Äù ‚Äì The struggle for freedom in Namibia Accessed: 25 July 2017 In 1958, Ya Toivo sent a letter and a tape he recorded to Mburumba Kerina and Rev. Michael Scott, who were based in the United States, documenting human rights violations in South West Africa. This information was used to petition the United Nations. In December 1958, Ya Toivo was expelled from Cape Town shortly after the petition made headlines in the New York Times and was deported together with Jacob Kuhangua and Jariretundu Kozonguizi among others. After spending a few days in Keetmanshoop and then Windhoek the police were determine to deport him further to Ovamboland, where he was placed under house arrest in the kraal of the Ondonga Chief Johannes Kambonde. On 19 April 1959, Sam Nujoma, Jacob Kuhangua, Louis Nelengani, Emil Appolus and Lucas Haleinge Nepela officially established the Ovamboland People's Organization (OPO) as the successor of the OPC at the Old Location in Windhoek.Denis Herbstein and John Evenson. The Devils Are Among Us, 1989. Page 6. At the first congress Nujoma was elected President, Nelengani Deputy President, Kuhangua Secretary General and Nepela as Chairperson. Ya Toivo was under house arrest during this time missing out on a position but he was deemed the organization's leader in Ovamboland. He would later become the Secretary of its Ondangwa branch where he played an important role in mobilizing new members and educated them about colonial resistance. During this time Nujoma and Ya Toivo had only communicated through letters, they have never met face to face until Ya Toivo was released from Robben Island in 1984. In September 1959, the South West African National Union (SWANU) was officially launched at a public meeting in Windhoek with the backing of the Herero Chief Council under the leadership of Chief Hosea Kutako. SWANU was established as an umbrella body for anti-colonial resistance groups to broaden and strengthen the nationalist basis of the movement. OPO became a member of SWANU and its leaders were members of SWANU's executive committee. Jariretundu Kozonguizi became the first president of SWANU after receiving strong support from OPO and the Herero Chief Council.The Chronology History of Namibia Klaus Dierks OPO together with SWANU were instrumental in organizing the Old Location Uprising protest after the colonial administration forcefully moved residents of the Old Location to a new township, Katutura. On December 10, 1959 the police opened fire during a protest and killed 11 protesters. OPO and SWANU leaders faced arrest and were interrogated. After this event the two groups had different views on the way forward which culminated in OPO breaking out of SWANU to pursue the arms struggle. Sam Nujoma continued to face arrest and threats of deportation to Ovamboland. On 26 February 1960, after receiving advice from Chief Hosea Kutako he escaped and went into exile.Peter N. Stearns and William Leonard Langer. The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged, 2001. Page 1070. Shortly after arriving in Tanzania, Nujoma left to the United States and join Mburumba Kerina and Jariretundu Kozonguizi to petition the United Nations. In New York, meetings between Nujoma, Kerina and Kozonguizi to unite OPO and SWANU in order to fight the common enemy as a united people were unsuccessful. Instead the idea to transform OPO into a pan- ethic national liberation movement with a mandate to unite all people of South West Africa was birthed. On 19 April 1960, the OPO leadership in Windhoek transformed OPO into the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).Dictionary of African historical biography \\"Sam Nujoma\\", Page 280, 1989 Nujoma was elected as SWAPO President in absentia and Kuhungua retained his position as Secretary General. Following the transformation in 1960 many SWAPO leaders arrived in Tanzania to prepare for the launch of the armed liberation struggle. In 1962, SWAPO founded its military wing, the South West Africa Liberation Army (SWALA), which was later renamed the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Ya Toivo, Eliaser Tuhadeleni and other SWAPO leaders were able to facilitate the logistics that led to the establishment of the military bases inside the country. On 26 August 1966, the South African Defence Force attacked SWAPO guerrilla fighters at Omugulugwombashe in northern Namibia. It was the first armed battle in the Namibian War of Independence which lasted until 1989. After the battle, about 63 SWAPO freedom fighters inside the country including Ya Toivo, Eliaser Tuhadeleni, John Otto Nankudhu, Immanuel Shifidi, Nathaniel Maxuilili and Helao Shityuwete were arrested at different occasions and air lifted to Pretoria to face trail. They were trailed under the Terrorism Act of 1967 majority of them were sentenced to prison on Robben Island and some dying in Police custody during the trail. Namibia achieved independence on 21 March 1990, SWAPO won the first democratic elections and Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia.

The station is on the east side of Highway 101 beneath East Grand Avenue; downtown South San Francisco is across the freeway. It is currently undergoing a substantial modernization and expansion project, scheduled to be completed in autumn 2020. History A depot for South San Francisco was built in 1909 shortly after the completion of the Bayshore Cutoff, with an entrance on Grand Avenue. Prior to that, a smaller station existed at least as early as 1898. The 1909 building was demolished in the late 1950s and replaced with a smaller building with an entrance off Dubuque. =Current status= A southbound train holds outside the station while passengers board a northbound train The station was built before the Bayshore Freeway and retains many of the aspects common to older, unmodernized stations along the Peninsula Commute; the platforms are not ADA- compliant, and riders for northbound trains must wait for the northbound train to come to a complete stop before crossing the southbound track to a narrow boarding platform between the tracks, thus requiring the so-called \\"hold-out\\" rule (GCOR 6.30)--if a train is stopped for passengers, an approaching train in the opposite direction on the other track must wait outside the station. In 2012, a southbound Baby Bullet express train passing through the station narrowly avoided striking passengers for a northbound train stopped at South San Francisco. The Baby Bullet express did not have a scheduled stop at the station and had ignored the hold-out rule. South San Francisco is the only hold-out rule station with regular service on weekdays - Atherton, Broadway and College Park have limited or no weekday service - making it a bottleneck for rail traffic. Automobiles can reach the station by turning from Grand Avenue north on Dubuque, just east of U.S. 101, and a pedestrian staircase climbs to Grand, above the station. Several SamTrans routes run near the station on Airport Boulevard, but steep ramps and tight turns make it impossible for large buses to access the station from Dubuque. The south end of the parking lot features a large mural on the retaining wall for Grand Avenue entitled \\"Prometheus Brings Fire to Man\\" by artist Nicolai Larsen, painted in 1996. =Modernization= The new platform under construction in July 2018 In 1998, the City of South San Francisco (SSF) prepared a concept plan to relocate the station southward so that trains would stop south of the East Grand Avenue overpass in order to improve bus and pedestrian access to the station. This would allow buses currently stopping on Airport Boulevard (west of Bayshore Freeway and the station) to directly service the station and open up access from the east for employer-provided shuttles. In 2012 Caltrain and SSF began work on a Downtown Station Area Plan to redevelop the area around the station and make it easier to reach downtown from the station. The project will update the station by renovating the southbound platform and extending it south, and building a new northbound platform to eliminate the \\"hold out\\" rule and to be ADA-compliant. The project will include a bus and shuttle drop-off area on Poletti Way and an ADA-compliant pedestrian underpass to the new platform that would connect with East Grand Avenue/Poletti Way (on the east) and Grand Avenue/Airport Boulevard (on the west). The west entrance will also feature a new pedestrian plaza at the southeast corner of Airport Boulevard and Grant Avenue, on right-of-way currently used as a Caltrans storage yard. A new pedestrian gate crossing at the northern end of the new platform will provide access to the existing parking lot. The plan was approved in February 2015 and will be funded by $49.1 million in funds provided by San Mateo County Measure A, a half-cent sales tax approved by county voters in 2012. Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board contributed $4 million and SSF contributed $9.2 million, including $3.3M to expand station property and remediate soil. The current plan calls for a new -long island platform (between northbound and southbound tracks) relocated south of the existing side platform with a pedestrian underpass connecting the platform to Grand Avenue and Poletti Drive (on the east) and Grand and Airport (on the west). Although construction was scheduled to begin in 2016, the design was not finalized until December 2016, and groundbreaking for the modernization project was held on November 6, 2017 in a ceremony attended by State Senator Jerry Hill and SSF Mayor Pradeep Gupta. The new station was projected to open in 2019, but was delayed to August 2020 after planned underground utility relocation work was determined to be a prerequisite for construction of the new pedestrian underpass.

She has been credited with being a defining early influence on the gay and lesbian club scene in Sydney's Oxford Street and Newtown. Early life Born circa 1928 in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, she won a bursary to St Vincent's College, Potts Point, run by the Sisters of Charity. She left school at age 15, and three years later, aged 18, won the Australian ladies speed skating championship, turned professional and taught at the Glaciarium before going to London and Paris. She was briefly married to a butcher named Des Irwin. Her career began as an international ice skater when she was a teenager. It was while touring Paris as a performer in the Puss in Boots on ice show, she had her first romance with another woman. Career After her promising skating career was cut short by injury, O'Donnell ran a butcher shop in Double Bay and a parking lot in Ultimo, before opening her first gay bar, The Trolley Bar, off Broadway in 1968. Next she opened a gay bath-house (above a cake shop in Bondi Junction, New South Wales), followed in 1969 by Capriccio's, a gay night club on Oxford Street famous for its drag shows, which drew visiting celebrities from around the world. She recognised the gay and lesbian potential of Oxford Street. At this time, homosexual acts between men were still illegal in New South Wales, and Dawn O'Donnell was known to pay bail to release gay men from police custody. Her gay and lesbian venues gave many \\"a place to come out\\". In 2001, O'Donnell recounted: \\"The most fascinating thing in the world for me was eventually to see the New South Wales Police Force have a gay public relations officer. I never thought to my dying day I'd ever see that.\\" Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, O'Donnell controlled a string of lesbian and gay venues in East Sydney, including: * Jools on Crown Street * Patchs nightclub on Oxford Street * Flo's Palace * The Exchange Hotel * Ruby Reds on Crown Street (Sydney's first lesbian bar) Some of these ventures were run in partnership with the late French restaurateur Roger Claude Teyssedre and controversial Sydney businessman Abe Saffron. The clubs attracted gays and lesbians from across Australia and around the world. During the 1980s, O'Donnell began to shift her focus from Oxford Street to the inner-west suburb of Newtown. She bought the Newtown and Imperial Hotels in nearby Erskineville, transforming the Newtown area into a gay precinct to rival Oxford Street. The Imperial Hotel featured in the opening scenes of the movie, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. According to Graeme Browning (a.k.a. \\"Mitzi Macintosh\\") who performed drag shows at O'Donnell-owned venues for 10 years, \\"She made the Sydney drag scene what it is, but our gay scene wouldn't be what it is without her either.\\" Another drag performer, David Williams (aka \\"Beatrice\\") said \\"she invented the idea of Oxford Street\\", helping to make Sydney one of the gay capitals of the world. Personal life and death In 1977, aged 49, O'Donnell met her long-term partner, Dutch-born Aniek Baten, who was 26 years old. They later married, both wearing white for the wedding.Dawn O'Donnell obituary, wordpress.com, 16 June 2007; accessed 24 March 2014. Their relationship continued until O'Donnell's death from ovarian cancer, aged 79, on Sunday, 10 June 2007.

Je≈º Jerzy, ≈öcigany, published in 2003 The comic strip first appeared as part of a children's magazine called ≈öwierszczyk. Originally, the strips were aimed at children with Jerzy the Hedgehog having adventures in a fairy tale land. In 1996, the strips were first published in the magazine ≈ölizg as an \\"adult version\\". The adult version of the comic strip was a satire on politics and modern Poland. The comic makes fun of groups like the police, ecologists, the subcultures of skinheads or dresiarze, or individuals, such as politicians (Andrzej Lepper and Grzegorz Ko≈Çodko). In the adult version, which has often been compared to South Park, the characters often swear, drink alcohol and take drugs. It is often violent and has scenes of nudity. Jer≈ºy has become a part of the skateboarding subculture. The adult version is still running on ≈ölizg and many versions of the adult comic books were published both in and outside of Poland. Characters * Je≈º Jerzy (George the Hedgehog), the main character, is a talking hedgehog and a skateboarder. He likes to drink, smoke marijuana and have sex with human females (in some stories they find him attractive; in others, repulsive). He loves his trusty skateboard. It seems that he has enemies everywhere, including the police and politicians. He often breaks the fourth wall. *Stefan and Zenek are two of Jerzy's enemies. They represent the far right skinhead subculture. They are racist and they hate everything they consider unpatriotic. *Zombie is a member of subculture called \\"dresiarze\\" who shot himself after Jerzy convinced him that he was gay. He later came back from the dead as a zombie to take revenge on the hedgehog. * El Dresso, often referred to as \\"Ma≈Çy\\" (Tiny), is a friend of Zombie who became a supervillain after his friend's death. In the Exorcist storyline, Zombie took over his body, as his own was destroyed. * Kula and friends are a trio of bullies from the dresiarze subculture who often try to beat up Jerzy. The leader's name is Kula. *The priest is an exorcist and a good friend of Jerzy. *Przemys≈Çaw R. is a serial killer who, after once failing to kill Jerzy, keeps coming back to seek revenge. In some ways, he is similar to Sideshow Bob from The Simpsons. *Pietia \\"the Scar\\" Pavlov is a Russian hitman, often seen in the second book and then return as center character in book six, as well appears in the final volume. *Yola is a very lusty girl who sometimes dates Jerzy. While a minor character in the comics, she plays a central part in the movie. *Micha≈Ç Puszka is a prison warden and friend of Jerzy. *The Authors themselves occasionally appear in the stories as Jerzy's parents (even though they are both male).

It is associated with a website and regular conferences, and produces materials such as DVDs on yoga and related subjects. The magazine has repeatedly won Western Publications Association's Maggie Awards for \\"Best Health and Fitness Magazine\\". Yoga Journal has been criticized for representing yoga as being intended for affluent white women; in 2019 it has attempted to remedy this by choosing a wider variety of yoga models. Beginnings Yoga Journal was started in May 1975 by the California Yoga Teachers Association (CYTA), which included William Staniger, Chairman (aka William Golden since 1982), Rama Jyoti Vernon, President, Janis Paulsen, Secretary/Treasurer, and board members Ike and Judith Lasater, Rose Garfinkle, and Jean Girardot. Staniger was the founding editor. Judith Lasater was Copy Editor, Paulsen, Elmer Brunsman, and Girardot were Assistant Editors, and Ike Lasater was Business and Advertising Director. Their goal was to combine \\"the essence of classical yoga with the latest understandings of modern science.\\" The journal grew from the CYTA's newsletter, which had been called The Word. Initially, the journal was staffed by volunteers, and contributors were unpaid. The first issue's 300 copies were personally distributed by the founders. Growth By the mid-1990s, as yoga's popularity in America grew, circulation for Yoga Journal reached 66,000. During these years, key figures at the magazine included Michael Glicksohn (as publisher), Stephen Bodian and Rick Fields (as editors-in-chief) and Linda Cogozzo (as longtime managing editor). In the fall of 1998, John Abbott, a former investment banker at Citicorp and a yoga practitioner, bought the magazine and brought in Kathryn Arnold as editor-in-chief. In January 2000, they redesigned and relaunched the magazine. Since their arrival, the paid circulation grew from 90,000 to 350,000 by 2010; the readership reached over 1,300,000. Yoga Journal has won major media awards including eight Western Publications Association's Maggie Awards for \\"Best Health and Fitness Magazine,\\" and the Award's top honor for \\"Best Overall Consumer Publication.\\" Forbes magazine has called the Yoga Journal website \\"the Web's most expansive and impressive Yoga site.\\" Coverage A display of Koundinyasana at the Yoga Journal Conference, 2011 Yoga Journal runs features on the themes of yoga, food and nutrition, fitness, wellness, and fashion and beauty. Early in the journal's history, in 1976, it published the guru Ram Dass's confession. The journalist Stefanie Syman calls its language that \\"of science and physiology, of diet and blood pressure\\". In her view, the journal uses \\"highly clinical-sounding language\\" even when covering \\"more mystical topics\\"; it stresses the use of yoga as therapy. Syman notes that the journal's coverage was \\"eclectic\\", especially noticeable in its calendar and classified advertisements. Yoga Journal's 2012 survey, Yoga in America found the yoga market to be worth more than $10 billion per year. The data, collected by the Harris Interactive Service Bureau (HISB), shows that 20.4 million people practice yoga in America. Yoga Journal has 12 international editions, published in Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand and Turkey. Criticism The social historian Sarah Schrank records that co-founder Judith Lasater \\"made waves\\" with her public criticism of the magazine in 2010; in Lasater's view, \\"photos of naked or half-naked women ... do not teach the viewer about yoga practice or themselves. They aren't even about the celebration of the beauty of the human body or the beauty of the poses [asanas], which I support. These ads are just about selling a product.\\" The journalist Rosalie Murphy, writing in The Atlantic in 2014, stated that Yoga Journal and similar yoga magazines are illustrated in \\"nearly every spread\\" with a thin woman, nearly always white; the image of yoga that is conveyed is, she argues, that yoga is intended for affluent white women. Murphy notes that the apparent stereotype is grounded in reality: in a 2012 study by Yoga Journal itself, over 80% of American practitioners of yoga were white. In January 2019, Yoga Journal exceptionally published two covers for the magazine, one showing a slim white woman, the other showing a larger black woman, both accompanied by a headline \\"The Leadership Issue\\", intended to examine the evolution of yoga and the part played by \\"lineage, social media, and power dynamics.\\" The pair of covers drew a strong response,For example: Reported on, for example, in: leading the journal's brand director, Tasha Eichenseher, to respond with an apology that \\"we caused harm\\" to \\"communities that have been disproportionately excluded from yoga\\", and an explanation that she was \\"working to make Yoga Journal more representative‚Äîregarding age, race, ability, body type, yoga style, gender, and experience.\\" References Sources * * Category:1975 establishments in California Category:Magazines established in 1975 Category:Magazines published in California Category:Magazines published in Colorado Category:Mass media in Boulder, Colorado Category:Sports magazines published in the United States Category:Yoga periodicals Category:Nine times annually magazines ","title":"Yoga Journal"},{"id":"11792865","text":"George Keathley may refer to: *George D.

More than 150,000 Soviet Jews immigrated during this period, motivated variously by religious or ideological aspiration, economic opportunity, and a desire to escape anti-Semitic discrimination. This wave of immigration was followed two decades later by a larger aliyah at the end of the Soviet Union. Background In 1967, the USSR broke diplomatic relations with Israel in the wake of the Six-Day War. During this time, popular discrimination against Soviet Jewry increased, led by an anti-Semitic propaganda campaign in the state-controlled mass media. By the end of the 1960s, Jewish cultural and religious life in the Soviet Union suffered from a strict policy of discrimination. This state-sponsored atheism persecution denied Jews the ethnic-cultural rights experienced by other Soviet ethnic groups.Decter, Moshe. The Status of the Jews in the Soviet Union. Foreign Affairs. January 1963. Emigration policy After the Dymshits‚ÄìKuznetsov hijacking affair in 1970 following the crackdown, international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to increase emigration quotas. Between 1960 and 1970, only 4,000 people had left the USSR. The number rose to 250,000 in the following decade.History of Dissident Movement in the USSR by Ludmila Alekseyeva. Vilnius, 1992 (in Russian) In 1972, the USSR imposed a so-called \\"diploma tax\\" on would-be emigrants who had received higher education in the USSR. The fee reached as high as twenty times an annual salary. This measure was designed to combat the brain drain caused by the growing emigration of Soviet Jews and other members of the intelligentsia to the West. Following international protests, the Kremlin soon revoked the tax, but continued to sporadically impose various limitations.\\"Declassified KGB Study Illuminates Early Years of Soviet Jewish Emigration\\", Sana Krasikov, December 12, 2007 Emigration Prior to the Six- Day War, few Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel. Israel's decisive victory changed the opinion of many Soviet Jews towards Israel. After the war, many Soviet Jews began to demand the right to move to Israel. However, given a choice, many Soviet Jews chose to emigrate to the United States.Lazin, Fred. Refugee Resettlement and 'Freedom of Choice': The Case of Soviet Jewry. Center for Immigration Studies. July 2005. Absorption of new immigrants in Israel 1972\\\\. A tearful reunion after 20 years between a brother and sister, who just arrived from Russia, at Lod Airport In 1968, 231 Jews were granted exit visas to Israel, followed by 3,033 in 1969. From that point on, the USSR began granting exit visas in growing numbers. During the late 1960s and the 1970s, some 163,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel; mostly between 1969 and 1973. While many Jews emigrated to Israel, others chose the United States instead. Known as \\"dropouts\\", the emigres applied for US refugee visas while waiting at transit centers in Austria and Italy. In March 1976, the \\"dropout rate\\" rose to over 50%. Most of the Soviet Jews who wanted to emigrate to Israel out of religious and/or ideological reasons had done so by 1973; from then on, most Soviet-Jewish emigrants were mostly motivated by economic concerns. Many were non-religious and saw themselves as Jews by nationality only, and thus they had little religious or ideological motivation to move to Israel, which they saw as having fewer opportunities than the United States. There were even thousands of non-Jews who used the opening to escape the Soviet Union. Most Soviet Jews who emigrated to Israel who had stronger Jewish identities came from the Baltic states, Moldova, and Georgia, while the \\"dropouts\\" were mainly assimilated Jews from the Russian heartland. Overall, between 1970 and 1988, some 291,000 Soviet Jews were granted exit visas, of whom 165,000 migrated to Israel, and 126,000 migrated to the United States.Tolts, Mark.

Biography Born in Chetumal (Mexico), Jos√© Javier Torres Maldonado studied violin and composition at the Mexico City Conservatory and later, invited by Franco Donatoni, composition at the ‚ÄúG. Verdi‚Äù Milan Conservatory, under the supervision of Sandro Gorli and Alessandro Solbiati; he completed his postgraduate studies under Franco Donatoni, Azio Corghi (Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Accademia Musicale Chigiana) and Ivan Fedele (Conservatoire de Strasbourg). In 2003, he earned a diploma from the G. Verdi Conservatory for his work in electronic music, and in 2004 he was one of ten composers asked to participate in the Stage de Composition et Informatique Musicale at the Parisian center IRCAM. In most of his works, Torres Maldonado explores innovative ways of organizing time, timbre and space. For example, in his piece for ensemble and electro- acoustic support, De Ignoto Cantu (2004), the composer presents several melody lines which, despite their complexity, actually derive from a single simple source consisting in a few number of elements; each line contains a considerable degree of horizontal-spectral consonance, but the vertical intervals and the variety of rhythmic accents in each line create a tough dissonance, both in harmony and rhythm, it is: he uses harmonic fields associated to layered pulsation patterns and metric modulation to create a sonic analog to the distorting process of reflection, ‚Äúalmost like a rotating lens through which the view goes in and out of focus‚Äù.Felici, C. (eng. translation by Boini, N.): \\"Exabrupto\\" -CD booklet-, page 14, Stradivarius recordings, 2005. About the triptych works Figuralmusik (1996‚Äì1998), the composer says: \\"it originates from the fascination that I have always felt for perceptive illusions, translated into impossible objects in physical reality, and, above all, for the results of the interlacing planes and perspectives used by Piranesi and M. C. Escher\\".Cit. of the composer by Bonomo, G.: \\"ESZ News\\", page 9. Edizioni Suvini Zerboni, 2000. Again contracting, expanding, intersecting and re-elaborating a limited number of fundamental musical figures, he expands the perception of musical objects through rapid or very slow juxtapositions of different temporal fluctuations. According to Beth E. Levy,Cit. Concert 31.1.2001, Program Notes by Beth E. Levy, San Francisco Contemporary Music Players. at times, Torres Maldonado exploit these complex compositional techniques to propose to the listener an openly social or political message; it is the case of one of his best known pieces, Exabrupto (1998), in which he uses complicated transitions in time and space, sudden breaks in the form and polymeters in a tribute to the memory of Mexican Indians who were assassinated in 1998 in Acteal, Chiapas. Torres Maldonado has received an international array of honors including the Commande d'Etat by the French Ministry of Culture (2007), the international composition prize of the GRAME (Centre National de Cr√©ation Musicale) of Lyon (2006), the ‚ÄúReine Elisabeth‚Äù of Brussels (2004), ‚ÄúAlfredo Casella‚Äù of Siena (2002), ‚ÄúReine Maria Jose\\" of Geneva (2000), ‚ÄúAd Referendum II‚Äù of Montreal (1998), \\"Citt√† di Barletta\\" (Italy), the ‚ÄúPrix des Musiciens‚Äù (1998) by the Nouvel Ensemble Moderne, the Medalla Mozart from the Austrian and Mexican governments, and he also won the second prize in two successive ‚ÄúMozart‚Äù Competitions in Salzburg (1999 and 2001). His works have been commissioned and programmed by internationally renowned festivals and institutions around the world, among which: the Mozart Week (Salzburg), Biennale of Venice, Festival Musica (Strasbourg), Biennale Musiques en Sc√®ne (Lyon), Settimana Musicale Senese, Gaudeamus Music Week (Amsterdam), Milano Musica Festival, Lucerne Festival, Focus!

In Soweto, South Africa, on June 16, 1976, about ten thousand black school children marched in a column more than half a mile long, protesting the poor quality of their education and demanding their right to be taught in their own language. Hundreds of young students were shot, the most famous of which being Hector Pieterson (see image). More than a hundred people were killed in the protests of the following two weeks, and more than a thousand were injured. On June 16 every year, governments, NGOs, international organisations and other stakeholders gather to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the full realization of the rights of children in Africa. For 2014, the theme chosen returns to the roots of the movement: A child- friendly, quality, free, and compulsory education for all children in Africa  See also  *African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child *Children's Day November 14 *International Mother Language Day  External links  * * BNF Youth League Commemorates Day of African Child by Arafat Khan, June 16, 2009 * June 16: International Day of the African Child by Adesoji Adegbulu, June 14, 2014 * International Day of the African Child updated Category:Protests Category:June observances ","title":"International Day of the African Child"},{"id":"11792994","text":"Franz Kaspar Hesselbach (January 27, 1759 ‚Äì July 24, 1816) was a German surgeon and anatomist who was a native of Hammelburg.

Symptoms  Symptoms appear as small circular red/orange lesions with distinct margins on the upper portion of the stalks, leaves and seeds. The lesions can measure 2mm-2cm and can contain dark brown fungal structures. Brown sunken areas can also appear on the stems.  Management  Partners of the CABI-led programme, Plantwise recommend several methods for preventing spread of C. sublineolum, these include; planting two weeks after onset of rains, planting resistant varieties/hybrids and using certified seed from known seed dealers. Crop rotation with other crops including soybean, groundnuts, cowpea and chickpeas can be used to prevent disease spread. The disease can also be controlled by removing or burying crop residues after harvest. It is also recommended by Plantwise partners, including the National Agriculture Research Organization in Uganda to remove alternate hosts such as Johnson grass and any volunteer sorghum plants in the field.

The male has black upper parts with a bluish sheen and yellow underparts, and is sometimes known simply as the yellow-bellied asity. It is found only in montane rainforests of Madagascar where it feeds on nectar that it sips from flowers, defending a good nectar source from other nectar-feeding birds. It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as \\"vulnerable\\" due to the diminution and fragmentation of its forest habitat. Description The plumage of male yellow-bellied sunbird-asities is very bright, with clean yellow undersides and dark black upper sides with an iridescent blue sheen; the females are duller. The eye is surrounded by a bright blue wattle which derives its colour, like the rest of the asities, from bundles of collagen. The bill is long and decurved, as it is adapted for nectar feeding. Behaviour This species is endemic to montane forest above 1600 m on the island of Madagascar. Yellow-bellied sunbird-asities are active nectar feeders. They will aggressively defend a nectar source from rivals of the same species as well as from sunbirds. The yellow-bellied sunbird-asity is listed as vulnerable by BirdLife International and the IUCN. It was once considered to be an endangered species, and even possibly extinct; however, this was due to a lack of ornithological surveys in its high-altitude range. Subsequent research has found it to be more abundant than previously suspected, although it is still considered threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation.

Albrecht (February 15, 1931 ‚Äì March 11, 2008) worked in college and professional sports for 53 years. He worked in the CFL, NFL and NCAA, and NASL. Background Albrecht was the son of wealthy New York businessman Herman Albrecht. Born in St. James, New York, Albrecht grew up in Long Island and Brooklyn and attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. He went on to attend Georgia Military College where he lost an eye in an accident. Because of this, he decided to pursue the closest thing to war, which to him at the time was football. =Name= Albrecht has claimed over the years that his initials have stood for nothing. However, in an interview with the Ottawa Sun he revealed that they stand for Just Incredible. When he was born, he said, there were complications which led the delivering doctor to fear that he or his mother would die at his birth, and asked his father who he wanted to live, the baby or the mother. His father said \\"both.\\" Both mother and son survived, and in commemoration the parents selected the unusual name. However, they were not allowed to use it on his birth certificate, and thus he went by his initials all his life. Early career Albrecht went on to work under General Robert Neyland whom he named his second son, Hunter Joseph Neyland after. At the University of Tennessee he won his first national championship. He then went on to recruit for several other NCAA teams and served for one season as the general manager of the Harlem Globetrotters. Albrecht then worked for the Denver Broncos, San Francisco 49ers, Oakland Raiders, and the New England Patriots of the NFL. In Canada he worked for the Montreal Alouettes where he got his first Grey Cup as part of the 1970 team. He was fired by Sam Berger in Montreal and went to work for the New England Patriots of the NFL. After a few years with the Patriots during the Grogan - Plunkett years he was hired by Bill Hodgson, owner of the Old Mill in Toronto and the Toronto Argonauts to serve as the team's general manager. After the Argos he went on to be the general manager of the Toronto Metros Croatia where he developed a love and respect for the game of soccer and the Croatian people. Montreal Alouettes Albrecht served as the general manager of the Montreal Alouettes during the 1970s and hired Marv Levy as head coach of the team. He guided the Alouettes to the Grey Cup championship in 1970, 1974, and 1977. He had a special love for the city of Montreal and his best friend, Herb Trawick, played for the Alouettes. Albrecht was named as the Montreal Alouettes all-time general manager for the 20th century in a fan vote. He brought many outstanding players to Montreal, many who were successful on the field, then as coaches and in business. Almost 40 years after their time in Montreal, many players still kept in touch with Albrecht. Players whom he recruited and signed include Wally Buono, Larry Smith, Junior Ah You, Gordon Judges, Steve Smear, Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers, Dan Yochum, & Ed George. Atlantic Schooners/Cape Breton In 1984 Albrecht was granted a conditional expansion team to play out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Schooners folded before they played a single game because Albrecht's ownership group could not secure the financing for a new stadium. His main investor, RB Cameron pulled out after being unable to secure government financing for the stadium. Albrecht had sunk several years into the project and fell in love with the city of Halifax, where he lived with his beloved dog Higgins, the English Bulldog who actually had his own article in the paper titled, \\"The World as Seen Through the Eyes of Higgins\\". He wrote in the paper, had a radio show, managed a radio station, and generally enjoyed life. It was in Halifax that he met his second wife Kathryn, who died of cancer a year after they separated. They moved together to Cape Breton where Albrecht took over the athletic director's job at the University College of Cape Breton where he launched the football program. The team started with just 21 players, where almost everyone played both ways. Albrecht brought in his lifelong friend George Brancato to coach the team. While at Cape Breton he brought in many players who went on to play professionally, such as George Nimako, Mark Pearce, and several others. Though the team was shelved after one year, won their last game of the season.  Ottawa Rough Riders and Shreveport Pirates  Albrecht was a consultant/personnel director to the Ottawa Rough Riders during the 1992 and 1993 seasons. He later became the Executive Vice President of Football Operations for the Shreveport Pirates. John Huard, one of Albrecht's best friends, and former 2nd round draft pick at Denver, was hired by him as the head coach for the Pirates' inaugural season in 1994. However Huard was fired by team President Lonie Glieberman before coaching a single game. Huard and Albrecht later sued the Pirates. Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver and the City of Shreveport also brought legal action against the team in separate suits.  Toronto Argonauts  Albrecht came back to the team in 2000 when he was hired to be managing director of the Argos by new owner Sherwood Schwarz, his first cousin. His brief term was controversial. Huard, who had been fired by the Shreveport Pirates six years earlier, became Albrecht's first choice as the new head coach of the Toronto Argonauts. His quirky, abrasive style did not endear himself to many, and he resigned from his post after a 1-6-1 record culminating with a 51-4 loss to the B.C. Lions. Despite all the disasters, Albrecht did hire player Michael Clemons as head coach. The decision came after several hours of discussion with Schwarz and his son, Dean Albrecht, where the two decided that they should have a young insider to take over the team as head coach. His son tabled the names Paul Masotti and Pinball Clemons. The elder Albrecht was emphatic about hiring Clemons, and the decision was made. Although Albrecht indicated he had been given a 10-year contract, he was fired after a single year. Later life Albrecht suffered a stroke in 2002 and spent the last year and a half of his life at a Toronto nursing home. After an article was written in both the Ottawa and Montreal papers, many of his old players publicly expressed their appreciation for what he had done for them in the past. He was working on his autobiography, entitled Just J.I: A Fisher Of Men and was seeking a publisher. Unfortunately, files he had been keeping for his autobiography were lost. On March 8, 2008, Albrecht died at a Toronto nursing home at the age of 77.

He is also a member of the hardcore punk band Off!, which formed in 2009, and the current bassist for the Melvins as of 2015. McDonald has appeared in numerous film projects with his older brother Jeff McDonald including: the 1984 film Desperate Teenage Lovedolls and its sequel Lovedolls Superstar; and the 1990 film Spirit of '76. Career Steven McDonald began his career in 1978, when he and his brother Jeff were 11 and 14 respectively. During those times, they lived in Hawthorne, California and were discovering underground music through Creem and Rock Scene magazines. Their real inspiration for the punk rock music began with Black Flag. Despite their age, The Flag added them to their member list. Soon after, they formed a band Redd Kross and performed their first show titled \\"Red Cross\\" at the eighth-grade graduation of one of their classmates. McDonald produced an album by The Format, Dog Problems, on which he played bass and sang backup vocals on a few tracks. He later produced, engineered, and mixed fun.'s debut album, Aim and Ignite, as well as performing as a bassist and backup vocalist on some of the songs. He was also one of the various band members on the original Tenacious D album, along with Dave Grohl; keyboardist Page McConnell of Phish; guitarist Warren Fitzgerald with band frontmen Jack Black and Kyle Gass. He appeared with Tenacious D on MADtv playing \\"Lee\\" and \\"Tribute\\". McDonald also featured briefly on bass in Kyle Gass' side-project Trainwreck in 2002 and 2003, under the pseudonym \\"Slim Watkins\\", before being succeeded by John Spiker. In the summer of 2002 he became so excited about The White Stripes' new album, White Blood Cells, that he recorded bass lines to two songs of the typically bass- less duo's work. The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly and other outlets reported on it and due to overwhelming demand he added bass to all of the songs, posted the new creation online, and allowed people to download the tracks for free. He called it an art project named Redd Blood Cells which reached a peak of 60,000 downloads in a single day, causing the server to crash from the traffic. In 2015, it was announced that McDonald would be joining the Melvins. He recorded four songs with the band, which were first released on the limited edition EP War Pussy and later included on the album Basses Loaded. Their first full release with McDonald, a double album titled A Walk with Love & Death, was released on July 7, 2017. McDonald co-wrote \\"Embrace the Rub\\" with his wife Anna Waronker of That Dog and Josh Klinghoffer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Personal life Steven is married to That Dog vocalist Anna Waronker.

Wright chaired the Scottish Constitutional Convention (1989‚Äì1999), which laid the groundwork for the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999.  Early life  Wright was born in Paisley in Scotland on 31 August 1932, the son of a textile technician. He attended Paisley Grammar School, followed by Glasgow and Cambridge Universities. Ministry From 1955, he served as a Methodist missionary in India and in 1963 was appointed Director of the Ecumenical, Social and Industrial Institute in Durgapur, India. In 1970, he returned to the United Kingdom as Director of Urban Ministry, at Coventry Cathedral and then in 1974 was promoted to Canon Residentiary at the Cathedral and Director of its International Ministry. In 1981, he came back to Scotland and became General Secretary of the Scottish Council of Churches. In 1990, he became Director of Kairos (Centre for a Sustainable Society). In 1994 he took up the post of Priest-in-Charge of All Saints Church in Glencarse.  Campaigning for a Scottish Parliament  Wright was a long-time campaigner for Scottish devolution. He had been a member of the Labour party but let this lapse to be able to work as part of the cross-party Scottish Constitutional Convention. He became the executive chairman of the convention and opened the first meeting on 30 March 1989. The convention was aimed at drawing up a blueprint for Scottish devolution and included representatives of local government, the Scottish Churches, Trade Unions, Small Business Federation and the Scottish Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green parties. The Scottish Conservative Party and Scottish National Party declined to be involved. The task of finding a consensus among the participating groups remained formidable, the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland, Malcolm Rifkind was reported as saying \\"if the disparate parties reached a common conclusion he would jump off the roof of the Scottish Office\\".T.M. Devine The Scottish Nation 1700‚Äì2000 Penguin 1999 p612 Nevertheless, on St Andrew's Day 1990, the convention delivered its first report recommending a legislature elected by proportional representation financed by assigned revenues from taxes raised in Scotland. Of course, any agreement which was rejected by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher could not become law. Wright responded to this political reality by appealing to the idea of Scottish popular sovereignty. At the first meeting of the Convention he famously remarked: \\"What if that other voice we all know so well responds by saying, 'We say no, and we are the state',? Well we say yes ‚Äì and we are the people.\\"The Claim of Right of 1988 alba.org.uk (accessed 16 June 2007) In 1997, when the Labour party came to power in the United Kingdom, the convention formed the basis of the Scotland Act that the Secretary of State for Scotland Donald Dewar successfully steered through the Westminster Parliament. However, the Labour Party also insisted on a referendum before the Scottish Parliament came into being. During this 1997 referendum, Wright was a prominent campaigner for the \\"yes/yes\\" vote. After the convention At the first election to the Parliament in 1999 he stood as an independent candidate in the West of Scotland region but was not successful. He joined the Scottish Liberal Democrats in 2000, having stayed out of party politics as chairman of the convention. In 2001 he stood as a candidate in the Banff and Buchan by- election for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, unsuccessfully contesting the Scottish Parliamentary seat vacated by the resignation of Alex Salmond. In the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary Elections, he contested the Stirling constituency. Wright also backed calls for a Devolved English parliament.Fresh call for English Parliament bbc.co.uk Tuesday, 24 October 2006 (accessed 16 June 2006) In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum he supported a Yes vote. Published works  Later life and death In 2008 Wright retired from working as a priest and returned to live in the Midlands.

He was born 5 April 1736 in Toulouse, France, the son of Philippe Dejean and Jeanne de Rocques de Carbouere. His father was a legal officer, and may have given his son legal training. DeJean was living in North American by 1761, and was a merchant in Detroit by 1766. By that time, the Seven Years' War between Great Britain and France was over, and DeJean was under the jurisdiction of Great Britain. He was appointed Justice of the Peace in April 1767. As the town surrounding Fort Detroit grew, DeJean's powers expanded, and he was soon appointed as Judge. The American Revolution created a crisis situation in which DeJean's authority as Judge and Henry Hamilton's authority as Lt-Governor went unchecked. Notably, in 1777 he executed Ann Wyley and a male accomplice for mere theft, in order to set an example to others. DeJean's reputation as a harsh judge who sometimes overstepped legal bounds was noticed beyond Detroit. Governor Guy Carleton criticized both DeJean and Hamilton for unjust and illegal acts, and they were both indicted in Montreal for \\"being tyrannical and acting illegally\\" Hamilton left Detroit on an expedition to recapture Post Vincennes, South of Detroit along the Wabash River, which had recently declared its support for the Americans. DeJean, perhaps aware of his precarious legal position without the support of Hamilton, accompanied a convoy of reinforcements. Hamilton was captured at Fort Sackville by Colonel George Rogers Clark, and DeJean- along with some papers he neglected to destroy- was captured on the Wabash by Captain Leonard Helm. DeJean was held as a prisoner in Williamsburg for four months, after which time he was paroled because he was considered sympathetic to the American cause. He returned to Vincennes, but did not return to Detroit for fear of prosecution for his abuses of power. His family, however, was not permitted to leave Detroit, and it appears that DeJean finally returned by late 1780. Detroit court records from July 1790 indicate that he lived outside British dominions. Various records indicate that DeJean may have returned to France for a time, and/or may have relocated to Vincennes. An 1807 census of Vincennes lists Philip Dejean, Male over 21. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography lists his death in or after 1809, when documents cease to list his name.

It was first mentioned in 1226, making it one of the oldest castles in South Holland. The castle is remarkable in that it has never been sold, which can be said of very few Dutch castles. It has passed by inheritance through several noble houses, sometimes through the matrilineal line. For the first five centuries of its history, the castle was owned by one family, the van Duivenvoordes, who gave their name - at that time, van Duvenvoirde - to it. Although thus named, the van Duvenvoirdes properly formed part of the House of Wassenaer, an ancient noble family which has played an important role in Dutch history. Towards the end of the 17th century an owner of Duivenvoorde Castle, Johan van Duvenvoirde, readopted the name of van Wassenaer. Therefore, although the same family remained in the House, this was under a different name.  The Roman plaques  In 1717, two Roman stones were installed as plaques in the front hall. The larger of the two stones, dated between 196 and 198 AD, has an inscription on the front about the repair of an armory by Roman troops; the text on the other side is older, dating from somewhere between 103 and 111 AD. In the making of the newer text, the stone was made smaller, damaging the older text. The smaller stone has a text which, through knowledge of the people named there in, can date the stone to around 205 AD. Legend holds that both stones come from Brittenburg, the presumed Roman ruins that resurfaced above water off the coast of Katwijk in 1520. However, this cannot be true of the larger stone, because a military chronicle discovered in 1517 was indisputably taken from the text inscribed on it, implying that the stone was one found in 1502 while plowing a piece of land near the Monastery of Roomburg.  Current status  The last private owner of the castle was Jonkvrouwe Ludolphine Henriette, Baroness Schimmelpenninck van der Oye (1891-1965). Knowing that with her death the house would be sold and the furniture dispersed, including the collections of portraits, porcelain and clothing and textiles, she decided to close the house and leave it in the care of a foundation for restoration. The stated aim was to restore the castle to its appearance in 1717, although in practice this has not always been possible. The terrace constructed around 1844 has been kept, and the opening of previously sealed windows to allow more light into the living room has taken away some symmetry. The interior has been redecorated to match the colours of 1717, and later stucco on the ceilings has been left in place. The Duivenvoorde Foundation aims to turn Kasteel Duivenvoorde into a museum and to put its historic contents on display to visitors. However, the central and north wings of the house have not been turned into the usual kind of museum and instead have been made to look as though they are still lived in, giving the visitor the impression of going back in time and walking around a house from which its 18th-century owners are only temporarily absent. The south wing is still inhabited; Ludolphine Emilie van Haersma Buma, Baroness Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, has lived there since 2003. Her brother lives in the castle's garden house.

It causes one of the most destructive diseases of tomatoes and attacks tomatoes during any stage of development.Douglas, S. M. (2008, June) \\"Septoria Leaf Spot on Tomato\\".Missouri Botanical Garden (2017) \\"Septoria Leaf Spot on Tomato\\".  Host and symptoms  Septoria lycopersici infects the tomato leaves via the stomata and also by direct penetration of epidermal cells.Martin-Hernandez, A. M., Dufresne, M., Hugouvieux, V., Melton, R., & Osbourn, A. (2000). \\"Effects of targeted replacement of the tomatinase gene on the interaction of Septoria lycopersici with tomato plants\\". Molecular plant-microbe interactions, 13(12), 1301-1311. Symptoms generally include circular or angular lesions most commonly found on the older, lower leaves of the plant. The lesions are generally 2-5mm in diameter and have a greyish center with brown margins.Elmer, W. H., & Ferrandino, F. J. (1995). \\"Influence of spore density, leaf age, temperature, and dew periods on septoria leaf spot of tomato\\". Plant disease, 79(3), 287-290.University of Illinois Extension (2017) \\"Septoria Leaf Spot of Tomato, Septoria lycopersici\\". The lesions are distinct characteristics of S. lycopersici and contain pycnidia in the center which aid when trying to identify the pathogen. Pycnidia can be found in the center of the said lesions. Pycnidia are fruiting bodies of the fungus. When the lesions become numerous often the leaves turn yellow, then brown, shriveling up and eventually dropping off the plant altogether.  Environment  Septoria lycopersici prefers warm, wet, and humid conditions. Disease development occurs within a wide range of temperatures however, the optimal temperatures lie between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius. High humidity and leaf wetness are also ideal for disease development. The initial source of inoculum for S. lycopersici results from overwintered resting structures such as mycelium and conidia within pycnidia which can be found on and in infected seed and within infected tomato debris left in the field.Agrios, G. N. (2005). Plant pathology (5th ed.). London: Elsevier Acad. Press. Spores spread to healthy tomato leaves by windblown water, splashing rain, irrigation, mechanical transmission, and through the activities of insects such as beetles, tomato worms, and aphids. Provided the environment is conducive for disease development, lesions usually develop within 5 days of infection.  Management  The effects of Septoria lycopersici can often be reduced through the implementation of a variety of management techniques. First and foremost, each season should begin as pathogen-free as possible. This can be accomplished by burning or destroying all infected plant tissues to prevent the spread of the primary innoculum. Crop rotation is also encouraged to avoid the re-infection of new foliage from overwintered inoculum. Improving air circulation around the plants through separation of rows and use of cages can also promote faster drying and reduction of splashing, thus reducing the spread of fungal spores. Drip irrigation and mulching also help with the reduction of splashing thus decreasing further inoculum dispersal. Fungicidal sprays should also be considered, though they do not cure already infected leaves, they protect uninfected leaves from becoming infected.

History Magpie was laid down as YMS-400 by Henry B. Nevins, Inc., City Island, New York, New York, 3 July 1942; launched 24 March 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Marie Norby; and commissioned 15 May 1943, Lt. Alan G. Lynn, USNR, in command. The new auxiliary motor minesweeper departed Staten Island for Norfolk, Virginia, 1 June, via the Chesapeake Bay; served briefly at Yorktown, Virginia; and escorted three merchant ships from Norfolk to Miami, Florida, arriving 27 June. She continued on to Key West, Florida, arriving the 30th. YMS-400 reported to the Caribbean Sea frontier 2 July and the next day escorted a convoy to Cuba, arriving Guant√°namo Bay the 6th. She spent the next 2 years on escort and patrol duties in the Caribbean out of Cura√ßao, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad. After the German surrender, YMS-400 with other YMS ships stationed at Section Base, Trinidad, BWI spent the spring and early summer of 1945 sweeping both ends of The Gulf of Paria (Venezuela/Trinidad) to recover and destroy moored mines which the United States had positioned to protect the Bay so that large naval vessels could exercise during shakedown cruises. After dry docking the ship left Trinidad in September 1945. passing through but not sweeping at the Panama Canal. Instead, heading a small convoy, YMS-400 sailed along the west coast of Central America to Newport Beach, California where it was refurbished at a private ship yard catering to wooden bottom boats. The next trip started in late fall. This voyage via convoy took the ship to Hawaii where the minesweeper was again inspected and tuned before leaving via the Marshall atolls for Guam and subsequently, Leyte Gulf in the Philippines. While in the Philippines, YMS-400 swept several shallow bays in Ragay Gulf on Luzon and near Diplog on Mindanao. Following the Japanese surrender, the auxiliary motor minesweeper arrived at the Panama Canal Zone 10 September 1945 for 6 months of minesweeping. In early April 1946, YMS-400 joined all the ships in Leyte Gulf in leaving harbor for open seas in order to ride out a tsunami caused by the 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake. YMS-400 was named USS Magpie and reclassified AMS-25 on 17 February 1947. For the next 3 years, based at Guam, she continued sweeping duties interspersed with practice exercises in the Marshall, Caroline, and Palau Islands. Magpie was operating out of Apra Harbor, Guam, at the outset of the Korean War. With hostilities in full fire, Magpie began minesweeping duty off Korea in September. On 1 October, while operating off the east coast of Korea with sister ship , Magpie struck a floating mine off Chusan Po, and sank. Twenty one of her crew including the commanding officer, Lt. (jg.) Warren R. Person were never found. Merganser picked up the 12 survivors and transported them to Pusan. Magpie was decommissioned 20 October 1950. Ensign Robert W. Langwell was one of the 20 crew members missing from Magpie. His remains were discovered in 2008 by South Korean military personnel and returned to the United States. Langwell's remains were interred at Arlington National Cemetery on 12 July 2010.  Awards and honors  Magpie received one battle star for Korean service.

He was England's first national coach from 1969 until 1971, finishing with a record of three wins and a draw from 11 matches. He was educated at Wellingborough Grammar School and at the age of 17 made his debut for Northampton, playing at prop. He made his Test debut for England in 1947 against Wales as flanker. He played 13 more matches for England, his last in 1953. White became Northampton's captain in 1954 and continued in the role until he retired from rugby in 1961 at the age of 35. He had represented his club 448 times. In 1964 he became managing director and chairman of his family's shoe business, which received a Queen's award for export achievement in 1990. Playing career White made his first-class debut when he played for Northampton against Coventry in 1943. He was only 17 at the time and attending Wellingborough Grammar School. He had been recommended to the Northampton team by his history teacher. White said of his debut - where he played at prop - \\"I thought I'd get a fearful hiding, but I emerged unscathed.\\" White continued to play for Northampton, and eventually switched from playing prop to flanker. In 1945 White made his first appearance against a touring side when Northampton played New Zealand Services; Northampton lost 11-6. In 1947 he was selected to make his international debut for England against Wales. He collected a cross-field kick to score a try to help England win 9-3. He played for England until 1953, and made a total of 14 appearances. He also played for a Leicestershire and Midlands Combined XV that played Australia in 1947. He also led Midlands against South Africa in 1951. He led East Midlands annually against the Barbarians, and also won the counties championship with them in 1951. He also led East Midlands to the county championship final defeats in 1950 and 1953. He again played the Australians in 1957, this time leading a Leicestershire/East Midlands side to an 18-3 defeat. His most famous counties match was when he scored Leicestershire and East Midlands' only try in a 3-3 draw with the 1960 Springboks (South Africa). He continued to play for Northampton until his retirement in 1961, and took over as captain from 1954, and when retired had represented the club 448 times. He had scored 116 tries, 71 penalties, 183 conversions and a drop goal - totaling 930 points. He was inducted into the Northampton Saints' Hall of Fame in 2005. Coach and administrator White was appointed as England's first-ever coach in 1969. According to former Northampton player Bob Taylor, \\"Don was chosen because he was the most forward-thinking coach in England\\". His first match in charge was an 11-8 victory over South Africa at Twickenham in 1969. Of the eleven games England played with White in charge they won three, and drew one and lost seven. He resigned as England coach in 1971, and joined Northampton's committee. He was appointed the club's honorary president for their centenary season of 1979/1980. He continued to serve on the club's committee until he was ousted in 1988. Personal and professional life After finishing his schooling at Wellingborough Grammar School, White started working for his family's shoe business White & Co in Earls Barton. He continued working at the family business and in 1964 was appointed as its managing director and chairman. In 1990 he received the Queen's award for export achievement. He continued as the managing director and chairman until his retirement in 1996. White was also the well respected President of Northampton Old Scouts RFC up until his death.

The EU is the world's largest economic union, customs union and donor of humanitarian and development assistance and thus has an extensive network of delegations around the world mainly operating in the framework of External Relations, for which the European Commission is the main decision body. The EU also represents shared political and security viewpoints held by its member states, as articulated in the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EU's predecessor, the European Coal and Steel Community, opened its first mission in London in 1955, after three years non-EU countries began to accredit their missions in Brussels to the Community. The US had been a fervent supporter of the ECSC's efforts from the beginning, and Secretary of State Dean Acheson sent Jean Monnet a dispatch in the name of President Truman confirming full US diplomatic recognition of the ECSC. A US ambassador to the ECSC was accredited soon thereafter, and he headed the second overseas mission to establish diplomatic relations with the Community institutions.Taking Europe to the world: 50 years of the European Commission's External Service The number of delegates began to rise in the 1960s following the merging of the executive institutions of the three European Communities into a single Commission. Until recently some states had reservations accepting that EU delegations held the full status of a diplomatic mission. Article 20 of the Maastricht Treaty requires the Delegations and the Member States‚Äô diplomatic missions to \\"co-operate in ensuring that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council are complied with and implemented\\". Management of the EU External Relations is conducted by the European External Action Service which reports to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. Delegates are generally sent only to capital cities and cities hosting multilateral bodies. The EU missions work separately from the work of the missions of its member states, however in some circumstances it may share resources and facilities. In Abuja, the EU mission shares its premises with a number of member states.Unified External Service of the European Commission Unified External Service of the European Commission The European Commission also maintains representation in each of the member states.

She was built in 1989 for the Soviet Union in Finland, at the Helsinki Shipyard by W√§rtsil√§ Marine, by order of the Murmansk Shipping Company. Her sister ship is Vaygach. Design =General characteristics= Indiga near the port of Dudinka. While Taymyr is slightly smaller than the Arktika-class nuclear icebreakers, with an overall length of nearly and beam of she is still among the largest polar icebreakers ever built. At the maximum draught of , Taymyr has a displacement of 21,000 tons. However, she can also operate at a reduced draught of only . Taymyr has a traditional icebreaker hull with highly raked stem and sloping sides to reduce the ice loads in compressive ice fields and improve maneuverability. The special cold-resistant steel used in the hull was delivered by the Soviet Union. Although designed for a crew of slightly over 100, the large superstructure of Taymyr contains accommodation and facilities for 138 personnel. In addition to messes and other social premises, there is a large auditorium that doubles as a recreational room and a winter garden that can be used to provide fresh vegetables for the crew during the polar night. In the aft, there is a helideck and a hangar for single Kamov Ka-32 helicopter. Being an escort icebreaker, Taymyr is equipped with a standard towing winch and a stern notch for close towing in difficult conditions. Taymyr is classified by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping with the Russian ice class LL2, which means that she is intended for icebreaking operations on Arctic coastal routes in level ice up to thick during winter and spring.. The shallow draught of the icebreaker allows it to operate in rivers, estuaries and other locations where the water is not deep enough for bigger Arktika-class icebreakers and the ice conditions are so severe that refueling of diesel-powered icebreakers would be difficult, even impossible. When the Taymyr-class icebreakers were designed, considerable effort was put into improving the safety of these nuclear-powered ships. The vessels were designed to operate in areas where there might be only of water beneath the keel, less than the thickness of the ice floes the icebreaking bow is pushing under the ship. The scenarios used for structural dimensioning of the reactor compartment and shielding included a 25,000-ton SA-15 class freighter striking the icebreaker amidships at . Furthermore, all critical systems are duplicated to improve reliability and allow the ship to maintain most of its operational capability after a collision. =Power and propulsion= Taymyr is powered by a single KLT-40M nuclear fission reactor located amidships with a thermal output of 171 MW. The nuclear power plant on board the icebreaker produces superheated steam, which is used to generate electricity for the propulsion motors and other shipboard consumers as well as heat to maintain operational capability at . Taymyr has two main turbogenerators aft of the reactor compartment consisting of Soviet-made steam turbines coupled to Siemens generators, each producing 18,400 kW of electricity at 3,000 rpm for the propulsion motors. In addition the ship has two auxiliary turbogenerators, manufactured in the Soviet Union, which produce 2,000 kW of electrical power for shipboard consumers.. Taymyr has a nuclear- turbo-electric powertrain, in which steam produced by the nuclear reactor is converted first into electricity, which in turn rotates the propulsion motors coupled to the propellers. The ship has three shafts with Str√∂mberg AC motors controlled by cycloconverters. The propulsion motors are coupled directly to four-bladed fixed pitch propellers rotating at 180 rpm. The ship can maintain a speed of in open water and in level ice. If the nuclear power can not be utilized, electricity can also be produced by three 16-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 16V22 medium-speed diesel engines coupled to 3,200 kVA Str√∂mberg alternators. Two of the three generating sets, located ahead of the reactor compartment under the superstructure, can be used to provide approximately 4 MW of power for the propulsion motors while the third takes care of the auxiliary load. In case of emergency Vaygach also has two 200 kW emergency diesel generators of Soviet origin. Taymyr and her sister ship are one of the last icebreakers equipped with W√§rtsil√§ Air Bubbling System (WABS). When pressurized air released from nozzles located below the waterline, it lubricates the hull and, by reducing friction between steel and ice, improves the ship's ability to operate in difficult ice conditions such as pressure ridges and reduces the risk of becoming stuck in ice. Radioactivity release In the spring of 2011 a minor release of radioactivity was detected in the ships reactor ventilation system. ‚Äì the second such leak on board the vessel in as many years. Taymyr returned to Murmansk under diesel power for repair. By then 6,000 litres of coolant had leaked from its nuclear reactor..

The symptoms for Armillaria spp. can vary greatly because of the wide host range and different species of pathogen. The hosts of Armillaria fuscipes specifically are tropical members of the genus Pinus, Camellia sinensis (tea), and members of the genus Coffea.Mwenje, E.; Wingfield, B. D.; Coetzee, M. P.

Retrieved 2019-11-12. The mycelium of A. fuscipes are bioluminescent and the rhizomorph is used to transfer nutrients over large distances to create fruiting bodies as well as infect other trees. The fruiting bodies are brown and white mushrooms that emerge from the base of the tree. The cracking of bark and resin leaking from the base of the tree are other symptoms seen mostly in the Pinus hosts. Importance Armillaria root rot caused by this A. fuscipes can result in the death of many Pinus species native to South Africa. The disease can spread from one tree to many and result in patches of dead trees of a considerable area. A. fuscipes is the major cause of armillaria root rot on tea in Kenya and has been found in other African countries. This has major economic implications for the tea industry in countries where the pathogen is prevalent, especially because of its wide distribution in Africa ranging from South Africa to as far north as Ethiopia. Kenya is the largest producer of tea in Africa, which accounts for 17-20% of the revenue made from exports.Wageningen (02/11/2002). [https://edepot.wur.nl/199036 \\"Armillaria root rot of tea in Kenya - characterization of the pathogen and approaches to disease management\\" The way the disease spreads and symptoms, which greatly affect yield, make it an important disease to control, primarily in places where the plants it affects are of economic importance. A. fuscipes can infect coffee plants as well, but it mostly affects stands of tea. Management Managing A. fuscipes can be difficult because removing the pathogen via the application of fungicides isn‚Äôt very straight forward. While fumigation of the plants is an option for control, it isn‚Äôt often used because many fumigants, such as methyl bromide, are banned due to their extreme toxicity and the adverse effects they have on the environment. Another option for controlling inoculum is mechanical removal of infected stumps and plant material. It is difficult to completely eradicate the pathogen in this manner and it is invasive, expensive and labor intensive. Some newer and more promising methods of management include solarization of the soil and the application of Trichoderma harzianum to the soil as a biological control. In a german study, it was found that solarization for 10 weeks increased the soil temperature enough that the viability of the pathogen was almost completely eliminated. The application of T. harzianum was effective in controlling A. fuscipes in woody species, and when combined with 5 weeks of solarization, caused a total loss of pathogen viability. Breeding for resistance and increasing host vigor are also options for long term management of this pathogen.

Born free in New York City, he moved as a child with his family to Charleston, South Carolina. His father died when he was young, and he and his mother also lived in Florida and Georgia. After escaping to the Cherokee, with whom he lived for two years, he allied with the British during the American Revolutionary War and resettled afterward in London. There he became involved with the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion and ordained as a preacher. Marrant was supported to travel in 1785 as a preacher and missionary to Nova Scotia, where he founded a Methodist church in Birchtown. He married there before settling in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1790 he returned to London. He wrote a memoir about his life, published in 1785 in London as A Narrative of the Lord's Wonderful Dealings with John Marrant, a black; also published were a 1789 sermon, and a journal in 1790 covering the previous five years of his life. Early life View of New York Harbor, c. 1770 Marrant was born free in New York City on June 15, 1755, the second youngest child in his family; he had two older sisters and an older brother, and a younger sister. Their father died in 1759 when Marrant was four. Rainbow Row's 13 houses along East Bay Street formed the commercial center of the town in the colonial period. His mother moved the family to St. Augustine, Florida, where Marrant started school, which was unique for black children. After 18 months in Florida and during the Seven Years' War, Marrant's mother moved the family to Georgia, which was a British colony at that time. He continued in school until the age of 11, learning to read and write. (His mother remarried at some time, and an older sister married in Charleston.) After they moved to Charleston, South Carolina, Marrant became interested in music and learned to play the French horn and violin. He frequently entertained the local gentry at balls and social gatherings. He studied music for a year and a half or two years and then he was an apprentice carpenter for more than one year. Religious journey George Whitefield preaching, engraving made in 1857. At the age of 13, about 1768, Marrant and a friend went to hear Methodist preacher George Whitefield, who was active in the South during the Great Awakening. He experienced a dramatic conversion, falling to the floor in a faint or illness. Unable to move or speak for half an hour, he was carried from the meeting to his home. Doctors were called, but he refused medicine. He got better by studying the Bible, but his steadfastness to Biblical study was troubling to his family. It was about this time that his family became concerned about some bizarre behavior by Marrant. They treated him as if he was mentally unstable. After disagreements with his family about religion, he left home, and wandered into a forest outside the city, relying on God to feed and protect him. He was found by a Cherokee hunter who knew his family but whom he persuaded not to take him back to town. Marrant traveled and hunted with the Cherokee for more than two months to gather furs for trade. They went to the man's fortified Cherokee town, where Marrant was stopped from entry. Told he did not have sufficient reason to be there, he was sentenced to death. Marrant's prayers to Jesus appeared to convert the executioner, who argued with the sentencing judge and arranged for Marrant to meet the king, who spared his life. They all heard him pray in English and Cherokee. Three Cherokee, 1762 Marrant lived with the Cherokee for two years during which he had visited with other tribes of the area, including Catawa, Housaw, and Creek people. He converted a number of Native Americans and is thought to have been an influence in creating lasting bonds between black and Cherokee people. He wore Native American style clothing made of animal skins. He had no pants, but wore a sash around his middle, and a long pendant that went down his back. When he returned to Charleston, his family did not initially recognize him. Marrant was deeply relieved when his sister recognized him. He stated in his journal: \\"thus the dead was brought to life again; thus the lost was found.\\" His experience is related to that of Lazarus and Joseph, both of whom were important figures among black Christians who were enslaved or held captive and longed for freedom and a rebirth. He sought work on plantations as a free carpenter, and conducted missionary work with slaves until the start of the American Revolution. Although some owners objected, others allowed slaves to become Christianized. American Revolutionary War During the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), Marrant was impressed, or kidnapped, into the Royal Navy, serving as a musician for more than six years before being discharged in 1782. In 1780, he was at the Siege of Charleston. One year later, he was wounded near the Dogger Bank. He described battles in his Narrative, but official records do not document him as having served with the Navy. During the war, blacks were told that if they were loyal to the British, they would gain their freedom. There were 3,000 people who took the agreement and were called Black Loyalists. In 1783, they were transported to Nova Scotia after their names were recorded in the Book of Negroes, also called the New York City Inspection Roll of Negroes. The Black Loyalists were interested in learning about Christianity. Marrant's brother sent him a letter asking for him to come to Nova Scotia. Ministry Marrant worked for a clothing or cotton merchant in London after he was discharged from the Navy. While in London, he met Rev. Whitehead and told him of his dramatic conversion. Whitehead introduced him to Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, who encouraged him to become a minister. He thus joined the ministry of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, which was a sect that practiced a combination of Calvinism and Methodism. It separated from the Church of England in 1783. After he was ordained as a preacher on May 15, 1785 in Bath, Marrant left for Nova Scotia. After an eleven-week journey from England, he arrived in Nova Scotia in November 1785. Birchtown, Nova Scotia, Heritage Trail He lived at Birchtown, Nova Scotia, the largest new black community, where he founded a Huntingdonian church.Sidbury (2007), p. 87 Marrant served the black people in the Birchtown area and developed a strong Christian community there. He travelled throughout Nova Scotia to other towns where Black Loyalists settled, such as Jordan River and Cape Negro. He also spoke to white congregations and First Nation people, the MiÍûåkmaqs. When he delivered sermons, he used specific Bible verses to infer that he was a prophet sent to Nova Scotia to help raise up the Black Loyalists that listen to him. Further, he said that those who did not listen to him would perish. These kinds of messages were threatening to white residents. Speaking to the hardships that blacks endured, he said that lessons from God where often hidden: \\"God often hides the sensible signs of his favor from his dearest friends‚Ä¶ real Christians, whilst they are among fiery serpents are awaiting with desire, and holy expectations, for the good of the promise.\\" He had difficulty among other churches, particularly other Methodist churches. White ministers were especially upset when members of their congregations attended Morrant's services. He inspired the creation of Christian faith among black communities, including religious leaders Boston King, John Ball, and Moses Wilkinson, who were Methodists. Another was David George, a Baptist. He did not receive the monies he expected from the Countess for his missionary work in Nova Scotia and suffered a six-month bout of smallpox. In 1787, Marrant traveled to Boston, Massachusetts. The next year, he became the chaplain of the African Masonic Lodge in Boston, a group active in the movement to abolish slavery in the United States. This was one of the first American organizations to have the name \\"African\\" in its title, representing the emerging identity of people of African descent in the United States after the Revolution. In a speech at the Lodge, published in 1789, Marrant described the black people as \\"an essentially distinct nation within a Christian universalist family of mankind.\\"Sidbury (2007), p. 88 Author In 1785, with the help of Rev. William Aldridge, he published A Narrative of the Lord's Wonderful Dealings with John Marrant, A Black, with the assistance of William Aldridge, who transcribed it. The narrative told of his time living with Cherokee people, and became on of the most popular stories of that kind. It also told of his conversion to Christianity and his observances of the condition and experiences of blacks in the Colonial period. Critics have noted that the narrative has a very different tone to his later publications. Scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. has argued in The Signifying Monkey that many early African- American narratives were transcribed by white editors, who sometimes influenced the style of such narratives. Marrant delivered a sermon A Sermon Preached on the 24th Day of June 1789...at the Request of the Right Worshipful the Grand Master Prince Hall, and the Rest of the Brethren of the African Lodge of the Honorable Society of Free and Accepted Masons in Boston in 1789 noting the equality of men before God; it was published. His final published work was a 1790 journal, A Journal of the Rev. John Marrant, from August the 18th, 1785, to the 16th of March, 1790. Personal life He married Elizabeth Herries, whose parents were Black Loyalists, on August 15, 1788 at Birchtown, Nova Scotia and returned with her to Boston. In a letter to Marrant, Margaret Blucke (wife of Stephen Blucke), asked about Marrant's children. He may have been previously married or adopted children. There is also boy that travelled with him. His name is not mentioned in the Journal, but he may have been Anthony Elliot from Birchtown who was an assistant. Marrant traveled to London in 1789 or 1790, where the journal of the previous five years was published. He preached in chapels in London, including the Whitechapel area. He died on April 15, 1791 in Islington and was buried at the chapel graveyard on Church Street. Legacy Marrant did not live a long life, but he influenced black people in the United States and Canada, including the Black Loyalists who settled in Sierra Leone in Africa in 1792. He inspired future generations through his narrative. He shared a message of perseverance and faith.

For nearly forty years, he was an in-house artist for Fairchild Publications, owner of Women's Wear Daily, the garment industry trade paper, and its offshoot, W. As chief features artist, he helped transform the once- dowdy WWD into the bible of the jet set during the 1960s and 1970s. Babe Paley, Gloria Vanderbilt, Jacqueline de Ribes, Amanda Burden, The Duchess of Windsor, and Gloria Guinness were among the society women who posed for him. Block's incisive yet graceful brushstrokes captured the most important styles of the post-war era, including collections by Norman Norell, Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, Coco Chanel, James Galanos, Givenchy, Pauline Trig√®re, Bill Blass, Halston, and Geoffrey Beene. In the introduction to Drawing Fashion: The Art of Kenneth Paul Block, published in 2008, Isaac Mizrahi described Block's influence: \\"More than any single designer, he gave New York fashion its sophistication. Because he drew Babe Paley and Jackie Kennedy a certain way, they became what he had envisioned.\\" Block often drew under intense deadline pressure. In the May 2009 issue of Vogue, photographer Steven Meisel, who began his career as a fashion artist, recalled Block's composure: \\"He would sit there with this long cigarette holder and a polka-dot bow tie, always a sports jacket, immaculate. He never lost his temper. He had so much style, so much class, so much chic.\\" Growing up in Larchmont, New York in the 1930s, Block was enthralled by the glamorous film stars of the era and by the great fashion artists then working for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Dance and music also influenced his developing artistic style. In 1945, he graduated from the Parsons School of Design. Block joined Fairchild Publications in the mid-1950s. Early assignments included sketching New York ladies on Easter Sunday as they exited churches in their holiday finery, hats and gloves included. As the gentility of the 1950s gave way to the anarchic sixties and beyond, he always kept pace, though he regretted the loss of dignity in fashion; he missed hats and gloves. Even before Block's career began, photography had begun to overtake fashion illustration as the primary method of introducing new styles. Block helped keep his m√©tier alive. He stayed with Fairchild until 1992, when all the company's artists were let go on the same day. Concurrent with his editorial work, and for a dozen years after his career at Fairchild ended, Block created a prodigious portfolio of commercial fashion art, including drawings made during successive long-term contracts with three of New York's best-known specialty stores‚ÄîBonwit Teller, Bergdorf Goodman, and Lord & Taylor. Other commercial clients included Halston, Perry Ellis, and Coach. When Diana Vreeland joined the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, she immediately turned to Block to draw the poster for her first exhibit, on Crist√≥bal Balenciaga. He also created a drawing for Vreeland's \\"American Women of Style\\" exhibit. The women in Block's drawings were known for exuding a languid sort of chic. \\"Gesture to me is everything in fashion,\\" he said. His long term companion was Morton Ribyat.

From 1800 to 1806, the room was the lower half of the first United States Senate chamber, and from 1810 to 1860, the courtroom for the Supreme Court of the United States.  History and use  Construction on the North Wing began in 1793 with the laying of the cornerstone by President George Washington. Although interior work was unfinished, the Senate relocated from its 1791 Philadelphia location, Congress Hall, in November 1800. The interior of the chamber, including an upper level public gallery, was finally completed early in 1805, just in time for the start of the Samuel Chase impeachment trial.Herbert S. Parmet and Marie B. Hecht, Aaron Burr: Portrait of an Ambitious Man (1967), p.226 Its completion allowed the Federal government to move to Washington, D.C.. The North Wing, as the only completed section of the Capitol, originally hosted both houses of the United States Congress, the Library of Congress, and the Supreme Court. The North Wing upon completion in 1800 In addition to the Chase trial, the chamber was the location of President Thomas Jefferson's inauguration in 1801. However, by 1806, the North Wing was already deteriorating from heavy use and required repairs. The Architect of the Capitol at the time, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, decided that the repairs would provide an opportunity to expand room space in the Capitol by dividing the chamber in half. The upper half would serve as a new chamber for the Senate (that area is now known as the Old Senate Chamber), and the lower half would be used for the Supreme Court. In 1844, Samuel Morse sent the first Morse coded message--which read \\"What hath God wrought?\\"--from this room.Samuel F.B. Morse = Design and construction = The size and structure of Latrobe's vaulted, semicircular ceiling were virtually unprecedented in the United States. The room is deep and wide. Construction began in November 1806 with the gutting of the former two-story Senate Chamber and rooms above it, and lasted until 1810. The process was not without tragedy, when an assistant to Latrobe, John Lenthall, Clerk of the Works, was killed upon removing a center wooden ceiling support prematurely against Latrobe's advice. The result was that the unfinished masonry ceiling collapsed crushing Lenthall in the process. Lenthall's death was a setback, not only to construction, but to Latrobe's reputation as an architect, which he struggled to rebuild for the rest of his career. = Fire of 1814 and reconstruction = Chief Justice John Marshall The Supreme Court barely had the opportunity to hear cases in the chamber, before the justices were forced to leave Washington by the threat of British invasion during the War of 1812. On August 24, 1814, the British successfully took the city, and set fire to many of the recently completed buildings of the fledgling capital, including the North and South wings of the Capitol building. Despite the disaster which left much of the North Wing gutted, the chamber with its vaulted ceiling survived. With safety in mind, however, Latrobe ordered the ceiling broken down and rebuilt for the final time in 1815. Latrobe resigned two years later, and it was under his successor, Charles Bulfinch, that the chamber was completed in 1819, in time for the next session of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court resided in the chamber for the next forty-one years, until 1860. In that time period, the court heard arguments on such landmark cases as McCulloch v. Maryland, Gibbons v. Ogden, Dred Scott v. Sandford, and United States v. The Amistad. Two Chief Justices‚ÄîJohn Marshall and Roger Taney‚Äîpresided over the Supreme Court in the chamber. The Law Library of Congress occupied the chamber 1860‚Äì1941 = Post- Supreme Court and restoration = Upon the departure of the Supreme Court to the Old Senate Chamber upstairs in 1860, the chamber was put to use as the Law Library of Congress until 1941. After the Supreme Court vacated the Capitol building itself for their present-day quarters in the Supreme Court building, the room was used as a reference library, and later as a committee room for the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy from 1955 to 1960. From 1960 to 1972, the chamber was given the rather mundane purpose of being a storage room, until Congress voted to restore the chamber to its antebellum appearance where everyday citizens can come and visit the historic site. An 1854 diagram of the chamber was used to establish the layout and positioning of furniture in the chamber, and a portrait of John Marshall provided clues towards a mahogany railing and the carpet pattern. Still existing furnishings in the possession of the United States Capitol were sent to the chamber, as well as donated items such as Roger Taney's chair. By 1975, the chamber was opened to the public and has served as a museum ever since.  Artwork in the Old Supreme Court Chamber  View of Room from Justices' desks. There are several notable pieces of artwork in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. There are four marble busts of the first four Chief Justices of the Supreme Court: John Jay, John Rutledge, Oliver Ellsworth, and John Marshall. A bust of Roger Taney, as well his original robe on display, is found in the adjacent robing room, which serves as the entrance for visitors into the chamber. Above one fireplace is a clock that is said apocryphally to be ordered by Roger Taney and set five minutes forward under his direction to promote promptness on the court proceedings. Above the clock is a plaster relief of Lady Justice, notable for a lack of blindfold. She is accompanied by America, depicted as a winged youth, holding the United States Constitution as a star overhead shines light upon the document. Although never specified by the artist, Justice looks to the document with her unblinded eyes. An eagle seen protecting law books and an owl beneath Justice, two symbolic birds, are featured in the sculpture. The relief was the work of Carlo Franzoni in 1817.  Taney Controversy  In the midst of the George Floyd protests, due to Taney's role in the widely- condemned case of Dred Scott v. Sandford the U.S. House of Representatives voted on July 22, 2020, to remove the bust of Taney (as well as statues honoring figures who were part of the Confederacy during the Civil War) from the U.S. Capitol and replace it with a bust of Justice Thurgood Marshall. The bill called for removal of Taney's bust within 30 days of the law's passage. The bill also created \\"a process to obtain a bust of Marshall, the high court's first African American justice, and place it there within a minimum of two years.\\"  Gallery  Image:Old US Supreme Court.jpg Image:Old US Supreme Court 2.jpg Image:Supreme Court courtroom in Capitol.jpg  Notes  Category:United States Capitol rooms Category:Supreme Court of the United States Category:Courthouses in Washington, D.C.

A brick house with the living and sleeping rooms all on one floor under a single hipped roof, the Cheney House has a less monumental and more intimate quality than the design for the Arthur Heurtley House. The intimacy of the Cheney house is due to the building not being a full story off the ground and being sequestered from the main street by a walled terrace. In addition, its windows are nestled between the wide eaves of the roof and the substantial stone sill that girdles the house.Guide to Frank Lloyd Wright & Prairie School Architecture in Oak Park, Paul E. Sprague, 1986http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1VTG The living rooms, which take up the entire front of the house and open onto the walled terrace at the center, are trimmed in fir. Together they form a single longitudinal space under a continuous ceiling carried up in the form of a hip roof, the whole subdivided into dining room, living room, and library by wooden posts and cabinets. The basement features a large in-law suite. The house is currently a bed-and- breakfast inn. It was this commission that precipitated the celebrated love affair between Wright, and Edwin's wife, Mamah Cheney (n√© Borthwick), the climax of which occurred in 1909 when Wright abandoned his architectural practice and left with Mrs. Cheney for a year in Europe. This era of Wright's life ended in 1914 when the former Mrs. Cheney (by then divorced, and legally Mamah Borthwick), her children, and four others, were murdered at Taliesin by an insane servant.

Variants include: *Lea ‚Äì Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, German, Norwegian, Slovene, Swedish, Polish, Yoruba *L√©a ‚Äì French *Leah ‚Äì English, Hebrew *Leia ‚Äì Koine Greek *Lƒója ‚Äì Lithuanian *Lia ‚Äì Ecclesiastical Latin, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian *L√≠a ‚Äì Galician *Lya *ŒõŒµŒØŒ± (Lia) ‚Äì Greek *Liia ‚Äì Estonian *Lija ‚Äì Latvian *Lea - Serbian Since 1880, the name Leah has never been outside of the top 500 baby girl name in the US. Its peak usage in the US was reached in 2010 when the name was ranked as the 24th most popular name for baby girls. Elsewhere it became a more popular name within the late 1990s and early 2000s. In the UK it was a top 50 name from 1996 until 2011, in Ireland it was a top 25 name from 2002 until 2014, and in Norway it was a top 100 name from 2003 through 2014.

These slang terms are now considered obscure and obsolete. \\"Tuckahoe\\" refers to the low-country, slave-owning plantation owners, with all of their economic, political, social, and English (mostly from Northern and Western England) ethnic traits. The \\"cohee\\" were typically non-Anglican, poor, non-slave-owning, hard-scrabble independent farmers, moving into or through the hills and mountainous regions of Virginia and both Carolinas. Both \\"tuckahoe\\" and \\"cohee\\" were often used as terms of disparagement and derision by the opposing group. Background The word \\"tuckahoe\\" first appears on a map drawn by Captain John Smith in 1612, providing a Powhatan Indian word to describe an edible plant or fungus utilized by tribes in the tidewater area of the present Virginia and North Carolina. The use of the word to describe the aristocratic, affluent and politically powerful class of low-country Virginia/Carolina planters probably originated in the decades prior to the Revolutionary War (ca 1740-1770). It was during this period that the Great Wagon Road, originating in Pennsylvania, and the Valley Pike, transiting the lower Shenandoah Valley, became a major highway funneling a steady stream of poor, largely Scotch-Irish and Pennsylvania German families south and west into upland Virginia (later into upcountry North and South Carolina and eventually into Tennessee and Kentucky) in search of cheap land. These early up-country settlers shared little of the ethnic, social or religious roots of the low-country, which had been founded and developed by English-Anglican colonists over the previous 100-plus years. Politically, the low-country governments of Virginia and the Carolinas did little to assist and much to exploit this cohee migration. During the earliest decades, the established Anglican Church refused to recognize Presbyterian weddings and required exorbitant marriage bond fees of the up-country settlers in order to obtain a legally recognized marriage certificate. Failure to obtain legal marriage documentation could have severe consequences when trying to sell land, and during the handling of estates. Similarly, upcountry political representation in colony governments was inhibited, while wealthy low-country aristocrats held dominance in political, military and taxation matters. The stage was set for a major cultural divide, and tuckahoe-cohee antagonism grew from this early social dynamic. The term \\"cohee\\" has been traced to the Scotch-Irish dialect/accent, for \\"quoth he\\" used instead of \\"he said\\" in normal conversation of the time. It tended to sound like \\"quo he\\" which became \\"cohee\\" to the lowland Virginia planters. Thus the term \\"cohee\\" is tightly associated with the Presbyterian Scots-Irish upland settlers and most powerfully expressed in western Virginia and western North Carolina. In the Piedmont area of Virginia and the Carolinas, these \\"northward\\" families mixed with low-country families migrating westward. First in the Piedmont, later in the Blue Ridge and Appalachian Mountain regions, and still later in the eastern regions of the Mississippi River valley, these two cultures co-existed and competed for political and economic resources. By the middle 19th century, some writers were describing the sectionalism of American politics as the conflict between \\"yankee\\", \\"tuckahoe\\" and \\"cohee\\" cultures representing, respectively, mercantile New England, the slave-owning southern agriculturist, and the western self-reliant pioneer. Tuckahoe/Cohee cultural comparison One of the most distinct and enduring differences between tuckahoe and cohee settlers was their view of black slavery as a moral institution. The cohee typically exhibited ambivalence or antipathy toward slavery; while tuckahoe sentiments were overwhelmingly positive toward slavery. In the late 18th century, lowland society often used \\"cohee\\" as a term of disparagement meant to refer to any white back-country settler who was under-educated, rough, and/or poor. Likewise, the poor independent farmer of the upcountry could heap upon any white man raised in tidewater Virginia/Carolina the disparaging term of \\"tuckahoe\\" if he exhibited traits of aristocracy, ineffectualness, lack of knowledge of the back-country, or other \\"effete\\" characteristics, whether or not he was raised on a plantation. The tuckahoe, as a cultural group, came to an abrupt and final ending with the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, and the emancipation of the slaves. Without the economic engine of slavery, the large plantations could no longer supply the wealth necessary to support the aristocratic tuckahoe life-style. After 1865, \\"tuckahoe\\" became an historical term, used almost exclusively in the past tense. Without its cultural apposition, \\"cohee\\" too lost its original meaning as a social or cultural identity soon after the ending of the American Civil War. Thus, \\"tuckahoe\\" and \\"cohee\\" quickly evolved into solely self-referential terms describing a family's ethnic and cultural lineage, independent of social class or wealth. A similar pattern developed on the other side of the mountains, in Tennessee and Alabama.  Sources and references  Joseph Waddell, in his Annals of Augusta County Virginia (1885) states: > The Tuckahoe carried himself rather pompously, and pronounced many words as > his English forefathers did in the days of Queen Elizabeth. The Cohee was > plain and even blunt in his manners, and every now and then gave utterance > to words which had come down to him from his Scots-Irish ancestors, and > which the Tuckahoe did not understand. Each thought the other spoke a mere > jargon. James Kirke Paulding's Letters from the South, written during an Excursion in the Summer of 1816. NY: James Eastburn (1817) states that the tuckahoe: > ‚Ä¶is a gallant, high-spirited, lofty, lazy sort of being, much more likely to > spend money than earn it, and who, however he may consume, is not very > likely to add much to the fruits of the earth. People are very apt to judge > of themselves by a comparison with others, and the Tuckahoe, feeling himself > so greatly superior to his slaves, is inclined to hold every body else > equally his inferior. This sense of imaginary superiority is the parent of > high qualities, and prevents the possessor very often from indulging mean > and contemptible propensities. Pride, indeed, is a great preserver of human > virtue, which is often so weak as to require the support of some prop less > pure than itself. Hence it is, that the pride of family, and the sense of > superiority, when properly directed, are the parents of high heroic > characteristics, just as when improperly directed they are used for licenses > for every series of debauchery, and justifications for every breach of > morality and decorum. To minds properly constituted, the reputation of a > father is a spur to excellence, a conservator of virtue; but to petty > intellects, it is a mere diploma of folly and impertinence. The last think, > because they were hatched in the eagles' nest, they must, of necessity, be > young eagles, whether they take their lofty flight in regions of the stars > or wallow in the puddles with geese and swine. The Tuckahoe of the better > sort is a gallant, generous person, who is much better qualified to defend > his country in time of war, than to enrich it in a period of peace. He is > like a singed cat, and very often takes as much pains to appear worse than > he is, as some people among us do to appear better. In short, the Tuckahoe > belongs to a class of beings, among whom, in times of great danger, when the > existence of a people is at stake, will be found the men who will be most > likely to sink or swim with their country. Manual industry seldom produces > great men, and it is not often that the best citizens make the bravest > soldiers. Paulding discusses the \\"Cohee\\" as hard working family farmers with high levels of self-sufficiency. Rhys Isaac, in The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790 (1982) characterized these two cultures {tuckahoe/cohee} as split between a non-evangelical and evangelical practice of Christianity. Ernest Sutherland Bates' American Faith: Its Religious, Political, and Economic Foundations (1940) states that Tuckahoe and Cohee > ‚Ä¶applied to the residents of Tidewater and Piedmont, and were territorial > rather than class designations. There were poor as well a rich \\"Tuckahoes,\\" > and there were rich and poor \\"Cohees.\\" Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker's Old South: The Founding of American Civilization (1963) has a chapter titled \\"Tuckahoe and Cohee\\" describing the tensions between the two cultures. Richard B. Drake's A History of Appalachia (2001) has a chapter titled \\"Backwoods-Cohee Society\\" and identifies the term \\"Cohee\\" as a self-referential word used by \\"backwoodsmen\\" who settled the western part of Virginia (now West Virginia) to differentiate themselves from the elite \\"Tuckahoes\\". Elizabeth A. Perkins' Border Life: Experience and Memory in the Revolutionary Ohio Valley (1998) states: > ‚Ä¶by the late eighteenth century \\"tuckahoe\\" became a common name for an > inhabitant of the lowlands of Virginia. The tuckahoe's counterpart was the > \\"cohee,\\" a resident living west of the Blue Ridge. In 1786 a Kentukian wrote > to the governor of Virginia that \\"...we have two sorts of people in this > country, one called tuckyhoes, being Generall. of the Lowland old > Virginians. The other class is Called cohees, Generally made up of Backwoods > Virginians and Northward men, Scots, Irish, & c., which seems, In some > measure, to make Distinctions and Particions amongst us. Perkins continues: > A settler similarly explained to John Shane that \\"Irish mostly from > Pennsylvania country and South Carolina were called Cohees. Mostly > Presbyterians. Virginians were called Tuckahoes. You could tell where a man > was from, on first seeing him. Perkins then summarizes: > Braiding together a complex skein of social and cultural identities, the > distinction between cohee and tuckahoe transcended wealth, ethnicity, or > religion alone; depending on the circumstance, the terms implied any, or > all, of these meanings. Gerald Milnes' \\"Play of a Fiddle\\", University Press of Kentucky 1999, , pps 67-69. describes tuckahoe and cohee cultures from the perspective of West Virginia, and relates folk songs from each culture describing the opposing culture's foibles in caricature. David Hackett Fischer's \\"Albion's Seed - Four British Folkways in America\\", Oxford University Press 1989, describes the cultural genesis of the cohees in America as \\"The Flight From North Britain, 1717-1775\\" pps 605-782. Without ever using the appellation \\"cohee\\" he describes the \\"backcountry\\" settlers of early America as originating in the borderlands of northern England, southern Scotland, and northern Ireland.

It is organized at national level and has a unitary command under the Inspector General of Police (IGP). Although there are many regional and divisional commands, they all report to the National Headquarters in Accra. History Policing in Ghana (then the Gold Coast) was originally organized by traditional authorities led by local kings or chiefs. This they did by employing unpaid messengers to carry out executive and judicial functions in their respective communities. Professional policing was introduced by the British Colonial authorities in 1831. The colonial administrator at the time, Captain George Maclean, Governor of the Gold Coast, recruited 129 men to patrol the trade routes between Ashanti Kingdom and the coast and to protect colonial merchants and officials around the castle. In 1844, these troops were taken over by the British colonial authorities and became the \\"Gold Coast Militia and Police\\". In 1871 when the British assumed full sovereignty over the Gold Coast, the 90 men in the Police force was reinforced with a further 400 men. All the commissioned officers at the time were British. The force became the \\"Gold Coast Constabulary\\" in 1876. The Police Ordinance, passed in 1894, gave legal backing to the formation of a civilian police force in the colony. By 1902, the police had been divided into General, Escort, Mines and Railway Police and this was legalised by the Police [Amendment] Ordinance of 1904. A Marine Police unit was formed in 1906. This was replaced by the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service in 1942. The Criminal Investigation Department was established in 1922. Following the riots of 1948 led by the Big Six, the Special Branch and the Police Reserves Unit was formed for riot control and prevent destabilization of the government. The Special Branch was to gather intelligence though it was also used to hound political opponents. The Reserves unit was known to deal harshly with street demonstrators and protestors. The Wireless and Communications Unit was opened in June 1950. A women's branch was established with 12 officers in 1952. The Police College was opened in 1959. Prior to this, all officers were trained in the United Kingdom. Ghana has now sought to secure advanced training programs from World Police Academy Canada and the Royal Ulster Constabulary Ireland. The first Ghanaian to head the Ghana Police was E. R. T. Madjitey, who was appointed on October 9, 1958. Organization The grounds of the Ghana Police College, in Accra. =National= The Inspector General of Police (IGP) is the head of the Ghana Police service. He is aided by 2 Deputy IGPs responsible for administration and operations. The police structure is organized at national level into ten schedules each headed by a Commissioner. The schedules are: Operations * Criminal Investigation Department (CID) *Legal and Special Duties * Logistics and Support Services * Operations * Police Intelligence and Professional Standards Bureau Administration *Human Resource Development * Welfare * Research, Planning and Information Communication and Technology * Strategic Direction and Monitoring * Finance =Regions= There are 13 regions under the police service. Each of them is headed by a Regional Commander with a rank of Assistant Commissioner. There are the ten geographical regions, Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern, Greater Accra, Northern, Upper East, Upper West, Volta and Western regions. The last three regions are Tema, Railway and Ports, and finally National Headquarters. =Divisions= Each region with the exception of the National Headquarters is divided into divisions. There are 51 divisions nationwide. These are further subdivided into 179 Districts and 651 Stations across the country. Ranks The ranks of Ghanaian police officers are loosely based on that of the British and other Commonwealth police although there are variations.

Scholars and critics often cite it as the first city comedy.Theodore B. Leinwand, The city staged : Jacobean comedy, 1603-1613, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1986, p. 7. Indeed, the play inaugurated a dramatic subgenre that would be exploited and developed by Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton, Ben Jonson, and others in the following years and decades. Performance and publication The records of theater manager and impresario Philip Henslowe show that Haughton received payment for his work on the play between February and May 1598. The play is thought to have been premiered onstage, by the Admiral's Men at the Rose Theatre, before the end of that year. The work was entered into the Stationers' Register on 3 August 1601, but was not published until 1616, when the first quarto edition was issued by the stationer William White. A second quarto appeared in 1626, printed by John Norton for bookseller Hugh Perry, and a third in 1631, printed by Augustine Matthews for Richard Thrale.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 334‚Äì5. Plot The play is set within the contemporary merchant class of London, the men who dealt on the Royal Exchange founded by Sir Thomas Gresham. The Portuguese-born merchant and moneylender Pisaro has three half- English daughters, Laurentia, Marina, and Mathea. The daughters face two trios of suitors, one foreign and one domestic. The foreigners are Delion, a Frenchman, Alvaro, an Italian, and Vandal, a Dutchman. Also a foreigner, Pisaro favours these candidates because of their wealth, but his daughters prefer their English suitors, Harvey, Heigham, and Walgrave. The play is rich in linguistic play, courtship scenes, and disguises and cross-dressing, and includes abundant comic material from the clown Frisco. In the end, as the title indicates, the Englishmen win their brides (which importantly helps to cancel the debts they owe to Pisaro). Criticism The play displays a popular dislike of Englishwomen being courted by foreigners that is also expressed in Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, which was written and acted at about the same time (c. 1597‚Äì99). Critics have studied the play for its attitude toward, and treatment of, foreigners in England.A. J. Hoenselaars, Images of Englishmen and Foreigners in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporarie,. Rutherford, New Jersey, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1992; pp. 53‚Äì62.

The site was launched in August 2006.John Berthelsen on the future of Asia Sentinel \\"Asia Sentinel was created to provide a platform for news, analysis and opinion on national and regional issues in Asia. It is independent of all governments and major media enterprises. It is open to contributions not only from journalists but from professionals in fields such as finance, diplomacy, science and the arts. It has no ideology other than a belief in the benefits of a free media. It will not publish editorials but give free rein to diverse opinions,\\" says the founders' statement on the site.Asia Sentinel - About Us  Establishment  Headquartered in Hong Kong, it was founded by four senior expatriate journalists with long experience in the region. The editor, John Berthelsen, is a former correspondent with The Wall Street Journal Asia who was also the Managing Editor of The Standard in Hong Kong. Consulting Editor Philip Bowring is the former editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review and a former columnist for the International Herald Tribune. Executive Editor A. Lin Neumann, the former Executive Editor of The Standard, also represented the Committee to Protect Journalists in Asia for many years. The fourth founder, Anthony Spaeth, is a former Time Asia regional correspondent who left Asia Sentinel shortly after its founding to go to work for Bloomberg. Kevin Phillips, the International Business Director, was formerly Head of Equities in Hong Kong and Tokyo for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the investment bank. The editors have lived in or covered most of the countries in Asia, including Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Thailand and Indonesia.  Response to shrinking Asia coverage  The site is a response to the shrinking coverage of Asia in regional western-owned publications, notably Asiaweek, which was shut down by Time Inc. in 2002; and the Far Eastern Economic Review, which went from being a weekly news magazine to a monthly journal when Dow Jones & Co. was cutting costs in 2004. The correspondents for the site are drawn from journalists around the region and the site says it is always looking for contributors. The site has delivered strong coverage of Hong Kong, with a series of stories on the power structure and tycoon-friendly development policies of the territory; Singapore, with a series on the authoritarian rule of the city-state; and Thailand, as it has published stories probing the role of the Thai king in political events, a subject often off limits to mainstream journalists due to the country's l√®se majest√© laws. The site also carries reader comments with each story and some threads ‚Äî for instance about racial politics in Malaysia ‚Äî have grown into spirited, months- long debates kicked off by an article or series of articles. Asia Sentinel articles also appear in the Asian Correspondent.

She was owned by Wm. Howard Smith & Sons, Melbourne, Australia, for the transportation of coal and passengers. In 1887, she was wrecked in rough seas near Point Nepean in Victoria, Australia, with the loss of 35 lives, after the propeller was disabled. The beach nearby was subsequently named Cheviot Beach. The ship The Cheviot was built by Charles Mitchell and Co., of Low Walker in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in 1870. It had a tonnage of 1,226 gross and 764 net, dimensions of 230.2 x 32.2 x 17.5 feet in the hold and compound vertical direct acting engines built by T. Clark & Co. In 1876 the ship was registered in Melbourne to Wm. Howard Smith & Sons for use in the inter-colonial passenger and coal-carrying trade. Wreck On the night of 19 October 1887, the Cheviot set out from Melbourne, bound for Sydney, and passed through the heads of Port Phillip Bay. At 8 p.m. and with a south-westerly gale blowing, the ship reached the open sea and the propeller became disabled. As a result, the unpowered ship drifted helplessly towards the shore. As the seas were too rough, it was decided not to launch lifeboats. Sails were set and anchors put out but to no avail as the ship struck the shore at 9 p.m. Rockets were sent up, and help arrived by boat within a few hours, but due to the rough seas the Queenscliff lifeboat was unable to get through the heads. At 4 a.m. the next morning rescuers were able to get a rocket-propelled lifeline to the ship and rescue 24 passengers and crew, however during this operation the ship broke up and sank with many people trapped in the fore-cabin. Aftermath The captain, Thomas B. Richardson, was exonerated by the Steam Navigation Board and was praised for his attempts to save the vessel and those on board. Eight of the victims were buried in the nearby quarantine station cemetery. The site of the tragedy, which became known as Cheviot Beach, was the location of Prime Minister Harold Holt's disappearance and presumed drowning in 1967.

He attended and graduated from the Valley Forge Military Academy He was educated at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and held prominent positions in government and the private sector, including the presidency of the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO). Journalism Roca was the founder and editor of the Puerto Rican newspaper El Vocero, filling a market niche for a crime- oriented tabloid, left by the closing of El Imparcial. Under his editorship, El Vocero evolved into a mainstream newspaper with legitimate news articles, a well-known set of columnists, including Luis D√°vila Col√≥n, Obed Betancourt, Jos√© Arsenio Torres, Roberto Rexach Ben√≠tez, Eudaldo B√°ez Galib and Juan Manuel Garc√≠a Passalacqua, and a wide variety of sections and supplements. =Press freedom= One of his contributions to journalism was his willingness to bankroll freedom of information lawsuits, that have opened government to intense press and public scrutiny. An example is the United States Supreme Court decision declaring unconstitutional the Puerto Rico judiciary's rule barring the press from over 30,000 yearly closed-door preliminary hearings where probable-cause was determined in criminal proceedings (El Vocero de Puerto Rico vs Puerto Rico, 508 US 147 (1993)). Other examples include the 1992 lawsuit that forced political candidates to make public their personal finances, and the case declaring unconstitutional Puerto Rico's \\"criminal defamation\\" law, that had a limiting effect on the exercise of press freedom right in Puerto Rico. Journalism in Puerto Rico, and in the mainland United States, has benefitted from these judicial victories. For example, many freedom of the press court cases and lawsuits filed before state and federal courts cite the holding in El Vocero's 1993 US Supreme Court case.C:\\\\Text\\\\Briefs\\\\Otte v Doe.wpd See also List of Puerto Ricans References External links *El Vocero Category:1926 births Category:2007 deaths Category:People from Yauco, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican journalists Category:Valley Forge Military Academy and College alumni Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Gaspar Roca"},{"id":"11793915","text":"USS Plover (AMc-3) was a Pipit-class coastal minesweeper acquired by the United States Navy for use in World War II.

A portfolio of the applicant's achievements and work experience is presented to a committee at the educational institution. The committee will then decide if the documents presented in the portfolio show work that merits partial credit towards a particular degree. The integrity of the vetting procedure is down to individual institutions, however, to produce a false document in support of an application is a felony punished by a large fine and up to three years in jail in France.  History  A French law, passed August 23, 1985, allowed people with work experience to ask for a Diploma equivalence, but this was mostly for vocational degrees. A significant change came with the Loi de Modernisation Sociale (Law of Social Modernization) dated January 17, 2002, that specifically authorized universities and other \\"√©tablissements d'Enseignement sup√©rieurs\\" (higher education institutions) to grant standard degrees (BTS, DEUG, Licence, Ma√Ætrise, DES, DESS, Master, Mastaire, Doctorat, etc.) based only on the work experience of the candidate. The required minimum of work experience was also lowered from five to three years. Legal status The VAE is now included in the French Code of Education at Part legislative, Third part, Book VI, Title Ier, Chapter III, Section 2, Art. L613-3 to L613-6. It is important to note that Art L- 613-4 states: \\"The validation produces the same effects as the knowledge or aptitude testing process that it replaces.\\" The degrees and diplomas obtained through the VAE process are exactly the same and any mention of the VAE is prohibited in order to fight possible unlawful discrimination. The VAE decision is done on file after interview (electronic or physical) by a VAE Jury made of professors belonging to the university.  Recognition  VAE is now law and all French universities must apply it if asked. In 2005, 21,379 students applied for the VAE, 61% were women. 59% received a full degree. Among those, 10% received a degree equivalent or superior to the bachelor's degree.http://media.education.gouv.fr/file/18/1/3181.pdf More than 1250 bachelor's or higher degrees were granted through the VAE in 2005 in France (+50%). In France the VAE is, according to the government website, in full expansion and universally accepted. Internationally, the countries that ratified the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region recognize it. In the US, credentials evaluators, universities, federal and state governments also recognize the VAE degrees with the notable exception of the state of Oregon.  Non-French speaking students  The VAE works like the European Erasmus Programme and the Bologna declaration on harmonization of European degrees that allows international students to attend French universities. In 2004 The Sorbonne started VAE in foreign languages (English, Spanish & Italian), followed by several other universities. The validation documents provided to the committee at the university deciding the validation must be in a language that the committee members can read and understand if not in French.

More types of agimat. Agimat, also known as anting or anting-anting, is a Filipino word for \\"amulet\\" or \\"charm\\".\\"Tagalog-English Dictionary by Leo James English, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, Manila, distributed by National Book Store, 1583 pages, Anting-anting is also a Filipino system of magic and sorcery with special use of the above-mentioned talismans, amulets, and charms. Other general terms for agimat include bertud and galing. It is part of a wider Southeast Asian tradition of tribal jewelry, as \\"gantung\\" (meaning \\"hanging\\") in Indonesian/Malay and \\"anting-anting\\" (meaning \\"ear pendant\\") in Javanese. Description In the Philippine occult tradition, there is usually a corresponding agimat to deal with in a particular area in a person's life. The most frequent types of agimat are used for removing hexes and exorcism of evil spirits. An agimat also called a gayuma serves as a love charm which makes the owner more attractive to the opposite sex. Although stereotyped as a cross, a flat, round or triangular golden pendant accompanying a necklace or a necklace-like item, it is also depicted as an enchanted stone that came from the sky or a fang left by a lightning strike (pangil ng kidlat) or even a drop of liquid from the heart of a banana tree at midnight (mutya). In relation to the latter, it is usually ingested. An agimat is usually accompanied by a small book of magic incantations which must be read during Good Friday or a certain special date to attain the amulet's full power and benefit. An agimat could also be in the form of a clothing with magic words inscribed on it, or even in the form of edible enchanted mud (putik in Tagalog).Galang, Reynaldo S. \\"Anting anting, the Filipino Warrior's Amulet\\" , Bakbakan International, Bakbakan.com (1994, 1997) Anting-anting worn by the war horses of the Bukidnon people made from shell, bone, and boar's tusks Other methods of obtaining an agimat is by getting the liquid that is drained from an exhumed body of an unbaptized child or aborted fetus or offering food and drinks to the spirits in a cemetery during midnight of Holy Wednesday or Holy Thursday. Most of the amulets bear Latin inscriptions into it. Like those in Quiapo district in Manila, most of the agimat merchants are near churches (like in its courtyard or in the marketplace just nearby). Filipino freedom fighters also wore anting-anting to battle against the Spaniards and the Americans. Filipino hero Macario Sakay wore a vest that has religious images and Latin phrases to protect him from bullets. Former Philippine-President Ferdinand Marcos, was given an anting- anting by Gregorio Aglipay that could supposedly make Marcos invisible.Karnow, Stanley. In Our Image: America‚Äôs Empire in the Philippines, Ballantine Books, Random House, Inc., March 3, 1990, 536 pages, Marcos said that the agimat is a sliver of wood that was inserted into his back before the Bataan campaign on 1942. Earliest reports of anting-anting are from the records of Spanish priests in the early colonial period. Pardo de Tavera defines the anting- anting as \\"an amulet, of super natural power, that saves lives.\\" With the Christianization of the Philippines, anting-anting appropriated the forms of the new religion, and incorporated as well the esoteric symbolisms of Freemasonry. An Islamic version of anting-anting exists in the Southern Muslim islands. In Filipino films, the wearer of the agimat gains superhuman strength, invisibility, heightened senses, self-healing, and elemental powers. With it, the person can also be able to shoot or fire lightning via hands, or generate electricity throughout one's body. The person can also perform telekinesis, stop a live bullet, can have premonitions, invisibility, flight, morphing abilities, camouflage abilities like a chameleon, can have extreme good luck, possess invincibility, or perform miracle curative powers. In his Filipino films, actor Ramon Revilla, Sr., as Nardong Putik, was depicted to have protection from bullets and slash wounds, provided he eats a certain special mud.IMDB Information: Nardong Putik Subtypes Agimat may be further classified into different types based on their purported sorcerous powers, they include: *Kabal (or kunat) - agimat that supposedly make the skin invulnerable to cuts and sword slashes. *Pamako - agimat that supposedly paralyze an opponent *Tagabulag - agimat that supposedly turns the wearer invisible *Tagaliwas - agimat that can supposedly deflect bullets.

The group has recorded one album, released independently. The band was formed in early 2006 by Sanders and singer Jamie Ludbrook with the original intention of reforming Damaged, a grind and death band that had been one of the most popular acts on the domestic music scene during the 1990s, releasing three albums and enduring various periods of well-documented instability and turmoil.Damaged at Ausmetalguide.com Recruiting guitarist Dan \\"Fanza\\" O'Grady and contrabassist Dav Byrne, Sanders and Ludbrook opted for the name Terrorust instead and began work on a CD almost immediately. Apparently insisting on complete independence, the band recorded, produced, and pressed the album itself. Post Mortal Archives was released in mid-2006 in a limited pressing of 1000 hand-numbered copies. The album featured guest contributions from members of Blood Duster, Fuck... I'm Dead and Bestial Warlust. Shortly after the release of the album, guitarist Dave Howells returned to the lineup subsequent to a communication fall out during the writing period. Howells' only writing contribution to the album was in fact the first riff of the song \\"Post Mortal Archives\\". Terrorust made its first major live appearance at an event called the Festival of the Dead in Sydney, headlined by Nevermore; Howells text-messaged the band that he was quitting the night previous to this show. The group was then booked to tour nationally with Deicide in early 2007 and Andrew Gillon, formerly of Abominator, stepped in. Immediately after this tour, Ludbrook acrimoniously parted ways with the band. Matt Storma had provided some backing vocals on the album and was brought in as Ludbrook's replacement. In May, the group appeared on some shows on a tour by Nile and Decapitated, followed by a show with Celtic Frost in June, with Dan Colomb having replaced Gillon. In early 2008 Colomb's place was taken by Steve Watts, formerly of the Wagga Wagga thrash band Manticore which released two EPs in the late 1990s. In early July 2008, Matt Skitz toured Europe as the drummer with Stephen O'Malley, Oren Ambarchi, and Attila Csihar's Gravetemple before returning to Australia for Terrorust's national tour with Dismember later the same month. In October, the band supported Pig Destroyer and Carcass. Terrorust folded in 2009, with 3 members going on to form Insidious Torture.

The film stars Steven Seagal, and was released on direct- to-DVD in the United States on March 4, 2008. Plot Matt Conner is an unemployed, drinking deadbeat. Once he was a police officer who lived with his wife Liz and his daughter Becky. Then, his partner disappeared, along with a large stash of police-impounded money. Due to the fact that Matt was an avid gambler, he was the prime suspect for the crime, but his colleague Steve lied that he and Matt were playing poker, thus giving him an alibi. Since the police still suspected Matt of the crimes, he was thrown off the police force. Matt's wife files for divorce and marries Steve. Matt's daughter Becky stays with Steve while Matt spends his time gambling and heavily drinking. Some time later, Matt's markers from extended gambling are mysteriously picked up. Eventually the collector, called the \\"Old Man\\", sends him a messenger named Blue. Matt is told that he must work off his debt as a hitman for the Old Man's vigilante organization. He begins to receive contracts to kill criminals who avoid arrest with their money and influence. Matt deals with his first assignments without much difficulty. Matt also surprisingly learns that his new girlfriend Drea is also an operative for the Old Man, like Blue. Later, Matt is ordered to kill Steve. He refuses and confronts Blue, the Old Man, and Drea with the assignment. Matt is told that Steve is actually a dirty cop who deals with criminals; Matt refuses to believe this. Elsewhere, Steve kills an innocent chaplain because in a prior confession to the priest Matt had talked about his history with Steve. Steve uses this to frame Blue for the crime. When Matt returns to the church, he swears that he'll avenge the clergyman's death, despite Steve's urgent requests to stay out of the situation. Unwilling to heed Steve's request, Matt is then arrested by Steve for being a \\"material witness\\" and released after two hours because Steve hopes to find the Old Man and kill Matt and Blue through following Matt. Still, Matt and Blue manage to escape. At the priest's funeral, which Matt later attends, Steve and his associates plan to kill Matt. After the funeral ends, a standoff ensues between Matt and Steve. It is revealed that Steve stole the confiscated money and murdered Matt's partner out of fear that he would blow the whistle on Steve's operations. Blue and Drea show up to support Matt, much to the surprise of Steve, and a gunfight ensues. As a trump card, Steve reveals that he is holding Becky hostage, and threatens to kill her if Matt doesn't back down. Drea is able to free Becky while Matt and Blue fight Steve's associates. Blue is mortally wounded and says his goodbyes to Matt before passing. Matt and Steve confront each other once more and Matt successfully kills Steve. Much later, Becky and her father are shown to be reunited and spending more time together than before. The camera cuts to Matt praying in the church as Drea walks in to give Matt his next assignment from the Old Man.

Nascarella as Bruno * Paul Calder√≥n as Blue * Mark Elliot Wilson as Lt. Steve Shacter * Wass Stevens as Tim Wheeler Critical reception The film was better received than many of Seagal's DTV efforts, which have generally been met with disappointment from fans. David Nusair of Reelfilm.com claimed the film, \\"...undeniably does continue the upward trend of Steven Seagal's career trajectory as of late...\\" and that it sports, \\"...a number of surprisingly decent hand-to-hand fighting sequences... echoing some of the best efforts of his early days,\\" though he criticizes the slow pace of the screenplay. Seagalogy author Vern praised the film, calling it \\"a classic of the DTV era,\\" commending the film's better-than-usual cast (particularly Lance Henriksen and Paul Calder√≥n), nuanced storyline, and Seagal's willingness to play an older, more flawed character than he typically does. He compares it to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 2007 film Until Death and Abel Ferrara's 1992 film Bad Lieutenant in its subversion of action icons through the use of an unusually flawed protagonist, and claims that, \\"[Pistol Whipped] has Seagal stretching his persona and exploring new territory without abandoning his classic themes\\". David Johnson of DVD Verdict gave the film a negative review, saying \\"this entry into the Seagal canon is dull,\\" and going on to criticize Seagal's physique and calling the plot, \\"slow-moving, emotionally contrived and utterly predictable.\\" Production It is set and filmed on location in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 37 days on May 20 and June 26, 2007.

It is a slow-growing, long-lived tree, hard to transplant because of its long taproot, and subject to insect damage. The nuts, largest of all hickory nuts, are sweet and edible. Wildlife and people harvest most of them; those remaining produce seedling trees readily. The wood is hard, heavy, strong, and very flexible, making it a favored wood for tool handles. A specimen tree has been reported in Missouri with diameter at breast height, tall, and a spread of .  Habitat  = Native range = Shellbark hickory is widely distributed, but is nowhere common. The range extends from western New York through southern Michigan to southeast Iowa, south through eastern Kansas into northern Oklahoma, and eastward through Tennessee into Pennsylvania. This species is most prominent in the lower Ohio River region and south along the Mississippi River to central Arkansas. It is frequently found in the great river swamps of central Missouri and the Wabash River region in Indiana and Ohio. It's also found scattered in the Hudson valley in New York state In part due to the activities of humans, shellbark hickory has become rare in its natural range. The heavy seeds do not travel far from the parent tree and many stands have been lost to forest clearing and lumber harvesting. It is also not planted much as an ornamental due to its slow growth and difficulty of transplanting. = Climate = The mean length of the frost-free period within the range of shellbark hickory is from 150 to 210 days. The average January temperature is between , and for July the mean temperature is from . An average minimum temperature of occurs in the northern part of the range, and an average maximum temperature of is found throughout the range. Precipitation varies between per year including of snow. = Soils and topography = Shellbark hickory grows best on deep, fertile, moist soils, most typical of the order Alfisols. It does not thrive in heavy clay soils, but grows well on heavy loams or silt loams. Shellbark hickory requires moister situations than do pignut, mockernut, or shagbark hickories (Carya glabra, C. alba, or C. ovata), although it is sometimes found on dry, sandy soils. Specific nutrient requirements are not known, but generally the hickories grow best on neutral or slightly alkaline soils. The species is essentially a bottomland species and is often found on river terraces and second bottoms. Land subject to shallow inundations for a few weeks early in the growing season is favorable for shellbark. However, the tree will grow on a wide range of topographic and physiographic sites. = Associated forest cover = Shellbark hickory may be found in pure groups of several trees but is more frequent singly in association with other hardwoods. The species is a minor component of the forest cover types bur oak (Society of American Foresters type 42), pin oak‚Äìsweetgum (type 65), and swamp chestnut oak‚Äìcherrybark oak (type 91). It may also be found in one or more of the types in which hickories are included, but it is not identified at the species level. Shellbark hickory commonly grows in association with American (Ulmus americana), slippery (U. rubra), and winged elms (U. alata), white (Fraxinus americana) and green ash (F. pennsylvanica), basswood (Tilia americana), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), red maple (Acer rubrum), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and cottonwood (Populus deltoides). It is found in association with four other hickories‚Äìshagbark, mockernut, bitternut (Carya cordiformis), and water (C. aquatica), and numerous oak species, including swamp white (Quercus bicolor), pin (Q. palustris), white (Q. alba), Shumard (Q. shumardii), water (Q. nigra), Delta post (Q. stellata var. paludosa), swamp chestnut (Q. michauxii), and Nuttall (Q. nuttallii). The herbaceous stratum includes numerous sedges and grasses. The shrub and small tree layer may be composed of painted buckeye (Aesculus sylvatica), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), possumhaw (Ilex decidua), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and trumpet-creeper (Campsis radicans).  Life history  = Sapling and pole stages to maturity = Bark Maturing fruit Mature fruit Growth and yield: The hickories as a group grow slowly in diameter, and shellbark hickory is no exception. Sapling size trees average per year in diameter growth, increasing to per year as poles and sawtimber. Second-growth trees show growth rates of per year. Shellbark hickory occasionally grows to a height of and a diameter of . Rooting habit: Shellbark hickory develops a large taproot that penetrates deeply into the soil. Lateral roots emerge at nearly right angles to the taproot, spreading horizontally through the soil. Major distinct lateral roots usually develop 12 inches or more below ground level and appear only after taproot is well formed. In Illinois, root growth was rapid in April, slowed during July and August, increased again in September, and ended in late November. Mycorrhizal associations are formed when trees are young. The only specific fungus identified from shellbark hickory roots is an ectotrophic mycorrhiza, Laccaria ochropurpurea. Reaction to competition: Shellbark hickory is very shade-tolerant, exceeded only by sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus grandifolia). It grows slowly under a dense canopy, however. In stands with only partial shade, it reproduces well. It is a very strong competitor in most of the species associations in which it is found. Under forest conditions, shellbark hickory often develops a clear bole for half its length and has a narrow, oblong crown. Open-grown trees have egg-shaped crowns.Merz, Robert W. 1965. Shellbark hickory (Carya laciniosa (Michx. f.) Loud.). In Silvics of forest trees of the United States. p. 132-135. H. A. Fowells, comp. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Handbook 27 1. Washington, DC. Heavy release sometimes results in epicormic branching. Damaging agents: Although numerous insects and diseases affect hickories, shellbark hickory has no enemies that seriously threaten its development or perpetuation as a species. Seed production can be reduced significantly, however, through attack by several insects. Two of the most important are the pecan weevil (Curculio caryae) and the hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana). The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) feeds in the cambium and seriously weakens or even kills some trees. Adults of the hickory spiral borer (Agrilus arcuatus torquatus) feed on leaves, but the larvae feed beneath the bark and can be very destructive to hickory seedlings. The flatheaded appletree borer (Chrysobothris femorata) likewise is a foliage- feeder as an adult, but its larvae feed on the phloem and outer sapwood. The living-hickory borer (Goes pulcher) feeds in the trunks and branches of trees. A twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) can seriously affect reproduction by killing back the tops of seedlings and sprouts. Both standing dead trees and freshly cut logs are highly susceptible to attacks by numerous species of wood borers. A large number of insect species feed on hickory foliage. None of them causes serious problems for shellbark hickory, although they may be responsible for some stem deformity and growth loss.Baker, Whiteford L. 1976. Eastern forest insects. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication 1175. Washington, DC. 642 p. Shellbark hickory is free of serious diseases, but it is a host species for a variety of fungi. More than 130 fungi have been identified from species of Carya. These include leaf disease, stem canker, wood rot, and root rot-causing fungi. Specific information for shellbark hickory is not available.Hepting, George H. 1971. Diseases of forest and shade trees of the United States. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Handbook 386. Washington, DC. 658 p. Shellbark hickory is susceptible to bole injury from fire, and fire injuries are often invaded by wood rot fungi. It is resistant to snow and ice damage, but is susceptible to frost damage.  Special uses  The seeds within shellbark hickory nuts are edible and consumed by ducks, quail, wild turkeys, squirrels, chipmunks, deer, foxes, raccoons, and white-footed mice. A few plantations of shellbark hickory have been established for nut production, but the nuts are difficult to crack, though the kernel is sweet. The wood is used for furniture, tool handles, sporting goods, veneer, fuelwood, charcoal, and drum sticks.  Genetics  Shellbark hickory hybridizes with the pecan, Carya illinoensis (C. x nussbaumeri Sarg.), and shagbark hickory, C. ovata (C. x dunbarii Sarg.). Shellbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the Carya species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, bitternut, shellbark, and shagbark) have been described.

The Samoa Australia Police Partnership is a component of the Pacific Police Development Program, which is a Government of Australia initiative supporting a broad range of bilateral and multi country police capacity development initiatives throughout the Pacific region. The Samoa Australia Police Partnership commenced in January 2009, prior to which AusAID provided support for police capacity development under the Samoa Police Project (SPP) (2004‚Äì2008). While it is widely recognized that noticeable improvements in SPS performance were achieved during the life of the SPP, it is also acknowledge that ongoing assistance to the SPS is required. With a new Commissioner having been appointed in September 2009, and a new senior executive, it is an opportune time for the AFP to forge a new program of assistance to the SPS.

In 2008, Hyperion Resources Inc., a Dallas-based energy company, had considered placing the , capacity refinery near Elk Point, South Dakota and approximately away from Vermillion, among three other potential locations. Construction was originally intended to begin in 2008, but was progressively delayed. The state construction permit expired on March 15, 2013. The facility, which would process of oil a day and use of water daily from the Missouri River, caused significant controversy among concerned residents of Elk Point and the surrounding area. Prior to the announcement, the project and the company behind it were kept under considerable secrecy. It was known only as \\"Project Gorilla\\" while real estate agents made several purchase agreements on land north and east of Elk Point. Jeff Martin, a newspaper editor at the Argus Leader in Sioux Falls, uncovered two domain names, hyperionelkpoint.com and hyperionsd.com, which led to a news story that identified Hyperion for the first time. Elk Point is the forerunner among three other out-of-state locations Hyperion is considering for the refinery. Opponents are concerned about air, water, and noise pollution; environmental degradation of nearby food crops such as soy beans, corn, and alfalfa; negative effects on the ethanol fuel market and competition with local ethanol-producing farmers; the displacement of thousands of local residents and negative population resettling; potential industrial disasters including explosions, leaks, and spills, reminiscent of the recent explosion at a similar-capacity Texas City Oil Refinery that caused the deaths of 15 workers and injured over 100; contamination and overuse of important water resources from the Missouri River; potential threats of terrorism; and concerns of the sheer size of the facility, which will be over twice the area of Elk Point. In 2012 Hyperion allowed its development options on 5,000 acres of land in Union County to expire.

In the American South it is a dominant plant species found on clay flats and backwater areas near streams and rivers. The species reproduces aggressively both by seed and sprouts from roots and from stumps of cut trees. Water hickory is a major component of wetland forests now in the south eastern US, because of the selective cutting of more desirable tree species for the lumber industry. It is considered important in cleansing drainage waters since the plants slow water flow during flooding, allowing sediments to fall out of the water column. This tree species is tolerant of wet soils but grows best on well draining soils near rivers and other water ways. Habitat =Native range= Water hickory inhabits the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from southeastern Virginia to southern Florida, Alabama, west into eastern Texas, and the Mississippi Valley north to southern Illinois. =Soils and topography= Water hickory attains its best growth on moist but well-drained loamy or silty soils in the Mississippi River Valley and along some Coastal Plain streams. However, because of its slow growth rate and past logging and land management practices, it is rare on these sites except where it has been favored by repeated \\"high-grade\\" logging. Water hickory is now most often found on wet sites where only a few other species of trees grow, it is somewhat intolerant of competition being shade intolerant. It is common on clay flats, sloughs, and backwater areas, but seldom in coastal swamps or sites where soils are continually saturated. The species is most common on soils in the Vertic Haplaquepts subgroup of the order Inceptisols. Water hickory sites are subject to inundation during heavy rains and stream overflow, during droughts these sites dry out and develop cracking of the soil during occasional dry summers. =Associated forest cover= Water hickory is a major component of two forest cover types: Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Society of American Foresters Type 93) and Overcup Oak-Water Hickory (Type 96). It is a minor component in Sweetgurn-Willow Oak (Type 92) and is sometimes found on the edge of Baldcypress (Type 101) and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102). Important associated tree species are Quercus lyrata - Overcup oak, Quercus nuttallii - Nuttall oak, and Quercus phellos - Willow oaks; Ulmus crassifolia - Ceder elm and Ulmus americana - American elm; waterlocust and honeylocust (Gleditsia aquatica and G. triacanthos); pecan; green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica); sugarberry (Celtis laevigata); persimmon (Diospyros virginiana); red maple (Acer rubrum); and baldcypress (Taxodium distichum). The most frequent noncommercial trees and shrubs associated with water hickory are hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), swamp-privet (Forestiera acummata), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), possumhaw (Ilex decidua), and water-elm (Planera aquatica). Life history =Reproduction and early growth= Carya aquatica bud Carya aquatica bud break Water hickory regenerates aggressively from seeds and sprouts. Seeds germinate and become established on disturbed soil or understory duff. To develop, understory seedlings must be released. Many of our present stands of water hickory, especially on imperfectly drained flats, have been regenerated and released by heavy preferential logging of more valuable species. On poorly drained sites, where competition is not so intense, water hickory grows to fill openings created by windthrow and natural mortality as well as logging. Flowering and fruiting- Water hickory is monoecious. Male and female flowers appear during April and May, while the leaves are developing. The male flowers are in stalked catkins on branches of the current or previous year, and the female flowers are in short spikes or stalks. The fruit, covered by a thin husk during development, are thin-shelled, flattened, and have a bitter seed. Nuts fall between October and December of the same year. Seed production and dissemination- Seed production begins when the trees are about 20 years old, or about in d.b.h.. Optimum seed-bearing age is from 40 to 75 years, or after the trees reach in d.b.h. Heavy seed crops are produced in most years, and a thrifty tree may produce up to 70 liters (2 bu) of seeds. There are approximately 440 cleaned seeds per kilogram (200/lb). The seeds are disseminated by water and animals; floodwaters are particularly important in carrying seed to new areas. Seedling development- After seedfall in the autumn, the seeds lie dormant until germination in late April through early June. Rarely do they remain viable until the second spring. Germination is hypogeal. Sometimes nearly 80 percent of the seed crop germinates. As a result, thickets and clumps of water hickory are not unusual. The species is tolerant enough to survive in the understory for at least 15 years, but full sunlight is necessary for development into trees. The relatively slow height growth of water hickory requires that it have near freedom from competition to establish itself in the overstory. Because of their extended dormant season, water hickory seedlings are able to survive late-spring floods better than most of their would-be competitors. Vegetative reproduction- Stumps less than and severed roots of water hickory readily sprout. Sprouts grow three or four times faster than seedlings during the first year or two. Even on poorly drained clay soil, first-year sprouts sometimes are tall. Sprouts tall at 5 years have been reported. Sapling and pole stages to maturity Growth and yield- Water hickory on a good site may reach tall and in diameter, with about of merchantable bole. The tall straight trunk is topped by slender to moderately stout ascending branches. Diameter growth of water hickory is slow for southern species, per year. At 50 years, dominants might average in d.b.h. on good sites and only on poor sites. Site index at base age 50 years ranges between . Slow growth rates are typical of water hickory in competition with oaks, sugarberry, gum, and other species on good sites. Maximum mean annual production of a pure stand (found rarely) on a good site has been established at 10.5 m¬≥/ha (150 ft¬≥/acre). Maximum mean annual production on medium and poor sites was estimated at 7.0 m¬≥/ha (100 ft¬≥/acre) and 3.5 m¬≥/ha (50 ft¬≥/acre), respectively. An average water hickory site might realistically yield 210 m¬≥/ha (3,000 ft¬≥/acre) at maturity. Slow growth and poor sites usually keep yields low. Rooting habit- Water hickory, like other hickories, grows a taproot in the seedling stage. The wet clayey soils where water hickory usually is found restricts the entire root system to fairly shallow depths. The taproot eventually becomes the source of a coarse, widespreading but shallow lateral root system. The taproot of a 30-cm (12-in) individual, excavated on moderately well-drained clayey soil, ended abruptly with three large lateral roots growing out at right angles. Only a few fine roots extended deeper than . Reaction to competition- Water hickory is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance. Owing to its slow growth, poor quality, and consequent low value, most silvicultural operations are intended to favor species other than water hickory. Much \\"high-grade\\" logging has made the species more abundant and widespread than it would have been naturally. Water hickory responds well to release. On better drained sites, cutting or deadening all stems above in d.b.h. should relegate water hickory to a minor position in the future stand. Many seedlings and sprouts may emerge, but most of these are eventually overtopped by faster growing species. In the Overcup Oak-Water Hickory cover type, any kind of harvest will probably result in a major component of water hickory in the future stand. Water control projects that prolong spring flooding tend to favor water hickory. Damaging agents- Water hickory is occasionally damaged by insects. Of several borers that attack water hickory, the living-hickory borer, Goes pulcher, is the most common. Borer attacks most often occur on young trees up to in diameter. Trunks weakened by tunnels sometimes break, and logs formerly infested by borers are of low value. Although this borer is widely distributed, damaging populations are rather local. Leaf-eating insects, especially the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria, occasionally defoliate trees. Diseases are ordinarily unimportant to water hickory. Butt and stem rots entering through wounds from fire or logging can be a major source of cull. Heart-rot fungi tend to spread faster in the trunks of this species than in associated oaks and other bottom-land hardwoods. The major defect of water hickory is \\"shake,\\" found especially in trees on waterlogged sites; yellow-bellied sapsuckers also cause defects. Water hickory tends to support more mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum) than any of its associated species. Special uses The nuts of water hickory are used to a limited extent by ducks, squirrels, feral hogs, and other wildlife. Water hickory is occasionally planted or retained In natural stands for a shade tree. The wood is a locally preferred firewood and sometimes used to make fence posts.Florida Forestry Information - Juglandaceae Low floodplains, in which water hickory is a dominant species, are being increasingly recognized for their ability to cleanse drainage water and provide refuge for many threatened species of plants and animals. Genetics No races have been recorded; population and geographic variations have not been studied except for the hybrid Carya x lecontei Little (C. aquatica x illinoensis). This hybrid is fairly common where the range of the two parent species overlaps. One other hybrid is recognized, C. x ludoviciana (Ashe) Little (C. aquatica x texana).

Little is known of the growth rate of nutmeg hickory. Logs and lumber are sold mixed with other hickories. The nuts are an oil-rich food for wildlife. Habitat =Native range= Nutmeg hickory is the rarest species in the genus, occurring in a few areas scattered in southeastern North Carolina, eastern South Carolina, central Alabama and Mississippi, northern Louisiana, southern Arkansas, eastern Texas, and northeastern Mexico. The species is typically found in river bottomlands with calcareous soil or marl ridges.Stone, Donald E. 1997. \\"Carya myristiciformis\\". In Flora of North America, vol. 3, Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 420-421. Accessed June 2, 2008 The species is abundant only near Selma, Alabama, and in southern Arkansas. Nutmeg hickory has a native range nearly identical with that of Durand Oak (Q. durandii var. durandii). Both may be relics of a more ancient flora than now occupies the region. =Climate= Precipitation within the range of nutmeg hickory varies from 1020 to 1400 mm (40 to 55 in) per year, 510 mm (20 in) or more falling during the growing season. The frost-free period of most of the native range is about 240 days. Summers are warm and dry in the western portion of the range, but warm and wet in the South Carolina disjuncts. July temperatures average about 27 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F). January temperatures average between 7¬∞ and 10 ¬∞C (45¬∞ and 50 ¬∞F). Extremes of temperature are -23¬∞ to 43 ¬∞C (-10¬∞ to 110 ¬∞F). =Soils and topography= Nutmeg hickory grows on a variety of loamy, silty, or clayey soils that may be described as moist, but well or moderately well drained and amply supplied with mineral nutrients. The species most often is found in minor stream bottoms, on second bottom flats, and on slopes or bluffs near streams. The principal soils on which nutmeg hickory is generally found are in the orders Alfisols and Inceptisols. =Associated forest cover= Nutmeg hickory is not an important species in any forest cover type and is only a minor associate in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 91).Eyre, F. H., ed. 1980. Forest cover types of the United States and Canada. Society of American Foresters, Washington, DC. 148 p. Other prominent associates in this type include white ash (Fraxinus americana); shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), shellbark hickory (Carya laciniosa), mockernut hickory (C. tomentosa), and bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis); Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii); and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Less important associates are willow oak (Quercus phellos), water oak (Quercus nigra), and Durand oaks (Quercus durandii); American elm (Ulmus americana) and winged elms (Ulmus alata); yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera); and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Some common small trees and shrubs occurring with nutmeg hickory are eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and oakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia). One survey near Charleston, SC, found red buckeye (Aesculus pavia), eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), and witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) associated with nutmeg hickory. Nutmeg hickory is often found in association with native American campsites, often in close association with several other hickory species. This is especially evident at sites on the banks of the Alabama river near Selma where Nutmeg hickory, bitternut, pignut, and Mockernut are found in close association in mixed groves of hardwood.http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/spotlight.host.html/content/shared/university/news/news- center-releases/2015/05/048.detail.html Life history =Reproduction and early growth= The species is monoecious and forms imperfect flowers. Both male and female flowers are found on the current year's growth. The male flowers are long-stalked catkins, developing at the shoot base.Sargent, Charles Sprague. 1965. Manual of the trees of North America. vol. 1. Dover, New York. (Reprint of 1926 revision, Houghton Mifflin, New York.) 934 p. The female flowers are in short spikes on peduncles at the end of the shoot. Flowering occurs from April to May, shortly after the leaves have started to open. Specifies of pollen production, dissemination and pollination are not known. The sweet, edible nut matures from September to October of the same year and falls between September and December. Its ellipsoidal shell is thick and hard. Seed production starts when the trees are about 30 years old, and optimum seed-bearing age is 50 to 125 years. Good seed crops are produced every 2 to 3 years. As many as 70 liters (2 bu) can be produced by an open- grown tree. Seeds are disseminated by various methods, including squirrels and water. The seeds of this species germinate from late April to early June. Germination is hypogeal. Burial of seeds by squirrels seems to be important, but it is not necessary for the successful establishment of seedlings. Specific information on the vegetative reproduction of nutmeg hickory is not available. Like other hickories, it probably sprouts readily from small stumps, injured or top-killed seedlings and saplings, and from roots.Boisen, Anton T., and J. A. Newlin. 1910. The commercial hickories. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bulletin 80. Washington, DC. 64 p. Large stumps do not readily sprout, hence the larger the stump, the more likely that it will reproduce only by root suckers. =Sapling and pole stages to maturity= Nutmeg hickory is a medium-sized tree with a tall, straight trunk and stout, slightly spreading branches that form a narrow and rather open crown. It can attain heights of 24 to 30 m (80 to 100 ft) and a diameter of 61 cm (24 in). Although the pecan hickories (which include nutmeg hickory) grow more rapidly than the true hickories,Nelson, Thomas C. 1965. Silvical characteristics of the commercial hickories. USDA Forest Service, Hickory Task Force Report 10. Southeastern Forest Experiment Station, Asheville, NC. 16 p. specific information on the growth rate of nutmeg hickory is lacking. The pecan hickories, in turn, grow more slowly than most other bottom-land hardwoods. The average 10-year diameter increase for hickories in natural, unmanaged stands in the northeast Louisiana delta was 4.3 cm (1.7 in) in the 15- to 30-cm (6- to 12-in) diameter class; 3.3 cm (1.3 in) in the 33- to 48-cm (13- to 19-in) diameter class; and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in the 51- to 71-cm (20- to 28-in) diameter class. Pure stands of nutmeg hickory probably do not exist, and no volume figures are available. Logs and lumber from merchantable nutmeg hickory are sold mixed with other hickories. Rooting Habit- Nutmeg hickory has a strongly developed taproot, especially on well-drained soil. Seedlings of hickory quickly develop a heavy taproot and fine lateral roots. During the pole stage, a robust, spreading lateral root system is developed. Nutmeg hickory is classed as intolerant of shade. It is intolerant as a mature tree, but tolerant in the seedling and sapling stage during which it may survive for a long time in the understory and then respond to release. Any partial cutting system that removes larger, faster-growing competition encourages nutmeg hickory. Fire damages hickory of all ages. A light burn kills the tops of seedlings and saplings; a more intense fire wounds larger trees and provides entry for butt-rotting fungi. Several insects attack hickory but rarely become epidemic.Baker, Whiteford L. 1972. Eastern forest insects. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication 1175. Washington, DC. 642 p. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), walnut caterpillar (Datana integerrima), and walkingstick (Diapheromera femorata) may defoliate individual trees or limbs. Sucking insects, including aphids (Monellia spp.), feed on the underside of leaves, causing them to curl and drop prematurely. The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) may seriously prune seedlings and even large trees by girdling the terminal and branches. The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) can be troublesome during dry years and periods of stress. The ambrosia beetle (Platypus spp. and Xyleborus spp.) and powderpost beetles (Lyctus spp. and Xylobiops basilaris) often cause economic damage to logs and lumber during storage and air-drying. No important diseases of hickory other than a number of wood rots have been reported. Bird peck defect, caused by the yellow-bellied sapsucker, is common and serious in nutmeg hickory. Special uses The nuts of nutmeg hickory are relished by squirrels, which begin cutting them while they are still green.Halls, Lowell K. 1977. Southern fruit-producing woody plants used by wildlife. USDA Forest Service, General Technical Report SO-16. Southern Forest Experiment Station, New Orleans, LA. 235 p. Other rodents and wildlife also eat the nuts. The species is too rare over most of its range to be of major economic importance. The wood of this pecan hickory is slightly inferior in strength and toughness to that of the true or upland hickories, but owing to the small volumes involved and difficulty of distinguishing it from the true hickories, nutmeg hickory is not separated from them during logging. Genetics Nutmeg hickory is a 32 chromosome species that readily hybridizes with other hickory species and was hybridized with pecan by Clinton Graves. Traits such as thin husks with suture wings typical of Apocarya combined with leaf, stem, and bud traits typical of Carya place this species intermediate between the two groups Gallery File:Carya myristiciformis bud.jpgBuds File:Carya myristiciformis (Nutmeg Hickory) (34033288881).jpgBuds File:Carya myristiciformis female flower.jpgFemale flower File:Carya myristiciformis.jpgCatkins of male flowers and emerging leaves File:Carya myristiciformis (Nutmeg Hickory) (36024925876).jpgMaturing fruit References  External links  * Carya myristiciformis images at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Plant Image Database * Halloran, Sean. \\"Collaborating in the Coastal Southeast: A Multi-Institution Expedition along the Coasts of North and South Carolina.\\" Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University website, 31 October 2017.

Early life and career Mills was born in Paris, Illinois to a former teacher and college professor turned insurance salesman. He earned a bachelor's degree in history at Middlebury College in 1966 and a master's degree in American history at Columbia University in 1967. He began his career as a history teacher at the Dalton School in Manhattan, New York City and helped found the Elizabeth Seeger School in 1971. He pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School, graduating in 1975, and an Ed.D. at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1977. He moved to work for the New Jersey Department of Education in the mid-1970s, where he held various administrative posts. Governor Thomas H. Kean picked him to serve as special assistant on education in 1984. In 1988, Governor Madeleine M. Kunin selected him to serve as Commissioner of Education for Vermont. Years as New York Commissioner of Education In 1995, the board of regents appointed him Commissioner of Education for New York State. =Initiatives and State results= Including his calls for high standards. Since 1995 Mills has taken many unprecedented steps including the end of local school boards of education autonomy to grant diplomas through the new mandary Regents Diploma His calls for increased education spending, doubling the amount spend on schools in NY since 1995 with NY now ranked second nationally in educational spending, June 7, unknown year. with the latest spending not accounted for it is expected NY will now be first in per pupil spending. Despite this spending NY's graduation rate is 58%, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the third worst in the nation behind only South Carolina at 54%, and Georgia at 56%. Neighboring Pennsylvania garners 81%. =Roosevelt School takeover= Most troubling is that for the first time the commissioner removed an elected school board for overspending $1.9 million. and having low test scores. In the aftermath of that takeover in 2002 Mills appointed the new superintendent and board of education yet the academic numbers have steadily worsened along with enrollment. Yet in 2007 a state audit now found the school had overspent $12 million.Education Week: When States Seize Schools: A Cautionary Tale After the state brought in report cards six months late, the state refuses to publish the data for Roosevelt Schools. It is the only time the state has refused to publish a report card, even though the district is under direct state control. =Contacts with Public Education= Mills has also drawn calls of hypocrisy: despite his leadership of the NY State Education Department, Mills has never taught in a public school, never been a principal or superintendent in a public school, nor even attended a public school. His only teaching experience comes from the exclusive, private Dalton School. Under Mills' tenure, a series of scandals happened with multiple school districts on Long Island, including contractor lawyers who were being listed as full-time employees by multiple school districts and claiming lucrative public pensions and benefits. He was also criticized for the rampant \\"double dipping\\" practice by school district officials, especially on Long Island. At the top of the list was Mr. James Hunderfund, interim superintendent of Malverne, who was entitled to an annual payment of $516,245 in 2008. Each year, Mr. Mills' department granted one third of all of the waivers of New York states to \\"double dippers\\", people who collects full public pensions and earn more than $30,000 a year. Many times, top level of school district officials are rehired as top level school district officials, even before they are officially retired. =Retirement and death= Mills recently announced that he has prostate cancer. Recent calls by New York State Senate members have been so far unaddressed by Mills. On October 31, 2008, Mills announced he would leave his post in June 2009. He died on November 1, 2017, of a heart attack suffered while hiking in the Adirondack Mountains.

In the third and last phase, completed in September 2013, the remaining 18 wind turbines were installed, bringing the total capacity to around 325 MW.Phase 2 complete  Environmental assessment  To assess the environmental impact C-Power has enlisted the assistance of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO INBO) and the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO ILVO) to obtain the most detailed possible information on the occurrence of these animal species at Thornton Bank and to assess the possible effect of a wind farm on them.Environmental impact How the Wind Farms affect the landscape will be studied by WES-Onderzoek & Advies, who were also involved in earlier research in connection with the perceived impact on the landscape of near shore wind farms. Offshore wind farms may affect sea fishing. Certain areas may be closed to commercial fishing, as a result of which the total area that can be fished is reduced, but new habitats may also be created as a result. The basis for this study is a thorough investigation of the importance of the Thornton Bank for sea fishing. Offshore wind farms create new structures at sea and by definition they therefore pose an additional risk to the safety of shipping. C-Power has, however, chosen a location which is a long way from the most important shipping routes so that this risk can be reduced to a minimum. C-Power will be calling upon the specialised knowledge of German consultants Germanischer Lloyd.  Financing  Thorntonbank was only the second offshore wind farm to be Project Financed.

It is approximately long, draining an area of the Cascade Range southeast of Eugene, which is at the southern end of the Willamette Valley. Course The Middle Fork Willamette River is formed in northeastern Douglas County by the joining of several small headwater streams near Emigrant Pass. The river flows generally north into Lane County, through the Calapooya Mountains, to the vicinity of Eugene and Springfield, where it joins the Coast Fork Willamette River to form the Willamette River proper. Just south (upriver) of Oakridge, the Middle Fork is impounded in Hills Creek Reservoir, created by Hills Creek Dam. Below the dam, the river receives Salt Creek and then Salmon Creek at Oakridge. At Westfir, the Middle Fork is joined by the North Fork Middle Fork Willamette River from the right bank. Below this confluence, the Middle Fork is impounded by two more reservoirs, Lookout Point Reservoir and Dexter Reservoir. Fall Creek enters from the right below Dexter before the Middle Fork joins the Coast Fork in Springfield to form the main stem Willamette River. =Tributaries= Named tributaries from source to mouth are Beaver, Tumblebug, Royal, Fizz, Indigo, Found, Skunk, Swift, Mac, and Echo creeks.

Further downstream are Indian, Dry, Spring Butte, Boulder, Butcherknife, Snake, Fy, Emile, Estep, and Bohemia creeks. Bills, Cone, Buck, Gold, and Windfall creeks are next, followed by a series of streams that enter the river via Hills Creek Reservoir. They are Snow, Coffeepot, Big Willow, Little Willow, Stony, Bull, Packard, Modoc, Larlson, and Hills creeks. Downstream of Hills Lake Reservoir come Salt, Salmon, Shortridge, Gray, Spot, and Chillo creeks, followed by the North Fork Willamette River. Then come Deception, Dell, Buckhead, Bridge, Tire, Whitehead, Rock, and Hospital creeks. Entering the Middle Fork via Lookout Point Reservoir are Duval, Carpet Hill, Schweitzer, South, North, Armet, Harper, Cain, School, Rhodes, Crale, Goodman, Fern, Bannister, Hazel, Rolling Riffle, and Minnow creeks.

Starting in New York City as the brainchild of singer Adam Cohen (who later changed his name to Adam Elk to avoid confusion with Leonard Cohen's son, a musician also named Adam), the band produced a string of quirky and highly inventive releases on various independent labels, most notably Simple Machines. Their music has been compared to XTC. They relocated to San Francisco in 1990. The band signed to Geffen Records in 1997, producing a single album for the label before breaking up in 1998. They reunited to record a new CD in 2008. Jan Kot√≠k, the original drummer for the Mommyheads, died on December 13, 2007, after being ill with cancer for three years. History The first official Mommyheads record, Magumbo Meatpie, was recorded in late 1987. It was released in 1988 on the Sit and Spin label, which was run out of a NYU dorm room. It was produced by Granz Henman, who was attending NYU, and Joseph A. Kim, who was an Ivy League drop-out. The 7\\" vinyl EP featured 4 songs that were recorded by Sonic Youth's engineer Wharton Tiers and is now exceedingly rare. Three of the songs later appeared on the Fang records compilation LP Antipop: New York Underground Mix (1988). This Mommyheads was a quartet, listed as \\"Adam\\" [Cohen], \\"Jan\\" [Kotik], and \\"Jude\\" [Reverly] and \\"Tom\\" [Kotik] on guitar/dulcimer and bass, respectively. Their first full-fledged release was Acorn, on Fang Records in 1989, featuring Cohen (vocals, guitar, other instruments), Jan Kotik (drums), and Matt Patrick (vocals, bass), and produced by Chris Rael (of NYC band Church of Betty). The songwriting was split evenly between Cohen and Patrick. Both of these recordings were released while the band members were still in high school. Rael's liner notes to the Acorn CD re- release allude to XTC, James Brown, and Pussy Galore as primary musical influences. Early 4-track and live demos of Mommyheads songs were released in 1991 or 1992 as the Simple Machines cassette Swiss Army Knife. This collection of home made songs, written and recorded primarily by Adam Cohen, were eccentric but highly original and musically complex. At their core was a whimsical and bittersweet pop sensibility that would underlie most of their subsequent recordings. 4 of the 17 songs would be re-recorded on their \\"official\\" releases. Around this time, Simple Machines also released \\"At the Mall\\" on a 7-inch compilation EP, Pulley. Two tracks appeared on a live Fang Records compilation. Their second \\"real\\" album, the psychedelic Coming Into Beauty, was released on Simple Machines records in 1992. This was a combination of sessions for two albums which followed Acorn,, the first one released informally on a cassette called Papoose. A move to San Francisco and a lineup change occurred during the recording of this CD; Jan Kotik left and was replaced by two members of NYC group the Connotations: Dan Fisherman (drums, backup vocals) and Michael Holt (vocals, keyboards). (Cohen had played percussion on Connotations tracks released on vinyl in 1987, and Holt and Fisherman had also played in a variety of Fang Records bands.) Before the release of the CD, this new lineup released a limited edition live cassette (Mommyheads Live) of a more recent batch of songs, on Fang Records, most of which never made it to their later CD releases. Matt Patrick left and was replaced by bass player Jeff Palmer (formerly of Sister Double Happiness), around the time of the recording of the next CD, Flying Suit, in 1994 (Dromedary Records). Liner notes to the Tiny Idols compilation credit \\"the slick, professionally minded Jeff Palmer\\" with steering the band towards a more \\"mainstream\\" sound at roughly this point.Tiny Idols compilation (Snowglobe Records; 2005) Live performances from this period, especially in college settings, often included a fetid, bongwater-soaked towel. Songwriting duties shifted mostly to Cohen, with occasional contributions from Holt. Several singles and compilation songs were released in this period, as well. A fourth record, Bingham's Hole, was released on Dot Dot Dash records in 1995. Produced by Peter Katis,Tarquin Records: Tape-Op ‚Äì Sept/Oct 2002 this was the band's final independent full-length recording, and it showed the band adding more funk and boogie elements into the mix. Bingham's Hole drew the attention of Don Was who was credited with producing their next record. On the strength of Bingham's Hole, the band was signed to Geffen Records, which released the Beatle-esque The Mommyheads in 1997. The CD met with mixed reviews. The band was dropped during a label shake-up before the album was even released, and the album was barely promoted. The Mommyheads broke up shortly thereafter, playing their final show in San Francisco in February 1998. Many fans hold this as a perfect example of a major label \\"ruining\\" a band that had established critical success and a solid fan base with the quality of its independent recordings and excellent live shows. Following the breakup, most members of the band have gone on to solo and other collaborative projects. Adam Elk released a solo album called Labello, and is now a successful composer for television commercials. Jeff Palmer joined Sub Pop band Sunny Day Real Estate and Granfaloon Bus. Michael Holt has gone on to record several solo albums. Dan Fisherman became a computer programmer for a small San Francisco computer company and teaches mathematics, philosophy and recording for the Randolph School in Wappingers Falls, New York Mommyheads songs have been covered on record by Jenny Toomey (\\"Needmore, PA\\" on Antidote) and Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin (\\"Accident\\" and \\"Cora,\\" the latter on the EP Someone Still Loves You Michael Holt). Following the death of original drummer, Jan Kotik, The Mommyheads re-united for a tribute show in New York City. Shortly after, they decided to reform and record a new album, You're Not A Dream, which was released in 2008. In the spring of 2010, the band released a remastered version of Flying Suit containing three bonus tracks recorded during the same era. The Mommyheads are featured in a 2010 Time Warner Cable television ad for the company's broadband internet offerings. They jam out together all from different locations via the internet. In 2010, Jason McNair joined the band on bass guitar , replacing Jeff Palmer. A retrospective album entitled \\"Finest Specimens\\" was released on the Dromedary Records label on Oct 19, 2010. The album contained cuts from most of the band's studio albums as well as previously unreleased live tracks, demos, and one new song. Their 2011 release, Delicate Friction, was the band's first record of all-new material since the mid-1990s. In the spring of 2012, the band announced the release of Vulnerable Boy on Dromedary Records in North America and Europe, and on Dead Frog Records in Scandinavia. This Burst of activity coincided with 3 well attended tours of Scandinavia and Northern Europe In 2018, The Mommyheads released \\"Soundtrack to the World's End,\\" an album with several songs about the quickly approaching time of social, ecological, and economic crisis. It peaked in the top 20 of the sub-modern radio charts in December 2018 and was well reviewed by press. In 2019 , The Mommyheads released \\"Future You\\" on their own label in the US and Fanar records in Scandinavia https://www.facebook.com/fanfar.se/ The record peaked on the NCAA college radio charts at #85 and the Sub Modern Charts at #40 and was well reviewed by press. The band embarked on a 9 city tour of Scandinavia in Sept of 2019. In 2020 , The Mommyheads Re-Released their Self Titled 97' Major Label Record. It was the 14th most added LP in College Radio in mid-Feb 2020 and was called \\"Their Masterpiece\\" by Big Takeover Magazine in the Spring 2020 ISSUE. The LP eventually peaked at #120 on College radio which coincided with Adam doing an extensive radio interview tour.

The school offers an SAT prep course program and a variety of Advance Placement (AP) college courses that you can apply for starting in 10th grade. It is also one of the first high schools in Harlem to make wearing a uniform in a public school mandatory (compulsory) but not enforced. History Frederick Douglass Academy was created in 1991 by Dr. Lorraine Monroe (a former Deputy Chancellor of Instruction for the New York City Board of Education) and several other members of the New York City Board of Education. The founding principal was Monroe, who left in 1997 and was succeeded briefly by Dorothy Haime prior to the appointment of Dr. Gregory Hodge in 1997. Hodge remained in the position until his retirement in 2011, to be succeeded by Joseph Gates. Ayisha Fullerton became principal in 2017, replacing Joseph Gates who stepped down in June 2017. Academics Frederick Douglass Academy is a college preparatory school that stresses academic achievement. It offers Advanced Placement courses which allows students to receive college credit. Some of these AP courses offered are: * Psychology * Biology * Calculus AB * Chemistry * English Language * English Literature * European History * French Language * Micro-economics * Physics C: Mechanics * Spanish Language * Statistics * U.S. History * Government & Politics The school showed a 94% graduation rate giving FDA an \\"A\\" rating for College and Career Readiness on the 2012-2013 NYC Progress Report. It was a Daily News \\"top high school,\\" in 2012. Extracurricular activities Frederick Douglass Academy offers a few extracurricular activities ranging from an anime interest club to robotics. As of 2010, it offers the following among many other activities: * Anime club * Chess club * History club * Yearbook committee * Buildon - This club (not created at FDA) focuses on local community service simultaneously with building schools in third-world nations such as Nicaragua and Ghana. On average, two or three students go abroad to these countries to help build the schools from scratch with money raised locally. * Robotics - FDA linked up with For Inspiration and Recognition of Technology (FIRST) robotics league. The inception of the school's chapter‚Äîin 2005‚Äîproved to be remarkable as the team finished in second place, displacing Stuyvesant High School and Bronx Science. * School newspaper club In 2006 FDA students launched The North Star school newspaper named after Frederick Douglass' newspaper. Varsity sports * Football (M) * Baseball (M) * Basketball * Indoor Track * Lacrosse * Outdoor Track * Soccer (M) * Softball (F) * Tennis * Taekwondo * Fencing Partnerships Frederick Douglass Academy's business partnerships include a variety of companies. * HBO‚ÄîThe HBO mentoring program in FDA is an important asset to the school as it pairs high school students with HBO employees. In such manner, students gain insight to the professional world and receive advise such as how to write a resume or prepare for a college interview. * Gap‚ÄîThe Little Shop of Scholars is FDA's school store‚Äîaffiliated with Gap‚Äîwhich has everything from school uniforms to holiday gifts. The merchandise are gifts from Gap. The monetary proceeds go to graduating seniors in the form of scholarships. *Harlem Children Society‚ÄîThis program partners FDA with Harlem Children Society‚Äîindirectly with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the renowned cancer research institution. FDA students part of the program are able to be paired up with research mentors and are placed in research labs. Students take part in research ranging from nutrition to neurology. This program gives students who have an interest in science and medicine a great hands-on experience. Students involved in the past have been able to assume important roles in the lab as they have done tasks ranging from performing perfusions on lab mice to DNA ligations. * Columbia University‚ÄîAs a college preparatory school, FDA spends a great deal of effort in providing SAT-prep courses catered mostly to juniors and seniors. With Columbia University, the school has a Let's Get Ready chapter. The program has been proven effective as it generally increases the students' SAT scores by placing the students in appropriate groups that target the students' specific problems, be it math or the verbal section. * The New York Times‚ÄîEvery year a senior is offered a scholarship for outstanding scholarly articles awarded by a New York Times affiliate. Thus, seniors are motivated each year to compile their most outstanding written pieces in hope of winning the prestigious scholarship. * Sullivan & Cromwell‚ÄîThis partnership is a very fundamental one given that the law-firm company is the main provider of Advanced Placement- course textbooks. * Futures and Options‚ÄîThis nonprofit organization serves as an umbrella to several other programs in the school as it offers \\"paid semester internships at private sector and not-for-profit sites in the city.\\" Legacy Based on the success of Monroe's original model, the New York City school system created seven other \\"Frederick Douglass Academies\\" around the city: *Frederick Douglass Academy II Secondary School (Manhattan) (H.S.

There is a 19th century record of water from Bullen Merri overflowing into Gnotuk. Inside the crater of Gnotuk is Camperdown's sporting grounds. There is a 18 hole golf course, two cricket ovals (one is turf), and an equestrian course for horse enthusiasts. The crater is 2 km across and although the lakes have the same level of their lake-beds the level of water is lower in Gnotuk. Lake shore terraces indicate previous higher levels and lake floor sediments and fossils show a record of past fluctuations in salinity, water level and climate.http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/DPI/Vro/coranregn.nsf/pages/corangamite_eruption_points_gnotuk There is no direct public access to the water edge of the lake.

It was the band's third and final album, as their disbanding was announced shortly before its release. The album is noteworthy in that three of its four songs were not released in studio versions by the band. Specifically: * \\"Play with Fire\\" is a cover version of a song originally written and performed by The Rolling Stones, although West, Bruce and Laing's rendition uses the music for \\"Love is Worth the Blues,\\" a song they previously wrote and recorded for their 1972 Why Dontcha debut album. * \\"Politician\\" is a cover of a song Jack Bruce originally wrote and performed with his previous band Cream. * \\"Powerhouse Sod\\" is a previously-unreleased song featuring a bass guitar solo by Bruce. While credited to West, Bruce and Laing, Jack Bruce is probably the song's primary author, as the song had been played by Bruce with other bands prior to West, Bruce and Laing (for example, a live recording of it from 1971 is included on Jack Bruce's Spirit (Live at the BBC 1971‚Äì1978) boxed set).

Since its invention in 1843, the euphonium has always had an important role in ensembles, but solo literature was slow to appear, consisting of only a handful of lighter solos until the 1960s. Since then, however, the breadth and depth of the solo euphonium repertoire has increased dramatically.  Ensemble repertoire  = In bands = Historically Upon its invention by Ferdinand Sommer of Weimar, it was clear that the euphonium, compared to its predecessors the serpent and ophicleide, had a wide range and a consistently rich, pleasing sound throughout that range. It was flexible both in tone quality and intonation and could blend well with a variety of ensembles, earning it immediate popularity with composers and conductors as the principal tenor-voiced solo instrument in brass band settings, especially in Britain. When British composers who had written for brass bands began to turn their attention to the concert band in the early twentieth century, they used the euphonium in a very similar role. Gustav Holst, for example, wrote very important solos for the euphonium in his first (1909) and second (1911) suites for band, and similar lyrical solos appear in many pieces from the 1920s and '30s by Percy Grainger and Ralph Vaughan Williams. When American composers also started writing for the concert band as its own artistic medium in the 1930s and '40s, they continued the British tradition of using the euphonium as one of the principal solo voices. Arnold Schoenberg's Theme and Variations and Samuel Barber's Commando March, both from 1943, have extremely prominent, lyrical solos for euphonium; Robert Russell Bennett's Suite of Old American Dances (1949) has brief solos and very active technical writing, and \\"When Jesus Wept,\\" the second movement of William Schuman's New England Triptych (1956) is largely a euphonium solo and lyrical duet for euphonium and cornet (arranged by the composer from the orchestral original which features bassoon and oboe). All of these pieces are still in the core repertoire of the concert band today, and these solos comprise the core body of euphonium excerpts. Today This is not to say that composers, then and now, valued the euphonium only for its lyrical capabilities. Indeed, examination of a large body of concert band literature reveals that the euphonium functions as a jack of all trades, at times doubling the tuba in octaves, at times adding warmth to the trombone section, at times adding depth to a horn line, and at times adding strength to rapid woodwind lines. In general, idiomatic euphonium parts tend to be very active, resting little and covering a wide range. In many ways, the role of the euphonium in concert band writing has not changed very much in the last several decades; as a solo instrument, it is still as popular with composers as ever, and it still continues in its versatile, jack-of-all- trades role. The influence of the brass band tradition in euphonium writing is evident in the many euphonium solos in both brass band and concert band pieces by British composers Peter Graham, John Golland, Martin Ellerby, Philip Sparke and Gareth Wood; among contemporary American band composers, Robert W. Smith, David Maslanka, David Gillingham, Eric Whitacre, and James Curnow especially seem to enjoy using the euphonium as a solo instrument. The Gareth Wood concerto can be heard at https://archive.org/details/EuphoniumConcerto2006GarethWoodWorldPremierecompleteDr.Stephen = In orchestras = Although the deficiencies of the ophicleide gave rise to both the euphonium and the tuba in the mid-nineteenth century, the tuba has long since been accepted as an orchestral instrument, while the euphonium never has been. Though the euphonium was embraced from its earliest days by composers and arrangers in band settings, orchestral composers have generally not taken advantage of its capabilities. Nevertheless, there are several orchestral works, a few of which are in the standard repertoire, in which composers have called for a tenor tuba, a German Tenorhorn¬π, a Wagner tuba, or a French tuba in C. Don Quixote's faithful companion Sancho Panza, portrayed by a euphonium in Richard Strauss's eponymous tone poem. In all of these cases, the composer's desired effect was that of tenor-voiced, valved brass instrument ‚Äì and in many of these cases the euphonium is substituted for the called-for instrument, either because the instrument is obsolete (French C tuba), is unavailable (tenor tuba), or may be undesirable (Wagner tuba). Chief among these examples are the tone poems Don Quixote (1897) and Ein Heldenleben (1898) by Richard Strauss, which were originally scored for Wagner tuba, but after their performance on Wagner tuba proved unsatisfactory, were rescored for euphonium with Strauss's approval. In the first movement of his Seventh Symphony (1906), Gustav Mahler wrote an extremely prominent solo for Tenorhorn¬π. Gustav Holst used a tenor tuba in three movements (Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus) of his suite The Planets (1914‚Äì16). Finally, Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's most famous piece Sinfonietta employs two euphonium parts. Another popular piece by Jan√°ƒçek, Capriccio, employs a prominent euphonium part throughout. Today, all of these parts are customarily played on euphonium, and in each of these cases, the instrument called for is used in both a soloistic role and written to function as part of the brass section. In addition, a number of British composers in the pre-World War II era, including Ralph Vaughan Williams, Percy Grainger, and Arnold Bax, wrote orchestral pieces with two tuba parts, understanding that the first part would be played on euphonium. Finally, there are several orchestral pieces ‚Äì though none in the standard repertoire ‚Äì in which the composer specifically calls for a euphonium. Among them are Dmitri Shostakovich's score to the ballet The Golden Age, Leonard Bernstein's Divertimento for Orchestra, and several symphonies by the British composer Havergal Brian, the American Roy Harris, and the still-living Finnish composer Kalevi Aho. ¬πThis is not same as the English \\"tenor horn,\\" but rather closer to the baritone horn.  List of orchestral works  Following is a partial list of orchestral works which employ a euphonium (German: \\"Tenortuba\\" or \\"Tenorhorn\\") * B√©la Bart√≥k - Kossuth (2 B tenor tubas) * Paul Creston - Chthonic Ode \\"Homage to Henry Moore\\" for large orchestra with euphonium, celesta and piano, Op. 90 (1966) * Karlheinz Essl, Jr. - Si! for tenor tuba (or trombone), live-electronics and surround sound (2012) * Roy Harris - When Johnny Comes Marching Home (B baritone) * Gustav Holst - Mars, Jupiter and Uranus from The Planets (B tenor tuba) * Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek - Capriccio (B tenor tuba) * Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek - Sinfonietta (2 B tenor tubas) * Giselher Klebe - Opera The Murder of Caesar (B Tenortuba) * Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g - Stele (2 B tenor tubas) * Luigi Nono - Prometeo * Dmitri Shostakovich - The Golden Age * Richard Strauss - Don Quixote (B Tenortuba) * Richard Strauss - Ein Heldenleben (B Tenortuba)  Solo repertoire  In contrast to the long-standing practice of extensive euphonium use in wind bands and orchestras, until approximately forty years ago there was literally no body of solo literature written specifically for the euphonium, and euphoniumists were forced to borrow the literature of other instruments. Fortunately, given the instrument's multifaceted capabilities discussed above, solos for many different instruments are easily adaptable to performance on the euphonium. = Transcriptions = The most common sources of transcriptions for euphonium are the cornet, vocal, cello, bassoon and trombone repertoires. In each case, one can see the common threads of ease of reading and performance: cello and bassoon both customarily read in bass clef, making them easily adaptable; vocal solos are naturally suited to the singing quality of the euphonium; and in playing cornet solos the euphonist may use the same fingerings that a cornettist would. Cornet Probably the earliest solos played on euphonium were cornet transcriptions, especially variations on popular airs, such as those found at the back of Jean-Baptiste Arban's Complete Method for Cornet. A little later, in the early twentieth century, the American cornettist Herbert L. Clarke wrote a body of virtuosic solos, including Carnival of Venice, Bride of the Waves, and From the Shores of the Mighty Pacific, that were and still are often performed on euphonium. In such cases, no adaptation or arrangement is necessary; a euphoniumist reads the original notation in B-flat treble clef, transposing down a major ninth, and performs the piece exactly as written, merely sounding an octave below the cornet. Vocal The large body of operatic arias, especially those for tenor or baritone, also provides an ideal source of literature for euphoniumists. Puccini's Vissi d'Arte and Nessun Dorma are often performed on euphonium, and Germanic art songs, such as Schumann's Dichterliebe or Brahms's Vier ernste Ges√§nge, are also popular transcriptions, as is Rachmaninoff's Vocalise Op. 34 no. 14. In performing vocal transcriptions, some adaptation may be necessary, either because the tessitura is uncomfortably high or because the original key may present fingering or intonation problems. Despite the prevalence of vocal transcriptions for euphonium, there remains much vocal work that is rarely, if ever, performed on euphonium, including Spanish, French, and German opera arias. The possibility of performing choral music in a euphonium ensemble is also intriguing, but not often seen. Bach cello suite in G major; the six Bach cello suites are often performed on euphonium. Cello and bassoon Another source of transcribed literature lies in the cello repertoire. Johann Sebastian Bach's six cello suites are a cornerstone of the euphonium's advanced repertoire and have been for some time; Leonard Falcone recorded two of the bourrees several decades ago in the first volume of his \\"Leonard Falcone and his Baritone\\" series. Two other cello pieces that are commonly played on euphonium are Benedetto Marcello's Sonata in F Major, from the Baroque era, and Julius Klengel's Concertino in C Major from the Romantic era. Of course, some adaptation is necessary when performing cello pieces, especially in the case of multiple stops and arpeggiated chords, as well as when considering the ease of technique in certain keys for cello as opposed to euphonium. A few bassoon pieces are regularly performed on euphonium as well, including Mozart's Concerto in B-flat Major K. 191 and Georg Philipp Telemann's Sonata in F Minor. Some pieces work the other way round, including Joseph Horowitz's Euphonium Concerto, which is often played on bassoon. Other Recently, there have been attempts at playing more exotic pieces that are much more difficult to adapt for euphonium, as seen in Japanese euphonist Shoichiro Hokazono's recording of Astor Piazzolla's Six Tango Etudes, originally written for flute, and which, even transposed down a major ninth, pose severe range and technical difficulties for euphonium. = Original literature = French Conservatoire One area of literature in which transcriptions and original literature coincide is what could be called the \\"French Conservatoire\\" style of writing,¬π dating roughly from the first half of the twentieth century and best exemplified by the composer Joseph Eduard Barat (1882‚Äì1963). Some of the pieces in this school were written specifically for trombone, such as Barat's Andante and Allegro (1935) and Alexandre Guilmant's Mor√ßeau Symphonique (c. 1937), some for trombone or euphonium, such as Paul Veronge de la Nux's Concert Piece (1900), some for euphonium or tuba, such as Barat's Introduction and Dance, and at least one specifically for euphonium, Barat's Mor√ßeau de Concours (1957). ¬πSo called because many of the pieces in this style were either written for professors at the French Conservatoire National de Musique, or were written as contest or instructional pieces to be used for students at the Conservatoire. Early 20th century virtuoso Amilcare Ponchielli, composer of the first original euphonium solo The earliest surviving solo composition written specifically for euphonium or one of its saxhorn cousins is the Concerto per Flicorno Basso (1872) by Amilcare Ponchielli. Quite demanding technically, the piece mixes the styles of the Italian opera overture and of the quintessential nineteenth- century theme and variations. Following this, for several decades the only literature written specifically for euphonium was in the same virtuosic technical style as the cornet solos described above. Falling under this category would be Joseph Deluca's Beautiful Colorado (1924), Simone Mantia's Fantasia Originale (1909), and Eduardo Boccalari's Fantasia di Concerto (1906). In the 1930s, many Euphonium solos were released in various band journals, in classic \\"theme and variations\\" setting were such classics as, The Song of the Brother (Leizden), Song of Faith (Ball), Ransomed (Marshall), and We'll All Shout Hallelujah (Audoire), as well as many others. The new style While British composers may have led the way in writing for euphonium in an ensemble setting, it was Americans who wrote the first of the \\"new school\\" of serious, artistic solo works written specifically for euphonium. The first two examples are Warner Hutchison's Sonatina (1966) and Donald White's Lyric Suite (1970), after which British composers followed suit with Joseph Horovitz's Concerto (1972, one of the first euphonium concertos) and Gordon Jacob's Fantasia (1973). Two early very difficult works are Samuel Adler's Four Dialogues (for euphonium and marimba, 1974) and Jan Bach's Concert Variations (1978), both premiered by Dr. Brian Bowman. Two of the first unaccompanied solos for euphonium are the Mazurka (1964) by Nicholas Falcone, brother of early euphonium virtuoso Leonard Falcone, and the Sonata (1978) by Fred Clinard, Jr. All of these works remain basic repertoire for the euphonium. Today Since then, there has been a virtual explosion of solo repertoire for the euphonium; in a mere four decades, the solo literature has expanded from virtually zero to thousands of pieces as more and more composers have become aware of the instrument's soloistic capabilities. The euphonium literature from the past three decades has constantly \\"pushed the envelope\\" in terms of tessitura, endurance, technical demands, and extended techniques. To give only a few examples, James Curnow's Symphonic Variants (1984), now one of the classics of the literature, set new standards of range for the time, encompassing both D1 and F5. Roland Szentpali's Pearls (2000), written in a jazz/rock idiom, also uses a very high tessitura and contains extreme technical demands, while John Stevens' unaccompanied piece Soliloquies (2001) includes many wide leaps in range, both slurred and articulated. Another segment of the avant-garde solo literature consists of those works for euphonium and recorded accompaniment, going all the way back to 1970, with John Boda's Sonatina for Baritone Horn and Tape. Since then, Neal Corwell, a euphonium performer as well as composer, has contributed many additional solos with synthesized, recorded accompaniment, beginning with Odyssey (1990). On the other hand, British composer Philip Sparke has written numerous euphonium solos (e.g. Pantomime, Song for Ina, Harlequin) of a much lighter nature, though no less technically demanding. Unique works such as the war protest piece One of the Missing (for those lost in Iraq - 2007) have also brought the instrument forward to be used in a more divergent and compelling way. There is a great lack in chamber music for euphonium (where it is not the exclusive soloist). Di√°logo Sonoro ao Luar or \\"Moonlight Dialogue\\" for Alto Saxophone and Euphonium is a very unique work written by one of the main 20th c. Brazilian composers Francisco Braga (published in 1946). Besides its unique instrumentation it displays techanical and lyrical qualities of the both modern sax and euphonium at the time. A Although this, in the last years, more authors compose camera music with euphonium. Elaine Fine composed a sonata for euphonium, ranging 2.5 octaves, the Israeli composer, Tamara Hiskia, created several pieces for euphonium which recall pioneer techniques; Rhapsody and Fugue on Classical Themes (2014, 2016) for Trumpet, Horn, Euphonium and Tuba, Variations on a Theme by Paganini (la Campanella) in A Flat Minor (2015) for Euphonium and Piano, Ballade \\"Genius and Fate\\" (2015) for Euphonium and Piano, Trio (2014, 2017) for Bb Clarinet, Euphonium or Bassoon and Piano. The ranges in the compositions are between 3 (Ballade) to 4.5 octaves (Trio). All these pieces require high level of technique and musicality. The use of euphonium as a solo instrument with orchestral accompaniment still remains limited. The earliest known composition of this type is Alan Hovhaness' Concerto No. 3 (\\"Diran, the Religious Singer\\") from 1948. Subsequent pieces include Rule Beasley's Concerto (1967), Hovhaness' Symphony No. 29 (1976), and the David Gaines Concerto (1987). Since then, an increasing number of professionally written concerti for euphonium and orchestra have appeared, including those by Jan Bach (1990), Jukka Linkola (1996), Vladimir Cosma (1997), Torstein Aagaard-Nilsen (2000), Alun Hoddinott (2002), Juraj Filas (2003), Uljas Pulkkis (2004), Kevin Hill (2004), John Stevens (2004), Rolf Rudin (2007), Lee Bracegirdle (2007), Tim Jansa (2009), and Karl Jenkins (2009). Non- traditional settings Thanks to a handful of enterprising individuals, in recent years the euphonium has begun to make inroads in jazz, pop and other non-concert performance settings. One of these individuals was Rich Matteson (1929‚Äì1993), who viewed himself primarily as a jazz musician who simply happened to play the euphonium. Together with two other euphoniums and three tubas and a rhythm section, he formed the Tubajazz Consort, which appeared in jazz clubs and at conferences worldwide to great acclaim. Today, jazz euphoniumists such as Marc Dickman carry on Matteson's legacy, and jazz euphonium competitions are held around the world. The instrument is an essential part of the development of typical music genres in South America. The \\"Bombardino\\" is a truly star in Colombian genres such as the Porro or the Fandango. The living master of typical Colombian euphonium is Ram√≥n Benitez. In Brazil, the instrument is part of the development of the very first typical music genre in Brazil, the Choro (from 19th century onwards). Choro is a virtuoso and counterpointing instrumental genre of light music, called sometimes as \\"street chamber music\\". In addition, euphoniumists like Lance LaDuke and Matthew Murchison have recently explored and recorded the euphonium in non-traditional performance situations. LaDuke, in his CD Take a Walk, uses euphonium in a variety of quasi-country, comedic song settings as well as in his recording of Sam Pilafian's Relentless Grooves: Armenia, which uses a pre- recorded accompaniment and treats the solo euphonium almost as an Armenian folk instrument. Murchison has released a recording of traditional euphonium repertoire but has also formed, along with his wife and others, the world music group Mainspring, in which, Murchison's website says, \\"A typical concert may consist of traditional jigs and reels from Scotland and Ireland, beautiful Mexican serenades, sambas, a suite of Spanish folk music, an Armenian lament, entertaining original music, and always plenty of light-hearted fun!\\" References Category:Compositions by instrumentation Category:Brass instruments ","title":"Euphonium repertoire"},{"id":"11795089","text":"Rwanda's legal system is largely based on German and Belgian civil law systems and customary law.

It is the largest sum and sum centre in Zavkhan aimag after its capital, Uliastai.  Geography  Founded in 1923, Tosontsengel sum is located in the northeastern part of Zavkhan province. It is bordered by Ider, Ikh-Uul, Otgon, and Telmen sums of Zavkhan province; Tsetserleg sum of Khuvsgul province; and Tsakhir sum of Arkhangai province. The Ider River divides Tosontsengel into two parts.The southern part of the sum is located at the head of the Tarvagatai mountain range, a branch of the Khangai Mountains, which belongs to the forest steppe and steppe zone. The main part of the Khangai Mountains occupies most of the sum.  Climate  Tosontsengel has a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dwc) with mild summers and bitterly cold winters. The average minimum temperature in January is , and temperatures as low as have been recorded. Most precipitation falls in the summer as rain, with some snow in the adjacent months of May and September. Winters are very dry. The wind causes the snow to drift, making it difficult for the nomadic herders to keep their animals alive. = Barometric pressure record = The highest barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth was , measured in Tosontsengel on 19 December 2001.  Population  The population of Tosontsengel is about 9,000. The population of the sum center is about 920 families (about 5,000 people) in winter and about 680 in summer. There are two schools (elementary through high school), a trade school, and a hospital in the sum center. Outside of the main sum are two large fields owned by a foreigner, Tom Phillips, which provide most of the vegetables for the town.  Economy  In the socialist period Tosontsengel was one of the largest timber processing centres in Mongolia. A new small hydropower station was built on the Ider close to the sum centre. Most residents are nomadic herders moving between their summer locations, often by a river, to their Uveljus (winter homes) to protect their animals from the harsh Mongolia winter. The people who live in the sum center operate stores, drive trucks, or leave to mine in the summer months. As the nomadic lifestyle becomes more difficult, more young people are leaving the sum for the capital city to attend university and find jobs.  Transportation  Tosontsengel sum has relatively good road connections to Uliastai city (), M√∂r√∂n city (), Tsetserleg city (), and Ulaangom city (); and to the Russian border crossing () and the Russian cities Kyzyl (Tyva respublic) and Krasnoyarsk (Krasnoyarsk Krai). There is a small airport called Tosontsengel Airport in the sum centre. It is located on the right bank of the Ider. The airport has not been used often since 2007, with the main users being a medical airplane flown by Blue Sky and the annual crop duster plane that has been combatting the moths that are destroying the forests.

He was a member of the aristocratic Immedinger family and was granted his see on the understanding that his property would pass to the diocese on his death. He is known as \\"the Second Founder of Paderborn\\". In 1014 and 1015, Meinwerk had two meetings with the Emperor Henry II to urge the continued reform of Corvey Abbey. In 1017, he won a dispute with the Ekkehardinger over the rights to Helmarshausen Abbey. A gathering of nobles under the king declared in his favour, though the sources give differing reasons for this. The most likely explanation appears be that because Helmarshausen was too poor to provide the proper servitium regis to the king and because it lay within the diocese of Paderborn, which meant the bishop already had episcopal responsibility for it, it made sense to make a formal grant of it to the bishopric so that the bishop could more effectively protect it. Meinwerk was highly suspicious of Haimerad, a well-known wandering hermit of unfree origins, and had him arrested and beaten, and his prayer-book burnt. Meinwerk's competence in Latin is questionable. He was the butt of a practical joke by Emperor Henry II, who altered the words famulis et famulabis, meaning \\"male and female servants,\\" to mulis et mulabis, \\"male and female mules,\\" in a liturgical manuscript, which the bishop nevertheless read out loud without noticing anything amiss. The Vita Meinwerci is a biography of him and his times. His liturgical commemoration is listed for June 5.http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-meinwerk-of-paderborn/ References Sources *Reuter, Timothy, 1991: Germany in the Early Middle Ages 800-1056\\\\.

It is now part of AQA. History =Formation= The AEB was formed in 1953 to offer GCE (O Level and A Level) qualifications. It was founded by City & Guilds, making it the only exam board based in England not linked to a university. =Collaboration= By the 1970s, the UK's Department for Education and Science became increasingly committed to replacing GCE O Level and CSE exams with a single exam (later named the GCSE), which it wished to be administered by regional consortia of existing O Level and CSE exam boards. Therefore, AEB joined with other the three CSE examination boards in southern England ‚Äì the South-East Regional Examinations Board, the Southern Regional Examinations Board and the South Western Examinations Board ‚Äì to form a joint working group in 1978. The University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations joined the group in 1981. Despite the plans for GCSE, the AEB (and the Oxford Delegacy) would continue to offer A Levels independently. The three CSE boards, however, would now only offer qualifications as part of the group. Therefore, the CSE boards pursued merging with the GCE boards. Consequently, the South East and South Western boards merged with the AEB in 1985 and 1987 respectively (meanwhile, the Southern Board merged with the Oxford Delegacy in 1985 to form the Oxford School Examinations Board). This left the Associated Examining Board and the Oxford School Examinations Board as the only members of their local GCSE group, which they formally launched as the Southern Examining Group in 1987 in time for the first GCSE exams in 1988. =Final years= In 1994, the University of Oxford decided to exit the schools examinations market and sold its share of the Southern Examining Group to the AEB (its A Level interests transferred to the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate). Thus, the Associated Examining Board now controlled the Southern Examining Group entirely. The AEB retained the SEG's identity, meaning GCSEs continued to be offered under the SEG brand and A Levels under the AEB name. Though legally the AEB owned the SEG, both names were used equally, with the organisation often referred to as the Associated Examining Board and Southern Examining Group (AEB/SEG). In 1997, AEB/SEG entered into an alliance with two other exam boards, NEAB and City & Guilds, known as the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA). The 1998 examination certificates featured just the AQA name. By 1999, examination papers were dual-branded with both the AQA and AEB or SEG names. In 2000, AEB/SEG and NEAB (but not City & Guilds) formally merged under the name AQA and the AEB and SEG names disappeared entirely. As AEB/SEG and NEAB overlapped in the qualifications they offered, AQA retained two specifications for many subjects, with schools able to choose between the two.

AllAfrica (first written by Moses Moyo on 7 June, last updated on 10 June) According to the government, the soldiers planned on forcibly removing President Robert Mugabe from office and asking Rural Housing Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa to form a government with the heads of the armed forces. The government first heard of the plot when a former army officer who opposed the coup contacted the police in Paris, France, giving them a map and a list of those involved. Mnangagwa and State Security Minister Didymus Mutasa both said they did not know about the plot, Mnangagwa calling it \\"stupid.\\"Allegations of coup plot in Zimbabwe , June 15, 2007. Mail and Guardian Online Some analysts have speculated that rival successors to Mugabe, such as former Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army leader Solomon Mujuru, were possibly trying to discredit Mnangagwa. Gilbert Kagodora, treasurer for the Movement for Democratic Change political party in Mashonaland Central, said he and Matapo were arrested by men whom he suspected work for the Central Intelligence Organization at 2:PM on May 29 in Harare.Zimbabwe: Alleged coup plotter speaks out AllAfrica Kagodora said he and Matapo were put in a basement where he believed Military Intelligence Unit officials tortured him, using electrical rods to elicit confessions. Interrogators asked about MDC terror camps in South Africa, leaders and financiers of the plot, petrol bombers in the MDC, and the Democratic Resistance Committee. On June 1 Kagodora came into the custody of the Law and Order section at Harare Central Police Station. He said he heard interrogators asking Matapo to reveal the names of army and police officers with ties to the coup d'√©tat. Police released Kagadora on June 4. Charges and aftermath Several men, either on active duty or retired from the Zimbabwe National Army, were arrested between May 29 and early June. They were present in secret court hearings twice in which family members and journalists were not allowed to attend. The case was heard by the High Court. Prosecutors accuse Albert Matapo of leading the coup and trying to \\"recruit as many soldiers as possible to take over the government and all camps and be in control of the nation after which he will announce to the nation that he was in control of government and would invite Minister Mnangagwa and service chiefs to form a government.\\" Albert Rugowe, formerly an officer in the army, was accused of recruiting military officials for the coup. Captain Shepherd Maromo and Olivine Morale were also on trial. According to a military source in Harare, the coup leaders allegedly contacted Western governments and asked them if they would support the coup. \\"The general feedback was that the western countries would publicly condemn the coup and privately support it only if it would restore democracy in Zimbabwe.\\" Treason charges were laid against Matapo and other civilians, but no treason trial ever took place, for lack of evidence. However seven men, former Army Captain Albert Matapo (who had retired from the army 16 years earlier in 1991), and six others, Emmanuel Marara, Oncemore Mudzurahona, Partson Mupfure, Nyasha Zivuku, Rangarirai Mazivofa and Shingirai Webster Mutemachani, ended up spending seven years in Chikurubi Prison, before being released on March 1, 2014. Matapo claimed they were severely tortured during interrogation, including electrocution to the genitals. He said they were not attempting a coup, and had no interest in supporting Mnangagwa (whom he deemed as bad as Mugabe, and potentially even worse than him), but were simply trying to form a political party, now called United Crusade for Achieving Democracy (UCAD), which was eventually launched by them in Harare on August 1, 2014.

The Force Publique were split into garrison and territorial troops after World War I, with the territorial troops primarily responsible for internal security. In 1959, the territorial troops effectively became the gendarmerie, and by independence in 1960 there were three police forces: the gendarmerie, the local police, and the Chief's Police (collectivity police).International Crisis Group, Security Sector Reform in the Congo, Africa Report No. 104, 13 February 2006, p.4 In 1972 ‚Äì Decrees 72-031 dated 31 July and 72-041 dated 30 August ‚Äì Mobutu merged the primarily urban Zairian (formerly Congolese) National Police and the gendarmes (largely rural) into a unified organisation, the Gendarmerie Nationale (GDN).

It is better known by its acronym, ANUSA. ANUSA acts as a representative body for the undergraduate students of the Australian National University, while also providing a number of goods and services to those students. Not to be confused with ANU Union, a not-for- profit association that once managed retail operations in the former ANU Union Building. The Postgraduate and Research Students' Association acts in an equal capacity to ANUSA at the Australian National University as a representative body for graduate students.  Objective  The objectives of the Australian National University Student Association are: * To promote the welfare of, and further the interests of, undergraduate students * To work for quality and equity in higher education * To afford a recognised means of representation for undergraduate students within the university and the wider community * To foster community, equity and diversity within the universityhttps://anusa.com.au/pageassets/about/anusa/constitution/ANUSA- Consitution-and-Regulations-November17.pdf As a recipient of a student services and amenities fee, the ANU utilizes ANUSA under its formal process of student consultation as required by the Student Services, Amenities, Representation and Advocacy Guidelines (Representation Guidelines).https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2013C00519  History  = Key events = \\"Wadgate\\" The 1996 ANUSA elections saw the losing \\"Rage\\" ticket embroiled in scandal. 146 votes for the \\"Rage\\" presidential candidate Daniel Jenkins were excluded by the Returning Officer after allegations of ballot stuffing. The fraud was discovered when a student sitting in a cafe saw a voter attempt to stuff a wad of ballots into the ballot box. When the Returning Officer opened the ballot box, five wads of ballots were found, all of which gave their first preference to Jenkins. The scandal was dubbed \\"Wadgate\\" by the student newspaper Woroni and was subsequently reported on the front page of the Canberra Times (05/02/97) and elsewhere. It was also raised at least three times in the Australian Senate by Sen. Eric Abetz (Senate Hansard: 30/10/96, pp.4747-4750; 05/02/97, pp.125-127; and 23/06/97, pp.4929-31). The winning presidential candidate, Matt Tinning from the \\"Counter Attack\\" ticket, secured enough votes to win even if fraudulent votes had not been excluded. = Facilities and Services = ANUSA moved into premises in the Concessions Building in Union Court in 1999, following a major refurbishment. The Brian Kenyon Student Space was opened in 2011, named after Brian Kenyon, who drove ANU's late night bus for 26 years until 2014. As part of the Union Court redevelopment, the Concessions Building was demolished in 2017. ANUSA and the Brian Kenyon Student Space are now located in the Di Riddell Student Centre. = Recent History =  Independence of Woroni  In 2011, ANUSA was incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act 1991 (ACT). The ANU Student Newspaper, Woroni, was previously published by ANUSA, however, the successful 2009 Stand Up! ticket ran on a platform to deliver an independent student newspaper, similar to student publications at North American universities. As a result, ANU Student Media was formed in 2010 as an independent association, and became incorporated in 2012.  Student Services and Amenities Fee Introduction  2012 saw the introduction of the Student Services and Amenities Fee by the Gillard Government, leading to a doubling of the ANUSA budget. This was a catalyst for a new phase of growth for the Association, most apparent in the significant increase in staffing that has occurred.  Campaigns  Key campaigns in recent years have included 'Save the School of Music' in 2012, an attempt to prevent structural changes to ANU School of Music proposed by the University. The campaign attracted national media attention, and was featured on the ABC's 7:30 Report. A petition was signed by over 24,000 people. In 2014, an anti-fee deregulation campaign was spearheaded by Education Officer Laura Wey, also achieving national media coverage. One of the protest marches was comically featured on Channel 9's The Footy Show. In 2017, the 'Month of Strength and Solidarity' campaign was conducted in order to advocate for the changes regarding sexual assault and harassment on campus. = List of Presidents of The Association = The following students served as President of the ANU Students' Associationhttps://anusa.com.au/about/pastpresidents/ * 1962 Don Brewster * 1963 Chris Higgins * 1964 Tony Hartnell * 1965 John Yocklunn, Peter Paterson * 1966 Keith Baker - SRC/ John Yocklunn - ANUSA * 1967 Alan Brooks * 1968 Alan Brooks * 1969 Bob Erwin * 1970 Mark Cunliffe * 1971 Michael Wright * 1972 Richard Refshauge * 1973 * 1974 Michael Dunn * 1975 Julius Roe * 1976 Liz O'Brien * 1977 Jon Nicholson * 1978 Peter Cardwell * 1979 Stephen Bartos * 1980 Louise Tarrant * 1981 Jeffrey Dalton * 1982 Gary Humphries * 1983 Bill Redpath * 1984 Peter Taylor * 1985 Lesley Ward * 1986 Neil McFarlane * 1987 * 1988 Andrew Major * 1989 * 1990 Jon Coroneos * 1991 Elizabeth O'Leary * 1992 Amanda Chadwick * 1993 Kath Cummins * 1994 Caitlin Wyndham * 1995 Hamish McPherson, Craig Cook, Pip Bolding * 1996 Cam Filthson * 1997 Matt Tinning * 1998 Harry Greenwell * 1999 Helen Stitt * 2000 Russell Egan * 2001 Maciej Wasilewicz * 2002 Joanne Yin * 2003 Steve Michelson * 2004 Max Jeganathan * 2005 Aparna Rao * 2006 Laura Crespo * 2007 Claudia Newman- Martin * 2008 Jamila Rizvi * 2009 Sham Sara * 2010 Tully Fletcher * 2011 Leah Ginnivan * 2012 Fleur Hawes, resigned, Dallas Proctor * 2013 Aleks Sladojevic * 2014 Cameron Wilson * 2015 Ben Gill * 2016 Ben Gill * 2017 James Connolly * 2018 Eleanor Kay * 2019 Eden Lim * 2020 Lachlan Day  Structure  = Membership = ANUSA is an association of ANU's more than 10,000 undergraduate students.

Whilst ANUSA is affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS), it did not pay accreditation fees in 2016 due to concerns about the efficacy of NUS and issues relating to student wellbeing at the NUS National Conference. This resulted in its voting rights being suspended at the NUS National Conference that year. In 2017, the body reaccredited to the NUS,http://honisoit.com/2017/03/anu-re-accredits-to-national-union-of- students/ however failed to accredit in 2018 again after the NUS did not meet a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) passed by the ANUSA SRC.

Rocker (born 1943)\\"Profile os a Short Seller\\", The New York Times, April 2006Overstock.com May Seek $1 Billion From Rocker Partners - May 12, 2006 - The New York Sun founded the hedge fund Rocker Partners, LP. Rocker holds a magna cum laude bachelors from Harvard College and a master of business administration from Harvard Business School. Rocker and his wife, Marian, reside in Florida and New Jersey. They have two sons, Daniel and Joshua. Daniel was formerly the head trader at the hedge fund Zimmer Partners. He then earned a master's degree and is now a psychotherapist. Joshua is the Associate Chief of Pediatric Emergency Medicine at Northwell Health. Early life and career Rocker's grandparents were Austrian and Russian immigrants. His father was an accountant in West Orange, NJ, where Rocker was raised and married his high school sweetheart, Marian. After graduating from Harvard College, Rocker served for two years as an officer in the US Navy. He returned to Harvard Business School for his MBA. In 1969, Rocker joined Mitchell Hutchins, where he was a research analyst and investment banker. In 1972, he hired on at Steinhardt, Fine, Berkowitz & Co., a pioneering hedge fund, and was a general partner there from 1973 to 1981. Rocker joined Century Capital, a registered investment adviser, as a partner in 1981. While there, he was a portfolio manager for institutional clients. After Century Capital was acquired in 1985, he formed Rocker Partners with $25 million. Originally based in New York City, the firm expanded over the years adding offices in Larkspur, California and Millburn New Jersey. The firm also managed Compass Holdings and Helmsman Holdings in the BVI which pursued similar strategies for foreign clients. Rocker Partners became incorporated as Copper River Management, LLC. Rocker's former co-manager at the firm, Marc Cohodes, fully assumed managerial duties after Rocker's retirement in early 2007. Rocker is a strong believer in the value of short selling both as an investment strategy on its own but also, more importantly, to provide investors with alternative points of view in an industry famous for its overtly bullish bias. Rocker was known to openly share his views on the market itself as well as on individual stocks. In 2003, he testified on the industry before the House Subcommittee on capital markets. He also wrote numerous articles for Barrons and other publications and was a frequent guest on CNBC.New York Magazine, James Cramer, June 2002 Although short biased firms found it harder to raise money and confronted the bullish bias in the markets, the firm‚Äôs assets grew irregularly, peaking at over $1.2 billion. While the firm suffered loss years, especially during periods of market ebullience, it was able to offset them with substantial gains at other times. This not only provided investors with the hedge they wanted, but also provided excellent returns. In the 21 years that Rocker led the firm, it produced average annual gains of nearly 12%, essentially matching the performance of the market itself, despite the firm‚Äôs net short position. Philanthropy and personal life In retirement Rocker and his wife are actively involved in numerous charities, with a particular focus on Jewish issues, providing opportunities for the less fortunate, and advancing the arts and education. He currently serves on the investment committees of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami. He has been a guest lecturer at the law and business schools at Harvard, Rutgers Law School, Florida International University and the Chartered Financial Analysts Institute. Rocker loves spending time with his family and their six grandchildren. He is an avid sailor and enjoys golf and travel.
