During her career she has sold over 6 million records.  Life and career Born in Piacenza, the daughter of a drummer, Fiordaliso approached music at young age studying voice and piano. In 1981 she won the Castrocaro Music Festival with the song \\"Scappo via\\", and the following year she debuted at the Sanremo Music Festival with the reggae-rock ballad \\"Una sporca poesia\\". Her major successes, remarkably the songs \\"Oramai\\" and \\"Non voglio mica la luna\\" (written by Zucchero Fornaciari), are linked to the Sanremo Festival, in which she participated nine times between 1982 and 2002; outside the Festival, her main hit was the song \\"Cosa ti farei\\", one of the most successful songs of the Summer 1990 in Italy. In the 90s Fiordaliso gradually moved away from the musical scene without ever abandoning it, and focused on the activities of stage actress and television presenter.

The fair takes place annually in March. It is led by EngineeringUK in partnership with over 200 organisations across government, industry, education and the wider science and engineering community. The Big Bang programme exists to bring science and engineering to life for young people. The Big Bang celebrates and raises the profile of young people’s achievements in science and engineering and encourages more young people to take part in science, technology, engineering and maths initiatives with support from their parents and teachers. Big Bang Near Me events take place across the UK to enable young people to discover close to home the exciting and rewarding science and engineering careers that their science and maths subjects can lead to. In 2012, the Big Bang Fair was hosted in the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. An all-girls team of pupils from a state school in the Highlands- Alness Academy were awarded the prestigious title of UK Young Engineers of the Year for their work on health and safety prototypes to be used in Haiti, which had recently suffered major earthquake damage alongside an outbreak of cholera. The six girls were Josie Tolliday, Emma Roddick, Cassie Armstrong, Meg Beattie, Holly Henderson and Kayleigh MacDonald. The all-girl team have continued to excel in their extra- curricular activities. Cassie Armstrong is now an elected Member of Scottish Youth Parliament; Emma Roddick went on to become Donald Dewar Debater of the Year; Kayleigh MacDonald has been successful in dance competition Rock Challenge.  Criticism  The Big Bang Fair has been criticised by NGOs such as the Campaign Against the Arms Trade and Friends of the Earth due to the heavy involvement of arms manufacturers and fossil fuel companies at the event. The event has been described as being a PR stunt rather than being a genuine attempt to educate children and get them involved in STEM in future. Furthermore it has also been criticised for presenting a \\"distorted view of the value of science\\" in reference to the involvement of arms manufacturers and oil companies.

As of 2018, The Signal has a weekly circulation of about 5,000 issues distributed to all Georgia State campuses, including Alpharetta, Atlanta, Decatur, Dunwoody, Newton and a handful of locations in the surrounding area. The paper publishes on Tuesdays during Spring and Fall semesters (in addition to a summer magazine for incoming students). It primarily covers news, events and issues specific to the Georgia State community and covers stories relating to the city of Atlanta with interest to its readers. History Georgia State's student newspaper evolved with each incarnation of the school. The school's first student newspaper, The Technite, was named in homage to the Georgia Institute of Technology's own student paper, The Technique, when the school was founded as the Georgia School of Technology's Evening School of Commerce. In 1933, when the university became the Atlanta Extension Center of the University System of Georgia, the day division and night division of the school each produced their own separate newspaper (named The Junior Collegiate and the Evening Signal, respectively). The publications would twice coordinate with one another, initially as the Collegiate-Signal on April 21, 1941, and again as the University Signal on September 22, 1941. When the two publications merged permanently in 1943, the formal name of the publication became The Signal. Since that time, a number of mastheads have been used, including The University Signal, The Georgia State Signal, the Georgia State College Signal, and the Georgia State University Signal. During his time at Georgia State, D.W. Pine, Design Director of Time magazine was editor-in-chief of The Signal. Present-day publication The March 13, 2012 front page of The Signal The print edition of The Signal is published every Tuesday during the Fall and Spring semesters, with the exceptions of Finals Week, Spring break and Thanksgiving break. It also prints a special summer magazine for incoming freshman and transfer students, known as The Urbanite (named after the arts & entertainment magazine once published by The Signal in the 1990s and 2000s). The website is updated daily throughout the year. The newspaper is operated by a staff of approximately 100 paid and unpaid students, subdivided into editorial, production, marketing and advertising departments. Although Georgia State offers degrees in journalism, The Signal allows students from any major within the university to contribute. It is funded primarily by print and digital advertising, while its printing costs are paid for by student fees. It runs its website independent from the school and the current URL (georgiastatesignal.com) was launched in 2012 after over a decade of the paper publishing through the College Publisher system (at gsusignal.com). Sections The print edition of The Signal is generally between 16 and 20 pages long and organized into four sections: *Arts and Living includes human interest stories, reviews of music, movies, performance arts, and video games, cartoons, a crossword puzzle, sudoku puzzles, and campus events. *News includes news, investigative stories and Georgia State- specific crime reports. *Opinions includes editorials, an editorial cartoon, op-eds, and letters to the editor, as well as a regular Student Vox feature. *Sports includes features, team profiles, in-depth analysis and summaries of recent Georgia State sports games. Awards The Signal has won numerous awards, including; *The 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2017 General Excellence awards in \\"Division 4A\\" from the Georgia College Press Association *The \\"Best College Newspaper\\" award in the Southeast Journalism Conference's 2013, 2016, and 2017 \\"Best of the South\\" contests *Best in Show in its division at the National College Media Convention on November 4, 2012 Notable Alumni * John C.

It was first published by in hardcover by DAW Books in 1989.http://www.mzbworks.com/ Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Trust The book takes place during the era of Darkover's history known as the Hundred Kingdoms. This is the last book in the Darkover series written entirely by Bradley without the assistance of a co-author. Plot summary For many years, the houses of Hammerfell and Storn have been locked in perpetual conflict. Having lost his son and heir in a battle with the men of Storn, Rascard, Duke of Hammerfell, marries the much younger Erminie Leynier. The couple's union produces two sons, Alastair, the heir to Hammerfell, and his twin, Conn. When the children are about 18 months old, Storn attacks with clingfire. Erminie escapes with Alastair and her dog Jewel, while a servant, Markos, who is carrying Conn, is separated from her in the confusion. Eighteen years later, finds Erminie as Second Technician at Thendara. Her colleague at Thendara, Valentine Hastur, asks for Erminie’s hand in marriage, but she puts him off. At a social event, Alastair meets his cousin, Floria Elhalyn, whom he has not seen since he was a child. He is introduced to King Hastur, who indicates that he will support Alastair’s claim to Hammerfell, if Alastair will not pledge allegiance to Aldaran. In the remote mountains, Markos has raised Conn. He is living a Robin Hood-like existence, supporting the causes of the common folk who have been abused by Lord Storn. He presents himself to Valentine Hastur, who initially mistakes him for Alastair. Hastur arranges to reunite the family. Like Hastur, Conn finds little of worth about his brother. Alastair insists on riding to the mountains and leading a small army against Storn. A fire breaks out on the Storn lands, and somewhat against his will, Alastair joins the fire brigade. He realizes that he is attracted to Lenisa of Storn, the granddaughter of Lord Storn, despite being more or less engaged to Floria Elhalyn. While fighting the fire, Alastair is injured. Conn perceives this through the laran connection to his brother. A party sets out for the mountains. Alastair is taken to Storn Castle to recover from his burns. Lord Storn expresses a desire to see ended the feud between Storn and Hammerfell. Lord Storn tells Alastair that the land is played out, only good for pasturing sheep, but discovers that his soldiers have been burning out his tenants, rather than gently persuading them to leave. He explains to Conn what he has previously explained to Alastair, and suggests that the time for feuding is over. It's determined that Alastair will marry Lenisa of Storn, and Conn will marry Floria Elhayln. Erminie agrees to marry Valentine Hastur.

Early life Valerie Winifred Grosvenor Godwin was born in Lower Soudley in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England. Her parents, Donald Godwin and his wife Margaret (née Jones), owned several cottages, but the village had no electricity or indoor sanitation until she was in her late teens. An illegitimate connection, dating from the early nineteenth century, could be traced, through her great- great grandfather Richard Grosvenor, with the Grosvenor family, Marquesses and later Dukes of Westminster — on both sides as her parents were second cousins. She studied at East Dean Grammar School, leaving at the age of 16 to train as a librarian in Gloucester. Reporter She began writing freelance reports for the Forest of Dean Mercury before being taken on as a reporter, and moved in 1958 to the Dartford Chronicle in Kent. She then worked for two Fleet Street women's magazines, Housewife (sub-editor) and Flair (Chief sub-editor). After marrying Michael Myer in 1959, she attended a course at the City Literary Institute. Cambridge education On the advice of her lecturer, she entered for and won a Mature State Scholarship with an extended essay on one of Jane Austen's juvenilia, \\"Catherine, or the Bower\\", and its relationship to her mature work, and went up to Newnham College, Cambridge in 1963 to read English, graduating at the age of 31 with a first class degree. During her time at Cambridge, she wrote theatre criticism for The Guardian. Sue Limb, Valerie Grosvenor Myer: Fervent communicator and university teacher in dangerous places, The Guardian, 15 August 2007. Retrieved 10 May 2013 Biography at GoodReads.com. Retrieved 10 May 2013 She was taught in her third year by the distinguished but opinionated Q D Leavis, to whom, as the supervisor held forth on the virtues of the 'organic community' during the course of a discussion of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, Valerie mentioned that she knew from experience that it could have its disadvantages, having herself had a rural upbringing with no electricity or modern sanitation. \\"Nonsense, dear,\\" snapped know-it-all Mrs Leavis, \\"you're much too young!\\" Later career Her post-graduate career was in editing, university teaching, and writing. Having studied for a Postgraduate Certificate in Education at Hughes Hall, Cambridge, she taught briefly at Secondary School level; but finding this uncongenial, she appropriately combined her two areas of experience in educational journalism: Deputy Arts Editor of The Times Educational Supplement before moving to The Teacher (weekly newspaper of the National Union of Teachers) as Literary and Features Editor. Obituary, The Stage, 4 September 2007. Retrieved 10 May 2013 She remained living in Cambridge, commuting by train to these London jobs, whilst also supervising undergraduates, having been included on the English Faculty list of Approved Supervisors, for Cambridge colleges Queens', Homerton and Robinson, and was elected to an Associateship at Lucy Cavendish College. Notable among her supervisees were Richard Maher at Queens', Jan Ravens at Homerton, Andy White and Morwenna Banks at Robinson. On the invitation of Professor Wu Ningkun, who was a visiting fellow at Cambridge, she taught at the Beijing Language Institute, later the Beijing Language and Culture University, and in 1989 worked there close to the Tiananmen Square protests, visiting her students in the square just the day before the demonstration was brought violently to an end by the People's Liberation Army, after which she had to flee at risk of gunfire before her year's contract was complete: she spent a night at the Beijing Toronto Hotel on her way to the airport, and there were actually bullet-holes in its walls next morning. She also taught at Fourah Bay College, (University of Freetown), Sierra Leone, where she was caught up in the civil war in 1991. \\"These episodes suggested that Valerie's life was becoming more adventurous and dangerous as she neared retirement age,\\" wrote Sue Limb in her obituary in The Guardian. Academic work and novels As well as the Cambridge University supervisions and the university teaching in Beijing and Freetown noted above, she lectured at various times in the USA (School of the Art Institute of Chicago), Canada (University of New Brunswick at St John), France (University of Bourges), and Sweden (Lund University), and for the Cambridge Folklore Group, the Cambridge Jane Austen Society, the University of the Third Age, and several Cambridge-based international Summer Schools. Her writings included a study of Margaret Drabble, Puritanism and Permissiveness in 1974, biographies of Jane Austen, Harriette Wilson and Mary Kingsley, critical studies of Charlotte Brontë, Samuel Richardson and Laurence Sterne. Poems appeared in Peepshow, New Poetry (ed Norman Hidden), The Interpreter's House (ed Merryn Williams), Chelmer Festival Anthology, &c.; She also wrote novels: Culture Shock (Duckworth 1988), and The Butterfly House (Fern House {Rodney Dale} 1998) which drew on her experience in China. She collaborated with Beijing colleague Professor Li Yanshu in a standard comprehension textbook for Chinese students of English. Her study of Ten Great English Novelists was published simultaneously by Vision Press London & St Martin's Press New York (1990). She contributed short stories to Arts Council UK anthologies edited by Margaret Drabble and Angus Wilson, and literary articles to The Oxford Companion to English Literature, The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (ed Ian Ousby), The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature. She was for many years Cambridge theatre critic for The Stage. Her final work was to co-edit with Steven R Serafin the Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature (2003), an ambitious work published in New York aimed at American students. She was also a keen and accomplished black-&-white photographer, having a darkroom built into her Cambridgeshire home, holding several exhibitions in Cambridge, and contributing publicity and record-sleeve photographs to her friends, the folksingers Nic Jones, Peter Bellamy, and Anthea Bellamy-Birch. Illness and death After she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the 1990s, she told her husband Michael that she would commit suicide when she judged the degeneration caused by the illness to have become intolerable, but before she lost the necessary physical ability, and did so in 2007.

A Republican, she represents Forest Lake, Stillwater, and the surrounding St. Croix Valley. Housley ran unsuccessfully as the Republican nominee in Minnesota's 2018 special election for the United States Senate. Early life, education, and career Housley was born and raised in South St. Paul, Minnesota. She graduated from South St. Paul High School in 1982 and briefly attended Augsburg College before moving to Buffalo, New York after her high school sweetheart, Phil Housley, was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres. She enrolled at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where she graduated in 1987 with a B.A. in communication studies. After earning her degree, Housley worked as a news producer for WGRZ and WKBW in Buffalo until 1991. Housley is the author of Chicks Laying Nest Eggs: How 10 Skirts Beat the Pants Off Wall Street...And How You Can Too!, a book aimed at helping women invest in the stock market. The book was published by Random House in 2001. Minnesota Senate Housley has represented Forest Lake, Stillwater, and communities along the St. Croix Valley in the Minnesota Senate since 2013. As a state senator, Housley is best known for her work on issues related to aging and long-term care and veterans. Housley was instrumental in the creation of a first-ever Minnesota Senate committee on aging, which she currently chairs. In 2019, Housley was the author of \\"landmark\\" legislation that provided enhanced protections for elderly and vulnerable adults in senior care facilities and licensed assisted living facilities in Minnesota for the first time. Housley was selected by her colleagues to serve as an assistant majority leader for the 2019 and 2020 legislative sessions. Housley in 2018  Political campaigns  In 2010, her first run for public office, Housley was narrowly defeated by DFL incumbent Katie Sieben for election to the Minnesota Senate. After redistricting placed Housley's residence in a new district, she was elected to that seat in 2012, defeating her opponent by one percent. She was re-elected in 2016, defeating her opponent by more than 20 percent. In 2014, Housley was selected by Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Honour, a businessman from Orono, to be his candidate for lieutenant governor of Minnesota. The pair was defeated in the 2014 Republican primary. In December 2017, Housley announced she intended to seek the Republican nomination in the 2018 special election for United States Senate. The seat was vacated by Al Franken, who resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Tina Smith, then the lieutenant governor, was appointed by Governor Mark Dayton to fill Franken's vacancy, and announced she intended to seek election to the seat. Housley won the Republican primary and was defeated by Smith, the Democratic incumbent, in the general election. In March 2019, Housley registered a political action committee to assist conservative candidates running for office in Minnesota, fueling speculation that she would run for the same U.S. Senate seat again in 2020. She ultimately decided against it, instead announcing she will seek a third term in the Minnesota Senate. Personal life After living in Buffalo, Winnipeg, St. Louis, Calgary, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Toronto, and Phoenix during Phil's National Hockey League career, the Housleys moved back to Minnesota in 2003. Karin and Phil have four children, each graduates of Stillwater Area High School, and two grandchildren. They reside in St. Marys Point. Housley owns a real estate business in Stillwater.

It consists of approximately 300 women with qualified medical training in voluntary military service in support of the medical service in the Swiss Armed Forces, founded by Henry Dunant Red Cross traditions. The members of the RKD (AdRKD) are divided into units, bodies of troops and staffs of the Swiss Armed Forces. They are trained by the army, equipped, used and remunerated. With few exceptions, they have the same rights and duties as the male members of the Army Medical Service. In particular, they enjoy the protection of the Geneva Conventions. AdRKD provide refresher courses with the troops, they are under the Coordinated Medical (KSD), but may also occur in extraordinary circumstances (severe epidemics or major disaster). They wear the uniform and insignia of the Army and related income replacement. The military grade are accompanied by the words \\"RKD\\", for example \\"Wm RKD\\" for sergeant. The management of the service holds since February 2006 Colonel RKD Brigitte Rindlisbacher. Qualification The Red Cross service accepts Swiss citizens who are between 18 and 38 years old. This requires a professional training in healthcare or in the areas of international law, education or adult education (for teaching of International humanitarian law and Red Cross principles). History The mass internment of foreign military personnel in Switzerland, showed in the German-French war, that the civilian Swiss Red Cross (SRC) and the Swiss Army are mutually dependent. Therefore, were private nursing training in 1903, which were under the patronage of the SRC, subsidized founds from the federal treasury. In return, the SRC had to support the army medical service if needed at a mobilization of two thirds of its medical personnel. Initially, only nurses were assigned to the Red Cross service. Later, women of pharmacy, medicine and alternative medicine are encouraged to join the Red Cross service. From the 2nd World War, Girl Scouts, office professional women, teachers, lawyers, etc. have been used in military hospitals, where they performed support services for the benefit of Hospital Administration.

The Jordaanlied (\\"Jordaan song\\") is a type of levenslied, the Dutch genre of nostalgic sentimental popular music; the Jordaanlied hails from and sings the praises of the Amsterdam neighborhood the Jordaan which, until the 1960s, was an impoverished working-class area. The genre first came to the fore in the late 19th century and reached extraordinary popularity in the 1950s, before becoming old-fashioned quickly when rock and roll came along. It continues to be sung in the now-yuppified Jordaan, as a local favorite and a tourist attraction in a profoundly changed neighborhood; already a nostalgic genre when it was first made popular, the situations it describes and the emotions it evokes are no longer directly accessible even by the older generations, a transformation due in part to the Jordaanlied itself. History Until World War II The first Jordaanlied, according to cabaret artist and historian Jacques Klöters, dates from 1897, and is a song called \\"Pietje Puck\\". The genre helped initiate and later perpetuate a myth of the Jordaan, Klöters argued, a myth of a world full of poor, hard-working, and fun-loving people who adhere to traditional values. A second wave of popularity came during and after World War I, and was prompted by the work of Dutch writer Israël Querido, who had written a four- volume novel De Jordaan. A play inspired by Querido's characterization of Jordaners, as \\"hard workers, hard drinkers, working under terrible conditions and having their emotions only just below the surface\\", was a big hit: Herman Boubers' Mooie Neel (1916) was the story of a factory girl who is seduced by her boss and left with the consequences. Boubers wrote a second play, this time with songs written in collaboration with Louis Davids, one of the greatest artists in cabaret in the Netherlands, whom Boubers had met by chance in a cafe on the Rembrandtplein, one of the city's main entertainment areas. Davids composed a number of Jordaan-themed songs (though he was a Rotterdammer) with his then-girlfriend, the English singer and actress Margie Morris, for the enormously popular Bleeke Bet (1917) which had the Jordaan as background and topic. One of the play's songs, \\"O oude mooie toren\\", later specified as \\"O mooie Westertoren\\", became the area's first \\"anthem\\". Boubers followed the overwhelming success of Bleeke Bet with more of the same, including songs by Davids and Morris; Oranje Hein (1919) and De Jantjes (1920) were just as successful and made him a rich man (he bought himself a motorboat called De Jantjes). In the 1930s, with the advent of cinema, his plays were made into films; singer Johan Heester and actress Fien de la Mar were the most popular stars of the time, and practically every successful Dutch movie of the era was set in Amsterdam, a theme continued until the outbreak of World War II. According to Henk van Gelder, popular Dutch sentiment seemed to identify completely with Amsterdam and especially de Jordaan. The 1950s and after Statue of Johnny Jordaan with Johnny Meijer in the background on the Johnny Jordaanplein, Amsterdam. Photo by Nils Emmink, Amsterdam. The Jordaanlied was again popular after World War II and peaked in the 1950s, finally beginning to be accepted in mainstream national culture; notable singers in the genre of that era were Johnny Jordaan (the \\"uncrowned king of the Jordaanlied\\"), Willy Alberti, Tante Leen, Zwarte Riek, and Manke Nelis. That surge in the 1950s began with a cabaret artist and two songwriters. The cabaret artist was Wim Sonneveld, who early in the 1950s developed a character called Willem Parel for his Saturday evening radio show; Parel was a barrel organ player from the Jordaan, who made Sonneveld achieve stardom. Sonneveld came from Utrecht and his Amsterdam dialect was clearly imitative, but he did pave the way for a national audience to accept the Jordaan dialect and themes again. At the same time, two songwriters from Amsterdam, Henk Voogt (\\"Henvo\\") and Louis Noiret (real name Louis Schwarz), developed the actual Jordaanlied; two of their songs, \\"Bij ons in de Jordaan\\" and \\"De parel van de Jordaan\\", were performed by Henk Berlips at a Jordaan festival in September 1954 to great acclaim. At the time, no record company showed any interest for a kind of music because they thought it lacked national appeal, but Henvo and Louis Noret managed to get Ger Oord, the manager of the record company Bovema, to sponsor a talent show and offer the winner a contract. The finals of that talent show were held on 2 March 1955 in Hotel Krasnapolsky, and were won by a singing bartender, Jan van Musscher, also known as Johnny Jordaan. Helena Jansen-Polder, better known as Tante Leen, finished second. Johnny Jordaan recorded \\"Bij ons in de Jordaan\\" and \\"De parel van de Jordaan\\" two days later, and the single was an instant success. The real breakthrough, though, was \\"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\\", a Pi Vèriss composition that Johnny Jordaan recorded the same year. In all, Bovema sold 360,000 records in 1955. Jordaan and Tante Leen became stars, and the entire country was ready to embrace the Jordaanlied. Still considered a low-brow genre, it was boycotted by a number of radio stations in the pillarized Dutch society of the period after World War II, including the socialist VARA; only the AVRO played this music in the 1950s. The artists from the 1950s, though, relied for their music and repertoire on the style of the period between the wars without making any significant changes, even while rock and roll and blues were on the way to take over popular culture. In addition, the Jordaanlied helped make the area so popular that since the 1960s it has gentrified completely; many of the lower-income classes have moved out of the city altogether, and the Jordaan is now largely inhabited by yuppies and professionals. Changing musical tastes in the 1960s and 1970s ended the widespread popularity of the genre, though it continues to play a part in the Jordaan's culture and is a significant tourist attraction. Themes and style Spire of the Westertoren. Musical background Musically, the Jordaanlied leans on the tradition of the 19th-century cabaret, and especially on the Italian style of opera which was very popular in the area, borrowing \\"chords, rhythms, melodies, and ways of singing\\". Willy Alberti, for instance, began his career singing Italian songs. Another notable influence during the 1950s was the swing repertoire, with lyrics in Dutch. Instrumentation is traditional, and the accordion plays an important role; important accordion players were Harry de Groot and Johnny Meijer, the latter having a statue behind Johnny Jordaan on the Johnny Jordaanplein in Amsterdam. Nostalgia The Jordaanlied usually treats the past nostalgically; this past is a working- class history, the Jordaan having been deeply impoverished since the middle of the 19th century. In the songs, laborers and their families work hard and remain poor, but nonetheless, \\"Jordaners hop singing through life, despite poverty and misery\\". One particular profession that figures in the genre is shelling shrimp, a job done by many women of the area in the 19th and 20th centuries, as in \\"Grote garnalen\\" by Henvo and Louis Noret: > Ik zit aan de stal in het hart der Jordaan > En ik pel voor m'n brood de garnalen > Dat heb m'n familie al jaren gedaan > Dat waren zo hun idealen. > (\\"I sit at my stall in the heart of the Jordaan, shelling shrimp for a > living; my family has done that for years, that was their ideal\\") As Klöters argues, that world was already gone by the time the Jordaanlied reached the height of its popularity and for the 1950s singers was little more than nostalgia for their youth; he sees this sentimentality it as a reaction to the threat posed by the fast-changing world of the post-World War II period, a nostalgia for a \\"safer\\" period. Van Gelder adds that 1955 was the year rock and roll was introduced from the United States to the Netherlands, and the same year a new word for young people, \\"nozem\\", was coined to indicate a new and completely different youth culture. The Westertoren The Westertoren, the spire of the Westerkerk, symbolizes the area and plays an important role in the music--in 1917's Bleeke Bet, in the songs of Johan Heesters from the 1930s, and in many Jordaanliederen of the 1950s. \\"Real\\" Jordaners have to be born within earshot of the tower's carillon. \\"Aan de voet van die ouwe Wester\\" (\\"At the foot of that old Wester\\") is the title of one of Willy Alberti's greatest hits. The Westertoren is referred to as \\"De parel van de Jordaan\\" (\\"The pearl of the Jordaan\\"), also the subject and title of Johnny Jordaan's first big hit—and he himself came to be called \\"Parel van de Jordaan\\". Poet and writer Willem Wilmink remarked that the Westertoren is revered as a stand-in for God.

He successfully defended the Government of Tamil Nadu's Samacheer Kalvi system of Uniform School Education before the Madras High Court as well as the Supreme Court of India. He also successfully defended the landmark legislation of the Tamil Nadu Government to fix uniform fees in all schools in the State. He has appeared and defended the National Highways Authority of India in several matters pertaining to large infrastructural projects. As a Senior Advocate before the Madras High Court, Wilson has appeared in several cases of immense public importance. A few of them are: 1\\\\. The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the move of the State Government to convert the multi-crore Secretariat Building at Omandurar Government Estate into a Multi-Speciality Hospital. 2\\\\. The PIL challenging the decision of the State Government to shift the Anna Centenary Library out of its world class building on political considerations. The Hon'ble Madras High Court has stayed the proposed conversion in 2011. Subsequently in 2015, the Hon'ble Madras High Court quashed the state's move to shift and issued a series of directives such as filling staff vacancies, maintaining the complex and purchase of books and magazines. This is one of the rarest case wherein the Hon'ble First Bench is issuing continuing mandamus from time to time to see that the World class Anna Centenary Library is restored back to its original position and is upgraded with all latest books. 3\\\\. The Constitutional Challenge to the setting up of Special Cells and Special Courts by the State Government to try a class of offences called \\"land grabbing\\". The First Bench of the Madras High Court quashed the Government Orders setting up these Courts and Special Cells. 4\\\\. He fought for the retrenched 13000 Makkal Nala Paniyalargal who were dismissed by the Tamil Nadu state government due to political vendetta, and the division bench of Madras High court directed the State Government to absorb the 13000 retrenched employees in various posts of government on or before 31 October 2014 otherwise they should be paid their last drawn salary till appointment. 5\\\\. He was instrumental in getting direction against the Election Commission to have webcasting of all the booths during the conduct of corporation election in 2011. 6\\\\. He appeared in the case filed by T.K.S.Elangovan, Member of Parliament challenging the appointment of eleven public service commission members wherein the Madras High Court in a path breaking judgment quashed their appointments. 7\\\\. He was successful in transferring the investigation relating to alleged suicide of R.Vishnupriya the then DSP of Tiruchengode from the CBCID to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The subsequent appeal by the State government to Supreme Court was dismissed after hearing his arguments. 8\\\\. He prevented the closure of schools when the Tamil Nadu state government decided to do so after the conviction and imprisonment of Ms.J.Jayalalitha the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in disproportionate asset case. 9\\\\. He appeared in a case where the High Court directed the Mayor of Vellore Municipal Corporation to tender apology when a resolution was passed condemning special judge Kunha for passing verdict against Ms.J.Jayalaitha in disproportionate asset case. 10\\\\. The effort to stop Trichy-Karaikudi(NH 210) NHAI Road Project was challenged before the Madras High Court by NHAI and he was successful in getting the interim injunction restraining the State Government from interfering with laying of roads by NHAI. The High Court subsequently held that the project being of public importance and state action to stop the Road Project is against public interest besides being irrational, thereby allowing NHAI to complete the project. 11\\\\. He was successful in quashing the Election Commission’s notification relating to holding of local body elections in the state which was slated to be conducted in 2016 before the Madras High Court. He was successful in arguing the appeal preferred by the state Election Commission and the Hon’ble First Bench of Madras High Court gave direction to conduct fresh election before 17 November 2017. 12\\\\. He along with Advocate K.Balu sought to stall any move by the Tamil Nadu State Government to circumvent the Supreme Court order upholding a ban on liquor vends within 500m of National and State Highways. The High Court restrained the State Government from opening any TASMAC liquor shops for the subsequent three months. 13\\\\. Gutka is classified as chewable tobacco causes cancer, heart attack and kidney failure when consumed. About 15% of population in Tamilnadu are addicted to this chewable tobacco and younger generation heath and financial status gets spoiled due to this addiction. The said chewable tobacco was sold in soil of Tamilnadu freely despite orders of Supreme Court and Ban issued by Government of Tamilnadu due to the high collusion and nexus between Gutka Mafia manufacturer's with State Minister,High Police officials, State and Central Government officials. Mr Wilson was successful in appearing and arguing before Hon'ble First Bench consisting of Hon'ble Chief Justice Ms Indira Banerjee and Hon'ble Mr Justice Abdul Quddhose and getting the investigation transferred to CBI from State Police. In a remarkable and path breaking Judgement the Madras High Court held the right to health is a constitutional right and it is duty of state to protect its citizens from the evils of chewable tobacco which spoils the younger generations. 14\\\\. When Dr Kalaignar the 5 time Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and President of DMK party passed away on 7.8.2018 and when request from family members and DMK Party to bury the mortals of Late leader at Arignar Anna Samathi was refused by the Tamilnadu Government, he moved a Writ petition on same day late evening at the Judges residence seeking for a decent burial at Anna Samathi. The matter was heard by the Hon'ble first Bench which commenced at late night on 7.8.2018 and ended around 2.30 Am on 8.8.2018 and again resumed at 8 Am and concluded at 12 noon on 8.8.2018. Mr Wilson was successful in getting the land allotted at Marina next to Anna Samathi. He has also appeared in several high profile cases that were widely covered by the media such as the Vishwaroopam case, and the PIL against conferring of the Bharat Ratna to Sachin Tendulkar References Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Indian lawyers ","title":"P.

History The name Coventry Cross dates back to a public house by that name. Local historians have suggested that the name may have originated with a pre-Reformation cross belonging to a local convent, and that the name was corrupted over time to \\"Coventry Cross\\". 178 flats were built by the London County Council, on the east side of Brunswick Road, opening in 1935. As well as the main block called Coventry Cross, there were two smaller blocks, Fuller and Tennant Houses. They were not built with individual bathrooms, but each three flats shared one, along with an area for washing clothes. The line of Brunswick Road became a major road, the Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach (BTNA), part of the A102 and now the A12. In the early 1950s, the LCC built seven blocks of flats to the west of the BTNA, and named the estate Coventry Cross West. Ownership of the estate passed in time to the Greater London Council and then to Tower Hamlets. The original Coventry Cross and adjacent blocks were demolished in the 1990s. The remaining blocks west of the A12 kept the name Coventry Cross Estate. In the 2000s, Tower Hamlets consulted the tenants of the estate over a possible transfer to a housing association, and they voted in December 2007 to join Poplar HARCA, a locally based social landlord. Tenants expressed a 65% majority in favour, although most leaseholders opposed the move. The transfer was not completed until 2009 due to negotiations over the amount of government grant to support the required refurbishment. Modern estate signage in 2012 The works programme not only brought the houses up to the Decent Homes Standard, but achieved marked improvements in energy efficiency as well as security, landscaping and visual enhancements. Residents celebrated completion of the regeneration in October 2012.

His distinctive balding scalp, rotund body, thick Brooklyn accent and impassioned sales pitches made him a recognized television presence in the United States, primarily in the New York Metropolitan Area. Rosenberg was the co-owner of JGE (Jamaica Gas & Electric) Appliances, a 40-store appliance chain, along with his brother Charlie. He began with one store in Bayside, Queens, and created what he once called a \\"$100 million empire.\\" One of the stores was owned by them, and the other 30 were licensed. Beginning in 1971, Rosenberg appeared in a series of advertisements for JGE that started with the off-screen line \\"What's the story, Jerry?\\" and ended with another off-screen line \\"So that's the story, Jerry,\\" in which he would reply in his trademark accent \\"That's the story!\\" Rosenberg ran the business with his brother Charles. In 1974, The New York Times said they \\"may well be the first appliance merchants who have made the media the message.\\" He presented himself as a friend of the working man, union members, civil service employees, and their families, who received discounts on all sales. JGE's sales increased from $2 million in 1971 to an estimated $50 million in 1974. By the mid 1970s, he began advertising for other businesses such as jewelry stores, furniture retailers, and discothèques, all in the same style as those of his appliance chain, with the same union-member discounts. In December 1974, New York City sued Rosenberg, his brother Charles and JGE Enterprises in New York State Supreme Court. The suit sought $250,000 in restitution for victimized customers, claiming deceptive advertising. Elinor C. Guggenheimer, the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, said that JGE lured customers into leaving large deposits for furniture and appliances that would arrive months later, damaged. The city had received 300 consumer complaints. Rosenberg denied the charges. Rosenberg countersued the city for libel, abuse of process and conspiracy. His company was defunct by 1977, when The New York Times reported that he had placed a \\"positions wanted\\" advertisement in The Wall Street Journal, stating that he was \\"ready for a challenge,\\" and seeking a position in sales, merchandising, advertising or public relations.

He was one of the earliest exponents of the new art of linocut printmaking in Britain during the early 1930s. He was one of a small group of progressive and highly regarded printmakers who exhibited at the Redfern and Ward Galleries in central London. Whilst working in relative isolation in Yorkshire, most of his contemporaries were linked in some way to the Grosvenor School of Modern Art, located in Pimlico, London. Early life and career Beaumont was born and raised in Broomhall, Sheffield. Whilst studying evening classes at The Sheffield Technical School of Art he was employed by The Sheffield Daily Telegraph newspaper to produce black and white advertisements. He was awarded a full-time scholarship, however his artistic career was cut short by the outbreak of World War One, in which he served with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves in India and Ceylon (1915–1918). After the war he re-joined the art department of the Sheffield Telegraph. He married Gertrude Roberts in 1921 and shared a joint passion for Russian politics, film and literature. Printmaker and book publisher He taught himself how to produce etchings after reading E. S. Lumsden's book 'The Art of Etching' (1925).Lumsden, Ernest Stephen. 'The Art of Etching' (Seely, Service and Co. Ltd. London 1925). He travelled extensively throughout mainland Europe and produced his first significant collection of etchings, several of which were shown in London at the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibitions (1929–1933). He designed and built his own printing press which he installed in his home. He was elected a member of several important printmaking societies in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh. His etchings were highly praised by the two preeminent critics of the day, Malcolm Charles Salaman and Campbell Dodgson. His etchings were essentially topographical views, reinterpretations of sketches produced whilst on holiday in Continental Europe.Salaman, Malcolm Charles. 'Fine Prints of the Year: 9th Annual Review of Contemporary Etching & Engravings’. Halton & Co. Ltd., London 1931 (p.2 pl.7); Salaman, Malcolm Charles. ‘Fine Prints of the Year: 10th Annual Review of Contemporary Etching & Engravings’. Halton & Co.

However it is his work as a linocut printmaker where his reputation now rests. Inspired by Claude Flight Flight, Claude. ‘Lino-Cuts: A Handbook of Linoleum-Cut Colour Printing’ John Lane, The Bodley Head, London 1927. he produced most of his distinctive linocuts over a four- year period (1930–1934). His most notable works were exhibited throughout Great Britain and subsequently North America.‘Original Lino-Cuts’, Sheffield Daily Independent 1 June 1933; ‘A Sheffield Artist’, Sheffield Daily Telegraph 15 June 1933; ‘Colour Prints and Paintings: Measure of A Medium’, The Morning Post 3 June 1933; ‘Scottish Art Shown in London: Modernist Approach’, The Bulletin and Scots Pictorial 20 June 1933; ‘Art Exhibitions’ Review of ‘Colour Prints’ exhibition at the Redfern Gallery, London. The Morning Post 12 July 1934; Luther Carey, Elisabeth. ‘Print Shows’, The Brooklyn Museum Quarterly. October 1934 (No.4 p.98). As a result, his prints were acquired by several notable public art collections, including The British Museum, London, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, The National Gallery of Canada and Auckland Art Gallery, New Zealand. He published three books under his own imprint, Eismeer Press; ‘The Art of Linoleum’ (1932) and 'Rhymes & Rhythms for Young People' (1933). Both publications are rare examples produced during the inter-war years which incorporate original linocuts. His next publication ‘To Daffadills’ (1934) incorporated a delicate wood engraving around Robert Herrick’s 17th century ode to the brevity of spring. The success of these publications led to several commissions for book illustrations and began a lifelong association with Sir Francis Meynell, the founder of Nonsuch Press.Meynell, Sir Francis. ‘My Lives’, The Bodley Head Limited, London 1971.

The bill instructs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to create a national Blue Alert communication system under the direction of a national coordinator. The system would spread important information about law enforcement officers hurt or killed in the line of duty in an attempt to make catching the perpetrators easier. Background Existing alert systems in the United States, such as the AMBER Alert or Silver Alert, use a variety of means to notify people of an issue. AMBER Alerts announce missing or kidnapped children, while Silver Alerts announce missing senior citizens, especially those with dementia. AMBER Alerts are distributed via commercial radio stations, Internet radio, satellite radio, television stations, and cable TV by the Emergency Alert System and NOAA Weather RadioMagazine.noaa.gov Publicaffairs.noaa.gov (where they are termed \\"Child Abduction Emergency\\" or \\"Amber Alerts\\"). The alerts are also issued via e-mail, electronic traffic- condition signs, the LED billboards which are located outside of newer Walgreens locations,News.walgreens.com along with the LED/LCD signs of billboard companies such as Clear Channel Outdoor, CBS Outdoor and Lamar,Lamaroutdoor.com or through wireless device SMS text messages. Silver Alerts use a wide array of media outlets – such as commercial radio stations, television stations, and cable television – to broadcast information about missing persons. Silver Alerts also use variable-message signs on roadways to alert motorists to be on the lookout for missing seniors. In cases in which a missing person is believed to be missing on foot, Silver Alerts have used Reverse 911 or other emergency notification systems to notify nearby residents of the neighborhood surrounding the missing person's last known location. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The National Blue Alert Act of 2013 directs the United States Attorney General to establish a national Blue Alert communications network within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to disseminate information when a law enforcement officer is seriously injured or killed in the line of duty. This new National Blue Alert system would coordinate with federal, state, and local Blue Alert plans. The Attorney General is also ordered to assign an existing DOJ officer to act as the national coordinator of the Blue Alert communications network. The bill then explains what the duties of that new national coordinator would be. They include: :(1) providing assistance to states and local governments that are using Blue Alert plans; :(2) establishing voluntary guidelines for states and local governments to use in developing such plans; :(3) developing protocols for efforts to apprehend suspects; :(4) working with states to ensure appropriate regional coordination of various elements of the network; :(5) establishing an advisory group to assist states, local governments, law enforcement agencies, and other entities in initiating, facilitating, and promoting Blue Alert plans; :(6) acting as the nationwide point of contact for the development of the network and the regional coordination of Blue Alerts through the network; and :(7) determining what procedures and practices are in use for notifying law enforcement and the public when a law enforcement officer is killed or seriously injured in the line of duty and which of the procedures and practices are effective and that do not require the expenditure of additional resources to implement Congress places two specific requirements on the guidelines that the national coordinator would create. First, the guidelines must provide that appropriate information relating to a Blue Alert is disseminated to officials of law enforcement, public health, and other agencies. Second, the guidelines must provide mechanisms that ensure that Blue Alerts comply with all applicable federal, state, and local privacy laws and regulations and include standards that specifically provide for the protection of the civil liberties of law enforcement officers and their families. Finally, the bill directs the national coordinator to annually submit a report on their activities and the effectiveness and status of the Blue Alert plans that are in effect or being developed. Congressional Budget Office report The Congressional Budget Office report stated that \\"based on the costs of similar activities, CBO estimates that it would cost about $1 million annually from appropriated funds for DOJ to establish and administer the new program. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.\\" Procedural history House Rep. Michael Grimm (R-NY) introduced the National Blue Alert Act of 2013 on January 4, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. On January 25, 2013, it was referred to the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. The bill was reported by the House Judiciary Committee on May 7, 2013. On May 10, 2013, the bill had 14 co-sponsors - 8 Democrats and 6 Republicans. It passed the House on May 15, 2013 in Roll Call Vote 144: 406–2. Debate The National Association of Police Organizations, a lobbying group for American police organizations, wrote a letter to Rep. Michael Grimm in support of the National Blue Alert Act of 2013. In the letter, the organization's president argued that \\"creating a nationwide system to respond to criminal action against law enforcement officers will advance safety and improve communications across the law enforcement community\\". The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association endorsed and backed a reintroduction of the proposal in 2015.

History Páirc na Ropairí clubhouse The club was founded in 1917. Tá peil á imirt i nDoire Mhic Cais ó bunaíodh an CLG agus cuireadh tús leis an chlub sa bhliain 1911. Gaelic football has been played in Doire Mhic Cais from the very inception of the GAA and the Wolfe Tone club came into existence in 1911. The early teams competed in the South West Antrim League up until 1920, when the fight for independence had a negative impact on the Association across the country. The club was revived in 1924, when the great J.J. Murray, along with Charles McConville, John McCorry and Paddy McCann entered the club into numerous local competitions and J.J. formed the Lurgan League for teams from the north Armagh area. The Tones club was based at a practice field on Aghacommon Lane and competed in various leagues including the mid-Armagh League, the Lurgan and District League and the Armagh All-County League. In 1930, the Tones affiliated with the Armagh County Board and later that year, they defeated Armagh Tír na nÓg, to bring the Armagh Junior Championship to north Armagh for the first time. In 1938 the Tones won the North Armagh League and the Mac Oscar Cup followed in 1939. In 1943, a Wolfe Tones selection became the first team to bring the Armagh Senior Championship to north Armagh. In 1954, the Tones won the Armagh Senior League. In 1964, an amalgamated Tones and Sarsfields team won the Armagh Minor Championship under the name St Patrick's, which was a forerunner for the current Under 14 Doire Emmets team. The Tones senior football team competed in that year's County Senior Final but lost out to Mullaghbane and in 1966, the Tones finished runners-up in the All-County League to Crossmaglen. In 1967, the Tones once again reached the County Senior Final, but unfortunately lost again, but that year saw the club go undefeated through the All-County League. The Tones claimed the Armagh Junior Championship back in 2000 and any success on the football field has come from our underage teams since then. Bhí an t-ádh ar ár gcontae gur imir roinnt de mhórlaochra an chlub leo chomh maith. Our county benefitted from some of our more illustrious footballers with two Wolfe Tones greats, the late John McCarron and the late Bill McCorry providing the backbone for the county team who claimed the All-Ireland Junior Football Final in 1948. Bill went on to become the first Tones man to play for Armagh in an All-Ireland senior final in 1953, accompanied by panel member Seán Quinn, but it was the men from the Kingdom who got the upper hand that day. Unfortunately injury had ruled out John McCarron from playing that day. The late Noel Greene was the first Tones man to line out for the county minors in an All-Ireland final, back in 1957. It took a Tones man to bring the first All-Star award to the Orchard County, with Paddy Moriarty winning his first in 1972 and claiming a second in 1977 for his exploits in Armagh's run to the All-Ireland final. It is no surprise to anyone in the ‘Cash that Paddy's son Finnian lived up to his father's proud legacy and the club was extremely proud when Finnian helped to bring the Under 21 football championship to Armagh for the first time in 2004. A number of our players also have the distinction of representing Ulster in the Railway Cup with Bill McCorry and Seán Quinn being members of a victorious Ulster side, while Leo McAlinden won a Railway Cup medal for Connacht. Eddie McLaughlin and Alf Murray were also playing for the Tones when selected on Ulster teams and Paddy Moriarty represented the province, as well as a Combined Universities side and the All-Stars’ teams which travelled to America. Gaelic football Apart from the victory of a Tones-led selection in the 1943 Armagh Senior Football Championship final, defeating Crossmaglen, the club's highest point in sporting terms came in 1964, when the Tones lost by three points to Mullaghbawn in the SFC final. They had two other SFC final appearances, losing in 1967 to Crossmaglen by 9 points, and in 1973 to Clann na nGael by 15 points.Armagh GAA, Clár Oifigiúil, Craobh Sinsearach Peile (SFC final programme), 29 September 2012 The Tones have also won two JFC championships, in 1930 and 2000.

It is native to the Americas, including Mexico, parts of Central and South America, and the West Indies. It is perhaps better known in Hawaii, where it is an introduced species and an aggressive invasive weed with rapid negative effects on local ecosystems. In other parts of the United States it is used as an ornamental plant for its \\"tropical\\"-looking foliage. Description This relative of the poppy is a shrub growing up to 6 metres tall. It yields a bitter yellow or orange latex sap.Bocconia frutescens. From Motooka, P., et al. (2003). Weeds of Hawai‘i’s Pastures and Natural Areas; An Identification and Management Guide. College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai‘i at Manoa.Have you seen Bocconia (Bocconia frutescens)? Hawaii Biodiversity Information Network. The leaves are up to 45 cm long by 20 wide and the blades are divided into deep lobes. There are many leaves toward the ends of the branches. The inflorescence is a branching panicle up to 60 centimeters long. The purple- green flower lacks petals but has sepals each up to a centimetre long. The anthers dangle from the flower center by their filaments. The fruit is a capsule about 1.2 cm long containing yellowish pulp and a single black seed half-sheathed in a bright red aril. Ecology This plant is capable of thriving in many types of habitat. In its native range it grows in dry, moist, and wet forests on many soil types. It is known from cloud forests and several types of disturbed and degraded habitat. It is not, however, tolerant of dense shade. The seeds of the plant are generally dispersed by birds, which are attracted to the pulpy fruits. In Hawaii, the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) is a common visitor to the plant. In its native range it is also an important plant for various birds. Relationship with humans There are a number of human uses for this species, such as its use for ornamental purposes. It also has a variety of medicinal uses. In Mexico it has been used to treat skin conditions and respiratory tract infections. A laboratory study confirmed that extracts of the plant had antimicrobial action against the human pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as Bacillus subtilis. If the leaf is heated and applied to a wound it is said to provide pain relief. The plant can also be used as a dye. This plant grows quickly and is a prolific producer of seeds. It was introduced to Hawaii as a garden plant around 1920, and it promptly spread to the surrounding forests and other wild habitat. It is a problem on two of the Hawaiian islands, Hawaii and Maui. At one spot on Hawaii it moved from the local landscaping and soon covered over 3500 acres of abandoned agricultural fields. It is a common weed of other crop fields nearby. It easily invades eucalyptus plantations and areas of forest already dominated by non-native trees and shrubs. It is a weed of roadsides, vacant lots, and residential areas.Benitez, D. M. and D. Saulibio. (2007). Bocconia frutescens Distribution on the Island of Hawai'i. Technical Report 144. Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit. University of Hawaii at Manoa. It is tolerant of Hawaii's lava soils. On Maui it has been observed at elevations near 5800 feet. It is one of the noxious plants posing a threat to the native and rare flora of Kanaio Natural Area Reserve. The plant is thick and bushy, producing multiple stems at times and spreading densely to produce \\"carpets\\" that shade out smaller plants. Native species negatively affected include Melicope adscendens, Alectryon macrococcus, Bonamia menziesii, Cenchrus agrimonioides, Flueggea neowawraea, Melicope knudsenii, Santalum freycinetianum var. lanaiense, and Nothocestrum latifolium, a host plant of the federally endangered Blackburn’s sphinx moth (Manduca blackburni). Herbicides are a commonly recommended method of control for this species, particularly triclopyr. Small seedlings can be pulled by hand; larger seedlings root firmly and break if pulled, resprouting soon after. Effective control is difficult because of the plant's ability to sprout back up after being cleared off the land. Heavy machinery should be cleaned after digging in infested areas to prevent the transfer of seeds. Aerial monitoring of vulnerable areas is also recommended.

United has pressed records for such artists as The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Jack White, Adele, Mumford & Sons, Hank Williams Jr., Marie Osmond, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Lady Antebellum, Justin Timberlake, Kanye West, Kings of Leon, Fall Out Boy, Kendrick Lamar, The Black Keys, The Roots, and Radiohead. Today it is the largest vinyl record pressing plant in the United States.  Company history  United Record Pressing in 2013 United was founded by Ozell Simpkins, John Dunn, and Joe Talbot under the name \\"Southern Plastics\\" in 1949, the same year that RCA introduced the 45 rpm record. They found success by working with large labels like Motown to produce 45 rpm singles for jukeboxes and the everyday consumer. In 1962, the company moved to its current location at 453 Chestnut Street from 512 Franklin Street in Nashville, Tennessee. This is the building where United would be contracted by Vee Jay Records to press The Beatles first 7-inch records in North America. The building and the machine presses inside of it were all designed by Ozell Simpkins after he spent two months in Brussels, Belgium researching modern pressing plants. A majority of these machines only pressed 45s. United gained the ability to press 12-inchers when they bought the presses from Dixie Record Pressing, another Nashville plant that was winding down. In 1971, under new management, the name was changed from \\"Southern Plastics\\" to United Record Pressing.  Motown Suite  When United first opened the doors at the Chestnut location in 1962, the South was still segregated. Many of the African American customers, executives, and musicians had trouble finding hotels or restaurants that would offer them service. Two of United's biggest clients were Motown and Vee-Jay Records, both labels run by people of color. In response to that, the company built the United Hilton Suite, which would later go on to be known as The Motown Suite. This suite is an area on the second floor of the building that is an apartment-style living space. This area is still viewable to guests touring the plant. It has the same furnishings that were offered to the visiting patrons back in the 1960s. This includes a common room with a bar, plenty of seating for guests, a full bathroom, a double-occupancy bedroom, a kitchen equipped with an old push-button stove and other novel 60s decor. URP still uses the kitchen as a conference room, having staff meetings while sitting around the same table that the executives and artists used.  Upstairs  Next to the Motown Suite on the second floor of the building is a large space that is used to host record release parties and other events for labels and artists. Among the many, it is believed that this room hosted parties for The Supremes, Smokey Robinson, The Cowsills, Wayne Newton, and a signing party for a 16-year-old Hank Williams, Jr. It also functions as a small museum to the company and the history of recorded music. Among other uses, this room houses the Upstairs at United series. Upstairs at United is a series of all-analog recordings recorded on the second floor of United. All recordings were direct to analog tape under the leadership Chis Mara of Welcome to 1979 Studios, then cut to 12-inch EPs at 45 RPM. The purpose of the Upstairs at United series is to put out music recorded in an all-analog style, and to celebrate the outstanding musical and cultural history that has taken place inside this building. All recordings are engineered by Mara and his analog studio in Nashville, Tennessee. All recordings were done live directly to one-fourth- inch analog tape using a sixteen-channel vintage recording console and vintage microphones and outboard gear, with no overdubs, edits or audio sweetening. The series has included artists such as Brendan Benson, North Mississippi Allstars, Keane (band), and Smoke Fairies.  Innovations  Together with various clients including Third Man Records, United has pioneered new innovations to the vinyl world such as: * Various unique vinyl sizes including 5\\", 8\\", 13\\" * Liquid center vinyl - A record that contains a small amount of colored water in its center section. * Triple-decker record - A 12-inch vinyl that contains a 7\\" inside its center section. The 12\\" must be broken to reach the 7\\". * Tri-color vinyl - A record that has three separate colors in the same disk. * Under the Label Grooves - A record where a playable song has been pressed underneath the paper of the center label. * The Automated Dual-Color Record Press - Due to high demand for split color vinyl, United fabricated an existing press to take from two different color sources to create a press that could automate the split color process.

Witkowski (16 August 1860, Yazlovets, now Buchach Raion - 17 May 1910) was a Polish-American portraitist and genre painter, better known in the US as Karl Witkowski. He painted scenes of contemporary daily life in America. Biography Jazłowiec & Czortków in Eastern Galicia Karol Dominik Witkowskihttp://www.artinfo.pl/?pid=publications&sp;=artinformations&id;=372&lng;=1 was born to a Polish family in Jazłowiec (Jaslowiec), near Buchach, Czortków (Podole, Poland, now Ukraine). As young boy he showed unusual talent in making drawings and his parents sent him to school in Chortkiv (12 miles from Yazlovets). In 1879 he enlisted in the Austrian Army (in 19th century southern Poland was occupied by Austria and named Galicia), where he gained popularity by making portraits of his fellow soldiers and commanding officers, including a portrait of General Duke William of Württemberg and portrait of Lieutenant Field Marshal Emanuel Salomon of Friedberg - Mírohorsky (this army officer also was a genre painter, it is possible, why later in USA Karl Witkowski became genre painter). In 1880 Witkowski left the army and moved to Kraków, where from 1881 to 1883 he studied arts at the Academy of Fine Arts under the directorship of Jan Matejko. Witkowski also studied arts in Munich under Karl von Piloty. Around 1884 Witkowski emigrated from Poland, like many others, and went to America, where he stayed for three years. During that time he created his first famous paintings of young people. In 1887 he left America and arrived in France. In Paris Witkowski studied at the Julian Academyhttps://sites.google.com/site/academiejulian/w/witkowski (1887-1888) and continued to work on paintings and portraits. Most of his paintings done there he signed with the added initial of author's second name (K.D. Witkowski). Some of Witkowski's painting done in France: Portrait de Tomas Milatycki, Mother with Children. In 1889 Witkowski returned to America and stayed for over 20 years until his death. During those years, besides portraits of the elite in New York City and Newark areas, he made over 200 paintings of young people (mostly newsboys and shoeshine boys), their daily life, at work and at play, often with their pets. The style of these paintings recalls the style of John George Brown to some extent. Most of these paintings were signed ”K. Witkowski”. From 1891 until his death his paintings were available for sale at various auctions and picture galleries of New York City area. For some time he had his own studio in Brooklyn, New York (1903). Upon his arrival in the United States in 1884, Witkowski lived in New York City (from 1884 to 1887 and again from 1889 to 1891), later moving to Newark in 1891, and then to Irvington, South Orange, and Vailsburg, Newark. Witkowski died on May 17, 1910, in Newark, from blood poisoning, survived by his wife. Witkowski died at the height of his artistic powers. In 1909 he registered 8 paintings through the United States Copyright Office and in just a few months of 1910 he created and registered 14 pieces more, also in the last months of his life, he exhibited his work at the State Fair of Texas and galleries of New York City. Paintings Karl Witkowski painted the elite in Newark (New Jersey, USA) and his skills as a portraitist to the wealthy were always in demand. But ironically it was his paintings of newsboys and street urchins in the same city that brought him lasting recognition. His paintings of children are remarkable for their odd combination of sentimentalism and realism. Karl Witkowski as an eminent European artist gave an entirely new study in American newsboy life, his paintings have a characteristic humor and brightness, they are serious or humorous.

Fluorenylidene has the unusual property that the triplet ground state is only 1.1 kcal/mol (4.6 kJ/mol) lower in energy than the singlet state. For this reason, fluorenylidene has been studied extensively in organic chemistry. Fluorenylidene is a reactive intermediate. Reactions involving fluorenylidene proceed through either the triplet or singlet state carbene, and the products formed depend on the relative concentration of spin states in solution, as influenced by experimental conditions. The rate of intersystem crossing is determined by the temperature and concentration of specific spin- trapping agents.  Structure  Intersystem crossing and associated spin- state orbitals of Fluorenylidene. The ground state is believed to be a bent triplet, with two orthogonal sp hybrid orbitals singly occupied by unpaired spins. One electron occupies an orbital of sigma symmetry in the plane of the rings, while the other occupies an orbital of pi symmetry, which interacts with the pi systems of the adjacent aromatic rings (delocalization into the rings is minimal, since zero-field parameter D is high). The zero field splitting parameters predict a bond angle greater than 135°, and since the ideal bond geometry for cyclopentane carbons is about 109°, considerable ring strain causes the methylene sigma bonds to be bent. In the singlet state, the spin-paired electrons occupy the sp2 hybrid orbital, orthogonal to an empty p-orbital. Conversion of singlet to triplet fluorenylidene is achieved through intersystem crossing (ISC).  Generation of Fluorenylidene  thumb350pxSynthesis of fluorenylidene from thermolysis or photolysis of 9-diazofluorene (DAF) Fluorenylidene can be produced by photolysis of 9-diazofluorene (DAF). Ultra-fast (300 fs) time resolved laser-flash photolysis of DAF implicates a four-step process in the formation of fluorenylidene by irradiation of 9-diazofluorene. # Irradiation of DAF initially yields an excited singlet state diazofluorene molecule ( 1DAF*) # 1DAF* decays to form the open shell carbene,1FL*, as the minor product, and the less energetic closed shell carbene, 1FL, as the major product. # Any excited singlet 1FL* in solution relaxes to the lower energy singlet state 1FL (20.9 ps) # 1FL equilibrates with the ground state triplet 3FL by intersystem crossing.  Reaction of Fluorenylidene in Solution  Fluorenylidene reacts with olefins as predicted by the Skell-Woodworth rules. The stereochemistry of cycloaddition products depends on the relative rates of cyclopropanation (or other reactions) and intersystem crossing. Stabilization of specific spin states, and, by extension, increased stereospecificity can be achieved by using solvents of different polarities . Examples of various reaction routes of fluorenylidene in solution  Triplet Fluorenylidene Reactivity  Triplet fluorenylidene reacts with olefins in a stepwise fashion to produce a racemic mixture, provided that the rate of spin inversion (intersystem crossing) is not significantly faster than rates of intermediate bond rotation.  Singlet Fluorenylidene Reactivity  Donation of lone pair electrons into the vacant p-orbital of singlet fluorenylidene. Singlet fluorenylidene reacts with olefins in a concerted fashion, maintaining the stereochemistry of the reactant olefin. Triplet quenchers such as butadiene solvents can be used to increase stereospecific yields. Halogenated solvents also stabilize the singlet state. For example, dibromomethane and hexafluorobenzene deactivate the higher-energy singlet state, decelerating the rate of intersystem crossing in accordance with earlier studies of diphenylcarbene. The mechanism of singlet state deactivation is theorized to occur through halogen-lone pair complexation of empty 1Fl P-orbitals.

The bill primarily listed a series of Congressional \\"findings\\" regarding the internet, its use, and the way it has been governed. Finally, the bill affirms that \\"it is the policy of the United States to preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs the Internet.\\" Provisions/Elements of the bill This section is primarily composed of the exact text of H.R. 1580 as it was first introduced. SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The 113th United States Congress finds the following: :(1) Given the importance of the Internet to the global economy, it is essential that the Internet remain stable, secure, and free from government control. :(2) The world deserves the access to knowledge, services, commerce, and communication, the accompanying benefits to economic development, education, and health care, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock of democratic self-government that the Internet provides. :(3) The structure of Internet governance has profound implications for competition and trade, democratization, free expression, and access to information. :(4) Countries have obligations to protect human rights, whether exercised online or offline. :(5) The ability to innovate, develop technical capacity, grasp economic opportunities, and promote freedom of expression online is best realized in cooperation with all stakeholders. :(6) Proposals have been, and will likely continue to be, put forward at international regulatory bodies that would fundamentally alter the governance and operation of the Internet. :(7) The proposals would attempt to justify increased government control over the Internet and could undermine the current multistakeholder model that has enabled the Internet to flourish and under which the private sector, civil society, academia, and individual users play an important role in charting its direction. :(8) The proposals would diminish the freedom of expression on the Internet in favor of government control over content. :(9) The position of the United States Government has been and is to advocate for the flow of information free from government control. :(10) This Administration and past Administrations have made a strong commitment to the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and the promotion of the global benefits of the Internet. SEC. 2. POLICY REGARDING INTERNET GOVERNANCE. It is the policy of the United States to preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs the Internet. End legislation text. Procedural history House H.R. 1580 was introduced into the House of Representatives by Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) on April 16, 2013. The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and then the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology. As of May 13, 2013, the bill had 32 co-sponsors, all of them original co-sponsors that had signed up as co- sponsors on April 16, 2013. Of these co-sponsors, 26 were Republicans and 6 were Democrats. A Congressional Budget Office report from May 2, 2013, indicated that \\"based on information from the Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would not have an effect on spending subject to appropriation because the workloads of those agencies would not be affected.\\" The bill was reported out of committee on May 3, 2013, alongside House Report 113-50. The House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced on Friday May 10, 2013, that H.R. 1580 would be considered the following week. Debate and discussion The Internet Association, a lobbying organization, released a statement on April 18, 2013 expressing its support for the legislation. In their statement, they argued that \\"the unique nature of the Internet – free from government control and governed by multiple stakeholders – has unleashed unprecedented entrepreneurialism, creativity, innovation, and freedom far beyond imagination. Preserving a free Internet for all people is essential to the preservation of political and economic liberty.\\" Section 2 of the legislation text was altered during the committee process in order to gain support from Congressional Democrats. The original concluding statement of the bill included the phrase \\"free from government control\\" seen in the Discussion Draft. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) stated that Democrats objected to the language because they fears it would restrict the Federal Communications Commission and its ability to enforce its own rules of network neutrality.

Produced by and starring the Taylor brothers, Josh's wife Kelli, and Jordan's wife Sara, the channel targets the idiosyncrasies of conservative Christianity, youth group, romantic relationships, homeschooling, politics, and social media. Blimey Cow experienced a major surge in popularity after the video \\"Seven Lies About Homeschoolers\\" went viral. Musician Derek Webb, Colin Kimble of As Cities Burn, and John Reuben have all made appearances on Blimey Cow after discovering the channel. In addition to these appearances, the channel has received attention from musician Michael Gungor, authors Lew Rockwell and Thomas Woods, and various media outlets and programs such as The 700 Club, The Christian Post, The Huffington Post, Metro, Today, and WKRN-TV. History Early history The brothers began filming videos in 2005. At a young age, their father taught them how to shoot videos and use special effects in an effort to demonstrate that movie violence, which had frightened the brothers, was fake. The brothers initially filmed using a simple home video camera, and posted their videos on Google Video, which eventually merged with YouTube when Google acquired the latter. According to Josh, Jordan's favorite word at the time was \\"cow\\", and the brothers had a friend who frequently said \\"blimey\\", so the words were merged to create \\"Blimey Cow\\". Influenced by The Office, Napoleon Dynamite, and Christopher Guest, the Taylor brothers adopted a mockumentary style. In 2007, Colin Cimble of the band As Cities Burn appeared in an episode of the show Jordan's Messyges. The activity by the brothers declined once Josh started college and met his future wife Kelli, and Jordan finished up high school. Re-launch and early popularity In 2011, Josh had married Kelli and Jordan entered college. Josh convinced Jordan to create one video every week. They launched this new series, featuring Jordan addressing various topics, under the title of \\"Messy Mondays\\", modeled after a previous series, Jordan's Messyges. Messy Mondays debuted on August 29, 2011 with the video \\"New School Year\\". A few minor hits emerged, specifically \\"The One About Mission Trips\\", \\"3 Types of Churches\\", \\"10 Ways to Get a Girl to Like You\\", and \\"The Truth About Youth Group\\". The video \\"The One About Mission Trips\\" critiqued short-term missions and suggested that the money raised could fund longer-term missions. Josh stated that while it generated some negative feedback from state-side viewers, missionaries in other countries praised the video for addressing this issue. The videos \\"3 Types of Churches\\", \\"10 Ways to Get a Girl to Like You\\", and \\"The Truth About Youth Group\\" each brought in about 3,000 views per week. Viral breakthrough On January 16, 2012, Blimey Cow released the Messy Mondays video \\"Seven Lies About Homeschoolers\\". The video received over one million views in under a week. And it is currently at 2.2 million views. In February, the Christian Broadcasting Network picked up the video, interviewing Jordan Taylor on The 700 Club during a segment on homeschooling. On April 24, 2012, historian and author Thomas Woods interviewed Josh Taylor while guest hosting The Peter Schiff Show. Two days later, author, former Congressional staffer Lew Rockwell posted the homeschooling video on his website LewRockwell.com, and in July he interviewed Josh Taylor on his podcast The Lew Rockwell Show. Following the success of the homeschooling video, Blimey Cow formed a YouTube partnership and signed up for Google advertising to generate revenue. Subsequent success On August 2, 2012, the Korean edition of Christian Today noted the Messy Mondays video \\"10 Ways to Get the Right Guy to Like You\\", uploaded on January 23, 2012, in an online article on Christian dating. The following year, on February 3, Blimey Cow released another highly successful Messy Mondays video, \\"How to Write a Worship Song (In 5 Minutes or Less)\\". By February 4, the video surged to the top five most popular currently watched videos on YouTube, and by February 7, the video garnered 213,000 views. The episode was written and conceived by Canadian musician Garrett Vandenberg. The video received highly positive feedback, including Twitter shout-outs from individuals in the music industry. Jeff Cruz of 89.7 WMHK said the video was \\"remarkably accurate and incredibly sad at same time.\\" Post-rock musician Michael Gungor called the video \\"brilliant\\" and said he would have to see more of Blimey Cow's material. Singer-songwriter Derek Webb stated that the video \\"is as funny as it is true. Which makes it not funny.\\" This flurry of Twitter activity caught the attention of The Christian Post, which published a story about the video on February 7, 2013. On March 24, Derek Webb made a guest appearance in the video \\"The Top 15 Christian Cliches\\". The following day, WKRN-TV posted an article about the Taylors and their success. On April 29, 2013, Blimey Cow released the video \\"Why I Hate Going to Graduations\\", about which The Huffington Post posted a short article the following day. The next week, the members of the band Pompton Lakes appeared in the opening and closing scenes for the video \\"Ten Things You Should Never Say to a Guy\\". This video emerged as the most popular YouTube video for 13–17-year-old females in May 2013, according to TheBlaze. The video \\"I Like You in Real Life (But Not on the Internet)\\", uploaded on May 26, attracted the attention of several media outlets. Mashable posted a short story on the video on May 28, and on May 30, Today host Willie Geist mentioned the channel while discussing social media etiquette with business woman Randi Zuckerberg. On June 5, 2013, Metro based an article on the video, and interviewed Josh on the issue of internet behavior. In May 2017, Christian rapper John Reuben made an appearance on the channel. Kickstarter campaign and BCAN In March and April 2013, Blimey Cow successfully ran a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for equipment to begin an audio podcast. The project reached its $1,700 goal in 40 minutes. By the end of the campaign, nearly $17,000 had been raised and the plan evolved into what was called the Blimey Cow Audio Network, or BCAN. Financial supporters of the Kickstarter received Blimey Cow merchandise, such as T-shirts, stickers and special recordings. Personal biographies Jordan Taylor Jordan grew up attending small churches with his family, and he and Josh involved themselves in youth groups and Vacation Bible School, experiences which inspire much of the content on their channel. After homeschooling through highschool, Jordan attended Cumberland University before transferring to Trevecca Nazarene University, where he majored in English with a creative writing minor. While at Cumberland, he rode in the University cycling team, and now cycles as a hobby. Jordan started his own YouTube channel in 2015, which has 138 thousand subscribers as of November 2018. On June 26, 2015, he released an album, Long Drive. In May 2017, Jordan married Sara Bonham. Josh Taylor When Josh was a teenager, he wrote some reviews for the Christian music website Jesus Freak Hideout. In addition to his writing and photo work on the website, he and the website founder, John DiBiase, created a mockumentary series entitled \\"The Hideout\\" which fictionally portrayed the office life at Jesus Freak Hideout. Josh holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mass communications with a focus on television and radio. From 2009 to 2010 while in college, he hosted a nightly radio show The Evening Blend on the now defunct 89.1 FM WNAZ. Upon graduating, he worked as a master control operator for WHTN before taking on a job, helping his father as a patent artist for local attorneys. He now does Blimey Cow full- time. Josh also does planning for Disney World vacations, and runs the podcasts The Inner Tube and Who Would Build the Roads with co-host Kevin McCreary. Several of his characters on the channel include: College Josh, Twitter Troll Josh, Youth Pastor Josh and liberalist Josh. Kelli Taylor Kelli grew up in a family of five and was homeschooled from third grade on. When she first met Josh, Kelli says that he acted \\"very dorky\\" and gave her one of the joke CDs that he and Jordan made. In addition to her work with Blimey Cow, Kelli enjoys writing, photography, cooking, planning, movies, friends, and food, and maintains a blog, \\"Currently Kelli\\".

Born in Haverhill, Mass and raised in Atkinson, New Hampshire, he was part of the thriving arts scene of the 1970s and 1980s in Chicago and New York City, where he became part of a community of artists that included Keith Haring and Andy Warhol, before moving to San Francisco in 1989. His metal work was exhibited at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian in 1974, 1981 and 1984, and the American Crafts Museum, NYC in 1983, 1984 and 1986. Among Albair’s chief influences are Ken Botto, Ray Johnson and Man Ray, whose work both as a jewelry designer and a photographer served as model for his own inclinations, as well as Marcel Duchamp. In the 90s his work was shown in Seattle, Denver, New York and London. In 2008 he mounted his show, Stranger in a Dream at the Kathmandu Photo Gallery in Bangkok Thailand. His continued interest in “blurring the reality between what’s real and what’s realistic,” resulted in a book, Hidden Gardens Private Views published in 2010, which then led to another show in Bangkok, Beneath the Veneer in 2011.  Early life and education  After receiving his undergraduate and post graduate degrees from Illinois State University, Albair began teaching and received his first recognition in Chicago, aka the “city of the big shoulders” according to poet Carl Sandburg, when he was awarded 2nd prize by the Art Institute of Chicago in their 1973 Chicago and Vicinity Artists Exhibition. In the late 70s Tiffany & Co, Chicago displayed two of his sculptural works in their windows. Albair’s early life was tumultuous from the get-go, as soon after their birth he and his twin sister Jeanne (Gariepy), were moved to a foster home in Atkinson, New Hampshire, followed by stays in numerous other homes, as well as a year together in an orphanage from ages 7–8. After living with the Albair family for 2 years in Atkinson, New Hampshire blocks away from his sister, Albair chose adoption at age 14. Despite not living together as teenagers, he and his sister Jeanne attended Haverhill, High School together for three years. In his senior year he quit high school to enter the United States Air Force. While in the military, he gained a GED certificate attending the University of Illinois before being discharged from the Air Force in 1965. It wasn’t until his mid- twenties that he began to study and experiment with art.Beneath the Veneer, 2011 Dream Within a Dream, 2011 Hidden Gardens - Private Views (book cover image), 2009 These early experiences, his close relationship with his sister, and his time spent teaching account for much of the imagery he has produced. Though no specific autobiographical images have entered his work, these experiences set the stage for the themes of love, loss and longing that pervade much of his output.  Career  Beginning as a goldsmith, Albair’s interest in narrative is ongoing and palpable. Starting with so-called narrative jewelry in the 1970s—based on the centuries-old idea of using jewelry to tell a story—his initial works combined disparate materials and objects in order to produce pieces of what the Chicago Daily News said transmitted \\"both humor and whimsy, and which could be worn as jewelry or seen as art objects in and of themselves.” Albair became interested in tableau photography via a close friend and working relationship with Ken Botto, often described as an eccentric who created staged tableaux of toys and found objects set in a political or psychological context in order to photograph them. Prior to moving to San Francisco in 1990, Albair enjoyed academic or lecture positions with a number of institutions, beginning with Western Illinois University and including The New School in New York City, Parsons School of Design, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Columbia University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and Texas A & M. In addition he showed work at a number of galleries, including the American Crafts Museum in New York, the Smithsonian Institution’s Renwick Gallery, and the La Mama Galleria in New York. Once ensconced in San Francisco his pursuit of tableau photography took up the majority of his artistic energy. Over the next fifteen years he showed at a number of galleries in the Bay Area and began to teach at Las Positas College in Livermore California. In 2007 his work caught the eye of San Francisco’s 7x7 magazine. In the article entitled Idol Worship written by Melissa Goldstein, Albair compared his work to sculpture, because of his great emphasis on “stage direction” in the setting up of his tableaux. When pressed, he admitted “one of the things I try to build into all these pieces is a sense of longing for something that is not there.” In 2008 he mounted his show, Stranger in a Dream at the Kathmandu Photo Gallery in Bangkok Thailand. His continued interest in “blurring the reality between what’s real and what’s realistic,” produced a collection of pieces featured in his book, Hidden Gardens Private Views published in 2010, and resulted in another show in Bangkok, Beneath the Veneer at the Thavibu Gallery in 2011. Besides Ken Botto, major influences on Albair’s work includes Ray Johnson, Man Ray, (whose work as both a jewelry designer and a photographer served as model for his own inclinations) along with Marcel Duchamp.

Wikis are adaptable to use by any cross-geographical comparative study, such as comparative politics, comparative religion. Examples Over the past decade, there have been several attempts to create a global legal wiki, though as of April 2017 none have gained primacy. Examples include the World Encyclopedia of Law, by LAWi and Wex, the online legal encyclopedia created by Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute. Parallel efforts to create crowdsourced data structures to map global legal/regulatory authorities include projects like Intellipedia, an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the United States Intelligence Community (IC).  Usefulness  Comparative law wikis are an efficient method of performing comparative legal analysis. Wikis are particularly useful for comparative global analysis because of the use with which sources from multiple jurisdictions can be gathered in one place. Crowdsourcing permits gathering up-to-date legal authorities from contributors who have local expertise, particularly knowledge of languages and administrative structures that background implementation of particular legal/regulatory norms. Comparative law wikis can also be useful for comparative study in federal legal systems, such as in the U.S., where 50-state law surveys are particularly useful.

The fort is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, with a list entry identification number of 1005698.Historic England. Castle Rings has been dated to the Iron Age and is situated at an altitude of upon Upper Greensand sandstone beds. The main bulk of the fort enclosure lies within the boundaries of Donhead St Mary parish but some of the outlying earthworks are situated in the neighbouring Sedgehill and Semley parish.Historic England. Ordnance Survey 2010. In the mid-1980s a metal detectorist unearthed a hoard of stater coins of the Durotriges tribe within the hill fort.Frere et al 1987, p. 347. Lady Theodora Grosvenor described the fort in her 1867 book Motcombe, Past and Present: Physical characteristics Exterior of rampart on the north side The rampart of the fort stands high with a deep ditch; the ditch is set between double earth banks. The ditch averages wide and varies in depth to a maximum of . The inner rampart has an average width of and stands above the internal surface level of the fort.Historic England 2007. The fort measures (NS by EW), enclosing an area of . There is a counter-scarp bank that averages wide and varies in height from at the southwest to between at the northeast; at the southwest this bank is high enough to give the impression of a bivallate fort. There are four gaps in the ramparts, one in each of the cardinal directions, but it is not known if these were original entrances to the fort. The east and west gaps are suspected of being the original entrances while the narrower gaps on the north and south sides are thought to be modern field entrances. The roughly oval rampart of the fort is overgrown with trees and bushes. The interior of Castle Rings is flat and used for pasture; there is no visible evidence of Iron Age occupation. Western outlier Outlying earthwork in Crates Wood An outlying earthwork lies approximately to the west of the main rampart; it crosses the ridge in a north-south direction, ending at natural scarp slopes in both directions. It extends in a curve for , running almost parallel to the rampart of the fort. The outlier extends across fields but is more clearly marked towards the north end within Crates Wood where it reaches a maximum height of , with a deep ditch on its west side. The bank is up to wide and the ditch measures wide. On its east side the earthwork's scarp stands high and forms a field boundary. At the south end where it crosses fields the bank is much reduced by ploughing, with a maximum height of and traces of a ploughed- out ditch. Coin find A metal detectorist recovered a hoard of stater coins from within Castle Rings and was subsequently fined for looting a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The coins, which are attributed to the Durotriges, are now in the collection of the British Museum. They were dug up on 13 October 1985 with twelve ceramic fragments;Cowell et al 1987, pp. 9-10. 88 coins were found in all, some 30 of these were said to be contained within the broken pottery. The finds were handed over to the police and on 17 February 1987 were declared treasure trove by an inquest,Cowell et al 1987, p. 9. which found that the metal detectorist had excavated a deep hole into the upper section of the outer bank and therefore the find fell within the bounds of the scheduled monument. The finder was prosecuted under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979; he was found guilty and fined £100 (equivalent to £ in modern currency). The find was offered for sale to the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum, which refused the purchase on the grounds that it neither wished to financially reward a looter nor acquire looted artefacts. In the event, the British Museum paid the finder an amount considerably greater than the fine in order to acquire the hoard and prevent it being returned to the finder; it held that the academic value of the collected hoard outweighed the concerns regarding its acquisition. The ceramic fragments formed a small necked beaker manufactured on a potter's wheel some time after AD 80 and is of a Roman type dated to after AD 200. The pottery also contained highly corroded remnants of bronze, copper and silver. The coins have been dated to between 60 and 20 BC;British Museum. Cowell et al 1987, p. 10. there is therefore a mismatch between the late date of the pottery and the pre-Roman coins found within it. It has been suggested that the vessel originally contained a small hoard of mixed metal artefacts but how the Iron Age Durotrigian coins ended up in the Romano-British hoard cannot be explained.Cowell et al 1987, p. 10.

Original plans were for the arena to be built next to Bristol Temple Meads railway station in Bristol, England, and was expected to be completed in 2020. The site, which has become known as 'Arena Island', is to the south and across the River Avon from the station, and lies within Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone. The funding package for the arena scheme was approved by Bristol City Council in February 2014. The winning design, by Populous, was revealed in March 2015. With the opening of the First Direct Arena in Leeds in the summer of 2013, Bristol became the largest city in the United Kingdom without a large arena-style venue. As of late 2013, Bristol's two largest music venues are the Colston Hall and the O2 Academy, which both hold around 2,000 people each. In January 2017 a new contractor had to be sought following a failure to agree build costs. In September 2018 the plans to build the arena near Temple Meads were abandoned, primarily on cost and risk grounds. In 2019, YTL Corporation released details regarding their proposal to build the arena at the former Filton Airfield site. Background Initial plans for Bristol Arena were announced in March 2003. The arena, to be built next to Bristol's largest railway station Temple Meads, was planned to have 10,000 seats and host music concerts as well as sports and conferences, and was intended to open by 2008 to coincide with the city's bid to be the European Capital of Culture. In June 2007, work had yet to begin on the arena despite around £13 million spent to purchase and clear the site. In late 2007, the plans were abandoned after developers announced that £40 million of public sector money would be required to fund the arena in addition to the £46m that had already been committed by Bristol City Council and the South West of England Regional Development Agency. By 2009, plans for Bristol Arena were back on the agenda with two plans put forward. One plan, similar to plans for the site next to Temple Meads, was supported by the architect and future mayor, George Ferguson. The other plan, supported by Bristol City Council, was to build an arena next to Bristol City's proposed stadium at Ashton Vale. A number of legal challenges to Bristol City's proposed stadium caused the council to reconsider plans for an arena on the originally preferred site next to Temple Meads in 2012. The site, which used to be the location of the Bristol Bath Road depot, was owned by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). It is the biggest undeveloped site in Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, an enterprise zone launched in 2012. In 2013 the HCA agreed to fund an £11 million road bridge over the River Avon, to link the site to Cattle Market Road and the railway station. The HCA transferred ownership of the arena site to Bristol City Council in March 2015. Construction of the bridge took place from March to September 2015. It has lanes for cars, bicycles and pedestrians. In March 2016, it was named Brock's Bridge, after William Brock (1830–1907), a local builder and entrepreneur. Once elected mayor, Ferguson launched a competition to find the best design for a 12,000 seat arena that would be \\"the most environmentally-friendly venue of its kind\\" and pledged that the project would be up and running within four years. This was followed by a bid to win £80 million from the government's Regional Growth Fund to partially fund the project and pay for renovations at Colston Hall, which ultimately proved unsuccessful. Initial proposal In February 2014, the funding package for the arena scheme was approved as part of Bristol City Council's budget. The total cost of the arena, £91 million, would be funded by the council which would have provided £38 million with the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership funding the remaining £53 million. In November 2014, the five shortlisted architects for the contract to design the arena were announced. The winning design by Populous, beating designs by Grimshaw Architects LLP, Idom Ingeniería y Consultoría, White Arkitekter and Wilkinson Eyre, was revealed in March 2015. The arena had been designed to achieve a BREEAM 'Excellent' rating and would've been able to quickly convert from a number of different layouts, with capacities ranging from 4,000 to 12,000. The preferred operators, SMG Europe and Live Nation, were announced in December 2014. Artist impression of the original planned Arena near Temple Meads railway station In March 2016, the arena plans suffered a further setback when the City's planning committee described the proposals as \\"defective\\" and deferred making a decision on them until an appropriate level of supporting information could be provided. Public concern over parking and transport around the proposals had not been properly addressed and the committee were not confident in the detail submitted for approval. George Ferguson claimed the planning committee had put the entire project at risk and the decision was \\"not about planning, it was about politics.\\" Following multiple updates to the transport plan, the arena was granted planning permission in April 2016 with the planning committee unanimously in favour of the updated plans. In January 2017, the projected opening of the arena was delayed to 2020 after Bristol City Council and preferred construction firm Bouygues UK failed to agree on construction costs. Three months later, it was announced that Buckingham Group, who had initially been the second preferred bidder, would carry out preliminary work on the site while negotiating a final price. Bristol City Council have also commissioned an independent review into the project's value for money. In November 2017, the Bristol Post revealed plans to construct the arena within the Brabazon Hangar at the former Filton Airfield on the edge of the city's boundary. In September 2018, Mayor Marvin Rees scrapped the arena plans in favour of a mixed use development, leaving the Brabazon Hangar as the only option, although this is unlikely. The primary reasons given for the decision were build cost, future financial risk and job creation. The build cost for the council had increased to £150 million plus half of any cost overruns. Costs arising should the arena not be successful would be to the council, and expert advice was that the venue size was too small for major events. Rees also argued a mixed use development would create more and better paid jobs. Car parking Criticism of the Temple Quarter arena plans had often been aimed at the low number of dedicated car parking spaces on site. Initial plans revealed there would be just 245 spaces on site, 200 of which would be in a temporary facility which would eventually be developed into offices, apartments and retail space. George Ferguson defended the plans, saying \\"it would be completely mad, completely mad, to put a mass of parking on the site.\\" In February 2016, Bristol City Council denied it had performed a u-turn after it emerged an eight-storey, 480 space car park was to be considered for the site. Current plans The main hangar where the arena will be built inside (September 2019) The owner of the former Bristol Filton Airport, YTL Corporation, announced plans in early 2019 for a 17,000 seat indoor arena in the former Brabazon hangar, in partnership with Avison Young, Grimshaw and MANICA Architecture. The “unique seating bowl” design of the arena would allow for flexible capacity ranging from 4,000 to 17,000. Plans include a walkway modelled after Wembley Way, 36 'Brabazon Steps' and a 75m bridge over the Henbury Loop railway line. The new entrance for the arena in the central hangar will be raised above the existing floor, looking out over the runway. The east and west hangars will be transformed into a Festival Hall and 'The Hub'. Festival Hall will host exhibitions and conventions as well as large scale events. The Hub will consist of small or start-up businesses, food and drink outlets, and leisure facilities. The former airfield site has been earmarked by South Gloucestershire Council for 2,675 new homes. This new suburb, to be called Brabazon, will begin construction in 2020 with first residents arriving in 2021.

Gordon,Arnold Taylor, 'Icelandic in the English Universities', Saga-Book, 14 (1953-57), 1-11 (9). he spent the spring of 1933 as an exchange student in Iceland. In 1934 he took his MA at Manchester, writing on Droplaugarsona saga, and then spent a further year there gaining a teaching certificate. During these years, he continued to spend much of his time in Iceland, meeting his future wife Sigríður Ásgeirsdóttir (1911–91) there in 1935. After holding a substitute teaching position in Ashton under Lyne in 1937, Taylor went to Germany as an assistant professor of English at the University of Jena from 1937–39, followed by a year of high-school teaching at Darlington. Second World War With the outbreak of war, Arnold volunteered his German skills to the British army, but with an even greater lack of soldiers knowing Icelandic, he was posted to Iceland in 1940. In 1941 he met Sigríður again, and they married in Reykjavík in March 1942, moving to England later that year. Arnold continued both to fight and translate in North Africa, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands until the summer of 1946, when he returned to high-school teaching in County Durham. University of Leeds In January 1947 Arnold began the career which dominated his life, gaining a lectureship in the English Department at the University of Leeds, where he succeeded Bruce Dickins (who had himself succeeded Arnold's tutor E. V. Gordon when Gordon left Leeds for Manchester) in teaching medieval English, Old Norse and modern Icelandic Studies. He became a senior lecturer in 1956 and retired in 1978 (when he was succeeded by Rory McTurk). From 1952-54 he was President of The Viking Society for Northern Research.

The band was founded in 1910 under the direction of C.W. Feuge, and is currently directed by Brian Gibbs. The band appears at Sam Houston football and basketball home games, as well as at pep rallies, the annual Battle of the Piney Woods in Houston, TX, and occasionally at in-state away games. History Early history (1910–19) The Sam Houston State Bearkat Marching Band has a record dating back to 1910. This unofficial university band consisted of just seven members, who were all males from multiple backgrounds, which included students, faculty, and Huntsville residents. Band director C. W. Feuge, a German instructor at the university, was approached by Henry C. Pritchett, president of the university, to start a brass band. After 7 years, the Sam Houston Band was officially organized in 1917. Before being made official, the band was open to anyone who had an instrument and was willing to participate, and more importantly, they were ineligible for any state funds. The new university president, Harry Estill, and Earl Huffor, the new band director and faculty manager, proved to the state legislature that states funds were needed to support the program. As a result, the marching band received six hundred dollars, which they used to purchase instruments and other supplies for the band. The first concert was performed in November 1917, and was considered successful enough to establish Huffor as the permanent band director until 1919. Following the spring semester of 1919 a new band director, W.R. Faifer, was appointed. Faifer had previously conducted a fifty-piece orchestra in Nacogdoches, Texas. Early meetings of the band were focused on music instruction until Faifer felt they were ready for public performance. Band development (1920–40) Over the next twenty years the band was directed under four different men: Faifer through the spring of 1920; W. R. Ford (1920–21); Erwin G. Ernst (1922–28); N. J. Whitehurst (1928-37); and C. R. Hackney (1937–40). The band's most successful years came in 1923-24. They performed at all home basketball games; all pep rallies, assemblies, and a memorial ceremony for Sam Houston at the Huntsville Community Fair on Armistice Day. In a program created by former Sam Houston alumni, the marching band performed in Fort Worth, Texas for a radio appearance. Following the performance, the band received complimentary letters from thirteen different states and Canada. The band made a return trip to Fort Worth the following semester to perform at the State Teachers Convention. At the basketball games, according to the campus newspaper, The Houstonian, they \\"made the gym vibrate and helped put fight into the team and spirit into the student body\\". In 1926, the band expanded to twenty-five members, which included both students and Huntsville residents. During that fall, the band made their first football appearance at the game against Abilene Christian, following which they were urged by The Houstonian to continue to appear at games. Through the next several years the band saw growth and made appearances not only at Sam Houston events, but at off-campus events as well, including county fairs and other community activities. Starting with the 1929–30 school year, the Bearkat Band played at all home football and basketball games. This was also the first year the band elected officers. By 1933, the band size had increased to thirty members. In 1937 Hackney was appointed as the new band director. President Shaver granted three thousand dollars to the band to purchase new instruments and new uniforms, and ordered all existing uniforms to be burned and all instruments scrapped. Beginning in the fall of 1939, the Sam Houston State School of Music was created, and with the increased enrollment for music the band saw a 100 percent increase in membership, bringing their total membership to eighty-four. Growth from 1940–1962 The fall of 1940 saw the membership rise to 110 members. Later that semester, the band performed in front of the Governor and State Legislature in Austin, Texas, giving a tribute to all state teacher colleges by playing their fight songs or alma maters. Starting with the 1941 football season, the band began regular halftime shows and performed at eight of ten games. 1942 saw lowered numbers regarding band size. The year started with sixty-five members, much lower when compared to the 110 members in the band just two years prior. By the end of the spring semester, only twenty-five members remained. The next year, Sam Houston's enrollment dwindled due to World War II to the point where there was no football team to perform for. At war's end, the band slowly began to increase in numbers, reaching eighty-five members by the 1949 school year. In 1953, a sorority for female band members was created, the Progressive Band Women's Association, and was open to any girl in the band maintaining a C average. The sorority later affiliated with a national group, becoming the Alpha Omicron chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. In 1954 the football team accepted an invitation to play in the Refrigerator Bowl in Indiana. No funds were available for the band to travel to the game, so the band members ran fundraisers and performed odd jobs to raise the funds while dressed as \\"hobos\\". The twenty-five hundred dollar goal was met. The Famous Bearkat Band name was used to describe and introduce the band as early as 1950, and by 1956 the name became a regular part of the band's introduction for football games. By 1960, the band had increased to over one hundred forty, resulting in the number of shows featuring the band increasing. For the first time in twenty-five years, the Christmas concert was performed in 1960. In the spring, the band performed at the first Texas Music Educators Association convention in Dallas, Texas. The 1961–62 school year saw the creation of an endowment fund for scholarships. Two awards of two-hundred and fifty dollars were offered in memory of Inez Powell. Band members auditioned for these scholarships at the end of the two semesters. In the spring of 1962, the band performed at the Sam Houston Ex- Students banquet at the Texas State Teachers Association Convention, and the Wind Ensemble performed in Bryan, Texas on KBTX-TV. Recent history Former band director Elliot T. Bowers later went on to become university president, and the football stadium is named in his honor. The band's peak was in the 1970s when the wind ensemble performed for the American Band Association and Japanese Band Association's joint convention held in Hawaii. During Sam Houston's 2011 National Championship run, many of the Bearkat band members were unable to perform due to the playoffs being held after the semester was over. To replace the missing members, former Bearkat Marching Band alumni were asked to perform during the FCS Semifinal game. This was the first ever Alumni Bearkat Marching Band. On-field performances In the early 1940s one popular halftime show was an American military tribute known as the \\"bomber formation\\", which included a blackout of the stadium, sirens, motors and fireworks to replicate a \\"bombing\\". As the performance closed, the band exited to \\"God Bless America. Today, the Bearkat Marching Band performs several different halftime shows throughout the football season. These shows include contemporary music and have specific themes. Some themes in recent years include a superhero show and a Blues Brothers show. Traditions Throughout its 100-year history, the band developed many traditions. These include the March to Bowers, and the performance of the Alma Mater from the stands in front of the entire football team. The March to Bowers began during the 2010 season. The band walks from the library on campus to Bearkat Alley at Bowers Stadium playing melodies. They are followed by the Orange Pride dance team and Sam Houston State cheerleaders. A ten-minute mini-pep rally precedes the March. Sam Houston State has many in-game traditions, most of which were started in the last decade, such as when both teams' bands are present, the Bearkat Marching Band drum line learns the other band's drum cadences and plays them back. Beginning with the 2011 football team's undefeated regular season, the Bearkat Marching Band plays DJ Khaled's hit song, All I Do Is Win after victories. Before the football team leaves the field, the band plays the SHSU alma mater in front of the entire football team. During the song, the fans, along with the football team, raise his or her right hand up over their head and curls the fingers down to form a paw. The football team sings the lyrics to the alma mater. Accolades In 1953, the National Bandmasters Association named The Bearkat Marching Band one of the Top Ten College Bands in the nation. Texas Governor Allen Shivers declared the band the official unit for the state on April 21 in the same year.

She was bred and owned by Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, for whom she produced five foals as a broodmare. Background Bridget was a bay filly bred by Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, and foaled in 1776. She was sired by Herod, who was a successful racehorse and important sire. He was champion sire eight times and his progeny included the undefeated Highflyer, Oaks winners Faith and Maid of the Oaks, St. Leger winner Phoenomenon and the triple Craven Stakes winner Woodpecker. Bridget was the first foal of Jemima, a daughter of Snap. Racing career Bridget made her first racecourse appearance on 14 May 1779 in the first running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs. After starting as the 5/2 favourite, she won the race, beating Fame, Lavinia and nine others. At Newmarket in July she won a Sweepstakes of 50 guineas each over the Rowley Mile, beating Fame, Torrent and one other. At Newmarket's First October meeting she started as the 1/2 favourite for a Sweepstakes of 100 guineas each over the two-mile Ditch In course. She won the race, beating four rivals, including Torrent and Transfer. At the Newmarket Craven meeting in 1780 Bridget beat Thunder to win the Post Stakes. In July she beat Whipcord to win half of the Grosvenor's Stakes, after the other half had been given to Imperator to withdraw from the race. Her only other race of 1780 was in October, when she beat Postboy in a match over the two middle miles of the Beacon Course at Newmarket. Bridget started once in 1781, winning a match against General Smith's Girandola. Stud career Bridget became a broodmare at the Earl of Derby's stud and produced five foals.

It is written in Middle Scots. As with the other tales in the collection, appended to it is a moralitas which elaborates on the moral that the fable is supposed to contain. The tale is an expansion of Aesop's Fable of The Frog and the Mouse and concerns a mouse that desires to cross a stream. A paddock offers his assistance and, to prove his trustworthiness, discusses the difference between appearing and being virtuous. As the two cross the stream tied together, the paddock betrays and tries to drown the mouse. Their struggle is seen by a kite (bird), who grabs and kills them both. Synopsis Tale A mouse is sat alongside a stream, lamenting being unable to cross it and reach the cereals and other foodstuffs on the opposite side. A paddock approaches and says that she will assist her in crossing; the mouse enquires as to how the creature is able to swim, and she explains how her anatomy allows her to. However, the mouse suspects, on the basis of physiognomy, that the paddock is untrustworthy; she highlights her features, and recites the proverb that a man's morals is shown in his face. To this the paddock replies with another proverb, do not judge a man by his looks, and gives several instances in which goodness in appearance is not replicated in spirit. Finally, the mouse accedes to the help, although is still concerned about a potential loss of liberty and life which will accompany being tied to the paddock as they cross the water; she makes the paddock swear an oath that she will assist her in crossing. The two tie themselves together with some string and proceed to swim. However, as they start across the stream the paddock swims downwards with the intention of drowning the mouse; the mouse decries the creature's deception, but struggles upwards to prevent herself from drowning. Seeing the struggle is a nearby kite. The bird flies down and grabs the two—as they are bound together—and carries them away, where he kills and disembowels them, though they do not satiate his appetite much.

Eq(1) has only one metric function \\\\Psi(\\\\rho,\\\\phi,z) to be identified, and for each concrete \\\\Psi(\\\\rho,\\\\phi,z), Eq(1) would yields a specific conformastatic spacetime.  Reduced electrovac field equations  In consistency with the conformastatic geometry Eq(1), the electrostatic field would arise from an electrostatic potential A_a without spatial symmetry: (3)\\\\qquad A_a = \\\\Phi(\\\\rho,z,\\\\phi) [dt]_a\\\\;, which would yield the electromagnetic field tensor F_{ab} by (4)\\\\qquad F_{ab} = A_{b\\\\,;a}-A_{a\\\\,;b}\\\\;, as well as the corresponding stress–energy tensor by (5)\\\\qquad T_{ab}^{(EM)} = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\Big(F_{ac}F_b^{\\\\;\\\\;c}-\\\\frac{1}{4}g_{ab}F_{cd}F^{cd} \\\\Big)\\\\;. Plug Eq(1) and Eqs(3)(4)(5) into \\"trace-free\\" (R=0) Einstein's field equation, and one could obtain the reduced field equations for the metric function \\\\Psi(\\\\rho,\\\\phi,z): (6)\\\\qquad abla^2\\\\Psi \\\\,=\\\\,e^{- 2 \\\\Psi} \\\\, abla\\\\Phi\\\\, abla\\\\Phi (7)\\\\qquad \\\\Psi_i \\\\Psi_j = e^{-2 \\\\Psi} \\\\Phi_i \\\\Phi_j where abla^2 = \\\\partial_{\\\\rho\\\\rho}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\,\\\\partial_\\\\rho +\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho^2}\\\\partial_{\\\\phi\\\\phi}+\\\\partial_{zz} and abla=\\\\partial_\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\hat{e}_\\\\rho +\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\partial_\\\\phi\\\\, \\\\hat{e}_\\\\phi +\\\\partial_z\\\\, \\\\hat{e}_z are respectively the generic Laplace and gradient operators. in Eq(7), i\\\\,,j run freely over the coordinates [\\\\rho, z, \\\\phi].  Linearization of electrovac field equations   Examples   Extremal Reissner–Nordström spacetime  The extremal Reissner–Nordström spacetime is a typical conformastatic solution. In this case, the metric function is identified as (8)\\\\qquad \\\\Psi_{ERN}\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\ln\\\\frac{L}{L+M}\\\\;,\\\\quad L=\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho^2+z^2}\\\\;, which put Eq(1) into the concrete form (9)\\\\qquad ds^2=-\\\\frac{L^2}{(L+M)^2}dt^2+\\\\frac{(L+M)^2}{L^2}\\\\,\\\\big(d\\\\rho^2+dz^2+\\\\rho^2d\\\\varphi^2\\\\big)\\\\;. Applying the transformations (10)\\\\;\\\\;\\\\quad L=r-M\\\\;,\\\\quad z=(r-M)\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\;,\\\\quad \\\\rho=(r-M)\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\;, one obtains the usual form of the line element of extremal Reissner–Nordström solution, (11)\\\\;\\\\;\\\\quad ds^2=-\\\\Big(1-\\\\frac{M}{r}\\\\Big)^2 dt^2+\\\\Big(1-\\\\frac{M}{r}\\\\Big)^{-2} dr^2+r^2 \\\\Big(d\\\\theta^2+\\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\phi^2\\\\Big)\\\\;.  Charged dust disks  Some conformastatic solutions have been adopted to describe charged dust disks.  Comparison with Weyl spacetimes  Many solutions, such as the extremal Reissner–Nordström solution discussed above, can be treated as either a conformastatic metric or Weyl metric, so it would be helpful to make a comparison between them. The Weyl spacetimes refer to the static, axisymmetric class of solutions to Einstein's equation, whose line element takes the following form (still in Weyl's canonical coordinates): (12)\\\\;\\\\;\\\\quad ds^2=-e^{2\\\\psi(\\\\rho,z)}dt^2+e^{2\\\\gamma(\\\\rho,z)-2\\\\psi(\\\\rho,z)}(d\\\\rho^2+dz^2)+e^{-2\\\\psi(\\\\rho,z)}\\\\rho^2 d\\\\phi^2\\\\,. Hence, a Weyl solution become conformastatic if the metric function \\\\gamma(\\\\rho,z) vanishes, and the other metric function \\\\psi(\\\\rho,z) drops the axial symmetry: (13)\\\\;\\\\;\\\\quad \\\\gamma(\\\\rho,z)\\\\equiv 0\\\\;, \\\\quad \\\\psi(\\\\rho,z)\\\\mapsto \\\\Psi(\\\\rho,\\\\phi,z) \\\\,. The Weyl electrovac field equations would reduce to the following ones with \\\\gamma(\\\\rho,z): (14.a)\\\\quad abla^2 \\\\psi =\\\\,( abla\\\\psi)^2 (14.b)\\\\quad abla^2\\\\psi =\\\\,e^{-2\\\\psi} ( abla\\\\Phi)^2 (14.c)\\\\quad \\\\psi^2_{,\\\\,\\\\rho}-\\\\psi^2_{,\\\\,z}=e^{-2\\\\psi}\\\\big(\\\\Phi^2_{,\\\\,\\\\rho}-\\\\Phi^2_{,\\\\,z}\\\\big) (14.d)\\\\quad 2\\\\psi_{,\\\\,\\\\rho}\\\\psi_{,\\\\,z}= 2e^{-2\\\\psi}\\\\Phi_{,\\\\,\\\\rho}\\\\Phi_{,\\\\,z} (14.e)\\\\quad abla^2\\\\Phi =\\\\,2 abla\\\\psi abla\\\\Phi\\\\,, where abla^2 = \\\\partial_{\\\\rho\\\\rho}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\,\\\\partial_\\\\rho +\\\\partial_{zz} and abla=\\\\partial_\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\hat{e}_\\\\rho +\\\\partial_z\\\\, \\\\hat{e}_z are respectively the reduced cylindrically symmetric Laplace and gradient operators.

He is best known today as the instigator of the BMW Art Car Project. Poulain's idea was to invite artists to use new automobiles as their canvas. In 1975, Poulain commissioned American artist and friend Alexander Calder to paint the first BMW Art Car. This first example would be a BMW 3.0 CSL 'Batmobile' which Poulain himself would race in the 1975 Le Mans endurance race.[1] Poulain drove Calder's BMW with Jean Guichet and Sam Posey, although the car suffered driveshaft issues and was retired early, and never raced again. Calder died a year later, in 1976; the BMW was his last work. Andy Warhol's version of the BMW M1 was more successful at Le Mans, with Poulain, Winkelhock and Mignot behind the wheel. They completed 288 laps at the Sarthe circuit, coming in 6th overall, and 2nd in their class. During the course of that race the car made contact with other cars several times; Andy Warhol had painted spare bumpers and body panels, which were necessary! Poulain also drove the Roy Lichenstein's Art Car - a Group 5 BMW 320i, which finished first in its class, and was the most successful Art Car of all in competition.

Widely considered to be the group's best-known artist, Kilbourn used the experiences that he had gained while working in the mines and represented them in his art work. His main contribution to the Ashington Group was his focus on Modern art.  Early life and family  Kilbourn was born in 75 Chestnut Street, Ashington, and was the fifth child of James Smith Kilbourn and Mary Hannah Chilton. After attending elementary school, he began working as a miner at the Duke pit, Ashington, three days after his thirteenth birthday. When Kilbourn was eleven, his father had an accident in the pit and damaged his back. He never worked again. Kilbourn was to become the \\"breadwinner more or less, maintaining the whole family on fourteen shillings a week till [his] sisters got jobs.\\"  Coal mining  Kilbourn worked at the Duke pit for eleven years until its closure. William Feaver writes that after the Duke pit closed, \\"Kilbourn moved to the nearby Ellington collier, where he became a coalface drawer aged twenty-four. He remained at Ellington for the rest of his working life, becoming a salvage drawer during the Second World War and a wasteman, responsible for the maintenance of the mine's airways.\\" Kilbourn retired from mining in 1968.  Artwork  Starting around the mid-1920s, Kilbourn \\"attended tutorial class organized by the Ashington Miners' Union and then the WEA and it was through this route that he enrolled on Robert Lyon's art appreciation course in October 1934.\\" In the course, the Ashington Group focused on the history of art as well as their own setting and way of life: coal. While drawing heavily from the conditions of the coal mines and the coal miner's lifestyle, Kilbourn produced art work that reflected his experiences. Seven years after attending an exhibition in Durham, Kilbourn considered creating a visual memoir of his experiences, \\"starting as a pom-pom boy on the compressed air coal-cutting machines in 1917, going on to be a putter-lad, a coal face drawer, a salvage drawer and a wasteman.\\" During development of his project, \\"the memories were directed into detailed narrative.\\" 'My Life as a Pitman' became an exhibition in 1977 and was considered as a \\"North Country counterpart to the colourful rural Chinese scenes.\\"  Writing  Aside from producing art, the Ashington Group maintained a publication called The Ashington Collieries Magazine. The October 1937 issue features Kilbourn's \\"An Approach To Modern Art\\".  \\"An Approach To Modern Art\\"  Kilbourn's article consists of a brief history of 14th & 15th century, Dutch school, French as well as Impressionist art and their relationship with the use of color, shading, and what they aimed to depict. His praise for each movement of art establishes his appreciation for the art that has given us \\"pictures skillfully executed and full of a wealth of ornament.\\" Kilbourn credits French painter Cézanne with \\"opening new avenues of experience to the artistic sense\\" and giving a \\"fuller meaning of artistic expression.\\" But, Kilbourn writes that, As seen in Kilbourn's work, modern art can reflect the conditions that artists experience. When judging modern art, Kilbourn says that one must disregard the standards set by the \\"early masters,\\" and judge it \\"in the same way that we do applied modern artistic expression, such as fashion in dress or furnishing in the home.\\" The main difference between the works of the \\"early masters\\" and modern artists is that \\"modern work is more simple and more direct.\\" Kilbourn concludes, \\"But, I wonder, do we judge the modern picture as sympathetically as we should do?\\" Above all, Kilbourn is saying that as civilisation became more complex, art became more complex. Art can be simple and still be art, but must be judged through an \\"applied modern artistic expression,\\" because new conditions can influence art.  Personal life  Oliver Kilbourn was married to Margaret Isabel (Peggy; 1914–2006) on 20 November 1952.

Hypnosis in sports has therapeutic and performance-enhancing functions. The mental state of athletes during training and competition is said to impact performance. Hypnosis is a form of mental training and can therefore contribute to enhancing athletic execution. Sports hypnosis is used by athletes, coaches and psychologists. History Hypnosis has been used in various professions including dentistry, medicine, psychotherapy and sports, as a performance enhancement tool. Sports hypnosis incorporates cognitive and sports science methodologies. Hypnosis in sports therefore overlaps with areas such as biomechanics, nutrition, physiology and sports psychology. Generally sports hypnosis is studied within the field of sports psychology, which examines the impact of psychological variables on athletes' performance. While sports psychology began to be studied around the 1920s, the study and use of hypnosis was not documented until the 1950s. Members of the Russian Olympic team are said to have made use of hypnosis as a performance-enhancing tool around this time. Application Although not referred to as hypnosis, professional athletes and teams have used an approach called guided imagery, which is much similar to techniques used in sports hypnosis. Hypnosis is one of several techniques that athletes may employ to accomplish their sporting goals and it is equally beneficial to coaches as well as athletes. Hypnosis may do for the mind what physical activity does for the body of an athlete. The theory behind sports hypnosis is that relaxation is key to improved sporting performance and athletes may perform better if they are able to relax mentally and focus on the task at hand. Hypnosis may help athletes attain relaxation during practise and competition. Hypnosis may also help to control anxiety and manage stress in athletes. Athletes may develop auto-response to preestablished stimuli which is geared towards achieving optimal performance levels. Sports Hypnosis can also eliminate phobic responses, such as 'Trigger Freeze' in the Clay Pigeon Shooter, 'Target Panic' in the Archer and Fears of further injury in sports people following injury. The impact of hypnosis on various aspects of sporting performance has been studied. Research has studied the role of hypnosis in enhancing basketball skills, on flow-state and golf-putting performance, its impact on long-distance runners, on archery performance and on flow states and short- serve in badminton. The use of hypnosis in sports offers the following potential benefits that may help athletes handle personal challenges that would otherwise negatively affect sporting performance.

USDA, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Shrub Sciences Laboratory. This plant is quite variable, with certain characters defining each of its many varieties. In general, it is a shrub producing several upright stems reaching 10 centimeters to one meter tall, but usually not reaching that height. The branches are coated in a fuzz of white or greenish fibers. The leaves are linear to spatula-shaped and measure one to 8 centimeters long. The leaves are hairless to quite hairy or woolly in texture, and they may be glandular and sticky. The inflorescence is often a mass of many flower heads, but sometimes the heads are solitary. Each head has up to 20 yellow disc florets. There are no ray florets. The fruit is an achene up to 8 millimeters long tipped with a whitish or brown pappus up to 7.5 millimeters in length. Flowering occurs mostly in July through September, and the achenes develop and disperse in the fall and into the winter. The seed is wind-dispersed. The plant's lifespan is 15 to 20 years. This hardy plant occupies several habitat types. It can be found in mountains and foothills and its population will often increase upon environmental disturbance, such as grazing.

The bungalow court was created in Pasadena, California in 1909 and was the predominant form of multi-family housing in Southern California from the 1910s through the 1930s. Homes in bungalow courts were generally small, low-rise houses in the spirit of bungalow design; however, the homes were designed in a variety of architectural styles, including Swiss chalet and Spanish Colonial Revival. Bungalow courts also integrated their courtyards with the homes, providing green space to homeowners. Bungalow courts were generally marketed at people who wanted the amenities of a single-family home without its high cost. While each family in a bungalow court had its own house and garden, upkeep and land were shared among the residents. Bungalow courts were especially popular in Pasadena, the city of their origin. The courts' design prompted the Pasadena City Council to pass regulations requiring all multi-family housing in the city to be centered on a landscaped courtyard. In addition, of the 112 surviving bungalow courts in Pasadena, 43 have a historic designation such as a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The city is attempting to list the remaining eligible courts due to the design's role in Pasadena history.

It was designed by Paul J. Pelz, the architect of the Library of Congress, in the Northern Renaissance style, and built in 1900-01 for Commander Frederick Augustus Miller (1842–1909). Because Miller had been a U.S. Navy officer during the U.S. Civil War the house includes a number of maritime motifs, including the statue of a ship's cat on the ledge facing Massachusetts Avenue. The house was sold by Miller's widow in 1913 and changed hands several times afterwards. During most of the 1920s it was owned by Washington developer Harry Wardman or his business partners. In 1923–26 it was leased to the Costa Rican and Salvadorean Legations. Like many mansions in Northwest Washington, D.C., it was then divided into apartments during the Great Depression and rented as a boarding house. In the early 1960s it was owned by Oscar Sydney Cox, who in 1940–41 had been instrumental in drafting and administering the Lend-Lease Act. In 1984 the building was renovated by its then-owner, Scott McLeod. The renovation was completed in 1986, in spite of a fire which destroyed many of the house's internal features. It was conducted by Richard Ridley, a local architect and author of the Washington Posts Making Space column from 1982 to 1988, and won a Dupont Circle Conservancy Historic Preservation Award. An integral part of the house is the former garage on 22nd Street, also built in 1900–01 and one of the first such constructions designed specifically to store an automobile (actually, an electric car) rather than a horse carriage. From 1986 to 2009 it was used by Olga Hirshhorn, widow of entrepreneur and philanthropist Joseph Hirshhorn, to host part of her art collection. Hirschhorn named the 500-square-foot structure her \\"Mouse House\\", in playful reference to the house's cat statue. In 2009 the contents of the \\"Mouse House\\" were displayed at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Connecticut and then at the Patty & Jay Baker Museum of Art in Naples, Florida where they have since been donated to the permanent exhibition.

They were defined by linguistic anthropologist Charles F. Hockett in the 1960s. He called these characteristics the design features of language. Hockett originally believed there to be 13 design features. While primate communication utilizes the first 9 features, the final 4 features (displacement, productivity, cultural transmission, and duality) are reserved for humans. Hockett later added prevarication, reflexiveness, and learnability to the list as uniquely human characteristics. He asserted that even the most basic human languages possess these 16 features.  Charles Hockett  Charles Hockett was an American linguist and anthropologist, who lived from 1916 to 2000. Hockett graduated from Yale in 1939, and later taught at both Cornell and Rice. Hockett made significant contributions to structural linguistics, as well as the study of Native American, Chinese, and Fijian languages. His work focused mainly on detailed linguistic analysis, particularly morphology and phonology, and on the concepts and tools that facilitated such analysis.Kemmer, Suzanne. Biographical sketch of Charles Hockett. 23 February 2008. Retrieved 12 May 2013 from http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Found/hockettbio Up until the 1950s, language was largely viewed as a social-behavioral phenomenon. Hockett was challenged in this belief by Noam Chomsky, who suggested that language is biologically-based and innately learned. Chomsky believed that humans share a universal grammar that ties all languages together. Hockett staunchly opposed this \\"Chomskyan\\" concept of the nature of language. However, Hockett is most famous for defining what he called the design features of language, which demonstrated his beliefs about the commonalities between human languages.Fox, Margalit. \\"Charles Hockett, 84, Linguist With an Anthropological View,\\" The New York Times. 13 November 2000. Retrieved 12 May 2013 from https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/13/arts/charles-hockett-84-linguist-with-an- anthropological-view.html  Design features of language  Vocal-auditory channel. Refers to the idea that speaking/hearing is the mode humans use for language. When Hockett first defined this feature, it did not take sign language into account, which reflects the ideology of orality that was prevalent during the time (See, for instance, the argumentation of Anne-Marie Christin, 1995). This feature has since been modified to include other channels of language, such as tactile-visual or chemical-olfactory. Broadcast transmission and directional reception When humans speak, sounds are transmitted in all directions; however, listeners perceive the direction from which the sounds are coming. Similarly, signers broadcast to potentially anyone within the line of sight, while those watching see who is signing. This is characteristic of most forms of human and animal communication. Transitoriness Also called rapid fading, transitoriness refers to the idea of temporary quality of language. Language sounds exist for only a brief period of time, after which they are no longer perceived. Sound waves quickly disappear once a speaker stops speaking. This is also true of signs. In contrast, other forms of communication such as writing and Inka khipus (knot- tying) are more permanent. thumb Interchangeability Refers to the idea that humans can give and receive identical linguistic signals; humans are not limited in the types of messages they can say/hear. One can say \\"I am a boy\\" even if one is a girl. This is not to be confused with lying (prevarication). The importance is that a speaker can physically create any and all messages regardless of their truth or relation to the speaker. In other words, anything that one can hear, one can also say. Not all species possess this feature. For example, in order to communicate their status, queen ants produce chemical scents that no other ants can produce (see animal communication below). Total feedback Speakers of a language can hear their own speech and can control and modify what they are saying as they say it. Similarly, signers see, feel, and control their signing. Specialization The purpose of linguistic signals is communication and not some other biological function. When humans speak or sign, it is generally intentional. An example of non-specialized communication is dog panting. When a dog pants, it often communicates to its owner that it is hot or thirsty; however, the dog pants in order to cool itself off. This is a biological function, and the communication is a secondary matter. Semanticity Specific sound signals are directly tied to certain meanings. Arbitrariness ** languages are generally made up of both arbitrary and iconic symbols. In spoken languages iconicity takes the form of onomatopoeia (e.g., in English \\"murmur\\", in Mandarin \\"māo\\" (cat), in ASL \\"cup\\", \\"me\\" \\"up/down\\", etc). For the very vast majority of other symbols, there is no intrinsic or logical connection between a sound form (signal) and what it refers to. Almost all names a human language attributes an object is thus arbitrary: the word \\"car\\" is nothing like an actual car. Spoken words are really nothing like the objects they represent. This is further demonstrated by the fact that different languages attribute very different names to the same object. Signed languages are transmitted visually and this allows for a certain degree of iconicity. For example, in the ASL sign HOUSE, the hands are flat and touch in a way that resembles the roof and walls of a house.Dr. William Vicars. **This sign can be non-iconic if said house is not shaped like that. Depicting Verbs (formerly thought to be classifiers and often still are by people who are not up on linguistics) are meant to modify (give more information about) the actual visual appearance or process. E.g. The sign used for the generic idea of \\"box\\" is different from the one used for \\"PO box\\" because the latter has specific shapes that often do not conform to other items sharing this label. The sign and depicting verb for \\"tree\\" does not encompass bamboo trees for example.** American Sign Language University. (n.d.) Retrieved 12 May 2013 from http://lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/h/house.htm However, many other signs are not iconic, and the relationship between form and meaning is arbitrary. Thus, while Hockett did not account for the possibility of non- arbitrary form-meaning relationships, the principle still generally applies. Discreteness Linguistic representations can be broken down into small discrete units which combine with each other in rule-governed ways. They are perceived categorically, not continuously. For example, English marks number with the plural morpheme /s/, which can be added to the end of any noun. The plural morpheme is perceived categorically, not continuously: we cannot express smaller or larger quantities by varying how loudly we pronounce the /s/. Displacement Refers to the idea that humans can talk about things that are not physically present or that do not even exist. Speakers can talk about the past and the future, and can express hopes and dreams. A human's speech is not limited to here and now. Displacement is one of the features that separates human language from other forms of primate communication. Productivity Refers to the idea that language-users can create and understand novel utterances. Humans are able to produce an unlimited amount of utterances. Also related to productivity is the concept of grammatical patterning, which facilitates the use and comprehension of language. Language is not stagnant, but is constantly changing. New idioms are created all the time and the meaning of signals can vary depending on the context and situation. Traditional transmission Also known as cultural transmission. Traditional transmission is the idea that while humans are born with innate language capabilities, language is more learned after birth through a social setting. It differs critically from Chomsky's idea of Universal Grammar and rather purports the concept that people learn how to speak by interacting with experienced language users. Significantly, language and culture are woven together in this construct, functioning as a hand in hand concept for language acquisition. Duality of patterning Meaningful messages are made up of distinct smaller meaningful units (words and morphemes) which themselves are made up of distinct smaller, meaningless units (phonemes). Prevarication Prevarication is the ability to lie or deceive. When using language, humans can make false or meaningless statements. This is an important distinction made of human communication ie. language as compared to animal communication. While animal communication can display a few other design features as proposed by Hockett but what animal communication is unable to do is lie or make up something that does not exist or have referent. Reflexiveness Humans can use language to talk about language. Also a very defining feature of human language, reflexiveness is a trait not shared by animal communication. Inherently with reflexiveness, it means that humans can describe what is language, talk about the structure of language, discuss about the idea of language among others using language. Learnability Language is teachable and learnable. In the same way as a speaker learns their first language, the speaker is able to learn other languages. It is worth noting that young children learn language with competence and ease; however, language acquisition is constrained by a critical period such that it becomes more difficult once children pass a certain age.  Design features in animal communication  Hockett distinguished language from communication. While almost all animals communicate in some way, a communication system is only considered language if it possesses all of the above characteristics. Some animal communication systems are impressively sophisticated in the sense that they possess a significant number of the design features as proposed by Hockett.  Ants  Ants make use of the chemical-olfactory channel of communication. Ants produce chemicals called pheromones, which are released through body glands and received by the tips of the antenna. Ants can produce up to twenty different pheromone scents, each a unique signal used to communicate things such as the location of food and danger, or even the need to defend or relocate the colony. When an ant is killed, it releases a pheromone that alerts others of potential danger. Pheromones also help ants distinguish family members from strangers. The queen ant has special pheromones which she uses to signal her status, orchestrate work, and let the colony know when they need to raise princesses or drones.Chemical pheromone communication between ants. antARK, 2010. Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://www.antark.net/ant-life/ant-communication/pheromones.html Ants will even engage in warfare to protect the colony or a food source. This warfare involves tactics that resemble human warfare. Marauder ants will capture and hold down an enemy while another ant crushes it. Ants are loyal to their colony to the death; however, the queen will kill her own in order to be the last one standing. This level of \\"planning\\" among an animal species requires an intricate communication.Moffett, Mark W. Battles among ants resemble human warfare, Scientific American. 8 January 2012. Retrieved 13 May 2013 from http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ants-and-the-art-of-war  Birds  Bird communication demonstrates many features, including the vocal- auditory channel, broadcast transmission/directional reception, rapid fading, semanticity, and arbitrariness. Bird communication is divided into songs and calls. Songs are used primarily to attract mates, while calls are used to alert of food and danger and coordinate movement with the flock. Calls are acoustically simple, while songs are longer and more complex.Duhamel, D. (October 2009). Retrieved from http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdcommunication.html Bird communication is both discrete and non-discrete. Birds use syntax to arrange their songs, where musical notes act as phonemes. The order of the notes is important to the meaning of the song, thus indicating that discreteness exists. Bird communication is also continuous in the sense that it utilizes duration and frequency. However, the fact that birds have \\"phonemes\\" does not necessarily mean that they can combine them in an infinite way. Birds have a limited number of songs that they can produce. The male indigo bunting only has one song, while the brown thrasher can sing over 2000 songs.All About Birds: Vocal Development. Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. (n.d.) Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/studying/birdsongs/vocaldev Birds even have unique dialects, depending on where they are from.CJ Kazilek, David Pearson and Pierre Deviche. \\"Birds and their songs\\", Ask a Biologist. Arizona State University. (n.d) Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/birds-and-their-songs  Honeybees  Honeybee communication is distinct from other forms of animal communication. Rather than vocal-auditory, bees use the space-movement channel to communicate. Honeybees use dances to communicate—the round dance, the waggle dance, as well as the transitional dance. Depending on the species, the round dance is used to communicate that food is 20–30 meters from the hive, the waggle dance is used for food that is 40–90 meters from the hive, and the transitional dance is used for the distances in between. To do the waggle dance, a bee moves in a zig-zag line and then does a loop back to the beginning of the line, forming a figure-eight. The direction of the line points to the food. The speed of the dance indicates the distance to the food. In this way, bee dancing is also continuous, rather than discrete. Their communication is also not arbitrary. They move in a direction and pattern that physically points out where food is located. Honeybee dancing also demonstrates displacement, which is generally considered a human characteristic. Most animals will only give a food-found call in the physical presence of food, yet bees can talk about food that is over 100 meters away.  Footnotes   References  * Christin, A.-M.

Russian formalism (1910s–1930s)  Yury Tynyanov was a Russian writer and literary critic. Boris Eichenbaum outlined principles of syntagmatic construction. Syntagmatic analysis deals with sequence and structure, as opposed to the paradigm emphasis of paradigmatic analysis. The cinema, for Eichenbaum, is a “particular of figurative language,” the stylistics of which would treat filmic “syntax,” the linkage of shots in “phrases” and “sentences.” Russian formalists Eichenbaum and Tynyanov had two different approaches to interpreting the signs of film. \\"Tynyanov spoke of the cinema as offering the visible world in the form of semantic signs engendered by cinematic procedures such as lighting and montage, while Eichenbaum saw film in relation to \\"inner speech\\" and \\"image translations of linguistic tropes.\\"\\"  Structuralism and post-structuralism (1950s–present)  The film-language concept was explored more deeply in the 1960s when post- structuralist thinkers started to criticize structuralism. Also, semiotics became popular in academia. Early work in this field dealt with “contrasting arbitrary signs of natural language with the motivated, iconic signs of the cinema”. * Umberto Eco – Italian novelist and semiotician * Pier Paolo Pasolini – Italian director and writer * Christian Metz – French film theorist * Roland Barthes – French literary theorist  Concepts  Denotation and connotation Film communicates meaning denotatively and connotatively. What the audience sees and hears is denotative, it is what it is and they do not have to strive to recognize it. At the same time these sounds and images are connotative and the way the scene is shot is meant to evoke certain feelings from the viewer. Connotation typically involves emotional overtones, objective interpretation, social values, and ideological assumptions. According to Christian Metz, “The study of connotation brings us closer to the notion of the cinema as an art (the “seventh art”).” Within connotations, paradigmatic connotations exist, which would be a shot that is being compared with its unrealized companions in the paradigm. A low angle shot of a rose conveys a sense that the flower is somehow dominant or overpowering because we unconsciously compare it with an overhead shot of a rose which would diminish its importance. Syntagmatic connotation would not compare the rose shot to other potential shots but compare it with actual shots that precede or follow it. The meaning adheres to it because its compared to other shots we actually see. Narrative Narrative is generally known as having two components; the story presented and the process of telling it, or narration, often referred to as narrative discourse. Film narrative theory seeks to uncover the apparently “motivated” and “natural” relationship between the signifier and the story- world in order to reveal the deeper system of cultural associations and relationships that are expressed through narrative form. As Roland Barthes has said, “narrative may be transmitted through oral or written language; through static or moving images, through gestures and through an organized mixture of all these substances. There is narrative in myth, legend, fables, fairytales, novellas, novels, history, novel, epos, tragedy, drama, comedy, pantomime, pictures, comics, events and conversation. In these unlimited forms, narrative exists at all times, in all corners of the earth, in all societies. Narrative begins with the history of mankind.” Films use a combination of dialog, sounds, visual images, gestures and actions to create the narrative. Narrators, usually in a voice-over format, are very popular in documentary film and greatly assist in telling the story while accompanying powerful shots. Tropes Metonymy refers to the ability of a sign to represent something entirely, while literally only being a part of it. An example of this is the Eiffel Tower, which is a metonym for Paris. Film uses metonyms frequently because they rely on the external to reveal the internal. Another powerful semiotic tool for filmmaking is the use of metaphors, which are defined as a comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. In film, a pair of consecutive shots is metaphorical when there is an implied comparison of the two shots. For instance, a shot of an airplane followed by a shot of a bird flying would be metaphorical, implying that the airplane is (or is like) a bird.  Notable works  Umberto Eco (1968) Umberto Eco, \\"Articulations of The Cinematic Code\\" (1976)—\\"Sulle articolazioni del codice cinematografico\\" (1968): Umberto Eco’s research dealt with the semiology of visual codes using the work of Metz and Pier Paolo Pasolini as a starting point. Film semiotics was born in a series of memorable debates among Eco, Metz and Pasolini at the Mostra Internazionale del Nuovo Cinema in Pesaro from 1965 to 1967.Ipersignificato: Umberto Eco and Film Eco viewed the task of semiology as important and radical. “Semiology shows us the universe of ideologies, arranged in codes and sub-codes, within the universe of signs, and these ideologies are reflected in our preconstituted ways of using the language.” Triple articulation codes consist of figures, signs and elements. Eco assumed that the cinematic codes are the only ones using triple articulation. Where current linguistic conventions might use two axes, the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic, the triple articulation can use kinesics to identify discrete units of time.Eco, U. (January 1970). \\"Articulations of the Cinematic Code\\". Cinemantics 1(1), 590–605. Articulations are introduced into a code to communicate the maximum number of combinable elements. Because we normally experience non-articulated and double-articulated codes, running across a code with triple articulation can be overwhelming. “The contextual wealth of this combination makes the cinema a richer form of communication than speech.” Summary of codes 1\\\\.

This movement culminated in women's suffrage in 1919. Later waves of feminist activists pushed to expand women's rights. History Medieval period to Early Modern era Feminism in Germany has its earliest roots in the lives of women who challenged conventional gender roles as early as the Medieval period. From the early Medieval period and continuing through to the 18th century, Germanic law assigned women to a subordinate and dependent position relative to men. Salic (Frankish) law, from which the laws of the German lands would be based, placed women at a disadvantage with regard to property and inheritance rights. Germanic widows required a male guardian to represent them in court. Unlike Anglo-Saxon law or the Visigothic Code, Salic law barred women from royal succession. Social status was based on military and biological roles, a reality demonstrated in rituals associated with newborns, when female infants were given a lesser value than male infants. The use of physical force against wives was condoned until the 18th century in Bavarian law. Some women of means asserted their influence during the Middle Ages, typically in royal court or convent settings. Hildegard of Bingen, Gertrude the Great, Elisabeth of Bavaria (1478–1504), and Argula von Grumbach are among the women who pursued independent accomplishments in fields as diverse as medicine, music composition, religious writing, and government and military politics. Enlightenment and early 19th century Legal recognition of women's rights in Germany came more slowly than in some other countries, such as England, France, the United States, or Canada. The equal rights of parents under German law did not arrive until the German Federal Republic in the 20th century; the German Civil Code introduced in 1900 had left the law unaltered in the matter, basing it precisely on the General state laws for the Prussian states of 1794. Property rights were also slow to change. During the late 19th century, married women still had no property rights, requiring a male guardian to administer property on their behalf (exceptions were made for cases involving imprisoned or absent husbands). Any woman who had inherited an artisan business had some freedom in practice to run the business, but she was not permitted to attend guild meetings, and had to send a male to represent her interests. Tradition dictated that \\"the state recognizes a burgher but not a burgess\\". The Age of Enlightenment brought a consciousness of feminist thinking to England and France, most influentially in the works of Mary Wollstonecraft. This was a development that lagged in German-speaking regions. Where upper-class women were literate in England and France and sometimes became prolific writers of feminist works, a network of feminist writers and activists was slow to emerge in what would become modern Germany. Many reasons have been considered as having a bearing upon this dilemma, from fractured regions, to the lack of a capital city, to the slow spread of novels and other literary forms in German-speaking areas. Women with literary talent were more likely to work in relative isolation, yet they left a legacy of letters and memoirs that gained a new popularity as the nostalgic Kulturgeschichte (culture history) trend in the first decades of the 20th century. Feminist ideas still began to spread, and some radical women became outspoken in promoting the cause of women's rights. Sophie Mereau launched the Almanach für Frauen (Women's Almanac) in 1784. Feminism as a movement began to gain ground toward the end of the 19th century, although it did not yet include a strong push to extend suffrage to German women. Some women who worked for women's rights were in fact opposed to extending the vote to women, a stance that became more widespread at the turn of the 20th century, when many Germans were concerned that granting women the vote would result in more votes for socialists.

File:Mereau.jpgSophie Mereau, Age of Enlightenment writer. Wilhelmine Germany Germany's unification process after 1871 was heavily dominated by men and gave priority to the \\"Fatherland\\" theme and related male issues, such as military prowess.Brigitte Young, Triumph of the fatherland: German unification and the marginalization of women (1999). Nevertheless, women became much better organized themselves. Middle class women enrolled in the Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine, the Union of German Feminist Organizations (BDF). Founded in 1894, it grew to include 137 separate women's rights groups from 1907 until 1933, when the Nazi regime disbanded the organization. The BDF gave national direction to the proliferating women's organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists. Formal organizations for promoting women's rights grew in numbers during the Wilhelmine period. German feminists began to network with feminists from other countries, and participated in the growth of international organizations; Marie Stritt was active as a feminist leader not only in Germany but with the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA). Stritt met the radical feminists Anita Augspurg (Germany's first woman university graduate) and Minna Cauer, and became a supporter of the Women's Legal Aid Society. Stritt's goals included suffrage for women, access to higher education, an end to state-regulated prostitution, free access to contraception and abortion, and reforms to divorce laws. Stritt was active as a member and leader in many German feminist organizations during the late 19th century and early 20th century, including: * League for the Protection of Motherhood and Social Reform * Reform * Federation of German Women's Associations (FGWA) The FGWA had been moderate in its positions until 1902, then launched a campaign to reform the civil code, but the campaign failed to bring about any changes. Stritt found herself on the radical edge of Germany's feminist movement, spearheading the German Association for Women's Suffrage from 1911 until it disbanded in 1919, having achieved the goal of women's suffrage in November of that year.

File:Clara Zetkin Denkmal Dresden.jpgA bust of Clara Zetkin in Dresden, Germany. Zetkin was a member of the Reichstag, and co-founded International Women's Day. Socialist feminists were active in promoting the rights of working-class women. Socialist, communist, and social democratic organizations had feminist members, who promoted women's rights with mixed success. During the rise of nationalism in this era, one Fascist organization that was vocally anti- feminist was the German National Association of Commercial Employees (Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfenverband, or DHV), which promoted the interests of the merchant class. There was little opportunity for feminists of the working class and feminists of the middle or upper classes to work together. The expansion of Germany's industrial economy during the 1890s and up to World War I had brought more women into the labour force. However, cooperation between the social classes was \\"unfeasible\\" at the time. Women's emancipation was attained despite pressure from The German League for the Prevention of Women's Emancipation, which numbered several hundred supporters and was active beginning in 1912, disbanding in 1920. The antifeminist sentiment among some Germans reflected a variety of arguments against women's emancipation: Writer Hedwig Dohm gave some impetus to the feminist movement in Germany with her writings during the late 19th century, with her argument that women's roles were created by society rather than being a biological imperative. During this period, a wider range of feminist writings from other languages were being translated into German, deepening the feminist discourse further for German women. =Access to education= In Sex in Education, Or, A Fair Chance for Girls (1873), educator Edward H. Clarke researched educational standards in Germany. He found that by the 1870s, formal education for middle and upper-class girls was the norm in Germany's cities, although it ended at the onset of menarche, which typically happened when a girl was 15 or 16. After this, her education might continue at home with tutors or occasional lectures. Clarke concluded that \\"Evidently the notion that a boy's education and a girl's education should be the same, and that the same means the boy's, has not yet penetrated the German mind. This has not yet evolved the idea of the identical education of the sexes.\\" Education for peasant girls was not formal, and they learned farming and housekeeping tasks from their parents. This prepared them for a life of harsh labour on the farm. On a visit to Germany, Clarke observed that: Young middle class and upper-class women began to pressure their families and the universities to allow them access to higher education. Anita Augspurg, the first woman university graduate in Germany, graduated with a law degree from the University of Zurich, Switzerland. Several other German women, unable to gain admittance to German universities, also went to the University of Zurich to continue their education. In 1909, German universities finally allowed women to gain admittance—but women graduates were unable to practice their profession, as they were \\"barred from private practice and public administrative posts for lawyers\\". The first women's legal aid agency was established by Marie Stritt in 1894; by 1914, there were 97 such legal aid agencies, some employing women law graduates. Weimar Germany Following women's enfranchisement, women's rights made significant gains in Germany during the Weimar Republic. The Weimar Constitution of 1919 enacted equality in education for the sexes, equal opportunity in civil service appointments, and equal pay in the professions. These changes put Germany in the group of advanced countries in terms of women's legal rights (Czechoslovakia, Iceland, Lithuania and the Soviet Union also had no distinction between the sexes in the professions, while countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Norway held onto restrictions to the professions for women throughout the inter-war period). Germany's Reichstag had 32 women deputies in 1926 (6.7% of the Reichstag), giving women representation at the national level that surpassed countries such as Great Britain (2.1% of the House of Commons) and the United States (1.1% of the House of Representatives); this climbed to 35 women deputies in the Reichstag in 1933 on the eve of the Nazi dictatorship, when Great Britain still had only 15 women members in the House of Commons. The umbrella group of feminist organizations, the Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine (BDF; Federation of German Women's Associations), remained the dominant force in German feminism during the inter-war period. It had around 300,000 members at the start of World War I, growing to over 900,000 members during the 1920s; it has been noted, however, that the middle-class membership was far from radical, and promoted maternal \\"clichés\\" and \\"bourgeois responsibilities\\". Other feminist groups were organized around religious faiths, and there were many Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish feminist groups. Prominent feminists of this era included Helene Lange (founding BDF board member and women's suffrage activist who served in the Hamburg Senate), her life partner Gertrud Bäumer (writer and Reichstag delegate from 1919 to 1932), Helene Stöcker (pacifist, gender activist, writer and feminist journal editor), and Clara Zetkin (Marxist theorist, women's rights activist, and KPD Reichstag delegate from 1920 to 1933). The 1920s also saw the rise of the \\"New Woman\\" (Neue Frau), as portrayed by authors such as Elsa Herrmann (So ist die neue Frau, 1929) and Irmgard Keun (Das kunstseidene Mädchen, 1932, translated as The Artificial Silk Girl, 1933).

Along with the economic chaos of the inter-war years, Weimar culture in general had a degree of social chaos, which was experienced in the city of Berlin in particular. War widows and their children struggled to earn a living in a city where hunger, unemployment, and crime were rampant. At the same time, a liberation of social mores meant that women had a social freedom they had not experienced until then. Socialists and communists in particular became open in demanding free access to contraception and abortion, asserting, \\"Your body belongs to you\\". Nazi era Historians have paid special attention to Nazi Germany's efforts to reverse the gains that women made before 1933, especially during the liberal Weimar Republic. It appears the role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances. Theoretically, the Nazis believed that women must be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be a helpmate of the traditional dominant father in the traditional family. However, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth. As Germany prepared for war, large numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the employment office. Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control. In 1934, Hitler proclaimed, \\"[A woman's] world is her husband, her family, her children, her house.\\" Women's highest calling was motherhood. Laws that had protected women's rights were repealed and new laws were introduced to restrict women to the home and in their roles as wives and mothers. Women were barred from government and university positions. Women's rights groups, such as the moderate BDF, were disbanded, and replaced with new social groups that would reinforce Nazi values, under the leadership of the Nazi Party and the head of women's affairs in Nazi Germany, Reichsfrauenführerin Gertrud Scholtz-Klink. In 1944–45, more than 500,000 women volunteers were uniformed auxiliaries in the German armed forces (Wehrmacht). About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses, and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy. In the Luftwaffe, they served in combat roles helping to operate the anti—aircraft systems that shot down Allied bombers. West Germany, East Germany Women workers in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), 1958. Alice Schwarzer, founder of EMMA (magazine) and Germany's most prominent feminist, 2010. During the post-War period Political life in the Federal Republic of Germany was conservative in character: Demographic changes which resulted from World War II meant that women made up a larger proportion of the electorate for several decades, but this did not result in significant representation in government; by 1987, women still made up only 10% of the representatives in the Bundestag. Women had less education, and they were less likely to be employed, either in the professions, or the service industry. Yet, after the Federal Republic of Germany began to make strides in its recovery from the aftermath of World War II, feminist issues began to rise to the surface of public consciousness. The works of feminist writers such as Betty Friedan were translated into German, and a new generation of German feminists began to agitate for social change. A disillusionment with conventional political parties, and even with standard Marxist activism, led to the growth of the radical left during the 1970s, including militant groups. Rote Zora was one anti-patriarchy terrorist group; while it carried out an estimated 45 bombings and arson attacks between 1974 and 1995, it accomplished little. A development in the Left that had a longer- lasting impact was the establishment of the Green Party in 1980. Feminists pushed the Green Party to include abortion reform as an \\"unqualified party commitment\\", and as more feminists became part of the Party leadership, women's rights were brought to prominence by the mid-1980s. West Germany's most well-known feminist, the \\"mediagenic\\" Alice Schwarzer, founded the popular feminist magazine EMMA in 1977, and remains its Editor-in-Chief. State socialism in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) ostensibly meant equality between the sexes. Marxist writers such as Frederick Engels, August Bebel, and Clara Zetkin had written of the role of gender exploitation in capitalism. In the GDR, there was little public consciousness of conflict between the sexes, although women's rights were discussed by certain activist groups, drawing Stasi attention. The official GDR line during the 1960s and 1970s was that the Western feminist movement was \\"man-hating\\". Women in the GDR were reputed to have a more exhausting way of life than women in the FRG, for a number of reasons. In addition to a longer formal workweek for GDR workers, women performed three-quarters of the housework and childcare. Few people owned cars, and product shortages and long lines made errands such as grocery shopping more time-consuming. Although men were entitled to one year of parental leave following the birth of a child, they did not actually take it. By the 1970s, some GDR writers were observing that women's social roles were lagging their legal and economic status. Until 1977 married women in West Germany could not work without permission from their husbands.https://www.euronews.com/amp/2019/01/17/germany-celebrates-100-years- of-women-s-suffrage However, women began to receive extensions to paid maternity leave that were generous by Western standards. Feminism in Germany since Unification By the early 21st century, issues of intersectionality between diverse social groups gained the attention of a larger number of feminists and other social reformers in Germany and beyond. After decades of pushing for greater legal recognition as full citizens, Gastarbeiter (guest workers) and their children (often born and raised in Germany) won some reforms at the national level in the late 1990s. During this time, women's rights groups had not, in general, made the guest worker issue a feminist cause. There were sporadic instances of women's rights groups voicing support for women guest workers' right to vote, and to have other women's rights included in the government's 1998 draft law for guest workers. Before 1997, the definition of rape in Germany was: \\"Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years’ imprisonment\\". In 1997 there were changes to the rape law, broadening the definition, making it gender-neutral, and removing the marital exemption. Before, marital rape could only be prosecuted as \\"Causing bodily harm\\" (Section 223 of the German Criminal Code), \\"Insult\\" (Section 185 of the German Criminal Code) and \\"Using threats or force to cause a person to do, suffer or omit an act\\" (Nötigung, Section 240 of the German Criminal Code) which carried lower sentences and were rarely prosecuted. Networked feminism, where women's rights activists communicate and organize using social media, is a growing trend among younger feminists in Germany. The Ukrainian feminist organization FEMEN, established in 2008, has spread to Germany as of 2013. Chapters have been founded in Berlin and Hamburg. In late 2012 and early 2013, Twitter became the medium of mass protests against common types of sexist harassment. Using a hashtag called #aufschrei (outcry), more than 100,000 tweets (messages) were sent to protest personal experiences of harassment, raising awareness of the issue and generating national and international press coverage. Women's representation in government and the workforce has made progress in the early 21st century. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has established her key role in European politics. Merkel's time in office has not been without controversy related to women's rights legislation; in 2013, she opposed an EU proposal to introduce 40-percent female quota on executive boards in all publicly listed companies with more than 250 employees by 2020, on the basis that this was a violation of member states' affairs. Germany's Labour Minister, Ursula von der Leyen, a supporter of the quota in Germany, received a written order from Merkel to \\"alter her ministry's lack of an objection to the EU directive, so that the cabinet could present a unified face to Germany's EU officials\\". However, in March 2015 the SPD party won the battle on female quota. A new law requires about 100 companies to appoint women on 30 percent of their supervisory board seats, beginning in 2016. In addition, 3,500 companies are required to submit plans to increase the female share in top positions.

A tenet of the church is that force should not be used, even in self-defense. It numbers approximately 100 members. Foundation The church was founded in 1871. The Reverend Samuel Rufus Harshman (November 30, 1841 - January 9, 1912), who organized the church, had a dairy herd and ran a delivery wagon in Sullivan, Illinois to supply fresh milk for 5 cents a quart. Harshman was a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, but did not believe the Methodist church was sufficiently pacifist. For this reason, he founded a separate church. One of the church's basic principles is to follow Christ's command to \\"love thy neighbor as thyself,\\" which it interprets as prohibiting violence. History During World War I there was so much hostility to the church that its members could not find jobs. Some of them formed a small factory, employing church and non-church workers, that made ladies' aprons, candy, and later branched into garden tractors and tools. One night the Harshmanite church was painted yellow, a reference to cowardice. An 82-year-old assistant minister was knocked down. However, the Harshmanites would not prosecute on the basis that such an undertaking was proscribed by the biblical statement \\"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord\\"(Romans 12:19). In response to the depression of the 1930s, the church members felt that Federal relief projects would not bring lasting prosperity. They expanded their \\"Community Industries\\" as a way to provide employment. During World War II the candy operation was unable to obtain sugar unless it agreed to sell some of its products to the armed forces, and a small amount was sold to the Air Force to be including in emergency survivor kits. The church also sold ladies dresses for use by women in the Armed Forces. For these reasons, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit decided on 9 December 1954 that the church had contributed to the war effort and its members could therefore not be considered conscientious objectors. This was later reversed, and members of the church who refused induction into the armed forces were again treated as Conscientious Objectors. In 1955 a member of the church declined to use the word \\"solemnly\\" in affirming to tell the truth in court. The court refused his testimony. However, an appeals court found that he was not required to use this word, or any particular form of oath, but only \\"a form or statement which impresses upon the mind and conscience of a witness the necessity for telling the truth.\\" Community Industries achieved no small measure of success for a time. In 1964 it had assets of approximately $3,800,000.00 and about 400 employees. Following losses suffered in the recession of 1957-58, however, its business declined, and after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1966, it was subsequently dissolved. Some of its divisions apparently continued operations under new names or ownership, such as Agri-Fab, Inc.

In 2011, his second year at Bezalel, Heymann created three videos as homework assignments, receiving a total of more than 1 Million views on YouTube. The first video was a homage to the French series Bref, in which the video tells (very quickly) the story of a failed blind date. The second video was \\"Der Mensch\\" an opening title sequence for a would be Orthodox Western, whose main character frees Agunot. The third video was \\"shelf life,\\" in which Heymann animated characters on food packaging in the refrigerator; the third video caught the attention of mainstream media in Israel. In May 2012, a music video Heymann directed for Asaf Avidan was released. the music video for the single \\"Different Pulses\\" had 3.5 million views on YouTube and was even named \\"Video of the Year\\" by some. In 2012, Heymann created commercial work, his first ad was made for Pepsi and was a collaboration with comedian Roy Kafri - the two created together a one-minute spot for the drink Pepsi Max. Heymann later made a campaign for Pepsi Max involving an augmented reality app he created. Roy Kafri and Heymann also created an ad for a small start-up starring model Bar Refaeli, the ad was a Macabre one-minute musical. The two also collaborated on a music video for one of Kafri's popular songs (\\"Yes I Did Approach Ido\\"). In October 2012 Heymann created a music video for the song \\"Young Professionals\\" by The Young Professionals it was a commercial collaboration with the American Express Company. Film directing career In January 2013, the TV program Eretz Nehederet (\\"Wonderful Country\\")of Channel 2 broadcast a series called Bekizur (\\"in short\\") adapted from the French series, Bref, composed of two-minute episodes. Heymann directed the series and participated in writing the Hebrew script. In April 2013 Heymann created another beer commercial this time for Maccabee beer, featuring Isaiah Mustafa. A YouTube video of the ad received one million hits. In November 2013, the website of Bob Dylan released an interactive music video which Heymann created and directed for the song \\"Like a Rolling Stone; this song was first released in 1965 and had not previously had an authorized video. The video allows viewers to flip through 16 television channels, which all feature characters who are lip-syncing the lyrics of the song. In December 2013, Time Magazine named the video best music video of 2013. The video has since won many prizes including a Webby Award for Best Editing and 4 Gold Lions at the Cannes Lions in the Film Craft, Direct, and Branded Content & Entertainment categories. In 2015, Heymann continued releasing traditional video work along with interactive projects. In June 2015, an interactive mobile project he created for Canadian group Keys N' Krates single \\"Save me\\" was released, the video was an experiment in what could be considered the world's first mobile music video to act as a social network, allowing the users to scroll through thousands of fan sourced gifs that are essentially photobombed by the band. In July 2015 CeeLo Green released \\"Robin Williams\\" a first single from an album expected later in 2015, the song was released alongside an interactive video showing the song's lyrics typed in a Google search bar, with each word generating different results. Viewers are able to seamlessly toggle between Google, Google Images, Google Shopping and Google Videos to see what comes up via each lyric.

The line closely follows the Alsenz river from the Enkenbach district and crosses it several times. It was originally built primarily as a long-distance route, but it has lost this function since 1990 and is now exclusively used for local transport. Route Between Enkenbach and Bad Münster the line has continuous double track; only the Enkenbach–Hochspeyer section is single track. From Enkenbach the line follows the Alsenz river to Alsenz. Due to the difficult topographical conditions, the line has to cross the Alsenz river several times and has three tunnels. It runs along the edge of the Palatinate Forest to about Langmeil, where it enters the North Palatine Uplands. From Hochspeyer to the abandoned Neuhemsbach station the line is within the district of Kaiserslautern, from Münchweiler an der Alsenz to the Alsenz municipality it is in Donnersbergkreis and the remaining section is located in the district of Bad Kreuznach. History From 1859 there was a continuous north-south trunk line from the Rhineland via Rhenish Hesse to Ludwigshafen in the form of the West Rhine Railway between Cologne and Mainz and the Mainz–Ludwigshafen railway. But the lines running via Mainz were indirect, so plans emerged for the building of a shorter line from about Bingen am Rhein south along the Alsenz to the catchment area of the Donnersberg via Enkenbach and from there towards Neustadt. In order to take account of the interests of the city of Kaiserslautern, a connection curve was created south of Fischbach to Hochspeyer to allow appropriate movements. The Hochspeyer–Winnweiler section was opened on 29 October 1870. The Winnweiler–Bad Munster am Stein section followed on 16 May 1871. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and 1871 there was an increased interest in building strategic railways in southwest Germany. There were demands for a direct connection between Kaiserslautern and Enkenbach, as the existing route via Hochspeyer was considered too roundabout for this purpose. The city of Kaiserslautern made land available for the proposed line. The connection between Kaiserslautern and Enkenbach was opened on 15 May 1875. The line included the stations of Kaiserslautern Nord and Eselsfürth. Development up to the Second World War (1875–1945) Alsenz Valley Railway was operated by the Palatine Northern Railway Company (Gesellschaft der Pfälzischen Nordbahnen) and functioned as its main line. The Bad Münster–Enkenbach section was frequented by the 1920s by long-distance trains on the Cologne–Bingen–Neustadt–Landau–Wissembourg–Strasbourg route. However, after Alsace was ceded to France after the First World War, the line lost much of its traffic towards Neustadt. Since the Enkenbach–Eselsfürth–Kaiserslautern route is shorter than the route via Hochspeyer, most trains approach Kaiserslautern via Eselsfürth. After the Zeller Valley Railway (Zellertalbahn) was completed from Langmeil to Monsheim) in 1873 and the Donnersberg Railway (Donnersbergbahn) was completed from Alzey to Marnheim in 1874, the section between Kaiserslautern and Langmeil also carried long-distance trains to the Rhine-Main area via Worms to Frankfurt or via Alzey to Mainz. The Eis Valley Railway (Eistalbahn) was opened in 1876 from Grünstadt to Eisenberg and connected to Enkenbach in 1932. Some of its services connected with Kaiserslautern. In 1942, during the Second World War, a major accident occurred on the line: in the morning a military train and a freight train collided with each other in Enkenbach. The incident killed two people and wounded many others. A greater tragedy was avoided because the first two carriages of the military train were only lightly occupied. Deutsche Bundesbahn and Deutsche Bahn (since 1945) After the Second World War, several intermediate stops (Neuhemsbach, Dielkirchen, Bayerfeld- Colln, Mannweiler, Ebernburg) were abandoned due to low patronage. After all the connecting lines, the Eis Valley Railway, the Zeller Valley Railway and the Donnersberg Railway, had been closed for passenger services between 1983 and 1994, the Alsenz Valley Railway was the only line that was in full operation in the Donnersbergkreis. The narrow-gauge railway to Obermoschel had already been closed in the 1930s. In 1970, the Hochstein tunnel, also called the Eisenschmelz tunnel, located at kilometre 19, was converted into a cutting. Until 1990 the line was also served by a Schnellzug (express) on the Paris Est–Metz–Saarbrücken–Kaiserslautern–Bad Kreuznach–Mainz–Frankfurt am Main route, which was operated until the mid-1970s with SNCF DEV Inox cars and then by Corail cars. Between 1988 and 1990 they were partially replaced by express services from Pirmasens via Kaiserslautern and Bingen to Cologne. Since then, these trains have been abandoned and the Alsenz Valley Railway has lost all long-distance services. In 1999, a new station was set up in Münchweiler an der Alsenz between Langmeil and the abandoned station of Neuhemsbach. Consequently, the Langmeil station, which had previously been used by Münchweiler's population, lost its importance, which led to it being abandoned in late 2006. Even with the recommencement of services on Sundays and public holidays in 2001 on the now reactivated Zeller Valley Railway, trains no longer serve this once important junction station. As part of the expanded Rhineland-Palatinate integrated regular-interval timetable being introduced from 2015, new Regional-Express services will be introduced on the Koblenz–Bingen–Bad Kreuznach–Kaiserslautern route (from December 2016) and the Mainz–Bad Kreuznach–Kaiserslautern route (from December 2014). They will both run on the Alsenz Valley Railway and be operated by Netinera. Operations Deutsche Bahn operates hourly services on the line. It is listed in the Deutsche Bahn timetable (KBS) as line 672. Until the timetable change in December 2008, the services continued over the Biebermühl Railway to Pirmasens; since then only Regionalbahn services have run between Kaiserslautern and Bingen. From Kaiserslautern to Alsenz, the line runs within the area of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) and from Hochstätten to Bad Münster it is within the area of the Rhein-Nahe Nahverkehrsverbund (Rhine-Nahe Transport Association, RNN). On Sundays and public holidays in the summer, the Rheintalexpress runs on the Bingen–Enkenbach section to Karlsruhe and the Weinstraßen-Express runs to Wissembourg, each stopping in Enkenbach, Rockhausen, Bad Münster and Bad Kreuznach and each consisting of push–pull trains hauled by class 218 locomotives or class 628 diesel multiple units. Furthermore, the Langmeil–Hochspeyer section is served in the summer on Sundays and public holidays by daily services on the Zeller Valley Railway route. Rolling stock In 2000, 628 diesel multiple units were replaced by modern Talent railcars of class 643. Since the timetable change in December 2008, Desiro trains of class 642 also operate. Previously, local services were mostly operated with Silberling carriages. These were hauled diesel locomotives of class 218; in the winter coupled French locomotives were also sometimes used. Future There are plans to electrify and upgrade the line along with the Palatine Maximilian Railway to relieve the Rhine Valley lines between Bingen and Karlsruhe of freight trains. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate has recommended the project for the 2015 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan).

Description The King betta generally grows to about 5–6 cm (2–2 1/2 in). Its pigments are generally vibrant beige to a white. As with most bettas, King betta females are smaller and less colorful than the males. The life span of the King betta is short, generally 2–3 years, rarely reaching four. The King betta is (as are all other bettas) members of the gourami family (Osphronemidae) and prefers a temperature of 78–82 °F. History Hardly anything is known about the King betta. Some people say that Betta raja and Betta splendens cross bred in nature to create the King betta we know today. Others suppose that the King betta was bred from wild stock of B. raja. Diet King bettas eat fish flakes, pellets, bloodworms and freeze-dried brine shrimp. Behavior Male and female king bettas flare or puff out their gills in order to appear more impressive, either to intimidate rivals or attract mates, as well as when they’re startled. Females often flare their gills at other females (rare in B. splendens.) All bettas require a place to hide occasionally, even in solitary tanks. They may set up a territory centered on a plant or rock, which they will guard aggressively. This breed is not appropriate for a typical community tank due to its aggressiveness, particularly towards species of fish with long, flowing fins. Maintenance When maintaining the aquariums for this breed, instead of using substrate, breeders go for driftwood roots or branches, bark of Beech or oak and position them in a way that offers some kind of shades to the fish. To add to the natural environment, dry leaves are also used, which along with the Tannin from the wood, act as a supplement fish food when decomposed. For king bettas, always dim lighting and aquatic vegetation like Microsorum pteropus and Taxiphyllum barbieri is advised. A sprinkling of floating aquatic plants also help to maintain the lighting in the tank. An air-powered sponge filter in place of other forms of filtration gadgets are preferred. As these species tend to make jumps, the tank should be covered, but care should be taken not to fill it to the brim as the fish seek the humid air that develops in the empty space.

In 1836 Sir Archibald Geikie recorded the movement of a block of gneiss across of ground during a violent storm.Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 207-209.Murray (1996) p. 221.Murray (1966) p. 232. History Designed by Robert Stevenson and built by James Smith of Inverness the light was first exhibited on 15 October 1833.Munro (1979) p. 89. The oil-burning light was converted to incandescent in 1906 and the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation on 23 October 1980, when the last keepers were withdrawn. The main optic is now an acetylene-operated Dalen revolving pedestal. The fresnel lens rotates every 30 seconds. During daylight hours, the lens rotates at a very slow speed to prevent the mantles from deteriorating in strong sunlight. There are 4 mantles in the exchanger systems. Electrical power is provided by batteries, which are automatically recharged by a diesel alternator twice a week. The equipment is monitored by Hyskeir Lighthouse. Due to the dangerous landing conditions, Barra Head lighthouse was re-classified by the RNLI as a \\"Rock Station\\" early in the 20th century. Two small boats had been swamped and lost in the enormous swell by the slipway at the landing place. The regulations associated with this change prevented both alongside landings by tenders and the lighthouse men keeping dinghies onshore.\\"The Most Dangerous Landing in Scotland\\" safetybarrahead.com. Retrieved 30 December 2008.Munro (1979) p. 191 states that one of these accidents occurred \\"in the storms of 1877-8\\".

The keepers' cemetery The pier was built in the late 1930s with the approach of war, when a sophisticated radar system was installed to guard the Western Approaches. This involved the landing of hundreds of steel girders and drums containing steel cables used to create three large radar masts, and a robust \\"Scots Derrick\\" was erected to crane them ashore. A small walled cemetery was constructed halfway between the lighthouse and the summit of Sotan for the keepers. This contains the grave of a visiting inspector and those of a number of the keepers' children.Buxton (1995) p. 147.

Description The composition depicts the upper reaches of the Grand Canal near the entrance to the Cannaregio Canal. It is a typical example of the vedute paintings popular with Grand Tour travelers as a visual record of their stay in Venice. The viewer's vantage point is in the middle of the canal, surrounded by gondolas, barges, and the buildings lining the banks. Many of the structures depicted by Canaletto still stand today, for example Palazzo Flangini, the building at far left, which retains its off-center entrance portal.\\"Palazzo Flangini, Venice\\", photograph by Gunther H.G.

The trees appearing over a garden wall mark the corner of the Grand Canal and the Cannaregio Canal, which branches off to the left. The garden belongs to Palazzo Labia, the first building on the Cannaregio Canal, adjacent to San Geremia but hidden from view in the painting. The very last building visible in the background of the painting is Palazzo Vendramin Calergi, partly cut off due to the canal's curve to the right.

Born in Hull, the son of shipbroker John Henry Arnold Reinold, he received his early education at the St Peter's School, York. In 1863 he matriculated to Brasenose College, Oxford where he studied mathematics. He became a fellow of Merton College, Oxford in December, 1866; a position which he resigned in 1869 upon marrying Marian Owen—the couple would have one daughter and three sons. In 1869 he was appointed the first Lee's Reader in Physics at Christ Church, and was awarded an M.A. in 1870. In 1871 he was named Examiner in Physics at Oxford. When the Royal Naval College, Greenwich was established in 1873, he was appointed Professor of Physics there; a post he would hold for the next 35 years. During most of his period at Greenwich he was a lecturer at Guy's Hospital. Between 1877–93, he collaborated with English physicist Arthur William Rucker on series of papers about the properties of thin films. He was named a fellow of the Royal Society in 1883. During 1874–88 he was honorable secretary for the Physical Society of London, whereupon he was elected as president of the body.

The stable was also used during the early years of the Rose Parade as both a float construction site and a site for hitching horses to wagons.

After playing college football for Colorado State University, he was signed by the Falcons as an undrafted free agent in 2013. Early years \\"Momo\\" was born in Kissimmee, Florida, to Barry Thomas and Alousa Chappell. He has 11 siblings. His brothers are Greg, Javon, Richard, Tyuan and Santae. His sisters are Sophia, Shala, Theila, Kayla and Chardae. His family friend T'Sharvan Bell joined him at Osceola High. Bobby Sippio, his cousin, played football as a wide receiver for Western Kentucky University in college, and now plays in the National Football League (NFL) for the Kansas City Chiefs . Amar'e Stoudemire has been a close family friend of his. College career 2008 season Out of the 13 games that Colorado State University played in 2008, Thomas got playing time in all of them as a Freshman, starting 10 times, with the inclusion of the New Mexico Bowl. He was 1/5 of the CSU true Freashmen that year. He finished the year off with 54 tackles, 38 of them being solo tackles. Three of these 54 tackles had also been for a loss. He broke up three passes and had an interception, which would have been a touchdown, if it weren't for a penalty that was called against them. 2009 season His playing time had been cut short two games from the previous year, only playing in 11 games. His starts had also dropped by two, starting in 8 games. Because of this, of course, his stats had dropped from the 2008 season as well, but not drastically. He still managed to earn 43 tackles, with one being for a loss of yards. He had made 31 of these tackles solo. He snatched an interception in addition. 2010 season As a Junior, he had to undergo surgery for his right shoulder. This forced Gerard to miss the majority of the season. He had only managed to get 13 tackles, 8 solo. Although he got another interception, too. 2011 season Back after shoulder surgery in 2010, he played in 11 games, starting in every one. His interception stat had increased by one, catching two of them. He recorded 31 tackles, one for a loss, 15 solo. With one of those tackles, he had forced the ballcarrier to fumble. He forced one, and recovered a fumble, too. To top it all off, he had 7 pass breakups. 2012 season It was a disappointing season in 2012, as \\"Momo\\" started in the first three games for the Rams before hurting his shoulder and ending his season. However, he got drafted by the Eagles, and participated in several Rookie Camps. Professional career Thomas signed with the Atlanta Falcons as an undrafted free agent on April 29, 2013.

This may be requested by the prosecution or defense in order to protect the jury from the media, potential jury tampering, or social pressure to return a particular verdict. In some cases, the identity of the jury is not revealed to anyone; in other cases, the identity of the jury is revealed to the prosecution and defense, but not released to the public or media. In most jurisdictions, several criteria are used to determine if an anonymous jury is appropriate. The defendant's involvement in organized crime, the defendant's participation in a group with the capacity to harm jurors, the defendant's past attempts to interfere with the judicial process, the potential that the defendant will get a long jail sentence or substantial fines if convicted, and extensive publicity that could expose jurors to intimidation or harassment are situations in which an innominate jury may be appropriate. Notable cases * Leroy Barnes: 1977 trial of a drug kingpin.

Asking Jesus into one's heart is a description of personal conversion used in evangelicalism. It is often regarded as a component of the sinner's prayer. Paul Chitwood notes that the concept \\"does not occur readily before the turn of the twentieth century,\\" but had \\"become the common way of expressing conversion by the mid-part of the twentieth century.\\" The phrase does not occur in the Bible, and it has frequently been criticized. R. Larry Moyer lists \\"If you want to be saved, just invite Jesus into your heart\\" as one of the things that God never said. Moyer suggests that Revelation 3:20 (\\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me\\", KJV) is the only verse that could be considered to support the concept, but notes that the verse is addressed to Christians rather than non-Christians.Moyer, p. 36. Moyer argues that the phrase \\"often conveys the idea that one is saved by saying a prayer instead of trusting Christ.\\"Moyer, p. 39. In his book Stop Asking Jesus Into Your Heart: How to Know for Sure You Are Saved, J. D. Greear argues that asking Jesus into one's heart is not the same as believing the gospel. Greear relates how he asked Jesus into his heart several thousand times \\"until he came to put his faith in the truth of the gospel instead.\\" Writing from a Calvinist perspective, Michael Horton regards asking Jesus into one's heart as a \\"popular misconception of the gospel\\", on the basis that \\"it is the objective work of Christ outside of us\\" that \\"makes the gospel truly Good News\\". Horton goes on to argue that \\"salvation by asking Jesus into your heart typically assumes that the Good News is merely something that God offers, but the hearer is then commanded to do something - however small - in order to actually make this salvation effective.\\" In traditional Christianity, whether Catholic or Orthodox, the Protestant concept of \\"accepting Jesus into one's heart\\" is seen as alien to the Gospel, as salvation is a lifelong process, not something done in a singular moment. They also point out that this notion came about 1,800 after Christ, during the Second Great Awakening in America.

Plot Junior high school student, Shōyō Hinata, becomes obsessed with volleyball after catching a glimpse of Karasuno High School winning their game to qualify for Nationals on TV. Of short stature himself, Hinata is inspired by a player the commentators nickname 'The Little Giant', Karasuno's short but talented wing spiker. Though inexperienced, Hinata is athletic and has an impressive vertical jump; he joins his school's volleyball club – only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to spend the next two years trying to convince other students to help him practice. In his third and final year of Junior High, some of Hinata's friends agree to join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his first official game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team favoured to win the tournament – including third- year Tobio Kageyama, a prodigy setter nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for both his skill and his tyrannical play style. The two spark a short rivalry, and following the game, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama in high school.

Anime In November 2019, Polygon named Haikyu!! one of the best anime of the 2010s, and Crunchyroll listed it in their \\"Top 100 best anime of the 2010s\\". IGN also listed Haikyu!! among the best anime series of the 2010s, and nominated it for Best Anime Series of 2016. According to Crunchyroll, Haikyu!! was one of the top 10 streamed animes in the UK, Canada, Oceania, Mexico, and Brazil on their streaming service during the winter 2020 anime season. Kim Yeon-kyoung, captain of the South Korean National Women's Volleyball team, reacted to and analyzed Karasuno's final rally against Aoba Johsai in season 2, expressing that while a few moments were exaggerated and impossible to do in real life, she was pleasantly surprised by its portrayal of high-level volleyball and thought it was \\"fun to watch\\". She noted that the creator \\"is a person with a high level of volleyball knowledge\\". Melina Dargis of The Fandom Post praised its development of a team mentality with multiple characters rather than individuals, serving to emphasize that volleyball \\"... is not an individual event, but a team sport\\". Noelle Ogawa of Crunchyroll praised it for its portrayal of personal growth, emphasizing its dependence on having the \\"right people and the right environment to bloom in.\\" Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network commented on the development of non-players like Karasuno's team manager, Kiyoko, stating that \\"her triumphant jump as she brings Hinata his lost sneakers is a beautiful statement of the fact that she's just as much a part of the team as any of the boys\\". Silverman also comments on the anime's attention to detail, noting the inclusion of deep breaths in, the movement of muscles in player's legs, and point of view shots that follow the ball during rallies. Isaac Ackers applauded the anime for its creation of intensity without having to use the speed of real-life sports, noting that it \\"[tightens] its focus on individual moments, making each point a peak and each second leading up to those peaks essential. Instead of speeding up, it slows down. It hangs on specific plays, stretches out the time the volleyball is in the air, emphasizes the moments in between. It’s simple, but it’s sublimely effective.\\" Rafael Motamayor of Slash Film commended the anime, stating that \\"the best part of Haikyu!! is the way the show integrates relationships and character stories into the actual sport\\", noting that \\"what may look like a simple toss suddenly turns into a vital lesson in building trust with your teammates, and the planning and staging of a spike also means addressing and confronting years of self-hatred and doubts\\". He also complimented the combination of Production I.G's fluid animation and Yuki Hayashi's soundtrack, which \\"[elevate] a simple game into an operatic duel of fates\\", with \\"visual metaphors that [turn] every pass into a battle\\". Guillermo Kurten of Comic Book Resources praised Haikyu!! for its outstanding characterization and for its execution of an entertaining story, even for those who do not enjoy sports or have no volleyball knowledge. K. Thor Jensen of Mashable listed it on his list of the best sports anime. References External links * Official Haikyu!! website * Official Haikyu!!

The design itself was part of an array of entries from multiple architects into the 1957 Hauptstadt Berlin competition. Its reinvigorated approach to architecture, especially in its attitude toward the idea of transportation and mobility, grants it an important role in the post-war period.Smithson, Alison Margaret, Peter Smithson Alison and Peter Smithson: From the house of the Future to a House of Today Rotterdam: 010 2004 p. 61  History  Following the devastation of Germany after World War II, the country faced a long period of upheaval and reconstruction. In 1957, the government of West Germany came to the decision to hold an architectural competition to rebuild the center of Berlin, including sections belonging to East Germany in an attempt to unify the divided city.Sadler, Simon The Situationist City MIT 1999 p. 118 The Smithsons took this opportunity to expand their architecture to a much grander scale in hopes that they would be able to revolutionize the idea of the city in its focus on the pedestrian as opposed to the automobile.  Architecture  The majority of housing structures contained within the plan for Hauptstadt were meant to be those created by the Smithsons for their Golden Lane project. By building the center of Berlin in such a manner, it would allow for simple expansion by way of the Golden Lane design. In using this construction, the buildings would stem out from central cores into cells. Aside from the cellular structure, the plan was also meant to be formed with interwoven layers; this method of urban planning was a popular Team 10 idea known as mat- building that can also be seen in the Free University of Berlin project by the architectural firm of Candilis-Josic-Woods. In doing so, Hauptstadt was made to change, itself representing a living, breathing organism. The Smithsons themselves had stated in regard to this approach and its cellular design that it would allow, “the feeling for change, so that buildings, roads and services can develop freely according to their own laws without compromising the development as a whole.”  Functions  Hauptstadt was to be broken into various corridors, each with separate function. Encapsulating the city on one side would be what was known as the “Chinese wall of offices and wholesale houses,\\" garnering its name from The Great Wall of China. The largest portion in the center of the plan was the “commercial city,” containing the greatest number of pedestrian corridors as well as shopping centers. This sector would be accessed via parking structures along its border, and their subsequent escalators leading to corridors themselves. In addition to shopping zones, this central area would contain a large circular “museum of technology” that would also act as an epicenter of management.http://hacedordetrampas.blogspot.com/2011/02/proyecto-berlin- hauptstadt-de-ap.html In smaller segments adjacent to the “commercial city” was the house of government and ministry buildings dotted along its perimeter. Finally an administration sector operated on the rightmost side of the plan with its own separate parking structures.  Mobility  Hauptstadt was to take the idea of the city to a brand new level in its relation to the individual. Keeping in the style of Le Corbusier, the plan was designed such that there would be separate pedestrian and automobile corridors, allowing for a greater sense of connectivity in that any individual will never experience the same thing more than once, shying away from automation of life.http://cityform.mit.edu/files/Projections10_ferrer-fores.pdf This space was meant to be experienced, giving its inhabitants a greater chance to encounter new and exciting things through its ease of use overall. By separating the sidewalk from the road, people could move freely on foot without fear of vehicles and vice versa for drivers. Escalators were to be used to access the pedestrian corridor from the street level. This dual-layer technique was meant to emphasize remnants of the city on the upper level, while still keeping with the new structures.  References  *Mumford, Eric Paul.

Growing up in a family of professional musicians, Peterson started with music at a very young age. Billy is brother of Paul Peterson (bass guitarist/singer/songwriter/keyboardist) and Ricky Peterson (keyboardist/singer/song writer/producer). Career Early career In 1967, he joined The Righteous Brothers on a summer tour. While going to school, Peterson played bass and drums in local orchestras, big bands, R&B; bands and toured with the Lawrence Welk Show All Stars. After high-school, he started playing bass with trumpet-legend Clifford Brown's pianist Billy Wallace until 1973. In the mid 1970s, he was the bassist on three albums of folk guitarist Leo Kottke and also the electric and upright bassist on Bob Dylan's multi-platinum album Blood On The Tracks for Columbia Records. In 1976, he joined the Gibson guitar staff giving him the opportunity to perform with B.B. King, Johnny Smith, Lenny Breau, Les Paul, and Howard Roberts. During this decade record producer and engineer David Rivkin (aka David Z, who produced Prince in the 1980s) introduced Peterson to keyboardist Ben Sidran, a beginning of a musical partnership remaining strong till today. He released his first solo album “Threshold of Surrender” in 1981. While continuing to tour the US and Europe with various artists, he recorded many albums plus national radio and TV commercials performing from solo bass to playing with a full symphony orchestra. With the Steve Miller Band In 1986, Ben Sidran produced an album for Steve Miller and hired Peterson to play bass on the recording Born to be Blue. Afterwards Peterson became a member of the Steve Miller Band for 23 years, until 2010. He started to tour with the Steve Miller Band in spring 1987 and played bass on the Born to Be Blue (Capitol), Steve Miller Band Box Set (Capitol), and Wide River (Polydor) recordings, amongst numerous others.

In 1990 Peterson played on, produced and arranged Leo Kottke's album \\"That's What\\" for which he wrote a composition named “Mid Air”. Shortly after The Artist (also known as Prince) approached him to create a string arrangement for The New Power Generation's dynamo maven, Rosie Gaines.

(2003) Guide to Health Informatics. Great Britain: Hodder Education Studies have shown that protocols can aid in optimising patient care. There are two types of protocol systems: passive and active. In a healthcare setting, a protocol, also called a medical guideline, is a set of instructions which describe a process to be followed to investigate a particular set of findings in a patient, or the method which should be followed to control a certain disease.  Passive protocol systems  Passive protocol systems are a source of information which health care providers have the freedom to choose to consult or not; they are not intrinsically incorporated into the healthcare process. The purpose of a passive protocol system is to give healthcare providers access to information which may remind healthcare providers of steps during patient care which may otherwise be forgotten or changed.  Active protocol systems  Active protocol systems are specific guidelines for healthcare providers to follow. They are a central way which healthcare is delivered. Examples of active protocol systems include trigger-automated order entry systems and appointment scheduling. Active protocol systems may provide an explanation function which offers background information, definitions, risks, and the rationale that supports specific recommendations.

It is considered highly auspicious among all Sankashti Chaturthi days. Sankashti Chaturthi (संकष्टी चतुर्थी) also known as Sankata Hara Chaturthi is an auspicious day dedicated to Lord Ganesha. This day is celebrated in every Lunar month or Hindu calendar month on the fourth day of Krishna Paksha (dark lunar phase or the waning phase).About Sankashti Chaturthi & Angaraki Chaturthi History According to Hindu teachings, Angarak the son of Mother Earth and Bharadwaj Rishi, was an accomplished rishi and a great devotee of Lord Ganesha. He worshipped Lord Ganesha and sought his blessings. On Magh Krishna Chaturthi (the day was Tuesday), Lord Ganesha blessed him and asked him for a wish. Angarak expressed that his only wish was to be associated with Lord Ganesha’s name for forever. The Lord granted his wish and proclaimed that whoever worships Lord Ganesha on Angarika Chaturthi will be granted all that he/ she prays for. From that day onwards, Magh Krishna Chaturthi came to be known as Angarak Chaturthi. Details On the day of Angarika Sankashti Chaturthi, the devotees observe strict fast from morning till evening. They break the fast at night after having darshan/auspicious sight of the moon preceded by prayers and pooja of Lord Ganesha. The Angarika Chaturthi (angarak in Sanskrit means red like burning coal embers) Devotees believe their wishes would be fulfilled if they pray on this auspicious day. The fast of Sankashti Chaturthi is generally started from the day \\"Angarika Sankashti Chaturthi\\". Also Angarika Sankashti means deliverance during troubled times, hence observing this fast is believed to reduce a person's problems as Lord Ganesha symbolizes the remover of all obstacles and supreme lord of intelligence. Before moonlight the Ganapati Atharvashesha is recited to summon the blessings of Lord Ganesha. Legend Part 1: Sage Durvasa and Lord Indra’s meeting Once Sage Durvasa was travelling from Vaikuntha to Kailasa. He came upon Lord Indra who was spending time with the apsara Rambha. Lord Indra bowed before Sage Durvasa in reverence, and Sage Durvasa getting pleased, handed him a Parijata flower, and spoke the following words: “O Indra, this is a flower given by the lord which removes all the obstructions and the person whose head it will be placed will be victorious all around. He will be adored by the people first of all and will be the foremost of all gods. Mahalakshmi will not part company from him and follow him like a shadow. He will equate himself with Vishnu in knowledge, wisdom, prowess. He will be more powerful than all gods and will be valorous like Vishnu.” Sage Durvasa left after this and Lord Indra, still intoxicated with the presence of Rambha, placed the flower on the head of his elephant. The elephant thus got all the qualities that were ordained by the flower. The elephant then fought and defeated all other elephants and left Lord Indra. Thus destiny resulted in the elephant getting all the advantages associated with the blessings of the Parijata flower. If Indra had accepted the flower, he would have got all the qualities. But destiny, which is also a play of Vishnu, had other plans and it waited for the birth of Ganesha. Part 2: Lord Shani visits Kailasa on the occasion of Ganesha’s birth The second story is the occasion of the birth Lord Ganesha and the conversation between Goddess Parvati and Lord Shani. On the birth of Lord Ganesha, all the other Gods visited Kailasa to see him and bless him. Shani dev also came to Kailasa and requested Goddess Parvati to let him see Lord Ganesha. She granted him permission and Lord Shani stood there, casting his gaze downwards. He did not look at the child and was satisfied with just standing near Lord Ganesha. Goddess Parvati enquired about the reason why he wasn’t looking at Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani replied the following, \\"O Chaste Lady, all the people have to face the result of their deeds. Whatever good or bad deeds are done, they cannot be washed away even after completion of crores of kalpas. The jiva is born as Brahma, Indra and Surya because of his deeds and he is reborn as an animal because of his deeds. One achieves hell because of his deeds and also heaven because of his deeds. He comes a great king because of his own deeds and an ordinary servant because of his own deeds. He is born beautiful because of his own deeds and he becomes sick the same way. O mother, because of his own deeds he indulges into vices and by his own deeds he becomes detached from the world.\\" \\"The people become rich because of their own deeds and it is due to their own deeds that they become pauper. One gets a loving family because of his own deeds and one gets a bad family because of his own deeds. Because of his own deeds one gets the best of spouse and kids, and because of his own deeds he remains unmarried, or a wicked spouse or remains childless. O beloved of Shiva, I will tell you a secret story. In my childhood, I was a great devotee of Lord Krishna and I was always devoted to him. I always recited his name. My father married me to the daughter of Citraratha but I was always devoted to Tapas. Once when I engrossed in meditation on Lord Krishna, she came to me seeking attention. I was unaware of her presence, being engrossed in meditation, and hence I kept on performing tapas. She became annoyed and pronounced a curse in anger that whatever I cast my glance on would be destroyed. Thereafter after getting out of meditation, I calmed her and she repented. O mother, because of the curse, I cannot cast my gaze at anything and in order to save creatures from destruction, I always cast my glance downwards.\\" On hearing the words of Lord Shani, Goddess Parvati laughed and all the damsels present also laughed. Goddess Parvati replied, \\"The entire universe moves according to the wishes of the Lord more than the moves of destiny. You look at me and my child.\\" Lord Shani was in a fix whether to look at the son of Parvati or not; he did not want to offend Goddess Parvati and at the same time did not want to cause any unintended harm. Finally so as not to offend Goddess Parvati, he looked only at Lord Ganesha and not the Goddess. His mind was disturbed and his throat, lips and palate were dried up. With the corner of the right eye, he glanced at the child’s face. At his gaze, the head of the child was cut-off and Lord Shani closed his eyes at once, looking downwards and stood there. The severed head of the child went to Golaka and entered the body of Lord Krishna. Goddess Parvati started lamenting and fainted. All the Gods and Goddesses panicked at this turn of events. Therefore, Lord Vishnu mounted on Garuda, went on the northern direction and reached the bank of the Puspabhadra river. There he found the elephant of Indra, who was all powerful virtue of the flower given by Sage Durvasa. Lord Vishnu cut off the head of the elephant by using the Sudarsana-chakra. Lord Vishnu then brought the dead elephant to life and it was restored to Lord Indra. Lord Vishnu then lifted the elephant head which had been cut off and had special powers. He came back and joined the trunk of the elephant to the body of Lord Ganesha using his divine knowledge and brought the child back to life. Understanding the story The Brahmavaivarat Purana states that Lord Ganesha is an ansh (manifestation) of the supreme consciousness. It was destined for an ansh to manifest as remover of obstacles for men and Gods, and become the God of intellect and wisdom. When we read the Purana, we are amazed at how all incidents in the past come together and lead towards a chosen destiny. The flower was presented to Indra by Sage Durvasa but not utilized by the King of Gods. The elephant temporarily benefited from the powers of the Parijata flower, but it was Lord Ganesha who was destined to be the foremost among Gods and men and known as the remover of obstacles. Thus destiny worked in a way that the attributes of the flower accumulated by the austerities of Sage Durvasa came to Lord Ganesha and that is the reason he has an elephant head.

Production and development About the show, Kyle Killen says \\"It’s a weird workplace drama that’s set around this idea that we’ve conducted 60 years worth of research into the science of human behavior and manipulation. So this is a one-of-a-kind company that is trying to turn all that research into a weekly “Wag the Dog” kind of problem-solving company.\\" He also said \\"I was just genuinely excited by the science and way these observations about human nature and the ways we're influenced without knowing it were coming out of the lab and being used to shape real world outcomes. It's an incredible amount of fun\\" He reiterated his enthusiasm during the Television Critics Association press tour saying \\"In terms of the likability of the characters, these are brothers who would like to connect and help people... [...] It certainly started with the idea of a moral grey area, but this has mainstream [appeal].\\" The show was originally titled Influence. Although there is a human behavior consulting firm in Chicago, TGG Group, the show is not based on this firm. The show's initial episode order was filmed in Chicago at a record-setting time when Chicago had six television shows (Mind Games, Betrayal, Crisis, Chicago PD, the returning Chicago Fire, and Sirens) as well as three major motion pictures (Transformers: Age of Extinction, Jupiter Ascending, and Divergent) that were all filming simultaneously. Killen is joined by Keith Redman as an executive producer. The show was a 20th Century Fox Television production. In May 2013, the show was announced as part of the 2013–14 schedule with Christian Slater and Steve Zahn as the stars. Megalyn Echikunwoke, Cedric Sanders, Gregory Marcel and Wynn Everett were announced as part of the supporting cast at that time. In August, Jaime Ray Newman was added to the cast. On March 27, 2014, after five episodes were aired, the show was canceled due to low ratings. According to IMDb, the remaining episodes aired in Japan, starting on July 15, 2014. The remaining episodes also aired in the UK. For US residents, the remaining episodes can be purchased through Amazon streaming. Episodes Reception TV Equals' P. T. Jackson viewed the show as appealing because it was a program \\"with characters that think outside the box but have hearts of gold and help people\\". He likened the show to Franklin & Bash for its outrageous quirkiness. Zap2it's Laurel Brown said that the characters' life histories \\"help them get inside the human mind better than anyone else\\". The show was also described as having similarities to Leverage. TV.com's Tim Surette called it the second most anticipated new show for midseason 2014, saying, \\"This could be the fun, underdog drama that ABC has been searching for. After the pilot's airing he said, \\"When compared to Killen's past work, Mind Games doesn't hold up in terms of ambition and risk.

She was built by Schichau in Elbing, Germany. Initially ordered by the Fujian Fleet, the ship was launched in 1886 and was China's largest torpedo boat at that point. The vessel saw service during the First Sino-Japanese War in the Battle of the Yalu River, and later at the Battle of Weihaiwei, where she was captured by the Japanese. The torpedo boat was taken into service by the Imperial Japanese Navy as Fukuryū (Japanese reading of 福龍) and remained active until sold for scrap in 1908. Design The Imperial Chinese Navy invested heavily in torpedo boats towards the end of the 19th century, with some 43 listed at the time of the First Sino-Japanese War. These have subsequently been organised into alphabetical classes, with Fulong being the sole boat of the Type H class, and the largest boat ordered so far. She was built by Schichau at their shipyard in Elbing, Germany. Fulong measured long overall, with a beam of and an average draft of which increased to at full load. The hull was constructed out of steel, with the ship equipped with a single funnel and two conning towers. Her main armament was three torpedo tubes. Two of them were located in torpedo rooms on both sides of the bows. The third one was on the truck which was located on the stern. There were Schwartzkopff torpedoes in store. Sources conflict as to whether a third tube was present, but reports of three torpedoes being fired in rapid succession at the Battle of Weihaiwei indicates that a third tube was present. There was a secondary armament of two guns. Fulong had a complement of 20 officers and men. She had a coal-fired reciprocating engine, with a single boiler and shaft. This produced , which enabled the vessel to reach a speed of . Service history Chinese service She left for China in June 1886, sailing from Germany to Foochow (now Fuzhou), China, under her own power and was assigned to the Beiyang Fleet. Fulong was involved in two battles of the First Sino-Japanese War. At the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894, Fulong arrived as part of a relief force for the Chinese forces, alongside the gunboats and , and fellow torpedo boat . They approached to the north of the engaged Chinese and Japanese fleets, preventing a flying wing of Japanese ships from encircling the opposition fleet. The group remained together, with the Japanese forces attempting to avoid them, instead targeting the ships of the main force. The group engaged the rear of the Japanese fleet, with Fulong firing three torpedoes at the converted merchantman Saikyo Maru, including one which passed under the ship. Saikyo Maru was carrying the Admiral of the Japanese fleet, Kabayama Sukenori. After several hours of battle, with dusk approaching, the Japanese fleet turned their main attention to Pingyuan and her escorts, but as darkness fell, the Japanese withdrew due to the risk of torpedo attack from Fulong and Zuo 1 with no torpedo boats of their own able to act in defence. The combined Chinese fleet sailed into Port Arthur to assess the damage inflicted. At the start of the following year, Fulong under the command of Captain Ts'ai T'in-kan, was among several ships at Weihai in the Battle of Weihaiwei. The Chinese fleet was blockaded in the harbour by the Japanese Combined Fleet, with night time raids by Japanese torpedo boats sinking and damaging Chinese vessels. No retaliatory attacks were ordered using the several Chinese torpedo boats in the harbour, and their first involvement in the battle was when they attempted to flee en masse through the Japanese blockade on 7 February. Several were sunk or captured with a total of 13 torpedo boats lost by China in this single engagement; Fulong is thought to have been one of two boats which were pursued by the Japanese cruisers and . It managed to beach itself at Chefoo (now Yantai), with the crew abandoning ship. Fulong was captured and towed by to the Japanese fleet by one of their torpedo boats during the following day. It remains in doubt whether the Chinese torpedo boats were ordered to flee by Admiral Ding Ruchang, the commanding officer of the ships at Weihaiwei. A memorial following the battle stated that those on the torpedo boats had run away from battle, and if any members of their crews were found, they should be summary decapitated. However, this command must not have been fully carried out, since Captain T'in-kan was promoted several years later to Vice-Admiral. Japanese service Fulong was renamed Fukuryū in Japanese service, and was one of several vessels captured during the First Sino-Japanese War inducted into the Imperial Japanese Navy. Prior to the Russo-Japanese War, she was included in the fifth torpedo boat division alongside three numbered boats. She was stricken from the Navy List in 1908, and subsequently broken up.

Administratively, Koregaon Bhima is under Shirur Taluka of Pune District in Maharashtra. There is only the single town of Koregaon Bhima in the Koregaon Bhima gram panchayat. The town of Koregaon Bhima is 10 km along the SH 60 motorway southwest of the village of Shikrapur, and 28 km by road northeast of the city of Pune. It is the site of the Battle of Koregaon fought on 1 January 1818. History The Battle of Koregaon took place on 1 January 1818 between the army of Peshwa Baji Rao II of Maratha Confederacy, and a small East India Company force that included native as well as British men. The Peshwa, whose 28,000-strong force encamped at the nearby Phulgaon, dispatched 20,000 of his soldiers to attack the 834-strong Company force. The Company troops successfully defended themselves against the attack, and the Peshwa withdrew at night fearing the arrival of a larger British force. After the British victory in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the Company commissioned a victory obelisk in Koregaon to commemorate its fallen soldiers. 22 of the 49 names of the slain soldiers on the pillar are that of Mahar caste. Today, the Mahars, who were formerly considered as untouchable, regard it as a symbol of their victory over the high-caste Peshwa, and gather in large numbers at the site on the anniversary of the battle. On January 1, 2018, when Dalits gathered in the nearby Vadhu Budruk to attend an event to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima Koregaon, there were violent clashes between Dalits and Marathas, resulting in the death of at least one person and injuries to several others. The main event at the victory memorial at Bhima Koregaon was largely peaceful but clashes were reported from neighbouring villages. Due to aggravation of violence, the Dalits of Maharashtra had declared a statewide bandh (shutdown) on 3 January 2018. The bandh turned violent, with the protesters forcibly shutting down establishments, blocking roads and vandalizing vehicles.  Demographics  In the 2001 census, the village of Koregaon Bhima had 8,999 inhabitants, with 5,178 males (57.5%) and 3,821 females (42.5%), for a gender ratio of 738 females per thousand males.

The spree culminated in a shootout with Alaska State Troopers in the Alaskan wilderness in which Silka was shot and killed. The motives for Silka's actions remain unclear. Early life Michael Silka grew up in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. From an early age, he had a love of firearms and the outdoors, and had a history of encounters with the law. In 1975, Silka and another juvenile were apprehended while trying to steal camping gear and weapons from a Des Plaines sporting goods store. That same year, Silka and his brother Steve ran away from high school to the Canadian wilderness, returning when they had depleted their provisions. In February 1977, four months before graduating from Hoffman Estates High School, Silka was arrested for carrying an antique black-powder muzzle-loading rifle — reminiscent of the weapons used by early mountain men — through a park in the suburb. He was arrested again for the same offenses later that year. Silka was convicted and paid a $100 fine. Shortly thereafter, Silka enlisted in the United States Army, at least partly on the advice of a longtime neighbor, Forman Hurst, who later recalled him as \\"a good kid, a typical teenager. He loved the outdoors. That was his No. 1 ambition, to be outside exploring nature.\\" In 1981, he was stationed at Fort Wainwright, located on the East side of Fairbanks, Alaska, until his discharge the same year. Army records show that Silka was rated an expert marksman with the M16 rifle and grenade launcher while in basic training. However, his stay at Fort Wainwright was marked by several run-ins with military police, including an assault charge and an arrest for discharging a firearm in a barracks. After his discharge from the Army, Silka returned to Hoffman Estates and worked at a number of jobs, mostly in construction work. In November 1982, he was stopped for a minor traffic violation and the officer noticed four weapons — a .44 caliber revolver, a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol, and two knives — in his car. Silka was charged for weapons possession and with resisting arrest after he refused to exit the squad car after arriving at the station. He was convicted and spent four days in Cook County Jail. On July 21, 1983, Silka was arrested on another weapons violation after a South Barrington officer stopped him for speeding, and a .22-caliber rifle was found in the back seat. He made several court appearances, the last on October 26, but then he skipped bond and fled to Alaska. A warrant for his arrest was issued on December 20. According to his younger brother Frank, Silka had been working in Alaska for some time, although he did not know what job his brother held. Suspected murder of Roger Culp A bearded, 25-year-old drifter, Silka was first seen in Alaska in the Chena Ridge section of Fairbanks. On April 29, 1984, police had questioned Silka about fresh blood and a snow-covered mound at his cabin. At the time, the Alaska State Troopers were under the impression that they were investigating whether Silka himself had been killed. Troopers dropped the matter when Silka stuck his head out of his shack and explained that the blood was from a moose hide. However, Silka's neighbor, Roger Culp, had gone missing the day before. Witnesses reported that Silka and Culp went into Silka's cabin, and later heard as many as eight gunshots. Apparently, witnesses had not reported the incident immediately. When Troopers obtained the new information, they returned to the cabin on May 8 with a search warrant, but Silka was gone. Red spots on the ground, by this point free of snow, were found to be human blood. At this point, Silka was wanted for questioning in Culp's disappearance, but Troopers had no leads as to his whereabouts.Ronald Barri Flowers and H. Loraine Flowers (2004). Murders in the United States: Crimes, Killers and Victims of the Twentieth Century, p. 82 Manley Hot Springs Silka was next seen on Monday, May 14, 1984, at the end of a dirt road (Alaska Route 2) in Manley Hot Springs, a tiny mining town of 70 people located west of Fairbanks and deep in the interior of Alaska. He was driving a battered brown and white 1974 Dodge Monaco filled with camping equipment and an aluminum canoe mounted on the roof. Unseen by villagers among the equipment were guns and ammunition. According to one resident, Robert E. Lee, Silka told the villagers that he planned to settle in the area. Silka described himself to Lee as a \\"mountain man\\". The villagers were impressed by Silka's common sense of the wilderness and survival, as well as his marksmanship. He was often seen \\"hanging around\\" a boat landing on the Tanana River, only outside of town. Silka had set up a tent at the boat landing and was frequently seen paddling his canoe in the Tanana. Lee said that on Thursday, May 17 between 2 and 4 p.m., six villagers went to the boat landing, all of whom disappeared. The disappearances were not noted by the locals until the following day, at which point they contacted Alaska State Troopers in Fairbanks on Friday night. The wife of one of the missing men gave Troopers Silka's license plate number, and the police then checked and learned he was wanted for investigation of the murder of Culp. Two helicopters, three planes and the Troopers' Special Emergency Reaction Team were sent to Manley at 2 a.m. Saturday, May 19. At the boat landing, Troopers found blood, believed to be human, and used cartridge casings. A wide helicopter search for Silka along the Tanana began at 2 a.m. At this time of year in Alaska, it was still daylight, so the search proceeded without hindrance. By the late hours of the same day, Silka was found upstream about southeast of Manley in an unnamed tributary of the Zitziana River (which is itself a tributary of the Tanana), near his own canoe and a motorized boat belonging to one of his victims, Fred Burk. Troopers offered Silka a chance to surrender. Instead, he stepped from behind a tree and fired a Ruger .30-06-caliber rifle at one of the airborne helicopters, penetrating the windshield and striking 34-year-old Trooper Troy L. Duncan of Fairbanks in the head, killing him instantly, and injuring Captain Donald Lawrence in the face. Trooper Jeff Hall returned fire with an M16 rifle, firing a burst on automatic from a moving helicopter. Five shots struck Silka and killed him. Troopers at the shootout said it was reminiscent of combat in the Vietnam War. A memorial service for the victims was held at the boat landing on Sunday, May 20. Silka was cremated and his ashes were buried in the Sitka National Cemetery in Alaska at his father's request. By June 23, 1984, four of the bodies — those of Burk, Lyman Klein, Dale Madajski and Larry Joe McVey — had been recovered from the Tanana River. Burk's body was discovered by his wife, Liller, about downstream from the scene of the killings. For months, families and friends of the victims searched the brush choked banks of the Tanana. Troopers believe that Silka had been in Alaska about a month. It is believed that he dumped the bodies of his victims into the Tanana in the hopes that they would not be found. The Tanana is as much as a mile wide and deep, and as the water remains near freezing temperatures, the glacier-fed river is heavily silted, and bodies are likely to remain below the surface. The motives for Silka's actions remain unclear. Victims *Fred Burk (also spelled Burke), 30, an Athabaskan Alaska Native homesteader,Kleinfield, Judith.

In retaliation the demonstrators attacked and set fire to a police station, killing all of its occupants. The incident led to the deaths of three civilians and 22 policemen. Mahatma Gandhi, who was strictly against violence, halted the non-co-operation movement on the national level on 12 February 1922, as a direct result of this incident. Background In the early 1920s, Indians, led by Mahatma Gandhi, were engaged in a nationwide non-cooperation movement. Using non-violent methods of civil disobedience known as Satyagraha protests were organised by the Indian National Congress to challenge oppressive government regulatory measures such as the Rowlatt Act, with the ultimate goal of swaraj or independence. The incident Two days before the incident, on 2 February 1922, volunteers participating in the Non-co-operation Movement led by a retired Army soldier named Bhagwan Ahir, protested against high food prices and liquor sale in the marketplace. The demonstrators were beaten back by the local police. Several of the leaders were arrested and put in the lock-up at the Chauri Chaura police station. In response to this, a protest against the police was called on 4 February, to be held at the local marketplace.Event, Metaphor, Memory – Chauri Chaura 1922–92 by Shahid Amin On 4 February, approximately 2,000 to 2,500 protesters assembled and began marching towards the market at Chauri Chaura. They had gathered to picket a liquor shop in the market place. Their leader was arrested, beaten and put in jail. Part of the crowd gathered in front of the local police station shouting slogans demanding the release of their leader. Armed police were dispatched to control the situation while the crowd marched towards the market and started shouting anti-government slogans. In an attempt to frighten and disperse the crowd, the police fired warning shots into the air. This only agitated the crowd who began to throw stones at the police. With the situation getting out of control, the Indian sub-inspector in charge ordered the police to open fire on the advancing crowd, killing three and wounding several others. Reports vary on the reason for the police retreat, with some suggesting that the constables ran out of ammunition while others claimed that the crowd's unexpectedly assertive reaction to the gunfire was the cause. In the ensuing chaos, the heavily outnumbered police fell back to the shelter of the police chowki while the angry mob advanced. Infuriated by the gunfire into their ranks, the crowd set the chowki ablaze, killing all of the Indian policemen and chaprassis (official messengers) trapped inside. Most were burned to death though several appear to have been killed by the crowd at the entrance to the chowki and their bodies thrown back into the fire. The death count is reported variously in the literature as 22 or 23 policemen killed, possibly due to the subsequent death of an additional burn victim. Aftermath  In response to the killing of the police, British authorities declared martial law in and around Chauri Chaura. Several raids were conducted and hundreds of people were arrested. Appalled at the outrage, Gandhi went on a five-day fast as penance for what he perceived as his culpability in the bloodshed. In reflection, Gandhi felt that he had acted too hastily in encouraging people to revolt against the British Raj without sufficiently emphasising the importance of ahinsa (non-violence) and without adequately training the people to exercise restraint in the face of attack. He decided that the Indian people were ill-prepared and not yet ready to do what was needed to achieve independence. Gandhi was also arrested and sentenced to six years of imprisonment but was later released in February 1924, on grounds of his ill health. On 12 February 1922, the Indian National Congress halted the Non-co-operation Movement on the national level as a direct result of the Chauri Chaura tragedy.Batsha, \\"Gandhi and Chauri Chaura,\\" Nehru and most of the workers of the Congress, who were in prison when Gandhi took this decision, felt that this was a hasty and incorrect decision at a time when the nation was finally uniting and rising up to the might of the British government in India. A few months after this withdrawal, the government arrested Gandhi and put him in jail.

It stands beside the Mutual Store building on the corner of Flinders and Degraves Streets, opposite Flinders Street station. The Empire Building and Mutual Store were redeveloped into a residential complex, completed in 2006.  History  Originally known as the Empire Arcade, the building was designed by Nahum Barnet and constructed in 1906. It housed a variety of different uses, with a dead-end retail arcade at ground level and 'rooms' above, accommodating over the years the usual array of specialist uses found in city buildings such as a cafe on the first floor, a ladies training college, a dressmaker, a tailor, a poultry specialist, and a meeting room for hire. The Empire Arcade was nearly gutted by a spectacular fire in 1923, resulting in losses exceeding at £70,000 but it was quickly rebuilt in the following years. In 1955 it was purchased by the adjacent Mutual Store, and underwent a range of modifications. These included absorbing the arcade space, creation of entries through the party wall, the reconfiguration of entries and internal circulation, and the addition of a modern canopy. In 1965, the store closed and the two buildings became the city home of the College of Advanced Education for 40 years.http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01036b.htm The Mutual Store and the Empire Building were redeveloped by the developer Baycrown and architects ClarkeHopkinsClarke, beginning in 2001. The redevelopment was finished in 2006. Designed by ClarkeHopkinsClarke Architects, a small front section of the Empire Building was retained, and a 14 storey tower added behind. Retail spaces still take up the entirety of the ground floor, albeit no longer in an arcade format. The rest of the project is given over to small to medium-sized apartments. Because of the poor state of the building’s façade, the developer contracted a specialist firm to rebuild the mouldings, urns, and other features, and the original sandy yellow colour of the building was painted over in grey. This redevelopment required the balancing of heritage guidelines, commercial imperatives and the City of Melbourne Planning Scheme. Council required the retention of the street canopies to Flinders Street to provide continuous street shelter for pedestrians and to create an active edge to both Flinders and Degraves Street.  Architecture  Barnet was a flexible architect who built in many different styles over his long career, or indeed at any given time. Built in the Edwardian Period, the Empire Building is a good example of Federation architecture in a broadly Federation Free Classical style, with other influences. Some of the classical elements could be described as Edwardian Baroque, such as the exaggerated voussoir around the central arched window, which continue as rustication to the whole first floor, and the pair of arched broken pediments on the parapet, while the Ionic colonnade shows the then emerging influence of the Neo-Classical. The shape of the main window suggests a Romanesque influence to Barnet's overall eclectic but delightful design.

Originating from an area of low pressure over the southern Bay of Bengal in early May 2013, Viyaru slowly consolidated into a depression on May 10\\\\. The depression gained forward momentum and attained gale-force winds on May 11 and was designated as Cyclonic Storm Viyaru, the first named storm of the season. Owing to adverse atmospheric conditions, the depression struggled to maintain organized convection as it moved closer to eastern India. On May 14, the exposed circulation of Viyaru turned northeastward. The following day, conditions again allowed for the storm to intensify. Early on May 16, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). Shortly thereafter Viyaru made landfall near Chittagong, Bangladesh. On May 17, it moved over the eastern Indian state of Nagaland. Early in the storm's existence, it brought flooding rains to much of northwestern Indonesia, resulting in significant damage. At least four people died and six others were reported missing. Offshore, a further 11 people went missing and were feared dead. In preparation for the storm, large-scale evacuations were recommended for parts of Myanmar. This resulted with people overcrowding boats to escape, and one or several vessels capsized, causing at least 39 deaths; 42 people were rescued while 19 others were unaccounted for and feared dead. The storm's expansive cloud mass also brought unsettled weather to Sri Lanka, Thailand, and southeastern India. Severe storms in India and Sri Lanka were responsible for at least 16 fatalities and significant damage; one person died in Thailand. Striking Bangladesh in a weaker state than initially expected, the storm caused moderate to severe damage. A total of 95,003 poorly constructed huts were damaged or destroyed, 17 people died, and nearly 1.3 million were affected across the country. Losses to crops reached ৳2.75 billion (US$35.3 million). Myanmar was spared damage and further casualties. Operationally, the storm was referred to as Mahasen; however, this stirred some controversy from nationalists and officials in Sri Lanka. They claimed that the name comes from King Mahasena of Anuradhapura who brought prosperity to the island, thus naming a destructive force of nature after him would be improper. As such, Sri Lankan agencies referred to the system as a nameless cyclone and requested that international agencies do the same. The name had been submitted to be used in the basin by Sri Lanka in 2003. The India Meteorological Department later renamed the system as Viyaru in their final reports and removed Mahasen from all previous archived advisories. Meteorological history In early May 2013, an area of disturbed weather formed over the southern Bay of Bengal. Remaining nearly stationary, the system gradually developed. By May 8, organized convection formed around a defined low pressure area, with banding features present. With conditions favoring intensification, low wind shear, excellent poleward outflow, and unusually high sea surface temperatures (estimated at ), the system was anticipated to become a tropical cyclone over the following days. A pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation, coupled with a convective Kelvin wave allowed the system, along with its Southern Hemisphere counterpart Tropical Storm Jamala, to further develop. Following additional organization, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the low on May 10. Despite an increase in wind shear, causing the low to become dislocated from the deepest convection, the system further intensified and a scatterometer pass from the Oceansat-2 satellite indicated winds up to . In light of this data, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 01B while it was situated roughly south of Chittagong, Bangladesh. At the time, the agency anticipated significant strengthening of the cyclone, forecasting it to attain winds in excess of 155 km/h (100 mph). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) followed suit hours later, designating the system as Depression BOB 01 and soon upgrading it to a deep depression. Viyaru (top) as a depression off the coast of Sumatra, along with Moderate Tropical Storm Jamala to its south, on May 10 Situated to the south of a subtropical ridge, the storm tracked west-northwestward to northwestward. Early on May 11, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm and assigned it the name Mahasen. Deep convection, with cloud tops estimated as cold as developed near the storm's center. Despite moderate to strong wind shear, Viyaru's prominent outflow offset the negative influence of the shear, allowing a central dense overcast to form. Later that day, the cyclone's motion matched that of the shear, further decreasing the effects of it. This allowed Viyaru to intensify, with the JTWC estimating one-minute sustained winds reaching 95 km/h (60 mph). By May 12, the central dense overcast broke apart into fragmented banding features that wrapped into the center. Dry air soon began to flow into the circulation, disrupting convection and causing the low to relocate eastward and become partially exposed. Later that day, the system began turning northward as it approached the western edge of the subtropical ridge. By this time, the circulation had become broad and ill-defined, indicating that the storm weakened. On May 13, steering currents weakened around the cyclone due to a shortwave trough over India, causing Viyaru to slowly move northwestward. Wind shear also increased once again as the outflow degraded. By May 14, the exposed and elongated circulation of Viyaru turned northeastward as the ridge became more pronounced. The majority of convection remained sheared to the west, though upper-level conditions were anticipated to become somewhat favorable for restrengthening. As the system approached Bangladesh, a large area convection and rebuilt over the center. Slight strengthening took place on May 15, with the IMD reporting winds reaching 85 km/h (50 mph). Viyaru also began to accelerate somewhat as a trough became established to the west. Early on May 16, the system attained its peak intensity with a barometric pressure estimated at 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). Around 0800 UTC (1330 IST), Viyaru made landfall in Bangladesh between Feni and Chittagong. Within hours of moving ashore, rapid weakening ensued as the circulation deteriorated and convection became shallow. In light of this, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone. The IMD downgraded Viyaru to a deep depression shortly after as it moved over Mizoram, India. The system further degraded as it moved over mountainous terrain and was last noted as a well-marked area of low pressure over Nagaland on May 17. Preparations and impact Early in the storm's life, it affected parts of northwestern Indonesia. In Aceh, five days of heavy rain triggered flash flooding that forced thousands to evacuate. One person died in Simeulue Regency after being struck by a fallen tree and another went missing offshore when his motorboat sank. Twenty-two fishermen were reported missing on May 9 after sailing into the storm; however, ten were soon rescued. Another was found in a nearby town by May 18 while the remaining eleven were feared dead. Much of Aceh experienced torrential rains and flooding occurred in six districts. In some places, waters reached depths of . Approximately 30,000 people were affected by the floods. Near the border of Aceh and North Sumatra, a landslide struck a bus with eight people in it and sent it into the nearby Laekombi Lake. Three bodies were recovered away from where the accident took place while the other five remained missing. Heavy rains from the cyclone's outer bands caused significant flooding in Sri Lanka. As much as of precipitation fell in Ratnapura while was reported in Kurunegala. Water flows on the island's rivers reached 106 million cubic meters; however, hydroelectric dams constructed on the rivers prevented this flow from flooding areas downstream. Instead, this water served to raise the electricity storage from , 52.6 to 63.1 percent of capacity. At least eight people died while two to three others were reported missing. A total of 7,339 people were affected by the storm, of which 3,861 were rendered homeless. Farther west, severe storms in Andhra Pradesh, India caused eight deaths and injured four others; all of the casualties were the result of lightning. Heavy rains from the storms also flooded 739 hectares (1,800 acres) of crops and drowned 23 livestock. The system also brought a hot airmass to parts of southeastern India, with Chennai recording temperatures as high as . On May 13, coastal districts of Odisha were placed on alert for heavy rains and gusty winds associated with the passage of the cyclone. Across the state, the storm brought scattered strong storms, producing winds up to in Balasore, and much needed relief to an ongoing heat wave. The heaviest rains fell in Malkangiri where was measured. Western parts of the state experienced a significant drop in temperatures after reaching prior to the cyclone. Schools in Manipur and Mizoram had a half day on May 16 and remained closed the following day. The Government of Assam was also on alert for possible effects from the storm. Large swells and high winds extending from the storm impacted the west coast of Thailand. Storms associated with the cyclone also caused significant damage in Nakhon Sawan province, resulting in one death. Three homes were destroyed and twenty others were damaged in the province. Bangladesh Viyaru making landfall in Feni, Bangladesh on May 16 On May 13, the Government of Bangladesh raised the nation's storm alert to level seven (on a ten-level scale). Resources towards food stockpiles were allocated, with plans for of rice to be prepared. All public buildings and some private, such as hotels, were to be treated as evacuation centers. The Bangladeshi armed forces and air force were placed on stand-by for rescue and relief missions following the storm. By May 15, 3,770 shelters were opened to house evacuees across the country. The nation's disaster management agency also allocated ৳300,000 (US$3,800) in funds, 5,000 tents, and 7,000 sari and lungi. Roughly 50,000 volunteers were placed on alert. The country's second-largest city, Chittagong, was brought to a stand-still and airports were shut down. Approximately 1 million people sought refuge in shelters, roughly 600,000 of whom lived around Chittagong. There were also concerns over the safety of 230,000 Rohingyan refugees (following Myanmar's deadly riots in 2012) who do not have sufficient shelter. Satellite-estimated rainfall totals across the Bay of Bengal from May 6 to 16 derived from NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. Areas in purple, seen along the Bangladesh–Myanmar border, indicate amounts in excess of ; the highest estimated value was . On May 16, Viyaru struck southern Bangladesh, bringing heavy rains and winds up to 95 km/h (60 mph). Though the storm was weaker than anticipated, rains over the country preceding the cyclone led to concerns of widespread flooding. In some areas, more than a month's worth of rain fell over two weeks. Rains amounted to in parts of the Patuakhali District while of rain fell in Chittagong during Viyaru's passage. Low-lying coastal areas were flooded by a storm surge; however, low tide lessened the impact of the surge. Damage in these regions was less than initially feared. Tidal flooding affected 70 villages in the Cox's Bazar District. Along the Meghna River, 30 villages became submerged in flood waters. Government assessments revealed that 49,178 homes were totally destroyed while another 45,825 were damaged. Tens of thousands of trees were downed, causing travel disruptions. At least 17 people were killed across the country, all of whom were in the southwestern coastal areas. Thousands of people were also injured and many livestock were killed. The most severe damage and greatest loss of life took place in the Barguna District. Approximately 15,000 mud-built homes sustained damage in the Noakhali district. In the Patuakhali District, at least 100 huts were destroyed. Severe damage to agriculture also took place, with many standing crops flattened by gale-force winds. Roughly 128,000 hectares (316,300 acres) of crops in Patuakhali were damaged, roughly half of which was for sweet potato. Agricultural losses in the country amounted to ৳2.75 billion (US$35.3 million). A total of 1,285,508 people were affected by the storm throughout the country. The relatively low death toll was seen as a great success of Bangladesh's disaster preparedness, with the International Organization for Migration stating, \\"if this same storm had hit 20 years ago, we might have seen thousands of deaths.\\" Relief efforts began shortly after the storm's passage. The Bangladeshi government allocated US$13 million and of rice for victims. Families in remote areas were provided with ৳3,000 (US$38) and of rice. The disaster management agency mobilized 100 water treatment facilities. Aerial assessments of damage revealed only localized areas of significant impact. No disaster declaration was made in the storm's wake and the government did not request international assistance. On May 17, Christian Aid released £100,000 (US$153,700) in emergency funds to partner organizations working in Bangladesh. The following day, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies began a three-month relief operation to provide assistance to 20,000 people in the hard-hit districts of Patuakhali, Barguna, and Bhola. Myanmar In Myanmar, the United Nations urged that approximately 70,000 people evacuate in preparation for the cyclone. This prompted widespread evacuations in the country. Off the coast of Rakhine State, a large boat was towing two smaller ones to a safer area, late on May 13, when one or more of them capsized after striking rocks. Authorities believed there were 100-150 people total aboard the three vessels. By the following day, 42 people had been rescued and 8 bodies had been found. On May 16, members of the Bangladeshi border guard recovered 31 bodies in Teknaf Upazila from those who drowned in the accident. By May 14, the government planned to have 38,000 people evacuated; however, this process was reportedly moving slower than expected. With the majority of evacuees being internally displaced persons, many were hesitant to listen to orders from the military, and some refused to leave their temporary shelters. By May 15, the number of displaced persons urged to evacuate rose to 140,000, with many still refusing to leave. Some told reporters that they would not listen to anything the government said unless they pointed guns at them. In Arakan State, just outside Sittwe, 393 people were evacuated from low-lying areas. Field offices of the Save the Children foundation were placed on high alert. Sessions on how to prepare for cyclones were held across Rakhine State. Ultimately, nearly 70,000 people were evacuated in Rakhine State prior to Viyaru's arrival. Because the storm took a more westerly track than anticipated, Myanmar was spared much impact from the cyclone. The storm's effects were limited to some rain and waves in northwestern areas, with waves reported in Maungdaw Township. In Sittwe, Mercy Malaysia mobile clinics reported that 90 people sought treatment. Had the storm maintained a more easterly track, officials believed that the Rohingyan people's refusal to evacuate would have resulted in many deaths.

The flowers are white to yellowish. A short stalk bears up to 11 legume fruit pods which are linear in shape, dark red to blackish in color, and up to 8.5 or 9 centimeters long. They dehisce along each edge to release up to 26 to 30 seeds each. Flowers and fruits are produced year-round in tropical locales with enough water. Outside the tropics it reproduces mainly in spring and summer. Habitat and range This plant grows in open habitat types. It easily colonizes disturbed habitat such as roadsides and quarries. It grows in clay and sandy soil types. It is most common at lower altitudes. Its habit of dying back to the root crown helps it to withstand drought, frost, fire, and grazing. It resprouts when conditions are less harsh. It cannot tolerate shade, however, and it does not thrive under a tree canopy. This species is native to the southern United States, parts of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean and has been introduced outside its native range purposely and accidentally. In the United States it is considered to be native to Texas, but it also grows in Florida, where it may or may not be native. It was first reported in Louisiana in 2011 when it was discovered sprouting in a vacant lot in Shreveport. It is naturalized in several African countries, such as Senegal, Zambia, and South Africa, as well as Pacific Islands such as New Caledonia and Hawaii, plus Indonesia, the Philippines, India, and Australia. It is considered to be a weed in many places.Desmanthus virgatus. HEAR Global Compendium of Weeds. Uses Prostrate bundleflower is palatable to livestock and non-toxic, and it contains ample protein.

Slate's first recording was her LP Half Full, self-released when she was 16. As a teenager Slate wrote songs and worked in coffeehouses in her hometown Toronto. In 1999 she performed at the Canadian Music Week, which led to a deal with Management Trust, Ltd. She had a side-stage performance at the Lilith Fair in Toronto in August 1999 and performed again at the Canadian Music Week in 2000. Slate later signed with Hollywood Records and began working on her album Edge of a Girl with Rob Cavallo. Edge of a Girl was released in September 2003, \\"accompanied by a strong online push for the single Bad Girl.\\" Allmusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, stating \\"When her rich, sultry vocals aren't losing ground against the onslaught of busy, scratchy, heard-it- all-before production, Slate is able to convey some real emotion\\". Allmusic however criticised the album for its similarities to Lucy Woodwards music released at the same time. Stylus Magazine gave a favourable review, calling the album \\"pretty good, lots of angst-rock in the Lillix model with vocals closer to Aimee Mann\\". Stylus stated the record achieved poor sales in the absence of a concentrated PR push, and added that had it been released a year later it may have been more successful, as by that time Hollywood Records were promoting most of their new artists on Radio Disney. Her first single from the album, Bad Girl, was featured on the Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life soundtrack, also being one of several songs to appear in the films closing credits.

It premiered on Fox on July 21, 2013, as a part of the channel's Animation Domination HD programming block. The first season consisted of 12 11-minute episodes. The second, broadcast in April—June 2015 on FXX consisted of 10 episodes.http://axecop.com/comic/5-years-later/ Plot Similar to the webcomic, the series features the eponymous police officer, his partner Flute Cop, and their allies Sockarang, Gray Diamond, Liborg, Bat Warthog Man, and Wexter as they fight various \\"bad guys\\" and avoid getting into conflict with the Normal Police. Development Axe Cop is a popular webcomic that was created by Ethan Nicolle and his young brother Malachai (five years old at the time of its creation). In playing with Malachai, Ethan found that his brother had a vivid and disjointed imagination, and developed the comic by taking the stories that Malachai told, refining the story to some point without losing Malachai's inventiveness, and drawing the comic around it. The webcomic became very popular, leading to publishing deals with Dark Horse Comics for larger comic-book-sized stories. The development of the Axe Cop series started from a conversation that Nick Offerman had with the ADHD producer Nick Weidenfeld some years before the program's debut. Offerman talked with Weidenfeld about the Axe Cop comic and stated that if a show was to be made from it, Offerman wanted to participate. Weidenfeld took the idea to Phil Lord and Chris Miller, also fans of the webcomic, and they asked Weidenfeld to lead the project, stating that it \\"has to be emotional\\", in Weidenfeld's words. As Lord and Miller were working on 21 Jump Street at the time, they suggested Weidenfeld turn to Judah Miller for directional help. Weidenfeld and Miller arranged for a retreat along with writers and creators of Drawn Together Dave Jeser & Matt Silverstein, voice actors Ken Marino, Patton Oswalt, and Offerman, and the comic creator Ethan Nicolle, where the group discussed their favorite parts of the comic and how to translate it into a show, keeping all the moments that are \\"100-percent pure Malachai\\". As they started to write some of the show's plots, they found themselves with narrative dead ends; Ethan used these moments to contact Malachai, explain the story so far and have Malachai provide the missing narrative. Malachai also provided additional advice during the animation process for the shorts when he visited the studios, such as insisting that Zombie Island be set in space, a tangent that the writers and animators quickly agreed with for its illogical humorous value and included in the short. Episodes Season 1 (2013) The initial episode order for the series was six. On August 1, 2013, Fox ordered six additional episodes, bringing the season to a total of 12 episodes.

The bodies of several scale insect species produce a crimson dye that in medieval times was commercially valuable for dyeing textiles. Medieval Arabic dictionaries say al-qirmiz is an \\"Armenian red dye\\",A number of large dictionaries were written in Arabic during medieval times. Searchable copies of nearly all of the main medieval Arabic dictionaries are online at Baheth.info and/or AlWaraq.net. One of the most esteemed of the dictionaries is Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari's \\"Al-Sihah\\" which is dated around and shortly after year 1000. The biggest is Ibn Manzur's \\"Lisan Al-Arab\\" which is dated 1290 but most of its contents were taken from a variety of earlier sources, including 9th- and 10th-century sources. Often Ibn Manzur names his source then quotes from it. Therefore, if the reader recognizes the name of Ibn Manzur's source, a date considerably earlier than 1290 can often be assigned to what is said. A list giving the year of death of a number of individuals who Ibn Manzur quotes from is in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, volume 1, page xxx (year 1863). Lane's Arabic- English Lexicon contains much of the main contents of the medieval Arabic dictionaries in English translation. At AlWaraq.net, in addition to searchable copies of medieval Arabic dictionaries, there are searchable copies of a large number of medieval Arabic texts on various subjects. which means dye from the Armenian cochineal insects of today's English, which are distinct from the Kermes insects. The word was in use in Arabic for centuries before it started to be used in European languages, and was adopted in Europe beginning in the late 13th century, in Italy, with the same meaning as the Arabic. In Europe the meaning began to be narrowed to today's Kermes species in scientific botany and taxonomy works of the mid 16th century.A number of distinct scale- insect species yield comparable but distinct red dyes. Kermes in English today refers to one of these, but the medieval Arabic name qirmiz usually referred to a different one of these -- the one now called in English \\"Armenian cochineal\\", obtained from insects of the genus Porphyrophora (different from the genus Kermes). Some examples of medieval Arabic writers who mention al- qirmiz and whose works are online in Arabic in text-searchable format at AlWaraq.net: Ibn Duraid (died 933), Ibn Abd Rabbih (died 940), Al-Istakhri (died c. 957), Al-Biruni (died 1048), Ibn Sida (died 1066). Additional medieval history is in \\"The Insect Dyes of Western and West-Central Asia\\", by R.A. Donkin, year 1977, 33 pages. In the later medieval centuries in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Latin, today's Kermes dye was usually called grain or grana  granum. Kermes-like red dyes, including Armenian cochineal and Polish cochineal, were called in late medieval Italian chermisi  cremisi, which begot late medieval Latin chermes  kermes. The Latin and Italian spelling che- was pronounced KE-. One of the earliest scientific writers in Europe to use the Latin word chermes in the specifically restricted sense of today's Kermes was Pietro Andrea Mattioli in the 1540s (example in Latin). The word-form kermes entered English and French in the 16th century from the Italian-Latin chermes.

The technical chemistry names cathine and cathinone are 20th century from Catha. ;kohl (cosmetics) : كحل kohl, finely powdered galena, stibnite, and similar sooty-colored powder used for eye-shadow, eye-liner, and mascara. The word with that meaning was in many travellers' reports in English, from travellers in Arabic lands, for centuries before it was adopted natively in English.English traveller in the Middle East year 1615: \\"They put between the eyelids and the eye a certain black powder with a fine long pencil, made of a mineral called alcohole, which... do better set forth the whiteness of the eye.\\" – ref. Similar travellers' reports in English are in ref: Algeria 1738, ref: Yemen 1794, and ref: Egypt 1877. Crossref alcohol which was transferred from the same Arabic word at an earlier time by a different pathway. L ;lacquer, lac : لكّ lakk, lac. The Arabic came from the Sanskrit lākh = \\"lac\\", a particular kind of resin, native in India, used to make a varnish and also used as a red colorant. Lac was valued foremostly as a red colorant in the medieval era. The medieval Arabs imported lac from India. The word entered medieval Latin as lacca  laca in the early 9th century, although instances are scarce in Latin before the 12th century. It is found late medievally in all of the Western Latinate languages.A servant of Ibn Badis (died 1062) used لكّ lakk  lukk = \\"lac\\" as an ingredient in making red ink, where it acted as a binder and as a red tincture – ref (pages 19 and 23), ref (pages 30 and 32). Ibn Sina's Canon around year 1025 said lak was a resinous exudation from a plant – ref. Ibn Baklarish in his book Mustaʿīnī dated around year 1100 said lakk could refer to either the resin from a tree or the crimson colorant from the lac scale insect – Reinhart Dozy, year 1869. Dozy says the Arabs used lac foremostly as a red colorant. Simon of Genoa in the 1290s said in Latin: \\"Lacca is a red gum from which a dye is made.... The Arabs call it lech\\" – ref. The word is in Latin as lacca in the early 9th century in a book about making colorants, where the lacca is used as a coloring ingredient – namely this is the book Compositiones Variae, which survives today in a physical manuscript dated early 9th century as a physical manuscript – Compositiones Variae text; ref for its date. Lacca is similarly in Latin in the Mappae Clavicula, a book about making colorants dated during and before the 12th century. Today's Italian, Spanish & Portuguese lacca  laca meaning lac and lacquer go back to medieval dates in those languages. Spanish laca and Catalan laca have records at around 1250 – CORDE, Diccionari.cat. French lacque dates from about 1400 and French also has lac, lache, and lacca with late medieval dates meaning lac and lacquer – Dictionnaire du Moyen Français. The English lac and lacquer are given 16th- century start dates in English, but English has at least two 15th-century records in the form lacca in Latin-to-English medical translations – Middle English Dictionary. When the Europeans sailed to India in the 16th century, they met the word lākh spoken by the Indians meaning the lac resin, and they imported the lac directly from India to Europe. Since the word was already in Portuguese, Latin, French, and English before they sailed, it is incorrect or disputable to say (as some dictionaries do) that the word \\"lac\\" came to English directly from India. Compare American Heritage Dictionary against Random House Dictionary on this issue at Lac @ TheFreeDictionary.com. Two lesser-seen varnishing resins with Arabic word-descent are sandaracEuropeans got all their sandarac resin from the Arab lands, primarily from Morocco, and the Arabic word سندروس sandarūs is almost certainly the source for the European sandarac resin word. The 11th-century Arabic encyclopedia The Canon of Medicine by Ibn Sina uses the word sandarūs to mean a tree resin – ref: سندروس ... هو صمغ شجرة. A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1914) says: \\"New Latin sandaracha Arabum represents Arabic sandarus (Dozy, from P. de Alcalá 1505), also sandalus (Freytag, from Golius); but the Arabic word cannot be native Arabic\\" – ref: NED. Simon of Genoa in Latin in the late 13th century said sandaracha means arsenic sulfide, yellow or red but he added that in Arabic the word means varnishing resin – ref (in Latin). In the vernacular languages in the West the sandarac resin word appears to begin in the early to mid-16th century in Spanish and Italian (see Merrifield year 1849), from which it was borrowed a century later into English (ref: NED). Pedro de Alcala a.k.a. Petri Hispani (1505) said Spanish barnis (varnish) is sandaros in Arabic – ref. Andrés Laguna (died 1559) said Spanish grassa, \\"no different from juniper resin\\", is called \\"sandaraca\\" in Arabic – ref1, ref2 – which was not quite correct because the word in Arabic texts was sandarūs. The Arabic word sandarūs might have come down from ancient Greek sandaracha. The Greek word and also the classical and medieval Latin sandaraca meant red arsenic sulfide and red lead and it was employed as a red pigment. Sandarac resin has a light yellow color. Ibn Al-Baitar (died 1248) said sandarūs is a \\"yellow resin\\" – ref. But possibly the Arabic sandarūs might have started out referring to some other tree resin with a red color (see e.g.). In some of today's English dictionaries, the resin-word sandarac is derived from the medieval and classical Latin sandaraca (without Arabic intermediation) which is okay with regard to the word's form but not okay with regard to the semantics because the medieval Latin sandaraca was not a resin. and elemi.Two instances in medieval Arabic of اللامي al-lāmī meaning a resin are in Henri Lammens year 1890, page 288. The earliest known record in a European language is Latin gumi elemi composed about 1450 and published in 1488 in Compendium Aromatariorum by Saladinus of Ascoli in southeastern Italy – Ref. Another early record is gumi elimi in a medical book by Giovanni da Vigo in Rome in Latin in 1517 – ref: CNRTL.fr. These records can be taken to indicate that the word-transfer to Europe was through Italian sea merchants on the Mediterranean. The word was rare in Arabic both medievally and later. The elemi resin of the Arabs probably came from Ethiopia. One of Lammens' medieval Arabic sources said al-lāmī comes \\"from Yemen or from the Indies\\". But Yemen was likely just a waystation or transit-point for goods brought across the Indian Ocean at the time, and the goods transiting through Yemen from the Indian Ocean could come from Ethiopia as well as from the Indies. In Europe around 1700 it was said by Nicholas Lemery and others that \\"true\\" elemi comes from Ethiopia and Yemen and a different elemi comes from America – Ref, ref. During the 19th century the principal elemi in commerce in Europe was \\"Manila elemi\\", from a tree native in the Philippines – Ref. A derived chemical name is elemicin. ;lazurite (mineral) : See azure. ;lemon, limonene : ليمون līmūn, lemon. The cultivation of lemons, limes, and bitter oranges was introduced to the Mediterranean region by the Arabs in the mid-medieval era. The ancient Greeks & Romans knew the citron, but not the lemon, lime, or orange. Ibn al-'Awwam in the late 12th century distinguished ten kinds of citrus fruits grown in Andalusia and spelled the lemon as اللامون al-lāmūn. Abdallatif al- Baghdadi (died 1231) distinguished almost as many different citrus fruits in Egypt and spelled the lemon as الليمون al-līmūn.\\"Études sur les noms arabes des végétaux: l'oranger et ses congénères\\", by J.J. Clément-Mullet in Journal Asiatique sixième série Tome XV, pages 17 to 41, year 1870. The Arabic word came from Persian.In the Persian language in the mid 11th century the writer Nasir Khusraw used the Persian word for lemon, لیمو līmu – ref: Nasir Khusraw, section on Tripoli: in Persian, in English translation, pages 6-7. In Arabic the records for the word lemon are hard to find until the 12th century. A very early instance in Arabic is in a chapter about the geography of Pakistan in the geography book of Al-Istakhri (died about 957; lived in Iran; probably visited Pakistan personally). Al-Istakhri's book says: \\"the people of this land [Balād al-Sind = Pakistan] have a fruit the size of a small apple called al-līmūna, which is bitter, very acidic\\" – ref. The geography book of Ibn Hawqal (died c. 988) replicates the same statement – ref. The lemon tree's native origin appears to be in India.Origin of Cultivated Plants by Alphonse de Candolle (year 1885), pages 178–181 for lemon and lime. ;lime (fruit): ليم līm, meaning sometimes any citrus fruit, sometimes lemon and lime fruit, and sometimes a lime fruit. In Arabic līm was a back-formation from līmūn; see lemon. Medieval writers who used līm with the meaning of a lime fruit include Al-Qalqashandi (died 1414), Ibn Batuta (died 1369), and Ibn Khaldoun (died 1406).Al-Līm = \\"lime fruit\\" in Al-Qalqashandi's Subh al-aʿsha on pages 70, 141, 155 and 184 (in Arabic). Also in Ibn Batuta's Voyages, on pages 126 and 128 (in Arabic and French). Also Ibn Khaldoun's Prolegomena, aka مقدمة Muqaddima, on page 259 (in Arabic). In Spanish and Italian today lima means lime fruit. In bygone centuries in Spanish and Italian lima meant also lime- lemon varieties distinct from today's lime. Pedro de Alcala's Spanish-Arabic dictionary year 1505 translated the Spanish lima as Arabic lim. Today in English \\"lime\\" has become a color-name as well as a fruit. The color-name originated by reference to the fruit. It can be noted in passing that all the following English color-names are descended from Arabic words (not necessarily Arabic color-words): apricot (color), aubergine (color), azure (color), coffee (color), crimson (color), henna (color), lemon (color), lime (color), orange (color), saffron (color), tangerine (color). ;luffa : لوف lūf, luffa. Entered European botany nomenclature from Egypt in 1638.\\"Luffa\\" in Etymologisches Wörterbuch der botanischen Pflanzennamen, by Helmut Genaust year 1996. The first known occurrence of the plantname \\"Luffa\\" in a Western language is in the botanist Johann Veslingius, who visited Egypt in 1628 and afterwards published drawings and a description of the Luffa aegyptiaca plant. Veslingius wrote that the plant was in cultivation around Cairo, was called \\"Luff  Luffa\\" in Arabic, and was used both as an edible cucumber and as a scrubber. Veslingius called it Luffa Arabum and \\"Egyptian Cucumber\\" – De Plantis Aegyptiis, by Johann Veslingius, year 1638 page 48 (in Latin). In 1706 the botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort introduced the formal botany genus name \\"Luffa\\". He referred to Veslingius's earlier description and reiterated that Luffa Arabum is a plant from Egypt in the cucumber family – Tournefort year 1706 in French. In 1761 the botanist Peter Forsskål visited Egypt and noted that the luffa plant was called لوف lūf in Arabic – Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica, by Peter Forskal, year 1775, page LXXV (in Latin). In Arabic the name lūf has also designated some other plants unrelated to the luffa. In today's Arabic the luffa plant is more usually called ليف līf, which associates with the common Arabic word līf = \\"fiber\\" and alludes to the use of the luffa as a fibrous scrubber and not as a vegetable. The luffa is a tropical plant, native in Indochina, which was under cultivation with irrigation in Egypt at the time. The name has been in English botany books since the mid 18th century as Luffa. In the later 19th century it re-entered English in non-botanical discourse as \\"Loofah\\" referring to the luffa scrubbing sponge.English \\"loofah\\" in NED. ;lute : العود al-ʿaūd, the oud. Al-ʿaūd was one of the chief musical instruments of the Arabs throughout the medieval era.A History of Arabian Music to the 13th Century, by Henry George Farmer, year 1929, 230 pages. See ʿūd in the book's Page Index (the book's merit is as a collection into English of many short extracts from different medieval Arabic documents). Most medieval Arabic music-making involved human singing, and al-ʿaūd was usually a preferred supporting instrument. The European lute word, a word now in all European languages, has its earliest records in the mid 13th century in Catalan and Spanish. The early Catalan form was laut. Spanish has alod in 1254, alaut in about 1330, laud in 1343.More details at CNRTL.fr Etymologie in French language. Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales (CNRTL) is a division of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. \\"The Portuguese form :pt:Alaúde clearly shows the Arabic origin.\\"Reported in An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, by Walter W. Skeat, year 1888. Downloadable. Medievally the ʿaūd of the Arabs and the lute of the Latins were very nearly the same instrument and differed mainly in the musicians' playing style. The medieval Latins borrowed the instrument from the Arabs, as well as the name.\\"A Brief History of the Lute\\", Part One, by David van Edwards. Similarly, \\"A Brief Introduction to the Lute\\", by Christopher Goodwin of The Lute Society (UK). The earliest unambiguous record in English is in the 2nd half of the 14th century (Middle English Dictionary). M ;macramé : مقرمة miqrama, an embroidered cloth covering. Closely related is Arabic miqram = \\"decorated bedspread or tapestry\\".In addition to medieval Arabic dictionaries at Baheth.info, refer to مقرمة miqrama, مقرم miqram, قرام qirām and قرم qaram in Richardson's Arabic-English dictionary year 1852 and AlMaany.com Arabic-English dictionary year 2015. The Arabic miqram is rootwise formally related to قرم qaram = \\"to nibble persistently\\". The path to English is said to be: Arabic -> Turkish -> Italian -> French -> English. 19th-century English. ;magazine : مخازن makhāzin, storehouses, storerooms. Contains the Arabic root khazan = \\"to store\\" and the Arabic noun prefix m-. The earliest known record in a European language is Latin magazenum meaning \\"storeroom\\" in 1228 at the seaport of Marseille. The other early records in European languages are in Italian and Catalan coastal cities in the 13th century, with the same meaning.Magazeni = \\"magazine, i.e. storehouse\\" has several records in the 13th century in Italy in Latin, including 1234 in Venice – Raja Tazi 1998. Raja Tazi notes that the seaport of Venice at that time was in regular trading with the Arabic seaports of Ceuta, Béjaïa, Tunis, Oran, etc. The same was true of the seaport of Marseille, where the first record of magazenum (1228) occurs in a context of commerce by Marseille citizens in North African seaports – CNRTL.fr. Records in Catalan begin 1255 – magatzem @ Diccionari.cat. Regarding the Catalan magatzem = \\"magazine\\", its 'tz' is like the way that 'zz' is pronounced in the Italian magazzino, like how English \\"pizza\\" is pronounced \\"peetza\\". The spelling magazzino in Italian is on record from the first half of the 14th century (seaport of Pisa year 1318 has magazeno – TLIO). In Sicily the word is found in the seaport of Palermo in 1287 as machasseno and in seaport of Messina in 1284 as mahazenis – ref: Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia by Girolamo Caracausi, year 1983 on page 272 and page 273. Those and other early evidences imply that the word magazine came to the seaports of Italy and Provence and Catalonia directly from North Africa, and did not come from Spain and Portugal, did not come from the Spanish word almacen  almazen = \\"magazine\\". This point has been made in Origin and spread of Oriental words in European languages, by Arnald Steiger, year 1963. The word still has that meaning today in Arabic, French, Italian, Catalan, and Russian. It was sometimes used that way in English in the 16th to 18th centuries, but more commonly in English a magazine was a storage place for ammunitions or gunpowder, and later a receptacle for storing bullets. A magazine in the publishing sense of the word started in the English language, and its start was in the 17th century meaning a store of information about military or navigation subjects.\\"Magazine\\" in NED (year 1908). ;marcasite : مرقشيثاmarqashīthā, iron sulfide. Occurs in Arabic in a 9th-century minerals book, and was used by Al-Razi (died c. 930) and Ibn Sina (died 1037)Ibn Sina's medical encyclopedia has an entry for مارقشيتا mārqashītā. It was noted by Martin Levey, year 1962, footnote 174 that part of what Ibn Sina says about mārqashītā closely echoes what's said about marqashīthā in the so-called \\"Stone Book of Aristotle\\" (also called \\"The Lapidary of Aristotle\\"), a minerals book dated 9th century in Arabic. The \\"Stone Book of Aristotle\\", which is downloadable in Arabic at Archive.org, has overall many clear influences from Syriac. Modern dictionaries of the historical Syriac language, citing early medieval Syriac sources, have marq(a)shita (also maqashitha) meaning iron sulfides, marcasite and pyrite – ref, ref, ref. The Arabic marqashita does not look native in Arabic. The word's early records in Syriac can be taken as good evidence that the word entered Arabic through Syriac. Many of the stone names in the so-called \\"Stone Book of Aristotle\\" are considered to be of Iranian origin and that can be true of marqashita too – Mineralogy & Crystallography: On the History of these Sciences through 1919 (pages 30–31). and Al-Biruni (died 1048),The 11th century Book of Precious Stones by Al-Biruni is online in Arabic at مكتبة-المصطفى.com. Search text for مارقشيثا and مرقشيثا. among others. The word's earliest known records in the European languages are in Arabic-to-Latin translations dated late 12th century.Latin marchasita is in the medical book Liber Canonis Medicinae of Ibn Sina (died 1037) translated from Arabic to Latin by Gerard of Cremona (died c. 1187) – Ref. That translation is cited at marcassite @ CNRTL.fr as the earliest-known of the word in a European language.Latin marchasita  markasita is in the minerals book Liber de Aluminibus et Salibus, which is an Arabic-to- Latin translation with an estimated date in Latin about 1200. Its Arabic author is unknown but he was influenced by a minerals book by Al-Razi (died c. 930). This medieval Arabic text and medieval Latin translation are published in Das Buch der Alaune und Salze, year 1935, curated by Julius Ruska; the text's section G §39 has Arabic مرقشيثا marqashīthā translated as Latin markasita; see also marchasita in section G §71 Latin. In modern English, marcasite is defined scientifically as orthorhombic iron sulfide, but marcasite jewelry is jewelry made from isometric iron sulfide.Colcothar, Tutty, and Zarnich are three obsolete English names originating in medieval Arabic alchemy. They have been replaced by the modern names iron oxide, zinc oxide, and arsenic sulfide, respectively. Marcasite meaning iron sulfide has survived in modern science because the word was redefined in the mid-19th century to designate a certain narrow type of iron sulfide. The older, broader meaning of marcasite dates from late medieval centuries in English (examples). Today the most common type of iron sulfide is usually called by the name pyrite. But jewelry made from pyrite is still called \\"marcasite jewelry\\", a term that got established in English in the 18th century. ;massicot : مسحقونيا masḥaqūniyā  مسحوقونيا masḥūqūniyā, a glazing material applied in the manufacture of pottery. In today's English massicot is defined as orthorhombic lead monoxide (PbO). Historically, in the late medieval and early modern West, the most common context of use of lead monoxide (including massicot) was in the manufacture of lead-based pottery glazes, and, later, lead glass. The Western word's history starts with late medieval Latin massacumia, which was a pottery glazing material in Italy in the late 13th century (sometimes lead- based and sometimes not), and came from Arabic masḥaqūniyā (mas-ha-qun-iya) meaning approximately the same.Different dictionaries report different origins for \\"massicot\\". The origin reported here is the one in massicot @ CNRTL.fr, massicot @ Random House Dictionary, marzacotto @ TLIO.ovi.cnr.it, marzacotto @ treccani.it, mazacote @ RAE.es. The modern English name massicot came from the 15th century French massicot which came from the 14th century Italian mazzacotto (1303), Italian maççacocti (1312), Italian marzacotto (1355), which in Italian in the 14th century was a glaze for earthenware, not necessarily lead-based – TLIO (in Italian). Medieval Arabic writers having مسحقونيا masḥaqūniyā  مسحوقونيا masḥūqūniyā as a glaze for earthenware include Ibn Ahmad Ibn Yusuf Al-Khwarizmi (lived c. 980) (Ref), Al-Biruni (died 1048) (Ref), and Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) (Ref). The derivation of the European word from the Arabic word is complicated, and involves the fact that the European word has records in the 13th and 14th centuries in Latin in Italy in the wordform massacumia (and in France in Latin in the 14th century as massacumia, and in Spain in Spanish in the 13th century as maçaconia). For details see English Words Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #100: Massicot. ;mattress, matelasse : مطرح matrah, a large cushion or rug for lying on. In Arabic the sense evolved out of the sense \\"something thrown down\\" from Arabic root tarah = \\"to throw\\". Classical Latin matta = \\"mat\\" is no relation. The word is in Catalan-Latin in the 12th century as almatrac. It is in Italian-Latin in the 13th century as matratium, almatracium, and similar. It spread into French and English in the 14th century. The mattress word at that time in Europe usually meant a padded under-blanket, \\"a quilt to lie upon\\".In standard Arabic today مطرح matrah means \\"location\\"; it does not mean mattress or rug or suchlike. But in medieval Arabic there is lots of documentation that, in addition to meaning \\"location\\", it had a meaning of a rug or padded fabric for lying on. A handful of medieval Arabic examples are given in Reinhart Dozy, year 1869 including from the writers Al-Tha'alabi (died 1038), Ibn Hayyan (died 1075), and Al-Qazwini (died 1283). The Cairo Geniza records of the 11th and 12th centuries contain many instances of Arabic matrah meaning a padded fabric for sleeping on – A Mediterranean Society: Volume IV, Daily Life, by S.D. Goitein, year 1967. A reason for confidence that the medieval European mattress word came from Arabic is that the word was sometimes spelled with al- prefixed in European languages. Some examples of that are given in Dozy's book and one additional example is the year 1291 Latin almatracium @ DuCange. The letter 'c' in the Latin almatracium  mataracium was pronounced as sound /s/. Medieval Latin also had almatracum  materacum where the 'c' was pronounced as sound /k/. The 'h' of the Arabic matrah is strongly aspirated. Especially when it occurs at the end of a word, there is nothing close to it in the Latinate languages (nor in English). It is denoted sound / ħ/. It was converted to /k/ in Catalan almatrac and /s/ in Italian materasso. In the European languages the word's earliest known records are in Catalan-Latin in legal notarizations spelled almatrazt (circa 1085), almatraf (year 1122), and almatrac (year 1134); more about those early instances is in the book La Terminologia Tèxtil a la Documentació Llatina de la Catalunya Altomedieval, by Laura Trias Ferri, year 2012. The mattress word in later-medieval Europe usually meant a somewhat padded underblanket, not a deep stuffed mattress, not a \\"featherbed\\". Sets of medieval examples are online at MED (in English), DMF (in French), TLIO (in Italian), Caracausi (in Sicilian), Gual Camarena (Catalan and Spanish), almadraque @ CORDE (in Spanish), Benecke Müller (in German), Matthias Lexer (in German), and Du Cange (in Latin) (Latin wordforms in Du Cange include matracium, matratium, matratum, mataratium, materatium, materacium, almatracum). In the early records in European languages in some cases the padding material was cotton fluff, which in those days was an import from Arabic lands and was a preferred material for padding fabrics. Example: year 1232 Italian-Latin materacum bombesi where bombesi = \\"cotton fluff\\". Example: year 1298 Italian una materazza... piene di bambagia = \\"a mattress filled with cotton lint\\". The Arabs slept on padded blankets which were rolled up and put away during the day, and spread out on the floor at bedtime; \\"they did not have beds properly speaking in the fashion of us French\\" – Devic year 1876; \\"everyone passing through the Middle East can understand how a word for a throw can lead to a word for a bed\\" – Lammens year 1890. ;mecca : مكة makkah, An epicentre of a subculture, ethnicity, common interests/demographic or certain requirement group to gather at, that is established either formally or informally ;mohair, moiré : المخيّر al-mokhayyar, high-quality cloth made from fine goat hair (from Arabic root khayar = \\"choosing, preferring\\"). Mohair from the hair of Angora goats in Ankara province in Turkey in the early 16th century was the original cloth named mohair in the West, although earlier mohair-type cloth had been imported from the Middle East under the name camlet.House Owners and House Property in Seventeenth-Century Ankara and Kayseri, by Suraiya Faroqhi, year 1987, page 25. Histoire du commerce du Levant au moyen-âge, by W. Heyd, year 1886, Volume 2, pages 703-705. \\"Rediscovering Camlet: Traditional mohair cloth weaving in Southeastern Turkey\\", by Charlotte Jirousek, in Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings year 2008, pages 1-3. Earliest record in the West is 1542 Italian. Early English was spelled \\"mocayare\\", starting 1570. The mutation in English to \\"mohaire\\" is first seen in 1619.\\"Mohair\\" in NED (year 1908). Moiré means a shimmering visual effect from an interweaved or grating structure. It started out in French as a mutation of mohair. ;monsoon, typhoon : These words referred to wind and rain events off the coasts of India and China in their earliest use in Western languages and are seen first in Portuguese in the early 16th century. Arabic sea-merchants were active in the East Indies long before the Portuguese arrived – see e.g. Islam in the Philippines and camphor and benzoin in this list. موسم mawsim, season, used in Arabic for anything that comes round once a year (such as festive season) and used by Arab sailors in the East Indies for the seasonal sailing winds.In India, from October to April the winds blow from the northeast, while from April to October they blow approximately from the southwest (with heavy rains arriving in June); see monsoon of India. The first governor of Portuguese India, Afonso de Albuquerque (died 1515), often mentions the monsoon winds in his letters. He usually spells it mouçam. E.g. in a letter on 8 November 1514 he writes of trade goods which were \\"am de partyr nesta mouçam d abryll\\" = \\"to depart at this April's monsoon\\" – ref. The Portuguese ç is pronounced s. Mouçam is phonetically close to the Arabic mawsim. Diogo do Couto lived in Portuguese India in the 1560s, and consistently spelled it moução (ref: Yule & Burnell), which is close to the Arabic form as well -- the letter ã of Portuguese is 'a' with nasalization and is etymologically an 'an'. Portuguese usually replaces 'an' with ã. From the Portuguese word, an Italian traveler in India in the 1560s, Cesare Federici, writing in Italian, spelled it moson (ref: Yule & Burnell). But in Portuguese India during the 16th century the dominant wordform became monção, from causes not understood. English sailors in the late 16th century in India adopted it with spelling monson, from monção. In year 1442, Persian historian and ambassador Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi sailed to India from the Persian Gulf, starting at the port of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. He sailed back home again in 1444. He wrote in Persian a 45-page narrative of his trip. The following is a quote from a published English translation, plus three of his Persian words have been put in brackets together with alternative translation: \\"The favorable time for departing by sea [to India from the Persian Gulf]... is the beginning or middle of the monsoon [= موسم mawsim = sailing season]... The end of the monsoon [= آخر موسم ākher mawsim = last part of the sailing season] is the season [= زمان zamān = time] when tempests [= طوفان tūfān = violent sea-storm] and attacks from pirates are to be dreaded.... The time for navigation having passed, every one who would put to sea at this season was alone responsible for his death, since he voluntarily placed himself in peril.\\" – ref: Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi in Persian (on page 344) and in English translation. An admiral in the Turkish navy, Seydi Ali Reis, traveled with Arabs on the Indian Ocean in the mid 1550s. He started out from the Iraqi port of Basra. Writing in Turkish in 1556, he says that when he was in Basra he had to wait for almost half a year for the arrival of what he called the mowsim = \\"sailing season\\" – ref, alt link. A century later, French traveller Jean de Thévenot set sail to India from Basra. Thévenot had lived in the Middle East for about five years previously and could speak Arabic. He wrote: \\"I set out from Balsora [i.e. Basra] on the sixth of November 1665.... The proper season for sailing on the Indian Sea is called mousson or monson by corruption from [Arabic] moussem. The season wherein there is a constant Trade Wind upon that Sea begins commonly at the end of October and lasts to the end of April.\\" – ref: in French, in English translation. Arabic mawsim is from Arabic root wasem = \\"to mark\\" and Arabic grammar prefix m-. It is not hard to find mawsim in medieval Arabic in the sense of \\"season, time of year\\". E.g. botanist Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) has المطر الموسمي al-matar al-mawsemī = \\"seasonal rain\\" (in a climate having rainy and rainless seasons) and he also has الموسم بمكة al- mawsem be-meka = \\"pilgrimage season\\" – ref. More historical details in Yule & Burnett, NED, Dozy, CNRTL.fr. طوفان tūfān, a big rainstorm, a deluge, and used in the Koran for Noah's Flood.The typhoon storm was written tufão in 1540 in Portuguese, touffon in 1588 in English, and tuffon in 1610 in English – all very close to the Arabic tūfān. The Koran uses this word for The Deluge in Sura29:Verse14 and the medieval Arabic dictionaries define tūfān also as \\"overwhelming rain\\" (http://www.Baheth.info ). The English word-form was later affected by the ancient Greek mythological demon Typhon – see typhon @ CNRTL.fr. It was perhaps also affected by a Chinese word tai feng. \\"Sometimes [typhoon is] claimed as a Chinese word meaning 'a great wind' [tai feng]... but this seems to be a late mystification.\\" – Yule & Burnell. Other early records for the typhoon word in English include the following: tufan (1614), tuffon (1615), tufon (1625), tuffon (1626), tuffon (1665), tuffin (1674), tuffoon (1699), tuffoon (1721), tuffoon (1727), tuffoon (1745), tay-fun (1771), tiffoon (1773), tuffoon (1780), typhawn (1793), tuffoon (1802), ty- foong (1806), touffan (1811), typhoon (1819), toofan (1826), toofaun (1826), tiffoon (1831), typhoon (1832), typhoon (1840), tyfoon (1848), tufan (1850), typhoon (1851) – ref: NED; also Yule & Burnell. The first known record of the word-form \\"typhoon\\" in English is in 1819 in the classically educated poet Percy Bysshe Shelley who never went to the Indies or China. Turkish navy admiral Sidi Ali Reis (died 1563) travelled on Arab ships on the Indian Ocean in the 1550s and wrote in Turkish: \\"We left the port of Guador [in today's Pakistan] and again steered for Yemen. We had been at sea for several days... when suddenly from the west arose a great storm known as fil tofani [where fil = \\"elephant\\" in Arabic and Turkish].... As compared to these awful tempests, the foul weather in the Mediterranean and Black Sea is mere child's play and their towering billows are as drops of water compared to those of the Indian Sea.\\" – ref. More about the early history of the two words among European sailors in the East Indies is in A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive, by Yule and Burnell (year 1903). ;mufti (clothing style) : مفتي muftī , mufti (an expert in Islamic law). The phrase 'mufti day' is sometimes used instead of 'own clothes day' in some English speaking schools to mean a day when students and teachers can wear casual clothes or clothes in their own style rather than the institution's uniform or semi-uniform clothes. The term originated in the British Army in the early 19th century. It seems the term originated just because the clothing style of a mufti was much different from the style of the army's uniform clothing at the time.http://dictionary.com/browse/mufti ;mummy : موميا mūmiyā, a bituminous substance used in medicine and in embalming, and secondarily sometimes it meant a corpse embalmed with the substance. The later-medieval Western languages borrowed the Arabic word in those senses.The Canon of Medicine of Ibn Sina (died 1037) has Arabic mūmiyā  mūmiyāyī = \\"medicinal bitumen\\". This is written in Latin as mumia in Gerard of Cremona's late 12th century translation of Ibn Sina's book. Among the first records in Latin is mumia = \\"medicinal bitumen\\" in the Arabic-to-Latin medical translator Constantinus Africanus (died c. 1087) (ref). Bitumen here means viscous tar found naturally in the ground with some sand or other minerals naturally mixed in to some degree. As offspring from the medieval Latin, the following is an example in an English medical book in 1475: \\"Make a plastir of bole and sandragon and mummie and sumac and of gum arabike\\" – MED. Another English example, this dated 1425, spelling modernised: \\"Another emplaister [plaster dressing] to the same, Take mummie, glue..bole armoniak, aloes, and half an ounce mastic\\" – MED. In later-medieval Europe this medicinal mummie was an import from the Eastern Mediterranean with much of it coming ultimately from Iran and Yemen – Histoire du Commerce du Levant au Moyen-âge, by W. Heyd, year 1886, Volume 2 pages 635-636. Studies on the embalming methods used by the ancient Egyptians to embalm and preserve the famous Egyptian mummies show: (1) the methods used were quite variable and (2) bituminous material was used in many cases and (3) wood tar or cedar oil was used in other cases and contributed to preserving the corpse in a black or near-black color in the long term – A History of Egyptian Mummies, by J.T. Pettigrew, year 1834, Chapter VI: On Embalming, especially pages 70-71. From the corpse's bituminous or tarry material and its black color, the term mūmiyā came to be applied to the whole corpse. This transfer of meaning started in Egypt. Abdallatif al-Baghdadi (died 1231) in his description of Egypt says a black bituminous matter taken from ancient embalmed corpses is available for purchase in Egypt under the name mūmiyā, and he says it is purchased to be used medicinally in the same way as the ordinary mūmiyā – ref. The medicines book of Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) says that one of the sources of medicinal mūmiyā is the mūmiyā that is taken from old embalmed corpses found in the burial tombs in Egypt – ref. That kind of medicinal mumia, taken from ancient embalmed corpses of Egypt, made its way into medieval Latin medicines books as well – e.g. in Pandectarum Medicinae of Matthaeus Silvaticus, year 1317. Today's Arabic mūmiyāʾ means \\"mummy\\". Post- medievally in the West the sense was extended to a corpse preserved by desiccation (drying out).The post-medieval evolution of Mummy's meaning in English is documented in NED. ;muslin : موصلي mūsilī, fine lightweight fabric made in Mosul in Mesopotamia, usually cotton, sometimes linen. The word entered Western Europe with the same meaning in the 16th and early 17th century. The fabric was imported from Aleppo by Italians at the time. The earliest record in English is muslina in a traveller's report from Aleppo in 1609. The ending -ina was an Italian addition. In Italian, a suffix -ina acts as a diminutive (communicates lightweight).Muslin meaning fine lightweight cotton fabric made in Mosul has it earliest record in European languages in the Latin writer Andreas Alpagus Bellunensis (died c. 1522), an Italian who lived in Damascus for decades. He spelled the fabric name as mussoli in Latin – he is quoted in Yule & Burnell (1903). Another early record is in the German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf, who travelled round the Levant in 1573–1575 and published a 350-page narrative of his visit. When talking about muslin in Aleppo, Rauwolf says the stuff is brought to Aleppo from Mosul, it is made from cotton, and the Arabs call it \\"Mossellini\\" – ref German 1582 edition (page 93) (Cf an English translation 1693 (page 62)). But Rauwolf's wordform Mossellini looks like it's the Italian merchants' wordform, because the Arabic wordform was mūsilī with no letter 'n' (Dozy 1869, Lammens 1890, CNRTL.fr), and -ini in Italian is a diminutive. Italian speakers dominated the commerce between Aleppo and Western Europe at that time. William Biddulph, an English traveller in Aleppo writing in 1609, says \\"muslina\\" is a type of cloth brought to Aleppo from Mosul, but he says it is made from linen – NED. The English word \\"shash\\"  \\"sash\\" entered English from Arabic shāsh at about the same time as muslin. The Arabic shāsh was a long ribbon of lightweight muslin wrapped to form a turban. It was many meters long. It could be of cotton or linen. A large part of the market for fine lightweight muslin in the Middle East in those days was for shāsh turbans. The Thousand and One Nights tales has Arabic وإلى رأسه شاش موصلي = \\"and on his head a shāsh mūsilī \\". John Florio's Italian dictionary in 1611 has Italian mussolo defined as \\"a kind of head-attire or turbant that the Persians wear\\" – ref. Later in the 17th century and still today in Italian mussola = \\"muslin\\". Italian today also has mussolina = \\"fine muslin\\". Words which may or may not be of Arabic origin ;lilac : It is well documented that the common lilac tree was originally brought to Western Europe directly from Istanbul in the early 1560s. Among the earliest records of the tree and of the word in the Western European languages are in botany books in Latin by P.A. Matthiolus in 1565 and Carolus Clusius in 1576 stating that the \\"Lilac\\" tree was recently brought to Western Europe from the Turks and from Istanbul.The early history of the lilac plant in Western Europe is in the book The Lilac: a monograph, by Susan Delano McKelvey, year 1928, on pages 204-209. The species of lilac that was first grown in Western Europe is the Common Lilac (Syringa vulgaris). It was first introduced to Western Europe at or before 1563 by an ambassador of Austria stationed in Istanbul, ambassador Ogier de Busbecq. Busbecq sent specimens of the plant to the professional botanist Petrus Andreas Matthiolus, who at that time was employed by the Austrian rulers. The first published instance of the name is in a botany book by Matthiolus in 1565 in Latin. Matthiolus in 1565 said Austria's ambassador \\"Busbeke\\" brought the plant from Istanbul (Constantinople) under the name LILAC (Ref). Busbecq was stationed in Istanbul from 1556 to 1563. He is credited with being among the earliest to bring to western Europe several kinds of ornamental flowering plants, which he had found in cultivation in Istanbul. Busbecq said: \\"The Turks are passionately fond of flowers\\" (Ref). Busbecq planted lilacs at his house in Vienna in Austria in 1563, and it is possible that during the period 1557-1563 an associate of Busbecq in Istanbul may have distributed some lilacs to the West for planting. Those plantings are the earliest known lilacs to grow in any European gardens outside the Balkans – Ref, ref. The botanist Carolus Clusius lived in Vienna from 1573 to 1588 in the employment of the Austrian rulers. Lilac is in a botany book by Clusius in 1576, where Clusius says the plant has come from the Turks (Ref) and in a second edition in 1601 Clusius says the plant was brought from Istanbul specifically (Ref). The earliest known instance of lilac in French is in a Latin-to-French translation of Matthiolus's book in 1572 (Ref). The next known in French is in 1605 (Ref). The earliest known in English is in 1596 in the botanist John Gerarde, who mentions Matthiolus by name in connection with the plant (\\"Lylac Mathioli\\") (Ref). John Gerarde at that time had the plant growing in London. A book of Gerarde's in 1597 has a good drawing of a lilac branch and has a criticism of Matthiolus's plant description (ref: pages 1213-1215). Some of today's English dictionaries continue to say erroneously that the word lilac entered Western Europe by transfer from Arabic to Spanish (with no date given). Therefore, it is worth mentioning that today's Spanish dictionaries say the Spanish lila = \\"lilac\\" has been borrowed from the French (e.g. Diccionario RAE), which is to say that Spanish researchers have found no record in Spanish until some time after the records begin in French. The large Spanish database CORDE, although not all-inclusive, has no record in Spanish until 1772. \\"Lilac\\" is in English in the botanist John Gerarde in 1596 and 1597, a date which ranks among the word's earliest in any vernacular Western European language. The early word in Western Europe had the exclusive meaning of the common lilac tree (aka Syringa vulgaris). The tree's native place of origin was the Balkans, where it blooms in the wild with light-purple blue-ish flowers. There is reason to think the name may be descended from a Persian word for blue-ish color. The Persian is not attested as a tree or a flower; it is attested as a color. A route of intermediation involving Arabic is a slim possibility.The common lilac tree is popular in gardens in Russia and Canada. It will not bloom under cultivation in most Arabic-speaking locales because the winters are not cold enough; the tree requires a length of cold weather to set the buds for bloom – Refs: The Lilac: a monograph, by Susan Delano McKelvey, year 1928 on pages 212-215 and 230; and Lilacs: the genus Syringa, by John L. Fiala, year 1988, on pages 5, 13 and 15-18. The tree is native in upland areas of the Balkans, where it blooms with light-violet color, and it has not been demonstrated to be native anywhere else – same refs. In world history, the earliest recorded notice of the tree comes from 16th century Istanbul, where it was grown as an ornamental, and from where it was brought to northwestern Europe for the same purpose in the later 16th. The Balkans were part of the Turkish Empire at the time. However, the western European botanists at the time imagined that the Turks in Istanbul must have gotten the new tree species from somewhere in the Orient. It was not until more than two centuries later (beginning in 1828) that Western botanists discovered and confirmed it was native in the Balkans, and afterwards the earlier misperception was shaken off only gradually – \\"A visit to the home of the lilac\\", by Edgar Anderson, year 1935, pages 2 and 4. The tree does not have a known record in Arabic until two centuries after the records begin in English and French; :fr:Ellious Bocthor (died 1821), an Egyptian who lived in northern France, seems to be the author of the first known record in Arabic – see e.g. Dozy, year 1869 page 297. The lilac tree is called люляк leulyak (\\"lewl-yak\\") in today's Bulgarian and liliac (\\"leel-yak\\") in today's Romanian. In Turkish, it is called leylak today, and it was called leylak or \\"lilac\\" in Turkish in the 16th century. The Turkish was the direct source of the Western European word (details above). It is possible that the 16th century Turkish tree-name leylak was originally sourced from the southern Balkans, since the tree itself certainly was. The quantity of writings from late medieval and 16th century Balkans languages is small, and it is small also in Turkish. For that reason and other reasons, evidence is not available to determine where the Turkish name came from. ;macabre : Records begin in late medieval French (1376). All the early records involve \\"the very specific phrase danse macabre, which denoted a dance in which a figure representing death enticed people to dance with him until they dropped down dead.\\"Quoted from Word Origins by John Ayto (year 2005). Likewise reported at CNRTL.fr. A non-Arabic candidate for the origin of the French exists but has semantic and phonetic weaknesses.Dictionnaire Étymologique Des Mots Français D'Origine Orientale, by L. Marcel Devic, year 1876 on page 153. The meaning can be fitted to the Arabic مقابر maqābir = \\"graves\\". Maqābir is frequent in medieval Arabic meaning a cemetery. Medieval Portuguese almocavar = \\"cemetery for Muslims or Jews\\" is certainly from the Arabic al-maqābir.Glossaire des mots espagnols et portugais dérivés de l'arabe by R. Dozy & W.H. Engelmann. 430 pages. Published in 1869.There is a Spanish almacabra = \\"Islamic graveyard\\" – Diccionario RAE. Almacabra is rare. Its earliest known record is 1554 (two centuries after the earliest French macabre). Almocavar has records from centuries earlier in medieval Portuguese, beginning in Portuguese Latin in 1137 – Iberoromanische Arabismen, by Y. Kiegel-Keicher, year 2005 on page 138. But there is no known historical context for a transfer of the Arabic (via any pathway) into the French danse macabre. That is a major weakness. ;mafia : Mafia comes from Sicilian mafiusu. Further etymology uncertain and disputed. Some propose an Arabic root for mafiusu; others say the word history prior to 19th century is unknown. ;mask, masquerade, mascara, masque : Late medieval Italian maschera = \\"mask put upon a person's face\\" is the source for the French, English and Spanish set of words.CNRTL.fr, C-OED, M-W, NED, máscara @ RAE.es, CORDE, Diccionari.cat. The first known record in Italian is dated 1351 (occurring in Boccaccio's Decameron). The source for the Italian word is highly uncertain. One possibility is the Latin precedent masca = \\"witch\\". One other possibility is the Arabic precedent مسخرة maskhara = \\"buffoon, jester\\". In the context where mask was used, \\"the sense of entertainment is the usual one in old authors\\"; see Carnival of Venice, Masquerade Ball, Mascherata. ;massage : The English comes from French. The French is first recorded in 1779 as a verb masser = \\"to massage\\" which then produced the noun massage starting in 1808. The origin of the French has not been explained. Most of the early records in French are found in accounts of travels in the Middle East. The practice of massage was common in the Middle East for centuries before it became common in the West in the mid-to-late 19th century; see Turkish bath. Consequently, there has been a proposal that the French word be from Arabic مسّ mass = \\"to touch\\". But the Arabic word for massage was a different word, namely tamsīd  dallak  tadlīk. The fact that the early records in French did not use an Arabic word for massage seems to preclude the hypothesis that the word they did use was borrowed from Arabic. A different hypothesis is the Portuguese amassar = \\"to knead\\" and/or Spanish amasar  masar = \\"to knead\\",In Spanish, amasar is the usual word for \\"to knead\\" but Spanish also has a lesser-used form masar = \\"to knead\\" – Diccionario RAE. which are descended from classical Latin massa meaning \\"mass\\", \\"lump of material\\" and \\"kneaded dough\\", and are longstanding commonplace words in Spanish and Portuguese for kneading of bread dough. ; mizzen-mast : Mizzen (or mizen) is a type of sail or position of a sail-mast on a ship. English is traceable to 14th-century Italian mez(z)ana = \\"mizzen\\". The medieval mizzen was a smaller sail situated near the rear of the ship and its primary purpose was to improve steerage (it was not really for propulsion). Most dictionaries say the Italian word came from medieval native Italian mezzo meaning \\"middle\\", from a classical Latin word meaning \\"middle\\". But the mizzen sail does not have semantic concordance with \\"middle\\". The alternative is: \\"It is possible that the Italian word... is really adopted from Arabic ميزان mīzān = \\"balance\\". The mizen is, even now, a sail that 'balances,' and the reef in a mizen is still called the 'balance'-reef.\\"An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English (year 1921), by Ernest Weekley. ; mortise : The word's origin in 13th-century France is without an explanation in terms of French or Latin. Some dictionaries mention an Arabic hypothesis.

In his early life, McHugh was a builder and was also involved in youth crimes. When he was 51, he suffered a stroke on both sides of his brain that resulted in two burst blood vessels. He was sent into a coma for a week and acquired savant syndrome.  Injury  McHugh attempted to evacuate his bowels quickly due to a knock on the toilet door. The sudden pressure led to an artery being severed on his frontal and temporal lobes, causing him to haemorrhage. While relearning after his stroke, he began to write poetry to express everything he was experiencing. He also experienced an identity crisis which was most likely the motivation for his artistic outputs. As an attempt to figure out the cause of his sudden personality change, McHugh wrote to and worked with two neuroscientists: Alice Flaherty from Harvard Medical School and Mark Lythgoe from University College London. A paper has been published about their discoveries.M.F. Lythgoe, T.A. Pollak, M. Kalmas, M. de Haan, W.

That sense for the word was used by, e.g., the astronomer Al-Battani (died 929). Naẓīr in medieval Arabic more broadly meant \\"counterpart\\". \\"The Arabic 'z' here used is the 17th letter of the Arabic alphabet, an unusual letter with a difficult sound, which came to be rendered by 'd' in Low Latin.\\"Reported in An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, by Walter W. Skeat, year 1888. Downloadable. The word's earliest records in the West are in 12th- and 13th-century Latin astronomy texts as nadahir and nadir, with the same meaning as the Arabic, and the earliest is in an Arabic-to-Latin translation.In the mid-12th century, Plato Tiburtinus did an Arabic-to-Latin translation of an astronomy book by Al-Battani (died 929). In the translation, Al-Battani's Arabic naẓīr and naẓīra was written down in Latin as nadahir. This was remarked on in a history of astronomy by Jean Delambre in 1819 – ref. The 10th century text by Al-Battani is in Arabic at AlChamel14.org (also at Archive.org and Al-Hakawati.net), and its 12th century translation by Plato Tiburtinus is at Books.Google.com. The earliest reported secure record for the wordform nadir in the West is dated circa 1233 in the short and influential astronomy textbook De Sphaera Mundi by Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sacrobosco's book was influenced by Arabic astronomy; e.g. it quotes by name the Arabic astronomer Al-Farghani (aka Alfraganus) five times. In the context of talking about how planet Earth blocks sunlight from reaching the moon during a lunar eclipse, Sacrobosco says in Latin: \\"The nadir is a point in outer space directly opposite to the sun.\\" That statement by Sacrobosco uses nadir in the sense the Arabic naẓīr was used, which in Arabic had a core meaning of \\"counterpart\\".

The medieval Arabs had this spelled نطرون natrūn with the same meaning. Today's European word natron, meaning hydrated sodium carbonate, is descended from the Arabic.English dictionaries saying \\"natron\\" is from Arabic include Merriam-Webster, American Heritage Dictionary, Random House Dictionary, Etymonline, Concise OED, NED, and Weekley. According to all those English dictionaries, the transfer from Arabic to the Western languages was through Spanish, at an unspecified date. But all the main Spanish dictionaries say Spanish natron is from French. That includes the official dictionary of the Spanish language, Diccionario RAE. The Spanish natron, and also the variant anatron, \\"are modern technical terms borrowed from French\\", says the Spanish and Arabic expert Federico Corriente (year 2008). The earliest known modern record of natron in Spanish is year 1817, says the Spanish etymology dictionary Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana (year 1957). The earliest French is 1653 – CNRTL.fr. The earliest English is 1684 – NED. \\"Natron\\" and the closely associated \\"anatron\\" were established together in English dictionaries from 1706. Nathan Bailey's English Dictionary in 1737 defined natron as \\"a kind of black, greyish salt taken out of a lake of stagnant water in the territory of Terrana in Egypt\\" – ref; and defined \\"anatron\\" as any of several salts including one taken from Egypt – ref. The substance natron was brought to Europe from Egypt in the medieval centuries as well as in the early modern centuries. The usual word for it in medieval Latin was nitrum (etymologically from ancient Greek without Arabic intermediation). It was called nitrum in late medieval English as well – MED. One late medieval Latin dictionary defined nitrum as \\"a kind of salt brought from Alexandria\\", Egypt – ref: Alphita. In the medieval Latin literature more generally nitrum could also be a name for other alkaline salts – ref. In Arabic, a 9th-century Arabic minerals book said natrūn is a type of salt used as a washing agent – ref. That is natron. Many more examples from medieval Arabic are at AlWaraq.net under النطرون al-natrūn and نطرون natrūn. The wordform \\"natron\\" occurs in Latin in Italy in a book by Simon of Genoa in the late 13th century, in which \\"natron\\" was stated to be simply \\"the Arabic word for nitrum\\" – ref: Raja Tazi, year 1998. The wordform \\"anatron\\" (formed from al-natrūn) occurs in Latin around year 1300 in a book by the influential Latin alchemist Pseudo-Geber – ref: Pseudo-Geber as published 1542. Both of those two medieval Latin writers had some knowledge of Arabic language. Natron and anatron were rare in medieval Latin. However, in the 16th century, anatron  anathron was adopted in Latin in Germany in the widely disseminated writings of Paracelsus (died 1541) – Paracelsus was influenced by Pseudo-Geber – and then by Paracelsus's followers Oswald Croll (died 1609) and Martin Ruland (died 1602) – ref: Raja Tazi, year 1998. Martin Ruland also used the spelling natron and said natron was synonymous with nitrum – ref: Martin Ruland, year 1612. Despite those precedents in Latin, today's official dictionary of the French language judges that the French natron arrived in French directly from Arabic natrūn, from Egypt, in the mid-17th century, meaning sodium carbonate – CNRTL.fr. In early 17th century Europe the name nitrum had undesirable ambiguity, as can be seen in the several incompatible meanings for nitrum given in Martin Ruland's 1612 Lexicon Alchemiae. The primary meaning for nitrum was becoming potassium nitrate, aka nitre (the parent of \\"nitrogen\\"). Undoubtedly this encouraged adoption of name natron to reduce the potential for misunderstanding. In Europe shortly after sodium was isolated as an element for the first time, in the early 19th century, sodium was given the scientific abbreviation Na from a newly created Latin name, initially natronium then natrium, which goes back etymologically to the medieval and early modern Arabic natrūn.\\"Natrium\\" at Elementymology & Elements Multidict. Also in the early 19th century, elemental potassium was isolated for the first time and was soon afterwards given the scientific abbreviation K representing a created Latin name Kalium, which was derived from 18th century scientific Latin Kali meaning potassium carbonate, which goes back etymologically to medieval Arabic al-qalī, which for the medieval Arabs was a mixture of potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate.\\"Kalium\\" at Elementymology & Elements Multidict. Crossref alkali on the list. O ;orange: نارنج nāranj, orange (a citrus fruit), via Persian and Sanskrit nāraṅga from a Dravidian language. The orange tree came from India. It was introduced to the Mediterranean region by the Arabs in the early 10th century, at which time all oranges were bitter oranges.Origin of Cultivated Plants by Alphonse de Candolle (year 1885), pages 183–188 for orange. Further details in \\"Études sur les noms arabes des végétaux: l'oranger et ses congénères\\", by J.J. Clément-Mullet in Journal Asiatique sixième série Tome XV, pages 17 to 41, year 1870. The geographer Al- Masudi writing in the 940s (AD) said that the orange tree (shajar al-nāranj) had been introduced to Arabic-speaking lands only a few decades previously (ref). The word is in all the Mediterranean Latin languages from the later medieval centuries. Today it is naranja in Spanish. Today it is arancia in Italian, and orange in French, and this wordform with the loss of the leading 'n' occurs early as Latin arangia (late 12th centuryGeorge Gallesio's history of the culture of citrus fruits (year 1811) (online) cites arangias acetoso used in Latin in a letter entitled Ad Petrum Panormitanae Ecclesiae Thesaurarium dated 1189 and attributed to a Latin author of the later 12th century named Hugo Falcandus. The same is cited in Du Cange's Glossary of Medieval Latin.). P ;popinjay (parrot) : ببغاء babaghāʾ  babbaghāʾ, parrot. The change from medieval Arabic sound /b/ to medieval Latin and French sound /p/ also occurs in the loanwords Julep, Jumper, Spinach, and Syrup.

Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales (CNRTL) is a division of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. and the English dates from a century later. The wordform was affected by the pre-existing (from classical Latin) French gai = Spanish gayo = English \\"jay (bird)\\". Parrots were imported to medieval Europe via Arabic speakers.Parrots come from tropical or at least semi-tropical environs. Parrots were imported to Mediterranean Europe in antiquity. The ancient Greek and classical Latin name for a parrot was psittacus. In the medieval era, the imports of parrots to Europe often and probably usually came through Arabic speakers. Medieval Arabic from an early date has al-bab(a)ghāʾ  al-babbaghāʾ = \\"parrot\\" as a well-known and commonplace word – الببغا + الببغاء @ AlWaraq.net. It is taken to be the parent word of the medieval Greek papagás = \\"parrot\\" (the 's' in papagás is a grammatical affix: masculine singular nominative-case nouns end in 's' in Greek grammar), and the medieval French papegai, medieval Spanish papagayo, and similar forms in other medieval European languages – popinjay @ NED. In Arabic it is not known how the word babaghā originated. The same word babaghā is in Persian. An origin in a tropical locale has been suggested. R ;realgar : رهج الغار rahj al-ghār, realgar, arsenic sulfide.Glossaire des mots espagnols et portugais dérivés de l'arabe by R. Dozy & W.H. Engelmann. 430 pages. Published in 1869. In medieval times, realgar was used as a rodent poison, as a corrosive, and as a red paint pigment. The ancient Greeks & Romans knew the substance. Other names for it in medieval Arabic writings include \\"red arsenic\\" and \\"rodent poison\\". Ibn al- Baitar in the early 13th century wrote: \\"Among the people of the Maghreb it is called rahj al-ghār\\" (literally: \\"cavern powder\\").The medieval Arabs often used the substance realgar but generally not the name realgar. The name realgar has its parentage in mostly oral, non-literary, medieval Maghrebi Arabic, as demonstrated in Reinhart Dozy, year 1869, and a supplement to what Dozy says is in Henri Lammens, year 1890. Dozy cites two medieval Arabic texts with رهج الغار rahj al-ghār = \\"realgar\\", and Lammens cites one more. In European languages the name's earliest known records are in 13th-century Spanish spelled rejalgar, and 13th-century Italian-Latin spelled realgar. Records in English of the 15th century often spelled it resalgar.Documented in the Middle English Dictionary (the \\"MED\\"). ;ream (quantity of sheets of paper) : رزمة rizma, bale, bundle. Paper itself was introduced to the Latins via the Arabs in and around the 12th and 13th centuries – the adoption by the Latins went slowly; history of paper. The Arabic word for a bundle spread to most European languages along with paper itself, with the initial transfer from Arabic happening in Iberia. Spanish was resma, Italian risma. The Catalan raima, first record 1287, looks the forerunner of the English word-form. First record in English is 1356.Rem  Reme in the MED. ;rook (chess), roc (mythology) : رخّ rukhkh, (1) the rook piece in the game of chess, (2) a mythological bird in the 1001 Arabian Nights tales. The Arabic dictionary Lisan al-Arab completed in 1290 said the chess-piece name rukhkh came from Persian; crossref check. The bird meaning for Arabic rukhkh may have come from Persian too. But not from the same word. All available evidence supports the view that the two meanings of Arabic rukhkh sprang from two independent and different roots.Some uncertainty exists about what the roots were. \\"Of Rukhs and Rooks, Camels and Castles\\", by Remke Kruk, year 2001 in ORIENS: Journal of the International Society for Oriental Research, volume 36 pages 288-298. The chess rook is in French from about 1150 onward spelled as roc. S ;sabkha (landform) : سبخة sabkha, salt marsh. This Arabic word occurs occasionally in English and French in the 19th century. Sabkha with a technical meaning as coastal salt-flat terrain came into general use in sedimentology in the 20th century through numerous studies of the coastal salt flats on the eastern side of the Arabian peninsula.An Intro to Sabkhas . Also A Proposed Formal Definition for Sabkha. Also a different Formal Definition for Sabkha. ;safari: سفر safar, journey. Safari entered English in the late 19th century from Swahili language safari = \\"journey\\" which is from Arabic safar = \\"journey\\". ;safflower : عصفر ʿusfur, safflower; or a non-standard variant عصفر ʿasfar, safflower. The flower of this plant was commercially cultivated for use as a dye in the Mediterranean region in medieval times. From the medieval Arabic word plus Arabic al-, medieval Catalan had alasfor = \\"safflower\\". Medieval Catalan also had alazflor = \\"safflower\\" where Catalan flor = \\"flower\\". But the source of the English word was medieval Italian. The \\"-fur\\" or \\"-far\\" part of the Arabic word mutated in Italian to \\"-flore  -fiore\\" which is Italian for flower. Medieval Italian spellings included asfiore, asflore, asfrole, astifore, affiore, zaflore, saffiore, all meaning safflower. In medieval Arabic dictionaries the spelling is ʿusfur, but an oral variant ʿasfar would be unexceptional in Arabic speech and would be a little better fit to the Romance language wordforms.The safflower is an annual plant that is native to a truly arid climate that has an annual rainy season. The plant has poor defenses against many types of fungal diseases in damp and rainy weather. This greatly restricts the areas in which it can be grown reliably; ref. Alphonse de Candolle in his Origin of Cultivated Plants (year 1885) reports that the ancient Greeks and Romans have not left any clear written evidence that they were acquainted with the safflower plant, particularly not for its use as a dye, even though the evidence is excellent that the ancient Egyptians used safflower – ref (Carthamus tinctorius). In medieval Arabic the most-often-used name for safflower was عصفر ʿusfur. Medieval Arabic dictionaries say ʿusfur is the plant that produces a well-known dye and also means the dye itself (Baheth.info) . A summary of the Italian evidence for the Arabic origin of the word \\"safflower\\" in late medieval Italian is in Yule & Burnell (year 1903) and much of Yule & Burnell's evidence comes from Pegolotti's Mercatura, year 1340. Italian variant spelling zaflore year 1310 is in TLIO. The Catalan alazflor = \\"safflower\\" was used by Francesc Eiximenis (died 1409) and the Catalan alasfor = \\"bastard saffron\\", meaning \\"safflower\\", was used in an ordinance of king Martin I of Aragon (died 1410), as cited in Vocabulario del comercio medieval: Colección de aranceles aduaneros de la Corona de Aragón (siglo XIII y XIV), by Miguel Gual Camarena, year 1968. (Francesc Eiximenis's usages were in his 1383 book Regiment de la cosa publica which is online). The Catalan alasfor = \\"safflower\\", although not often used nowadays, is still listed in modern Catalan dictionaries – ref, ref, ref, ref. In Portuguese, an old and near- obsolete form is açaflor = \\"safflower\\" and Portuguese also has alaçor = \\"safflower\\" and açafroa = \\"safflower\\". In Spanish the usual word for safflower was and is alazor which is from the Arabic al-ʿusfur = \\"the safflower\\". In the 13th century in Occitan Romance language in southern France there is safra = \\"safflower\\" and safran = \\"safflower\\" – Medical Synonym Lists from Medieval Provence. This Occitan form is understood as altered from Arabic ʿusfur  ʿasfar = \\"safflower\\" with the alteration clearly showing influence from Occitan safran = \\"saffron\\"; it is not understood as a simple direct re- purposing of safran = \\"saffron\\". By the way, according to Alphonse de Candolle and others, the ancient Greek cnikos and classical Latin cnicus is to be interpreted as a thistle-type plant different from the safflower. ;saffron :زعفران zaʿfarān, saffron. Zaʿfarān meaning saffron is commonplace from the outset of writings in Arabic.A number of large dictionaries were written in Arabic during medieval times. Searchable copies of nearly all of the main medieval Arabic dictionaries are online at Baheth.info and/or AlWaraq.net. One of the most esteemed of the dictionaries is Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari's \\"Al-Sihah\\" which is dated around and shortly after year 1000. The biggest is Ibn Manzur's \\"Lisan Al-Arab\\" which is dated 1290 but most of its contents were taken from a variety of earlier sources, including 9th- and 10th-century sources. Often Ibn Manzur names his source then quotes from it. Therefore, if the reader recognizes the name of Ibn Manzur's source, a date considerably earlier than 1290 can often be assigned to what is said. A list giving the year of death of a number of individuals who Ibn Manzur quotes from is in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, volume 1, page xxx (year 1863). Lane's Arabic- English Lexicon contains much of the main contents of the medieval Arabic dictionaries in English translation. At AlWaraq.net, in addition to searchable copies of medieval Arabic dictionaries, there are searchable copies of a large number of medieval Arabic texts on various subjects. It was common in medieval Arab cookery.Book Medieval Arab Cookery: Essays and Translations, by M. Rodinson, A.J. Arberry and C. Perry, year 2001, 527 pages. The ancient Romans used saffron but called it crocus. The earliest known for the name saffron in Latin is year 1156 safranum (location in Genoa in Italy, in a commercial contract).Safran @ CNRTL.fr and zafarana @ Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia by Girolamo Caracausi (1983). The first known record of the name saffron in a European language is in The Cartulary of Giovanni Scriba during the years 1154-1164. The name saffron became predominant in all the Western languages in the late medieval centuries, in word-forms that led to today's French safran, Italian zafferano, Spanish azafrán. Also English organic chemical safranin. ;saphena (saphenous vein) : صافن sāfin, saphenous vein (saphena vein). The saphena vein is in the human leg. It was one of the veins used in medieval medical bloodletting (phlebotomy), which was the context of use of the word medievally. Medical writers who used the word in Arabic include Al-Razi (died c. 930), Haly Abbas (died c. 990), Albucasis (died c. 1013) and Avicenna (died 1037).A Treatise on Small-Pox and Measles by Abu Becr Mohammed Ibn Zacariya Ar-Razi, Translated from the Original Arabic by William Alexander Greenhill, year 1848, translator's note on page 154 gives citations for al-sāfin = \\"saphenous vein\\" in Haly Abbas, Albucasis and Avicenna, and on page 45 has Al- Razi's usage. Albucasis's description of how to take blood from the saphenous vein is in Arabic together with English translation in the book Albucasis on Surgery and Instruments, year 1973 pages 652–653. Avicenna's Canon of Medicine uses the word al-sāfin on 32 different pages in the context of bloodletting treatments – Search results for الصافن at AlWaraq.net. In addition to medical books, some medieval Arabic general-purpose dictionaries have al-sāfin = \\"saphenous vein\\". One of these is the Fiqh al-Lugha of Al-Tha'alibi (died 1038) – ref. Another is the Lisan al-Arab dictionary – صافن @ Baheth.info. In Latin the earliest known record is in an Arabic-to-Latin translation by Constantinus Africanus (died c. 1087) translating Haly Abbas.The saphena vein is in Constantinus Africanus spelled sophena. It receives a paragraph of discussion in an article about Constantinus's terminology by Gotthard Strohmaier, year 1994 page 98. Another early record in Latin is as saphena circa 1170 in Gerard of Cremona's translation of Avicenna (ref: in Latin) and this is noted in a book about the history of anatomy terminology by Singer and Rabin, year 1946. In the Latin surgery book of Lanfranc of Milan (died 1306) the word is spelled both sophena and saphena – Ref. Some more etymology references are at saphène @ CNRTL.fr. Bloodletting, which was practiced in ancient Greek and Latin medicine, was revamped in later-medieval Latin medicine under influence from Arabic medicine. ;sash (ribbon) : شاش shāsh, a ribbon of fine cloth wrapped to form a turban, and usually made of muslin.Dictionnaire détaillé des noms des vêtements chez les Arabes by Reinhard Dozy, year 1845, on pages 235 - 243, goes into detail on the old meaning of the Arabic clothing word shāsh. Crossref muslin which entered English and other Western languages about the same time. In English the early records are in travellers' reports and among the earliest is this comment from an English traveller in the Middle East in 1615: \\"All of them wear on their heads white shashes.... Shashes are long towels of Calico wound about their heads.\\"The quote is from \\"A relation of a journey begun in 1610... containing a description of the Turkish Empire, of Egypt, of the Holy Land...\\", by George Sandys, first published in 1615: online. In the Middle East around that time it was the custom for men to wear a turban that consisted of about seven meters of fine lightweight muslin cloth wound around the head. Another traveller's description was given by Fynes Moryson in 1617: Fynes Moryson's Itinerary, 1617. More quotations of early use of \\"s[h]ash\\" in English are in NED (year 1914). In the later 17th century in English, \\"shash\\" still had that original meaning, and additionally it took on the meaning of a ribbon of fine cloth wrapped around the waist. About the beginning of the early 18th century the predominant wordform in English changed from \\"shash\\" to \\"sash\\".John Kersey's English dictionary of 1708 and Nathan Bailey's English dictionary of 1726 have \\"shash\\" defined as \\"the linen of which a Turkish turbant is made; also a kind of girdle made of silk, etc. to tie about the waist\\" (online in Bailey's). Those dictionaries have a separate entry for \\"sash\\" which they define as \\"a sort of girdle\\" [girdle = a band around the waist] (online in Bailey's). Roman Catholic and Anglican clergy sometimes wore a sash wrapped around the waist or midriff (see fascia). In a book about the clergy by John Eachard published in 1685 the word is spelled \\"shash\\" (ref), but the spelling was changed to \\"sash\\" in the 1705 edition of the same book (ref). The change in English from earlier \\"shash\\" to later \\"sash\\" is a case of phonetic dissimilation, says Weekley (1921). In Arabic today shāsh means gauze or muslin. ;sequin (clothing ornament) : سكّة sikka, minting die for coins, also meaning the place where coins were minted, and also meaning coinage in general. In its early use in English and French, sequin was the name of Venetian and Turkish gold coins, and it came from Italian zecchino (early 16th century), which came from Italian zecca (early 13th century).Medieval examples of Italian zecca are at Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini (TLIO). Its earliest record in Italian is in 1207-1208 in a trade treaty between merchants of Venice and the Sultan of Aleppo. This record is quoted at TLIO. Production of the Venetian sequin (coin) ended in 1797. \\"The word might well have followed the coin into oblivion, but in the 19th century it managed to get itself applied to the small round shiny pieces of metal applied to clothing.\\"Quote from Word Origins: The Hidden Histories of English Words, by John Ayto (year 2005). Likewise reported at CNRTL.fr and NED. ;serendipity : This word was created in English in 1754 from \\"Serendip\\", an old fairy-tale place, from سرنديب Serendīb, an old Arabic name for the island of Sri Lanka.The Arabic \\"Sarandib\\" meaning Sri Lanka also occurs in English in translations of the Sinbad the Sailor tales (which are part of the Thousand Nights and a Night tales). In a translation of these tales in 1885, the translator Richard F. Burton has a footnote that the Arabic Sarandīb  Serendīb is etymologically from Sanskritic Selan-dwipa where Selan is the same thing as the old English name \\"Ceylon\\" and dwipa is Sanskritic for \\"island\\" – ref (page 64). Further discussed at Names of Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka in year 1902 a previously unknown type of mineral was discovered and given the name Serendibite from the old Arabic name for Sri Lanka. The mineral Serendibite has since been found in North America and elsewhere, but remains very rare. Fortified in English by its resemblance to the etymologically unrelated \\"serenity\\". The tale with the serendipitous happenings was The Three Princes of Serendip. ;sheikh : شيخ shaīkh, sheikh. It has been in English since the 17th century meaning an Arab sheikh. In the 20th century it took on a slangy additional meaning of \\"strong, romantic man\\". This is attributed to a hit movie, The Sheik, 1921, starring Rudolph Valentino, and after the movie was a hit the book it was based on became a hit, and spawned imitators. ;sofa : صفّة soffa, a low platform or dais. The Arabic was adopted into Turkish, and from Turkish it entered Western languages in the 16th century meaning a Middle- Eastern-style dais with rugs and cushions. The Western-style meaning —a sofa with legs— started in late-17th-century French.\\"Sofa\\" in NED (in English), CNRTL.fr (in French), and Lammens (in French). E. W. Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon says the medieval Arabic soffa was \\"an appurtenance of a house\\" akin to a porch. Soffa had further usages in medieval Arabic; more from E. W. Lane at Ref. However, the use of soffa in Arabic to mean a sofa (found in Bocthor's dictionary in the early 19th century) was a post-medieval development and perhaps started in Turkish. The following are depictions of Turkish sofas painted in the early 18th century in Turkey: Sofa--1, Sofa--2, Sofa--3, Sofa-- 4. The year 1680 Turkish-Arabic-Persian-Latin Dictionary of Mesgnien-Meninski defined صفّة soffa in both Turkish and Arabic in the same way as what is depicted in those paintings, and defined it as a porch also – ref. ;spinach : إسبناخ isbinākh in Andalusian Arabic, and إِسفاناخ isfānākh in medieval Arabic but, the main word for it is سبانخ. more generally, from Persian aspanākh, spinach. \\"The spinach plant was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. It was the Arabs who introduced the spinach into Spain, whence it spread to the rest of Europe,\\"The quote is from the etymology dictionary by Lammens year 1890. The spinach plant is on record in Latin Europe from the 12th century onward (see e.g. CNRTL.fr). The oldest written evidence for people eating spinach anywhere in the world comes from the 7th century AD in China; and Chinese sources indicate the plant came to China from Iran – Sino-Iranica... with special reference to the history of cultivated plants, by Berthold Laufer, year 1919, pages 392-398. A subspecies of spinach has been found growing in the wild in northern Iran and is thought to occur natively there; and the cultivation of spinach is thought to have originated in Iran not long before the Islamic conquest of Iran – Origin of Cultivated Plants, by Alphonse De Candolle, year 1885, pages 98-100. and the same is true of the name as well.A 12th-century Andalusian Arab called Ibn Hisham Al-Lakhmi called spinach isbinākh and another Andalusian Arab source spelled it asbinākh – A Dictionary of Andalusi Arabic (year 1997). That Andalusian Arabic wordform is phonetically close to the medieval Catalan and Spanish form espinac  espinaca, and the medieval French forms espinache, espinage, espinoche, espinace, and similar forms – CNRTL.fr, DMF, Godefroy, MED, Diccionari.cat. At Baghdad in the 10th century cookbook of Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, the word for spinach is spelled isfanākh – ref. The form isfānākh is on record in Arabic from the late 9th century, which is nearly three centuries before a record of spinach in a Western language. In a Western language the first known records of the plant under any name are in the 12th century in Provençal (CNRTL.fr) and Catalan (Diccionari.cat). The first records in English are around year 1400. ;sugar, sucrose, sucrase: سكّر sukkar, sugar. The word is ultimately from Sanskritic sharkara = \\"sugar\\". Cane sugar developed in ancient India originally. It was produced by the medieval Arabs on a pretty extensive scale although it always remained expensive throughout the medieval era. History of sugar. Among the earliest records in England are these entries in the account books of an Anglo-Norman abbey in Durham: year 1302 \\"Zuker Marok\\", 1309 \\"succre marrokes\\", 1310 \\"Couker de Marrok\\", 1316 \\"Zucar de Cypr[us]\\".\\"Sugar\\" in the Middle English Dictionary. \\"Marrok\\" meant Morocco – that is clear from elsewhere in the same dictionary. In Latin the early records are about year 1100 spelled zucharum and zucrum.Spellings of the word for sugar in later- medieval Latin included sucrum, succarum, sucharum, sucarium, succurum, zucrum, zucara, zuccarum, zuchar, zucharum, zuccura, zucurium – Du Cange. Those are Latinizations of oral Romance speech. Of the early records in Latin, the earliest is in the Arabic-to-Latin medical translator Constantinus Africanus (died c. 1087). Constantinus has the word a dozen times in his Theorica Pantegni, which on the whole is a translation of a medical book of 'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi (died c. 990). A manuscript of Theorica Pantegni dated 3rd quarter of the 12th century as a physical manuscript spells it zucharum  zucharo – Codex EÖ.II.14. Another of the early Latin records is zucra about 1125 in the Crusades chronicle Historia Hierosolymitanae expeditionis (\\"History of the Expedition to Jerusalem\\") by Albert of Aachen. The ancient Greeks & Romans knew sugar as an import from India, and they used it as a medicine, not as a food. Ancient Greek sakcharon and classical Latin saccharum meant \\"sugar\\" (examples from ancient writers). No historical continuity exists between the classical Latin saccharum and the later-medieval Latin zuccharum  sucharum, and nobody nowadays contends that saccharum (with its letter 'a') was the ancestor of zuccharum  sucharum (with its letter 'u'). Instead, etymology dictionaries are longstandingly unanimous that the Arabic sukkar was the parent of the later-medieval Latin word. On the other hand, modern English \\"saccharin\\" and \\"saccharide\\" were created as scientific terms as modern borrowings of the ancient saccharum – New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. The Latin form sucrum or the French form sucre = \\"sugar\\" produced the modern chemistry terms sucrose and sucrase. ;sultan, sultana : سلطان sultān, authority, ruler. The first ruler to use Sultan as a formal title was an Islamic Turkic-speaking ruler in Central Asia in the 11th century. He borrowed the word from Arabic.Quote: \\"Sultān in Arabic is an abstract noun, meaning authority and rule, and was used from early times to denote the government.... It first became official in the eleventh century, when the Seljuks adopted it as their chief regnal title.\\" – ref. The Seljuk ruler Tughril Beg proclaimed himself al-Sultān in 1038 – ref. In Arabic grammar سلطانة sultāna is the feminine of sultān. Caliph, emir, qadi, and vizier are other Arabic-origin words connected with rulers.Their use in English is mostly confined to discussions of Middle Eastern history. ;sumac: سمّاق summāq, sumac species of shrub or its fruit (Rhus coriaria). Anciently and medievally, different components of the sumac were used in leather making, in dyeing, and in medicine. The Arabic geography writer Al-Muqaddasi (died circa 1000) mentions summāq as one of the commercial crops of Syria.Extracts from Al-Muqaddasi's late-10th-century Description of Syria in English translation are at Ref. Summāq is in the \\"Commerce\\" section. This was noted by Henri Lammens, year 1890, citing the Arabic text of Al-Muqaddasi. Lammens also cites a couple of other medieval Arabic geography writers who used the word. Summāq can be cited from many medieval Arabic medicine writers, as it was commonly used in medicaments. Sumac was called rhus in Latin in the classical and early medieval periods. In the late medieval period sumac became the predominant name in Latin. The Arabic name is found in Latin starting in the 10th century and as such it is one of the earliest loanwords on this list.Ambergris, Azure, Camphor and Galangal have 9th-century Latin records; www.CNRTL.fr. Those are the earliest. From the Latin, the word is in late medieval English medical books spelled sumac. ;Swahili : سواحل sawāhil, coasts (plural of sāhil, coast). Historically Swahili was the language used in commerce along the east coast of Africa, along 2000 kilometers of coast. Swahili is grammatically a Bantu language, with about one-third of its vocabulary taken from Arabic.Swahili-to-English Dictionary, with etymologies for the Swahili words, compiled by Andras Rajki, year 2005, containing 2000 words. ;syrup, sherbet, sorbet : شراب sharāb, a word with two senses in Arabic, \\"a drink\\" and \\"syrup\\". Medieval Arabic medical writers used it to mean a medicinal syrup, and this was passed into Latin in the late 11th century as siropus  siruppus  syrupus with the same meaning. Constantinus Africanus (died c. 1087), who was fluent in Arabic, is the author of the earliest known records in Latin. The change from sound /sh/ to sound /s/ in going from sharāb to siroppus reflects the fact that Latin phonology did not use an /sh/ sound ever. The -us of siroppus is a carrier of Latin grammar and nothing more. In late medieval Europe a sirup was usually medicinal.The Arabic medical writer Ibn Sina (died 1037) called syrup sharāb and has dozens of different syrups in his Book V, Treatise 6: On potions and thickened juices. The medical writer Najm al-Din Mahmud (died 1330) has another set of dozens of recipes for viscous sharāb for medical purposes, where fruit juices are boiled to reduce water by evaporation, and sugar is added – ref (in Arabic and French). \\"Sharāb... is very common in [old] Arabic medical writings\\", says Reinhart Dozy year 1869. Some comments on the use of syrups among the medieval Arabs are in the book Food and Foodways of Medieval Cairenes, year 2011 pages 461-464. In Latin, the word is in the Arabic-to-Latin medical translator Constantinus Africanus (died c. 1087) with the early surviving copies of his work spelling it variously syrop_  sirop_  sirup_ – ref, ref. No records pre-dating Constantinus Africanus are known in Latin. In the 12th century in Latin, siropus  sirupus  syropus  syrupus is frequent in the works of the Salernitan school of medicine (ref), whose ways of doing medicine were much influenced by Constantinus Africanus. The word is frequent in the Arabic-to- Latin medical translations of the translator Gerard of Cremona (died c. 1187) (examples). In late medieval western Europe, \\"syrup\\" usually meant a medicinal syrup (sugar + liquid + medicine) – that is well documented for 15th-century English in the Middle English Dictionary and is evident in the entry for sirop in the Dictionary of late medieval French. Separately from syrup, in the 16th century the same Arabic rootword re-entered Western European languages from Turkish. Turkish sherbet  shurbet = \\"a sweet lemonade\\" entered with that meaning into Italian and French as \\"sorbet\\" and directly into English as \\"sherbet\\". The Turkish was from the Arabic word-form شربة sharba(t). Addendum for words that may or may not be of Arabic ancestry ;racquet or racket (tennis) : Racquet with today's meaning has a late medieval start date. There are unanswered questions about its origin. French raquette (synonymous with Italian racchetta and English racquet) is widely reported as derived from medieval Latin rascete which meant the carpal bones of the wrist and the tarsal bones of the feet. The earliest records of this Latin anatomy word are in two 11th-century Latin medical texts, one of which was by the Arabic- speaking Constantinus Africanus who drew from Arabic medical sources, and surely he did take the anatomy word from Arabic. But there is no evidence to connect the anatomy word with the game word racquet. It would be a big leap in semantics to re-use the bones word as a word for a racquet. To warrant belief that this leap occurred, evidence would be necessary. Other etymology ideas try to connect racquet with other pre-existing words in late medieval Europe, but again with shortfalls in evidence.Most of today's English etymology dictionaries report that \\"racquet\\" is of Arabic ancestry, but they don't explain how. Some aspects of an origin in Arabic anatomy terminology are at CNRTL.fr. More historical info about the medieval anatomy word meaning the wrist bones and tarsal bones is at English Words Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #185. A minority of English dictionaries judge that there is not enough evidence from late medieval European writings to warrant belief that the word for the wrist bones generated the word for the racquet (e.g. NED, Corriente). Alternative etymologies are discussed at length in German in \\"Zur Herkunft von französisch raquette\\", by Christian Schmitt in Romania Arabica, year 1996, pages 47-55. ;scarlet : This word was in all Western European languages in the late medieval centuries. It first appears in European languages in Latin about year 1100 spelled scarlata. The early meaning was a costly, dense and smooth cloth made of wool. The cloth could be any color, but was usually dyed red. In the late medieval centuries the word took on the meaning of red color, concurrently with continued meaning as a high-quality woolen cloth. The origin of the word is an unsettled issue. No candidate parent word in Latin is known of. So an Arabic origin is possible. A specific Arabic source has been proposed, but the evidence for it is not good. A Germanic source has also been proposed and has been preferred by some historians of medieval textiles.The following is a 90-page essay in French arguing that the medieval Latin word scarlata (English scarlet) is of Germanic origin: Le Drap ESCARLATE au Moyen Age: Essai sur l'étymologie et la signification du mot écarlate et notes techniques sur la fabrication de ce drap de laine au moyen age, by J.-B. Weckerlin, year 1905. Weckerlin's argument has been endorsed by, e.g., Ref (in French) and Ref (in French). Weckerlin's argument has evidence gaps and leaves room for doubt. The following is a 7-page argument in English that scarlata came from Germanic. It agrees with Weckerlin's conclusion, and takes some of its information from Weckerlin, but mostly follows a different line of evidence: Ref (year 2015). The argument for a Germanic source has good plausibility, but again some room for doubt exists. The following is a 12-page argument that the medieval Latin word came from Arabic: \\"Ciclatoun Scarlet\\", by George Foot Moore, year 1913. In the 19th century it was often said that the medieval word scarlata had come from Persian. To the knowledge of people in the 19th century, there was no suitable parent word to be seen in Latin, Greek, Arabic, or Germanic, but there was one in Persian. However, researchers in the 20th century have rejected the idea that the European word could have come from Persian, and none of the above references lend any support to it, and the last two above go into reasons why it ought to be rejected. In continuation from the 19th century tradition, some dictionaries today still summarily say the word came from Persian (not Arabic); e.g. Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. Others of today's dictionaries say the medieval Latin word is \\"of unknown origin\\"; e.g. Collins English Dictionary. Others say the word came from Arabic (not Persian); e.g. Concise Oxford Dictionary. ;soda, sodium : Soda first appears in Western languages in late medieval Latin and Italian meaning the seaside plant Salsola soda and similar glasswort plants used to make soda ash for use in glassmaking, and simultaneously meaning soda ash itself. In medieval Catalan the name was sosa = \\"soda ash\\". Although of uncertain origin, an Arabic origin one way or another is considered likely by many reporters. It is most often said to be from Arabic سواد suwwād or سويدة suwayda, one or more species of glassworts whose ashes yielded soda ash, especially the species Suaeda vera. But that etymon suffers from a want of documentary evidence at a sufficiently early date. Also the Catalan form sosa is historically prior to the Italian form soda. A judgement that soda is \\"of unknown origin\\" is very defensible today.The etymology of the word \\"soda\\" is discussed in depth in German in the article \\"Soda\\" by Arnald Steiger in journal Vox Romanica year 1937 pages 53-76 (with main conclusions on pages 73-76). A review in English that takes information from Arnald Steiger's article is English Words That Are Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #186, Soda. The name \\"sodium\\" was derived from soda in the early 19th century.

English tabla is from Hindi/Urdu tabla, which is from Persian tabla = \\"small drum\\", Persian tabl = \\"drum\\", and Arabic tabl. The Persian is from the Arabic. Tabl in Arabic has been the usual word for drum (noun and verb) since the beginning of written records.Tabl = \\"drum\\" is a common word in medieval Arabic. As one reflection of that, in the 14th-century dictionary of Fairuzabadi, normal definitions of well-known words were given by the notation م denoting \\"well-known (definition unnecessary)\\", and طبل tabl was so given – Baheth.info. In Arabic dictionaries today, another written form of the noun is طبلة tabla. But that is not in medieval and early modern Arabic dictionaries. In some Urdu dictionaries, طبل tabl is one of the words for a drum – e.g. in [httpxact&display;=utf8 Platts' Urdu-English Dictionary year 1884]. ;tahini : طحينة tahīna, tahini. Derives from the Arabic verb for \\"grind\\" and is related to tahīn = \\"flour\\". The written Arabic tahīna is pronounced \\"taheeny\\" in Levantine Arabic. The word entered English directly from Levantine Arabic around year 1900, although tahini was rarely eaten in English-speaking countries until around 1970. Definition of tahini  Dictionary.com ;talc : طلق talq, mica and talc. Common in medieval Arabic. Documented in Latin alchemy from around 1200 onward, meaning mica and talc. Uncommon in the Latinate languages until the later 16th century. In all European languages today.Talq = \\"mica or talc\\" is in Arabic writings by Al-Jahiz (died 869), Yahya ibn Sarafyun (died before 900), Al-Razi (died circa 930), Al-Masudi (died 956), Ibn Sina (died 1037), a servant of emir Ibn Badis (died c. 1062), Ibn Al- Baitar (died 1248), and others – Ref, Ref, Ref (page 24 footnote #170). The word is in Latin in the early 13th century in two alchemy books that were translated and derived from Arabic: the Liber de Aluminibus et Salibus and the Liber Luminis Luminum – Ref (section §69), Ref (appendix III). The influential Latin alchemist Pseudo-Geber, who was influenced by Arabic literature, used the word in Latin around 1300 spelled talc  talck  talk in Latin. He was not the only late medieval Latin alchemist who used it. Late medieval Latin alchemy examples are at Ref, Ref, Ref. Latin talk is also in the medical book of Ibn Sina in late 12th century Arabic-to-Latin translation (Ref). But the word is uncommon in late medieval Latin (e.g. it is not in the extensive medieval Latin glossaries of Du Cange and Niermeyer) and the earliest known attestations in the vernacular Western languages come relatively late: Spanish = 1492, German = 1526, Italian = 1550, French = 1553, English talcum = 1558, English talc = 1582 – Ref, ref, ref. The writings of Paracelsus (died 1541) increased the circulation of the word in 16th-century Europe. The 16th century Latin talk  talcum meant mica and talc (e.g.), (e.g.). Definition of talc  Dictionary.com ;talisman: طلسم tilsam  tilasm, talisman. The Arabic came from Late Greek telesma = \\"consecration rite\\". Medievally in Arabic and Syriac it was used in the sense of \\"incantation\\" sometimes. Al-Masudi (died 956) and Ibn al-Awwam (died c. 1200) are examples of Arabic writers who used the word in the sense of an astrology-based talisman. An 11th-century, 400-page Arabic book about occult magic, astrology and talismans, the book entitled the Ghāyat al-Hakīm, uses the word about 200 times in the sense of a talisman, meaning an image with talismanic powers created through the guidance of astrology. The word entered astrology in the West with this meaning in the early 17th century, beginning in French. Early users in French said the word came from Arabic.\\"Talisman\\" with roughly today's meaning is first recorded in French in 1592 (CNRTL.fr), in English in 1638 (NED). The word with the same meaning is in today's Italian and Spanish and arrived there from French (as reported by today's Italian and Spanish etymology dictionaries). In the Western languages for three centuries before 1638 and continuing for a while after, a \\"talismani\\" meant an Islamic prayer leader or mullah, as documented in Yule & Burnell (page 893). With regard to \\"talisman\\" with roughly today's meaning, this meaning is found in French in Joseph Scaliger in 1590s, Jacques Gaffarel in the 1620s, and Charles Sorel in the 1630s, and the more exact meaning they have for the word is an astrology-based constructed image serving as an amulet, and those three writers say the word with this meaning has come from the Arabic language. More details on the history of the word are at English Words That Are Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #137: Talisman. Definition of talisman  Dictionary.com ;tamarind : تمر هندي tamr hindī (literally: \\"Indian date\\"), tamarind. Tamarinds were in use in ancient India. They were not known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. They entered medieval Latin medical practice from Arabic. In English the early records are in translations of Latin medical texts. Tamarind's medieval medical uses were various.In Latin, tamarindi occurs in the later 11th century in the Arabic-to- Latin medical translator Constantinus Africanus (ref), and the word is frequent in the writings of the 12th and 13th century medical school at Salerno in southern Italy (collected in the five-volume set Collectio Salernitana). It entered late medieval English in medical books that were influenced by the Salernitan school (see the Middle English Dictionary). In Arabic, the book on medicaments by Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) gives brief summaries of the statements of a handful of medieval Arabic medical writers about tamr hindī – ref: pages 166–167. One of the people quoted by Ibn al- Baitar says the tamarind \\"grows in Yemen and India and Central Africa [Bilād al-Sūdān]\\". The tamarind has a large number of different names spread across the languages of Central Africa, and the tree is evidently native in Central Africa. Nevertheless Arabic medicine got introduced to the tamarind from India. Another one of the medieval commentators quoted by Ibn al-Baitar says the tamarind is used as a cuisine item in Oman. That is surely true, but other evidence indicates that tamarind's use as a cuisine item was rare among the medieval Arabs (ref, ref, ref), though it was not rare in medieval India (ref). The most commonly recorded use of the tamarind among the medieval Arabs and Latins was as a laxative (see the medical books just referenced, including Ibn al-Baitar's). Definition of tamarind  Dictionary.com ;tanbur, tanbura, tambur, tambura, tambouras, tamburica, tembûr : These are all long-necked plucked string musical instruments. From Arabic طنبور ṭunbūr (also ṭanbūr), long-necked plucked string instrument. The word occurs early and often in medieval Arabic. It was also in use in Early Medieval Aramaic.Early Medieval Aramaic has ṭnbwr = \\"long-necked string instrument\\", with records in the Syriac and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic dialects. Aramaic writing systems omit short vowels, so ṭnbwr may be read as tanbawr  tunboūr  etc. – Tnbwr @ Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon . An Arabic writer who wrote at length about the tunbūr was Al-Farabi (died 950). A 17-page extract from Al-Farabi about the tunbūr is online in Arabic in Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference of Orientalists meeting in Leiden year 1883. The records for the word tunbur  tanbur are many centuries older in Arabic and Aramaic than in Persian. In Persian the very old word for a long-necked string instrument was tar and dotar and setar – Dictionary of Music by Willi Apel, year 1969, entry under \\"Lute II\\".

The English word \\"tang\\" meaning piquant flavour was also in English before \\"tangerine\\" the orange. Incidentally, Morocco today is one of the world's biggest exporters of fresh tangerine and mandarin oranges, with the exports mostly in the form called clementine, which is a variety of tangerine with no seeds and a less tangy taste. Tangier is not one of the main export ports – ref. The Arabic name for a tangerine is unrelated. The city existed in pre-Arabic times named \\"Tingi\\".

Medieval Arabic tarh  tarha was also used meaning \\"a deduction, a subtraction\\".Supplement aux Dictionnaires Arabes, by Reinhart Dozy, volume 2, year 1881. The tare weight is defined in English as the weight of a package that's empty. To get the net weight of goods in a package, you weigh the goods in their package, which is the gross weight, and then discard the tare weight. Catalan tara dates from 1271,www.Diccionari.cat (in Catalan). French tare 1311, Italian tara 1332,More details at CNRTL.fr Etymologie in French language. This site is a division of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. England tare 1380.The first record of \\"tare\\" in England, recorded 1380, is in Anglo-Norman French in London; and the first pure English record for \\"tare\\" is in 1429 as per the MED. Later records are cited in the NED. The word has a record in Spanish around 1400 in the form atara, which helps affirm Arabic ancestry because the leading 'a' in atara represents the Arabic definite article.Glossaire des mots espagnols et portugais dérivés de l'arabe by R. Dozy & W.H. Engelmann, year 1869, on page 313. In Arabic, where tarha = \\"a discard\\", al-tarha = \\"the discard\\". The written al-tarha is always pronounced \\"at-tarha\\" (see pronunciation of al- in Arabic). At-tarha transfers into medieval Spanish as atara. However, the word's early records among the Latins are as tara in Catalan and Italian, and it arrived in those languages from Mediterranean sea-commerce, and it did not arrive there from Spanish nor from the Arabic of Iberia. The record of atara in Spanish about 1410 is in the collection of poems Cancionero de Baena which is a kind of document that is different from the commerce documents having the word in the other Latinate languages. The word, as atara or tara, is otherwise very rare in medieval Spanish. From the chronology of attestations, it is highly likely that the Modern Spanish tara did not come from Iberian Arabic, and instead it came from the Catalan and Italian word. A good example of the word in medieval Italian commerce is Pegolotti's Mercatura in 1340, which has tara 190 times meaning the tare on merchandise – Ref. The Spanish atara of 1410 looks an isolated and exceptional record – this point about atara is made in Los Arabismos del Castellano en la Baja Edad Media, by Felipe Maíllo Salgado, 3rd edition 1998, on page 359. It is spelled tara in today's Spanish, Italian, German, and Russian. Definition of tare  Dictionary.com ;tariff : تعريف taʿrīf, notification, specification (from ʿarraf, to notify). The word was widely used in medieval Arabic and meant any kind of notification or specification.A number of large dictionaries were written in Arabic during medieval times. Searchable copies of nearly all of the main medieval Arabic dictionaries are online at Baheth.info and/or AlWaraq.net. One of the most esteemed of the dictionaries is Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari's \\"Al-Sihah\\" which is dated around and shortly after year 1000. The biggest is Ibn Manzur's \\"Lisan Al- Arab\\" which is dated 1290 but most of its contents were taken from a variety of earlier sources, including 9th- and 10th-century sources. Often Ibn Manzur names his source then quotes from it. Therefore, if the reader recognizes the name of Ibn Manzur's source, a date considerably earlier than 1290 can often be assigned to what is said. A list giving the year of death of a number of individuals who Ibn Manzur quotes from is in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, volume 1, page xxx (year 1863). Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon contains much of the main contents of the medieval Arabic dictionaries in English translation. At AlWaraq.net, in addition to searchable copies of medieval Arabic dictionaries, there are searchable copies of a large number of medieval Arabic texts on various subjects. Among the Latins the word starts in late medieval commerce on the Mediterranean Sea where it meant a tabular statement of inventory on a merchant ship (bill of lading) or any tabular statement of products and prices offered for sale. In use by Italian and Catalan merchants in the 14th century. Entered French and English in the 16th as a tabular statement. In Spanish the word is absent or very rare before the late 17th.Catalan tarifa is first recorded in 1315 – Diccionari.cat. Italian tariffa 1358, and French tariffe 1572 – CNRTL.fr. Spanish tarifa 1680 – Raja Tazi 1998 citing Corominas (1954). From the meaning of a tabular statement of import tax liabilities on different goods, the meaning of an import tax grew out by metonymy. Definition of tariff  Dictionary.com ;tarragon (herb) : طرخون tarkhūn, tarragon. The word with that meaning was used by Ibn Al-Baitar (died 1248), who gives a description of the plant and mentions both culinary and medical uses. Tarkhūn comes up in a medical context in Al-Razi (died circa 930), and in a culinary context in Ibn al-Awwam (died circa 1200).Ibn al- Baitar's 13th century Book of Simple Medicaments and Foods is online in Arabic (5 megabytes; PDF) (tarkhūn on page 558), and in German translation (year 1842, tarkhūn in volume 2-page 156). The book was compiled in the 1240s. It says طرخون tarkhūn is a herb that grows to a height of between a handspan and a forearm tall, has long narrow delicate leaves, and has \\"camphor-like\\" aromatic qualities, and the leaves can be dined on at table mixed with mint and other herbs, but when chewed in quantity it causes a numbing effect in the mouth. Ibn al-Baitar gives excerpts from ten medieval Arabic commentators about the plant. The commentators are not totally consistent with each other in what they have to say, and some of them are exclusively interested in the medical utility of the numbing effect. Ibn Al-Baitar himself says tarkhūn is \\"a herb well-known among the people of the Levant\\". More than three centuries later, in the 1570s, a German visitor to the Levant, the physician and botanist Leonhard Rauwolff, observed that the local inhabitants of Lebanon used tarragon culinarily and they called it \\"Tarchon\\" – Der Raiß inn die Morgenländer, year 1582 page 24. Ibn al-Awwam in 12th century southern Iberia has طرخون tarkhūn listed together with mint, chicory-endive, rocket (arugula), basil, parsley, chard, and a few other small leafy plants of an ordinary vegetable garden – Ref. In later-medieval Latin (late 12th century onward) it comes up in a medicine context spelled altarcon, tarchon and tragonia and was acknowledged at the time to be from Arabic. Until then in Latin there is no record of the plant under any name, or at least no clear record. Records for Italian tarcone  targone, French targon  tragon, Spanish taragoncia  traguncia, English tarragon and German Tragon all start in the 16th century and all are in a culinary context.See \\"tarragon\\" in the NED (year 1919). One of the things noted by the NED is that an English botany book explaining Latin names in English in 1548 said: \\"[Latin] Tarchon... is called with us [English] Tarragon\\". A late-13th-century Latin medical dictionary, \\"Synonyma Medicinae\\" by Simon of Genoa, spelled it both tarcon and tarchon and defined the plant solely by saying what was written about it by the Arabic medical writer Avicenna. Early records of the tarragon plant in Italian include among others 1541 targone in Pietro Aretino, 1546 targon in Luigi Alamanni, and 1576 dragone in Bartolomeo Boldo. Italian tarcone + taracone = \\"tarragon\\" is in John Florio's year 1611 Italian-to-English Dictionary. The earliest known in French is 1539 targon – CNRTL.fr. Late 16th century French has the wordforms targon  tragon  estargon  estragon = \\"tarragon\\", where the prefix es- seems merely prosthetic. In the 18th century, the etymology writer Jacob Le Duchat and others believed in the idea that the word had arisen within the Latinate languages as a mutant of the classical Latin draco[n] = \\"dragon\\", an idea which they supported with the fact that some botanicals have been called dragonwort, Dracunculus and suchlike in Europe going back uninterruptedly to ancient Greek and Roman times. No one believes in that idea today. \\"It would be the sole example of Latin dr becoming tr in French.\\" – Marcel Devic, year 1876. The Italian dragone = \\"tarragon\\" is a mutant of the Italian targone = \\"tarragon\\" in the judgement of numerous commentators, including Ottorino Pianigiani, year 1926. Definition of tarragon  Dictionary.com ;tazza (cup), demi-tasse : طسّ tass  طاسة tāsa  طسّة tassa, round shallow cup or bowl, which was made of metal, typically made of brass. The word has been in all the western Latinate languages since the 13th and 14th centuries. Medievally the Latinate tasse  taza  taça (ç = z) was very often made of silver and was in the luxury category.For the word in medieval French see tasse @ Dictionnaire du Moyen Français 1330-1500. For medieval Spanish see taça @ Corpus Diacrónico del Español (note medieval Spanish plata meant silver). For the word in medieval Latin see Du Cange under the spellings tacia, tassia #1, tassa #2 and taxea #2. The word was common in Arabic for many centuries before it shows up in the Latinate languages. English had it as tass in the 16th century, which continued much later in colloquial use in Scotland, but today's English tazza and demitasse came from Italian and French in the 19th century. Definition of tazza  Dictionary.com = traffic = :from Arabic tafriq \\"distribution.\\" Meaning \\"people and vehicles coming and going\\" ;tuna : التنّ al-tunn, tunafish. The standard etymology report is: Ancient Greek and classical Latin thunnus = \\"tunafish\\" -> medieval Arabic al-tunn (or al-tūn) -> medieval Spanish atún -> colloquial American Spanish tuna -> late 19th century California tuna -> international English. Note: Modern Italian tonno, French thon, and English tunny, each meaning tuna, are descended from the classical Latin without an Arabic intermediary. Note: Isidore of Seville (died 636, lived in southern Spain) spelled it thynnus in Latin, where the Latin letter 'y' in Isidore's case was likely pronounced \\"eu\\", roughly like in British \\"tuna\\", which was roughly how the letter 'y' was pronounced in classical Latin.Classical Latin borrowed the letter Y from Greek in the 1st century BC to represent the Greek letter Υ, which in Greek was pronounced approximately \\"eu\\" (/ü/). Up until the 1st century BC, Latin borrowings from Greek had used the Latin letter U to represent this Greek sound. The Latin letter Y in its early history was pronounced in the same way as the Greek letter Υ. The Latin that survives from Spain from the era of Isidore of Seville, including the output of Isidore himself, preserves classical usages, in general. Thynni (the plural of thynnus) is in Isidore of Seville's Origines Book XII paragraph 6 (in Latin). Note: The word was common in ancient Greek and Latin; and common in late medieval Spanish; but a rarity in medieval Arabic, and it is not listed in medieval Arabic dictionaries.Records of the use of the word in ancient Greek, classical Latin, medieval Arabic, and medieval Spanish are reviewed at English words of Arabic ancestry: Note #190: Tunafish (this review of the documentary evidence concludes that \\"it is uncertain and debatable whether the word tuna can be claimed to be of Arabic ancestry or not\\"). Definition of tuna  Dictionary.com. The Albacore species of tunafish got its name from 16th century Spanish & Portuguese albacora, which might be from Arabic, although there is no clear precedent in Arabic.The earliest records of the albacora tunafish name are in 16th-century Spanish and Portuguese. The origin of the name is obscure according to the Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española – albacora #2 @ Diccionario RAE. Old Arabic dictionaries do not contain a phonetically similar word with the meaning of a fish – ref: Dozy (year 1869, pages 61 & 388). Albacore tuna flesh is white when cooked and is a lighter shade of red when raw when compared to other tunas. \\"Alba\\" is a classical Latin and old Spanish & Portuguese word for white (e.g. English albino is borrowed from Portuguese); and the Portuguese word for color is \\"cor\\". Hence albacora may have been created in Portuguese meaning \\"white color\\" [tuna meat] – that is the judgement of the Portuguese and Arabic expert :pt:José Pedro Machado. But there is uncertainty because the Portuguese word did not have the exclusive meaning of albacore tuna; it could also designate the yellowfin tuna. In today's Portuguese the bluefin tuna is often called atum vermelho, literally \\"red tuna\\", referring to its red flesh when raw. In Spanish, atún rojo, literally \\"red tuna\\", is a frequently used name for the bluefin tuna. In Spanish, atún blanco, literally \\"white tuna\\", is a frequently used name for the albacore tuna; it is synonymous with Spanish albacora. Again, the names refer to the color of the flesh. Another consideration is the 16th century start date of the Spanish and Portuguese word albacora. Spanish & Portuguese had stopped borrowing words from Arabic well before the 16th century. Of the words they had borrowed from Arabic in the earlier centuries, the large majority of those in use today are found in writing before the 16th century. A small minority, borrowed well before the 16th century, do not show up in writing until the 16th century. The lateness of the start date of albacora makes it less likely that albacora came from Arabic. Definition of albacore  Dictionary.com. In the tuna family the Bonito is another commercial fish species whose name comes from Spanish. The name is in late medieval Spanish, and it might have got there from Arabic, or might not.Bonítol is a commercially caught bonito-type fish in Catalan records in 1313, 1361, 1365, 1370 and later – \\"Una llista de peixos valencians de Mariano Bru\\" by Antoni Corcoll in Estudis de Llengua i Literatura Catalanes, Volume XL, year 2000, pages 21 - 22. The terminal letter L in Catalan bonítol is a diminutive (similarly, Catalan fillol = \\"godson\\" is from Catalan fill = \\"son\\" and classical Latin formula is from Latin forma = \\"form\\"). Some dictionaries report the name bonito may be a Spanish-ization of بينيث baynīth which is a sea fish in medieval Arabic general dictionaries (including Lisan al-Arab); others report the name's origin is unknown or may be from Spanish bonito = \\"pretty good\\".

The Arabic page with the term \\"samt al-rā's\\" is here and the translator has a note about it in Latin here. and Al-Battani (died 929), both of whom were translated to Latin in the 12th century. From its use in astronomy in Arabic, the term was borrowed into astronomy in Latin in the 12th century. The first-known securely-dated record in the Western languages is in the Arabic-to-Latin translation of Al-Battani.Al-Battani's Kitāb Al-Zīj was translated to Latin around 1140. The translator was Plato Tiburtinus. In the translation, Al-Battani's Arabic samt al-rā's = \\"top direction\\" was written down in Latin as zenith capitis and zenith capitum. The Latin capitis  capitum = \\"head (or top)\\" is a straight translation of Arabic rā's = \\"head (or top)\\". Today's etymology dictionaries are unanimous that the Latin zenith was a mangling of Arabic samt = \\"direction\\". In the same book translated by Plato Tiburtinus, Arabic سمت مطلع samt motalaa = \\"direction to the rising sun\\" was translated as Latin zenith ascensionis (chapter 7); قد تعرف السمت qad taarif al-samt = \\"the direction can be made known by\\" was translated as zenith sciri potest (chapter 11); سمت الجنوب samt al-janoub = \\"southern direction\\" was translated as zenith meridianum (chapter 12) (where medieval Latin meridianus meant \\"southern\\" and \\"midday\\"). In other words, for Plato Tiburtinus zenith meant \\"direction\\" and did not mean \\"zenith\\". But the direction that was used the most was the samt al-rā's = zenith capitis = \\"top direction; vertically up\\". The phrase zenith capitis or zenith capitum meaning \\"vertically up, zenithal direction\\" occurs in medieval Latin in Johannes de Sacrobosco (died circa 1245) (Ref), Roger Bacon (died 1294) (Ref), Albertus Magnus (died 1280) (Ref), and others. Later writers dropped the capitis and used zenith alone to mean the zenith capitis. Refs: zenith at CNRTL.fr; zenith in Brill's Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1st Edition; zenith capitis and zenith capitum in Plato Tiburtinus in Latin; سمت الرأس samt al-ra's in Al-Battani's book in Arabic .

Crossref the word nadir, whose first record in the West is in the very same Arabic-to-Latin translation. ;zero : صفر sifr, zero. The use of zero as one of the elementary digits was the Hindu-Arabic numeral system's key innovation. Medieval Arabic sifr -> Latin zephirum = \\"zero\\" (used in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa, who was one of the early Latin adopters of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system) -> Old Italian zefiro (used by Piero Borgi in the 1480s)The Introduction and Spread of the Hindu-Arabic Numerals, by Smith and Karpinski, year 1911, pages 57 to 60: Online. -> contracted to zero in Old Italian before 1485 -> French zéro 1485 -> English zero 1604; rare in English before 1800.Nathan Bailey's English Dictionary in year 1726 defined zero as \\"a word used for cypher or nought especially by the French\\" – ref. Samuel Johnson's English Dictionary in 1755 and 1785 did not include the word zero at all. The usual names for zero in English from the late medieval period until well into the 19th century were \\"nought\\" and \\"cifre\\"  \\"cipher\\" – ref1a, ref1b, ref2a, ref2b, ref3. Crossref cipher. Addendum for words that may or may not be of Arabic ancestry ;tambourine : English tambourine is from French tambourin = \\"small drum\\" (15th century), which is from French tambour = \\"drum\\" (14th century), which is from French tabour = \\"drum\\" (13th century), which is from French tabor  tabur = \\"military drum used by Muslim armies\\" (12th century). Which is probably from Arabic طبول taboul = \\"military drums, and any drums\\". Military drums were not in use in French armies at the time when the word emerged in French in the 12th century as a military drum. Most of the early records in French are in a genre of military-legend ballads known as chansons de geste in which war-drums are pounded by the enemy side only, and the enemy is non-Christian, usually Muslim. First record in French is in the war ballad Chanson de Roland about 1100, featuring a Muslim enemy. Muslim armies standardly used drums from the 10th century onward and taboul is the usual word for drums in Arabic since the beginning of written records. In evaluating this etymology, different people have expressed different views about the prior probability of the phonetic change involved in the step from taboul to tabour.Discussed at length at English words of Arabic ancestry: Note #140: Tambour (drum), Tambourine. ;tartar (a chemical), tartrates (chemicals), tartaric acid : Early records of tartar as a chemical name in Latin are in the mid-12th century in the medical books of the Salernitan school of medicine in southern Italy, spelled tartarum, designating a substance that consisted mainly of what is now called potassium bitartrate.Details at English Words That Are Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #187. The ancient Greeks and Romans used this substance, including in medicine (e.g. Dioscorides in Greek in the 1st century AD called it truxThe Materia Medica of Dioscorides is downloadable from links on the wikipedia Dioscorides page. Trux meaning \\"tartar\\" is in Dioscorides' Book 5, where Dioscorides briefly describes how to make it and how to use it in medicine.). The name tartar is not in classical Latin or Greek in any chemical sense, although there was a classical mythological hell called Tartarus. The origin of the medieval Latin name is obscure. A parent in Arabic has been speculatively suggested by a number of dictionaries. A parent in Byzantine Greek is also speculated. ;tobacco: The English word comes from Spanish tabaco. Most of today's English dictionaries derive the Spanish word from the Amerindian language of Haiti. But most of today's Spanish dictionaries derive it from a late medieval Spanish plantname that they say came from a medieval Arabic plantname. The question is unsettled.A number of reports in Spanish in the 16th century clearly say the word tabaco is indigenous to the West Indies – CNRTL.fr. According to the same and other reports at the time, there were a number of indigenous names for tobacco in the West Indies and tabaco was not one of those names strictly speaking, and the reporters are in conflict about what the indigenous name tabaco meant, and they are writing after tobaco had already been established in Spanish in the New World – NED. In the opinion of Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana (year 1954), the Spanish tabaco is a word of Arabic ancestry; and this opinion has since been endorsed by Diccionari.cat (2007) and Diccionario RAE (2014). A medieval Arabic plantname طبّاق tubbāq is well documented in medieval Arabic; e.g. in Ibn al-Baitar c. 1245 and medieval Arabic dictionaries. But connecting this or any Arabic word to the Spanish tabaco = \\"tobacco\\" is poorly documented in Spanish. ;traffic: This word, which is in the great majority of European languages today, is seen earliest in early 14th-century Italian. Records from the port of Pisa in the 1320s have noun traffico and verb trafficare.\\"Traffic\\" in NED (1926). The early meaning was \\"bringing merchandise to a distant selling market\\", more often than not by sea, \\"commerce, especially long-distance commerce\\". The origin is obscure: various propositions have been aired from Latinate and Arabic sources but none convincingly. The following are Arabic-descended words in English that got established in later medieval Latinate commerce on the Mediterranean Sea with start dates in Italian (also Catalan) earlier than Spanish or Portuguese: arsenal, average, carat, garble, magazine, sequin, tare (weight), and tariff. In view of those borrowings, and because \\"traffic\\" lacks a convincing derivation from Latin, an Arabic source for \\"traffic\\" is a possibility. ;zircon, zirconium : English and French zircon are from German zirkon, which starts in German mineralogists and chemists in the 1780s meaning a zircon gemstone. The German zirkon is almost surely from the pre-existing Italian zargone, Italian giargone, French jargon, which in 18th century Italian and French was a jewellery word meaning zircon gemstones and zircon-like gemstones, in various colors.To show that German zirkon came from Italian zargone  giargone and French jargon, several pages of 18th century quotations are assembled at REF. The matter is beset by the presence of more than one small but noticeable phonetic irregularity in going from zargone  jargon to zirkon. For the phonetic reason, some etymology writers have taken the position that the source of the German zirkon is undetermined; e.g. Mettmann year 1962. But lots of later-18th-century documentation supports the position that its source was zargone. Zargone meaning zircon and zircon-like gemstones is in Italian books about gemstones; e.g. year 1682, year 1730, year 1785, year 1791. The German zirkon in its earliest known records, in the early 1780s, was identically synonymous with zargone  jargon; e.g. year 1780 in German. In the mid and late 1780s in German mineralogy literature, zirkon was narrowed and redefined to a specific species of zargone  jargon that came from Ceylon; e.g. year 1787, year 1789. The German zirkon in the late 1780s was a scientifically defined species of zargone  giargone  jargon. The mineralogists of Italy and France started adopting the German wordform around year 1800 because of its better mineralogical specificity. The Italian zargone  giargone and French jargon gemstone-name was descended from medieval French jargonce, medieval Italian giarconsia, medieval Spanish iargonça, medievally meaning zircon gemstones and zircon-like gemstones, in various colors.For the jargonce gemstone in medieval French (also jagonce) see Dictionnaire Étymologique de l'Ancien Français and Les Lapidaires Français du Moyen Age. For the same gemstone in medieval Spanish see iargonça  jargonça  girgonça  jagonça  jagonza in Corpus Diacrónico del Español. For the same gemstone in medieval Italian see giarconsia  giarconese  giagonzo in Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini. Late medieval French jargonce became post-medieval French jargons. A French-to-English translation in year 1699 mentions the jargon gemstone 14 times but always in the grammatical plural, \\"jargons\\" – Ref. In the famous French encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert, dated 1765, the name for the jargon gemstone is Jargons (not Jargon) – Ref, alt link. It is also in medieval French, Spanish and Italian as jagonce  jagonça  giagonzo with the same meaning. Jagonce was the parent of jargonce. The immediate source of medieval jagonce is not clear. It is demonstrably related to medieval Syriac yaqūndā, a gemstone with about the same meaning, but there is no known basis in Arabic for deriving jagonce from Arabic.Article on the etymology of the medieval French jagonce gemstone-name: \\"Altfranz. jagonce\\", by Hugo Schuchardt, year 1904 in journal Zeitschrift für romanische Philologie volume 28, pages 146-156. The medieval Syriac yaqūndā gemstone has a set of citations in Payne-Smith's Thesaurus Syriacus, year 1879 page 1622. Notes about the List Obsolete words and very rarely used non-technical words are not included in the list, but some specialist technical words are included. For example, the technical word \\"alidade\\" comes from the Arabic name for an ancient measuring device used to determine line-of-sight direction. Despite few English-speaking people being acquainted with it, the device's name remains part of the vocabulary of English-speaking surveyors, and today's instrument uses modern technology, and is included in the list. There are no words on the list where the transfer from Arabic to a Western language occurred before the ninth century AD; the earliest records of transfer are in ninth century Latin. Before then some words were transferred into Latin from Semitic sources (usually via Greek intermediation), including some that later ended up in English, but in most cases the Semitic source was not Arabic and in the rest of the cases it is impossible to know whether the Semitic source was Arabic or not. See List of English words of Semitic origin, excluding words known to be of Hebrew or Arabic origin. The list has been restricted to loan words: It excludes loan translations. Here's an example of a loan translation. In Arabic the words for father, mother and son are often used to denote relationships between things. Surrounding the brain and spinal chord is a tough outer layer of membrane called in today's English the dura mater. The words dura = \\"hard\\" and mater = \\"mother\\" are each in Latin from antiquity. Medieval Latin dura mater [cerebri], literally \\"hard mother [of the brain]\\" is a loan-translation of Arabic الأمّ الجافية al-umm al-jāfīa [al-dimāgh], literally \\"dry-husk mother [of the brain]\\" (a dry husk is a hard shell), and the translator in this case was Constantinus Africanus (died c. 1087).Constantinus Africanus has a 4-page chapter on the composition of the membranes situated on the interior of the skull. It is in Latin at Ref, and a variant Latin edition is at Ref. This was the place of birth of the term dura mater in Latin anatomy. Constantinus was fluent in Arabic and most of his overall content was taken from Arabic sources. For his material on dura mater, Constantinus's source was Ali Ibn Al-Abbas Al-Majusi, aka Haly Abbas (died c. 990). Details about how dura mater arose as an Arabic loan-translation are on pages 95-96 (including footnote #27) of the article \\"Constantine's pseudo- Classical terminology and its survival\\", by Gotthard Strohmaier in the book Constantine the African and ʻAlī Ibn Al-ʻAbbās Al-Maǧūsī: The Pantegni and Related Texts, year 1994. Constantinus's chapter with the term dura mater also contains the first known use of the term pia mater, which for Constantinus had the same meaning as it has today (i.e. a certain membrane lying between the brain and the skull), and this too was a loan-translation from Arabic – the term was al-umm al-raqīqa = \\"thin mother\\" in Ali Ibn Al-Abbas. Cf pia mater @ NED, pia mater @ CNRTL.fr. Early adopters of the names dura mater and pia mater include William of Conches (died c. 1154) and Roger Frugard (died c. 1195), both of whom took much material from Constantinus. As noted by Strohmaier (1994), the Greek medical writer Galen (died c. 200 AD) was acquainted with the dura mater and the pia mater, which he called in Greek sklera meninx (literally \\"hard membrane\\") and lepte meninx (literally \\"thin membrane\\"), also spelled μῆνιγξ. For the medieval Arabic writers on medicine including Ali Ibn Al-Abbas, the writings of Galen were the most quoted and requoted antecedent source for their knowledge of anatomy. For the early medieval Latins, the writings of Galen were mostly unknown and not in circulation – although a smallish subset was in circulation. The later- medieval Latins were introduced to more Galen from Arabic sources. Subsequently the Latins found more Galen in Late Byzantine sources. As another well-known example of a loan-translation, the word \\"sine\\"—as in sine, cosine and tangent—has its first record with that meaning in an Arabic-to-Latin book translation in the 12th century, translating Arabic jayb. Jayb had a second and quite unrelated meaning in Arabic that was translatable to Latin as sinus and the translator took up that connection to confer a new meaning to the Latin sinus, in preference to borrowing the foreign word jayb, and the translator was (probably) Gerard of Cremona (died c. 1187).Dictionary.Reference.com (2010), sinus#2 @ CNRTL.fr, and many others. The medieval Arabic جيب jayb in Lane's Arabic Lexicon page 492 can be compared for meaning against the classical Latin sinus in Lewis and Short's Dictionary of Classical Latin. About half of the loan-words on the list have their earliest record in a Western language in the 12th or 13th century. Some additional, unquantified number of terms were brought into the West in the 12th and 13th centuries by Arabic-to-Latin translators who used loan- translations in preference to loan-words. Some related information is at Translations from Arabic to Latin in the 12th century.

(page 60) Formal definition Let \\\\overline\\\\pi:\\\\overline Y\\\\to X be a vector bundle with a typical fiber a vector space \\\\overline F. An affine bundle modelled on a vector bundle \\\\overline\\\\pi:\\\\overline Y\\\\to X is a fiber bundle \\\\pi:Y\\\\to X whose typical fiber F is an affine space modelled on \\\\overline F so that the following conditions hold: (i) All the fiber Y_x of Y are affine spaces modelled over the corresponding fibers \\\\overline Y_x of a vector bundle \\\\overline Y. (ii) There is an affine bundle atlas of Y\\\\to X whose local trivializations morphisms and transition functions are affine isomorphisms. Dealing with affine bundles, one uses only affine bundle coordinates (x^\\\\mu,y^i) possessing affine transition functions : y'^i= A^i_j(x^ u)y^j + b^i(x^ u). There are the bundle morphisms : Y\\\\times_X\\\\overline Y\\\\longrightarrow Y,\\\\qquad (y^i, \\\\overline y^i)\\\\longmapsto y^i +\\\\overline y^i, :Y\\\\times_X Y\\\\longrightarrow \\\\overline Y,\\\\qquad (y^i, y'^i)\\\\longmapsto y^i - y'^i, where (\\\\overline y^i) are linear bundle coordinates on a vector bundle \\\\overline Y, possessing linear transition functions \\\\overline y'^i= A^i_j(x^ u)\\\\overline y^j . Properties An affine bundle has a global section, but in contrast with vector bundles, there is no canonical global section of an affine bundle. Let \\\\pi:Y\\\\to X be an affine bundle modelled on a vector bundle \\\\overline\\\\pi:\\\\overline Y\\\\to X. Every global section s of an affine bundle Y\\\\to X yields the bundle morphisms : Y i y\\\\to y-s(\\\\pi(y))\\\\in \\\\overline Y, \\\\qquad \\\\overline Y i \\\\overline y\\\\to s(\\\\pi(y))+\\\\overline y\\\\in Y. In particular, every vector bundle Y has a natural structure of an affine bundle due to these morphisms where s=0 is the canonical zero-valued section of Y. For instance, the tangent bundle TX of a manifold X naturally is an affine bundle. An affine bundle Y\\\\to X is a fiber bundle with a general affine structure group GA(m,\\\\mathbb R) of affine transformations of its typical fiber V of dimension m. This structure group always is reducible to a general linear group GL(m, \\\\mathbb R) , i.e., an affine bundle admits an atlas with linear transition functions. By a morphism of affine bundles is meant a bundle morphism \\\\Phi:Y\\\\to Y' whose restriction to each fiber of Y is an affine map. Every affine bundle morphism \\\\Phi:Y\\\\to Y' of an affine bundle Y modelled on a vector bundle \\\\overline Y to an affine bundle Y' modelled on a vector bundle \\\\overline Y' yields a unique linear bundle morphism : \\\\overline \\\\Phi: \\\\overline Y\\\\to \\\\overline Y', \\\\qquad \\\\overline y'^i= \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi^i}{\\\\partial y^j}\\\\overline y^j, called the linear derivative of \\\\Phi.

The story is set in an alternate modern day London which experiences an event called \\"the Problem\\", where ghosts appear throughout the city by nighttime and attack the living. Agencies have arisen to fend off the ghosts and protect the public, for a fee, but put themselves in extreme danger in the process. However, only children and teenagers have the \\"talent\\" to sense the ghosts; they gradually lose this once they reach their twenties. And so the agencies under with the leadership of people who have passed their ghost-sensitive ages and with the youth whose talents are instrumental in solving a haunting. All of the agencies but one. That one exception is Lockwood & Co. The story follows Lucy Carlyle and the agency of Lockwood & Co. The agency is run and led by Anthony Lockwood and has only one other member prior to Lucy's joining: a boy named George Cubbins. Using their different skills and \\"talents\\", they investigate and solve hauntings. As the series progresses, deeper mysteries unravel about the truths behind the ghosts and the Problem. Synopsis A sinister Problem has occurred in London: all nature of ghosts, haunts, and spectres are appearing throughout the city, and they are not exactly friendly. Only young people have the psychic abilities required to see and eradicate these unnatural foes. Many different Detection Agencies have cropped up to handle the dangerous work, and they are in fierce competition for business. In 'The Screaming Staircase', the plucky and talented Lucy Carlyle teams up with Anthony Lockwood, the charismatic leader of Lockwood & Co, a small agency that runs independent of any adult supervision. After an assignment leads to both a grisly discovery and a disastrous end, Lucy, Anthony, and their sarcastic colleague, George, are forced to take part in the perilous investigation of Combe Carey Hall, one of the most haunted houses in England. Will Lockwood & Co. survive the Hall's legendary Screaming Staircase and Red Room to see another day? Characters *Lucy Carlyle: The newest member of Lockwood & Co. and the narrator of the book, Lucy is 15 years old. and is described as quick to start a fight. She was known in earlier revisions as Lucy Purser. The daughter of a stationmaster in the North of England, she joined a local agency at an early age. However, after a disastrous case resulting in the loss of her fellow agents, Lucy left her former employment and family to start again in London. Lucy's Talent lies in her hearing and empathy through touch. *Anthony Lockwood: The leader of Lockwood & Co., often referred to as just Lockwood. He is described as \\"dashing\\" and \\"a bit reckless\\". His Talent is a sharp \\"sight\\" - seeing ghosts and deathglows, the psychic residue left by a violent death. Lockwood is known for his quick yet thorough approach to hauntings and prides himself on his abilities. He is a mysterious young man; orphaned and left with the family's property. *George Cubbins: Anthony's deputy, and quite cynical. He is rather portly and a little slovenly. George is much more focused on research and preparation than the other two agents, and prefers a longer waiting time between assignments. He rarely gets along with his fellow agent Lucy, however shares a strong passion with Anthony Lockwood. He is also quite attached to a skull in a glass jar which he owns. The skull is possessed by a ghost. *Suzie Martin: The daughter of Mrs. Hope, she meets Lockwood & Co. in her mother's absence, so they can investigate the presence of a Visitor in her family's home. She is quite sceptical of how young the agency is. *Annie Ward: A young woman who returns as a type-two ghost following her death. Lockwood & Co. encounter her at the beginning of the book, and then go on to solve the mystery of her murder. Her Source is a locket which Lockwood and Co. found around the neck of her corpse. Both she and Lucy share a strong psychic connection. *Inspector Barnes: An investigator of DEPRAC (Department of Psychical Research and Control), which is based at Scotland Yard. Barnes seems to disapprove of and possibly dislike Lockwood and George, however cooperates with them in the case of Annie Ward *Sir John William Fairfax: The wealthy industrialist who owns the haunted Combe Carey Hall, assigns Lockwood & Co. the mystery within the mansion and offers them the money needed to save the company from debt. *Hugo Blake: Annie Ward's 22-year-old boyfriend, who was accused of murdering Annie Ward. Sequels A sequel to the book, titled The Whispering Skull, was released in September 2014. A second sequel, titled The Hollow Boy, was released in September 2015. The fourth book in the series, The Creeping Shadow, was released in September 2016. The final book, The Empty Grave, was released in September 2017. Adaptations The film rights were acquired in December 2012 by Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures, making this the first live-action project for the former. The film, titled Lockwood & Co.: The Screaming Staircase, was to be produced by Illumination Entertainment CEO Chris Meledandri. However, in September 2017 it was announced that Big Talk Productions had optioned the rights to Lockwood & Co., with plans to adapt it into a television series.

The Wyoming Lottery Corporation is governed by a nine-member board of directors, with each member selected by the Wyoming Governor, Matt Mead. Jon Clontz, former Oregon State Lottery COO was selected to be the Wyoming Lottery's first CEO. History On March 13, 2013, Wyoming Governor Matt Mead authorized the creation of a state lottery, and entered into agreements with other U.S. lotteries for multi-state games. The law specifically prohibits scratchcards, instant win games, and video lottery terminals, joining the North Dakota Lottery as the only U.S. jurisdictions to prohibit scratchcards. Initially, the lottery bill had a validity period until 2019. The re-authorization clause has since been removed. In February, 2019, The Wyoming Lottery Corporation was awarded the Public Gaming Research Institute (PGRI) SHARP Award for financial excellence. Operations began on August 24, 2014, with 400 retailers authorized to sell lottery tickets.http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2013/Enroll/HB0077.pdfhttp://trib.com/news/state- and-regional/govt-and-politics/bettors-will-have-to-wait-to-buy-wyoming- lottery-tickets/article_cf8e4057-8320-5c1b-aef3-e162af42cc53.html The lottery law authorizes distribution of the first $6 million in annual revenue to cities and counties, and the remaining amount goes to schools. Given that 51 percent of national lottery revenue is derived from instant tickets, some people regard the decision to disallow scratchcards as severely restricting the potential revenue generated by the lottery. However, Matt Mead justified the law by claiming that this would reduce the amount of out-of-state spending by Wyoming residents. The Colorado Lottery estimated that $1.26 million in annual revenue was generated by Wyoming residents purchasing tickets in Colorado.Stateline — Wyoming Latest State to Catch Lottery Fever; Online Gaming Eyed Elsewhere Conversely, the Wyoming Lottery is expected to attract revenue from Utah, specifically the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, as much of Utah population centers are closer to Wyoming than either Colorado or Idaho.Wyoming may become a new ‘home of Utah lottery’  The Salt Lake Tribune Wyoming's first two lottery games were Mega Millions and Powerball, both available on the first day of sales.

Once settled in Texas, Bergman wrote letters to families in Europe, encouraging them to come to Texas. Czech immigration was driven by the availability of land in Texas and by events in Europe. In the 1840s, the Austrian Empire, which included Czech lands, was still run by a feudal system, despite the wave of democratic ideals sweeping across western Europe. This led to the Revolutions of 1848, which did little to improve the economic status of peasants who still found it difficult to gain wealth. The revolutions, together with factors such as religious persecution and mandatory military service, fueled a wave of emigration from Austria beginning in 1852. Immigrants to America were unfamiliar with the concept of American democracy due to their lack of experience with democratic ideals. The concepts of states' rights and slavery were equally foreign to the immigrants. Josef Lidumil Lesikar (1806-1887) was instrumental in organizing two groups of about 160 Czechs to immigrate to Texas in 1851 and 1853. Although about half of the first group died, Lesikar, his wife, and their four sons reached Galveston with the second group on board the Suwa in late December 1853. The family bought farmland in New Bremen, Austin County. The men felled trees and built a log house that still stands, with a Texas historical marker before it. Lesikar wrote articles for periodicals published in various parts of the United States as well as in his native land, and his writings encouraged many Czechs to come to America. As one of the founders of , a Czech newspaper published in St. Louis, he helped to lay the foundation for Czech journalism in America. In his writing he opposed secession. He died on October 21, 1887, near New Ulm and is buried in the New Ulm Cemetery. In January 1861, as tensions between northern and southern states over slavery reached a breaking point, a convention was called in Austin, TX to draft a secession document, which was then approved by a vote of the citizens in February. The recency of the Czech immigration meant that most Czechs living in Texas were not naturalized citizens, and were therefore unable to vote in the decision for secession. Texas became a member of the Confederacy in March 1861, and in April 1861, the first battle of the Civil War took place at Fort Sumter, SC. In July 1861, a Union blockade of the Southern coast reached Texas and stopped all immigration, Czech or otherwise. By the time of the blockade, the Czech population in Texas had grown from 74 in 1852 to over 700. In 1861, as the war was beginning, more than 600 men in Fayette County and 160 men in Austin County volunteered for either active duty or military reserve service. Of those enrolled, only nine in Fayette County and zero in Austin County were definitively Czech. This changed in 1862, when conscription laws for military service were established and enforced. Under the Confederate Constitution, military service was a legal method of obtaining Confederate citizenship for those who were not formerly American citizens, but aliens, unlike citizens, were not required to serve in the regular military. The exemptions for aliens were determined by the Confederate War Department to apply only to aliens who were not permanent settlers and had not renounced their native allegiance. This did not apply to the majority of Czechs because they were permanent settlers. As a result, Czechs were conscripted to serve in the Confederate Army. To avoid conscription, some chose to leave Texas and join the Union Army; others went into hiding. For many Czechs, an alternative to conscription was to carry cotton to Mexican markets as a revenue source for the Confederacy. Another alternative that arose in Fayette County was to form a stay-at-home company of troops; most were unofficial and served only to allow members to avoid official conscription. The experience of Anthony M. Dignowity provides an example of Czech resistance to the Confederacy. Dignowity was a Czech immigrant who traveled to Texas in 1835 and worked in many professions before becoming a physician in San Antonio. He opposed the Texas Revolution, viewing it as a means to increase the power of slave states in the United States, and thus did not settle in Texas until after it was admitted to the US. During the Civil War, his anti-slavery views made him a target for lynching parties, causing him to flee Texas and travel to Washington, D.C., where he stayed for the rest of the war working for the Department of the Interior. While in D.C., Dignowity proposed a plan to Congress detailing the capture and reinstatement of Texas based on the support of immigrant groups, such as the Czechs and Germans, who opposed slavery, but Congress did not act upon it. Meanwhile, Dignowity's son, Anthony Francis Dignowity, was conscripted into the Confederate Army and given the task of painting the personal carriage of General Hamilton Bee, which he completed before escaping and enlisting in the Union Army. Czech women, already familiar with the hard work of farming, managed to keep their farms and homes running during the war while their husbands were serving in the military or in hiding. In addition to the regular farm responsibilities, families also had to produce homemade commodities to substitute for increasingly expensive goods such as coffee and sugar.  Culture  SPJST Senior Living in Needville, Texas Although many Czech-Texans have experienced cultural assimilation, Czech celebrations and events continue to be held. Temple is home to the Czech Heritage Museum. A Fayetteville museum celebrates Texas's Czech settlement. In Caldwell is the Burleson County Czech Heritage Museum. In 2004, the Texas Czech Heritage and Cultural Center was opened in LaGrange. Houston's Czech Cultural Center promotes research of Czech history. Praha hosts the Praha Homecoming, also known as the Pražská Pouť, which is celebrated with Catholic mass, food, singing and dancing. The city of West hosts Westfest every Labor Day, which includes a Koláče baking contest and a Taroky tournament. Crosby, northeast of Houston, hosts a Czech Fest and a Koláče Bake. The Czech Heritage Society of Texas has developed 14 chapters throughout the state. The National Polka Festival is an annual parade and festival held in Ennis, Texas celebrating the Czech heritage in the city. The 3-day festival is held every Memorial Day weekend. Most of the party halls offer a lunch or dinner with Czech foods such as klobása (sausage), sauerkraut, and koláče, as well as live entertainment with traditional polka music and dancing. The available literature about Texas Czechs and their history has expanded with advent of self-publishing, which has made it possible for amateur historians to distribute their works. One author has declared Mr. Albert Blaha of Houston \\"the Father of Texas Czech History\\", saying that \\"He is our own František Palacký.\\"\\"From the Historiography of Czech Texas,\\" Czechoslovak and Central European Journal, published by the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Summer/Winter 1990, pp. 134-143. Naše Dějiny, \\"a magazine of Texas Czech genealogy, history and culture\\" was founded in 1983. The Library of the SPJST (Slavonic Benevolent Order of the State of Texas), founded in Temple in 1963, has holdings which \\"include over 20,000 volumes, the vast majority of which deal with Czech or Texas Czech topics.\\" In 2013, The Texas Czech Genealogical Society hosted the \\"From Generation to Generation Research Conference\\" for those interested in exploring Czech ancestry.Texas Czech Genealogical Society In 2017 HR1229 was submitted in the Texas Legislature by State Representative James White and it stated \\"That the House of Representatives of the 85th Texas Legislature here by recognize September 30, 2017, as Czech Heritage Day in Texas and honor the contributions of Czechs and people of Czech descent to this state.\\"  Texas Czech dialect  12,805 Texans can speak the Czech language. Drawing on Boas’s model for interviewing speakers of the language and digitally cataloging the dialects, John Tomecek founded and Lida Cope of East Carolina University developed the Texas Czech Legacy Project at the University of Texas at Austin to document and preserve the dwindling language. Because the majority of Texas immigrants came from Moravia, the Czech spoken in Texas is largely characterized by Moravian dialects, which vary to some extent from the Bohemian dialects spoken by most Czech-Americans. Czech- language journalism has been very active in the state over the years. Thirty- three newspapers and periodicals have been published. As of 1993 one weekly newspaper, Našinec, published at Granger, and one monthly, Hospodář, published at West, were still being published entirely in Czech. Other periodicals such as Věstník and the Brethren Journal contained sections printed in Czech.

Silver (1918–1991) was an American pediatrician who influenced the early development of the physician assistant and nurse practitioner roles in the United States. Silver co-created the nation's first pediatric nurse practitioner education program in the 1960s along with Nurse Educator Loretta Ford, and he helped establish a pediatric physician assistant program a few years later. In his later career, Silver studied and published on the abuse of medical students by physicians. Biography Henry Silver was born in Philadelphia in 1918. He attended medical school at the University of California at Berkeley. Silver served on the faculty at the University of California Medical School and Yale University School of Medicine early in his career. In 1957, Silver joined the University of Colorado School of Medicine. From 1978 to his death, Silver served as the medical school's associate dean of admissions. While at Colorado, he created a pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) program in 1964, which represented the first nurse practitioner program in the nation. The PNP program opened the next year. The successful utilization of the program's nurse practitioners led to Silver's interest in creating physician assistant (PA) training programs. A school nurse practitioner was later created at Colorado as well. Silver founded the pediatric PA program at Colorado in 1969. The initial concept behind the PA program was to train pediatric providers with five years of education after high school rather than the eleven years that it took to become a pediatrician. The program, designed to mitigate a physician shortage, initially awarded bachelor's degrees. The program's first nine graduates, who were all female and who were initially known as child care associates, began to practice in clinics and hospitals in 1972. Silver coined the term deprivation dwarfism to describe stunted child growth in spite of voracious eating. After a study of several affected children, Silver and a colleague attributed the situation to a lack of parental affection. Another growth disorder, Russell-Silver syndrome, is named in part after him. He was the co- author of a 1990 study which examined mistreatment among 431 medical students. Eighty percent of the students in the study reported incidents of mistreatment during medical school. Silver had two sons. Silver died of cancer in January 1991 at University Hospital in Denver.

After ISDI, she worked a couple of years at Decoro d'Arq,a design company, for hotel projects, including Hotel Nacional and Capri. Then she focuses on fine arts and paintings, first figurative and illustration, in the late 1990s. She does scientific illustrations (\\"Mi Libro de Lagartijas\\" Alfonso Silva Lee, published by Editorial Gente Nueva), as well as drawings for children's books, always with the same publisher. Her painting in the late 1990s and early 2000s is still in large part figurative, but already contains the main technical basis and features for her future abstract works: structure composed of multiple layers, the use of acrylic on paper or canvas, rather colorful approaches. This is the time of sales in the art markets of Habana Vieja or Vedado, where foreign tourists and young Cuban artists meet. Jeannine had her first solo exhibition in 2005 on the Isle of Youth (\\"Isla de la Juventud\\"), at the gallery of the Hermanos Saiz Association. It bears the title \\"La Puerta Perdida\\", (The Lost Gate\\") from the title of one of the paintings, and is composed only of abstract paintings, acrylic on canvas, of average size (30 x 40 \\"). Since then, with few exceptions (orders), Jeannine Achón produces only abstract works , acrylic on canvas, in medium format ( 33\\") to large (50\\"). In 2008, she has a second solo exhibition of a dozen paintings in the lobby of Hotel Sevilla Habana, one of the masterpieces of the colonial architecture of Cuba. The exhibition reflects one of the slogans of the official posters of the time: \\"No Mentir Jamás\\" (\\"Do not ever lie\\"). For the occasion, the paintings were hung through a facility with eight columns of the main hall of Sevilla. The curator of the exhibition was Toni Piñera, critic and columnist of Cuban art, long-time director of the art gallery \\"La Acacia\\" in Havana. Two years later, in late 2009, she organized an exhibition at the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists (UNEAC), entitled \\"Las Intermitencias del Color\\", a title inspired by Roland Petit's ballet \\"Proust, or Intermittences of the Heart\\" based on the eponymous work of Marcel Proust, with fifteen new large- format paintings. Toni Piñera is again curator. On the opening day, the jazz pianist Harold Lopez Nussa, friend of the painter, plays one of the songs from his album \\"Sobre el Atelier\\", composed in memory of his grandfather Leonel Lopez-Nussa, painter, writer and critic of Cuban art. During the same period, from 2007 to 2009, Jeannine participated in group exhibitions in Spain (University of Madrid) and Cuba, during the Havana Biennial. From 2010, Jeannine Achón left Havana and moved to Zagreb, Croatia, where her husband, a French diplomat, was posted. Since 2015, she is based in Toulouse (France). After two years of work, she produced a series of fifteen large paintings, grouped in a series called \\"Ashé\\". Here is what she said about it: \\"The ashé is a deeply embedded concept in Cuban culture and spirituality; it is the primordial breath, the vital energy, the world's soul. It is a power made of pure energy. I tried to get a little bit closer to this symbolic world and share it through this series of abstract paintings named by some orishas, its deities. When I paint, I try to open doors and paths to the imagination. I don’t see it as a mirror, but as a passage, toward the others and our interiority.\\"http://catalogue.drouot.com/ref-drouot/fiches-ventes-aux- encheres-drouot.jsp?id=473646&r;=ACHON+Jeannine In April 2013, her first presentation was done in Varaždin, historic city in northern Croatia, at the Galerijski Centar Varaždin.

He won three of his five starts, including the two-mile St. Leger Stakes in 1780. He was bred and owned by William Bethell. Background Ruler was a bay colt bred by William Bethell and foaled in 1777. He was sired by Young Marske, who won his only race and later became a successful stallion. Ruler was the second foal of Flora, a daughter of Lofty. Racing career Ruler's first race was at Hunmanby on 24 May 1780, when he started as the odds-on favourite for a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each. He won the race, beating Foxhuntoribus, Young Ragman, Young Hyder and one other. On 27 September, he started at the price of 5/2 for the two-mile St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster. He beat Mr. Stapleton's Antagonist (the 4/6 favourite), Lord Scarbrough's brother to Ovid, Lord Rockingham's chestnut colt, Sir John Lister Kaye's Zodiac and Colonel St. Leger's chestnut colt to win the race. His only start in 1781 was at York, where he finished third behind Fortitude and Arske. In May 1781 he beat Laura and Junior to win £50 at Hunmanby. At the York August meeting he faced Thornville, Regent and Laura in a subscription of 25 guineas each run over four miles. He looked likely to win, but dislocated his fetlock and had to be retired from racing. Stud career Ruler stood as a stallion for John Pratt until his death in 1785. Ruler then purchased by Mark Bulmer and stood at Middleham in Yorkshire. He stud fee was initially two guineas and two shilling for the groom, but after some early success it was raised to five guineas and five shillings in 1791. In 1796, 1797 and 1798 he commanded a fee of eight and a half guineas, before returning to five guineas and five shillings in 1799. Ruler died on 4 February 1806 at Wyton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, where he had moved to after 1800. He sired a good number of winners, including Governor, High Eagle, Minikin, Mittimus, Pencil, Phalanx, Sober Robin and Weathercock. One of Ruler's unnamed daughters foaled Miss Nancy, who was the dam of The Duchess. The Duchess won the St. Leger in 1816 and Ruler also sired the dam of York Royal Plate winner Sweetwilliam. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut * Ruler was inbred 3 × 4 × 4 to Godolphin Arabian.

Lucjan Mostowiak and Barbara Mostowiak  Lucjan Mostowiak (Witold Pyrkosz) and Barbara Mostowiak, born Wrzodak (Teresa Lipowska) are seniors of Mostowiak family. Lucjan is a son of Teodor Mostowiak and his wife, Maria Mostowiak. His maternal grandparents were Jan and Felicja. He was born on 19 December 1931 and died on 25 July 2017. Barbara was born on 15 May 1940. Lucjan was raised in Grabina with his older sister, Hanna. During the World War II Hanna was taken to Germany and later declared missing. In 1945 Lucjan was arrested by Germans and his parents had to pay them money to free him. He had no money, so his father stole them from Mr. Markowski who owned a shop. Markowski then committed suicide when he learnt that he lost all his money. Mostowiak family tried to find Hanna via the Red Cross but it was unsuccessful. In 2013 they learnt that Hanna moved to United States after the war and had a family. In late 1950s a teenage Barbara Wrzodak was engaged to marry Zenon Łagoda. When he decided to move to United States, she fell pregnant. Łagoda wanted Barbara to make an abortion but she refused and they split. Lucjan Mostowiak proposed to Barbara and offered her to raise her child as his own. They married on 4 November 1960 and their daughter Maria was born on 24 December 1960. They had three more children: Marta (born in 1970), Marek (born in 1978) and Małgorzata (born in 1980). They didn't tell to anyone that Maria was not Lucjan's biological child. In 1980 Lucjan and Barbara took part in a car accident - a car driven by Waldemar Jaroszy (who had not a driving license) crashed with them.

A reboot of the Dracula film series, the plot creates an origin story for the titular character, rather than using the storyline of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. In this adaptation, Dracula is the monster alter ego of historical figure Vlad III \\"the Impaler\\" Drăculea. Luke Evans portrays the title character, with Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, and Charles Dance cast in supporting roles. Principal photography began in Northern Ireland on August 5, 2013. Universal Pictures released the film in regular and IMAX cinemas on October 10, 2014. Dracula Untold grossed $217 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing its story, inconsistent tone, and characters, but praising its performances and visual effects. Plot In 15th-century Erdély (Hungarian Kingdom), Vlad Drăculea is the Prince of Wallachia and Transylvania. As a child, he was a royal ward in the palace of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and was trained to be a soldier in the Sultan's elite Janissaries corps, where he became their most feared warrior. He was called \\"Vlad the Impaler, Son of the Dragon\\", after slaughtering thousands by impaling them on spears, but became sickened by his own acts and abandoned his past. Now ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave, they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature, killing Vlad's retinue. Returning to his castle, Vlad learns from a local monk that the creature is a vampire, a Roman from the days of the Empire, who was tricked by a demon for personal success and great powers, but was trapped in the cave as price for this. Vlad celebrates an Easter feast with his wife Mirena and son Îngeraș, when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle. Vlad offers them the usual tribute payment of silver coins, but the emissary wants an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as Janissaries. Vlad refuses. Mirena believes Vlad can convince Sultan Mehmed II to show mercy. Vlad offers himself in place of the boys; but Mehmed refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition. Knowing war is coming, Vlad returns to the Broken Tooth Mountain cave to seek help from the vampire. The vampire tells him there are consequences and offers him some of his blood, which will temporarily give Vlad the powers of a vampire. If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever, and the ancient vampire will be freed, the seal on his cave broken by having given the darkness a worthy offering to plague the world like himself. Vlad accepts the offer. He discovers that he has the ability to transform into a cloud of bats. When he returns to Castle Dracula, the Ottoman army attacks, but Vlad single-handedly kills them all. He then sends most of the castle's subjects to Cozia Monastery for safety. Mirena learns of Vlad's curse, as she sees him holding silver to keep himself weak when near his people to avoid revealing his condition to them or attacking them for blood. Vlad's sudden increased strength also arouses suspicion among his subjects. That night, the Ottoman army marches on the monastery. Vlad commands an enormous swarm of bats to repel them; however, the soldiers are actually a decoy force, allowing a handful of Turks to infiltrate the monastery, kill many of the inhabitants and kidnap Îngeraș. Mirena tries to defend her son, and falls from the edge of the monastery wall. Despite his superhuman speed, Vlad cannot reach her in time. Dying, Mirena pleads with Vlad to drink her blood before the sun rises and lifts his curse, so that he will have the strength to save their son. Vlad reluctantly drinks her blood, triggering his final transformation into a full-blooded vampire and granting him even greater powers, and in doing so he frees the ancient vampire from his cave by breaking the magical seal imprisoning him. As he does so, he summons black storm clouds to block out the sun. Vlad returns to the monastery and turns the small group of survivors and mortally wounded into vampires as well. At the Ottoman army's camp, Mehmed prepares for a massive invasion of Europe. Vlad and his vampires arrive, hidden by a large lightning storm, and easily massacre the terrified Ottoman soldiers, while Vlad himself goes after Mehmed, who is holding Îngeraș captive. Aware that vampires are weakened by silver, Mehmed has lined the floor of his tent with silver coins, making Vlad's strength and speed that of a human — and impairing his vision — as Mehmed fights him with a silver sword. He overpowers Vlad and prepares to impale his heart with a wooden stake, but Vlad turns into a flock of bats and evades him. Taking the name \\"Dracula, Son of the Devil\\", he kills Mehmed with the stake and drinks his blood. Vlad then sends Îngeraș away before his vampire army preys on him, and dispels the storm clouds so that the vampires, including himself, will burn away and die in the light. However, a man who had previously observed Vlad's nature and wished to serve him drags his dying body out of the sunlight and offers him his blood, which restores Vlad to life. With Vlad presumed dead and Europe saved from the Ottoman invasion, Îngeraș is crowned the new Prince of Wallachia. In the present day, Vlad meets a woman named Mina who strikingly resembles Mirena, in the streets of a modern city (London). The vampire who cursed Vlad watches them from afar. As they walk away, he follows, saying \\"Let the games begin\\".

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Neither awful enough to suck nor sharp enough to bite, Dracula Untold misses the point of its iconic character's deathless appeal.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"Much like the recent, widely reviled I, Frankenstein, this misconceived project mainly signals a need to go back to the drawing board.\\" The Village Voices Alan Scherstuhl criticized the film, \\"And so it was, and so it was dull, the greatest villain in all cinema bitten on the neck and drained of his hottest blood.\\" Simon Adams for Roger Ebert's website gave Dracula Untold a score of 2.5/4 along with an average review, \\"If you can selectively ignore this litany of inanity, you may find some substantial earthy pleasures in Dracula Untold.\\" Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C grade and wrote, \\"It works neither as a sweeping historical epic nor as an action-horror hybrid.\\" Stephen Whitty wrote a negative review for The Star-Ledger, \\"If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself—and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes—then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?\\" The Seattle Times Moira MacDonald said, \\"It falls into that far-too-large category of studio offerings that aren't good enough to be noteworthy or terrible enough to be truly entertaining.\\" A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club said, \\"Neither the Dracula we need nor the one we deserve.\\" New York magazine's Bilge Ebiri wrote, \\"I don't want to oversell this film. But in an era in which we've seen a lot of failed attempts to reinvent classic fantasy tales as CGI-action spectacles, it feels remarkably assured.\\" Film critic Mick LaSalle gave the film two stars out of four and wrote for San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Here we have a vampire movie that brings together elements from other more popular movies.\\" Daniel Krupa from IGN said, \\"Dracula Untold recasts the famous vampire as a dark superhero. It's fast- paced, shallow fun.\\" Tim Robey of The Telegraph positively said, \\"This origin story, starring Luke Evans, really isn't as bad as it might have been.\\" He later added, \\"The intrigue can feel a little mechanical, but it doesn't overstay its welcome as badly as the clomping, similarly-designed Snow White and the Huntsman.\\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post reviewed and responded in negative, \\"The film's problems aren't limited to liberal cadging from comic books. In fact, that's precisely what's best about the film, which occasionally boasts gorgeous visuals. But the movie doesn't know when to stop stealing.\\" Jordan Hoffman of New York Daily News said, \\"The weapons, Turkish helmets and Szekler interiors are all gorgeous. If only the rest of this Lord of the Rings wanna-be were at the same level.\\" Kevin C. Johnson commented for St. Louis Post-Dispatch \\"Dracula Untold feels longer than its 95-minute running time.\\" New York Posts Kyle Smith wrote, \\"This Vlad the Impaler has all the edge of Vlasic the pickle.\\" Brian Truitt of USA Today said, \\"At times Dracula Untold flirts with dullness so much that it might as well just stick a stake in the heart of Bram Stoker's legacy.\\" Toronto Stars Peter Howell asked, \\"Whatever possessed the makers of Dracula Untold to think we'd be interested in a tragically unhip romance that backstories the infamous bloodsucker?\\" The Boston Globes Peter Keough criticized the film, \\"It's not so much untold as rewritten—if not by J. R. R. Tolkien than by some clever 12-year-old overstimulated by The Lord of the Rings.\\" Film critic Ben Kenigsberg reviewed the film for The New York Times, \\"The movie is the latest multiplex filler to co-opt a classic tale only to drown it in computer-generated murk. Even the title has the ring of something created by committee.\\" James Berardinelli reviewed for website ReelViews, \\"A generic vampire tale in the Underworld vein that comes closer to the infamous Van Helsing than a memorable re- interpretation of a legendary monster.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirers David Hiltbrand said, \\"The idea is to humanize one of the most fearful monsters in the Western crypt. But Dracula Untold goes way overboard, past domestication and into canonization.\\" Wesley Morris wrote for the website Grantland, \\"Most of the time, I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls.\\" Richard Corliss from Time magazine compared Dracula's origin story to Jesus Christ's story due to Dracula spending his childhood in a foreign land, and due to Dracula choosing to die (or become undead) in order to save his people. Corliss also complimented the film's use of its PG-13 rating by describing it as \\"robust\\". In his review, he stated, \\"Most reviewers have slammed the movie, but it's not nearly as awful, or offal, as its critical odor.\\" He later stated, \\"[Evans] carries Untold by admirably fulfilling the two essential functions of a period-movie hero: to enunciate comic-book dialogue with Shakespearean authority and to look great with his shirt off.\\" Graham Killeen of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel gave a positive review and wrote, \\"Dracula Untold tries to be The Lord of the Rings of horror movies. Surprisingly, it mostly succeeds.\\" Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant gave a fairly moderate review stating, \\"Dracula Untold is not a masterful or deep re- introduction to the franchise; but as basic genre fare, it's relatively fun in its depiction of the monster in a different light.\\" Los Angeles Times critic Gary Goldstein wrote a positive review saying, \\"As effective and fat-free as its sinewy star, Luke Evans, Dracula Untold proves an absorbing, swiftly comprehensive origin tale.\\" Future In October 2014, executive producer Alissa Phillips stated at the UK premiere of the film that a sequel to the film is in discussion. By November of the same year, Box Office Mojo speculated that based on domestic and foreign earnings to date, the film \\"is likely on the edge of earning enough to start a modest franchise.\\" In September 2016, Evans stated there have been conversations about including his character in future installments of the Dark Universe film series, referencing his contract to reprise the role. However, no further announcements have been made regarding a sequel as of 2020.

The film stars Idris Elba, Taraji P. Henson, Kate del Castillo, Mark Smith, Henry Simmons, Wilbur Fitzgerald and Frank Brennan. The film was released on September 12, 2014. Despite negative critical reception, the film was a box office success and received two Image Award nominations, winning one for Taraji P. Henson's performance.https://www.naacpimageawards.net/46th/nominees/ Plot Colin Evans has been imprisoned for over five years for manslaughter in the state of Tennessee. He is eligible for parole and during his parole hearing Colin claims he is a changed man and has been rehabilitated; but the parole board denies his release, claiming that he is not trustworthy enough. On the way back to prison, Colin outwits the corrections officers transporting him by killing them both and escapes with the van. In Atlanta, Terri Granger is a stay-at-home mother. Her best friend Meg suggests a \\"girls' night\\" to cheer Terri up after her husband Jeffrey abruptly leaves for a family visit, as she knows that Terri's relationship with Jeffrey has been suffering . Colin stalks his ex-fiancée Alexis and witnesses her meeting another man at an outdoor cafe. Colin follows her home where they argue violently, resulting in him murdering Alexis. Later that day, Colin loses control of his car and crashes into a tree during a storm. Walking down the road, he notices Terri's house. He asks her if he can use her phone to call for a tow truck. Apprehensive at first, she decides to help him, and eventually invites him inside. Meg later arrives and is shocked by Colin's presence. When Terri leaves momentarily to comfort her baby, Meg and Colin are left alone; Colin excuses himself for a cigarette break, but Meg follows him. Colin suggests that he is having an affair with Terri, but Meg does not believe him. As she begins to call out to Terri, Colin quickly grabs a shovel and bashes Meg in the head with it, killing her. As Terri returns, Colin tells her that Meg left, but Terri is suspicious, especially when she sees Meg's umbrella in the stand. Alarmed, she rushes to the kitchen to call the police, only to find out that Colin has disconnected all the wires and hidden all of her knives. Terri rushes into her daughter Ryan's bedroom to find Colin playing with her. As they exit the bedroom, Terri hits him with a fire extinguisher, making him fall down the stairs; she runs to get her children, but Colin has recovered. He tells her to put the children back in their rooms and reveals a gun. In a brief moment where she strikes him unconscious, she manages to flee to her home office and dials 911 for help. Colin recovers and discovers her in the office. She begs him to leave, explaining him that the police are coming and that his blood is all over her kitchen (because she managed to cut him earlier). Colin forces her to take the children into her vehicle and drive away with him. While walking out of the garage, Terri sees Meg's dead body on the floor. Colin makes Terri drive to Alexis' house, and introduces Terri to his dead ex- fiancée. The high winds from the storm cause Terri's car alarm to activate; worried that the noise will attract attention, Colin ties her up while he goes to check on the car. Terri answers Alexis' phone as it starts to ring and is surprised to hear Jeffrey, who is calling Alexis to find out why she has not arrived at the hotel for a rendezvous with him. Terri realizes that he was not out of town with his father and has been having an affair with Alexis. She also realizes that her encounter with Colin was not coincidencial as he wants revenge on Jeffrey because of his affair with Alexis. Terri tells her husband the truth and has him call 911. She misleads Colin into thinking that she and her children have escaped. When Colin finds her, she attacks him, grabbing his gun and shooting him until he falls out of a window. The police arrive with Jeffrey, he apologizes to Terri about the affair but she leaves him. Sometime later, a much more confident Terri returns to her career and has moved into a new house with her children.  Cast  * Idris Elba as Colin Evans * Taraji P.

This date conflicted with another Will Packer-produced film, Ride Along, a Universal Pictures release that stars Ice Cube and Kevin Hart. For this reason, in April 2013, the studio pushed back No Good Deeds release date for a second time to April 25, 2014. Yet again, in early October 2013 (and giving no specific reason), Screen Gems for a third time pushed backed the release date of the film to September 12, 2014. Sony Pictures Releasing debuted the first official trailer for the film on June 12, 2014. No Good Deed was released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 6, 2015. Box office No Good Deed was released on Friday, September 12, 2014. The film was #1 at the domestic box office over the 3-day weekend, grossing $24,250,283 at 2,175 North American theaters ($11,150 per theater average). The film was producer Will Packer's third #1 film of 2014, following Ride Along and Think Like a Man Too. No Good Deed grossed $54,323,210 worldwide. Reception No Good Deed has received generally negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 11% based on reviews from 53 critics. The site's consensus reads, \\"Dull, derivative, and generally uninspired, No Good Deed wastes its stars' talents -- and the audience's time.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 26 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics.

Soundtrack  Screen Gems and Madison Gate Records released the soundtrack to the film No Good Deed digitally and physically on September 9, 2014. The 15-track album contains the film's original score composed by Paul Haslinger. > \\"No Good Deed offered a great opportunity to re-explore a style of score I > had first developed for the film Vacancy; music designed to enhance > psychological qualities in the telling of a story, in this case, a rather > dark one. My personal preference for this kind of approach is to mix classic > film noir elements with music, sound-design elements; sometimes alternating, > sometimes superimposing them.

Biography He was born in 1712, the son of Carlo Francesco Agostino, conte di Sale e di Vinovo, the illegitimate son of Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy. In his youth, he became a soldier and started a military career in the army of the Kingdom of Sardinia, but in 1730 he decided to follow the ecclesiastic career, studying at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy.

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen won re-election to a fourth term, defeating Republican U.S. Representative Beau Boulter. Bentsen easily won the Democratic nomination for another term, while Boulter came through a run-off in the Republican primary defeating Wes Gilbreath. After winning renomination, Bentsen was chosen by Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as his vice-presidential running mate and therefore ran for both the Senate and the vice-presidency at the same time. Although the presidential ticket lost the general election and did not carry Texas, Bentsen was always the favorite for the Senate election and won with 59.2% of the vote, compared to 40% for Boulter. As of , this was the last time a Democratic candidate won a United States Senate election in Texas.  Primaries   Democratic primary  In the Democratic primary Democratic senator Lloyd Bentsen defeated the same opponent he had beaten in 1982, Joe Sullivan, a psychology professor from San Antonio. Bentsen had been Senator from Texas since first winning election in 1970 and had been re-elected in 1976 and 1982. He was also Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the clear favourite for re- election in 1988. Sullivan stood on a platform calling for reduced spending by the federal government, but had been easily defeated by Bentsen in the 1982 Democratic primary. This was repeated in 1988 with Bentsen winning the primary with over 80% of the vote.  Republican primary  Four candidates competed for the Republican nomination; U.S. representative Beau Boulter, former state representative Milton Fox, millionaire Houston businessman Wes Gilbreath and businessman Ned Snead. Boulter was a two-term representative for the 13th district, while Gilbreath was competing in his first election, but spent $500,000 on the primary. Wes Gilbreath led in the March primary with 36.7%, but as no candidate won a majority, went into a run-off election against Beau Boulter who came second with 30.5%. There were few policy differences between Boulter and Gilbreath, with both candidates being conservatives who opposed abortion and called for reduced government spending. Gilbreath spent about one million dollars of his money in his contest for the primary, while Boulter spent about $250,000. However Boulter won endorsements from many Texas Republican leaders, including the candidates who had come third and fourth in the March primary, as well as from anti-abortion groups. Boulter won the April run-off for the Republican nomination with just over 60% of the vote.  Vice- presidential candidate  In July 1988 the Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis chose Lloyd Bentsen to be the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. As the Texas Democrats had already had their primary for senate candidate, Bentsen could not be replaced on the ballot. Bentsen was however able to run both for the Senate and for vice-president as Lyndon Johnson had gotten Texas law changed in 1960 to allow Johnson to do the same at the 1960 election. However Beau Boulter attacked Bentsen for running for both the senate and vice presidency, calling it arrogant, unethical and possibly illegal. Boulter and the National Republican Senatorial Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) claiming that the dual candidacy violated federal campaign finance laws as any spending in one race would unfairly affect the other campaign, however the FEC rejected the complaint and this decision was confirmed by the United States courts of appeals. Boulter continued to attack Bentsen over the dual candidacy running a campaign advert in August 1988 mocking Bentsen for trying to ride two horses at the same time.  Campaign  Lloyd Bentsen was always the favourite for the election, with a large cash advantage over Beau Boulter. Filings with the FEC at the beginning of August showed Bentsen had $3.9 million compared to only $14,000 for Boulter. The financial advantage for Bentsen continued through the campaign and by the beginning of November Bentsen had raised $7.5 million for the senate election, while Boulter had raised $2.7 million. Boulter's campaign receive little or no official Republican support, with the Republican presidential campaign giving a not very subtle endorsement of a \\"Texas Ticket\\", which was George Bush for president and Bentsen for the senate. However Boulter hoped to benefit from Bush's coattails and ran campaign adverts pointing to his links with Bush and Ronald Reagan. Boulter also ran adverts attacking Bentsen for supporting giving benefit to illegal immigrants, but this was denied by the Bentsen campaign. Meanwhile, Bentsen ran adverts showing things they said he had done for Texas such as passing a trade bill, catastrophic coverage legislation, repealing the windfall profit tax and preserving local bus services. At the beginning of October 1988 Democratic polls were reported to show Bentsen at least 20% ahead of Boulter, with Bentsen spending much of his time campaigning for the presidential election and very little time on the senate election.  Election results  Lloyd Bentsen won the senate election by a clear margin over Beau Boulter, at the same time as he and Michael Dukakis lost the presidential race, with George Bush winning Texas with 56% of the vote compared to 43% for Dukakis. Bentsen's vote total in the senate election was reported to be at the time the highest vote total in any Texas statewide election. Boulter's showing was particularly embarrassing for the Texas GOP since Vice President Bush easily carried Texas by a margin almost identical to the one Bentsen garnered in the Senate race.

Rivoli Cinemas (also known as Rivoli Theatre and New Rivoli Theatre) is an eight-screen multiplex in the Hawthorn East suburb of Melbourne. Noted for its Art Deco architecture, the cinema was first built in 1940, and reopened as a multiplex in 2000 following a renovation and expansion. History of the cinema Located at 200 Camberwell Road, Rivoli Cinemas opened on 11 October 1940, with a showing of French Without Tears, starring Ray Milland. It had a capacity of 1,644 (Stalls 1004; Circle 640). It replaced a 1921 theatre of the same name, that had been located in Burke Road and designed by Frank Richardson. Robert McGleish, a notable figure in the Melbourne cinema scene of the time and manager of the first Rivoli, was responsible for the new cinema's construction and it was designed by architects H. Vivian Taylor and Soilleaux. In 1968,http://www.caths.org.au/cinemasvic/rivoli/rivoli.htm it was the first cinema in Australia to be converted to twin auditoriums, enabling cinema goers to choose which movie to watch. The main auditorium was split with the balcony becoming the main cinema, retaining the elaborate plasterwork, while the smaller cinema created in the stalls area did not. This action may have allowed the cinema to weather the post-war decline into the 1990s when cinema going regained popularity. An extensive $16 million restoration and expansion began in 1999, including a large addition on the west side of the building to incorporate six new screens. In 2005, the Rivoli was added to the Victorian Heritage Register.http://www.artdeco.org.au/presrivolitheatre.php  Architecture  Rivoli Cinema The Rivoli Cinemas is an excellent example of Streamline Moderne, also known as Art Moderne, the late 1930s version of Art Deco architecture. It is the only intact surviving example in Victoria of the work of cinema specialist architects H. Vivian Taylor and Soilleaux, a practice responsible for the architecture or acoustics of more than 500 cinemas and theatres in Australia. The citation notes its impressive external brickwork and internal plasterwork. The exterior façade features distinctive horizontal banded brickwork in shades of pink and oatmeal and a vertical fin. To the east is a curved-walled balcony, and the west angle incorporates a roof garden. The ground level walls around the doors originally featured cream and orange ceramic tiles, lost during succeeding alterations but reinstated in 1999–2000, along with the Art Deco-style signage on the fin. The interior of the cinema was the height of luxury when it opened, featuring a circular ticket hall on the lower level and dramatic circular staircase up to a lounge above, also an access point for the roof garden. The two-level auditorium had plaster walls and ceiling, constructed independently of the structure and considered to be an innovation. Grilles were added for decoration and to house acoustics, with lighting largely concealed behind plasterwork. Renovation work in 1999–2000, while adding substantial new areas to the building, retained original plasterwork in the largely untouched upper auditorium. The foyers, circular staircase and upper lounge are also largely original. Due to the significance of the cinema, restoration was undertaken in consultation with Heritage Victoria and the Melbourne-based Art Deco & Modernism Society (ADMS) to ensure the fabric and quality of the original architecture was maintained.  Cinema ghosts  Rivoli Cinemas was cited in an ABC science feature in 2003 on research into the existence or otherwise of ghosts. According to cinema staff, several spirits inhabited the building, including a man in Row P of Cinema One.

At least 52 people were killed and 140 injured in the attack. Turkish authorities accused the government of Syria of being behind the bombings, and within two weeks had charged 12 Turkish nationals who it said were backed by the Syrian government. The state-run Anadolu news agency reported that in February 2018, a Turkish court sentenced nine suspects to life imprisonment and 13 other people to prison terms of 10 to 15 years for the bombings; and that in September 2018 another suspect was captured in Syria and brought to Turkey by Turkish intelligence. The Syrian government denied responsibility for the attacks. Other groups proposed as culprits include al- Nusra Front, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and Syrian Resistance. Following the bombings, hundreds of Syrians fled Reyhanli, and some residents blamed the Turkish government for bringing the Syrian Civil War to the town. Background Reyhanlı is a town of 64,000 people in the far south of Turkey in Hatay Province, 5 km from the Turkey-Syria border and close to the busiest land border post with Syria, the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. Many Syrian refugees have passed through the town while fleeing from the Syrian Civil War. The nearby Cilvegözü–Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing, which is controlled on the Syrian side by rebels, is the busiest crossing point between the two countries. On 3 October 2012, mortar fire from Syria killed five people in the Turkish border town of Akçakale. On 11 February 2013, the gate of the Cilvegözü–Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing was the scene of a deadly attack, when an explosion killed 17 people and injured 30 more. Bombings Two car bombs were left outside Reyhanlı's town hall and post office. The first exploded at around 13:45 EEST (10:45 UTC), and the second about five minutes later. People attempting to help those injured in the first explosion were caught in the second blast. A Cumhuriyet journalist reported controversy over the number of fatalities. It was suspected by some news sources that government and local officials had instructed local health care workers to limit the death toll to 50, while the real number was 177. While some Syrian refugees were caught in the blasts, the majority of the fatalities involved were local Turks. Although there is still no information about the names of the dead, local officials revealed their nationalities, and stated that 5 of 52 people killed by the attacks were Syrian.Güneş, Erdem 'Syrian refugees victim of Reyhanlı bombs, too',Hurriyet Daily News, 16 May 2013. Retrieved on 18 May 2013. Responsibility Several options have been raised for the responsibility for the attack: Syrian government – Mukhabarat On Saturday, 11 May 2013, Turkey's two Deputy Prime Ministers Bülent Arınç and Besir Atalay said \\"the Syrian Mukhabarat and armed organizations are the usual suspects in planning and the carrying out of such devilish plans\\", and Turkish sources accused Syria of being \\"behind the attacks\\". Syria, according to information minister Omran al-Zoubi, immediately denied responsibility for the attacks, stating: \\"Syria [...] would never commit such an act because our values would not allow that.\\" On 11 May, Turkish authorities said they had detained nine Turks with links to the Syrian Mukhabarat (military intelligence service) as suspects in the bombings. On 13 May , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that he held the Syrian government responsible. By 21 May, Turkey had charged 12 Turkish nationals with the attacks, which they alleged were backed by the Syrian government. On 25 May, Erdogan repeated his accusation that the Syrian regime was behind the attack. Nasir Eskiocak, a Turkish national captured by the Turkish police on 10 June 2013 and for a while the prime suspect of the attack, said the attack was ordered by the Syrian Mukhabarat, and then organized by him. On 12 September 2018, the Turkish National Intelligence Organization announced that they had captured Yusuf Nazik, who they alleged is one of the main suspects of the 2013 bombing. He was captured by Turkish intelligence in the Syrian regime-controlled city of Latakia. Nazik, born in the Antakya district of the province of Hatay, confessed in a video-recorded confession that he played a key part in the bombing as a coordinator between the bombers and the Syrian regime, which he said masterminded the attack. He referred to a Syrian intelligence officer named Mohammed, who had the codename \\"Hadji\\". Al-Nusra Front / al-Qaeda / ISIL * Al-Nusra: Mehmet Ali Ediboglu (CHP), representing Hatay Province in the Turkish parliament, said on 14 May 2013 he believed the al-Nusra Front (Jabhat al-Nusra) to have planted the bombs, in an attempt \\"to get Turkey into the war\\". * al-Qaeda elements: On 25 May 2013, the Turkish hacker group RedHack alleged that leaked or hacked documents of Turkey's Gendarmerie intelligence department linked al-Qaeda- related groups in Syria to the attack, which was denied by Justice and Development Party (AKP) vice president Hüseyin Çelik. Çelik stated that the documents were leaked by a private using a cell phone but its content is unrelated to the bombings and the private is under arrest. On 27 March 2014, also Tacan İldem, Turkey's Ambassador to the OCSE, said the 11 May 2013 attack was carried out by \\"al-Qaeda elements operating out of Syria\\", which, in May 2013, may have meant either Jabhat al-Nusra or ISIL. That statement was contradicted on 6 April 2014 in a written statement of the Turkish Foreign Ministry who stuck to their conviction that the attack was carried out with support from the Syrian government. * ISIL: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in late September 2013, while threatening Turkey with suicide attacks if Turkey would not reopen its Syrian border crossings at Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salameh before 7 October, claimed responsibility for the Reyhanli attack of 11 May 2013. Acilciler versus Turkish government Turkish authorities on 12 May 2013 suspected that former Turkish Marxist group Acilciler, now thought to be based in Syria, might have been revived by his leader Mihrac Ural, and might have ordered the attack. Acilciler was, according to The Huffington Post, long-rumored to have been formed by the Syrian military intelligence service Mukhabarat. The Turkish government on 12 May 2013 believed that Ural and his group, with their ties to pro-government Syrian groups, had carried out the attack. Mihraç Ural, in return, has implicated the Turkish Intelligence Organization. Gülen movement In 2015, former Adana prosecutor Özcan Şişman said in a letter to the Cumhuriyet newspaper that he was warned by MIT officers about a planned bombing attack in 2012 and 2013, three days before the Reyhanli attack. And that he was urged by the officers to carry out an operation against the cell. Şişman said he refused to carry out the operation and did not inform the police. Şişman was arrested in the same year and was sentenced 17 years in prison in 2019 for obtaining and exposing state secrets and being a member of the Gülen movement. Aftermath There was widespread panic in Reyhanlı following the blasts, with many people attempting to flee the town. Clashes broke out between Turkish and Syrian people in Reyhanlı, and police were forced to intervene by firing into the air to disperse the crowds. Turkish residents of the town reportedly attacked Syrian refugees and automobiles with Syrian license plates. BBC Journalist Wyre Davies reported from the site of the bombings in Reyhanli that there was 'real anger' among the people on the streets, not just against whoever had carried out the attacks but also against the government in Ankara. Hundreds of Syrian refugees had been forced to leave, 'scapegoats for the crimes of others' in Davies' account, blamed for bringing the Syrian war to the town. The refugees were held to have made the town a target for Assad's agents in Turkey. The media also were unpopular. \\"Whoever carried out the bombings has deliberately and successfully driven a wedge between two communities who had always coexisted, even before the war, because of cross- border trade and other historic ties\\", the journalist wrote. In response to the attacks, the Turkish government sent large numbers of air and ground forces increasing the already heavy military presence in the area. Protesters clashed with police in the town on Saturday, 18 May, voicing their anger over the government's response to the attack and its decision to take in Syrian refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict. Turkey sealed the border with Syria for one month in order to stop possible suspects from escaping. Media ban The Reyhanlı Court of Peace ordered all voice, written, and visual publications referring to the blasts' aftermath banned, including content describing, and images of, the injured and the dead. The court ruled that the written and visual content would jeopardize the confidentiality and outcome of the ongoing prosecution. On 16 May 2013, the Hatay First Criminal Court cancelled the order issued by the Reyhanlı Court of Peace. Only the state-run Anatolia news agency and Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) were allowed to cover visits by Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin and Health Minister Mehmet Müezzinoğlu to the injured in Antakya State Hospital. When the main opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, of the Republican People's Party (CHP), visited the victims at the same hospital on Monday, only reporters from Anatolia and TRT were allowed to cover Kılıçdaroğlu's visit, while reporters from the Cihan News Agency, the İhlas News Agency and the Doğan News Agency were not allowed to do so. Several media unions protested the media ban imposed on the Reyhanlı bombings and appealed to the courts to remove the ban immediately. The media ban was condemned by several journalistic organizations in Turkey. Atilla Sertel, the chairperson of the Journalists Federation of Turkey, stated that such bans would cause major misinformation and would result in misleading the public. The Press Institute Association of Turkey claimed the court order upholding the ban was a censure and a major blow to press freedom. Reactions Domestic Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said, \\"There may be those who want to sabotage Turkey's peace, but we will not allow that. No one should attempt to test Turkey's power. Our security forces will take all necessary measures.\\" Speaking in Berlin, he said that the bombings were a consequence of global inaction in intervening in the Syrian civil war. Opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu held Erdogan accountable for the bombings and compared him to Syria's president Assad. Erdogan threatened to sue him in response. International Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi placed responsibility for the attacks on the Turkish authorities and said, \\"it was the Turkish government that had facilitated the flow of arms, explosives, vehicles, fighters and money across the border into Syria\\", and thus \\"had turned the border areas into centres for international terrorism\\". The UN Security Council strongly condemned the Reyhanli bombings, stating, \\"Any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.\\" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen also condemned the attack, calling it \\"despicable\\", and said that NATO stood by Turkey. British Foreign Secretary William Hague issued a Twitter statement saying, \\"My thoughts are with family and friends of the victims. We stand with the people of Turkey.\\" United States Ambassador Francis Ricciardone stated that the U.S. \\"strongly condemns today's vicious attack, and stands with the people and government of Turkey to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\\" Investigations On 11 May, the authorities had immediately detained nine suspected Turks. By 20 May, 18 people had been detained. Investigations have revealed that Ankara was the initial target of the recent attacks in Reyhanlı, according to Deputy Prime Minister Beşir Atalay. In July 2013, several MİT intelligence officials were dismissed for negligence, after an inquiry concluded that MİT had had sufficient information to prevent the attack, but had failed to share it with police quickly enough.Today's Zaman, 14 Jul 2013, MİT provincial chief sacked over unshared intelligence in Reyhanlı attack See also *List of Islamist terrorist attacks *2019 Reyhanlı car bombing *Syria–Turkey relations *Syrian–Turkish border incidents during the Syrian civil war *Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War References Category:2013 murders in Asia Category:2010s murders in Turkey Category:Explosions in 2013 Category:Building bombings in Turkey Category:Car and truck bombings in Turkey Category:Censorship in Turkey Category:History of Hatay Province Category:Mass murder in 2013 Category:Mass murder in Turkey Category:May 2013 crimes Category:May 2013 events in Asia Category:Syria–Turkey relations Category:Terrorist incidents in Turkey in 2013 ","title":"2013 Reyhanlı car bombings"},{"id":"39359422","text":"Lucy Watson is a British journalist and newsreader.

Furthermore, The Solar Garden develops small-scale techniques to preserve the environment, such as a garbage-sorting and a recycling project based on a wide range of reusable materials, the production of compost and aquaponic systems. The project was initiated by Yaniv Fieldust in January 2011, because of his concern about the state of the environment in Israel and the lack of awareness amongst the Israeli people of this.

The battle began on 10 May 1940 and lasted just one day. Facing only light resistance, German troops quickly occupied Luxembourg. The Luxembourgish government, and Grand Duchess Charlotte, managed to escape the country and a government-in-exile was created in London. Background On 1 September 1939 Germany invaded Poland, initiating World War II. This put Luxembourg's Grand Ducal government in a delicate situation. On the one hand, the population's sympathies laid with the UK and France; on the other hand, due to the country's policy of neutrality since the Treaty of London in 1867, the government adopted a careful non-belligerent stance towards its neighbours. In accordance with the treaty's restrictions, the only military force Luxembourg maintained was its small Volunteer Corps under Captain Aloyse Jacoby, reinforced by the Grand Ducal Gendarmerie under Captain Maurice Stein. Together they formed the Corps des Gendarmes et Volontaires under Major-Commandant Émile Speller. At noon on 1 September Radio Luxembourg announced that in order for the country to remain unambiguously neutral it would cease broadcasting. Exceptions were a daily 20 minute-long message at midday and in the evening reserved for government announcements. For the rest of the month, the government supplied full transcripts of its broadcasts to the foreign legations in the country. Later that day several German stations posed as Radio Luxembourg by broadcasting in the Luxembourgian wavelength, making, in the opinion of United States Chargé d'Affaires George Platt Waller, \\"grossly unneutral announcements\\". On the evening of 21 September, the Grand Ducal government suspended all broadcasts pending the resolution of the war. On 14 September the volunteer corps was bolstered by the addition of a 125-strong auxiliary unit. German military maneuvers and river traffic made the population increasingly nervous, so in the spring of 1940 fortifications were erected along the borders with Germany and France. The so-called Schuster Line, named after its chief constructor, consisted of 41 sets of concrete blocks and iron gates; 18 bridgeblocks on the German border, 18 roadblocks on the German border, and five roadblocks on the French border. Since the Corps des Gendarmes et Volontaires had no pioneer unit, construction fell to the responsibility of civilian engineers, while technical advice was sought from the French, who took great interest in the line's establishment. A series of nine radio outposts were established along the German border, each manned by gendarmes, with a central radio receiver in Captain Stein's official office near the volunteers' Saint-Esprit Barracks in the capital. On 4 January 1940, the Cabinet convened under Grand Duchess Charlotte and outlined steps to be taken in the event of a German invasion. Charlotte decided that if possible she and the government would flee abroad in the event of an attack to advocate for the country's sovereignty. During World War I, her elder sister and then- Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde had elected to stay during Germany's occupation of the country, bringing the monarchy into disrepute; Charlotte wanted to avoid such problems. The government moved some of the country's gold reserves to Belgium, and began stockpiling funds in its Brussels and Paris legations in the event it was forced to flee due to German attack. The Paris legation was also given a sealed envelope detailing a formal request of military assistance from the French government in case communications from the mainland were cut- off in an invasion. After several false alarms in the spring of 1940, the probability of a military conflict between Germany and France grew. Germany stopped the export of coke for the Luxembourgish steel industry. Abwehr agents under Oskar Reile infiltrated the country, posing as tourists.Horne, Alistair, To Lose a Battle, p.258-264 This was observed by Captain Fernand Archen, an undercover senior French intelligence officer in Luxembourg City, posing as a wine merchant. He reported his findings to his superiors at Longwy on 7 May, understanding that the agents were to be used to seize key bridges over the Sauer, Moselle and Our rivers. Luxembourg authorities also took notice, and Captain Stein worked to stop the Germans' activities. On 3 March, the French Third Army was ordered to occupy Luxembourg in the event of a German attack. Prelude On the evening of 8 May, the Grand Ducal Government ordered for the first time that all doors of the Schuster Line be closed at 11:00 and remain so regardless of circumstance until 06:00 the following morning. Throughout the day Luxembourgian authorities witnessed much less activity on the far side of the border and made no reports of tank or machine gun movements. On the afternoon of 9 May, a French intelligence officer stationed in Clervaux witnessed German troops preparing pontoon bridges in the Sauer. He attempted in vain to contact Captain Archen, and resorted to making a direct phone call to his superiors at Longwy. Also that day a German national gardener and member of the German fifth column warned his Luxembourgish employer, Carlo Tuck, that an invasion was impending. Tuck passed the warning on to government officials. Late that evening, the Grand Ducal government came into possession of a document from a German divisional command. Dated 23 April 1940, it detailed the division's chief of staff's orders to various units to occupy strategic points within the country. The Grand Ducal government put all border posts and Grand Ducal Gendarmerie stations on full alert. In Luxembourg City, gendarmes mobilised to defend public buildings and dispatched vehicle patrols to arrest fifth columnists. The economic councillor and the chancellor of the German legation were detained for questioning regarding allegations that they had used legation cars to organise subversive activities within the country. Since an invasion had not yet occurred they still enjoyed diplomatic privilege and the police were forced to release them. One group of fifth columnists was arrested while attempting to reach the legation. Meanwhile, Captain Archen had received his subordinate's report, but by that point, he had been told by informants in the Gendarmerie that shots had been exchanged with German operatives at a remote farm near the Moselle. At 11:45 on 9 May he radioed Longwy: \\"Reports of important German troop movements on the German- Luxembourg frontier.\\" Throughout the night his messages became more and more frantic. Two Luxembourgish customs officials at Wormeldange heard horses and soldiers across the Moselle, but were unable to make out the Germans' activities due to heavy fog. At around midnight, Captain Stein, Minister of Justice Victor Bodson, and Police Commissioner Joseph Michel Weis held an emergency meeting. Bodson requested that the capital be reinforced by gendarmes from the south, and told Weis to forward this information to the capital's district commissioner to give the necessary orders. Weis later tried to contact the district commissioner by phone, but failed to reach him; reinforcements never came. A short time later the gendarmes at Diekirch were ordered to patrol the local railway bridge and be wary of unfamiliar persons. Luxembourgian authorities received the first reports of exchanged fire at around 02:00 on 10 May when two gendarmes were ambushed near the German border by plainclothes agents. The Germans retreated to the Fels mill near Grevenmacher and around 20 soldiers who volunteered were dispatched to arrest them. The government then ordered all steel doors along the border locked. At 02:15 soldiers stationed in Bous were attacked by Germans in civilian clothes. One soldier was badly injured, as was one German who was detained. Shortly thereafter a gendarmerie lieutenant and his chauffeur were ambushed and exchanged fire with German-speaking cyclists; no one was hurt. Fifth columnists successfully severed the telephone wires between the capital and the border posts, forcing the gendarmes to communicate via shortwave radio. German agents gradually seized the radio stations; the last post to fall, in Wasserbillig, transmitted until the Germans breached the operating room. The steel doors of the Schuster Line were ordered closed on 10 May 1940 at 03:15, following reports of movement of German troops on the east side of the border rivers Our, Sauer, and Moselle. At 03:30 Luxembourgian authorities released interned French pilots and German deserters. The Royal Family was evacuated from its residence in Colmar-Berg to the Grand Ducal palace in Luxembourg City. Around 30 minutes later, at dawn, German planes were spotted flying over Luxembourg City towards Belgium. Invasion Map showing the German invasion routes The German invasion began at 04:35 when the 1st, 2nd, and 10th Panzer Divisions crossed the border at Wallendorf-Pont, Vianden, and Echternach respectively. Wooden ramps were used to cross over the Schuster Line's tank traps. Fire was exchanged, but the Germans did not encounter any significant resistance save for some bridges destroyed and some land mines since the majority of the Luxembourgish Volunteer Corps stayed in their barracks. The border was defended only by soldiers who had volunteered for guard duty and gendarmes. A handful of Germans secured the bridge at Wormeldange and captured the two customs officers there, who had demanded that they halt but refrained from opening fire. The partly demolished bridge over the Sauer at Echternach was quickly repaired by engineers of the Großdeutschland regiment, allowing the passage of the 10th Panzer Division. Planes flew overhead, heading for Belgium and France, though some stopped and landed troops within the country. Captain Archen repeatedly alerted his superiors at Longwy of the invasion, but his reports never reached the 3rd Army at Metz. General Charles Condé, the army's commander, was unclear about the situation and at 05:30 dispatched aerial reconnaissance units to investigate. At 06:00 the French 3rd Light Cavalry Division was ordered to intervene. Telephone and radio messages from the border posts to the Gendarmerie and Volunteer Corps headquarters informed the Luxembourgish government and Grand Ducal court of the invasion. Foreign Minister Joseph Bech, in the presence of Prime Minister Pierre Dupong, attempted to contact the German ambassador at the legation and at his private residence, but they were informed that he was present at neither. At 06:30 the majority of the government, including Dupong and Bech, evacuated the capital by motorcade to the border town of Esch. Bodson stayed behind at the Saint- Esprit Barracks to monitor the situation. In Esch a group of 125 German special operations troops had landed by Fieseler Storch, with orders to hold the area until the main invasion force arrived. A gendarme confronted the soldiers and asked that they leave, but he was taken prisoner. The government motorcade encountered a roadblock at a crossroads manned by German units, and was forced to detour through the countryside to avoid capture. French Ambassador Jean Tripier followed the government party but was stopped by the Germans and forced to return to the capital. Belgian Ambassador Kervyn de Meerendré was also stopped by German soldiers at the border and ordered to turn back, as was the Luxembourgish Minister of Education, Nicolas Margue, who had attempted to escape by taxi. Bodson later fled the capital and, having learned many of the secondary roads by memory, was able to avoid German roadblocks and navigate his way to France. Following consultation with her ministers, Grand Duchess Charlotte decided to abandon the palace. Accompanied by her husband, Prince Felix, her mother, Dowager Grand Duchess Marie Anne, and members of the Grand-Ducal suite, she departed for the border village of Redange. After a brief stop, her party crossed the border at 07:45. Meanwhile, Hereditary Grand Duke Jean and two of his sisters, accompanied by an aide-de- camp, Guillaume Konsbruck, were to wait at the border for confirmation of occupation. Around 08:00 the prime minister and his entourage passed over the border before making contact with French troops at Longlaville. Last minute telephone calls with Luxembourg City revealed the capital to be completely surrounded. Charlotte's party was able to link up with the government motorcade at Longwy. Meanwhile, Jean's party's car was strafed by a German aircraft while stopped at a cafe. Near Esch, the group was delayed by a German roadblock, and they escaped when their chauffeur drove straight through the soldiers. The party ultimately joined Charlotte and the Grand Ducal government at Sainte-Menehould. At 08:00, elements of the French 3rd Light Cavalry Division under General Petiet, supported by the 1st Spahi Brigade under Colonel Jouffault and the 2nd company of the 5th Armoured Battalion, crossed the southern border to conduct a probe of German forces; these units later retreated behind the Maginot Line. Five Spahis were killed. British Air Marshal Arthur Barratt, impatient with the reluctance of the French Air Force to conduct air strikes, ordered a flight of Fairey Battle bombers from the 226 Squadron to attack German tank columns. They went unescorted and encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire. Most were damaged by flak but managed to escape. One received a direct hit and crashed near Bettendorf. German soldiers pulled the three injured crew from the burning wreckage, one of whom later died in a local hospital. The Grand Ducal Gendarmerie resisted the German troops, but to little avail; the capital city was occupied before noon. The Gendarmerie chain of command in the south was thrown into disarray by the influx of refugees and the arrival of German and French troops. Most gendarmes escorted refugees over the border, while some abandoned their posts and fled to France. Total Luxembourgish casualties amounted to six gendarmes and one soldier wounded, while 22 soldiers (six officers and 16 non-commissioned officers) and 54 gendarmes were captured. By the evening of 10 May 1940, most of the country, with the exception of the south, was occupied by German forces. More than 90,000 civilians fled from the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette as a consequence of the advance. 47,000 evacuated to France, 45,000 poured into the central and northern part of Luxembourg. Aftermath On 11 May the Grand Ducal government reached Paris and installed itself in the Luxembourg legation. Fearing German aerial attack and finding the small facilities unsuitable, the government moved further south, first to Fontainebleau, and then Poitiers. It later moved to Portugal and the United Kingdom, before finally settling in Canada for the duration of the war. Charlotte, exiled in London, became an important symbol of national unity. Her eldest son and heir, Jean, volunteered for the British Army in 1942. The only official representative left behind was , head of the Ministry of State Affairs, as well as the 41 deputies. By the end of May Wehrer and several high ranking functionaries established a provisional \\"Administrative Commission\\" to govern Luxembourg in lieu of the Grand Ducal family and the other ministers. Wehrer retained the Ministry of State Affairs and assumed responsibility for Foreign Relations and Justice; Jean Metzdorf held the portfolios for Interior, Transportation, and Public Works; Joseph Carmes managed Finance, Labour, and Public Health; Louis Simmer oversaw Education, and Mathias Pütz directed Agriculture, Viticulture, Commerce, and Industry. In the days after the invasion Luxembourgian officers walked about the capital freely, though the regular soldiers were mostly confined to their barracks. Colonel Speller was briefly incarcerated by the Gestapo, though he was later released under close supervision.

Development and production Mixology, which is the first television project for film writers Lucas and Moore, was the subject of a bidding war among the networks in October 2012, resulting in ABC eventually picking up the project with a put pilot commitment. In February 2013, Seacrest's production company became a joint partner on the project and Wass was added to the production staff. Casting Of the 10 cast members who were added during the project, one of the members who was first added when it was announced, Mercedes Masöhn, decided to exit the production in March 2013 to seek other projects. She was replaced by Ginger Gonzaga a week later. Also, in main publicity shots of the entire cast, Sarah Bolger is seen as an original cast member, but after exiting the production was replaced by Frankie Shaw. Episodes Reception Ratings The pilot episode \\"Tom & Maya\\" debuted on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on , to an audience of 4.98 million viewers, it would become the most watched episode of the series. The second episode \\"Liv and Ron\\", one week later, drew 4.64 million viewers. The least watched episode of the series is the seventh episode \\"Bruce & Fab\\", which drew 3.65 million viewers. The finale episode of the series \\"Closing Time\\" which aired on , to an audience of 4.04 million viewers. Critical reception Brian Lowry of Variety gave a score of 80%, and wrote, \\"Maintaining this sort of rat-a-rat patter is no small feat, but the series gets off to such a promising start as to bode well for future installments. Moreover, the shifting pairings from episode to episode create a semi- serialized element that deftly builds off the groundwork laid the previous week, conjuring questions about who’s going to wind up with whom.\\" Karen Valby of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a \\"B\\" grade, and wrote, \\"If you like-- or like zoning out to--slick and shiny romantic comedies in the vein of New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day, Mixology is the show for you.

The film stars Tom Hardy in the title role, the only character seen on screen, as he carries on a number of speakerphone conversations with characters voiced by Olivia Colman, Ruth Wilson, Andrew Scott, Ben Daniels, Tom Holland and Bill Milner. The film premiered at Broad Street in Westside, Birmingham, US, at the 70th Venice Film Festival on 2 September 2013. The film had a limited release in the United Kingdom beginning on 18 April 2014, and grossed $5 million worldwide. Locke received critical acclaim, particularly for Hardy's performance, which won him the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor. Plot The evening before he must supervise a large concrete pour in Birmingham (the largest non-nuclear facility, non-military concrete pour in European history), construction foreman Ivan Locke learns that Bethan, a colleague from a job in Croydon with whom he had a one-night stand seven months before (which resulted in her becoming pregnant), has gone into premature labour. Despite his job responsibilities and although his wife and sons are eagerly awaiting his arrival home to watch an important football match, Locke decides to drive to London to be with Bethan during childbirth. Locke never forgave his father for abandoning him as a child, and he is determined not to make the same mistake, even though he has no relationship with, nor any particular feelings for, Bethan. Over the course of the one and a half-hour drive from Birmingham to London, Locke holds a total of 36 phone calls with: his boss Gareth; his backup colleague Donal; Katrina, wife of 15 years, to confess his infidelity; his sons, Eddie and Sean, who call him separately with updates on the match and (eventually) the worrisome breakdown of their mother; St Mary's maternity unit medical personnel, Sister Margaret then Halil Gullu, who are working with Bethan through some troubling complications; the council head, Cassidy, and local police authority, PC Davids, required for the road closures needed to allow the 225+ concrete trucks to properly access the site; and with Bethan to reassure her during her labour. During these calls, he is fired from his job, banned from his house by his wife, and asked by his older son to please return home. He coaches his assistant Donal through preparing the pour despite some major setbacks, and has imaginary conversations with his dead father, whom he envisions (unseen onscreen) as a passenger in the car; he berates his father for abandoning Locke's family, and vows he will not repeat that mistake. When he is close to the hospital, Bethan calls to share the cooing of the baby, having had a successful birth. Cast Starring * Tom Hardy as Ivan Locke Voices * Olivia Colman as Bethan Maguire * Ruth Wilson as Katrina Locke * Andrew Scott as Donal * Ben Daniels as Gareth * Tom Holland as Eddie Locke * Bill Milner as Sean Locke * Danny Webb as Cassidy * Alice Lowe as Sister Margaret * Silas Carson as Halil Gullu * Lee Ross as PC Davids * Kirsty Dillon as Gareth's wife Production Almost the entire film takes place within a BMW X5, which was pulled down the M6 motorway on a low flatbed trailer for most of the shoot. Shooting took place over eight nights, with the crew only taking breaks to change the three cameras' memory cards. Ivan Locke is the only character to appear onscreen; the others are heard on the vehicle's speakerphone, with their parts also recorded in real time (Locke's vehicle and road noise included) as they called from a conference room that served as the multiple \\"locations\\" of the various characters. Release Locke was shown out of competition at the 70th Venice International Film Festival as well as the Spotlight program in the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was released on 18 April 2014 in the United Kingdom, where it earned $3,264,654. On 25 April 2014 it opened in the United States and earned $1,375,769. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on 12 August 2014. Reception Hardy (pictured at the film's premiere) received critical acclaim for his lead performance. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of 212 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.71/10. The critical consensus states: \\"A one-man show set in a confined location, Locke demands a powerful performance – and gets it from a never- more-compelling Tom Hardy.\\" The film has a score of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 37 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Olly Richards of Empire awarded the film 4/5 stars and said: \\"There are films to see on huge screens, but this is one that almost cries out for a small cinema, surrounded by total blackness. It's a daring experiment brilliantly executed, with Tom Hardy giving one of the best performances of his career\\". In his book How to Watch a Movie (2015), David Thomson singles out this film and says: \\"No film I've seen in recent years is more eloquent on where we are now, and on how alone we feel. There is little left but to watch and listen.\\" For his performance, Hardy won the Best Actor Award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.

The mascot — a cartoon of an elephant holding a signal lamp with a green light in one hand- was initially designed for Indian Railways' 150th year commemoration events and was unveiled on 16 April 2002 in Bangalore. Later in 2003, Indian Railways decided to permanently retain it as the official mascot. The icon was placed on the reverse of a coin.  Development  Railways were introduced in India on 16 April 1853, with a line from Bombay to Thane. To commemorate the 150th year of the event, Indian Railways planned a series of events in 2002–03 which included launching a mascot. Bholu was designed by the National Institute of Design in consultation with the Railway ministry and was unveiled on 16 April 2002 in Bangalore. On that day, Bholu flagged off the Karnataka Express at 6.25 pm from platform number 1 of the Bangalore city station. According to the Indian Government (Railway Board)'s Manual for Public Relations Department (2007), Bholu was designated for official use effective 15 April 2002. Later, on 24 March 2003, they decided to retain Bholu as the official mascot of Indian Railways.  Qualification, Designation & Work  The educational qualification of the Train Guard/TG is Graduation (10+2+3) in any discipline. It is the one & only post in Indian Railways which was reserved for the Britishers in the British era, at that time one & only the graduate Britishers were recruited for this post. He is the In-Charge of Train (Coaches or Wagons with Loco) and this post is a Supervisory (Non-Gazetted Officer) post in Traffic (Operating) department of Indian Railways. They have only two designations, the first one is Train Guard/TG and the last one is Senior Train Guard/Sr TG, but their authorizations are different, the first one is for Freight (Goods & Parcel) trains, the last one is for Coaching (Passenger & Mail Express) trains. At first he checks the Mechanical V certificate/M V (Brake Power Certificate/BPC) of the Senior Section Engineer/SSE of Coaching & Depot/C & D department or Carriage & Wagon/C & W department of his working station, if there is any dispute in this paper, he should give a memo to the Deputy Traffic Controller/Dy TC of his working division through the Deputy Station Master/Dy SM of his working station, after this he takes the Caution Order (Sectional Speed Restriction order) of the Divisional Engineer/DE of Civil Engineering department of his working division through the Deputy Station Master/Dy SM of his working station, after these he takes over the charge of the train and he goes to the Train Guard cab of his train, then he checks the Air Pressure Continuity/APC from the Train Guard Cab to the Loco with the Loco Driver/LD by dropping the air pressure, if everything is ok, he should give the Deputy Traffic Controller/Dy TC ready through the Deputy Station Master/Dy SM, then the Deputy Traffic Controller/Dy TC gives the Deputy Station Master/Dy SM permission to change the aspect of signal from on (red) to off (green), then the Deputy Station Master/Dy SM changes the aspect of signal from on to off, at this time Loco Driver/LD observes the off signal, then the Loco Driver/LD takes the permission from him to start the train through the Assistant Loco Driver/ALD, then he gives the Loco Driver/LD permission to start the train through Assistant Loco Driver/ALD and the Loco Driver/LD always follows his command through Assistant Loco Driver/ALD, he holds a multicolour flashlight with green light in one hand to exchange All Right Signal/ARS with the Deputy Station Master/Dy SM and Assistant Loco Driver/ALD. The Train Guard/TG is the initial person in Indian Railways who has the authority to control the movement of a train, then the Traffic Controllers/TCs, the Operating Managers/OMs. The green light is the symbol of movement, which assures trains and passengers to go ahead with safety and without fear.  Popularity  The mascot became very popular in India. When asked why they chose an elephant as their mascot and of their opinion on Bholu, Indian Railway officials said that Bholu is friendly and helpful. An Indian Government official release in 2003 described Bholu as an \\"ethical, responsible, sincere and cheerful icon\\". The same report stated that other than denoting stability, it represents the Indian Railways workforce as well. Also in 2003 the Indian Government released a two-() rupee coin which carried the impression of Bholu on its reverse side.

It was built in 1921, as a 13-story, 15-bay-by-15 bay, U-shaped steel-frame building in the Classical Revival style. The building has a watertable of gray granite, a limestone-clad two-story plus mezzanine base, and a shaft of buff-colored brick. Atop the building is a limestone cornice. The Market Street elevation features three monumental- scaled arched entrance openings reminiscent of ancient Roman buildings. and It once had a 22-story modern office building at its center that has since been removed. The building has been converted to residential use. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. History The Delaware Trust Building was built in phases beginning with the first section at 9th and Market Streets in 1919–21. It was commissioned by William du Pont and Alfred I. du Pont to house the Delaware Trust Company and other businesses associated with the du Ponts. The original 13-story building was designed by Dennison & Hirons and cost $1.2 million. In 1930, it was expanded into a U-shaped building with two additional wings extending north along Market and King Streets. Phillip T. Harris of Philadelphia was the architect for this project, which cost a further $1.2 million. A five-story addition was built in 1938 in the center courtyard of the building, which previously had been used for parking. In 1958–60, a modernist 22-story office tower was added to the center of the building, replacing the 1938 section. This was known as the Hercules Tower after its main tenant, the Hercules Powder Company, and had its own separate entrance at 910 Market Street in addition to being connected to the existing building. The tower was designed by local architect W. Ellis Preston. At , it was the tallest building in Delaware until being surpassed by 1201 North Market Street in 1988. In 1997, the building was damaged by a fire that burned much of the 11th–15th floors and was ultimately determined to have been caused by arson. The fire caused the building to become contaminated with asbestos fibers and it was left mostly vacant during a protracted battle between the owners and insurer over the cost of cleanup. In 2002, the building was sold and converted to residential use with the name The Residences at Rodney Square. In order to allow more light into the apartments, the Hercules Tower was demolished and the walls facing the courtyard were reconstructed. In 2003, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Delaware Trust Building depicted on a postcard, c. 1930–45 Architecture In its current configuration, the Delaware Trust Building is a 13-story, U-shaped building with the three sides of the U extending along Market, 9th, and King Streets. The building's two-story base is clad in limestone, with a granite water table, and the upper floors are faced with buff-colored brick and limestone trim. The Market Street elevation has three large arched entrances and is ornamented with Classical Revival elements including pilasters, rusticated stonework, festoons, and other carved details. A dentiled cornice extends around the building above the second floor and there are string courses above the third and eleventh floors. Arched windows on the 13th floor mark the top of the building.

It borders on Bangladesh, and the Indian states of West Bengal and Meghalaya. The Brahmaputra divides the district into two parts. Tributaries of the Brahmaputra such as Gangadhar, Gaurang, Tipkai, Champamoti in the north and Jinjiram, Jinari and Kaloo in the south are all major contributors of floods in the area.

Flood waters had washed away the tracks in 1988. The long line was ready after gauge conversion in 2010. Up to the sixties there was a -wide metre-gauge railway link from Cooch Behar to Dhubri via Golokganj. It was then known as the Assam Line Railway Service. It also connected East Pakistan, even after partition. However, collapse of the rail- cum-road bridge over the Gadadhar in the seventies ended that link.

The group was called Chiltern Harmony, and under Ian Stone's direction, became members of LABBS (The Ladies' Association of British Barbershop Singers) later that year. Over the next few years the chorus grew in number and won a number of accolades as chorus directorship was passed from Ian Stone to Wendy Searle to Gay McBride, and is currently directed by Helen Lappert. In 2007, to match the young, dynamic vibe of the chorus, the group changed its name to Amersham A Cappella, the name by which the chorus is known today. Accolades and Appearances The accolades won by the chorus are numerous: three gold medals at LABBS (1995, 2010 and 2016), three silver medals and a bronze, and a number of independently adjudicated choral competitions, to include the 2010 Good Housekeeping Choir of The Year.

These techniques are applied to asynchronously sampled signals (i.e. with a constant sample rate in Hertz) to obtain the same signal sampled at constant angular increments of a reference shaft. In some cases the outcome of the Order Tracking is directly the Fourier transform of such angular domain signal, whose frequency counterpart is defined as \\"order\\". Each order represents a fraction of the angular velocity of the reference shaft. Order tracking is based on a velocity measurement, generally obtained by means of a tachometer or encoder, needed to estimate the instantaneous velocity and/or the angular position of the shaft. Three main families of computed order tracking techniques have been developed in the past: Computed Order Tracking (COT), Vold-Kalman Filter (VKF) and Order Tracking Transforms.  Computed order tracking  Computed order trackingK.R. Fyfe, E.D.S. Munck, ANALYSIS OF COMPUTED ORDER TRACKING, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Volume 11, Issue 2, March 1997, Pages 187-205 is a resampling technique based on interpolation. The procedure begins by estimating the time instants T_k (k = 1:K) corresponding to integer rotations of the shaft (i.e. angle equal to 2\\\\pi k). Then an angular rotation vector is defined: \\\\alpha _i = 2\\\\cdot \\\\pi \\\\frac{iK}{N} accordingly to the desired angular resolution: \\\\Delta \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{K}{N} A corresponding vector of time instants is obtained by means of a first interpolation step t(i\\\\Delta \\\\alpha) = \\\\text{interpolation}(\\\\\\\\{ 2\\\\pi k , T_k \\\\\\\\} , \\\\alpha _i) A second interpolation step is then applied to obtain the angular resampled signal x(i\\\\Delta \\\\alpha) from the original time domain signal x(j\\\\Delta t): x(i\\\\Delta \\\\alpha) = \\\\text{interpolation}(\\\\\\\\{ x(j\\\\Delta t) , j\\\\Delta t \\\\\\\\} , t(i\\\\Delta \\\\alpha))  Vold-Kalman filter  Vold-KalmanH. Vold, J. Leuridan, High resolution order tracking using Kalman tracking filters-theory and applications, SAE Paper No. 951332, 1995. filter is a particular formulation of Kalman filter, able to estimate both instantaneous speed and amplitude of a series of harmonics of the shaft rotational velocity.  Order tracking transforms  Order tracking transforms are mathematical transforms which perform in a single step both the order tracking (synchronization of the signal domain with the reference shaft) and the Fourier transform to assess amplitude and phase of each order of the so obtained spectrum. With such transforms it is possible to directly assess the amplitude of a synchronous, sub-synchronous or super-synchronous shaft-locked harmonics, without an additional resampling step. The most recent formulation of such transforms is the Velocity Synchronous Discrete Fourier Transform,P. Borghesani, P. Pennacchi, S. Chatterton, R.

Imran Khan was born on 5 October 1952 in Lahore to father Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and mother Shaukat Khanum. He grew up as the only son in the family, with four sisters. The family are ethnically of Pashtun origin. Paternally, Khan belongs to the Niazi Pashtun tribe which has long been settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab. Khan's mother hailed from the Burki Pashtun tribe settled in Jalandhar, Punjab, which emigrated a few centuries ago from South Waziristan in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan. Khan's maternal family has produced several great cricketers, the most prominent of whom are Javed Burki and Majid Khan. From 1995 to 2004, Imran Khan was married to Jemima Goldsmith, a British socialite turned writer and activist, and member of the influential Goldschmidt family of England. They have two sons from the marriage, Sulaiman Isa Khan (born 1996) and Kasim Khan (born 1999). The marriage ended amicably in divorce in 2004. In early 2015, Khan announced his marriage to the British Pakistani journalist Reham Khan. The marriage lasted nine Months and ended in divorce on 30 October 2015. In 2018, he married Bushra Maneka, who was previously his spiritual mentor. Elementary family Wives Imran Khan's third wife is Bushra Bibi. =Jemima Goldsmith= Jemima Khan. On 16 May 1995, Khan married Jemima Goldsmith, in a traditional Pakistani wedding ceremony in Paris. A month later, on 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond registry office in England, followed by a reception at the Goldsmiths' house in Surrey which was attended by London's elite. The wedding was named by the media as \\"The wedding of the century\\". Jemima Marcelle Goldsmith is the eldest child of Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart and Billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith, who was one of richest men in UK. Goldsmith enrolled at the University of Bristol in 1993 and studied English, but dropped out when she was married in 1995. She eventually completed her bachelor's degree in March 2002 with upper second-class honours. In 2003, she received her MA in Middle Eastern Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, focusing on Modern Trends in Islam. The marriage, described as \\"tough\\" by Khan, ended in 2004 after nine years. Shortly after their marriage, Imran and Jemima arrived at Zaman Park in Lahore from their honeymoon at one of the Goldsmiths' farms in Spain, and were greeted by international and local reporters. It was also announced that Jemima had converted to Islam and she would use 'Khan' as her last name. As an agreement of his marriage, Khan spent four months a year in England and the rest in Lahore. The marriage produced two sons, Sulaiman Isa (born 18 November 1996) and Kasim (born 10 April 1999). During the marriage Jemima actively participated in a Khan led charity drive for the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre and also supported her husband in starting his initial political career. Rumours circulated that the couples marriage was in crisis. Jemima placed an advertisement in Pakistan newspapers to deny them. It read: \\"Whilst it is true that I am currently studying for a master's degree at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, it is certainly not true to say that Imran and I are having difficulties in our marriage. This is a temporary arrangement.\\" On 22 June 2004, it was announced that the Khan had divorced ending the nine- year marriage because it was \\"difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan\\" despite both their best efforts. The marriage ended amicably. Khan described the six months leading to the divorce and the six months after as the hardest years of his life. After the divorce Jemima returned to Britain with the boys. According to the divorce settlement, Khan's sons visit him in Pakistan during their school holidays while he stays with his former mother- in-law, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, when he comes to London to see them. According to Jemima, Imran and she have remained on very good terms even after the divorce. =Reham Khan= In January 2015, Imran Khan married British Pakistani journalist and television anchor Reham Khan, after months of speculation. The marriage was conducted via a simple nikah ceremony at Khan's residence in Bani Gala. The marriage ended in divorce nine months later, in October 2015. Reham is an ethnic Pashtun, belonging to the Lughmani sub-clan of the Swati tribe. She hails from Mansehra in the Hazara region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and speaks the local dialect Hindko, in addition to Pashto and Urdu. =Bushra Bibi= Khan married Bushra Bibi, who was in her 40s, on 18 February 2018 at his residence at Lahore.\\"PTI confirms Imran Khan's marriage to Bushrangers Maneka in Lahore\\",Dawn, 18 February 2018.

Children Khan has two sons from his marriage with Jemima, Suleiman Isa Khan (b. 18 November 1996) and Qasim Khan (b. 10 April 1999) Following their divorce, Jemima returned to England with their sons. As per a mutual settlement, Khan's sons visit him in Pakistan during their school holidays while he stays with his former mother-in-law, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, when he visits London to see them. In addition to these, there is an allegation claiming that Imran has a child other than Suleiman and Qasim. Khan's alleged partner Sita White took a legal action against Khan. The court ruled that Tyrian Jade White is his daughter.\\"Imran Khan may take custody of daughter\\", hellomagazine.com. Retrieved on 1 August 2018 However, Imran Khan has denied these allegations. In response to Califorinian court ruling. Imran Khan said Fri, 15 August 1997, 01:00 \\"As I do not live in California or in England, my response is to welcome Sita White to Pakistan, where I live,\\" he said. \\"And I would more than welcome the opportunity to present my side of the story in a Pakistani court rather than conducting an undignified trial by media. \\"I will, of course, be prepared to submit to a blood test in Pakistan and will fully stand by the decision of the competent Pakistani courts.\\" Immediate family Parents Khan was born in Lahore, the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife Shaukat Khanum. A quiet and shy boy in his youth, Khan grew up with his four sisters in relatively affluent (upper middle-class) circumstances and received a privileged education. Khan's parents were moderate and practicing Muslims. Khan's father, Ikramullah Khan Niazi, was born in Mianwali on 24 April 1922. He was a civil engineer who graduated from the Imperial College London in 1946. Ikramullah was a staunch supporter of the Pakistan Movement during the days of the British Raj and was \\"fiercely anti-colonial\\"; he would tell off local waiters at the Lahore Gymkhana Club who would speak to him in English. He worked in the Pakistan Public Works Department. He was also a philanthropist, founding a charity called the Pakistan Educational Society which \\"funded the university education of underprivileged but talented children.\\" Ikramullah Niazi served as a board member of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre during his later years. He died on 19 March 2008 at the age of 85 from pneumonia, after a protracted illness for which he was being treated at Shaukat Khanum cancer hospital. He is buried at the family's ancestral graveyard in Mianwali. Khan's mother, Shaukat Khanum, was a housewife. She was born in Jalandhar, before the partition of India.Did you know Imran Khan has a Jalandhar connection? He credits his mother as having played a deeply influential role in his upbringing. In 1985, she died due to cancer. The helplessness and personal experience of seeing his mother diagnosed with cancer, which became the cause of her death, motivated Khan to build a cancer hospital in Pakistan where those who could not afford expensive care could be treated. In 1994, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre was founded by Khan in Lahore, and named in memory of his mother. A second Shaukat Khanum cancer hospital has been inaugurated in Peshawar, while plans are underway for a third hospital to be located in Karachi. Siblings Khan has four sisters, namely Rubina Khanum, Aleema Khanum, Uzma Khanum and Rani Khanum. Khan's elder sister, Rubina Khanum, is an alumnus of the London School of Economics and held a senior post with the United Nations. Aleema Khanum is an entrepreneur and philanthropist who is the founder of a Lahore-based textile buying house, CotCom Sourcing (Pvt.) Ltd. She graduated with an MBA from the Lahore University of Management Sciences in 1989. Her textile buying house has served textile retailers and agents across the globe, and maintains representative offices in Karachi and New York. Aleema served as marketing director for the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust, and played an instrumental role in fundraising efforts for the hospital. She is a member of the board of governors of the hospital. She is also a member of the board of the Imran Khan Foundation and Namal Education Foundation, and several charitable and social welfare organisations including the Hameed Muggo Trust and the SAARC Association of Home-Based Workers. Of Khan's other sisters, Uzma Khanum is a qualified surgeon based in Lahore while Rani Khanum is a university graduate who coordinates charity activities. Shortly after her marriage to Imran Khan, Jemima acknowledged the support she received from Khan's sisters while adjusting to life in Lahore and described them as \\"educated, strong women, with lives of their own.\\" Paternal family Khan's father belonged to the Niazi Pashtun tribe, who were long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab.Encyclopaedia Asiatica, Comprising Indian Subcontinent, Eastern and Southern Asia: H. Jangtang By Edward Balfour Published by Cosmo Publications, 1976 Item notes: v. 4 Original from the University of Michigan Page 188 The Niazis had come to the subcontinent with invading Pashtun tribes during the fifteenth century. Imran identifies Haibat Khan Niazi as a paternal ancestor, a sixteenth century military general of Sher Shah Suri and later governor of Punjab. His paternal family hail from the Shermankhel sub-clan of the Niazis. The Niazis mainly speak Saraiki and are based in Mianwali and surrounding areas, where family and tribal networks are strong and where, according to Khan, \\"even third cousins know each other\\". Grandparents Imran Khan's paternal grandfather, Azeem Khan Niazi, was a physician. The ancestral haveli (mansion) of Khan's paternal family is located in Shermankhel Mohallah, Mianwali, and is known as Azeem Manzil (named after his paternal grandfather, who built it), where Khan's extended relatives still reside.Imran Khan's Haveli in Mianwali, Samaa News It is spread over an area of ten kanals, and the family's ancestral graveyard where Imran's paternal grandfather, grandmother as well his father are buried, lies nearby. Khan kicked off his political campaign from Mianwali in 2002, winning his first seat in the National Assembly from the city which he calls his hometown. Uncles Azeem Khan Niazi had four sons: Ikramullah Khan Niazi (Imran's father), Amanullah Khan Niazi, Zafarullah Khan Niazi and Faizullah Khan Niazi. In Memory of My Father, The Nation Imran's paternal uncle Amanullah Khan Niazi was a lawyer and politician who was a senior member of the Muslim League. Zafarullah Khan Niazi was a businessman. Imran's father Ikramullah and uncles Zafarullah and Amanullah previously resided in the family haveli. It is now the property of Khan's cousin, Inamullah Niazi. Cousins Zafarullah Khan Niazi had several sons, including Khan's paternal cousin Inamullah Niazi; a politician and former parliamentarian who was a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) for nearly two decades, before becoming senior vice-president of Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf in Punjab in 2013. He later rejoined the PML (N), following a dispute over election ticket distributions. Inamullah's brother and occasional columnist Hafizullah Niazi is also Imran's brother-in-law, through cousin marriage to Imran's sister. They have other brothers, including Irfanullah Niazi, Abdul Hafeez Niazi (a politician and former member of the Punjab provincial assembly),Niazi brothers bid adieu to PML-N, Dawn and their youngest brother, the late Najeebullah Khan Niazi, politician and former member of the Punjab provincial assembly.Member Profile, Punjab government According to Dawn, many members of Khan's paternal tribe, and particularly his cousins, have been traditional supporters of the PML-N, even after Khan founded his own party. The newspaper noted that Khan's ancestral home functioned \\"partially as a local office for the PML-N\\" and that instead of Khan, the family home featured posters of the Sharifs and pictures of other family members. Inamullah was reportedly unhappy when he was snubbed and not given an election ticket from the PTI's platform, causing Inamullah and his brothers to part ways with Khan and heavily criticise him on the media. Commenting on the bitter family politics, Khan once said: \\"What should I say? It is a family matter. They are my brothers, Hafizullah and Saeedullah, and their contributions to PTI are great. Inamullah was new to the party... but I did [what I thought was fair].\\" Another cousin, Saeedullah Khan Niazi was the president of the PTI in Punjab. He also has a cousin, Ahmed Khan Niazi, who served as his head of security. Maternal family Khan's maternal family belongs to the Burki Pashtun tribe (also known as the Ormurs), who originated in Kaniguram in South Waziristan, located presently in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan. There are various theories about the origins of the Burkis, including one which states that they migrated from Turkish Kurdistan over at least eight centuries ago, and settled in the mountains of Kaniguram. Kaniguram was a historical seat of learning and culture in the region, and has been inhabited primarily by the Burkis since at least the reign of Mehmood Ghaznavi in the 10th century. The Burkis spoke their own dialect known as Ormuri. According to a tribal legend, they may have served as bodyguards for Mehmood Ghaznavi who conquered much of Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of northern India in the eleventh century, and were awarded lands. They made their living as traders, taking horses and silk to India. Some members of the Burki tribe emigrated from Kaniguram around 1600 AD and formed a settlement in the city of Jalandhar (southeast of Amritsar and 40 miles from Lahore; now in Punjab, India), where Khan's mother was born. According to Khan, his maternal family had been based in Jalandhar for over 600 years before migrating to Pakistan after the partition of India. His mother's family played an instrumental role in establishing the Islamia College in Jalandhar. Maternally, Khan is a descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan (also known as Bayazid Khan), a Burki born in Jalandhar who hailed from Kaniguram.Will Imran Khan go to Kaniguram? The Express Tribune. 8 September 2012. According to a Burki historian, K. Hussain Zia, the Burki emigration from Kaniguram was prompted by a severe drought; \\"The elders decided that some people would have to leave in order for the others to survive. It was thus that 40 families bade farewell to Kaniguram. The entire population walked with them for some miles and watched from the top of a hill till they were out of sight.\\" These forty caravans would eventually arrive in Jalandhar, an area which the Burkis were already acquainted with previously, on account of their trading routes to India via the Grand Trunk Road. In Jalandhar, the Burkis established fortified villages referred to as \\"bastis\\". To preserve their ethnic identity and keep their Pashtun culture intact in India, they did not marry outside their tribe. Khan's maternal family lived in twelve fortresses in an area in Jalandhar founded by the Burkis known as the Basti Pathan (lit. Pathan Colony). Khan's maternal grandfather, Ahmed Hasan Khan, was a civil servant and known to have hosted Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Founder of Pakistan, at Basti Pathan. Until the 18th century, the Jalandhar Burkis retained ties and trading links with their kinsmen back in Kaniguram. However, these links were cut off following local instability during Sikh resistance against the Mughal Empire. As a result of this, the Jalandhar Burkis lost much of their language and cultural traits, adopting the Punjabi language. Following the partition of India and the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the entire Burki clan migrated to Lahore in Pakistan, escaping the carnage and violence that ensued during the partition. In Lahore, the Burkis settled in an affluent area which came to be known as Zaman Park, and it was here among his maternal family where Imran Khan spent much of his youth growing up. The area is named after Imran's maternal grandfather's brother (i.e. grand-uncle), Khan Bahadur Mohammed Zaman Khan, who settled in Lahore before the partition and was serving as postmaster general for the undivided Punjab Province. When the Burkis from Jalandhar arrived to Lahore, they took shelter in Zaman's house and eventually took up surrounding houses vacated by Hindus who left for India. Thus, all of Imran's maternal family established themselves in Zaman Park. Imran's parents built their house in the same area, which he now owns. Imran grew up playing cricket with his cousins in the neighbourhood. The name Zaman Park came from the presence of a park, around which the houses were located. Imran Khan's maternal family is known for its sporting tradition; the Burki clan has produced a long line of cricketers and played an influential role in Pakistan's cricket history. Eight of his cousins played first-class cricket. The most prominent of them are Javed Burki and Majid Khan, who went on to represent the national team and served as captains. In total, up to forty members of the Burki tribe have at some point played first-class cricket in British India or Pakistan. Two of Imran's mother's cousins also captained the Pakistan national field hockey team. Grandparents Imran's maternal grandfather Ahmad Hasan Khan was born in 1883, and his father (Imran's maternal great-grandfather) had also been a civil servant. He entered the Government College Lahore in 1900, and was reputed in sport, captaining the cricket and football teams at the college. After completing his studies, Ahmed entered the government service. At the height of his career in civil service, he served as the census commissioner of Punjab. He was posted in various areas, including a posting as a District Commissioner in Mianwali (the hometown of Imran Khan's paternal family). Writing on his maternal grandmother, Khan said that his mother would \\"make us children go to see our maternal grandmother with our cousins every day for half an hour. These evenings with her were most enjoyable. She would know everything that was going on in our lives. In fact she would get involved in all our problems and we would tell her things that even our parents would not know.\\" According to Khan, his grandmother died at the age of a hundred and \\"all her mental faculties were fully intact.\\" He also writes that his grandmother died shortly after his own mother died in 1985, and that she might have lived longer but could not get over the loss; \\"my mother being her youngest child... It almost seemed as if she decided it was time for her to go. She refused to get out of bed and three months after my mother's death she passed away.\\" Uncles and aunts Ahmed Hasan Khan had four daughters: the eldest, Iqbal Bano, followed by Mubarak and Shaukat (Imran's mother). Another sister is said to have died early. Ahmed Raza Khan (Imran's maternal uncle) was the only son. Lieutenant General Ahmed Raza was known affectionately by his friends as \\"Aghajan\\", and entered the military service. He also played fifteen first-class cricket matches in India and Pakistan, playing for Northern India followed by Punjab. He later served as a national selector at the Pakistan Cricket Board. Imran's eldest maternal aunt, Iqbal Bano, was married to General Wajid Ali Khan Burki, a high-ranking military official and physician in the Pakistan Army. Imran's second aunt, Mubarak, was married to Jahangir Khan. Jahangir was a cricketer during the British Raj era who played for India and later served as a cricket administrator in Pakistan post-independence. Cousins Nausherwan Burki is a US-based physician and pulmonologist who played an instrumental role in setting up Imran's Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital and serves in its board of governors; he was also among the original founders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf in 1996. Wajid and Iqbal Bano's second son, Javed Burki briefly played cricket for Pakistan during the 1960s and also captained the national side. After retiring from cricket, Javed served as secretary to the Ministry of Water and Power of the Government of Pakistan. Their third son Jamshed Burki, was a retired army major and civil servant who served as a political agent in the Khyber Agency of the tribal areas, among many other important posts, and went on to become the Interior Secretary of Pakistan. Jahangir Khan and Mubarak's eldest son Asad Jahangir Khan won an Oxford Blue in cricket and was a first-class cricketer in Pakistan. Their second son, Majid Khan became a cricket legend who captained the national side of Pakistan during the 1970s. Majid's son Bazid Khan is also a cricketer who has played at the national level. Another distant cousin, Humayun Zaman, played first-class cricket between 1956 and 1971. Extended family Imran's nephew Hassan Niazi headed the Insaf Students Federation, the student wing of the PTI. He also has many other nephews. PTI's Additional General Secretary Saifullah Niazi belongs to the Niazi clan and is a distant relative. Pakistani cricket captain Misbah-ul- Haq also belongs to the Niazi tribe in Mianwali and shares blood relations with Imran Khan paternally.\\"Like Imran, Misbah is a Niazi\\" The Telegraph. 2 January 2013. One of his father's cousins, Sajjad Sarwar Niazi, was a poet and music composer who served as the director of the Peshawar Radio Station, while his daughter Nahid Niazi earned fame as a singer. Nahid was married to a prominent Bengali music composer Moslehudin, and her sister Najma Niazi was also a popular singer. Shaukat Khanum's cousin Mrs. Lt Col. Zaheer-ud-Din, has two sons Lt. Col. Muhammad Omer Khan and Muhammad Ali Khan, who is a banker serving as a Vice President in MCB Bank Limited. Her grandson, Moin Khan holds a record for traveling from California, America to Lahore, Pakistan on a sports bike. Imran's uncle Jahangir's brother-in-law Baqa Jilani also played cricket for India. Jilani's nephew, Sherandaz Khan, was a first-class cricketer, and another distant cousin of Imran from the Burki tribe. He was also the first bowler to dismiss Imran in first-class cricket. The Pakistani economist Shahid Javed Burki is a nephew of Wajid Ali Khan Burki and an extended relative of Imran. Imran Khan is said to be a distant cousin of the British-Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, who had a relationship with Lady Diana. He is also a cousin of one of Pakistan's leading English-language columnists, Khaled Ahmed, who belongs to the Burki tribe. Lawyer and PTI member Hamid Khan is also a relative. Imran's great-uncle Khan Salamuddin and many members of Salamuddin's extended family also made a name in cricket. Many family relatives of Imran, from both the paternal and maternal sides, have served in the Pakistan Armed Forces. Major-General Bilal Omar Khan, who died in the 2009 Rawalpindi mosque attack was from Khan's maternal family. Another extended relative, General Zahid Ali Akbar Khan, was an engineering officer in the Pakistan Army, director of the nuclear Project-706, and later chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.

He is principally remembered for his five tragedies. Life Pomponio Torelli was born in 1539 at Montechiarugolo near Parma, which until the creation of the Duchy of Parma in 1545 was in the Duchy of Milan. He was the third son of Paolo Torelli (1509 – 1545) and his second wife Beatrice Pico della Mirandola (died 1546), who was the great-niece of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. In 1545 Torelli's father died and he succeeded at the age of six to the title of Count of Montechiarugolo; his mother died in the following year. He was tutored at home by Andrea Casali, then studied at Padova under Bernardino Tomitano and Francesco Robortello. In 1566 he was knighted by the second Duke of Parma, Ottavio Farnese, and made ambassador to Flanders. In 1573 he married Isabella Bonelli, great-niece of pope Pius V and sister of cardinal Michele Bonelli. The third Duke of Parma, Alessandro Farnese, appointed Torelli tutor to his son Ranuccio Farnese, and entrusted him with diplomatic missions in Flanders and in Spain. Under the nickname Il Perduto, \\"the lost one\\", Torelli was a leading figure in the Accademia degli Innominati, a society of learned and literary men founded in Parma on 13 June 1574, which ceased activity in 1608, the year of Torelli's death. Pomponio Torelli died in Parma on 9 April 1608. A portrait of him by Cesare Aretusi was commissioned in 1602 by Giovan Battista Masi, who married Torelli's daughter Clelia in 1604 and who, with Torelli's son and heir Pio, was among those beheaded on 19 May 1612 for involvement in the Congiura dei feudatari, or \\"plot of the feudal lords\\", against Ranuccio Farnese. The painting is now in the Galleria Nazionale di Parma. Works Torelli wrote love poetry in the style of Petrarch; his Rime were published in 1575, with an expanded edition in 1586, and his Scherzi poetici in 1598. His six books of Carmina in Latin were printed in Parma in 1600. His Trattato del debito del cavaliere (1596) and Trattato delle passioni dell’animo contain his Neoplatonist philosophical discussions of affects, emotions and the duties of the knight. He is however principally remembered for his tragedies: La Merope was published in 1589, Il Tancredi in 1597, La Galatea in 1603, and La Vittoria, on Pietro della Vigna, and Il Polidoro both in 1605.

Its gross water storage capacity is 6 Tmcft. The reservoir water spread area extends up to the toe of the Nagarjuna Sagar dam. The project was completed by July 2014. 810 MW peaking power station at the toe of Nagarjuna Sagar dam Hydro electricity generation Two units of 25 MW each hydro power generation units were commissioned in the year 2017 by APGENCO to utilize the head available across the dam from the river flood water and the water released to Prakasam Barrage requirements. Peaking power generation Presently, the 700 MW reversible hydro turbines (7 x 100 MW) located at the toe of Nagarjuna Sagar Dam are unable to operate in pumping mode due to non availability of tail pond for storing the released water during the power generation mode. With the completion of tail pond, surplus electricity from the electricity grid would be used for pumping the water back to the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir and recycled for meeting peaking load on daily basis. Thus surplus electricity is consumed when it is available and used to meet the peak electricity requirements without letting the water out of the Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond. 700 MW peaking power for eight hours duration can be met from the one Tmcft of live storage water capacity available in the tail pond. Irrigation potential 200 Tmcft surplus water annually from the Godavari River is planned to be fed into this tail pond by the Dummugudem Lift Irrigation Scheme which is under execution. The water transferred to this tail pond will be pumped to the upstream 410 Tmcft gross water storage capacity Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir to feed its right and left bank canals. Thus Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir need not receive the water supply from the upstream Srisailam reservoir. As the tail water level (48.33 m MSL) of this dam is below the full reservoir level (53.34 m MSL) of the downstream Pulichintala dam, surplus water in Pulichinthala reservoir can be pumped by envisaging pumped storage units from Pulichinthala reservoir to Nagarjunasagar reservoir via this pond. The retained water in the Srisailam reservoir would be used for upstream water uses from Jurala and Srisailam reservoirs for irrigation needs in uplands of Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. The water from the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir can also be pumped to the Srisailam reservoir by Srisailam left bank hydro electric power station (900 MW) in pumping mode in case of severe drought in Krishna river basin. Koilsagar lift irrigation project (near ), Rajiv Bheema lift irrigation project, Nettampadu lift irrigation project (near ), Kalwakurthy lift irrigation scheme, Srisailam Left Bank Canal, Telugu Ganga irrigation project, Handri Neeva lift irrigation project, Galeru Nagari irrigation project, Veligonda irrigation project etc. which are in advanced stage of construction, are depending on the Krishna river water available at Jurala / Srisailam dams. A lift canal from the Krishna river ( at 20 m MSL) downstream of Pulichintala dam will be executed to feed Godavari water diverted from Polavaram to some of the existing command area (situated below 60 m MSL) under Nagarjuna Sagar right bank canal to facilitate extension of Nagarjuna Sagar right bank canal connecting to Kandaleru feeder canal / Somasila reservoir.  Alternate to Dummugudem to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond link canal Dummugudem to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond link canal is entirely located in Telangana region and needs to be routed through high lands which necessitate more pumping head. An alternative link canal to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond from Polavaram dam is also economically feasible to transfer Godavari water. This link canal passes entirely through the coastal Andhra Pradesh region only. Joint projects with Karnataka The Rajolibanda barrage is not receiving adequate continuous flows due to excessive water utilization in its catchment area in Karnataka. The lower Tungabhadra basin badly needs water augmentation from the adjacent Krishna river. This is achieved with a 20 km long tunnel from Narayanpur reservoir to the Maski nala reservoir / tank situated at 475 m MSL for drawing nearly 250 tmcft Krishna river water. It would also provide additional water to bring more area under irrigation in uplands of Raichur & Mahboobnagar districts. Reliable Krishna river water can be supplied instead of unreliable Tungabhadra river water to the existing Tungabhadra Left bank canal in Raichur district, existing Tungabhadra right bank low level canal, the existing Rajolibanda left bank canal and the existing 150 years old K. C. Canal. Thus substantial Tungabhadra reservoir water would be saved for utilization in upstream new projects and reliable Krishna river water supply is ensured to existing projects. A new barrage (FRL 349 m MSL) across the Krishna river just downstream of Bhima river confluence point on the common border of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh states (near ), can also be taken up to supply Krishna river water by lift irrigation to the westernmost parts of Mahbubnagar district and high lands lying east of Bhima river in Karnataka. Ultimately, 500 tmcft water is to be transferred annually from the Godavari river to this pond for meeting various water needs in Andhra Pradesh. Thus Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond will play pivotal role to put to use the water from the Godavari River in all regions of the Andhra Pradesh state.

Overview The Club's main aim for the 2001–02 season was to win the Swiss Nationalliga A championship title. The second aim was to win the cup title. Their third aim was to stay in the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup as long as possible, if possible win the final and thus to advance to the UEFA Cup. New with profession contracts for the new season, and brought up from their reserve team, were Philipp Degen and Marco Streller. Further, Pascal Zuberbühler returned from a one-year loan with Bayer Leverkusen. Basel's biggest signing for the new season were Scott Chipperfield, who came from Wollongong Wolves, and Christian Eduardo Giménez, who was signed from Lugano. Basel started the season of with various warm-up matches. These included teams from the Nationalliga A and the Nationalliga B. The Campaign Domestic League The Qualification Round to the League season 2002–03 was contested by twelve teams and started on 4 July 2001. The season started in the worst possible way, Basel were beaten 8–1 in the away game against FC Sion. The afore mentioned Marco Streller was to play his League debut in St. Jakob-Park being substituted in during the 66th Minute on 11 July 2001 in the 3–1 home win against Servette. Unluckily in the last minute of the game he scored an own goal. It was to remain his only game for Basel in this season because he was loaned to feeder club FC Concordia Basel for the rest of the season. Christian Eduardo Giménez was to play his debut on 18 July in the 3–3 draw with St. Gallen and his first goal for the club was to follow during the 3–1 home win against the Young Boys on the 11 August. Giménez was to end the season as the top scorer in the Swiss league. After five games Basel were straggling after achieving just one win and one draw, opposed to three defeats. Hereafter things turned for the better and despite two further defeats, and despite that these were in the two matches against the reigning title holders Grasshopper Club Zürich, Basel ended the qualification leading the league table. The first eight teams of the qualification then competed in the Championship Playoff Round, which started in the new year. Each team took half of the points (rounded up to complete units) gained during the Qualification as Bonus with them. With ten wins and just one defeat in the first eleven games, Basel pulled away at the top of the table to win the championship three games before the end of the season. Basel thus achieved their main aim for the season. This was their first title after 22 years of waiting. Domestic Cup Basel's clear aim for the Swiss Cup was to win the title, especially because the final was to be played in St. Jakob-Park. In the round of 32 and the round of 16 Basel were drawn with an away game against lower league teams Concordia and Colombier, both games were won without conceding a goal. In the quarterfinal Zürich were beaten 4–1 away from home. The semifinal against Young Boys ended in a draw after extra time, but Basel won after penalties. The Final was won in extra time against the Grasshoppers thanks to a penalty scored by Murat Yakin after Boris Smiljanić cleared a ball on the line with his hand. Basel thus also achieved their second aim. Europe In the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup, which started for Basel on the first of July, Basel were drawn against Iceland's Grindavík. With two victories Basel won 5–0 on aggregate. The next round saw them matched against SC Heerenveen, a Dutch club from the Eredivisie. Again two straight wins saw Basel advance with a 5–3 aggregate. The semifinal was an all Swiss affair with local rivals Lausanne being beaten 5–2 on aggregate. The Finals were played against Aston Villa, which the Premier League team won 5–2 on aggregate. Basel achieved their minimum aim for this competition.

It was the scene of a skirmish between European militia and Maori rebels on 7 June 1869 in which nine members of the militia were killed. The Opepe Maori settlement was at the intersection of two major pre-European walking tracks (Taupo-Napier and Urewera-Tokaanu). It was the birthplace of the Maori leader Te Rangitahau. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"place of the moth\\" for Ōpepe. During Te Kooti's War, in early June 1869 Te Kooti and about 150 of his supporters moved towards Lake Taupo in the center of the North Island. At Opepe, just short of Taupo, they ran into party of fourteen Militia, who were camped in the abandoned village. Nine of the militia were killed with no loss to Te Kooti. One of the men, who was drying his uniform, escaped completely naked across rough country in mid- winter, and was awarded the New Zealand Medal. A military stockade was built at Opepe in 1869 but closed in 1885. The township thrived for several years in the late 19th century. Today there is a very small cemetery on the Napier- Taupo road with five graves maintained by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Two of the graves hold the bodies of the nine members of the Bay of Plenty Cavalry who were killed on 7 June 1869 by Te Kooti's advance guard. The other three are the graves of later settlers. New Zealand State Highway 5 passes through Opepe today. Little remains of the settlement.

The band members were Rosendo Mercado as guitarist and vocalist, Chiqui Mariscal as bassist and Ramiro Penas on drums. When they started to record their first album Leño, Chiqui Mariscal left the band and Tony Urbano entered as the new bassist in order to complete the recording. This line up would continue until their break-up in 1983 at their peak of popularity. In 2012 the band was ranked number 13 on Rolling Stone's \\"50 Greatest Spanish rock bands\\".  History  After finishing the compulsory military service in 1975, Rosendo took part recording the first album for the band Ñu. Molina and he were not on very good terms, so Rosendo left the group in 1977, and formed Leño, playing the guitar and singing. Chiqui Mariscal (bass player) and Ramiro Penas (drums) also left Ñu to join him in Leño. They made their debut in 1978, as supporting band in a concert of Asfalto. They had been hired by Vicente Romero, who was setting up Chapa Discos (\\"Chapa Records\\"), and published the collective disc Viva el Rollo, Vol. II. Rock del Manzanares, including two songs: Este Madrid and Aprendiendo a escuchar. In 1979 they published their first album, titled Leño. The album, produced by Teddy Bautista, contains songs with long instrumental sections, among which El tren and Este Madrid are remarkable. During the recording Mariscal left the group, and was substituted by Tony Urbano, as portrayed in the disc cover. Later it would be ranked as the 106th best Rock en Español album according to American magazine Al Borde. In 1980 they published their second album, Más madera. Teddy Bautista's influence can be seen in that the songs are shorter and have a lighter style. In 1981 they recorded in the Carolina club the En directo live disc. The disc sold very well, even though the recording quality was not very good. This disc includes one of Rosendo's best-known songs, Maneras de vivir. Luz Casal (chorus) and Teddy Bautista (keyboards) play with them. The last official disc of Leño, ¡Corre, corre!, was made with more resources, thanks to the success of their previous one. It was recorded at Ian Gillan's recording studio located in London, with the production of Carlos Narea. Notable songs include Sorprendente and ¡Qué desilusión!. The intention was to achieve prestige both inside and outside Spain but when the critics of Kerrang! evaluated the album, the result was awful. Some of them claimed that was impossible to rate the album because of the language. Later, in 2012 the album would be ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone's \\"50 Greatest Spanish rock albums\\". In 1983 they took part in Rock de una noche de verano, a tour organized by Miguel Ríos that would become a milestone in the Spanish rock history, by organizing a long series of concerts all around Spain, with big sound and light resources. In the 1983 fall, in their best success moment, they decided to break up. Chiqui Mariscal died in 2008. In 2010, the band reunited for the release of their album tribute Bajo la corteza: 26 canciones de Leño to perform a short concert.

Frontera Women's Foundation states its goal is \\"promoting positive social change for women and girls along the border\\" and focuses its campaign on community service and issues of women's rights at the family, community, and organizational level. The FWF supports grassroots organizations on the U.S. Mexico border. The region extends from Southern New Mexico, through El Paso County, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to Brownsville, Texas. The Frontera Women's Foundation supports these organizations by providing grants to groups that support women and girls struggling with issues such as low socio-economic status, gender bias, and ethnic bias.  History  Established in 2003, Frontera Women's Foundation is one of the first women's funds in the state of Texas. The foundation was established to support organizations addressing the unique needs of women living on the border.  Origins  The founders of the Frontera Women's Foundation are women who live and work along the U.S. Mexico border. The Frontera Women's Foundation was established to address the scarcity of resources for community based non-profits in that particular area. The Foundation specifically focuses on organizations that support women and girls of the border region. The FWF's gender focus acknowledges the fact that the border region faces national issues such as family violence, economic development and access to health care. Women and children comprise the majority of those living at the national poverty level. The FWF was formed to provide effective programs and strategies that specifically address the needs of this historically underserved population.  Mission statement and purpose  Frontera Women's Foundation raises money to support the work of non-profit organizations that serve low-income women and girls. The Foundation aims \\"to promote social change, provide health care, ensure economic justice, end gender violence and encourage education and workforce development.\\" Money raised by the Foundation is gifted in the form of grants to organizations that support the mission statement. Some of the grant-making directly supports low- income communities on both sides of the Rio Grande borderline to encourage grassroots capacity building linked to sustainable development. In 2005 FWF completed its first round of grant-making and has awarded more than $160,000. The FWF supports a range of projects including direct services, counseling, support groups, education, self-esteem and personal development. The Foundation works with organizations that support the intellectual, cultural, social, and personal needs of women and girls.

Goederede Tower) is a gray square brick tower in Goedereede, Netherlands, high, belonging to the Catharina church. It was built in 1512. From 1552 to 1912 the tower served as a lighthouse, and went through various changes during this period. Today it has been restored and is a museum, housing a carillon. Church tower The original tower was part of a large parish church in the then-prosperous fishing and trading port. Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens (1459–1523), the future Pope Adrian VI, was pastor of the church. During a great fire in Goedereede in 1482 the old \\"Katharina Church\\" and its tower were destroyed. A new church was erected in 1512 beside a giant new tower, which still stands today. A large bell that sounded the hours was cast in 1519, with the Latin inscription, Est mea vox grata, quia sum Maria vocata et Georgius Waghevens Me fecit Anno Domini MCCCCCXVIII (My voice is welcome, because I am called Maria and George Waghevens made Me in the year of our Lord 1518.) A second bell was added in 1647. Lighthouse The tower and the windmill in 1910 Although at first unlit, the tower served as a landmark to help ships navigate. From 1552 the tower served as a lighthouse. The light originally came from an open coal fire. Goederede went into a long decline, losing trade to better-sited ports. There were insufficient funds to maintain the church. In 1706 the dilapidated building was pulled down, but the tower was preserved. In 1823, the spire of the church was removed to improve use of the tower as a lighthouse. On 26 February 1834 a high light with optics was installed. The optics were replaced in 1879. In 1908 the tower was equipped with rotating optics with a light intensity of 180,000 candlepower. In 1912 the lighthouse was extinguished when the West Head Lighthouse in Ouddorp came into use. Museum In 1967 the tower was designated a national monument (Rijksmonument). From 1973 to 1978 the tower was restored at a cost of over two million euros, and made into a museum. A carillon of bells were hung in the tower, which can be played either mechanically or by hand. The carillon of 37 bells was inaugurated on 24 June 1978. In 1999 it was extended with six bass and seven treble bells. Two more bells were added in 2010, providing many more options to the player. In April 2011 the Dutch Carillon Society organized an international competition for carilloneurs, each of whom had twelve minutes to perform.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 12, 2013, and is written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Mike Kim. In the episode, after Peter buys a farm to get away from Quahog's rising crime problem, he becomes a meth dealer. Plot Tom Tucker and Joyce Kinney do a news report on rising crime in Quahog. Glenn Quagmire is mugged by a criminal who doesn't know who Truman Capote was. At Quahog's Ocean World, a seal named Bojangles threatens his trainer for her bucket of fish and forces her to rub his belly. At the hospital, a woman gives birth to a baby who starts shooting everything. Some days later, the Griffins return home to find they have been robbed. After losing their peace of mind, Peter buys a farm and tells the family they are moving, selling their house on Craigslist. Despite some initial reservations, the family decides to go along although Brian is suspicious of their motives for taking him to a “farm” (thinking they will euthanize him) and briefly takes Stewie hostage. Arriving, they adjust to farm life. But Lois delivers news that they are hemorrhaging money and are in danger of losing the farm. Brian offers to go to college to learn something of value in farming to help out and heads out. During a tornado, the Griffins take shelter in a storm cellar and discover a methamphetamine lab. Lois wants to call the police, but Peter decides to use it to get back on their feet. Despite her reservations, she agrees to make meth just long enough to get profitable. Peter becomes paranoid as he develops a carrier pigeon delivery system as Stewie buys decongestants. Brian returns to find that the farm and the family have gone to hell and are only wearing their underclothes (except for Meg who is unconscious for some reason). A news report reveals that the family is responsible for a flood of drugs into Quahog, Tricia Takanawa and almost everyone else hooked on meth, worsening the crime problem. Lois, distraught by how their business is destroying Quahog and changing the Griffins for the worst, packs up and convinces everyone to go back home. Peter at first is reluctant to leave, but changes his mind when he suddenly remembers the lab going haywire at the moment, thus blowing up the farm immediately. Eventually, they're back at their original house, having managed to buy it back after property values plummeted during the crime wave. When Jodie Sweetin comes looking for a taste of their drugs, Peter has the family hide out while he takes care of the situation. Reception The episode received a 2.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic and was watched by a total of 4.82 million viewers. This made it the most watched show on Fox's Animation Domination line-up that night, beating The Cleveland Show, The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers and American Dad!. The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying \\"To be fair, it’s not emphasized enough just how volatile all those chemicals can be, and as an ending to one of the standard episode types for this show—Peter initiates family upheaval—it swiftly shows Lois’ reversal to be correct. It’s a quick way to end the episode, and it makes Brian’s small subplot a bit of a dead end, but when there are so many cutaways, an already thin plot gets thinner.\\" Mark Trammell of TV Equals gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"Farmer Guy” was close enough for disco, and it was certainly one of the best, if not the best episode of the season, and it’s precisely because it went back to the style it’s most famously known-for, not in defeat, but rather because it actually had a solid plot and some good jokes to tell. Sometimes, it’s the simplest solutions that work best, like going back to the basics.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode two out of five stars, saying \\"Really, when the best humor is all but disconnected from the actual plot of the episode, that's a bad sign. I didn't see any real reason to care about this, and why should I? If any serious work was put into this episode, it was wasted.\\" References External links * Farmer Guy at Family Guy Wiki * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 11) episodes Category:Television episodes about illegal drug trade ","title":"Farmer Guy"},{"id":"39360516","text":"Breck's Mill Area, also known as Breck's Mill Area-Henry Clay Village Historic District, is a national historic district located along Brandywine Creek at Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware.

On January 22, 2013, NBC placed a pilot order under the title Happiness. The pilot was written by Victor Fresco and directed by James Burrows. Burrows had previously worked with Hayes on Will & Grace. Casting announcements for the remaining series regular roles began in February 2013, with Linda Lavin cast in the role of Lorna, Sean's tough and assertive mother. Echo Kellum was the next actor cast in the series, in the role of Hunter, one of Sean's co-workers, who is very passionate about his music, art, photography and poetry. Thomas Lennon then joined the series in the role of Max, the new owner of the online retail company where Sean works. In late- February, Samantha Isler joined the cast as Ellie, Sean's quick-witted daughter. Shortly after, Lindsay Sloane boarded the series as Liz, Sean's co- worker and best friend, a former therapist. Vik Sahay later signed onto the series in the recurring role of Howard, a slightly aggressive IT guy, who works alongside Sean. On May 9, 2013, NBC placed a series order, under the new title Sean Saves the World. Two days after the series order, Lindsay Sloane exited the role of Liz: Megan Hilty was cast soon after. On November 8, 2013, NBC ordered an additional five episodes for the first season, bringing the total to 18 episodes. With few exceptions, Sean Saves the World was shot on a closed set with a laugh track added during post-production, a point several critics have derided. Jodi Walker from Entertainment Weekly commented on Hayes' animated performance — dubbing it \\"flailing\\" — by saying, \\"flailing is key to cueing this show’s laugh track.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commented, \\"why would we want their jokes to succeed or fail based on their own merit when a laugh track can tell us what is funny and exactly when to laugh?\\" Ed Bark of National TV Reviews & News added that \\"Hayes seems wedded to the old-time sitcom religion, which calls for multiple cameras...and a laugh track...his is the only NBC comedy series with such additives, but Hayes gets a bit snippy when asked if it’s a format he favors.\\" Beginning with Episode 12 (\\"The Wrath of Sean\\"), a live studio audience is utilized for scenes taking place in Sean's apartment and workplace.tvtickets.com Episodes Release and home media On March 24, 2014, the last two filmed episodes became available on iTunes. The entire series is available as a made- on-demand DVD set from Universal Studios Home Entertainment. Reception The show has received mixed reviews from critics. Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald gave the series critical acclaim saying \\"Sean Saves the World is like a comedy cruise to self-discovery, with both Sean and his daughter learning of strengths and weaknesses they didn't know they had, the process punctuated with keenly funny dialogue and precision timing\\". David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the show 2 out of 5 stars.

She was killed by a mob of anti-apartheid activists who suspected her of being an informant. Her horrific death by \\"necklacing\\" stunned the world and became emblematic of the violence of the anti-apartheid struggle. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has identified Skosana as the first known victim of necklacing, although it is more likely that she was not the first such death, only the first filmed. Death Maki Skosana, 24, was an unmarried factory worker and single mother to a five-year-old son. On July 20, 1985, the 24-year-old Skosana was the first of a series of victims in South Africa to be filmed being killed by necklacing. Necklacing was a brutal practice that occurred in townships. Skosana's death occurred in the township of Duduza, west of Nigel on the East Rand, Gauteng. Suspected of being a police informer, Skosana was held responsible for her perceived involvement in the deaths of four youth activists. Their deaths were reportedly planned by the \\"Third Force\\": a supposed group of covert government operatives tasked with managing township resistance. Hundreds of people came out for the two funerals, and footage of the crowds was broadcast live on television. It was because of her presumed role as a police informer that she was killed whilst attending the funeral of a friend, who was among four people murdered. She had decided to attend the ceremony, even though it was the funeral of one of the people she had allegedly been implicated in killing. While it was Joe Mamasela, under command of his superiors (including Jack Cronje, Johan van der Merwe, Johann Coetzee and even the then president P. W. Botha, who had planned their deaths, it was because of an assumed connection to him that Skosana was believed to have been associated to the explosion that led to their deaths. When she arrived at the funeral the vigilantes necklaced her as a public display of their disapproval of the hand grenade bombings. After the funeral, a mob of 500 people chased Skosana from a cemetery across a field. The mob seized her, beat her with clubs, and then knocked her to the ground and kicked her until she was semi-conscious and half-naked. A large rock was put on her so she could not get up. They put a tire around her neck, doused her with gasoline and set her on fire. Evelyn Moloko, Skosana's sister, said Skosana was burned to death with a tire around her neck while attending the funeral of one of the youths. Her body had been scorched by fire and some broken pieces of glass had been inserted into her vagina, Moloko told the committee. Moloko added that a big rock had been thrown on her sister's face after she had been killed. Film footage of necklacing Television cameras captured her death on live broadcast. The graphic images of her death depict her having a tire (doused in petrol) put around her neck and then set alight, burning her to death. These images of her death, filmed by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), were rebroadcast by the apartheid state media in anti-resistance propaganda. Skosana's death was the first time that a necklacing had been caught on camera. Legacy Although it was originally believed that she had an affiliation to the deaths of the activists,\\"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\\", \\"Human Rights Violations\\", Date of hearing: 04.02.1997, Case: JB0289/013ERKWA-DUDUZA it was not until her story was dealt with in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that it was discovered that she had simply been \\"at the wrong place at the wrong time.\\" Her sister, Evelina Puleng Moloko, testified on Skosana's behalf at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, at which time Maki Skosana was found innocent of the accusations brought against her. The commission found that Skosana \\"was wrongly accused of being an informer and responsible for the death of the 'comrades' in the booby-trapped hand grenade incidents.\\"\\"Necklacing of Maki Skosana\\", \\"Crime in South Africa\\", 2008 In light of this new evidence, Skosana and her family can now be seen \\"as heroes\\",\\"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\\", \\"Human Rights Violations\\", Date of hearing: 04.02.1997, Case: JB0289/013ERKWA-DUDUZA instead of traitors.

Like Cruithne, it does not orbit the Earth in the normal sense and at times it is on the other side of the Sun, yet it still periodically comes nearer to the Earth in sort of halo orbit before again drifting away. While not a traditional natural satellite, it does not quite have normal heliocentric orbit either and these are sometimes called quasi-satellties or horseshoe orbits.  Discovery, orbit and physical properties  was discovered by James V. Scotti on 20 January 2013, observing for the Spacewatch project from Kitt Peak (KPNO).Discovery MPEC Its orbit is characterized by low eccentricity (0.084), low inclination (0.77º) and a semi-major axis of 0.993 AU; it is the most Earth-like among those of asteroids moving in Earth-like orbits. Upon discovery, it was classified as an Aten asteroid but also an Earth crosser by the Minor Planet Center. Its orbit is well determined; as of 26 August 2015, its orbit is based on 96 observations spanning a data-arc of 375 days. has an absolute magnitude of 25.9 which gives a characteristic diameter of 30 m. Radar observations indicate that it may be a very rapid rotator with a period of just a few minutes.  Horseshoe companion to the Earth and orbital evolution  Recent calculations indicate that it follows a horseshoe orbit with respect to the Earth. Its orbital evolution is highly chaotic and its orbit is difficult to predict beyond a few thousand years. As for the available data, it had its closest encounter ever with Earth on 12 February 2013 at 0.013 AU, closer than in 1934, the previously closest approach at 0.014 AU. The next approach closer than 0.020 AU will take place on 2 September 2090 at 0.016 AU. Its orbit matches the expected properties of that of an object in the Arjuna class.  Origin  2013 BS45 may have originated within the Venus-Earth-Mars region; alternatively, it may have come from the main asteroid belt like other Near-Earth Objects, then transitioned to an Amor-class asteroid before entering Earth's co-orbital region.
