It is located in Rome, Italy. History General Dwight D.Eisenhower The idea of a NATO Defense College originated with General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe, who identified very early on the need for a new international institution with a unique education mission. On 19 November 1951, the NATO Defense College opened its doors to Course 1 in Paris. In 1966, France withdrew from the Alliance's integrated military structure and the College moved to the EUR quartier of Rome, where it continues to fulfil its mission. On 10 September 1999, the new College building, twice the size of the old one, was inaugurated in Cecchignola Citt√† Militare, a military zone 2 km from the former site. On 13‚Äì14 October 2016, the NATO Defense College celebrated the 50th anniversary of its move to Rome and the 65th anniversary of its foundation.  Mission In response to Strategic Guidance issued to the NDC by the North Atlantic Council and the NATO Military Committee (MC123/8), the NDC Mission is: * Contribute to effectiveness and cohesion of Alliance * Foster strategic level thinking on pol-mil matters * Develop major center of education, study, and research: ** Prepare selected officers and officials for important NATO and NATO-related multinational appointments ** Conduct academic studies and research in support of the Alliance's wider goals ** Support an active outreach programme with other educational institutions  Organization The commandant is an officer with the rank of Lieutenant- General; on November 29, 2016 Lieutenant-General Chris Whitecross (Royal Canadian Air Force) assumed command. To accomplish its mission the College is organized into four main divisions that perform education and research tasks coordinated by the dean (civilian equivalent of a 2-star general) of the College. The divisions work closely together to provide breadth, flexibility and quality of high-level strategic education. The Director of Management (a Brigadier General) supervises management of the NDC's financial and technical resources with the aim of improving the quality of life in the College and creating the best conditions for work and study.  Core business = Education = Six regular courses are held at the College: *The Senior Course: The most important course at the NDC. It lasts 5¬Ω months and runs twice a year. Some 15 weeks are spent in the College, with the rest of the time on Field Studies. There is a 2-3 day crisis management exercise at the end of the Course. The Course is open to officers (Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels) and civilian officials and diplomats (of equivalent rank). Over 200 attend each year (approximately 25% civilian). The Senior Course is open not only to NATO nations but also to Partnership for Peace-Mediterranean Dialogue-Istanbul Cooperation Initiative nations, Contact Countries and Iraq. *Generals, Flag Officers & Ambassadors' Course (GFOAC): This high-level course seeks to enhance mutual understanding of security concerns and of NATO's interests and capabilities among Generals and Flag Officers and high-ranking civilians including ambassadors from NATO, PfP, Med Dialogue and ICI nations, Contact Countries & Iraq. It also provides opportunities for networking among one- to three-star officers and civilians of equivalent rank. *NATO Regional Cooperation Course (NRCC): Commissioned by the North Atlantic Council at the Riga summit in 2006, after two years of preparation the NRCC was inaugurated at the College in 2009 to link issues of concern to both MD and ICI Nations and NATO, and to develop mutual understanding and networking among participants. It shares lecturers with the Senior Course (40% of the time), and also has its own separate facilities and lecturers, mostly from the ME region, and its own Faculty Advisors and staff. The NRCC offers a ten-week academic programme twice each year. *Modular Short Courses (MSCs): The NDC offers five MSCs during every Senior Course for the duration 5 days. This is an opportunity for military officers and civilian officials who may not be able to attend the NDC for a six-month period. Each MSC is designed to both inform and stimulate the participants by providing the opportunity to improve their knowledge and develop their understanding of some of the key political, economic, socio-cultural, defence and security related issues which may have worldwide implications for global and Alliance security. *Senior Executive Regional Conference (SERC): This week-long conference is dedicated to a select, high-profile group of diplomats, senior officials, high-ranking officers, policy planners and researchers, from NATO member states as well as from the Alliance's partner countries in the Gulf and Mediterranean area. Participants successfully engaged in an intensive week of study, dialogue and open discussion on the strategic issues which are currently of particular relevance to the security of the countries represented. *Integrated Partner Orientation Course (IPOC): The aim of the Integrated Partner Orientation Course (IPOC) is to improve participants' knowledge of the NATO Alliance; its missions, roles and priorities; its internal structures and organisation; and its external relations with partner nations and international institutions. The course examines the way in which each of these elements is evolving to reflect changes in the international security environment, which is similar to the structure of the NDC Senior Course. = Research= Research at the NATO Defense College, carried out by the Research Division (RD), provides the NATO's senior leaders with timely analyses and recommendations on current issues concerning the Alliance. The activities of the RD can help to convey NATO's positions to the wider audience of the international strategic community. The RD performs its tasks mainly through research papers ‚Äì short academic essays and academic reports, and forum papers ‚Äì in-depth studies, analyses and reports. Over the last year, the Research Division published about 20 studies and analyses, about 30 articles in journals (International Herald Tribune, International Affairs, Defense News, Politique √âtrang√®re, Washington Times, etc.), was regularly quoted in the New York Times, Newsweek, Le Figaro and news agencies, etc. The RD also organized 8 conferences and workshops and co-facilitated Reykjavik Conferences on Arctic Security and a Military Committee workshop on the Strategic Concept. = Outreach activities= The NDC has four main outreach activities:  The Conference of Commandants (of Defence Colleges) Which has a dual purpose. *firstly, to facilitate the exchange of information between those responsible for higher defence education with a view to improving curricula and teaching methods; *secondly, to promote cooperation in higher defence education between colleges in NATO countries and their counterparts in central and east European and Mediterranean Dialogue countries.  Kyiv Week NATO's support for senior military education in Ukraine started with the first \\"International Week\\", held in February 2001. Since then a similar course has been running every year involving more than 500 participants at a time. The formal aims of the International Week are: *to improve knowledge of NATO, its organization and working methods; *to discuss the challenges facing the Atlantic Alliance and its partners in today's security environment; *to address key, current issues in the field of international security; *to demonstrate the importance of a strong partnership between Ukraine and NATO.  The Partnership for Peace Consortium of Defense Academies and Security Studies Institutes Was established in 1999 at the Washington Summit as a Consortium of the Willing and founded in the spirit of Partnership for Peace (PfP). By Military Committee direction, the NATO Defense College \\"is the focal military point of contact within NATO\\" for the consortium, composed of 300 organizations in 46 countries. The NDC is actively involved in 6 of the 10 working groups.  Advanced Distributed Learning ADL's goal is to provide learning systems that are both more effective and more cost-effective. Course members must follow at least one of the three different ADL courses, to ensure that they have all attained the same level of knowledge before embarking on the Senior Course. The Introduction to NATO (the NATO Defense College is the content provider for this course); European Security and Defence Policy, and RMA - the Revolution in Military Affairs.

It is thus defined as the compatibility or equivalence between a prospective husband and his prospective wife which should be adhered to. This compatibility is dependent on multiple factors that include religion, social status, morality, piety, wealth, lineage or custom.  Legal Rulings  Islamic scholars (ulama) hold differing opinions and arguments on the doctrine of Kafa'ah based on the Quran and Hadith. What is consistently agreed upon by the four Sunni Madhabs is the compatibility of religion. Muslim women can thus marry only Muslim men, but Muslim men are also permitted to marry Jewish or Christian women. In Shia Islam, there is no concept of Kafa'ah on the basis of lineage. = The Hanafi Position = According to the traditional Hanafi school of thought, kafa'ah represents a special proportionality between a man and a woman in marriage. = The Maliki Position = The traditional Maliki position states that kafa'ah is the proportionality in religion for both husband and wife who are not in disgrace so it allows the woman to exercise rights to decide her marriage. = The ShƒÅfi'i Position = According to the ShƒÅfi'i school of thought, kafa'ah concerns the factors of lineage, religiousness, profession, and being free of defects that permit annulling the marriage contract (nikah). It must not be misunderstood as a recommendation of whom to marry. Rather, it should be taken as a legal restriction to protect a woman's interest in her marriage. If a woman wishes to marry someone who is seemingly incompatible based these factors, there is nothing wrong in her doing so. Accordingly, an Arab woman should not marry a non-Arab man; similarly, a virtuous woman should not marry a corrupt man, (though it is sufficient should the husband give up his wrongdoing). A daughter of someone with a higher profession should not marry a man of a lowly profession. The wealth of either parties is not a factor to be considered, as it is merely temporary and \\"those with self-respect and intelligence do not take pride in it.\\" = The Hanbali Position = Scholars of the Hanbali school of thought state that kafa'ah represents the similarities and proportionality based on five factors, namely, religion, lineage, independence, jobs and wealth.  Objectives  The main goal of Kafa'ah is to make a peaceful and lasting marriage. The argument is that a household built based on the common perceptions, equivalent views, and understandings would make a peaceful and happy marriage. However, if such a rationale is to be accepted, it raises the question as to why these restrictions only apply to a prospective wife and not the husband. An objective more congruous with the legal rulings would be to protect the interests of the prospective wife by ensuring that she is not in disgrace in her conjugal bond. This however, raises the question as to why it would be a disgrace for an Arab woman to marry a non-Arab man.  The Hadhrami Controversy  = Social Stratification Between Sayyids and Non-Sayyids = The controversies associated with the doctrine of kafa'ah were exemplified in a chain of events which occurred in Hadhramaut, Yemen, in 1905. People of the Ba 'Alawi sada, especially of Hadhrami descent, adhered to a stricter and more rigid system of social stratification based on the kafa'ah of descent. In particular, a Sayyid woman is prohibited from marrying a non-Sayyid man. This extreme position is absent in the canon of orthodox ShƒÅfi'i scholarship, the school to which the Hadramis otherwise adhered. Controversy erupted when a number of marriages between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men were publicly discovered, which thus became a subject of public condemnation and clamour because of their perceived unsuitability. = The Dissent by Rashid Rida and Ahmad S≈´kartƒ´ = In response to the heated controversy, an Islamic reformer by the name of Rashid Rida argued that such marriages were valid and permissible, in his journal al-ManƒÅr in Egypt. There was nothing in Islamic law, as he argued, that prohibited marriages between Sayyid women and non- Sayyid men. Rida's views were echoed by Ahmad Surkati, who wrote a pamphlet in 1915 titled Surah al-JawƒÅb (The Form of the Answer) in permitting such marriages based on the principle of equality. According to Surkati, kafa'ah should be restricted to the rationale of ensuring a good relationship between the partners; accordingly, if a woman decides to marry someone seemingly inferior, because \\"of other such qualities which please women\\", she is allowed to do so. It must be stressed again that the traditional Hadhrami interpretation of kafa'ah (in restricting marriage between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men) is not found in the canon of orthodox Islamic scholarship. The arguments promulgated by Rida and S≈´kartƒ´ are thus merely a defense of traditional Islamic scholarship as much as they are a rejection of Hadhrami societal attitudes determined by self-interest. = Rebuttal by Sayyid Umar al-Attas = These arguments, however, were strongly rebutted by Sayyids, one of whom was Sayyid Umar al-Attas, a leading Hadhrami scholar residing in Singapore, who declared such marriages to be unlawful. In doing so, he identified four levels of compatibility based on descent (which always applies for women and not for men, i.e., a man can marry someone from a lower rank, but a woman cannot): Arabs must not marry non-Arabs, Qurashƒ´s must not marry non-Qurashƒ´s, HƒÅshimites must not marry non-HƒÅshimites, and descendants of Hasan and Husayn must not marry anyone other than other Hasanids and Husaynids. In his book published in 1905, The Marriage Between A Sharifah and A Non-Sharif and Esteemed Position of Ahl al-Bayt, he concluded that it is impermissible for a Sayyid woman to marry a non-Sayyid man, even if it is based on her own desires or with the consent of her wali. Additionally, AbdullƒÅh Da·∏•lƒÅn attacked Surkati's stance that all humans were equal, arguing instead that God had created some humans like the Prophet's family as superior to others. The dispute quickly deteriorated into racist diatribes. Da·∏•lƒÅn reportedly remarked about Sukarti, \\"Will the Negro stand corrected of his saying or persist in his stubbornness?\\" Other Hadhrami Sayyids insulted Sukarti by calling him \\"the black death\\", \\"black slave\\", \\"the black\\", \\"the Sudanese\\" or \\"the Negro\\", all while claiming that he could not speak Arabic and that he was a non-Arab. = Consequences = The far-reaching consequences of this heated discussion went beyond the doctrine of kafa'ah and sparked a power struggle in Hadhramƒ´ communities in South East Asia. People began to openly question the rigid system of social stratification dominated by the Sayyids, their status and privileges. Some of the practices that became publicly contentious include the custom of taqbil (kissing the hands of Sayyids), and the exclusive use of the title, \\"Sayyid\\" itself.

Early life and career Dowie's parents, Ann and Alan Dowie, were both police officers. At age 15 in 1990, she was a member of a semi-professional dance group that performed in the Soviet Union. Before her election to Parliament, she worked as a lawyer. Dowie attended the University of Otago, studying law and ecology. After graduating, Dowie worked for the law firm Macalisters and later the Department of Conservation. Dowie joined the National Party and was affiliated with their \\"Blue Greens\\" environmentalist faction. Political career Dowie was selected by the National party to replace retiring MP Eric Roy in the electorate; at the time, she had a low profile. In the , she won with a large margin to Labour's Lesley Soper. She was returned again in 2017 with a slightly reduced margin, but still beating Labour candidate Liz Craig, who was elected to parliament from the Labour list. She also defeated sitting New Zealand First MP Ria Bond, who was too far down the list to be re-elected. On 25 January 2019, Dowie was revealed as the MP who had an affair with fellow MP Jami-Lee Ross. Ross had disclosed this in October 2018, but the news media chose not to name her at the time. After it was learned that a police investigation had been launched into a text message allegedly sent by Dowie to Ross, media revealed her identity. However, the police decided that no further action was needed. In 2019 Dowie was re-selected by National in Invercargill unopposed, but in February 2020 announced her decision not to stand for re- election. Political and public views and statements Dowie has defended recreational whitebaiting. Dowie also criticised the Labour-led coalition government's plans to merge the country's polytechnics into a single entity. In particular the Southern Institute of Technology, one of the most successful polytechnics with reserves of over $30 million and a surplus of $4 million stating that the merger would cost jobs and cause Southland to lose its competitive advantage and respond to market needs. As National's spokesperson for conservation, she was critical of the Labour-led coalition's plans to cull Tahr without consultation with the hunting fraternity and led a campaign to \\"Stop the Tahr Cull\\" where over 25,000 signed the petition. Dowie is responsible for a member's bill entitled the Shark Cage Diving (Permitting and Safety) Bill which was drawn from the ballot in September 2018. This bill seeks to ensure both people and sharks' safety should it become law. Currently it is an unregulated activity. Personal life Sarah Dowie is married to Mark Billcliff, a former first class cricketer for Otago, but it is understood they have separated. Dowie has two young children.

Identification and name  The Cleveland Shale was identified in 1870 and named for the city of Cleveland, Ohio. John Strong Newberry, director of the Ohio State Geological Survey, first identified the formation in 1870. He called it the \\"Cleveland Shale\\" and designated its type locality at Doan Brook near Cleveland. Details of the type locality and of stratigraphic nomenclature for this unit as used by the U.S. Geological Survey are available on-line at the National Geologic Map Database.https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/search  Description  The primary minerals in the Cleveland Shale are chlorite, illite, pyrite, and quartz. Underground, the Cleveland Shale is black, dull grayish-black, bluish- black, or brownish-black in color. In exposed outcrops, it weathers to red, reddish-brown, or medium brown. Highly weathered rock turns gray. It is fairly fissile, breaking into thin, irregularly shaped sheets or flakes that occasionally display crystals of pickeringite. Relieved of stress once exposed, the Cleveland Shale is nonplastic and can appear as if fragmented into blocks due to jointing. = Pyrite basal boundary = There is a sharp and clear distinction between the Cleveland Shale and underlying Chagrin Shale. At the very bottom of the Cleveland Shale there is a thin, discontinuous layer of pyrite. This pyrite layer is discontinuous because after this rock was laid down, it was eroded. The erosion increases as one moves south along the valley of the Cuyahoga River and east to the Grand River. Portions of the pyrite layer, known as Skinner's Run Bed, contain fragments of petrified wood and fossilized fish bones worn smooth by the action of water. Above the pyrite layer, a limestone layer is found in west- central (but not eastern) Ohio. The remainder of the Cleveland Shale generally consists of a relatively hard, organic rich oil shale. It has both an upper and lower part. = Lower part = A clay shale, described as bluish or bluish-gray and as olive-black to brownish-black, forms the lower part. The lower part can be anywhere from a few inches to several feet in thickness. Thin beds of gray or brown siltstone, lumps of pyrite, and layers of silica- heavy limestone with cone-in-cone structures are found in the lower part. In eastern Ohio, thin gray veins (\\"stringers\\") of siltstone appear. In western Ohio, the Cleveland Shale appears to interbed with the Chagrin Shale below it, erasing the clear boundary between the two rock formations. = Upper part = The upper part of the Cleveland Shale is a black to brownish black silty shale with occasional thin beds of gray shale and siltstone. The upper part is much richer in petroleum and kerogen. When broken open, fresh samples smell like crude oil. Where the upper part is thick, and particularly in northeast Ohio, the shale has a distinctive \\"rippled\\" appearance. The upper of the Cleveland Shale contains abundant nodules of phosphate, nodules and bands (extremely thin beds) of pyrite, bands of calcisiltite, and lamination. Almost no concretions are found in the upper part.  Geographic extent  A thick sequence of the Cleveland Shale exposed on the north bank of the Rocky River in North Olmsted, Ohio. For scale, note the paleontologists just right of center at the base of the cliff. The Cleveland Shale is a shale geologic formation in Ohio in the United States. The Cleveland Shale underlies much of northeast Ohio in beds of varying thickness. In northeast Ohio, the member does not appear east of the Grand River. Measurements taken in northeast Ohio show the Cleveland Shale to be to thick. It is thickest around the Rocky River north of Berea, Ohio, and thins to the east, west, and south. The Cleveland Shale is found in east-central Kentucky. In east-central Kentucky, the Cleveland Shale is more uniform in thickness, ranging from , and increases in thickness toward the east.

Stratigraphic Setting  The Cleveland Shale (or Cleveland Member) is a sub-unit of the Ohio Shale Formation. The Chagrin Shale underlies the Cleveland Shale. The Bedford Shale generally overlies the Cleveland Shale, with a sharp distinction between the two. In west-central Ohio, more than of Bedford Shale may lie above the Cleveland Shale. In places, red and grey shale may intertongue (interlock) with the Cleveland Shale extensively. In far eastern Ohio, the Bedford Shale thins by more than . Where the Cussewago Shale is also present, the Bedford Shale is usually less than and may be locally absent. In some areas, the Cleveland Shale is described as overstepped or unconformably overlaid gradationally by Berea Siltstone and sharply by Berea Sandstone. It is the regional equivalent of the Hangenberg Sandstone.  Fossils  Exceptional marine animal fossils are found in the formation. The Cleveland Shale is generally considered to be fossil-poor, but there are exceptions. The basal pyrite layer contains petrified wood and fossilized fish bones. The upper part is famous for its extensive and well-preserved fossil Chondrichthyes, Conodonts, Placodermi, Cladoselache, and Palaeoniscinoids. The giant predatory placoderms Dunkleosteus terrelli, Gorgonichthys clarki, Gymnotrachelus hydei, Heintzichthys gouldii, and five subspecies (including the type specimen) of Titanichthys were all discovered in the Cleveland Shale. The Cleveland Shale is classified as a konservatte-lagerstatten, which means it often preserves complete body fossils. Typical early shark preservation includes soft tissue outlines and impressions, fin rays, gill musculature, cartilage, and stomach contents.  Age  The Cleveland Shale is approximately 360 to 358.9 million years old, dating to the latest Devonian; the Famennian stage.  Interpretation of depositional environments  The Cleveland Shale is likely the regional expression of the Dasberg event, a major extinction event that occurred near the end of the Devonian period. The Cleveland Shale is interpreted as having accumulated in an anaerobic environment. Evidence exists to suggest that the Cleveland Shale was laid down during the Dasberg event, an Upper Famennian extinction event that devastated land-based flora and marine- based fauna. This led to a significant drop in marine oxygen (an anoxic event) and atmospheric carbon dioxide, and then a brief glaciation. The global environment recovered, only to suffer another extinction, the Hangenberg event, close to the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. While the Cleveland Shale was being deposited, extensive organic matter from the land was swept into the sea then lying over Ohio. Although there is dispute over how deep this sea was, the Dasberg event meant that oceans could support few to no bottom- dwelling animals. This explains why the Cleveland Shale largely lacks fossils of benthic organisms and has a high carbon content that colors the shale very dark gray to black. The contact between the Chagrin Shale and Cleveland Shale has been described as interbedding. This feature is interpreted as having been caused when two different depositional environments (in this case, the oxygenated sea which laid down the Chagrin Shale and the anaerobic sea rich in organic matter which laid down the Cleveland Shale) moved repeatedly back and forth over the same area. Geologist Horace R. Collins called the boundary area intercalated, but it is unclear what meaning he intended. Different hypotheses have been suggested as the cause of the regional, irregular contact between the Cleveland Shale and Bedford Formation. Charles E.B. Conybeare has noted that the Cleveland Shale is siltier in the east and more calcareous in the west. He hypothesized that this indicates that silt flowed into the sea from east to west. Current eroded the Cleveland Shale and then laid down new sediment in the gullies which became the Bedford Formation. Jack C. Pashin and Frank R. Ettensohn proposed a variation on this hypothesis. They note that the region containing the Cleveland Shale was undergoing uplift when the Bedford Formation was being deposited. This likely led to exposure and erosion of the Cleveland Shale, with sediment which became the Bedford Formation filling in these gullies. They also observe that there is evidence of diapirism (the intrusion of deformable Cleveland Shale upward into the more brittle Bedford Formation), as well as intertonguing. Baird et al. note that the Cleveland Shale also tilts downward to the south. They suggest that this caused overstepping, rather than intertonguing.  Economic geology  The high organic content of the Cleveland Shale makes it eminently suitable for the formation of fossil fuels. One 1981 study found that the Cleveland Shale can yield an average of of petroleum per of rock. The Cleveland Shale also contains cannel coal and \\"true\\" coal, although neither in great quantity.

The Chagrin Shale is a gray shale that begins thin and deep underground in north-central Ohio. As it proceeds east, the formation thickens, rises to the surface, and contains greater amounts of siltstone. Identification and name The Chagrin Shale was identified in 1873 and named for the Chagrin River in 1903. John Strong Newberry, director of the Ohio State Geological Survey, first identified the formation in 1873. He called it the Erie Shale, but it was discovered that the name \\"Erie Shale\\" was preoccupied (already in use). Ohio State University professor of geology Charles S. Prosser further described the formation in 1903, and proposed the name \\"Chagrin Shale\\" because the shale presented such excellent outcroppings near the Chagrin River. Dr. Prosser's suggested nomenclature was adopted. Details of the type locality and of stratigraphic nomenclature of the Chagrin Shale, as used by the U.S. Geological Survey, are available on-line at the National Geologic Map Database.https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/search Description The Chagrin Shale is a gray or greenish-gray argillaceous shale consisting of gray siltstone, silty gray shale, soft gray clay shale, and (uncommonly) grayish- black shale. The primary minerals in the shale are chlorite, illite, kaolinite, and quartz. Thin to massive beds of siltstone and sandstone are common. The amount of siltstone increases from west to east, at times forming beds up to thick. Thin layers of ironstone and marcasite, as well as concentrations of marcasite, occur throughout the shale. The Chagrin Shale is classified as a weak to medium-strong rock, with a compressive strength anywhere from to . The strength of the rock is much lower near soil/rock interface (where there is stress relief), and if there is weathering. Geographic Extent The Chagrin Shale is found in north-central and northeastern Ohio, and in northwestern Pennsylvania. The Chagrin Shale reaches a maximum thickness of in eastern Ohio. In Ohio, the Chagrin Shale is thin in the west, and thickens as it proceeds east. The Chagrin Shale also extends south into West Virginia.Ryder, R.T., Swezey, C.S., Crangle, R.D., Jr., and Trippi, M.T., 2008, Geologic cross section E-E‚Äô through the central Appalachian Basin from the Findlay Arch, Wood County, Ohio, to the Valley and Ridge Province, Pendleton County, West Virginia: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map SIM-2985, 2 sheets with 48-page pamphlet. http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim2985 The unit is also present in Kentucky, where it is mapped as the Chagrin Shale tongue of the Ohio Shale.Ryder, R.T., Trippi, M.H., and Swezey, C.S., 2015, Geologic cross section I-I‚Äô through the central Appalachian basin from north-central Kentucky to southwestern Virginia: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map SIM-3343, 2 sheets with two pamphlets (41p. and 102p.). http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim3343 Stratigraphic Setting Schematic showing the graded relationship of the Cleveland Member and Huron Member of the Ohio Shale to the Chagrin Shale. In Ohio, the Chagrin Shale underlies the Cleveland Shale and overlies the Huron Shale. It is a member of the Ohio Shale. The Chagrin Shale grades into and between the Cleveland and Huron Shales. Fossils The fossils found in the Chagrin Shale include the coelacanth fish Chagrinia, plants, and trace fossils including the ichnogenus Chagrinichnites. Age The fossils in the Chagrin Shale indicate that the unit is of the Late Devonian period. More precisely, the Chagrin Shale is of the Famennian stage, which is approximately 365 million years old. Interpretation of Depositional Environments The Chagrin Shale is interpreted as having accumulated in a shallow marine, offshore to nearshore environment of normal salinity and less than 45 meters water depth.Weidner, W.E., and Feldman, R.M., 1985, Paleoecological interpretation of echinocarid arthropod assemblages in the Late Devonian (Famennian) Chagrin Shale, northeastern Ohio: Journal of Paleontology, v. 59, no. 4, p. 986-1004 Economic Geology Hydrogen sulfide and (more frequently) methane gas are found in the Chagrin Shale. On some occasions, these pockets of gas have proven quite large, and when reached by drills have vented for several weeks.

Considered as one of Bulgaria's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Kochev has claimed two career medals (one silver and one bronze) at the World Championships (2001 and 2003), picked up a bronze at the 2005 European Championships in Varna, and achieved top seventeen finishes in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Kochev trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Slavia Sport Club in Sofia, under his head coach Simeon Shcherev. Kochev made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He lost his opening match to Cuba's Alexis Rodr√≠guez without receiving a single point on the morning session, but pulled off a 1‚Äì1 draw to tame Mongolia's Dolgors√ºrengiin Sumyaabazar at the end of the round-robin. Finishing second in the prelim pool and twelfth overall, Kochev's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. When his nation Bulgaria hosted the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Kochev lowered his weight to less than a hundred kilograms to compete in the 97-kg division. Despite being brought by the massive roar of the home crowd, Kochev suffered a disappointing defeat from Russia's Giorgi Gogshelidze (who later represented Georgia in two Olympic Games) in the final match 0‚Äì3, but luckily picked up a silver medal for the host nation. Two years later, at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, Kochev came strong with a bronze medal effort in the 96-kg division, which effectively earned him a ticket to his second Olympics. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kochev qualified for his second Bulgarian squad, as a 30-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by placing third and receiving a berth from the World Championships. Unlike his previous Olympics, Kochev made an embarrassing exit with two straight defeats from Kyrgyzstan's Aleksey Krupnyakov (2‚Äì3) and Uzbekistan's Magomed Ibragimov (0‚Äì3), leaving him on the bottom of the pool and finishing seventeenth overall in the final standings.

Stoughton St. in Urbana, Illinois. Built in 1924, the house served as a warm-air heating research facility administered jointly by the National Warm-Air Heating and Ventilating Association and the University of Illinois Department of Mechanical Engineering. Prior to the 1920s, the American heating industry had few formal testing procedures for their products, and home heating through warm-air ventilation ducts was still considered a novel concept. The National Warm-Air Heating and Ventilating Association began to test heating methods and systems in the Department of Mechanical Engineering's laboratories, but it eventually needed a model house in which to test its domestic heating systems. The two organizations commissioned the large Colonial Revival residence, which was designed by architect Loring Harvey Provine and graduate student Clarence Andrew Kissinger. Beginning in 1932, research on air conditioning and cooling systems was also conducted in the house.

A long period (Mira-type) variable, its apparent magnitude ranges from 6.6 to 9.8 over 530 days. Hence at its brightest it is barely visible with the unaided eye in a rural sky. A red giant, it had been classified by SIMBAD as ranging between spectral types SC4.5/8-e and SC7/8-e, but appears to have evolved into a C-type (carbon star) spectrum by 2011. Ronald G. Welch discovered the star while looking for new variables in October 1969. In the first thirty years since discovery, it has become redder and brighter (mean magnitude changing from 8.047 to 7.762) and its period lengthened by 25% from 421 to 530 days. Retrospective examination of photographic plates taken in South West Africa in 1937 and 1951 and stored at Sonneberg Observatory suggest the amplitude of variation might have been smaller in the earliest records. A study of the star published in 2011 found that the increase in period appeared to have stopped or even begun reversing (estimated at 524 days in 2011), and that the spectral class had changed from SC to C, with carbon emission becoming more prominent. Technetium was also recorded in the emission spectrum and its surface temperature deemed to have cooled to 3000 K. Unusually for a Mira variable, BH Crucis had a double maximum, with two peaks in brightness, reminiscent of an RV Tauri variable. However, with the lengthening of its period, this feature disappeared. Guandalini and Cristallo calculated the luminosity of Mira variables based on their periods. Using a period of 421 days, they calculated the absolute magnitude of BH Crucis to be -4.80. Uttenthaler and colleagues calculated a bolometric magnitude of -5.59. Gaia Data Release 2 gives a parallax of and a corresponding distance of around .

It has a spectral class of F8/G1Ia/abe indicating a yellow supergiant with emission lines in its spectrum. W Crucis varies in brightness between magnitude 8.18 and 9.01 over a period of 198.5 days. Its light curve has been observed to be asymmetric with subsequent maxima differing in height, which is described as the so-called O'Connell effect. A secondary minimum is observed when the brightness drops to magnitude 8.5. The shape and duration of the eclipses show that the two stars are detached and that there is an accretion disk around the primary, more massive, star. Spectral lines can only be seen for one of the stars, a yellow supergiant. The other, more massive, star is hidden within an accretion disk of material stripped from the supergiant. The hidden star has properties that suggest it is a mid-B main sequence star. The two are separated by , about . The hot main sequence star has a mass of , while the supergiant only has a mass of . The supergiant is deformed by the gravity of the more massive primary star, fills its Roche lobe, and is losing mass.

She was student athlete for volleyball, long jump, and other sports, before she moved to Seoul when she was 14. She majored creative writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts. She was the editor in chief of the Seoul Institute of the Arts journal and in 1998 made her literary debut with the short story \\"A Meal in August\\" through the annual spring literary competition sponsored by the Seoul Shinmun. Her published debut was the short story collection ['Shaken'] in (2002) and she has also published \\"Every Day is a Celebration\\" (2004) and \\"Black in Red\\" (2009). Her full-length novel Rina (2006) was serialized in the quarterly Literary Joongang. Kang participated in the Seoul Young Writers‚Äô Festival and the East Asia Literature Forum in 2008. Since 1990, Kang has served as an advisory member of the Korea Dialogue Academy which is involved in various social campaigns including the Christian social movement, environmental activism, and encouraging discussions between different religions. Kang was a visiting researcher at Hosei University in Japan in 2007 and her main interest lies in environmental issues. In 2009. Kang did a guest residency at the International Writing Program of University of Iowa. She was selected for Daesan-Berkeley Writer-in-Residence program, funded by Daesan Foundation, she was in Berkeley, California in 2014.http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cks/writer_in_residence html Work The Literature Translation Institute of Korea summarizes Kang's work as follows: Her first story collection Shaken (Munhakdongne Publishing, 2002) attracted attention for capturing the female consciousness with grotesque imagination. Her second collection Every Day Is a Celebration (Changbi Publishing, 2004) dealt with the existential issues of life in a capitalist society from a broader social perspective. Her third collection Black in Red (Munhakdongne Publishing, 2009), depicts in a cool, understated tone the way in which people of the modern society come to meet and understand one another. Her fourth collection At Night He Lifts Weights(Changbi Publishing, 2011) is strongly colored by urban noir. The stories embody the anxiety of suffering city dwellers in mundane locales damaged by natural disasters. One of the stories in this collection, From Mullae won the Kim You-jeong Literary Award in 2011. The story portrays contrasting images of a female narrator living in a provincial city affected by foot-and-mouth diseases and a young artist living in a major city. Kang's full-length of novel, Rina, the novel bigins with a scene in which twenty-two refugees cross the border. They all escape with the hope of finding a Utopia in the land of P. What awaits Rina, however, is a chemical plant in the mountains, a desert-like field of salt, an isolated village, Siring, a town of prostitutes, and a large-scale industrial complex. Rina makes desperate efforts to settle down wherever she goes, but there is no place for her to stay. The journey of Rina, in which she crosses paths with all kinds of vulgar people, whose business it is to murder and rape, and deal in human trafficking, drugs, and prostitution, is described in a unique tone of black humor, it is difficult to tell reality from illusion in this novel. In the end, Rina goes in the direction of another border, not the land of P, demonstrating the time-old struggle between nations, or borders, and humans.

Through the Local Matters program, each Grill'd restaurant donates $500 monthly to three local community groups split $300 / $100 / $100, with customers voting for their preferred community group by placing a token into a jar.  Controversies  In June 2015 it came to public attention that the Toowong franchise had selected anti-abortion group Cherish Life to receive funds from the Local Matters program. Founder Simon Crowe apologised for the alleged mistake, stating that Grill'd is pro-choice. The restaurant chain encountered controversy in July 2015 when allegations arose that Kahlani Pyrah, a former employee of the Camberwell franchise, had been removed from her position after beginning a wage case with the Fair Work Commission to overturn a contract which set pay below the minimum award rate. Grill'd officially denied the allegations, claiming that bullying of managers was the reason for the dismissal. Pyrah launched a Federal Court case in a bid to get her job back. An interim Federal Court ruling ordered Grill'd to reinstate her, allowing the wage case hearing to go ahead. At the hearing, a ruling by the Fair Work Commission forced Grill'd to raise the wages of employees at its Camberwell franchise to be in line the award rate. Jess Walsh of the hospitality union United Voice said that the ruling was an \\"enormous win\\" for Pyrah and Grill'd employees. A planned unfair dismissal hearing at the Federal Court was called off after Pyrah and Grill'd reached an out-of-court settlement. In May 2016, a staff member at the Point Cook franchise allegedly refused a female customer a two-for-one offer intended to encourage men to bring a friend to the restaurant as part of the company's support for men's mental health. A spokeswoman from the Movember Foundation, the sponsor of the promotion, apologised over the team member's misunderstanding. In 2019 serious allegations were made against Grill‚Äôd by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age concerning misuse of government subsidies to reduce staffing expenses. The coverage also include allegations of \\"serious\\" food safety concerns at 1-in-10 company-owned Grill‚Äôd restaurants.

In 1841 he emigrated to Australia and became a member of the first Legislative Council of Victoria, Australia. He returned to England a wealthy man in 1854, and became the first mayor of Torquay, Devon in 1892. Origins Splatt was born at Northwood Farm in the parish of Chudleigh, Devon, England, the eldest son of John Splatt (born 1780), a yeoman farmer born in Kenton, himself the son of William Splatt of Kenton, by his wife Anne. John farmed at Powderham where in 1805 he married his first wife Fanny Stokes (born 1780) at nearby Kenton Church. Following his wife's early death he moved to Northwood Farm in the parish of Chudleigh, where he remarried to Elizabeth Laskey (1784-1850), widow of Mr Yeo, by whom he had 10 children. The eldest son of this marriage was William Francis Splatt (1811-1892), baptised in Chudleigh Church. He was educated at the well-regarded Kentisbeare School, and later worked at Chudleigh as a solicitor's clerk for Charles Langley. He later moved to Keynsham near Bristol where he became a merchant, and married Elizabeth Satterley Pinsent (daughter of Joseph Pinsent of Lettaford in the parish of North Bovey, a London merchant). Emigration In 1840 Splatt sailed on the 'Theresa', as an emigrant to Australia (where his brother Edmund Laskey Splatt had emigrated shortly before ) together with his wife, his brother Thomas Splatt and his brother-in-law Joseph Burton Pinsent, and having arrived in the Port Phillip District in May 1841, they settled at Melbourne, where they became successful merchants and sheep farmers. He was joined the following year by his elder half-sister, Fanny Splatt (1806‚Äì1895), her husband Thomas Dolling (1810‚Äì1898), and their three children, who farmed at Merri Creek, Pentridge (later known as Coburg), Victoria. William Splatt occupied several pastoral runs on the Glenelg, Loddon and Wimmera Rivers. He became a prominent spokesman for pastoralists, and on 5 September 1851 was elected member for Wimmera in the Victorian Legislative Council. He was sworn-in November 1851 and held the seat until resigning in April 1854. His mother and four of her children perished in the shipwreck of the Orion paddle steamer on a voyage from Liverpool to Glasgow on 18 June 1850 on their way to join William in Australia after he encouraged them to do so. His father survived and was later buried in Kenton Church graveyard, where his gravestone survives, near the church door. A mural monument erected by William Francis Splatt to his mother and siblings lost in the accident survives in Chudleigh Church. Return to England Splatt returned to Devon in 1854. He was by then a wealthy man, and rented Coombe House, the manor house of Gittisham. After moving to Brighton for a short time in the early 1860s, he purchased Abbotsford, a villa on Warberry Hill in Torquay. In 1864 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Devon, and purchased the estate of Flete on the south coast of Devon, where he lived for twelve years, during which time he established a school in the village of Holbeton. He sold the estate in the early 1870s and returned to Torquay, where he lived at The Elms in Barton Road, Torre. Following his wife's death in 1878 he soon remarried to the much younger Mary Gertrude Nantes, daughter of Rev. William Hamilton Nantes of Frome Vauchurch, near Dorchester in Dorset, and niece of Daniel Nantes, Vicar of Powderham 1825‚Äì1877. In 1892 at the age of 81 he was elected as the first mayor of the town of Torquay. He died on 9 November 1892, aged 81 and following an elaborate funeral was buried in Torquay Cemetery, in the grave of his first wife, marked with a large obelisk and inscribed: \\"William Francis Splatt - First Mayor of Torquay - Born at Northwood in the County of Devon - Died at The Elms Torquay - Full of Years and Honour\\".

(1983). Toward a people's health service. London: Zed Books . Over 90% of the population had been provided with vaccination. During the period of the early 1980s, around 11% of the government budget was targeted on health care. The Mozambique civil war led to a great setback in the primary health system in Mozambique. The RENAMO's attack on government infrastructures included health and education systems from 1980 to 1992. Health policy Domestic health policy initiatives have begun making their own contributions to improvements in the country's health care, as well as through collaboration with international aid. In 2005, the Government of Mozambique formulated the National Public Investment plan ‚Äì a nationwide initiative towards poverty reduction and social development. Likewise, in 2015 the Government of Mozambique released Agenda 2025, which highlighted the goals for the countries long term social and economic growth as a framework for international aid partners around the world. In 2013, an integrated three-year plan for improved and expanded investment in public programming was implemented, including public health programming. This plan, along with a medium term expenditure framework and a strategic health sector plan laid forth a plan for the country to develop, monitor, and evaluate poverty reduction and social progression initiatives. Through the duration of these and more social programming in Mozambique post- civil war, an emphasis was placed on improving dispersion of resources for the prevention and treatment of Mozambique's most prevalent health challenges, as well as towards improvement in public health education initiatives as a means of prevention. Substantial improvements in access to healthcare facilities has been made since the turn of the century, with increased governmental expenditure on health, increased funding towards the staffing and training of health facilities throughout the country, and a decrease in the population per clinic average by more than 50% from 1997 to 2007. Medicines The National Health Service depends on external financing to pay for medicine. There is considerable reliance on foreign non-governmental organizations. There is a small private sector in urban areas, and there are still traditional medicine practitioners. In the National Health Service prescribable medicines must be included in the National Medicine Form or in the List of Essential Medicines. Hospital medicine, some basic medicine and medicines distributed by Community Health Workers are free. Medicine dispensed by the primary care network in rural areas is charged at a standard rate of 20 Mozambican metical per prescription. The National Regulatory Authority of Medicines was established in 2017. The State Pharmacies Company runs community pharmacies. There is a black market and counterfeit medicine is circulated. The country has one of the lowest proportions of clinicians in the world. A National Health Service has been established, but only extends to about half the population. Those who can afford to often seek medical attention in South Africa.  History  Four scenes from the first English hospital in Mozambique. The Healthcare System in Mozambique has adopted various policies over the years in accordance with fluctuations in the health status of the population. Mozambique has experienced civic conflict, natural disasters, and more ‚Äì all of which have contributed to the health challenges that the country has faced historically and in present day. One staunch divider of Mozambican history is the Civil War, which raged from 1975 to 1992. This period in history is also useful in defining periods of change in the country's health care administration. Very little research on the subject of health in pre-colonial Mozambique exists today. However, according to historian Mario Azevedo, it has been agreed upon by experts in the field that collective national initiatives in health were not seen in Mozambique prior to the arrival of the Portuguese.Azevedo, Mario Joaquim. Historical perspectives on the state of health and health systems in Africa. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2017. Shortly after Vasco de Gama set foot on East African soil in the 15th century,Bethencourt, Francisco, and Diogo Ramada Curto, eds. Portuguese oceanic expansion, 1400-1800. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. colonization of the country began alongside Catholic intervention. For the next 400 years, it is suspected that like many fellow Sub-Saharan African colonies, Mozambique's health facilities were run by European Catholic missionaries in the area. The Chicuque Rural Hospital opened in 1913. Prior to the commencement of the Mozambican Civil War in 1975, the country had already been facing conditions of hardship since the 1960s. During this time, the country was plagued with violence and poverty in accordance with its struggle for independence from Portugal. Although very little is known about health initiatives in Mozambique throughout the nearly twenty-year period of violent conflict post-independence, it is known that period acted as a precursor and risk factor for many of the most prevalent health challenges the country faces today, due to the infrastructural health, environmental health, and social health impacts of war. = Post Civil War = When the Mozambican civil war concluded in 1992, the country began making progress towards recovery through domestic and international aid initiatives. One of the most notable international aid interventions was the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. In 1996, this initiative began helping governments reduce the debt they were incurring through public health spending, effectively encouraging them to promote these healthy initiatives in their countries. With the aid of this initiative, federal expenditure on health care was able to increase from US$4.6 billion in 1997, to US$7.5 billion in 2002. The funds that governments saved with the help of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative was left in the hands of poverty-reduction strategy papers (PRSP), whose primary responsibility was to ensure access of the poor to social resources - like health care - food security, and government transparency. In Mozambique, two specific initiatives the PRSP pushed were (1) increasing community knowledge surrounding health challenges, diseases, and resources; and (2) preventing and slowing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases around the country through public health campaigns that increased public knowledge about modes of transmission and personal protection against STDs.

Kye was educated at Sambong Public Normal School and took his collegiate education at Toyo University in Japan. Kye's first published work was the poem ‚ÄúThe Shattered Schoolroom‚Äù (Geulbang-i kkae-eojyeo) which was published in the youth magazine New Voice (Sae sori) in 1920. In 1925, Kye won the Coming of Age (Saengjang) literary contest with his poem ‚ÄúO Buddha and Divine Spirits, Spring has Come.‚Äù Kye transferred his attention to short fiction with the publication in 1927 of ‚ÄúMr. Choi‚Äù (Choi seobang) in Joseon Literary World (Joseon mundan), after which he never returned to writing poetry. Like many authors of the era including Yi Sang, he was imprisoned by the Japanese colonial government in August 1943 on charges of ‚Äúdisplaying inadequate reverence for the emperor.‚ÄùAfter Korean Liberation, Kye struggled to maintain a non-partisan position in the atmosphere of growing ideological strife in the Korean literary world. Kye died in 1961 in the middle of serializing the novel Seolsujip in the journal Contemporary Literature (Hyeondae munhak).‚ÄùKang Young-sook\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: His story, Adata the Idiot, was also made into a movie by director Im Kwon- taek. Work The Literature Translation Institute of Korea summarizes Kang's work: :Kye Yongmuk‚Äôs early works of fiction ... evince the influence of socialist thought. Both depict the plight of tenant farmers under vicious exploitation by landlords. When Kye Yongmuk returned to the literary world after a hiatus, however, it was no longer from the leftist perspective that he approached his subject matter. ‚ÄúAdada, the Idiot‚Äù (Baekchi Adada), published in 1935, clearly bears the marks of this shift. A story of a mentally handicapped woman, the text offers a critique of contemporary social mores and the all-encompassing pursuit of material gain, but the economic question is reduced to the level of basic human greed rather than analyzed in terms of class conflict. In subsequent works, Kye Yongmuk began to focus more on the art of writing and appealed to mysticism and complex symbology. Desire for material possessions continued to be deplored as the root of much evil in such stories as ‚ÄúChicken Painted on Folding Screen‚Äù (Byeongpunge geurin dagi), ‚ÄúGeumsun and the Chicken‚Äù (Geumsuni wa dak), and ‚ÄúThe Pack Horses Driver‚Äù (Mabu), but the characters in these texts find that they have no choice but to accede to this desire in order to maintain their livelihood. Rather vague in tone, these works differ from his earliest stories in that they lack historical awareness and portray common people merely as objects for contemplation. Nonetheless, they reveal increasing refinement of Kye Yongmuk‚Äôs artistic technique, a trend that continues in his post-Liberation works, including ‚ÄúCounting the Stars‚Äù (Byeoreul henda), ‚ÄúThe Wind Still Blows‚Äù (Barameun geunyang bulgo), and ‚ÄúWater Cicadas‚Äù (Mulmaemi).

It is found in Australia and in Southeast Asia. Taxonomy The Australasian bent-wing bat was described as a new species in 1922 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas. The holotype had been collected on 9 July 1922 by Oriana F. Wilson, widow of Antarctic explorer Edward Adrian Wilson. Thomas named the species Miniopterus orianae. This species was once considered a subspecies of common bent-wing bat. It is now accepted that the Australasian bent-winged bat and the Eastern bent-winged bat are two distinct species. The Australasian bent-wing bat has three subspecies: M. orianae bassanii (the southern bent-wing bat), M. o. orianae (the northern bent-wing bat), and M. o. oceanensis (the eastern bent-wing bat). Ecology It is known to harbor the blood parasite Polychromophilus melanipherus, though one study found that bats with the blood parasite did not appear to suffer deleterious effects such as anemia or low body weight. Range and habitat M. orianae bassanii only occurs in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia. M. orianae oceanensis occurs widely along the east coast of Australia. M. orianae orianae was first documented in Casurina Bay, which is from Darwin, Northern Territory. Conservation One of the subspecies (M. orianae bassanii) has been evaluated as critically endangered in Australia under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 since 2007. M. orianae oceanensis is listed as vulnerable in Victoria, as it is only known from one maternity cave.

Geology The cliff reveals sections from the uppermost part of the Maastrichtian stage (72 to 66 million years ago) and from the lowermost part of the Danian stage (66 to 62 million years ago). The dark layer of fiskeler, mainly five to ten centimeters thick, clearly marks the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary. The fiskeler is enriched in iridium, a fact used as an argument for the Alvarez hypothesis that the worldwide Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene mass extinction was caused by the impact of an asteroid.

It features a large exhibition of military equipment and a 1.5-hour guided tour in the large underground system of the fortress. The underground system of the fortress features of tunnels, living quarters and command centers, including a hospital and a chapel. There are also two ammunition depots for its two cannons.

Because he was extremely poor, Kwon never received a formal education, instead traveling Korea while working as a clerk, and sometimes resorting to betting to support himself.

However, while Kwon offers a fresh insight into the pain and sorrows of the common people caught in the turbulent period of Korea‚Äôs industrialization, he does not fail to discover a note of hope and power of resilience behind these dark lives. In his works, Kwon attempts to give an expression to the love he feels for all living things, for the people who retain a sense of hope even in hardship.?

History  The 13th SOC traces its descent to the 13th Infantry Regiment (13Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± Œ†ŒµŒ∂ŒπŒ∫Œøœç), formed in November‚ÄìDecember 1913 as part of the enlargement and re- organization of the Hellenic Army after the Balkan Wars. Along with the 27th and 28th Infantry Regiments, it formed the 11th Infantry Division under III Army Corps, headquartered in Thessaloniki. Along with the bulk of the Army, the regiment was disbanded during the National Schism in 1916. On 10 February 1920, the Regiment was ordered re-established, and by May it had been re- formed and joined the Xanthi Division in Western Thrace. In the second half of June 1920, the Regiment was placed at the disposal of the British command at √áanakkale, helping to secure the British occupation zone around the Dardanelles Strait. Between 1‚Äì10 July, it was shipped back to the area of Soufli. On 10 July, it crossed the Evros River as part of the Greek offensive against the Turkish army in Eastern Thrace, and advanced up to Kirk Kilisse. In April 1921, the regiment was transferred again to Asia Minor, participating in the operations of the remainder of the Asia Minor Campaign until 1922. In the re-organization of the Army following the defeat in Asia Minor, the 13th Regiment was once again placed under 11th Infantry Division, now based at Kilkis. In 1935, it was renamed to 65th Infantry Regiment. A 13th Infantry Regiment was re-formed in Thessaloniki upon the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940. Its formation was completed by mid-November, and, once again placed under 11th Infantry Division, it participated in the Greek offensive in Albania in the Ersek√´‚ÄìDobruzhe axis (21 November 1940 ‚Äì 5 February 1941). It was then placed in a defensive position at Mali Spadarit (6 February ‚Äì 2 April), where it was among the units that successfully faced the Italian Spring Offensive. After that, it was withdrawn to the rear, and, with the German invasion of Greece unfolding from 6 April, was gradually moved south back into Greece, reaching Metsovo on 17 April. Following the capitulation of the Army to the Germans on 23 April, the regiment was disarmed on 24 April and began to demobilize. The remnants were moved to Larissa on 4 May, and the unit was formally disbanded on 10 May. During the Axis occupation of Greece, the Panhellenic Liberation Organization, a Resistance group active in Macedonia, formed a \\"13th Guerrilla Regiment\\" (13Œø ŒëŒΩœÑŒ¨œÅœÑŒπŒ∫Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±) near Kilkis, based on the unit's traditional association with the area.

In 2002, the 13th Signals Company and the 13th Engineering Company were added as specialized support units. The unit forms part of the 1st Infantry Division, which groups together the Army's special and rapid reaction forces.

In 1947 the Cunningtons' extensive costume collection was acquired by the Manchester City Art Gallery and the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall was opened.

War and marriage During World War I Cunnington served as a Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In 1918 he married Phillis Webb who was also a qualified doctor and for a number of years they had a joint practice in Finchley. Costume and fashion Cunnington and his wife collected clothes, and they soon had to build a large shed in the garden to house them all. By the end of the 1930s, they had about a thousand costumes, some of which they loaned out for some of the first British television transmissions. Using his collection as a source, Cunnington published his first work, English Women's Clothing in the Nineteenth Century, in 1937. Although his second major work English Women's Clothing in the Present Century did not follow for 15 years he wrote a number of smaller works on the social implications and psychology of fashion. In collaboration with his wife he produced, A History of Underclothes, one of only a few studies on the subject at that time. When they retired, they sold the collection to the Manchester Art Gallery for display at the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall. Having moved to West Mersea, Essex the couple began a series of five handbooks that covered the history of English dress which they completed by 1959. Cunnington died at his home at West Mersea on 21 January 1961 aged 82. Museum of Clothes In a letter to The Times in November 1937 Cunnington suggested a national costume museum.C.

Part of their traditional land, once an Aboriginal reserve called Inglebah, is now a heritage Aboriginal Place. Territory The territory of the Himberrong clan stretches from the Moonbi Range in the west (adjoining Gamilaraay), past Yarrowitch and Kunderang in the east (adjoining Dunghutti), and from Nowendoc in the south (adjoining Biripi) to north of Walcha (adjoining Inuwon). Border disputes over the Moonbi Range were common between the Himberrong and a clan of the Gamilaraay. The main camp of the Himberrong was on the bank of the Muluerindie/Macdonald River about two miles upriver from where the area of Inglebah now stands. Inglebah was declared an Aboriginal reserve by the NSW Aborigines Protection Board in 1893, and is now preserved as a heritage Aboriginal Place. Inglebah is the Anaiwan word for whirlpools of crayfish; the swamps and gullies throughout the Inglebah district are perforated with thousands of crayfish holes. Inglebah was home to 50 or families until the 1940s, when most of them moved away. The land was handed over to the Aboriginal Land Trust in 1975, and later to the Amaroo Local Aboriginal Land Council. Aboriginal community gatherings are often held at Inglebah. \\"Traditionally Aboriginal people camped around Inglebah for fishing and ceremonial activities. Inglebah was favored because it was a sheltered, secure camping spot nestled between hills and the banks of the MacDonald River. It has a permanent water supply from the springs in the area, and various animals could be hunted there.\\" Inglebah Aboriginal Reserve holds special cultural and historical significance for the Himberrong Clan. Language The Himberrong clan spoke a dialect of the Anaiwan language. An elicitation of Anaiwan words was recorded on tape by Harry Wright in 1963 \\"as they were spoken by tribesmen coming into Armidale from Inglebah\\". History At the time of first contact, the Himberrong clan numbered around 600. Two Himberrong men by the names of Bungaree and Yarry were the first of their clan to encounter colonists in the early 1800s. Each year when winter was approaching, the clan would leave their camp at Inglebah, always heading east in the direction of the Macleay River (Dunghutti territory), but they would not push too far over the Great Dividing Range. On returning from their winter trips, the clan would have a great corroboree. = Inglebah Massacre = In the late 1800s, colonists used explosives to massacre the Himberrong clan at their main camp. The death toll is unknown. \\"There were pieces of burning wood of all sizes hurled hundreds of feet into the air...the shrieks of natives could be heard as they fled in all directions...what became of them for the next six months was never known...they disappeared completely from their usual hunting grounds...\\" Notes =Citations= Sources    Category:Aboriginal peoples of New South Wales ","title":"Himberrong"},{"id":"43123699","text":"Tarsozeuzera vavizola is a moth in the family Cossidae.

MAC unit. TrueAudio is the name given to AMD's ASIC intended to serve as dedicated co-processor for the calculations of computationally expensive advanced audio signal processing, like e.g. convolution reverberation effects and 3D audio effects. TrueAudio is integrated into some of the AMD GPUs and APUs available since 2013.  Overview  TrueAudio is a DSP for audio based on Cadence Tensilica HiFi EP DSP with Tensilica Xtensa SP float support. AMD claimed that a few simple audio effects can use up to 14% of the CPU. Audiokinetic claimed that it is up to 10%. Independent software vendors (ISV), such as game developers, can use what is called a Wwise audio plugin to offload such computations to the TrueAudio DSPs. The on-die TrueAudio DSPs provide a better \\"silicon area to computing power\\" ratio and \\"power consumption to computing power\\" ratio for audio processing than the CPU, effectively making it an audio acceleration unit. Any additional benefits of the TrueAudio DSPs, such as \\"better effects\\", have been severely criticized. In , AnandTech evaluated AMD TrueAudio using the Thief video game. = True Audio Next = A new version of TrueAudio, TrueAudio Next, was released with the AMD Radeon 400 series GPUs. TrueAudio Next utilizes the GPU to simulate audio physics. The move from a dedicated DSP to GPGPU breaks compatibility with the previous TrueAudio implementation. The TrueAudio Next SDK was released as open source through AMD's GPUOpen suite in August 2016. It also clarified that TrueAudio Next uses the GPU's ray-casting technology to do the audio computation, and can also reserve GCN compute units for lower latency. Support for True Audio Next was added to the beta Steam Application programming interface in February 2018.  Software support  Interfaces involved when offloading computations to AMD TrueAudio. Sound cards, AC'97/HDA-codec chips or audio over HDMI/DisplayPort are not affected. Neither are A3D, EAX or OpenAL. Support for the AMD TrueAudio ASIC is contained in the Linux kernel device driver amdgpu. AMD TrueAudio enables dedicated digital signal processing (DSP). Such dedicated audio processing horsepower is specifically for generating immersive soundscapes and saves CPU cycles that can be used for other game processing tasks such as AI and Physics. The video games Murdered: Soul Suspect, Star Citizen, Thief and Lichdom: Battlemage (uses CryEngine) can be configured to use AMD TrueAudio if present. There is an audio plug-in for Audiokinetic's Wwise (Wave Works Interactive Sound Engine) to off-load computation to the TrueAudio DSP(s). Wwise is available for Linux, OS X, Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One et al. GenAudio's AstoundSound, a highly optimized collection of advanced DSP C/C++ software available as a library or a plugin for augmenting real-time audio engines on Linux, OS X, Windows as well as Android and iOS, can make use of AMD TrueAudio. AstoundSound is also wrapped for several plug-in formats, such as RTAS and Wwise and has been integrated into several DSP chips. AstoundSound is described as fully programmable audio engine. As of July 2014 there are no news regarding products supporting TrueAudio and LV2. * ‚Äì special version of \\"Tuscany\\" VR demo from Oculus VR; AMD TrueAudio is utilized to calculate the spatialization of an audio environment. Spatialization is a technique that permits the audio engine to create a fully 3D soundfield on a stereo headset. This effect is powered by the positional 3D audio plugin \\"AstoundSound 3D RTI\\" (real-time interface) by GenAudio, and it includes support for elevation, distance and positioning. AstoundSound is e.g. integrated with the FMOD Studio.  Driver support  AMD has retired AMD TrueAudio Technology support with Radeon Software Crimson Edition 16.40 and introduced a new way for developers to support AMD TrueAudio Technology like features with AMD TrueAudio Next. More information on TrueAudio Next can be found at http://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/true-audio-next/.  Availability  AMD TrueAudio is found on-die of select AMD graphics cards and APUs. A die can house multiple AMD TrueAudio DSP cores, each having 32KiB instruction and data caches and 8KiB of scratchpad memory for local operation. AMD TrueAudio SIP blocks are found on the dies of some GPUs of the AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series; namely the Radeon R7 260, Radeon R7 260X, Radeon R9 285, Radeon R9 290, Radeon R9 290X and the Radeon R9 295X2, and in Kaveri and Carrizo-based APUs.

The data are arranged radially around a circle with the relationships between the data points typically drawn as arcs connecting the data. The format can be aesthetically pleasing, making it a popular choice in the world of data visualization. The primary use of chord diagrams is to show the flows or connections between several entities (called nodes). Each entity is represented by a fragment (often colored or pattered) along the circumference of the circle. Arcs are drawn between entities to show flows (and exchanges in economics). The thickness of the arc is proportional to the significance of the flow.  Name  Chord diagrams get their name from terminology used in geometry. A chord of a circle is a geometric line segment whose endpoints both lie on the circle. Chord diagrams are also known as radial network diagrams and may sometimes be referred to as a type of circular layout.  Hierarchical edge bundling  While a small amount of data could be represented in a circular diagram using straight lines to show the interconnections, a diagram featuring numerous lines would quickly become illegible. To reduce the visual complexity, chord diagrams employ a technique called hierarchical edge bundling.  Common Usages  Chord diagrams are useful for showing relationships between entities and their relative magnitudes in comparison to alternative arcs. As a result, chord diagrams are popular in migration studies, economic flows, and genome studies. They have also been used to highlight unexplored relationships to help address the problem of filter bubbles, where further work by one of the authors, Shahin Rostami, led to the Open source Chord package for visualising these relationships interactively.

It operated as a venue for variety shows, pantomimes, musical comedies and other shows from 1913 to 1961. When Peter Sellers appeared there in 1948 he complained that the band accompanying his drum act were four bars behind as they were eating their sandwiches while they were playing. Early years Located on the corner of Station Road and Birchett Road in Aldershot, and replacing a group of derelict buildings which dated to the late 1850s, the Hippodrome was built for Clarence Sounes and was designed by the leading English theatre architect Bertie Crewe. It was a sister theatre to the Kingston Empire at Kingston upon Thames, which had opened in 1910. The Hippodrome opened on 3 February 1913 with variety shows twice a night at 6.30 and 8.50 pm. The bill on opening night included Chas Karnac & Co, The Four Debutants, Sisters Jerome, Tom Westwall, Duncan & Godfrey, Chas Kitts and Rhoda Windrum. Theatre and cinema The interior of the Hippodrome in 1913 The theatre was the largest for miles around with seating for about 1,000 people, which included 449 seats in the stalls, 258 seats in the dress circle, 272 seats in the balcony (originally this was benched) in addition to four boxes which seated four people in each. The proscenium was 24 feet wide, and the stage was 30 feet high and 22 feet in depth. The theatre was equipped with bars on all levels and eight dressing rooms. By March 1914, the Hippodrome was showing Kinemacolour films alongside the variety acts and, by the end of the 1920s, cinema shows were occasionally also being shown there. The Hippodrome was taken over by Kingshot Theatres in 1930 who refurbished it in 1931 with a \\"Grand Re-Opening\\" on 6 April 1931, when it began to show twice nightly cine- variety including the screening of \\"Path√© Super Sound Gazette\\", part of Path√© News.The Hippodrome on the Cinema Treasures website By 1953, in addition to the twice-nightly variety shows the Hippodrome also staged pantomimes, circus acts, plays and musical comedies.The Hippodrome Theatre on 'The Music Hall and Theatre History Website Notable performers Poster advertising Phyllis Dixey's act- the Hippodrome, Aldershot (1955) The Hippodrome played host to many famous artists of the day, including: Marie Lloyd, Neville Kennard, The Western Brothers, Tom Leamore,Tom Leamore on The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America website Humphrey Lyttelton, Acker Bilk, Mike & Bernie Winters, Eric Delaney, Chas McDevitt and Nancy Whiskey, Arthur English, Clapham and Dwyer, Sabrina, Phyllis Dixey,Bond, Derek.

Decline and demolition The Hippodrome being demolished in 1961 With ever-increasing numbers of people going to the cinema or watching television as an alternative to going to the theatre, audiences began to dwindle in the 1950s when the theatre shifted more towards nude revue. This proved rather lucrative as the nearly all-male audience preferred to sit in the more expensive seats near the stage. Partly refurbished in 1953, the Hippodrome reopened fitfully under a number of managers until about 1960 and was demolished in 1961 after an unsuccessful campaign to save it. The last show performed there was a repertory production of Dry Rot. The 1960s office block Hippodrome House occupies the site today.

Moscovici (also known as Tovilie;Stahl, p.20 November 28, 1885 ‚Äì November 1, 1943) was a Romanian socialist militant and journalist, one of the noted leaders of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR). A socialist since early youth and a party member since its creation in 1910, he returned from captivity in World War I to lead the PSDR from Bucharest, and involved himself in a violent clash with the Romanian authorities. He mediated between reformist and Bolshevik currents, and helped establish the Socialist Party of Romania (PS) as a fusion of both tendencies. Moscovici served as a PS representative in Chamber, but was deposed over his instigation of the 1920 general strike, then imprisoned. Although he voted against the creation of a Communist Party from the rump PS and criticized Comintern interference in Romanian affairs, he was again apprehended in 1921. Together with the communists, he appeared as a defendant in the Dealul Spirii Trial. Moscovici spent the 1920s and '30s on reconstructing the PSDR and enlarging its basis, sometimes together with, and sometimes against, the moderate socialist Constantin Titel Petrescu. He was the party's representative to the Labor and Socialist International, a participant in antifascist causes, and a publisher of Marxist literature. Seen as the Social Democratic doctrinaire, he continued to take stands against the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, cautioning against the formation of a \\"popular front\\". Persecuted by the far-right for his politics and his Jewish ethnicity, Moscovici was still active in the clandestine PSDR by the time of World War II. He died, after a long illness, before his party's involvement in the Coup of 1944. In later years, after the PSDR was absorbed by the Communist Party, Moscovici's contribution was censored out of socialist history. His work was carried on by his daughter, Mira Moscovici, who helped reestablish an independent PSDR in 1990, during the country's post-communist era. Moscovici's relatives include French social scientist Serge Moscovici and his son, the politician Pierre Moscovici. Biography =Early life and World War I= Moscovici was born on November 28, 1885, in BƒÉiceni village, Ia»ôi CountyIancu Braun»ôtein, Evreii √Æn prima universitate din Rom√¢nia, II.

(just outside Pa»ôcani, where he always owned a townhouse).Filitti II, p.10 He is known to have completed his secondary studies at the National College in Ia»ôi, and to have enlisted at the local university faculty of medicine in 1906. He was already active in Marxist milieu, scattered after the earlier split of the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party. Young Moscovici joined up with Leon Ghelerter's \\"Social Studies Circle\\", where he became comrades with Mihail Gheorghiu Bujor, Ottoi CƒÉlin, Max Wexler, and Emil Socor.Petrescu, p.162, 219, 247 He was a frequent contributor to the socialist press, in magazines such as Rom√¢nia Muncitoare or Lupta, and translated under the pen name I. Nour.Mihail Straje, Dic»õionar de pseudonime, anonime, anagrame, astronime, criptonime ale scriitorilor »ôi publici»ôtilor rom√¢ni, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1973. p.460, 495. In 1910, Moscovici and the entire Social Studies Circle became members of the Social Democratic Party (PSDR), founded as Romania's new socialist party. At the second party congress, in June 1912, Moscovici and Constantin Popovici were rapporteurs on workers' compensation issues.Petrescu, p.248 The following year, with Romania's entry into the Second Balkan War, Moscovici was drafted as a medic into the Romanian Land Forces, and sent to the Bulgarian front; he witnessed first-hand the failures of sanitation and healthcare in the army, as some 5,600 soldiers died of cholera and other treatable causes.Petrescu, p.256 Upon his return to Bucharest, Moscovici reported to his party about the matter, and organized a public protest against Conservative Party rule. Joining him in this effort were other veterans of the Bulgarian campaign, including his lifelong friends Constantin Titel Petrescu and Toma Dragu, alongside the socialist physician Ecaterina Arbore. The authorities moved to organize a court-martial, but withdrew the request when faced with public outcry.Petrescu, p.257 In August 1913, Moscovici was in Dobreni commune, Neam»õ County, addressing the local peasants and trying to get them interested in the PSDR agenda.Ioan Scurtu, \\"Contribu»õii privind mi»ôcarea »õƒÉrƒÉneascƒÉ din Rom√¢nia √Æn perioada 1907-1914\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 3/1968, p.519 In 1916, at the height of World War I, Romania declared war on the Central Powers; she lost the subsequent battle, and the legitimate government was forced to withdraw to Ia»ôi, presiding over a rump Romanian state. Again mobilized as a reserve officer, Constantin C. Gombo»ô, \\"√énsemnƒÉri din prizonieratul german\\", in Historia, May 2006 Moscovici was captured by the German Army, interned, and transported to Germany as a prisoner of war. In May 1917, he was at the POW camp in Krefeld, sharing captivity with the likes of Alexandru D. Sturdza and Mircea Florian. Set free by the time of Romania's peace with the Central Powers, Moscovici returned to Bucharest, which was still occupied by German troops. For a while, he turned to regular journalism, and, with A. de Herz, Liviu Rebreanu, Scarlat Froda and Barbu LƒÉzƒÉreanu, put out a theatrical daily, Scena. He left after a few months and was replaced with A»ôer Penijel.I. Peltz, Amintiri din via»õa literarƒÉ, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 1974, p.22. Most of his fellow prisoners were also repatriated on May 19, 1918. During the interval, Moscovici also resumed his contacts with the PSDR, which was hostile to the German occupiers and undecided about the government in Ia»ôi. Moscovici resumed his militancy, cooperating with Gheorghe Cristescu and other Bucharest socialists. As the PSDR general secretary»òerbulescu, p.25 (later co-chair of the Executive Committee),Liveanu, p.100 he was one of the main figures in attendance at the social-democratic club on Sf√¢ntul IonicƒÉ Street, Bucharest. Alongside its core of PSDR activists, the club was frequented by self-styled \\"Bolsheviks\\", including David FabianTismƒÉneanu, p.85 and the teenaged Belu Zilber. The latter recalls that Moscovici, who did not share his radicalism, was \\"a figure of rare magnanimity, with an ancestral Judaic passion for ideas.\\" =Socialist Party and 1918 trial= The party openly rejected the peace with Germany, but did so by invoking Wilsonian principles, including the slogan of \\"peace with no annexations\\".Petrescu, p.291-293 The German crackdown brought ended with the arrest of Moscovici and his colleagues, and their detainment at VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti.Petrescu, p.292 After the November Armistice (Germany's unexpected defeat), the PSDR gained importance in the disorganized territory, from which the Germans were hastily withdrawing. In 1922, Moscovici himself wrote that the party missed out on an opportunity for revolution, because it \\"refused\\" to do so. Although the workers' guard outnumbered the Gendarmerie, the PSDR agreed to allow censorship of its press, and did not participate in the oil industry strikes of November 30.Liveanu, p.100-102 On December 11, the PSDR transformed itself into the Socialist Party of Romania. Its program, written down by »òerban Voinea in 1919, specified that the members stood for \\"scientific socialism\\" and the socialization of property, but also for reformism (in the absence of a revolutionary class).Petrescu, p.321-327 The PS was immediately approached for secretive talks by radicalized members of the establishment, grouped in the People's Party (PP). The central issue was the PS' nominal support for republicanism, which was also espoused by some of the PP doctrinaires‚Äîthough not by the party leader, General Alexandru Averescu. In exchange for support, Averescu was ready to co-opt the PS into a future government.Petrescu, p.314 Moscovici was among the PS representatives who discussed the matter with PP emissaries Constantin Argetoianu and P. P. Negulescu. In the end, the socialists were adamant in their rejection of a compromise.Petrescu, p.314-315 Although favoring non-engagement, Moscovici and Cristescu approved of the typesetters' call to a general strike on December 25, after it became apparent that the outcome was inevitable. For his part, Moscovici was in contact with centrist newspaper proprietors such as Grigore Filipescu, who wanted to organize their own solidarity strike against censorship.Liveanu, p.102; Petrescu, p.318 Even though they did not take part in organizing the actual workers' strike, the PS men were immediately identified as culprits by the authorities, who amassed a Chasseurs' Regiment around the Sf√¢ntul IonicƒÉ building.Liveanu, p.102-103; Petrescu, p.316-320 It was at that moment, on December 26, that Moscovici and other moderates took the initiative, and sent couriers at factories throughout the city, calling union men to leave their stations and rally on the army-occupied street.Liveanu, p.103-104; Petrescu, p.318 In hindsight, Moscovici referred to this as a hasty action, leading into a trap set by the authorities.Liveanu, p.104; Petrescu, p.318-319 In later communist historiography, he was condemned for \\"not posing [himself] the problem of organizing the workers' revolutionary fight, [...] so as the masses would avoid bloody attacks by the authorities, or respond to such attacks with due force.\\"Liveanu, p.106 Some tens of workers were killed when the Chasseurs' Regiment fired on the columns gathering at Teatrului Square, on Calea Victoriei; up to 500 people, including labor organizer I. C. Frimu, were arrested.Liveanu, p.104-106; Petrescu, p.318-321, 336-338\\\\. See also Vasile Th.

A large segment of PS activists (48 men), was court-martialled on various charges: with Cristescu, Popovici, Voinea and Alecu Constantinescu, Moscovici was indicted of sedition and \\"bringing offense\\" to King Ferdinand I.Petrescu, p.320-321 A celebrity defense team, comprising Petrescu, Constantin Mille, Constantin Costa-Foru, N. D. Cocea, Constantin Angelescu, Radu D. Rosetti, and D. R. Ioani»õescu, managed to obtain acquittals for most of the defendants.Petrescu, p.321 The party continued to threaten with strike actions during the closing months of 1919, and, although it won seats in the November election, boycotted Parliament.Petrescu, p.329-336 In parallel, the PS committees negotiated an understanding with socialist Romanians from those former regions of Austria- Hungary which had been incorporated into Greater Romania. In October 1920, the PS absorbed the Bukovina Social Democratic Party and the Transylvania Social Democratic Party. The reorganized party, an uneasy alliance of reformists and Bolshevized radicals, held sway over the 156 trade unions in Greater Romania, having blocked out competition from syndicalism and anarchism.Ghiulea, p.44-45 It counted 148,500 as its total members.Petrescu, p.327 =1920 strike= Moscovici, who represented the PS Executive Committee at the funeral ceremony of Marxist theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea,Petrescu, p.339 ran in the May 1920 suffrage, carried out under a PP government. He was elected to the Assembly (Chamber) of Deputies, alongside Cristescu. Fellow deputy Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, of the right-wing National Romanian Party, recalled hearing them speak: Cristescu, he noted, was an \\"uncultured Romanian\\", whereas Moscovici was a \\"cultured Jew\\".Filipescu, p.68 According to the American visitor Charles Upson Clark, Moscovici was a remarkable figure, \\"the most prominent Jewish member of the House\\".Clark, p.451 The party involved itself in the radical opposition to the Averescu government, calling the administration a \\"terror regime\\" denying workers \\"their most basic citizens' rights\\".Iaco»ô, p.1074 The PS and many others on the left were infuriated by Minister Grigore Trancu- Ia»ôi's law on labor courts, which seemed like an effort to reduce unions' representative power.Iaco»ô, p.1075, 1078, 1081-1082; Petrescu, p.351-353, 357 On October 10, 1920, Moscovici was one of the participants to the congress of the General Council of the Socialist Party and Labor Unions. In its ultimatum to the government, it asked for the recognition of collective bargaining, and demanded a unified and advanced system of workers' compensation, threatening with a general strike in case of non-compliance.Iaco»ô, p.1074-1076; Petrescu, p.351-355 With Iosif Jumanca and Rudolf Gaidosch, Moscovici was part of a PS commission of handpicked moderates who presented Averescu with the PS' demands.Iaco»ô, p.1074-1075; Petrescu, p.354 When Averescu refused to give in, the PS put into motion the October 20 general strike, with the peaceful slogan: \\"Everyone stays at home, we will hold no demonstrations so as not to leave room for the provocateurs.\\"Iaco»ô, p.1082 Beyond this facade, the PS was torn by factionalism. The radical section made open calls for the party's transformation. In the theoretical organ Lupta de ClasƒÉ, there was already talk of forming \\"the vanguard party of the proletariat, the communist party\\". Yet, as Moscovici explained in a 1922 essay, Problemele actuale ale mi»ôcƒÉrii socialiste (\\"Current Issues Facing the Socialist Movement\\"), \\"although ours is a revolutionary party, who realizes that Capitalist Society cannot be overturned in any other way but through a revolution‚Äîonce our Society, like our proletariat, is ripened enough for it [Moscovici's italics]‚Äî, it would be an enormous mistake to maintain that the general strike has aimed to overthrow the current State's regime.\\"Topliceanu, p.141-142 The socialists' attempt to \\"pressure\\" the government into reforming the labor legislation \\"failed, and we did not wish for a revolution.\\"Topliceanu, p.142 The immediate effects of the strike were an economic crisis and a settlement between the right-wing National Liberal Party, in the opposition, and the PP government.Iaco»ô, p.1085-1086 As the academic and labor organizer Nicolae Ghiulea attests: \\"General Averescu's government reacted by ordering the sentencing of socialist leaders, the arrest of all workers who had any sort of influence over their comrades, the dissolution of all trade unions, the suspension of the socialist and workers' press, the closure and destruction of press quarters. Scattered, lacking a class consciousness and with no means of resistance, the working masses abandoned the movement.\\"Ghiulea, p.45 In May 1921, Averescu also passed a more liberal law on labor disputes, which allowed trade unions to form but screened their leadership for various criteria, including Romanian ethnicity.Ghiulea, p.45-47 Moscovici, stripped of his seat in the Chamber, was made subject to a court-martial. Its proceedings were a publicized affair: Averescu himself was called to the stand, where he reluctantly acknowledged having called upon the PS during his time in the opposition. X.

Le proc√®s des socialistes roumains\\", in L'Humanit√©, December 21, 1920, p.3 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) The revelation of Averescu's \\"plot against the Crown\\" left a mark on public opinion. Writing at the time, sociologist Dimitrie DrƒÉghicescu argued that \\"somebody with enough courage and authority should take the plotter by the collar and throw him into that place where he himself has thrown Ilie Moscovici.\\"DrƒÉghicescu, p.64 In the end, Moscovici, Socor, and three other defendants were sentenced to five years of penal labor. Upon hearing the verdict, Moscovici was heard shouting: \\"Socialism shall not die! Long live socialism!\\"Pas, p.28 =Communist schism= The recipient of an amnesty, Moscovici returned to the PS just as the radical side, inspired by the consolidation of Soviet Russia, was pushing for the party's affiliation to the Comintern. In essence, Moscovici, Petrescu and other centrists did not reject outright the notion of affiliating, but demanded guarantees‚Äîwhereas the \\"rightist\\" side of the PS, with Jumanca, Voinea, and Iacob Pistiner, simply objected to all manner of contact with the Soviets.Filipescu, p.70 They were joined by Ioan Fluera»ô, leader of the Transylvanian socialists, who had visited Russia, experienced communism directly without being won over, and denounced the Comintern's agenda;Neagoe, p.111; Petrescu, p.358 the Comintern deposed him from the delegation, citing Fluera»ô's presence on the Transylvanian Council that voted union with Romania.TismƒÉneanu, p.69 The pro- Comintern left, however, included Moscovici's old associate and Chamber colleague, Cristescu. As Moscovici himself noted, the latter returned from Russia with orders to expel the \\"opportunistic\\" members on the right.FrunzƒÉ, p. 269-270 According to a retrospective article published by Lumea NouƒÉ newspaper in 1922, the old socialists were only reserved one seat on the Executive Committee, to be contested between Cristescu, Popovici and Moscovici.FrunzƒÉ, p.23, 31 Nevertheless, later historians argue that the list of the Central Committee imposed by the Comintern comprised not only all three, but also trade unionists and other centrist socialists.Nicolae Jurca, L'histoire de la social-d√©mocratie de Roumanie, FF Press, Bucharest, 2000, p. 152. ; M. C. StƒÉnescu, Gheorghe Neac»ôu, Moscova, Cominternul, filiera comunistƒÉ balcanicƒÉ »ôi Rom√¢nia, 1919-1943, SILEX, Bucharest, 1994, p. 19. As Moscovici later stated, Comintern affiliation \\"means true disaster for the workers; it has always been the greatest obstacle to achieving or preparing the socialist revolution.\\"Topliceanu, p.143 The mass of proletarians, he suggested, was unprepared for a major political role, which could only be arrived at through gradualism (\\"the strengthening of the working masses in body and spirit\\").Topliceanu, p.144 According to Bolshevik delegate Mihail Cruceanu, Moscovici was making efforts to boycott a PS vote on the issue, refusing to convene a congress and leaving intact the seal placed by Averescu's police on the Sf√¢ntul IonicƒÉ building.Cruceanu, p.178-179 On the right, George Grigorovici also reacted to Cristescu's Bolshevism by reestablishing the Bukovina Social Democratic Party. Accused by the communists of playing into the hands of the political establishment, S., \\"Nouvelles internationales. Le Congr√®s du Parti roumain\\", in L'Humanit√©, November 7, 1922, p.2 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) this group competed with the PS for a few months, claiming to embody the PDSR's moderate core.Petrescu, p.358 Together with the other formerly Austro-Hungarian chapters of the PS, Grigorovici set up his own Provisional Central Committee, later Federation of Socialist Parties from Romania (FPSR).Neagoe, p.111; Petrescu, p.305 Such moves led the radical faction in effective control of the PS. On May 8, 1921, this group, with Cristescu at the helm, voted to set up the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR, or \\"Socialist- Communists\\"), a Comintern affiliate. As Ghiulea noted, the vote signified a \\"communist takeover of the socialist party\\", leaving socialism divided into \\"three pathways\\". The PCdR was that of \\"violent agitation.\\" As argued by Clark, the Socialist Party survived an attempted seizure \\"by Communistic elements\\".Clark, p.433 This was also the version supported by Moscovici's rump PS. In February 1922, it defined the PCdR as a \\"brand new party\\", adding: \\"we are the continuation of the old party with its program, that no one and nothing has been able to change.\\"FrunzƒÉ, p.31 The government moved to immediately arrest and prosecute those delegates present at Sf√¢ntul IonicƒÉ during the vote. Moscovici was picked up as well, and, although he had voted against Comintern membership, was indicted in the subsequent Dealul Spirii Trial. The prosecutor aimed to show that he and Cristescu had conspired \\"to overthrow the current form of government\\". Paula Mihailov, \\"AutoritƒÉ»õile pierd procesul\\" , in Jurnalul Na»õional, October 13, 2004 Kept separate from his former colleagues,Cruceanu, p.189 Moscovici was among those acquitted, alongside Cruceanu, Popovici, and Elek K√∂bl√∂s (most of the others were eventually amnestied by the king).\\"Informa»õiuni\\", in Biserica »ôi »òcoala, Nr. 7/1922, p.5 Moscovici's rump PS ultimately joined up with Jumanca and Fluera»ô's FPSR by August 1922.Petrescu, p.305. See also Neagoe p.112 According to the communist press of the day, this group, also known as Unified Party, only managed to keep as its members \\"some tens of renegades\\"; however, the FPSR claimed that the PCdR only managed to sign up some 500 of the total 40,000 PS members, the rest having defected after the Comintern affiliation.FrunzƒÉ, p.30 At the same time, according to the reports presented at its 1922 congress, the FPSR claimed 12,000 members, of which 6,000 in Banat, 2,000 in Transylvania and 2,000 in Bukovina.Nicolae Jurca, Istoria social-democra»õiei din Rom√¢nia, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ, Bucharest, 1994, p. 141 Moscovici, as ideologue of the Federation, noted that the coming \\"Social Revolution\\" would not be inspired by Russia, but could only be \\"handed down to us by the proletarian class in advanced countries\\". The Federation signaled its opposition to the Comintern by rallying with the International Working Union of Socialist Parties (the \\"2¬Ω International\\"), and later to the Labor and Socialist International (LSI). Moscovici was the party representative to the ISWU Congress in Hamburg.Petrescu, p.365 Back in Romania, he was one of the socialists who also joined the League of Human Rights, alongside left- leaning politicians such as Costa-Foru, Nicolae Lupu, Vasile Stroiescu and Dem I. Dobrescu.Petrescu, p.382-386 =PSDR survival= Moscovici (back row, in dark suit), listening in as Paul L√∂be speaks in front of the Socialist Inter- Parliamentary Conference of 1931. The photograph also shows Constantin Titel Petrescu (seated directly in front of Moscovici), Lothar RƒÉdƒÉceanu, Yanko Sakazov, and various representatives of the Belgian and Czechoslovak socialist parties After the 1922 election, Pistiner was the only FPSR deputy in Chamber, allowing the center-left Peasants' Party to represent the main channel for workers' grievances.Filipescu, p.70-71 However, according to DrƒÉghicescu, the FPSR was destined to slowly erode the Peasantist vote, with the consolidation of the proletarian class.DrƒÉghicescu, p.106-110 Moscovici, Grigorovici, alongside Ghelerter and Dragu, were \\"realistic\\" leaders, who could potentially transform the FPSR from a sectarian \\"class party\\" into a \\"party of ideas\\".DrƒÉghicescu, p.107 At the time, the party's theorist was Voinea, who, as an Austromarxist, steered the FPSR away from social-liberal deviations.Stahl, p.18-20 For his part, Moscovici represented the FPSR and spoke about its policies at Dimitrie Gusti's Social Institute‚Äîone of a set of conferences in which Romanian doctrinaires advertised their respective ideologies.Vasile Netea, Memorii, Editura Nico, T√¢rgu Mure»ô, 2010, p.182. In March 1924, Moscovici, Fluera»ô and Pistiner were the Romanian representatives to the Balkan Socialist Conference of Bucharest. They received prominent figures of the LSI, including Irakli Tsereteli, Friedrich Adler, ≈Ωivko Topaloviƒá, Yanko Sakazov, and Asen Tsankov.Joseph Rothschild, The Communist Party of Bulgaria: Origins and Development, 1883-1936, Columbia University Press, New York City, 1959, p.271. Nevertheless, the Federation continued to discuss secretly with the PCdR, even after the latter had been outlawed; communist militants identified Moscovici as one of the main opponents of a tactical \\"united front\\".Rusenescu, p.993 In Lumea NouƒÉ, Moscovici denounced the Comintern's directives on the matter. The communists, Moscovici wrote, \\"have to come up once in a while with a proposal to create the united front, without ever bringing it about, so as to maneuver against other workers' parties and compromise the leaders of said parties.\\"FrunzƒÉ, p.268. See also Rusenescu, p.996 Moscovici looked into the Soviet Union's acts of provocation, and, in the official newspaper Socialismul, denounced the Tatarbunary Uprising as a Cominternist invasion.FrunzƒÉ, p.70-71, 555 In his view, the Soviet-backed \\"Moldavian Republic\\" was \\"non-existent and ridiculous\\".FrunzƒÉ, p.71 On May 9, 1927, following a Federation congress, the old PSDR was reborn, with a more centralized structure.Neagoe, p.112; Petrescu, p.399-400; TismƒÉneanu, p.79 Moscovici, Petrescu, Pistiner, Jumanca and Fluera»ô, as well as the younger Lothar RƒÉdƒÉceanu, were voted in as the Executive Bureau; Jumanca was the Secretary, Moscovici the Party Treasurer.Petrescu, p.400 He also took charge of the PSDR's publishing activity and cultural club. It was hosted by the printing offices of Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu, on Calea Victoriei, where Moscovici was the sales manager.Zolt√°n Rost√°s, Henri H. Stahl, \\"Interviu cu H.H. Stahl: 'Eu n-am fost fanatic niciodatƒÉ'\\" (fragment of Monografia ca utopie), at Cooperativa Gusti, May 6, 2014; retrieved June 22, 2014 He had regular meetings with left-wing figures such as the Peasantist leader Constantin Stere, the physician Simion Iagnov, and Voinea's half-brother, the sociologist Henri H. Stahl.Stahl, p.20, 61 As Stahl recalls: \\"the basis of my political conceptions, so to say, came from Moscovici, who was a very interesting man. He was a very well-read man. [...] he was a furious anti-Bolshevik.\\" The enterprise, however, went out of business after publishing a single title‚Äîa brochure about Giacomo Matteotti. Once consolidated, Romanian social democracy began cooperating with the National Peasants' Party (PN≈¢), which showed most promise in reforming the Romanian social system.Petrescu, p.400-404 In cartel with the PN≈¢, the PSDR made its return to Chamber following the election of 1928.Filipescu, p.71; Neagoe, p.112; Petrescu, p.404-405; TismƒÉneanu, p.83 The alliance ended abruptly when the PN≈¢ cabinet of Iuliu Maniu used violence to quell down the Lupeni Strike of 1929, while also refusing to release left-wing political prisoners.Petrescu, p.405-408, 434 The PSDR suffered another setback in 1928, when the Ghelerter faction defected, reclaiming for itself the title of Social-Democratic Workers' Party, later Unitary Socialist Party (PSU). It managed to attract into its ranks Moscovici, Popovici, and eventually Cristescu, who had been deposed as PCdR leader.Petrescu, p.408-410\\\\. See also TismƒÉneanu, p.83 Moscovici eventually returned to the PSDR, and attended, alongside Petrescu, the Socialist Inter-Parliamentary Conference of 1931.Petrescu, p.424-425 A year later, he was the party's delegate to the funeral of Iosif Ciser, a leader of the Jiu Valley miners. Marian Boboc, \\"Istorii insolite ale presei de pe Jiuri (VII). Am aflat cine au fost tovarƒÉ»ôii ortaci redactori-responsabili ai Minerului\\", in Ziarul VƒÉii Jiului, November 10, 2011 On September 15, 1929, Moscovici had become editor of a monthly, Mi»ôcarea SocialƒÉ (\\"The Social Movement\\"). With contributions from Voinea and RƒÉdƒÉceanu, and translations from Europe's leading Marxist theoreticians, it survived to 1933.Petrescu, p.397-398 Also in 1929, Moscovici and Socor sat on the board of a cooperative, Casa Poporului (\\"People's House\\"), which attempted to purchase land property and place it under proletarian administration.\\"Anun»õuri comerciale. Casa Poporului\\", in Monitorul Ofical, Nr. 187, Part II, August 24, 1929, p.1322-1323 =Antifascist campaigns= The PSDR's pacifist anti-fascism was channeled in the creation of several left-wing bodies, frequented by Moscovici and accepting communist members: the Unitary Front, the League against Terror, the League against War and Fascism.Constantinescu-Ia»ôi, p.321 The years after Ghelerter's departure brought clashes between the socialists and the antisemitic far-right, in particular the National-Christian Defense League (LANC). In 1926, a LANC politician, Nicolae Paulescu, proclaimed that \\"the kike Moscovici\\" managed an \\"almost entirely kikeified party.\\"Horia BozdoghinƒÉ, \\"Nicolae C. Paulescu ‚Äì teoretician al antisemitismului '»ôtiin»õific'\\", in the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu Studia Universitatis Cibiniensis. Series Historica, Vol. V, 2008, p.176 The League of Human Rights was dissolved that year, after Costa-Foru was beaten and mutilated by LANC youth.Petrescu, p.386 In early 1930, the international press reported that Moscovici and PSDR deputy RƒÉdƒÉceanu had been assaulted by far-right students and \\"badly abused\\". Moscovici was injured in the attack, and recovering at home. \\"Revue mondiale\\", in La Tribune Juive, Strasbourg, Nr. 18/1930, p.272 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) At the 1933 PSDR Congress, which condemned the success of fascism in Europe and labeled Nazi Germany a \\"barbarous regime\\", Moscovici was elected to the Executive Committee.Petrescu, p.429-430 During those years, the activities of a LANC successor, the Iron Guard, signaled a deep political crisis. After Premier Ion G. Duca's assassination by an Iron Guard death squad, the authorities decided to also clamp down on the PSDR press.Petrescu, p.431-433 Deep rifts were also showing between the orthodox Marxism of Petrescu and Moscovici and the more reformist stance of Transylvanian socialists.Petrescu, p.433-434 During 1936, citing the Comintern's revised \\"popular front\\" doctrine against fascism, the clandestine PCdR and its Red Aid connections negotiated a rapprochement with the PSDR. Moscovici's own political essays, taken up by Lumea NouƒÉ, treated the communists' proposal with suspicion.Constantinescu-Ia»ôi, p.321, 323 As Petrescu argues, PSDR leaders were persuaded when communists renounced their \\"provocative and libelous verbiage\\"; but they eventually found it impossible to deal with a party that did not accept \\"legality and democracy.\\"Petrescu, p.441-442 Instead, in 1937, the PSDR managed to reintegrate the Unitary Socialist Party, including Cristescu and his followers.Petrescu, p.409 During that time, Moscovici was reelected to the Executive Committee, and was again Party Treasurer.Petrescu, p.451 The general election of 1937 evidenced the PSDR's decline after its split with the PN»ö: it only received 0.9% of the national vote.TismƒÉneanu, p.83 The tied elections were decided by King Carol II, who blocked the Iron Guard threat by handing power to another fascist group: the National Christian Party (PNC, successor of the LANC) with Octavian Goga as Premier. In its bid for additional support, the PNC managed to obtain the collaboration of some right-wing PSDR leaders, most notably Fluera»ô.Petrescu, p.457 The following year, Carol II instituted his own dictatorship, centered on the quasi-fascist National Renaissance Front (FRN). To Moscovici's chagrin, the FRN was also able to enlist some of the right- leaning socialists, who justified themselves as supporters \\"of the king against the Iron Guard.\\"Petrescu, p.458 The most prominent defectors were Fluera»ô and Grigorovici, whose option made them bitter rivals of Petrescu (and, to a lesser degree, of Moscovici himself). Jumanca also left the party to support the FRN, but his relatively low profile allowed him to maintain more cordial contacts with the PSDR leaders.Neagoe, p.112 =Final years and death= Although all parties but the FRN had been banned by the authoritarian Constitution, the PSDR maintained an informal existence around Lumea NouƒÉ paper (where Moscovici was still a leading contributor).Petrescu, p.459. See also TismƒÉneanu, p.83 However, the party had to relinquish its seats in the LSI.Petrescu, p.460 The FRN regime, politically isolated by World War II, crumbled in 1940, unable to deal with Nazi and Soviet pressures (the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and the loss of Northern Transylvania). Romania experienced an episode of Iron Guard rule, with Ion Antonescu as the ConducƒÉtor. The clandestine PSDR objected to such moves, as well as to the subsequent German occupation, placing its hopes in the Western Allies.Petrescu, p.463, 465 After securing his position in a bloody confrontation with the Iron Guard, Antonescu involved Romania in the war against the Soviet Union. Antisemitic measures and the clampdown on dissident activities reached a peak. Ailing from heart disease and noticeably poor, Moscovici was threatened with imminent eviction from his Bucharest home in Vatra LuminoasƒÉ, and had to move in with friends.Filitti I, passim. See also Pas, p.28 As noted by his daughter Mira, the signal for this persecution was an article in the fascist newspaper Porunca Vremii.Filitti I, p.10 Against the family's protests, the house was listed for rent by the Romanianization bureau, which had barred Jews from placing bids. When Moscovici presented his certificate of service in World War I, guaranteeing him special treatment, the officials objected that he was not a war invalid.Filitti I, p.10-11, 12 Moscovici was also prevented from cashing into his Journalists' Union pension, owing to his racial origins. He was advised to seek an interview with Antonescu, but he rejected the idea outright.Filitti I, p.10-11 Although exposed to such persecution, Moscovici had remained cautious of the Soviet Union, and informed himself about its crimes. His young friend Belu Zilber, at the time involved with the clandestine PCdR, recalls a brush with the anticommunist Moscovici some time after the Battle of Stalingrad. According to Zilber, Moscovici shouted at him that: \\"those Katyn people are coming, and they're going to kill you!\\". In summer 1943, with Petrescu, Moscovici also wrote a note to the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, detailing the \\"treason\\" of Fluera»ô and Grigorovici. The Moscovici family eventually found lodging on Bolliac Street. Kept under medical supervision by his socialist friend Nicolae Lupu, Moscovici had severe edema in his feet, and developed chronic infections.Filitti I, p.12 By October, he showed symptoms of atrial fibrillation and a decline in his mental state, with episodes of delirium.Filitti I, p.9-10 He died, after a twelve-day agony, on the morning of November 1, 1943. His funeral ceremony at Cenu»ôa Crematorium offered the occasion for an impromptu socialist demonstration. As the junior PSDR activist Ion Pas wrote in 1945, this was \\"a final protest against fascist tyranny\\".Pas, p.27-28 Moscovici left no final will, but Mira forged one to prevent the family from being evicted by the Romanianization bureau.Filitti II, p.10-11 Posterity Following the August 23 Coup of 1944, in which the PSDR played a significant part, Antonescu was toppled, and Romania made a swift return to multiparty rule. During the subsequent democratic interval, Moscovici was commemorated by Tudor Teodorescu-Brani»ôte with a belated obituary in Jurnalul de Diminea≈£ƒÉ: \\"there are very few politicians in our country to have remained faithful to an idea their whole lives. [...] In this world of ours, Ilie Moscovici was and endured a socialist. He was not dissuaded by vain ambition. He was not frightened by poverty. He was not influenced by persecution.\\"Ioan LƒÉcustƒÉ, \\"√én Bucure»ôti, acum 50 ani. Noiembrie 1945\\", in Magazin Istoric, November 1995, p. 63 Although the PSDR was rapidly expanding, claiming some 700,000 members in 1945,FrunzƒÉ, p.270 it was being undermined by the infiltration of communists, who, inspired by the Soviet occupation of Romania, worked to absorb it into a much smaller PCdR. Addressing the rank and file of the party, the pro-communist »òtefan Voitec claimed that the merger had been envisaged by Moscovici while he was still alive‚Äîa claim that is seen as \\"opportunistic\\" by journalist and historian Victor FrunzƒÉ.FrunzƒÉ, p.268 The communist takeover was effected at the congress of March 1946, and facilitated in part by Voinea's last-minute defection.FrunzƒÉ, p.275, 279, 281 The PCdR recreated itself as a \\"Workers' Party\\", while the Independent Social Democrats, led by Petrescu and Jumanca, remained active until the 1948 installment of a fully-fledged Romanian communist regime. Both leaders ended up as political prisoners of the regime (Jumanca died in prison).FrunzƒÉ, p.266, 275-286; Neagoe, p.112-113 During the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej era of Romanian communism, Moscovici's activity was almost entirely stricken out from historical records. Zilber, who fell out with the communist regime and spent 18 years as a political prisoner, noted in his memoirs that expunging Moscovici and other deceased but inconvenient socialists from the history of Romania was \\"not hard at all\\": \\"difficulties showed up only when it came to the live ones\\".»òerbulescu, p.96 Having vowed to avenge her father's death and continue his work, Mira Moscovici preserved her spiritual affiliation to non- communist socialism. After the ascendency of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu as communist leader, she frequented dissident circles and was placed under surveillance by the Securitate secret police. Rodica Palade, Dorin Tudoran, \\"TurnƒÉtoria ca voca»õie irepresibilƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 1077, October 2010 The Moscovici family maintained close contacts with Italian President Sandro Pertini, informing him about the realities of Ceau»ôescu's rule, beyond its liberalized facade. Adrian Niculescu, \\"Cum sf√Ær»ôesc tiranii\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 600, November 2001 Shortly after Romanian Revolution of 1989, which reinstated multiparty democracy, Mira Moscovici joined Sergiu Cunescu and Adrian Dimitriu in reestablishing the PSDR. »òerban RƒÉdulescu-Zoner, \\"√éntrebƒÉri care nu se pun\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 999, April 2009 The Ilie and Mira Moscovici papers, preserved by Victor FrunzƒÉ, are stored at the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and Memory of the Romanian Exile. Ilie's nephew, Serge Moscovici, was himself exposed to antisemitic persecution as a youngster, and had to perform forced labor in a factory.Alexandra Laignel-Lavastine, \\"Serge Moscovici, inqui√©teur pr√©monitoire\\", in Le Monde, April 25, 2002, p.36 He left for France in 1947, and became a major figure in social psychology, as well as a radical social theorist. Serge's son, the economist Pierre Moscovici, is a French Socialist Party politician. He has served in various ministerial posts, including as Finance Minister between 2012 and 2014. Pierre Moscovici was also one of the supervisors for Romania's European integration process.

The orchestra is managed by the Saito Kinen Foundation. History In September 1984, under the leadership of Seiji Ozawa and Kazuyoshi Akiyama, a group of Japanese musicians from all over the world gathered together in Japan to perform a series of concerts in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the death of Hideo Saito‚Äîco-founder of the Toho Gakuen School of Music and mentor to those conductors and musicians. The series of memorial concerts performed in Tokyo and Osaka became the beginning of the career of the Saito Kinen Orchestra. In the beginning of the orchestra's establishment, its members would consist of Saito's former students who agreed with Ozawa and Akiyama that they should assemble in Japan for the memorial concerts. At first they performed without payment. In 1987 the Orchestra made its first tour of Europe in Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris, and London. Between 1989 and 1991, it toured in Europe and America.

The film stars Gregg Sulkin, Garrett Clayton, Sienna Guillory, and Bella Dayne. The film had its world premiere on 4 June 2016 at the Los Angeles Film Festival and was released in theaters in the United States on 10 February 2017. Plot Teenage pranksters Brady Mannion, Sam Fuller, Jeff Mosley, and Roy, a.k.a. ‚ÄúPrankMonkey69‚Äù, successfully convince Mrs. Kolbein that an intruder is in her house and her daughter is in danger. The video of the prank phone call goes viral and the boys become well known on YouTube. With Sam alone at home for the weekend, Brady comes over and the two of them make more prank phone calls. One of their pranks involves ordering a pizza for Sam's neighbor Larry. Jeff, who delivers the pizza from the shop where he works with Peyton, becomes upset with his friends for involving him in the prank. A mysterious man who identifies himself as Mr. Lee begins repeatedly calling the boys, insisting that they do not hang up on him. Sam and Brady are initially indifferent until Mr. Lee reveals that he knows their names, addresses, and intimate details of their lives. Peyton delivers a pizza that Sam and Brady didn't order. Peyton reveals that Jeff disappeared after his earlier delivery. Sam and Peyton have an uncomfortable conversation about their relationship before Peyton leaves. Mr. Lee begins texting Sam and Brady in addition to calling. Video footage he sends them reveals that Mr. Lee is holding Brady's parents hostage at the Mannion residence. Mr. Lee prevents the boys from calling 911 by hijacking their cell phone lines. He also takes control of the house's electrical power. A video feed shows the masked Mr. Lee suffocating Roy to death with a plastic bag tied around his head. Sam finds Jeff similarly bound with a plastic bag and tied to the back door. Jeff dies soon after Sam cuts him loose. While Sam is away, Mr. Lee makes Brady an offer to kill Sam in exchange for his parents' freedom. Mr. Lee sends footage showing that he captured Peyton. Sam deduces that Brady had a private conversation with Mr. Lee, leading to a fight between the two. Brady is knocked unconscious. Mr. Lee shows Sam live footage of Peyton held prisoner. He promises to let Peyton go if Sam kills Brady. Sam restrains Brady by securing his wrist to the banister with a zip tie to prevent him from leaving. A clue of a child's image and the name Izzy leads Sam to check a previously ignored social media friend request. The Izzy account reveals that Mr. Lee had been stalking the pranksters for over a year. Sam also finds a sex video revealing that Brady had been sleeping with Peyton. Sam beats Brady again. Sam notices from a clock in the background that the video of Brady's parents is two hours behind the current time. Sam frees Brady. New video shows that Mr. Lee already killed Brady's parents. Believing that Peyton is probably dead too, the boys plan to escape and contact authorities. However, once Sam is outside, Brady locks the front door and remains behind. Sam finds a surveillance van outside in the rain. Inside the van, Sam finds Peyton and rescues her. Back in the house, Brady steps over Jeff's covered body to go out the back door. In the backyard, Brady finds Jeff's real body. Brady realizes that Mr. Lee switched places with Jeff and hid in the house. Mr. Lee catches Brady off guard and attacks him. Sam has Peyton go for help while he looks for Brady. Sam follows Peyton's screams to the backyard. A masked man suddenly lunges at Sam and Sam stabs him. The man turns out to be Brady, tied up and gagged to look like Mr. Lee in a mask so that Sam would kill him by mistake. With Sam and Peyton defeated, Mr. Lee shows up and explains his actions. When the four boys previously called Mrs. Kolbein, she dropped her phone and didn't hear the revelation that she had been pranked. Still convinced that there was an intruder in the house, Mrs. Kolbein grabbed a gun and accidentally shot her daughter Izzy. Upon realizing what she had done, Mrs. Kolbein killed herself. It's implied that Mrs. Kolbein and the young girl were Mr. Lee's wife and daughter, and he wanted to avenge their deaths. Mr. Lee knocks Sam unconscious. When Sam wakes up, he finds Peyton shot in the head. Holding a knife in one hand and a gun in the other, Sam is arrested by the police arriving at the scene. Mr. Lee successfully framed Sam for killing Peyton and Brady out of jealousy, as well as the other murders. In the epilogue, Mr. Lee begins targeting a new teen prankster.

His name persists in publishing through the Allen & Unwin company. Early life The son of John and Rebecca Allen, he was born on 26 March 1832 at Newark-on-Trent, and was educated at a private grammar school there. His father died in 1849, and in that year he was apprenticed for four years to an uncle (his mother's brother), a builder in Clerkenwell, London. He became a skilled joiner, and was employed for three and a half years in that capacity on the woodwork of the interior of Dorchester House, Park Lane. Allen and another workman worked for 79 days on a single door in the house, and Ruskin later showed a model of this door to his friends as a specimen of English craftsmanship. With John Ruskin On the foundation of the Working Men's College in 1854, Allen joined the drawing class, and became one of Ruskin's pupils there. He was offered a post in Queen Victoria's household, working on the furniture of the royal palaces; but he declined it in order to concentrate on work for Ruskin's service. He took on posts of different kinds for 50 years. For a few years Allen acted as an assistant drawing-master under Ruskin at the college. Ruskin then encouraged him to specialise in engraving, which he studied under John Henry Le Keux the line engraver; he also studied mezzotint under Thomas Goff Lupton. Allen's duties for Ruskin were various. Publisher In 1871 Ruskin decided to set up a publishing house of his own. At a week's notice, and without any previous experience of the trade, Allen started in on this enterprise. His publishing establishment was first his cottage at Keston, and later an out-house in the garden of his villa at Orpington. In the early days Ruskin's ideas on distribution hampered the business, and in time expansion of the business made for the premises in London. In 1890 Allen opened a London publishing house (trading under the name George Allen & Sons) at 8 Bell Yard, Chancery Lane; and in 1894 he moved to a larger place at 156 Charing Cross Road. There he took to general publishing, though Ruskin's works remained the major part of his business. His last project was the library edition of Ruskin's works, appearing from 1903 to its completion after his death in 1911. Death Allen was one of the original Companions of Ruskin's Guild of St. George. He died, in his seventy-sixth year, on 5 September 1907, at Orpington, and is buried in the parish churchyard there. His wife had died, in her eightieth year, eight months before him. His collection of minerals was acquired after his death by the University of Oxford. Works Allen made engravings in mixed styles, and these were included in Ruskin's later books. Of the original illustrations in Modern Painters, three were from drawings by Allen; he engraved three plates for the edition of 1888; and in all executed 90 other plates for Ruskin. As with some of the other assistants, his work has sometimes been mistaken for Ruskin's. Family Allen was brought further into connection with Ruskin by marrying (25 December 1856) the latter's mother's maid, Anne Eliza Hobbes. They had four sons and four daughters. The eldest daughter, Grace Allen, and the two eldest sons, William and Hugh, carried on the family business after their father's death. In 1911 George Allen & Sons amalgamated with Swan Sonnenschein & Co. Ltd. (see William Swan Sonnenschein) and became George Allen & Co. Ltd. In 1913 the firm became insolvent and it was taken over by Stanley Unwin, emerging as George Allen and Unwin.Frank Arthur Mumby and Frances Helena Swan Stallybrass, From Swan Sonnenschein to George Allen & Unwin Ltd., London: Allen & Unwin, 1955, pp. 7-8.

Gameplay The game features returning leaders from the original Civilization Revolution, such as Abraham Lincoln and Napoleon Bonaparte, along with new leaders such as Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. Players are tasked with building an empire from one of several choices, including Japan, America, Russia. Once a player has founded their capital, one may start research and city production. Other civilizations are also on the map, whom the player can discuss world leaders with and trade technologies. There are four ways to win the game: Domination (capture all enemy capitals), Economic (collect 20,000 gold pieces and build the World Bank), Cultural (acquire 20 converted cities, wonders, or great people, then build the United Nations), and Science (be the first to launch a spaceship to Alpha Centauri). Each victory has different ways of achieving it. Releases The iOS version of the game was released in July 2014. An Android version of the game was released on November 7, 2014. A PlayStation Vita version of the game, entitled Civilization Revolution 2 Plus, was announced in October 2015. Adding exclusive scenarios, units and world leaders (including Oda Nobunaga, Heihachiro Togo and Himiko), the game was set for release globally on December 3, 2015. Ultimately it only launched in Asia on that date, whereas the western release was delayed twice\\"> before coming out on late March 2016.

It was later reprinted in the ‚ÄúMedical Essays‚Äù in 1855. It is included as Volume 38, Part 5 of the Harvard Classics series. Synopsis In just under 12,000 words Holmes argues forcefully and convincingly that the rampant infection killing women within a few days of childbirth was caused mainly through infection spread by their birth attendants. He also laid down well-thought out and easy to execute behaviors through which the spread of infection could be contained. History Holmes developed an interest in puerperal fever by accident. In 1836 Holmes graduated from Harvard Medical School. He was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth College from 1838 to 1840. In 1840 Holmes went back to Boston, took up general practice, and joined the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. At one of the meetings of the Society a report was presented about a physician who had performed a post mortem examination of a woman who had died from puerperal fever. Within a week that doctor himself died of infection, seemingly contracted when he was wounded during the autopsy he had conducted on the dead woman. The report stated that during the time interval between when the physician received the wound and then subsequently died from it, all the women whom he had attended during childbirth contracted puerperal fever. This report seems to have convinced Holmes that ‚ÄúThe disease, known as Puerperal Fever, is so far contagious as to be frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.‚Äù The end of the essay included eight steps which birth attendants needed to adhere to in order to prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient, especially infected patients to susceptible women after childbirth. Until this time in history these eight rules were the most definitive standard so far published on the control of this terrifying illness. Adhering to these protocols no doubt saved innumerable lives around the world. Unfortunately the essay did not enjoy the early and wide distribution which it deserved. The essay first came to light as a paper read before the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. The Society asked that the essay be published as a paper in the New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery in April 1843. Due to low circulation of this specialized journal and the fact that the journal was discontinued after just one year, the paper was not properly brought to the attention of either physicians or the public at large. In 1852 Dr. James Copeland mentioned the Holmes essay positively in his well-respected Dictionary of Practical Medicine. Dr. Copeland, who was the Consulting Physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital in London, affirmed the contagiousness of puerperal fever by pointing out that \\"Dr. Holmes has forcibly and eloquently brought this much neglected subject before the profession.\\" Dr. Copeland unfortunately also added that there was no consensus on the infectiousness of puerperal fever with such eminent experts as Hulme, Leake, Hull, Beaudeloque, Tonnell√©, Dug√©, Dewees and others still denying this fact. Twelve years after the original publication in 1843 Holmes reprinted his essay in 1855 as a private publication. He entitled it ‚ÄúPuerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence.‚Äù He had two main reasons for the reprint: first, because of the poor distribution of the essay at first; and second, to warn his fellow doctors and convince them of the contagiousness of puerperal fever. Holmes added a preface to the original essay, stating all the issues, deflating the pretensions of the professors who were still denying the cause of the fever, and warning medical students of the illogical nature of their arguments.

The first pair of lighthouses were erected here in the 16th century by the Guild of the Blessed Trinity of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. By following a course which kept the two lights aligned, pilots were able to navigate along the Tyne, avoiding the dangerous Shields Bar and the Black Middens. Earliest lights Site of the Black Friars' church: its stones were used to build the first pair of navigation lights at North Shields. In 1536, a charter of Henry VIII gave permission to the Guild of the Blessed Trinity (which is known today as Trinity House of Newcastle) to build and embattle a pair of towers on the north bank of the River Tyne to serve as leading lights for safe navigation at the mouth of the river. The granting of the charter coincided with Henry's policy of dissolving England's monasteries and in 1539 he gave the monastic church of the town's Blackfriars monastery to the Guild, which used its stonework to build the two towers. Work began on the towers the following year: they were built on high and low ground either side of Pow burn, which flows into the Tyne at 'the Narrows' (the narrowest point of the river mouth). A keeper was paid 20 shillings a year to keep a tallow candle alight in each tower every night for a certain number of hours either side of high tide. To fund the provision and maintenance of these lights the Guild was empowered to levy dues on every ship entering the port (initially 2d per English vessel and 4d per foreign vessel). In 1608 a further ordinance was issued by James I requiring Newcastle's Trinity House to maintain a pair of lighthouses at North Shields. The towers were increased in height at around this time; they are depicted on Ralph Gardner's map of 1655, still with their battlements (they were built with a defensive as well as a navigational purpose in mind). The changing position of sandbanks in the mouth of the river meant that the lights had likewise to change position from time to time. To try to address this, the lighthouses were replaced in 1658 by moveable wooden structures; these proved unreliable, however, and in the 1680s Newcastle's Trinity House was seeking funds to repair the stone towers. In 1672 the Low Light found itself enclosed by Clifford's Fort, constructed that year to help defend the Tyne from coastal attack. A postern in the fort wall provided access to the lighthouse; however, in the years that followed a number of disputes arose between Trinity House and the Governor of the Fort. These came to a head in 1726 when a new Governor's House was built on the site, which obscured the light. It seems likely that this is what prompted the rebuilding of both lights in 1727. Old High and Low Lights The Old Low Light viewed from the south Initially, the 1727 High and Low Lights were each lit by three tallow candles. Copper reflectors were added in 1736, and in 1773 the candles were replaced by oil lamps. The Low Light was repaired and remodelled in 1733 and again in 1775 when the second floor was added. By 1805 the lights were no longer aligned with river channel and Newcastle Trinity House began building a new pair of lights in 1808 =Decommissioning and aftermath= When the New High and Low Lights were commissioned in 1810 the old lights were taken out of service and the white fa√ßade of the low light was painted black (to prevent it being confused with the new light when viewed from the water). In due course both Old Lights were converted by Trinity House into almshouses; the Old Low Light, with the addition of a pitched roof, reopened as Trinity Alms House in 1830. At some later date the Old High Light became a private dwelling, and it remains so today; it is a grade II listed building. The Old Low Light is also grade II listed and, as part of Clifford's Fort, stands within a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It served as a fish warehouse during the 20th century; saved from dereliction in 1988, it became a training centre for the Deep Sea Fisheries Association and latterly was occupied by the Maritime Volunteer Service. By the early 21st century the building was in a poor state of repair, but it was comprehensively refurbished after the MVS departed in 2011 and a modern annexe with viewing platform was added. The Old Low Light subsequently opened to the public in 2014 as a museum and community resource; it contains a ground-floor caf√©, a permanent exhibition on the first floor (telling the history of the lighthouses, Clifford's Fort and Fish Quay) and an event space above it. New High and Low Lights Looking out to sea past the Low Light (left) and High Light (right). Work on the new lights was begun in 1807; both were designed for Trinity House, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, by local architect John Stokoe (1756‚Äì1836). Both towers are of white-painted ashlar, the High Light of four storeys, the Low Light of six, with curved windows; in each case the east face of the tower, facing the sea, is left plain and windowless (except on the lantern stage at the top where the lights shone out to sea). Above the lantern stage is a curved roof topped by a chimney. The lights were first lit on 1 May 1810. Each has a house attached for its keepers: that on the Low Light is dated 1816, while that on the High Light has a plaque with the Trinity House arms recording its rebuilding in 1860. By 1861 both lighthouses were lit by gas, each being equipped with a single burner set within a silvered reflector. In 1883 responsibility for the two lights was transferred from Newcastle Trinity House to the Tyne Improvement Commission. In December 1927, the Commission converted the two lights from incandescent gas to electricity. The new 100,000 candle-power lights had a range of ; they were fitted with automatic lamp changers and an incandescent gas lamp was also retained as an emergency standby in the event of a power cut. =Decommissioning= In the late 1990s the lighthouse at Herd Groyne on the opposite bank of the Tyne had a sector light installed for navigation into Tynemouth and along the river, whereupon the High and Low Lights were decommissioned and the buildings sold for housing. The towers, however, continue to serve as daymarks for vessels entering the Tyne and both are listed buildings. Each New Light stands close to its predecessor: the Low Lights are on Fish Quay and the High Lights on Tyne Street, on the ridge above the quay.

Geography The State of Udaipur was bounded by Surguja State and Jashpur State on its northern side, on the east by Gangpur State and the British Ranchi district, on the south by Raigarh State and on the west by the British Bilaspur district of the Central Provinces. In 1881 the State contained 196 villages and covered an area of 2,732 square km. The total population according to the 1901 Census of India was around 45,000, mostly Hindus. The state was mostly covered by forested hills of sandstone with carboniferous strata, but the extensive coalfields were not exploited. Gold and iron were also found, but in much smaller quantities. The ranges in the area of the state were relatively low, the highest point being Lotta Hill, reaching an elevation of 640 m. The forests were dense, composed mainly of sƒÅl, mahua, kusum and tendu. The Mand River rises near Girsa in Surguja, draining the southern part of the Mainpat Plateau to the north.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 24, p. 83. History Udaipur State was founded in 1818 as an offshoot of Surguja State (Surguja). From 1860 the rulers were Rajputs of the Raksel dynasty. The younger son of Maharaja Amar Singh Deo of Surguja State was granted the rule of Udaipur State. The first Rajput Raksel ruler was Raja Bahadur Bindeshwari Prasad Singh Deo CSI. The family of the Raja is very ancient, and is stated to belong to the Rajputs of the Lunar race. The present ruling family is said to be descended from a Raksel Raja of Palamau. The state became a British protectorate in 1818. In 1852 the ruler and his two brothers were accused by the British of murder and were jailed. There was an interregnum during which the state was ruled directly by the British authorities who invoked the doctrine of lapse. Finally in 1860 local rule was restored when Lal Bindeshwari Prasad Singh Deo was granted the rule of Udaipur State by the British for his services in the Sepoy Mutiny. He was succeeded by Swasti Sri Prabal Pratap Udit Pratap Sampanna Sitare Hind Maharajadhiraj kumar Rajadhiraj Sri Srimant Raja Bahadur Bindeshwari Prasad Singh Deo CSI (1829‚Äì1876), ruling chief Udaipur state. The Chief resided at Partabpur, the headquarters of a tract which he held as a maintenance grant in Surguja, and was a ruler of considerable ability and force of character. In 1871 he aided in the suppression of a rebellion in the Keonjhar State, for which he received the thanks of Government, and gifts of an elephant with gold-embroidered trappings and a gold watch and chain. He obtained the title of Raja Bahadur as a personal distinction, and was also made a Companion of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India. The Elder son of the chief succeeded to gaddi Sri Raja Bahadur Dharamjeet Singh Deo and younger son Sri Lal Shaheb Dharampal Singh Deo was granted the estate of Dhourpur. Lal Saheb Dharampal Singh Deo was the Grandson of Maharaja Bahadur Amar Singh Deo of \\"Surguja state\\" and younger son of Raja Bindeshwari prasad Singh Deo of Udaipur state (Dharamjaigarh). Dhourpur and Dharamjaigarh were named after both the brother Lal Saheb Dharampal Singh Deo and Raja Bahadur Dharamjeet Singh Deo. Sri Lal Saheb Dhrampal Singh Deo was succeeded by his only son Sri Lal Saheb Chandeshwer Prasad Singh Deo as the head of the jagirdari estate of Dhourpur.

Compare: Compare: Domains can be identified using a domain name; domains which need to be accessible from the public Internet can be assigned a globally unique name within the Domain Name System (DNS). A domain controller is a server that automates the logins, user groups, and architecture of a domain, rather than manually coding this information on each host in the domain. It is common practice, but not required, to have the domain controller act as a DNS server. That is, it would assign names to hosts in the network based on their IP addresses. Example Half of the staff of Building A uses Network 1, 192.168.10.0/24. This network has the VLAN identifier of VLAN 10. The other half of the staff of Building A uses Network 2, 192.168.20.0/24. This network has the VLAN identifier of VLAN 20. All of the staff of Building B uses Network 3, 192.168.0.0/24. This has the VLAN identifier of VLAN 11. The router R1 serves as the gateway for all three networks, and the whole infrastructure is connected physically via ethernet. Network 2 and 3 are routed through R1 and have full access to each other. Network 1 is completely separate from the other two, and does not have access to either of them. Network 2 and 3 are therefore in the same network domain, while Network 1 is in its own network domain, albeit alone. A network administrator can then suitably name these network domains to match the infrastructure topology. Usage  Use of the term \\"network domain\\" first appeared in 1965 and saw increasing usage beginning in 1985. It initially applied to the naming of radio stations based on broadcast frequency and geographic area. It entered its current usage by network theorists to describe solutions to the problems of subdividing a single homogeneous LAN and joining multiple networks, possibly constituted of different network architectures.

Initially, the application's only function was to send the user's friends the word \\"yo\\" as a text and audio notification, but it has since been updated to enable users to attach links and location to their \\"Yo\\"s. History Yo was created by Israeli developer Or Arbel in eight hours at the request of Moshe Hogeg, CEO of Mobli, who asked Arbel to design a single- button app to send a notification to his assistant or wife. It was launched on April Fools' Day 2014 for Android and iOS, though initially rejected by Apple for being too simple. The app was only shared with Mobli employees to start, however 20,000 people were using the app within the first month of release. The app was shared on the Product Hunt website, through which it exploded in popularity. Following a wide range of interest from investors, the app received USD$1 million in investment, including from Hogeg himself. In July 2014 the app was also released for Windows Phone. The app was valued at between $5 and $10 million in the same month and received a further $1.5 million in funding. Arbel stated interest in expanding the app to include more functionality, including a possible feature which could be used by bloggers to send their followers a 'yo' with a link to the blog attached whenever they post an update; the feature has since been implemented. The app's first content update was released in August 2014, adding extra functionality to it, including the ability to send web links and hashtags, and creating user profiles. On 20 June 2014, Isaiah Turner hacked the app, allowing him to retrieve any user's phone number and spam/spoof 'Yo's to any user. After the exploit was fixed, Arbel hired him to work for the company. In October the same year, the app introduced functionality to enable users to send their location to other users. In June 2015, Yo released the second version of their app with a number of new features. The user interface was updated to allow users to send photos or their location within 1 swipe and a tap from the home screen. The new version also enabled users to collect their friends in to groups so that they could \\"Yo\\" a number of people with 1 tap. In 2016 the Yo company shut down. Arbel and other employees had since moved on to other jobs, and Arbel described the app as running on \\"autopilot\\". Arbel opened a Patreon account to continue funding maintenance of the app in 2018.  Features  The app enables users to send individual notifications to other users, simply containing the word \\"Yo\\". Users can additionally send their location. Yo is an option for the IFTTT service. The app has an API, which has enabled developers and brands to send a Yo to groups of users, such as when the World Cup sent a Yo every time a goal was scored. FedEx set up a service using the app through which users could receive a Yo when their package was being delivered. Reception Since its release, Yo has been downloaded over 3 million times and by 2016 over 100 million 'Yo's had been sent. Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley, expressed interest in the app due to its simplicity. At the height of its popularity the app reached the number 4 position on the iOS App Store and #1 in the social networking category. Similar apps A number of apps inspired by Yo have been released, including one which sends the word 'Hodor', and one which sends the Indian word 'aiyo'. The app has also been adapted to warn Israeli citizens of missile strikes. An app called Lo was partly inspired by Yo, sending only a user's location. In July 2014 some of the copies and parodies received copyright complaints from Yo, with Arbel saying \\"Yo has spawned many clones... some of them are a complete replication of the Yo app... Improving upon our concept is welcomed, copying us bit-by-bit isn‚Äôt.\\". In August of 2014, Tom Scott and Matt Gray created Emojli, an emoji only messenger app, partly inspired by the success of Yo.

It is a branch of the Slovak Technical Museum in Ko≈°ice and is located near the Ko≈°ice International Airport, on the outskirts of the city. It opened on August 23, 2002. After a general reconstruction and enlargement period that lasted since 2004, the museum reopened on September 2, 2006.  Collections and exhibits  Its collections include a wide variety of heavier- than-air aircraft, aircraft engines and other technical accessories from various eras of aviation, with a focus on Slovak and European aviation history. Aircraft are displayed both indoors and in open-air displays on the museum's grounds. As of 2014, the collections include over 60 types of civilian and military aircraft from various periods and countries of origin, sans larger airliners. The three main exhibits of the museum are displayed in three interconnected exhibition halls. They consist of collections pertaining to the development of aviation in Europe, Czechoslovakia and Slovakia until the end of World War II (i.e. the pre-jet era), the development of aviation in Czechoslovakia during the Cold War (jet era, 1950s domestic helicopter developments), and the development of aviation elsewhere in Europe during the Cold War, in that order. The aircraft inventory of the third exhibition consists largely of decommissioned military jet aircraft donated by the governments and militaries of various European countries and the United States. Due to the donations commonly being addressed to a current Slovak president, the exhibit is often dubbed \\"The Presidential Aircraft Gallery\\". The museum's collection of former Slovak Air Force aircraft is one of the largest in the country. Several of the decommissioned aircraft are kept in storage, awaiting restoration work. Smaller side exhibits focus on aviation- related technological accessories (mostly from the jet age), sports aviation history and related topics, and model aircraft displays.

Considered as one of Germany's most promising wrestlers in his decade, Zamanduridis has claimed two medals (one silver and one bronze) in the 68-kg division at the World Championships (1990 and 1995), but took an early hiatus shortly to focus on his coaching staff for the German wrestling team. In 2003, Zamanduridis suddenly came out of his impending retirement to compete for Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout his sporting career, Zamanduridis trained full time as a member of the wrestling club for KSV K√∂llerbach, under his personal coach Frank Hartmann. Background Born in Chemnitz to his Greek-born parents, Zamanduridis and the rest of his family escaped from the East Germany regime shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He moved to P√ºttlingen in Saarbrucken, and started his career as a member of the wrestling team for KSV K√∂llerbach. His first major sporting debut came at the 1990 World Wrestling Championships in Ostia, Italy, where Zamanduridis earned a silver medal in the 68-kg division, losing out to the former Soviet Union's Islam Dugushiev. Since then, Zamanduridis held a stunning record of top three finishes from the German Grand Prix, and produced a bronze medal in the same category at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships in Prague. He also sought to qualify for the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics, but declined his bid. Just after his bronze medal triumph from the World Championships, Zamanduridis decided to take a short hiatus from the sport to focus his own career as a full-time national coach for the German wrestling team. Out of retirement In December 2002, Zamanduridis announced that he would come out of retirement to compete again in wrestling. At the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Cr√©teil, France, he lost the quarterfinal match 1‚Äì3 in overtime to Ukraine's Armen Vardanyan. Despite leaving the tournament without a medal, Zamanduridis granted a ticket to his first Olympics and was officially selected to the German Olympic team, as he landed into the seventh spot of the world's final rankings. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Zamanduridis qualified for the German squad, as a 38-year-old veteran, in the men's 66 kg class. He lost his opening match 2‚Äì3 to Kazakhstan's Mkhitar Manukyan, but pulled himself into a powerful 5‚Äì2 lead to thrash U.S. wrestler Oscar Wood in his second bout. When Zamanduridis faced off against Greece's Konstantinos Arkoudeas in front of a massive home crowd inside Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, he tried to throw the Greek in the opening minute, but could not hold him tighter inside the mat in overtime, and lost the match with another 2‚Äì3 sudden death decision. Zamanduridis finished third in the preliminary competition and ninth overall; he did not advance to the quarterfinals. Two wrestlers were disqualified by a forfeit in a special consolation round so Zamanduridis' overall rank was upgraded to seventh. Coaching career Zamanduridis began his career for the German wrestling team as an assistant coach in 1996, but took a year off from the job, when he made his official comeback to compete again in wrestling. Shortly after his first Olympic Games, Zamanduridis returned to the scene as part of the coaching staff for the wrestling team, and then became a national coach. In January 2013, Zamanduridis was appointed as the national sports director for the German Wrestling Federation.

Education Professor Jackson was educated at the University of Leeds, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry in 1983.‚ÄòJACKSON, Prof. Stephen Philip‚Äô Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2013 He then carried out his PhD research working with Jean Beggs on yeast RNA splicing at Imperial College London and Edinburgh University, earning his PhD in 1987. Research Following his PhD, Jackson carried out postdoctoral research with Robert Tjian at the University of California, Berkeley, where he developed an interest in the regulation of transcription. He returned to the UK in 1991 as a Junior Group Leader at the then Wellcome-CRC Institute, now the Gurdon Institute. Jackson's work has provided key insights into cellular processes that respond to DNA damage; processes fundamental to life and whose defects cause various diseases particularly cancer. Through his discovery that the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) enzyme is activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), Jackson's laboratory identified and characterised various components of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) system that repairs most DSBs in human cells. These studies also provided a paradigm for Jackson's later work on DNA-damage signalling by the ATM serine/threonine kinase and ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related), and his studies on how these and additional DNA repair factors interact with and influence one another, often in ways regulated by post-translational modifications. Jackson's work has also helped establish how DSB repair is controlled during the cell cycle, at telomeres in response to cell aging/senescence, and within chromatin. In 1997 Jackson founded KuDOS Pharmaceuticals with the aim of translating knowledge of DNA damage response pathways into new treatments for cancer. KuDOS developed small-molecule inhibitors of several DNA damage response enzymes. The most advanced of these is the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor Olaparib/Lynparza‚Ñ¢, which is now a registered medicine worldwide. KuDOS developed into a fully integrated drug-discovery and drug-development company and was acquired by AstraZeneca in 2005. In 2011 Jackson founded MISSION Therapeutics a firm to develop drugs to improve the management of life- threatening diseases, particularly cancer. In 2017, Steve founded Adrestia Therapeutics Ltd and currently serves as Chief Executive and Chief Scientific Officer. Honours and awards Jackson has received numerous awards, medals and honorary degrees: the inaugural Eppendorf-Nature European Young Investigator Award (1995); the Tenovus Medal for Cancer Research (1997); the Colworth Medal (1997); the Anthony Dipple Carcinogenesis Young Investigator award (2002); the Biochemical Society GlaxoSmithKline Award (2008);GlaxoSmithKline Award Lecture the BBSRC Innovator of the Year Award (2009);Innovator of the Year the Royal Society Buchanan Medal (2011), the latter in recognition of his \\"outstanding contributions to understanding DNA repair and DNA damage response signalling pathways\\", and the Gagna A. & Ch. Van Heck Prize (2015) for \\"his cardinal contributions related to cellular events that detect, signal the presence of and repair DNA damages\\". Jackson is the co-winner of the King Faisal International Prize for Science 2016, in recognition of his \\"outstanding contribution to defining the link between the basic mechanism of genomic DNA instability and its relationship to cancer. Specifically, he unraveled the salient components of the pathway involved in DNA repair. He is also credited with an innovative approach to bring his findings into tangible therapeutic products to treat cancer\\". He was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 1997, a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2001 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2008. In 2016 Jackson was awarded the Dr A.H. Heineken Prize for Medicine for his \\"fundamental research into DNA repair in human cells and for the successful application of knowledge of that process in the development of new cancer drugs\\". In 2017 he was awarded the Genome Stability Network medal for his contributions to the field of genome stability and particularly for the realisation of the therapeutic potential of targeting the DDR. The Fondation ARC's Leopold Griffuel Prize in Translational and Clinical Research was presented to Jackson in 2019 for his work on DNA damage repair and his role in the development of medicines such as PARP1 and 2 inhibitors, currently used for cancer treatment.

Early life  Jeffes was born in London to the artist Emily Young and musician and composer, Simon Jeffes. Jeffes's interest in experimental music was recognised by his father when he took a hammer to the keys of his father's piano. While both of his parents nurtured his musicality he was encouraged to base any career on a strong academic background. He read Archaeology and Anthropology at Trinity College, Cambridge.  Penguin Cafe  In 2007, original members of Penguin Cafe Orchestra performed a series of three memorial concerts, with Arthur Jeffes performing onstage with the band for the first time, to mark ten years since Simon Jeffes' death. Encouraged by the public response to the Union Chapel concerts, which all sold out, Jeffes decided that keeping his father's music alive was a worthwhile endeavour. He founded a new band, Penguin Cafe, with a new line-up, including Cass Browne of Gorillaz, Neil Codling of Suede, Oli Langford of Florence and the Machine and Darren Berry of Razorlight. Penguin Cafe have performed on stage playing works of Simon Jeffes and their own pieces.

She founded the Croman Tenants Association; the Coalition to Protect Public Housing and Section 8; and Co-op Watch, to prevent evictions through phony conversions. She started campaigns to organize tenants against aggressive landlords, phony demolitions, and harassment in and around Chinatown and Little Italy.\\"http://www.oldstreets.com/honor.asp?title=Freeman Life Janet Freeman grew up in Stuyvesant Town, a middle-income housing complex in Manhattan, New York City. At the age of 17, she moved to Elizabeth Street, eventually occupying a vacant storefront where she lived until her death in 2011. The storefront was notable for its heavily tagged graffiti cover in a neighborhood renowned for its tagging and graffiti art -- (both the Candle Building and the Germania Bank Building (New York City) are down the block and around the corner respectively). Activism According to Tenant/Inquilino, the newspaper of Metropolitan Council on Housing: \\"Freeman was widely admired among tenant advocates for an unusual mix of impressive qualities: her intellect and insight, her personal dedication to ordinary people, her passion for their rights, and the depth, breadth, thoroughness, and accuracy of her research. She employed these in an unbroken series of actions and campaigns over three decades. Protective of her independence and integrity, and averse to bureaucracy, she almost always worked as a free agent or volunteer, even refusing paid positions for the same things she did freely.\\" =Tenant and housing activism= Freeman defended tenants whether in public housing or in private rentals threatened by predatory landlords and developers. She worked with Met Council, Cooper Square Committee, Good Old Lower East Side (GOLES), University Settlement, and the Coalition for a District Alternative (CoDA). She helped create the Lower East Side Coop Watch, a campaign to protect tenants from hazardous conditions created by landlords in illegal, coercive co-op conversions, resulting in DOB and HPD action to force repairs for tenants‚Äôsafety. She also helped create the Croman Tenants Association, Justice for Lincoln Swados (Lincoln was a disabled man who died when his door was blocked during building renovations), was a founding member of the Lower East Side Coalition to Save Public Housing & Section 8 to mobilize and educate tenants, lead organizer of tenants in Extell owned buildings on the LES to prevent evictions, and worked for the City Wide Task Force for Housing. Through her briefs and oral arguments she set the precedent that stipulations could include owner repairs to Department of Buildings and Environmental Control Board violations. For the 37 Spring Street Tenant Association, she represented the tenants in Housing Court. This case broke Housing Court precedent as the first time a landlord was mandated to correct not only HPD violations but also violations with DOB and DEP, allowing all tenants citywide to bring greater scrutiny in Housing Court to DOB failures in regulation. For the 196 Elizabeth Street Freeman advised tenants who were displaced by a fire in their tenement building and were unable to regain their home when the landlord failed to rehabilitate the apartments as stipulated by the Court. For the 167 Elizabeth Street she organized the tenants‚Äô association within her own building when the landlord refused to make repairs and threatened residents who made complaints. Janet provided advice as to how to register complaints and set up a rent strike, while protecting the tenants‚Äô rights under New York City Law. One of these repairs was for an elderly, top-floor tenant with a disabled adult daughter, who had not had running water in their toilet for three years. Freeman organized tenants in nine Croman-owned buildings in Little Italy to document violations and other conditions in preparation for legal action against the landlord, eventually creating a coalition with other Croman-owned building tenants on the Lower East Side, leading to a meeting with the NYS Attorney General about a general pattern of landlord harassment against long-term tenants.http://www.villagevoice.com/news/atrocious-nyc- landlord-steve-croman-charged- with-20-felonies-8599882http://www.villagevoice.com/news/there-goes-the- neighborhood-6394757 She saved the homes of dozens of individual Little Italy tenants facing eviction, providing her expertise on her own time. Freeman organized and helped individual tenants while also working at a macro level for policy change to preserve affordable housing, and was indispensable to local community organizations including Cooper Square Committee, Good Old Lower East Side (GOLES), Citywide Task Force on Housing (now Housing Court Answers), Metropolitan Council on Housing and Project Home at University Settlement. She assisted a 1995 Joint Planning Council study of displacement, surveying residents, mapping out strategies, doing tenant outreach and organizing buildings. Freeman organized low-income tenants in Little Italy, Chinatown and the Lower East Side in collaboration with Project Home at University Settlement, to inform them of their rights, help them fight evictions and illegal conversions, and to gain repairs to their buildings, often accompanying tenants to Court. She organized, trained, counseled and educated tenants coming to GOLES and Met Council as direct services to address displacement and other issues affecting low-income communities. As staff member of HCA, she advocated for Court reform and worked a table at Housing Court to provide information to hundreds of tenants facing eviction, often continuing to research details for individual tenants on her own time.http://metcouncilonhousing.org/news_and_issues/tenant_newspaper/2011/july- august/tenant_advocates_mourn_janet_freeman_brilliant_and_passionatehttp://thevillager.com/villager_421/janetfreeman.html =Neighborhood activism= Freeman's earliest effort was to help get trees planted on the street where she lived.

Andrew Chinn (1915‚Äì1996) was a Chinese-American artist and art educator, active in the Pacific Northwest from the early 1930s through the 1990s. He is known for his distinctive style of watercolor painting and printmaking, and is associated with the Northwest's Asian-American arts community, the WPA artists of the Great Depression/World War II era, and, peripherally, the Northwest School of painters. Life and career Andrew Nan Chinn's parents emigrated from Toyshan, Canton (modern Taishan, Guangdong), China, to the United States in about 1910. He was born in Seattle, Washington, on June 17, 1915. After his mother died of influenza in 1918, he and his older sister Ann returned to Toyshan, where, with the encouragement of his grandfather, he learned traditional calligraphy. He also became interested in painting, which, in China of the Sun Yat Sen era, was beginning to show the influence of modern European trends.Oral history interview with Andrew Chinn, by Matthew Kangas, Aug. 9, 1991; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution Chinn returned to the US in 1927, went back to China in 1929, and then moved to Seattle for good in 1933. He attended Broadway High School, where his classmates included artists Fay Chong, George Tsutakawa, and Morris Graves. He, Chong, and other young artist friends formed the Chinese Art Club, holding monthly shows at a shared studio in Seattle's International District.

He worked alongside Graves, Chong, Guy Anderson, Helmi Juvonen, Jacob Elshin, Julius Twohy, and other notable painters, printmakers, and sculptors. In 1945 he began a 31-year career as a technical artist at the Boeing company, and became a founder of the Boeing Art Club; around this time he was also accepted for membership in the Puget Sound Group, the Northwest's oldest artists' association.\\"Andrew Chinn, 80, Painter Of Nature, Art Teacher\\", The Seattle Times, by Carole Beers; Jan. 16, 1996 In 1946 he began teaching evening classes in watercolor painting at Seattle Central Community College (originally Edison Technical School), which he would continue to do for over 45 years. While the Abstract expressionism of the Northwest mystics turned the art world on its head in the 1950s, and George Tsutakawa, Paul Horiuchi, and Frank Okada revolutionized Asian-American art in the 1960s, Chinn remained almost defiantly committed to the style he'd developed and loved most: traditional Asian art (often including Chinese calligraphic inscriptions) done using Western perspective, with aspects of American realism and European impressionism. An avid outdoorsman, his subject matter was most commonly the natural scenery that he loved. He usually painted from life, instead of using photos or sketches. Although his more conservative style kept him out of Seattle's avant-garde galleries, he remained a well-respected figure in the Pacific Northwest, and had his work regularly exhibited in the area's mainstream museums and galleries. Chinn died of heart failure on January 9, 1996, while teaching at Seattle Central Community College. He was married to Mary Chinn for 55 years. They had two sons, Dennis and Terry, and a daughter, Maryann.

This reduced the Conservatives to 31 of the 38 seats on the council, Labour went up to 4 seats, UKIP won their first 2 seats, while the Liberal Democrats remained on 1 seat. Overall turnout at the election was 32.8%, up from 27.5% at the 2012 election. The UKIP gains from the Conservatives came in Hayling East, where John Perry took the seat after a recount, and in Stakes ward, where Gary Kerrin won by 34 votes after the Conservative councillor Olwyn Kennedy stood down at the election. Meanwhile, in the only other change Labour's Beryl Francis gained Warren Park from the Conservatives, after Mark Johnson did not stand for re- election.

He made the pilgrimage to the Holy Land as a young man. He became commander of the order at a time when Protestants were gaining control of northern Europe. He managed to resist demands to dissolve the order and use its property for charity. Soon after his death the order became a Protestant organization. Early years Jacob Taets van Amerongen was the eldest son of Johan Taets van Amerongen, lord of Groenewoude (died 18 January 1589) and Johanna van Gaesbeek (died 26 February 1578). Both his father and his grandfather, Ernst Taets van Amerongen (died 1565), had served as burgomasters of the city of Utrecht. Other relatives were senior clergymen. Jacob Taets van Amerongen studied in Louvain (1560), Orleans (1565) and Pavia (1568). Jacob Taets left on 1569 for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, as his great-uncle Anthonis and great-great-grandfather Ernst (died 1473) had done. According to the German knight Hans von Hirnheim, he landed in Jaffa on 30 August 1569. In 1572 Jacob Taets joined the Natio Germanica at the University of Padua, a lawyer's association. He belonged to the Jerusalem confraternity, whose members planned or had undertaken a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He also belonged to the Kleine Kalende confraternity, an exclusive society in Utrecht that in theory was restricted to the nobility. Teutonic Order Jacob Taets was appointed house commander of the Teutonic Knights' Bailiwick of Utrecht on 20 May 1576, managing the order's household officials, servants and stores, and leading the order in the absence of the land commander. Under his leadership the convent church employed three secular priests, a sacristan, a chantry priest, a sexton, four choristers and an organist. The services were held frequently, followed traditional practices such as foot-washing for the poor on Maundy Thursdays, and were fully attended. In October 1579 Taets became land commander. He succeeded Frans van der Loe. Taets tried to restore the order to its former religious nature, and to confirm the allegiance of the Utrecht bailiwick to the Emperor and the Deutschmeister. Taets resisted demands by the States of Utrecht that Catholic institutions be dissolved and their goods used for charity. In 1580 he argued that the goods \\"belonged to our Lord the German Master\\", and that the Bailiwick was a knightly institution that served \\"where necessary to fight with weapons for the defence of the Empire against our common arch enemy, the Turk...\\" In 1594 Taets sent two knights from Utrecht to Bad Mergentheim to join brothers from the Alden Biesen bailiwick in a crusade to defend the Holy Roman Empire against the Ottoman Empire. Jacob Taets van Amerongen remained land commander until his death in 1612. He died 4 December 1612. He was succeeded by Diderick de Belois van Treslong. Soon after, the Teutonic Knights became a Protestant organization. Portrait A portrait of Taets van Amerongen appears on the seventh panel of a series held in the Duitse Huis that depicts all the land commanders of the order from 1239. He in factGekoesterde traditie : de portretreeks met de landcommandeurs van de Utrechtse Balije van de Ridderlijke Duitsche Orde, (thesis) by Daantje Meuwissen; 2011, Publisher: Verloren, Hilversum, page 234 commissioned the series of portraits between May 1576, when he took office, and March 1580, when the last panel was damaged in the Beeldenstorm. His body and head were painted by different artists. He is the only commander to be shown with the signs of having made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, although one would expect that others would have done so. This may be because Taets van Amerongen commissioned the work and therefore influenced what was represented. He may have been deliberately showing the connection with the traditional Teutonic Order, founded during the crusades in the Holy Land.

About Us. 2018. https://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/about-us. This is approached in three main ways: *By raising awareness about poor numeracy levels which exist in the UK, how numeracy differs from mathematics, and the promoting the recognition that everyone can improve through campaigns such as National Numeracy Day. *By improving numeracy with the National Numeracy Challenge, a tool for users to assess and improve on their numeracy at their own pace. *By improving communication of numbers and data by helping organisations to use a ‚ÄòPlain Numbers‚Äô approach, so that anyone can understand their information regardless of their numeracy level. = Projects = * The National Numeracy Challenge is a free interactive web-based tool that aims to improve numeracy skills among the adult population of the UK. The assessment tool asks participants to complete a series of everyday maths questions at various levels of difficulty, then revealing the level of maths skill they currently have and a score out of 100. Participants are then given a target for improvement and access to free resources to learn in the areas they need to work on, encouraging them to come back and take the assessment again to see how they have improved.The Telegraph.

Retrieved: June 2014 In October 2015, the Challenge website was updated to include the ability to see which questions were answered incorrectly. In 2017, a series of attitudinal resources were incorporated into the National Numeracy Challenge, to help users build their confidence with numbers and maths. * The Numeracy Review is for employers who want to have in-depth insights into numeracy levels and attitudes to maths among their workforce. The process assesses the state of numeracy in a workplace, both in terms of maths ability and mindset among staff, using attitudinal surveys and the Challenge Online, then working with employers to address any areas that need improvement. * Challenge Champions are numeracy advocates who are based within workplaces and other settings to support colleagues in improving their numeracy and using the Challenge Online. * The Family Maths Toolkit is a project designed to engage parents and families with maths learning for children aged 13 and under, encouraging them to support their learning in the home with everyday maths activities provided by National Numeracy through schools. The project was piloted as the Parent Toolkit with 10 school across the UK in 2014-15 to find out how parental engagement with children's maths learning improved their attainment in school. The website was relaunched in September 2015 as the Family Maths Toolkit. * Passport Maths is an early intervention programme for year 7 secondary school pupils who need extra support in mathematics, helping them to progress from level 3 maths to level 4 and attain better outcomes at GCSE. * Star Dash Studios is a free smartphone game for young adults, helping them to see everyday maths in vocational settings. It is currently available for Android and Apple mobile phones. * Train the Trainer is a workshop for organisations to give their staff the confidence to deliver numeracy training in the workplace. * Department for Education project.

He was particularly notable for his research into human toxicology and the effect of contaminants on the environment in the Arctic. A professor of medicine at Laval University and the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Qu√©bec Research Center, he was also a scientific director of the World Health Organization's Collaborative Centre in Environmental Health. Biography The son of a gastroenterologist, Dewailly was interested in sociology while in his teenage years, but his focus changed to infectious diseases and protecting public health after a trip to the Ivory Coast. Dewailly's education included a degree in medicine from the University of Lille (1982), specialized studies in public health (CES, Amiens, 1983, a residency in community health (Laval University, 1983‚Äì85), a master's degree in epidemiology (Laval University, 1987), and a PhD in toxicology (University of Lille, 1990). During his career, he served as professor of medicine at Laval University, directed the Laval University Medical Centre's Public Health Research Unit, and was scientific director of the World Health Organization's Collaborative Centre in Environmental Health. He was also a professor and Scientific Director at Centre hospitalier universitaire de Qu√©bec Research Center, as well as director of the CIHR funded Nasivvik Centre for Inuit Health. Work An epidemiologist specializing specialist in human toxicology, Dewailly's research focused on the impact of oceans on human health, and was noted for his work in the Canadian Arctic. He did much work for the International Network for Circumpolar Health Research. Dewailly published notable work into breast cancer. In the late 1980s and 1990s, he conducted much research into the breast milk of Inuit women and was concerned with the high levels of chemicals found in it, containing over six times the nationally recommended level of PCBs. He made the discovery by accident after visiting the Inuit peoples in industrialized, heavily polluted Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1987 and testing a midwife from Nunavik. In 1994, he co-authored a paper documenting the unusually high level of cadmium in the blood of Inuit cigarette smokers. He was also knowledgeable about the effects of fats on the heart and human health, and spoke about the dangers of man-made trans fats and them being even worse than saturated fats. He expressed concerns about the calories in the Inuit diet consisting of more than 50% derived from fat. Dewailly once stated that he considered fats to have been \\"demonized\\" in the United States. In 2003, Dewailly contributed to the book Northern Lights Against POPs: Combatting Toxic Threats in the Arctic with Christopher Furgal, writing about the \\"Discovery of Organic Contaminants in Arctic Peoples\\" in the 1980s. In 2011 he contributed to the book Oceans and Human Health: Risks and Remedies from the Seas, writing about the \\"Exposure and effects of seafood- borne contaminants in maritime populations\\". Personal life and death Dewailly was married to Dr. Sylvie Dodin Dewailly, a professor of medicine at Laval University. He died in a rock slide accident on R√©union Island on June 17, 2014.

Military career Skene was from the branch of the family associated with Hallyards Castle.Memorials of the family of Skene of Skene: from the family papers, William Forbes Skene, Aberdeen: New Spalding Club, 1887, p. 59 He enlisted in the British army in 1739 and saw much action: the Battle of Porto Bello (1739), the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1741), the Battle of Fontenoy (1745), and the Battle of Culloden (1746). In 1756 he arrived in the British colonies in North America. In February 1757 he was promoted to the command of a company in the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot. He was wounded in Lord Howe's 1758 attack on Fort Ticonderoga. In 1759 he was appointed major of a brigade and in October of that year was left in command of Crown Point with instructions to strengthen the fortifications. While he was stationed there he became convinced that the local area was a good one for trade and settlement. With the encouragement of Lord Amherst he started a small settlement at the head of Lake Champlain, purchasing land in the area.\\"Governor Philip Skene\\", Henry Hall, The Historical Magazine, and Notes and Queries ... , Vol. 2, Second series, Morrisania, NY: Henry B. Dawson, 1867, p. 280 In 1762 Skene was sent to the Caribbean and took part in the capture of Havana, being the first through the breach into Morro Castle.Hall, p. 280 In 1763 he returned to North America and found his settlement reduced to 15 inhabitants. He travelled to England and in 1765 obtained a royal patent for a large tract of land known as Skenesborough (now the village of Whitehall). Returning to New York, he again began to develop a tenant settlement on his property. When his regiment returned to Ireland in 1768, Skene transferred to the Xth Foot, and then sold his commission in 1769. In 1770 he became a resident of his new community. Over the next 5 years he made many improvements to his property, such as a road to Salem, New York and on to Bennington known as \\"Skene's Road\\".Transactions of the New York State Agricultural Society, Vol. 8 (1848), Weed, Parsons, & Co., 1849, \\"A Historical, Topographical, and Agricultural Survey of the County of Washington\\", Asa Fitch, p. 968 He built mills, storehouses, and boats, including the schooner Katherine that later became the USS Liberty when seized by the patriots.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, entry LibertyLake Champlain Maritime Museum, American Revolution Plan for a new colony Shortly before the Revolution Ethan Allen and other leaders of the New Hampshire Grants came up with a plan to solve their disputes with the colony of New York by obtaining a charter for a new royal colony comprising the Grants and also land on the New York side of Lake Champlain. The colony was to be obtained by Skene, who would be the governor and reside at Skenesborough.A History of Lake Champlain, Walter Hill Crockett, 1909, pp. 120‚Äì1 In pursuit of this goal Skene went to England and was appointed lieutenant governor of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and royal surveyor of the woods around Lake Champlain.Hadden's Journal and Orderly Books, James M. Hadden, Albany: Joel Munsell's Sons, 1884, p. 509 He was advised to gather petitions from the inhabitants before seeking a royal patent for the new colony; Allen and others arranged a meeting at Westminster in the Grants on 11 April 1775, which approved a resolution asking \\"be taken out of so oppressive a jurisdiction and either annexed to some other government, or erected and incorporated into a new one\\". This plan was interrupted by the Revolution. It came up again during Vermont's negotiations with the British governor of Quebec in the early 1780s, where if Skene had actually obtained a secret charter (as Ira Allen and others claimed), Vermont could have been part of a larger autonomous province. American Revolution When the American Revolution began, Skene's son Andrew was arrested as Crown Point and Ticonderoga were being seized. Skene himself was returning from England; on hearing of the outbreak of the Revolution, his ship was diverted to Philadelphia. His arrival there alarmed the Continental Congress to the extent of appointing a committee headed by John Adams to look over his papers; after their report, he was sent to Connecticut under arrest.Hadden, p. 510 John Adams wrote of Skene, > We have an infernal scoundrel here, a certain Col. S‚Äî‚Äî, who comes over full > of plans and machinations of mischief. He has had the most unreserved and > unlimited confidence of Lord Dartmouth, during the whole of the past winter, > and it seems for some time before; and together with a contemptible puppy of > a parson, V‚Äî‚Äî, has been contriving to debauch, seduce, and corrupt New- > York.John Adams to Joseph Palmer, 5 July 1775 After giving parole, Skene and his son lived with Sarah Hooker at her house in West Hartford, Connecticut.Sarah Hooker House website While he was there, there was some alarm when Skene's \\"negro\\" slave John Anderson was appointed \\"governor of the negros\\" by the previous incumbent. Governor Trumbull and his council appointed a committee headed by Jesse Root to call on Skene and examine whether this was part of some plot, which Skene denied.Papers of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, Volume 6, Tuttle, Morehouse, and Taylor: New Haven, 1900, \\"Negro Governors\\", Orville Platt, pp. 327-9 Skene was eventually exchanged for James Lovell in October 1776. On his return to England in 1777 he enlisted with General John Burgoyne's expedition and was given the rank of colonel. Burgoyne used Skene's home in Skenesborough as a headquarters in early July 1777, and Skene served Burgoyne as an advisor on local conditions and a commissary. Skene was sent along with Baum's expedition that ended at the Battle of Bennington to recruit Loyalists; he was sent back by Baum to hurry along the reinforcements. As the reinforcements came up, reputedly Skene hailed some American scouts with a cry of \\"Are you for King George?\\" and got his horse shot out from under him.HistoryNet:Battle of Bennington He also may have been influential in Burgoyne's decision to cut a road from Skenesborough to Fort Edward, perhaps with a view to improving access to his settlement.With Musket and Tomahawk: The Saratoga Campaign and the Wilderness War of 1777, Michael Logusz, Havertown, PA: Casemate Printers, 2010, pp. 148-9 Skene was later part of the surrender of Burgoyne's army. Later life In 1779 Skene and his son Andrew were attainted as Loyalists by New York State, and their property seized. Skene attempted vainly to regain his property, and then appealed to the British government for compensation and received in 1784 a pension of ¬£180 per year, and later a lump sum of ¬£20,000, which he used to purchase property in Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire.Philip Skene bio on Uelac.org siteSkene, p. 59 He died in 1810 at his home Addersey Lodge, near Stoke Goldington and Hartwell, and is buried in the chapel at Hartwell. Family Skene's father James Skene was a Jacobite who was captured at the Battle of Preston in 1715 and several times narrowly avoided execution; he died in 1736. His mother was Mary Ann Smith, the daughter of a Battersea minister. Skene's brother James was a surgeon for the East India Company. He died in 1780 in London. Skene himself married Katherine Heyden, an heiress from Ireland, and they had three children: Andrew Philip (b. 1753), Mary Ann Margaret (b. 1755), and Katherine (b. 1756).Skene, pp. 58-9 References Further reading *Philip Skene of Skenesborough, Doris Begor Morton, Granville, NY: Grastorf Press, 1959 Category:1725 births Category:1810 deaths Category:Military personnel from London Category:Loyalists in the American Revolution from New York (state) Category:Scottish soldiers ","title":"Philip Skene"},{"id":"43125109","text":"Somalinautilus is a genus of nautiloids that is found in the Middle to Upper Jurassic of England, France, and Somaliland. The genus contains three species, S. antiquus, first assigned to Nautilus by Dacque in 1910, S. fuscus, first assigned to Nautilus in 1898, and S. clausus, first used under Nautilus in 1890. Another species of Nautilus was named in 1905, N. bisculatus, which is now a synonym of S. antiquus. Two features that differentiate Somalinautilus are that the venter is arched and low, and its ventral shoulders are subangular. This distinguishes Somalinautilus from its close relatives Paracenoceras, Tithonoceras, and Aulaconautilus. Tithonoceras is closest related to Paracenoceras within the group, and the three other genera are all descended from the groups sister taxa. In 1927 the family Paracenoceratidae was named to house these four genera, and in 1956, the family was then downgraded to a subfamily within Nautilidae.

It stars Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon, who were making their first on-screen appearance together. A copy of this film survives in the Library of Congress.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress page 4, c. 1978 by The American Film Institute Lobby card Plot Marie is a jewel thief; posing as French maid, she has cased out the safe of her employer and intends to steal its contents. However, the night she chooses for the robbery, there is another thief who also shows up to empty the safe, Jimmy. Jimmy opens the safe, and the two agree to split the contents fifty- fifty. They are interrupted by the arrival of the police. Jimmy gallantly secretes Marie away, and takes the rap himself, impressing her. After serving his year's sentence, Jimmy is reunited with Marie, who now goes by the alias of Gertie, and the two form a partnership in crime. After several bank robberies, Marie and Jimmy agree that after one last haul, they will go straight. Marie, who has become friends with the next-door neighbors in her apartment building, Mr. and Mrs. Matson, who entice Jimmy to invest his $30,000 savings in Matson's business. Unfortunately, the Matsons turn out to be crooks themselves, and have swindled Jimmy out of his life's savings. When Jimmy determines to go back to safecracking, beginning with Marie's former employers, Marie hatches a plot to encourage him to go straight. When a good- hearted detective, Kelcey, lets them off the hook with the promise that they will go straight, they agree. Cast Reception The New York Times critic, Mordaunt Hall, gave the film a lukewarm review, praising the acting of Bebe Daniels, while not being as kind to Ben Lyon. Overall, he said the film, \\"... has not been handled with the subtlety and smoothness it deserves. Nevertheless, up to a certain point, it is a production that holds the interest, but what should have been the main idea is sacrificed for a more obvious turn of events.\\" Notes This is the first film in which Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon co-starred. They were married a short time afterwards, in June 1930, and the two remained married until her death in 1971. The play from which this screenplay was adapted, The Chatterbox, does not appear to have ever been produced. The film was a remake of the 1925 FBO silent film, Smooth as Satin, starring Evelyn Brent and Bruce Gordon, and directed by Ralph Ince.

The cemetery is situated on a hillside on the south-western edge of the village. History Buttenhausen, viewed from the path to the cemetery The Jewish community at Buttenhausen was established by Baron Phillip Friedrich von Liebenstein by a charter of 7 July 1797. Motivated by the desire to stimulate economic activity in the village, he invited twenty-five Jewish families to settle there under his protection. One of the privileges granted to the new community was the right to establish a cemetery above the new Jewish quarter. By 1870, Buttenhausen's Jewish residents numbered 442 in a total population of 800 and lived in 46 of the village's 100 houses. The oldest legible inscription in the cemetery dates from 1802; the last burials took place in 1943, shortly before the final deportations of Jews from the village. Today, 399 gravestones survive from the period of the cemetery‚Äôs use. Memorial stone at the Jewish Cemetery. Double- click the image for a translation of the inscription. A memorial stone near the entrance to the cemetery commemorates the now vanished Jewish community of Buttenhausen. Between 1940 and 1943 elderly Jews from the whole of the German Reich were forcibly sent to the so-called J√ºdisches Altersheim (\\"Jewish Retirement Home\\"), namely the vacated quarters of Buttenhausen‚Äôs Jews. From there, they were despatched to death camps. They are commemorated by a sculpture in the cemetery made from sections of railway track by the Swabian poet and singer-songwriter Thomas Felder. Memorial erected in 1966 on the site of the Buttenhausen synagogue, which was burnt down on the night of 9‚Äì10 November 1938 in the Kristallnacht. It stands next to the path leading to the cemetery The cemetery shows clearly the development of various gravestone forms and inscription styles from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 20th century. Whereas the oldest stones are simply decorated with Hebrew inscriptions, later ones are more impressively ornate and often indicate the geographical origin of the deceased. Since Jews were prevented from obtaining gravestones in the Nazi period, wooden stelae were erected on their graves (examples of which are now displayed in the town hall). They were replaced by simple gravestones n the 1960s. Preservation The cemetery‚Äôs remarkable state of preservation is largely the result of the efforts of Walter Ott. Born in Ulm in 1928, Ott became a resident of Buttenhausen after the Second World War where he worked on an agricultural estate. After coming across the abandoned cemetery in the course of chopping wood in 1946 he resolved to maintain the cemetery in good condition. In this, he was supported by former Jewish residents of Buttenhausen domiciled in the United States with whom he made contact after meeting Harry Lindauer (see external link) when the latter revisited his birthplace around 1960. In the 1970s Ott also discovered by chance a local archive of materials on the village's former Jewish inhabitants which enabled their history to be traced and encouraged further studies. In 1985 he was awarded the Federal Republic of Germany's highest civilian honour, the Bundesverdienstkreuz, in recognition of his efforts. In 2010, Ott received an Obermayer German Jewish History Award.

It was designed by David Adler in 1931 and is considered one of his most pure works as well as one of his largest. History Lester Armour was the son of Philip Danforth Armour, Jr., thus the son of meatpacking magnate Philip Danforth Armour, Sr. Lester Armour was born in 1895 and attended Yale University before joining Armour and Company, the family business. He married Leola Stanton in 1918; they had five children. In the early 1920s, he left the company to go into banking. He became president of the Chicago National Bank and was chairman of the board of Harris Bank. Armour later married Alexandra Galitzine, a Russian princess who was previously married to Prince Rostislav Alexandrovich of Russia. Architect David Adler was a friend of Leola Armour. She probably recommended that Lester commission Adler to design the house. Adler designed the house in 1931 and the Armours approved the plans with no requested changes. As a result, the house is almost exactly as Adler intended it, making it one of his purest houses. The style of the house was probably inspired from Adler's recent trip with Evelyn Marshall Field along the James and Potomac Rivers. The resulting Armour house exhibits influence from the Colonial and Federal styles, consistent with early Virginia architecture. The Armour house was one of the few that Adler designed in cooperation with his sister, interior designer Frances Adler Elkins. Lester Armour continued to live in the house following the divorce from Leola; in 1949 Alexandra Galitzine moved in. Lester Armour died in 1970. Alexandra continued to live in the house until 1977. That year, she rented the house out to Lionsgate Films to film the Robert Altman movie A Wedding, starring Desi Arnaz, Jr., Carol Burnett, and Mia Farrow. After filming, the estate, originally , was subdivided into fifteen lots of approximately . On May 3, 1984, the house was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

Gill grew up in Syracuse, New York and graduated from Syracuse University in 1911. He immediately moved to San Diego and went to work at his uncle's architectural firm as a draftsman, becoming chief draftsman by 1913. In 1914 his uncle took him on as a partner. Their partnership, known as Gill and Gill, Architects, lasted five years. As his uncle's associate, Louis contributed to the design of several notable buildings including La Jolla Woman's Club (now listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and the Ellen Browning Scripps residence at 700 Prospect Street (now the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego). Entrance to San Diego Zoo In 1919, he and his uncle dissolved their partnership and Louis struck out on his own. Louis had been taking on individual projects even before leaving the partnership. In 1916, the year of its founding, he was named to be the architect for the San Diego Zoo. He designed the original buildings and enclosures for the Zoo and remained on the Zoo's executive staff for more than 20 years, designing and remodeling multiple buildings and exhibits. In 1933, within hours of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, Gill traveled to the scene in his role as president of the California State Board of Architectural Examiners.

Predictive controllers rely on optimum control systems theory and aim to solve a cost functional minimization problem.Levine, W. S. ed. The Control Handbook, CRC/IEEE Press, Boca Raton, USA, 1996.M. Athans, Lecture Notes on Design of Robust Multivariable Feedback Control System, Prof. of Electrical Engineering, MIT, Visiting Research Emeritus Prof ISR/IST, Lisboa, 2004 Predictive controllers are relatively easy to numerically implement but electronic power converters are non-linear time varying dynamic systems, so a different approach to predictive must be taken. Principles of non-linear predictive optimum control The first step to design a predictive controller is to derive a detailed direct dynamic model (including non-linearities) of the switching power converter. This model must contain enough detail of the converter dynamics to allow, from initial conditions, a forecast in real time and with negligible error, of the future behavior of the converter. Sliding mode control of switching power converters chooses a vector to reach sliding mode as fast as possible (high switching frequency). It would be better to choose a vector to ensure zero error at the end of the sampling period Œît. To find such a vector, a previous calculation can be made (prediction); The converter has a finite number of vectors (states) and is usually non-linear: one way is to try all vectors to find the one that minimizes the control errors, prior to the application of that vector to the converter. Direct dynamics model based predictive control (DDMBPC) Direct Dynamics Predictive Control of Switching Power Converters Receding Horizon Optimum Predictive Control =The algorithm= # Obtain a dynamic model of the converter.

It provides long-term nursing, respite, dementia and end-of-life medical care for veterans of the British Armed Forces who have settled in Scotland. The charity also provides a range of individual and family accommodation and Veterans Activity Centres. The charity opened and established itself as Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers in 1916. Its name was then shortened to Erskine Hospital and then simply \\"Erskine\\" in later years. It was opened due to the need to treat the thousands of military personnel who lost their limbs in the First World War. The charity has gone on to offer help to British veterans of the First World War and every subsequent war. It has gone on to become the biggest ex-services facility in the country. History Artificial hands made for Erskine Hospital 1918, Hunterian Museum, Glasgow A need for a dedicated war hospital was apparent during the First World War, as hospitals were struggling to keep up with the demands of the many limbless soldiers and sailors returning from war. It was then thought that Scotland should have a large, modern war hospital to cope with these type of injuries. A charitable committee was formed after a meeting in Glasgow. Sir William Macewen, a chief surgeon, was at the forefront of pushing through the need for such a facility. He met with Sir Thomas Dunlop the Lord Provost of Glasgow, who was enthusiastic. The next stage was to find a location for the hospital in the west of Scotland. After reviewing several sites it was decided that Erskine would be the location. Thomas Aikman, the owner of Erskine House, which is a mansion on the banks of the River Clyde, offered free use of his mansion and gardens for the period of the war and for 12 years after it was declared over. Then Sir John Reid, a charity committee member, bought the mansion house and gardens and gifted them to the charity. Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll agreed to become the patron of the hospital and within a few weeks the Scottish public had donated ¬£100,000 towards the facility. The hospital was opened on 10 October 1916 and had an official opening on 6 June 1917 with Princess Louise making an appearance. Expansion Erskine's role has since expanded to meet the changing needs of war veterans. It now cares for any ex-service people and their spouses, who might be facing the challenges of long-term or degenerative health conditions. It also provides convalescent care for those recovering from illness - and provides hotel and support services for the Army's Personnel recovery Centre, at its Gilmerton Home in Edinburgh . By 1980, there were new departments available for ex- service people. These included a social work and speech therapy department. Erskine House, which was the original hospital building, needed extensive work to continue as a working hospital. The building was sold as part of the vision to modernize Erskine. It was then turned into a 5-star hotel called the Earl of Mar, later known as Mar Hall. It opened in 2004. The current CEO is Wing Commander Ian Cumming MBE. The CEO overseas Erskine as it enters a phase of expanding its services and insights - as a centre of excellence in Veterans Care & Support - more widely. =Erskine Home= In 2000-01, the charity moved to two new purpose built sites in the town of Erskine. The Erskine Home was opened in 2000. The new flagship building replaced the original hospital building and is situated on grounds by the Erskine Bridge. This centre cost ¬£16m and provides nursing and dementia care on a long term and respite basis. It has 180 beds available and is the biggest unit the charity has. Prince Charles, the charity's patron, opened the unit and unveiled a stone plaque to commemorate the opening. =Erskine Park Home= The Erskine Park Home opened in 2006. It offers care for 40 residents and specializes in dementia care. It is situated again within rural parkland by the Erskine Bridge. The Princess Royal has maintained her strong links with the charity and once again opened this Erskine based unit. =Erskine Edinburgh Home= The Erskine Edinburgh Home was opened in 2001. It is situated in Gilmerton and has capacity for 88 residents and additionally provides hotel accommodation and support to younger Service people passing through the Personnel Recovery Centre . This was the charity's first unit outside the Erskine area. This was also opened by the Princess Royal. =Erskine Glasgow Home= The Erskine Glasgow Home was opened by the Princess Royal in 2007. It is situated in Anniesland and has space for 46 residents. It also has partnership arrangements with care homes in Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness. =Veterans' Accommodation= Erskine has also rebuilt 50 veterans' cottages within the old hospital grounds at Erskine to house ex-service members and their families. It recently completed building 5 assisted living apartments for elderly veterans who seek to remain independent but close to expert staff. Erskine is also building a 24 apartment complex for younger Veterans without a home =Reid Macewen Centre= This unit was first opened as a training and conference facility. It now offers \\"psychosocial support\\", recreational and community activities for Veteran on the West Coast who are struggling with social isolation and loneliness. It is housed within the historic stable building at the charity's HQ within the Bishopton Estate. It is jointly named after Sir John Reid, who gifted the mansion and gardens to the charity, and Sir William Macewen, the surgeon who pushed through the need for the hospital. As the building is Category B listed, the charity collaborated with Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund on the renovation. It was officially opened in June 2001 by Wendy Alexander MSP. Erskine intends to replicate centres like these in Central Scotland, Inverness, Aberdeenshire, Fife & Tayside. Funding Erskine is first and foremost a charity. Local Authorities make a contribution to its operating costs of caring for their elderly citizens. However, Erskine must fundraise around ¬£12M a year, to achieve the outstanding levels of care, support and meaningful community activities, which the charity believes Veterans deserve. Fundraising schemes are active throughout the year and in 2017, Erskine was rated as Scotland's most effective fundraising charity by Civil Society Magazine. The charity hosts many events including an annual motorbike meet and classic car show. Veterans also partake in various woodwork and craft activities with daily activities taking place in the Bunker. The charity will accept the help of volunteers from the public. Artificial limbs There was a huge influx of injured military personnel returning from the First World War with missing limbs due to the fighting. Britain at this time was wholly dependent on foreign imports of artificial limbs. Sir William Macewan, the chief surgeon at the hospital, thought that this was intolerable. A dispensary and operating theatre were fitted out as workshops making artificial limbs. Mcewan also enlisted the help of a local shipbuilding company called Yarrow Shipbuilders. The company not only lent their yard but chose to have some of their best craftsmen working on the design and construction of the limbs. McEwan and Yarrows subsequently designed a new concept artificial limb known as the Erskine Artificial Limb. By December 1917 the hospital had treated 1,613 patients and of that number 1,126 required a new limb. And by 1920, there had been 9,500 artificial limbs fitted. Most of these were manufactured at the hospital‚Äôs workshops. Listed buildings The original hospital building is called Erskine House and is a Category A listed building.

Originally planned to carry out the assembly in Mendeleevsk and Shuya. FSV, a British company that released the Rickman Ranger car with rear wheel drive and the frame structure, was selected as a foreign partner. According to the agreement, the 70% of the car company is sent to FSV. In the future, it was planned to fully localize the assembly. Autokam Ranger/2160 short wheelbase version Autokam 2160 long wheelbase version 27 May 1991, Mendeleevsk opened production, but a lot of hope in Shuya factory, has more power. In the same year it began production of cars called Avtokam Ranger. In 1992, the cars were renamed Avtokam-2160. Before the year ended, 48 cars were collected in Mendeleevsk and Shuya, and 2 cars in Stakhanov, Ukraine. The partnership with FSV ended. She did not put another 950 kits and its leadership has disappeared. Between plants and any contradictions, production was discontinued, and had to find new ones. Between plants and any contradictions, production was discontinued in Shuya. At this time, the imported parts were replaced by Russian.

In the U.S., he is mostly known for his work for Marvel Comics in the mid‚Äì1970s. Career Trinidad began his professional career as an assistant for the \\"Dean of Philippine comics,\\" Francisco Coching, and Trinidad's style bore a similarity to Choching's. Trinidad's first professional credits included illustrating novelist Marcial Buanno‚Äôs Guido Mortal and Arkong Bato in the late 1960s. Trinidad co-created the Filipino superheroes El Gato (with writer Mike Tan) and Inday sa Balitaw (with writer Pablo S. Gomez). Along with a number of other Filipino comics creators in the 1970s, Trinidad found work in the American comics industry, initially for DC Comics on such titles as The Witching Hour, House of Mystery, The Unexpected, and Weird Western Tales. It was in the U.S. that he began using the pen name \\"Sonny\\" Trinidad. When he moved to Marvel Comics in 1974, he was given the moniker \\"Slammin' Sonny Trinidad\\" in the \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\".\\"Bullpen Bulletins\\" Marvel Comics cover- dated December 1974. Trinidad supplied full art or inks over other artists (frequently John Romita Sr. and John Buscema) on horror titles such as Vampire Tales (Morbius the Living Vampire stories written by Doug Moench), Dracula Lives!, Marvel Chillers, and The Son of Satan, as well as fantasy and adventure titles like Skull the Slayer, The Savage Sword of Conan, and Deadly Hands of Kung Fu. Other highlights of Trinidad's tenure at Marvel included \\"Hellfire Helix Hex!,\\" written by John Warner, for Marvel Presents #2 (Dec. 1975); in addition, Trinidad inked the feature story (written by Bill Mantlo and penciled by Tom Sutton) in Man From Atlantis #1 (Feb. 1978). Trinidad was often hired to do adaptations. One of his biggest commissions was the black- and-white magazine one-shot Marvel Movie Premiere, which featured his and writer Marv Wolfman's adaptation of the 1975 movie The Land That Time Forgot. With writer Roy Thomas and penciler John Buscema, Trinidad adapted Robert E. Howard's \\"The Pool of the Black One\\" in Savage Sword of Conan #22‚Äì23 (Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1977). And with writer Doug Moench, Trinidad adapted H. G. Wells' The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth for Marvel Classics Comics #22 (1977). By around 1990, Trinidad had returned to the world of Filipino komiks, with contributions to the horror comic book Holiday (a.k.a. Zuriga). In 1995, Trinidad supplied painted covers for the short-lived series Lastikman Komiks. Trinidad was diagnosed with cancer in December 2008 and died about a year later. He was survived by his wife, Natalia; daughters, Nacel and Cherry; and son, Norman.

It originated in 1231 as a division of the order of Teutonic Knights. During the Protestant Reformation most of the members became Protestant, mainly Reformed or Lutheran. The Bailiwick cut its ties with the order based in the Holy Roman Empire and placed itself under the protection of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. The order was briefly suppressed during the Napoleonic era, but revived in 1815 after the restoration of the House of Orange. In 1995 it returned to the Duitse Huis (Teutonic House) as its headquarters, a building that dates from 1348. Foundation The Teutonic Order originated in 1190 during the siege of Acre in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade. At first the mission was to nurse the sick and wounded crusaders. In 1198 a military element was added. The mission was to fight the enemies of Christendom, particularly in the Holy Land, and to protect pilgrims to the holy land. The statutes of the order were confirmed by Pope Innocent III in a bull of 19 February 1199. The Teutonic Order was particularly active in the Baltic region. However, it had many branches in the west to provide sources of funds and of recruits. As with other religious institutions, the order depended on donations of land and buildings from princes and private individuals. The income could then support the troops. The order soon established an organization throughout the German Empire of bailiwicks headed by a land commander reporting to the German master. Below the land commander were commanders, who administered the order's property. The Teutonic Order was given property in the Netherlands in 1218‚Äì19 by Count Adolf van den Berg and Sweder van Dingede. The master of the order held the property at first. The Bailiwick of Utrecht was established in 1231 when a donation was made of a house with land at the Tolsteegsingel, outside Utrecht in the location of the present University Hospital. In 1232 a commander's house had been built and Antonius van Printhagen, known as \\"Lederzak\\" (leatherbag) was named commander of Utrecht. This became the headquarters of all the property of the Teutonic order in the diocese of Utrecht, Holland, Zeeland, Friesland and Gelderland. Early years Johan van Hoenhorst, land commander 1325‚Äì40 The Teutonic Order's Bailiwick of Utrecht (Balije van Utrecht) initially focused mainly on the spiritual development of its own members. The knights and priests took the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The Bailiwick of Utrecht soon owned several estates and churches. These included the church of Hofdijk, later Maasland (1241), St. Nicholas Church in Utrecht (1250), Leiden (1268), Schoneveld in Rhenen (1270), the Church of Valkenburg in Katwijk (1388) and so on. Commanderies were founded to manage these properties, and over time these came to include the commanderies of Dieren, Schelluinen, Maasland, Schoten, Middelburg, Tiel, Leiden, Doesburg, Nes (Friesland), Valkenburg, Bunne (Drenthe), Schoonhoven, Rhenen and Katwijk. There were convents of priest brethren at Nes, Rhenen and Tiel. The smaller houses also owned large areas of land, and were run by commanders. The head of a commandery was usually a knight but was sometimes a priest brother. The knight brethren were nobles. The land commander was always a knight, and most of the commanders were also knights. A knight brother had to have no physical defects, and be of legitimate birth with four noble grandparents. He gave a vow of chastity and obedience. Once admitted after an elaborate ceremony he could not leave the order. The order was not a religious one, since its goals were mainly nursing the sick and fighting the enemies of Christendom, but religious worship played a large role in the community's life. A convent or main house of a Bailiwick should consist of a commander and twelve brothers, recalling Jesus and his disciples. Thus in the 15th century the Duitse Huis had five knight brothers and eight priest brothers. In 1345 Count William IV of Holland, who was engaged in a struggle with the bishop of Utrecht, laid siege to Utrecht. After the siege the land commander decided to move his headquarters into the city for safety reasons. He bought some land with four houses on the Springweg for this purpose. Construction began in May 1347, and by 1358 the headquarters house and a large church were complete. The Duitse Huis lay between the city wall and Springweg. In the main Duitse Huis in addition to the knights and priests there were staff who assisted in church services and helped run the house and manage the bailiwick. These included the treasurer, clerks, storekeeper and other administrative staff, as well as builders and craftsmen, and servants such as the baker, brewer, dishwasher and barber. The Duitse Huis had a large household for which a well-coordinated organization was essential. The Bailiwick's expenses were covered by the return from assets, mostly farmland, which could not be alienated or encumbered without the assent of the general chapter of the order. As long as regular donations were received, the system was workable. With political strife, it began to fall apart. In 1520 there was a financial crisis when the general chapter demanded more money, and the land commanders of Utrecht, Alden Biezen, Westphalia and Lorraine jointly protested. They organized another protest in 1529 when the general chapter in Frankfurt asked for a further financial sacrifice. The Guelderian Wars caused much damage by both sides to the bailiwick's possessions, and the bailiwick had to supply 20 land knights to Vienna to help in the fight against the Turks, at considerable expense. In 1525 Albert of Brandenberg, grand master of the Teutonic Order, adopted Lutheranism and was made hereditary duke of Prussia by Sigismund I, king of Poland. After the loss of Prussia the Grand Magistery of the Order was transferred to Mergentheim. Sometimes the Duitse Huis was the place of pomp and ceremony. In 1545 the Emperor Charles V and his sister Mary of Hungary made the house their residence on the occasion of a meeting of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In 1570 the administrator of the order's high master was housed there when he accompanied the Anne of Austria to Spain as bride of Philip II. Although technically bound to celibacy, the knights did not take this vow very seriously. Albert van Egmond van Meresteyn, land commander in 1536‚Äì60, kept a mistress in a cottage in the Teutonic House grounds and apparently legitimized her daughter in 1549. His successor Frans van Loo, land commander in 1560‚Äì79, also paid no attention to this vow. Frans van Loo and his coadjutor Jasper van Egmond were both assumed to have Protestant sympathies. Transitional period Jacob Taets van Amerongen, land commander in 1579‚Äì1612 The Union of Utrecht was signed on 23 January 1579 in Utrecht by Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Groningen. In the months that followed the other Protestant territories and cities of the Netherlands joined the union. In 1580 the States of Utrecht began to demand that Catholic institutions such as the Bailiwick be dissolved and their goods used for charity. The Catholic land commander in 1579‚Äì1612, Jacob Taets van Amerongen, resisted on the basis that the goods \\"belonged to our Lord the German Master\\", and that the Bailiwick was a knightly institution that served \\"where necessary to fight with weapons for the defense of the Empire against our common arch enemy, the Turk...\\" A struggle ensued with the States of Utrecht, which finally allowed the order to continue to exist on condition that they completely break with the Teutonic Order in Germany. The States of Utrecht would appoint the land commander, coadjutor and commanders. Assets could not be sold without the consent of the States and the order had to contribute to the costs of maintenance and preservation of the reformed worship. Although forced to accept these terms, Taets van Amerongen was an ardent supporter of the Catholic faith and throughout his life considered that he was subordinate to the German master and the Archduke of Austria. Taets van Amerongen died on 4 December 1612. On 18 December 1612 the commanders were ordered to provide a detailed account of their goods, rents and mortgages. The investigation showed that the Bailiwick had serious problems and had to adopt drastic measures. Dieren and Tiel were heavily indebted, and some property had to be sold. On 8 June 1615, when the chapter asked for permission to appoint a coadjutor, the States determined that offices, prebends and so on could only be given to followers of the reformed religion. The decisive moment in the transition may have occurred when Jasper van Lynden took office in 1619, since he was the first Protestant land commander. At almost the same time, Hendrik Casimir van Nassau-Dietz was appointed coadjutor of the order, at the age of seven. A new regulation was adopted in 1619 allowing the land commander, coadjutor and commanders to marry, but they had to leave the order and had no claim to their property. By a resolution of 13 November 1637 the ban on marriage was withdrawn, and this was approved by the States on 5 May 1640, so married members could remain with the Bailiwick. Protestant order In 1637 the knights formally accepted the protection of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. They remained an order of Teutonic Knights, but were no longer Catholic. The land commander and commanders decided on admission to the order. Candidates had to provide their certificate of baptism and had to belong to the reformed church. After paying their fees, they became knights expectant, and had to wait for a vacancy among the commanders. The Bailiwick gradually lost property. The house in Dieren was destroyed by soldiers in 1629 and had to be rebuilt. The new house and its estate were sold to the Prince of Orange. In 1657 the town of Doesburg took over the commander's house for use as an orphanage. The order lost the church of Katwijk in 1674. Buildings that were too expensive to maintain were demolished in Tiel (1682), Maasland (1721), Leiden (1730), Middelburg (1740) and Schoonhoven (1740). By now the commanders generally did not live in their commanderies, and did not exercise effective financial control. At a meeting on 23 September 1760 a general steward was appointed to take over all financial administration. The commanders now became purely title holders, receiving a salary determined by the rank and importance of the commandery. The general steward received a salary of 6% of total revenues, plus fixed fees for managing the finances and maintaining the house in Utrecht. Use of this house for banquets, balls and concerts was forbidden. The land commander and the priestly brothers, knights and staff remained at the Duitse Huis until 1807, when the property was sold to King Louis for 50,000 guilders. They then moved to a house in the Hague, taking their records with them. On 27 February 1811 the Teutonic Order was abolished by the French in the Kingdom of Holland and its estates were confiscated. The land commander Baron Bentinck asked the French for time to arrange for the settlement, and managed to greatly delay the process. A book published in 1812, slightly out of date, said the bailiwick of Utrecht still had ten commanderies: Dieren, Veluve, Tiel, Maasland, Rheenen, Leyden, Schoten,.Doesburg, Schelluinen, Middelburg and Schoonhoven. After the fall of Napoleon and the restoration of the House of Orange, on 8 August 1815 the Bailiwick was revived by royal decree of William I of the Netherlands. The membership was restricted to Lutheran noblemen with sixteen noble quarterings. In recent years this restriction has been relaxed, but members must still have four noble grandparents, and the families of the paternal and maternal lines must both date to before 1795. In December 1836 the seat of the order was moved back to Utrecht. In 1995 the Teutonic Order moved back into the 15th century Commander's house on the corner of Springweg and Walsteeg. Today the order is engaged in charitable work, an echo of its original mission which also combined ministering to the sick with combating the infidel.

Law in India primarily evolved from customary practices and religious prescription to the modern well codified acts and laws based on a constitution. Though the recorded history of law starts only in the Vedic period, it is widely believed that ancient India had some sort of legal system in place even during the Bronze Age and the Indus Valley civilization.http://www.cbseacademic.in/web_material/doc/Legal_Studies/XI_U3_Legal_Studies.pdf The various stages of evolution of Indian law is classified as that during the Vedic period, the Islamic period, the British period and post independence. Vedic period In comparison with modern law, the classical Hindu law was a peculiar legal system as it followed a unique arrangement of law and polity with a unique scheme of values. Ancient India represented a distinct tradition of law, and had a historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The main aim of the law in the Vedic period was to preserve \\"dharma\\" which means righteousness and duty.The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Dharma Dharma consists of both legal duties and religious duties. It not only includes laws and court procedures, but also a wide range of human activities like ritual purification, personal hygiene regimes, and modes of dress. Dharma provided the principal guidance by which one endeavored to lead his life. =Sources of classical Hindu law= The sources of law during this period were Sruti, Smriti and acharas (customs). Sruti consist of the 4 Vedas namely Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda. These Vedas chiefly dealt with religious duties, practices and customs. The second source is called Smriti, which literally means 'as remembered' and refers to tradition. They are the humanly authored written texts that contain the collected traditions. Some of the most prominent Smriti are Dharmashastras which includes Manusmriti (200BC-200CE); Yajnavalkya Smriti (200-500CE); Naradasmriti (100BC- 400CE); Visnusmriti (700-1000CE); Brhaspatismriti (200-400CE); and Katyayanasmriti (300-600CE). These texts were often used for legal judgments and opinion. They dealt with the subject matter of dharma and were guidebooks on dharma with rules of conduct and rites. Dharmasutra (the first four texts of the Dharmashastra) discuss the rules for duties for all the ashrama: the student- hood, the house holdership, the retirement or forest dwelling, and renunciation. Also, they provide the rites and duties of kings and court proceedings. Other issues that are Dharmasutras cover include rules about one's diet, crimes and punishments, daily sacrifices, and funeral practices. Dharmashastra contains three categories or topics. The first is the √¢ch√¢ra, which provides rules on daily rituals, life-cycle rites, as well as specific duties and proper conduct that each of the four castes or varnas have to follow. The daily rituals include practices about daily sacrifices, the kind of food to eat and how to obtain them, and who can give and who can accept religious gifts. The life-cycle rites are the rituals that are conducted on important events in one's life like birth, marriage, and tying of the sacred thread. Acharas also provide rules for duties for all the ashrama. Ashrama are the four stages of life that include: Brahmacharya (the student life), Grihastha (the householder), Vanaprastha (the forest dweller), and Sanyasa (the renouncer). The second topic enumerated in the Dharmashastra is the 'vyav√¢hara'. Vyavahara are laws and legal procedures. They include the'rajadharma' or the duties and obligations of a king to organize court, listen and examine witnesses, decide and enforce punishment and pursue justice. The third category is called the 'pr√¢yaschitta', which lays down rules for punishments and penances for violating the laws of dharma. They are understood to remove the sin of committing something that is forbidden. During the Vedic period the legal procedures including that of filing case were called vyavahara. The equivalent of modern plaint was called \\"purvapaksha\\", and that of written statement as \\"uttar\\". The trial was called \\"kriya\\" and verdict as \\"nirnaya\\". The profession of lawyers or advocates were unknown during this period. Trial by jury and trial by ordeal were the two types of trials that existed during the period. According to J. Rama Jois the ancient Indian and constitutional system had established a duty based society.Rama Jois , Seeds of Modern Public Law in Ancient Indian Jurisprudence (1990 En, Eastern Book Company) pp. 1-2. It postulated that everybody from the king to the lowest of society is bound to fulfil his/her duty towards the society. This was same for the whole of India, notwithstanding the existence of larger and smaller kingdoms and the supremacy of Dharma (law) over the kings as declared in the authoritative texts was respected in letter and spirits/B.M. Gandhi, Landmarks in Indian Legal and Constitutional History, page 6 Thus there were no absolute monarchies. The Dharmasastras asked the kings to look upon the people as God (Praja Vishnu) and serve them with love and reverence. The doctrine of \\"king can do no wrong\\" was not accepted and the king himself was subjected to law.P.V. Kane, History of Dharmasastra, Vol.III, p.25 Quoted by Rama Jois Administration of Justice During Vedic Period In ancient India, Naman was regarded as the fountain of justice has to act as the lord of Dharma and was entrusted with the supreme authority of the administration of justice and his foremost duty was to protect the rights of his subject. The King's Court was the highest court, next to which came the court of the Chief Justice (Pradvivaka). The King's Court was the highest court of appeal as well as an original court in cases of vital importance to the state. In the King's Court the King was advised by learned people like Learned Brahmins, the ministers, the Chief Justice etc. As mentioned by Brihaspati, there were four kinds of tribunals, namely, stationary, movable courts held under the royal signet in the absence of the King, and commissions under the King's presidency. So there was hierarchy of courts. In villages, the village councils (Kulani) dealt with simple civil and criminal cases. At a higher level in towns and districts the courts were presided over by government officers under the authority of the King to administer justice. In order to deal with problems among members of artisanal class, traders etc. trade guilds were authorised to exercise an effective jurisdiction over their members. Family courts were also established. Puga assemblies made up of groups of families in the same village decided civil disputes amongst family members. Minor criminal cases were dealt with by judicial assemblies in villages whereas criminal cases of a serious nature were presented before the central court usually held under the King or royal authority. The appeal system was practised and the King was the highest body of appeal. One significant feature of the ancient Indian legal system was the absence of lawyers. P.V. Kane, History of Dharmasastra, Vol. III, Chap. XI, 288-289 Another notable feature was that a bench of two or more judges was always preferred to administer justice rather than a single individual being the sole administrator of justice. K.P.

The need for such codes is reflected in the saying, \\"Earthquakes don't kill people--buildings do.\\" Or in expanded version, ‚ÄúEarthquakes do not injure or kill people. Poorly built manmade structures injure and kill people.‚Äù Seismic codes were created and developed as a response to major earthquakes which have caused devastation in highly populated regions. Often these are revised based on knowledge gained from recent earthquakes and research findings, and as such they are constantly evolving. There are many seismic codes used worldwide. Most codes at their root share common fundamental approaches regarding how to design buildings for earthquake effects, but will differ in their technical requirements and will have language addressing local geologic conditions, common construction types, historic issues, etc. Origin The 1755 Lisbon earthquake (Portugal) resulted in prescriptive rules for building certain kinds of buildings common in the area. Following the 1908 Messina earthquake (Italy) the Royal Government of Italy established Geological Committee and Engineering Committee in early 1909 to study the disaster and recommend earthquake disaster mitigation measures. The Engineering Committee, after studying the lateral load resistance of buildings which survived the earthquake motion, recommended that the seismic ratio (seismic acceleration divided by the gravity acceleration) equal to 1/12 for the first floor and 1/8 for the floors above should be used in seismic design of buildings. The Committee proposed equivalent vertical forces much larger than the horizontal forces because vertical motion acted as impacts. This is believed to be the first known quantitative recommendation of design seismic forces in the history of seismic codes. The recommendation was adopted in Royal Decree No. 573 of April 29, 1915. The height of the buildings was limited to two stories, and the first story should be designed for a horizontal force equal to 1/8 the second floor weight and the second story for 1/6 of the roof weight. The 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake (Japan) and earlier events inspired Japanese engineer Toshikata Sano to develop a lateral force procedure that was officially implemented in the 1924 Japanese Urban Building Law, which directed engineers to design buildings for horizontal forces of about 10% of the weight of the building. In 1925, the city of Santa Barbara, California, added a building code requirement that structures be designed to withstand horizontal forces, but was nonspecific regarding design loads or procedure. This is considered to be the Ô¨Årst explicit policy and legal consideration of the seismic safety of structures in the U.S. The city of Palo Alto, California, led by professors at Stanford, also added similar language to its building code in 1926. In January 1928, the first edition of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) was published, and included an appendix with non-mandatory matter with ¬ß2311 recommending a minimum lateral design force for earthquake resistance of V = 0.075W for buildings on foundations with allowable bearing pressures of 4,000 psf or more, and 0.10 W for all other buildings including those on pile foundations. Building weight (seismic mass) was defined as: W = Dead load + Live load. These provisions were inspired by Japan's newly developed seismic code. The non-mandatory lateral design provisions are not known to have been explicitly adopted by any jurisdiction at the time, but may have been used voluntarily for the design of some buildings. In response to the 1933 Long Beach earthquake (California) the city of Los Angeles adopted the first earthquake design provisions enforced in the U.S., enacted by City Council under Ordinance No. 72,968 published September 6, 1933. The requirements included a design lateral base shear V = 0.08 W for regular use buildings, 0.10 W for school buildings and 0.04 W for the portion of a building above a flexible story. Building weight (seismic mass) was defined as W = Dead load + 0.5 Live load (except 1.0 Live for warehouses). Building frames were required to be designed to withstand at least 0.25V independent of any walls. Immediately after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, careful analysis of structural failures in that quake by architect Louis John Gill formed the basis for much of the California seismic legislation (Field Act for schools and Riley Act for all buildings).PEER (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley) Tall Buildings Initiative‚ÄîTask 2 Workshop April 18, 2007Rev.

In February 2004 a new set of seismic codes was issued.\\"SEISMIC DESIGN AND CODES IN MEXICO\\", Mario ORDAZ and Roberto MELIZ, 13th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering Vancouver, B.C., Canada, August 1-6, 2004, Paper No. 4000 =Spain= In Spain the seismic code is called the \\"Norma de Construcci√≥n Sismorresistente\\".

He was most well known as the \\"Voice of Jazzfest\\", co-founder of Minit Records, and the host of several shows on the New Orleans radio stations WNNR- AM and WMRY-FM (now known as WYLD (AM)). Early life McKinley was born on December 13, 1927, in Chicago, Illinois. He spent his early years in the Chicago area and went on to study at Roosevelt University. While studying there in September 1954, he received an internship with the radio station WMRY-FM in New Orleans. He decided to settle there permanently after he covered a speech by Martin Luther King, after which he was quoted having said \\"I can't go back I feel like I'm being a part of history here\\". Career In 1959 McKinley's success in hosting the radio station WMRY-FM led to a close friendship with a local businessman named Joe Banashak. Together the two each invested $650 to found a record label called Minit Records. The name came to Banashak when he drove by a restaurant called \\"Meal a Minit\\". McKinley, who was also promoting local artists, eventually signed Allen Toussaint as the producer for the label. The production efforts of Toussaint earned the label a #1 spot on the national pop and R&B; charts through Ernie K-Doe's 1961 hit Mother-in-Law. McKinley went on to briefly own one third of the record label Instant Records but dropped out for reasons that are not entirely clear. After leaving the record label business for good McKinley went back to radio, hosting the popular local radio show \\"The Frank and Larry Show\\". McKinley also went on to join the governing board of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation, Inc, the proprietor of what is colloquially known as Jazzfest, a New Orleans-based annual music festival. He left the governing board in order to record the voice-overs for the festival. His voice, often described as a baritone, became a mainstay of the festival and is still used today. McKinley also presided over the annual festival gala as the master of ceremonies. Awards For his work in the music industry McKinley won several award over the years. In 1989 McKinley was inducted into the AFTRA Hall of Fame for his work in the radio industry. In 2005 OffBeat magazine awarded McKinley their \\"Best of the Beat Music Business Award\\" for his contributions to the music business industry. Five years later McKinley was inducted into the prestigious Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Death McKinley died on December 8, 2013, from complications due to COPD. He was buried on December 16, 2013.

She was educated in England and spent most of her recent career in Switzerland. She is currently the rector of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, also known as ETH Zurich.  Early life, education and family  Born in 1956 in London, Springman was educated at Wycombe Abbey, where she was later a governor from 1993 to 1996. She studied engineering sciences at Cambridge University (Bachelor level) from 1975 to 1978 and returned for a MPhil in soil mechanics in 1983 and carried on her doctoral research in soil-structure interaction, earning her doctorate between 1984 to 1989. She worked as an engineer on geotechnical projects in England, Australia and Fiji (primarily on the Monasavu Dam in Viti Levu), from 1979 to 1983 and became a chartered engineer and Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1983.  Sporting career  In addition to being a civil engineer, she represented Great Britain at the elite level in triathlon from 1983 to 1993, competing in the 1990 Commonwealth Games Triathlon in Auckland, New Zealand and winning twenty elite European Triathlon Union (ETU) Championship medals in triathlon and duathlon. Springman served as Vice- President of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) from 1992 to 1996, during which time, she played an important role in getting triathlon into the Olympics. She stepped down as President of British Triathlon on 31 December 2012 after celebrating Team GB's first triathlon medals won at an Olympic Games and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Sunday Times and Sky Sports Sportswomen of the Year Awards in London in 2013. She has again served as ITU's Vice-President since 2008 and is a member of the International Olympic Committee's Sustainability and Legacy Commission. On 18 August 2016, she was chosen as a presentation official at the Olympic triathlon medal ceremony, at which brothers Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee received gold and silver medals for Team GB in Rio de Janeiro. The International Triathlon Union named her to their Hall of Fame in 2019.  Academic career  Springman has been professor of geotechnical engineering at ETH Z√ºrich since 1997, and the Deputy Head of the Institute for Geotechnical Engineering since 2007. She became Rector of ETH Z√ºrich on 1 January 2015. The emphasis of Springman's research is on geotechnical modelling of soil structure interaction problems. Including design and construction of abutments, pile foundations, reinforced soil and oil drilling structures, Springman combines physical modelling in a geotechnical centrifuge with numerical modelling so that the data may be used to develop, calibrate or validate new design methods. At ETH Z√ºrich her group uses a drum geotechnical centrifuge to carry out practical studies on a range of geotechnical problems. Springman advocates for access for women to STEM / MINT studies and engages in many events and campaigns to support this.

Its facility originated with a $360,000 gift to the Mamaroneck Free Library by Emelin in memory of his father, Emanuel Joseph Emelin. The structure of the current theater was built in 1984. In 2013, the Emelin‚Äôs lobby underwent a $250,000 renovation to make it more modern and accessible. The New Rochelle-based architecture firm Stoll & Stoll donated their services to the Emelin, which paid no fees for the design of the new facility. The Emelin Theatre upgraded film capabilities to a DCP projection system in 2016.  Events and activities  It hosts music series devoted to rock, folk, classical, jazz, tribute bands, and traditional musical forms from multiple traditions. Its five-time IBMA nominated bluegrass series has existed since 1982. It also features theater, dance, comedy, family films, and a subscription-only film series. Approximately one-third of its programming is family-oriented, and since 1997 its subsidized School Outreach Program has brought children from Westchester County schools to the Emelin for educational programming. The Emelin has assisted listening devices available, and accessible seating is located in the first four rows of the theatre. It currently hosts between 80 and 100 performances per year, with a combined attendance of approximately 30,000.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. A companion bill, , was introduced into the United States Senate. There is no record in this article that the proposed bill ever became US Federal statutory law. Background Newborn screening programs test for a number of different conditions using a number of different laboratorial methodologies. There is also bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder, starting with phenylketonuria in the early 1960s. With this testing methodology, newborn screening required one test to detect one condition. As mass spectrometry became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot. This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening. Enzyme assays are used to screen for galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency. Immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency. The first newborn screening law, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 (), was passed in 2008. The law established national standards for newborn screenings. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014 would amend the Public Health Service Act to extend and revise a grant program for screening, counseling, and other services related to heritable disorders. The bill would expand eligible grantees to include a health professional organization and an early childhood health system. The bill would extend a grant program to evaluate the effectiveness of screening, counseling, or health care services in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by heritable disorders in newborns and children. Expands the program to include evaluation of treatment and follow-up care for newborns and their families after screening and diagnosis. The bill would extend for five years the operation of the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. Authorizes the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to continue the Advisory Committee after such time. Requires the Advisory Committee to meet in person at least twice each year. The bill would extend the clearinghouse for newborn screening information. Expands the duties of the clearinghouse to include: (1) maintaining current data on the number of conditions for which screening is conducted in each state; and (2) establishing or disseminating guidelines for services and personnel necessary for follow-up, diagnosis, counseling, and treatment of to conditions detected by newborn screening. The bill would extend requirements for the Secretary to provide for quality assurance of laboratories involved in screening newborns and children for heritable disorders. The bill would extend the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Newborn and Child Screening. The bill would authorize the Secretary to have the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program to: (1) provide research and data for newborn conditions under review by the Advisory Committee to be added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel; and (2) conduct pilot studies on conditions recommended by the Advisory Committee to ensure that screenings are ready for nationwide implementation. The bill would direct the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award grants to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, eligible entities to develop longitudinal follow-up and tracking programs for newborn screening. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 3, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1281 would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders. Authority to operate those programs expired at the end of fiscal year 2013. However, the Congress appropriated funds for fiscal year 2014 to continue the programs in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 1281 would cost $80 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. H.R. 1281 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 1281 contains no intergovernmental or private- sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 20, 2013 by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D, CA-40). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. The bill was reported (amended) on June 19, 2014 alongside House Report 113-478. Debate and discussion The March of Dimes encouraged its supporters to \\"tell Congress that you support\\" the bill. The March of Dimes described the bill as reauthorizing \\"critical federal activities that assist states in improving and expanding their newborn screening programs, supporting parents and provider newborns screening education, and ensuring laboratory quality and surveillance.\\" The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) supported the bill, arguing that \\"many of the drug therapies currently under development for MDA's community will be of most benefit if administered either presymptomatically or early in the progression of the disease. Thus, for some of the diseases in MDA's program, the availability of a newborn screening program at the time of treatment availability presents the best opportunity for impacting optimal and potential lifesaving treatment outcomes.\\" Rep. Roybal-Allard, who introduced the bill, argued that \\"newborn screening not only transforms and save lives - it saves money.\\" According to Roybal-Allard, in California \\"newborns are screened for more than 40 preventable and treatable conditions ‚Äì and for every one dollar California spends on screening, it yields a benefit of over $9 as we prevent disease in children who are diagnosed with these treatable conditions.\\" Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID), who cosponsored the bill, said that \\"the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborn‚Äôs foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives.\\" The National Association of Neonatal Nurses also supported the bill.

It is based on V. C. Andrews‚Äô 1980 novel of the same name, the second novel on the Dollanganger series. The film follows the surviving Dollanganger children‚ÄîCathy, Chris and Carrie‚Äîten years after escaping the attic. Despite attempting to move on with their lives, after multiple failed attempts and tragedies occur, Cathy decides it's time to take revenge on her mother. Lifetime first announced the film shortly before Flowers in the Attic was released. The network announced on the premiere of the movie the developing of the following books of the Dollanganger series, If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday, both of which aired in 2015. The film received a positive response from critics. Plot Ten years after escaping from Foxworth Hall, the surviving Dollanganger children‚ÄîCathy, Chris, and Carrie‚Äîattend the funeral of their adoptive father, Paul Sheffield, who took them in. They are still traumatized by their grandmother's abuse and their mother's betrayal, which led to the death of Carrie's twin, Cory. Meanwhile, their grandmother, Olivia, is an invalid after having suffered a stroke a couple of years prior. Corrine has avoided all contact with her children and begins to renovate Foxworth Hall so she can take full ownership of the mansion. Cathy has become an aspiring ballet dancer, Chris is in medical school, and Carrie is enrolled in an elite high school, but is constantly bullied for her small size. Cathy meets and is attracted to Julian Marquet, a fellow dancer. On their first date, he invites her to go to New York with him to try for a leading role in Romeo and Juliet, which she accepts. Later that night, Cathy and Chris admit that they still have feelings for each other and give in to their passion, making love. However, Cathy insists they must find others to love and live normal lives. The conversation reveals that Cathy was pregnant with Chris' child, conceived from their first sexual encounter while they were imprisoned, but miscarried. Although Chris says he can never love anyone but her, Cathy leaves for New York with Julian the next day with hopes of starting afresh with him. Chris begins a relationship with Sarah Reeves, the daughter of his boss at the hospital where he works. Cathy's relationship with Julian quickly deteriorates as he shows a dark and abusive side. When she attempts to leave, Julian threatens to kill her and Chris. He drops her during ballet try-outs and injures her leg, ruining her chance of getting her desired role. She manages to sneak away to see Chris graduate from medical school but denies anything is wrong when he sees her black eye. Cathy returns to Julian after he shows regret for having abused her and helps her get the role of Juliet by putting broken glass in the original dancer's shoes. Cathy agrees to let Carrie stay with her and Julian to escape the relentless bullying at school. During the ballet, Chris catches Julian touching Carrie and a violent confrontation ensues. Julian drives off and Cathy goes with him. Cathy reveals she is pregnant with Julian's child, which causes an already erratically driving Julian to have an accident. Julian dies and Cathy is injured, but alive. Ten months later, after the birth of her son, Jory, Cathy opens her own ballet school. Carrie meets and falls in love with a local minister named Alex, who proposes. Carrie is unsure about being a minister's wife, recalling their grandmother's statements of how she and her siblings are unholy abominations, but Cathy tells her to forget the past and look towards the future. Carrie encounters Corrine at a charity gathering and invites her to the wedding, but Corrine denies Carrie as her daughter. The next morning, Cathy and Chris find that Carrie has committed suicide by consuming poison- laced doughnuts (the same technique that was used to kill her twin). Cathy vows revenge on their murdering mother, despite Chris warily trying to talk her out of it. She hires Corrine's husband Bart Winslow as her attorney, under the guise of reviving the Sheffield estate, with the intent of seducing him. Bart is instantly attracted to her and they begin an affair. Pressured by his boss, Chris proposes to Sarah and she accepts. However, the day before the wedding, Chris admits to Cathy he still loves her and doesn't want to marry Sarah. Cathy tells him that while she still does love him, she wants him to move on with his life, as their relationship can't lead to anything. Despite this, the two irresistibly end up sharing a passionate kiss. Sarah walks in and, horrified, ends her engagement with Chris, who is fired from his job as rumors of the incestuous relationship spread. Chris asks Cathy to bring Jory and start a new life with him in California, where no one will know them. However, Cathy reveals that she is pregnant with Bart's child and intends to finish what she started. Chris decides to go with her to finally confront their mother and they sneak into Foxworth Hall on the day of Corrine's Christmas party. Cathy encounters her grandmother and confronts her about her religious hypocrisy and abuse towards her and her siblings. Undeterred, Olivia tells her that while she can abandon the family she will nevertheless forever be \\"the devil's spawn.\\" During the party, Cathy reveals her identity and her mother's crimes to the stunned guests. Corrine initially denies everything, but Bart is suspicious and Olivia refuses to defend her. Corrine finally admits to everything, but insists she never intended to kill Cory or have the children put in the attic, defending her actions on the basis that her father would have rejected her and left all of them out of his will. Cathy then publicly reveals her pregnancy caused by Bart. Corrine blames Olivia for forcing her to put the children in the attic. Olivia counters that the children are abominations and didn't deserve to be born. She gives Corrine a trunk of her old possessions, which when opened reveal the skeletal remains of Cory. Corrine has a mental breakdown and sets the bed and her mother on fire. Bart rushes in to save Olivia, but they both die in the flames. Cathy and Chris escape and watch Foxworth Hall burn to the ground. Six years later, Cathy and Chris are now married and happily living in California with Jory and Bart Jr. under the surname Dollanganger. Corrine is institutionalized and deemed incompetent to stand trial for her crimes.

It was also announced by writer Kayla Alpert that the film would take place ten years after Flowers in the Attic, whereas the book picked up directly after the events of the first. Alpert stated that she started working on the script for Petals on the Wind, shortly after she had finished the script for the first film. Executive producer Michelle Weiss stated that adapting Petals on the Wind into film proved to be more difficult that the first one did. She said that while Flowers was a contained story that took place within only one location, Petals has a larger setting, more storylines and takes place during a longer period of time. The biggest challenge was the contain the story within a contained timeframe. She also stated the film takes place in Southern United States during the '70s. =Casting and filming= On January 28, 2014 it was announced that Heather Graham and Ellen Burstyn would reprise their roles from Flowers in the Attic as Corrine and Olivia Foxworth, respectively. On February 18 it was revealed that Rose McIver had landed the role of Cathy Dollanganger, taking over from Kiernan Shipka. During the same month, it was revealed that Wyatt Nash had been cast as Christopher; Bailey De Young role as Carrie was announced the following day. McIver stated that due to the film's rushed production, she only had two weeks after her first audition to practice ballet for her role, before filming started on February 25; this left her unable to read any of the books. Regarding Cathy and Chris' relationshi, she stated that both of the characters \\"know [their relationship]'s a taboo, but nobody else understands them the way they get each other\\" and due to their shared trauma, it's hard for them to connect with anyone else. Nash expressed a similar sentiment, believing that it's impossible for either of them to move forward and live happy lives apart from each other. Production for the movie was rushed and actress Rose McIver, who portrayed Cathy, began filming in February 2014, two weeks after she attended her first audition, leaving her unable to read any of the novels before portraying the role. Immediately after filming was completed in March McIver began work on the television series iZombie. A new character, that of Chris's love interest Sarah, was created for the movie and some portions of the book, notably the sexual relationship between Cathy and her adoptive father, were removed in order to condense the book for film. Of this choice, director Kayla Alpert stated that ‚ÄúAfter doing incest, we decided we didn‚Äôt need pedophilia on top of it\\" and that some of the book's plot had to be condensed for the movie. Release =Ratings= In its original televised airing, Petals on the Wind was watched by 3.42 million viewers, and had a rating of 1.2 in the women 18‚Äì49 age demographic, down 37 percent from the 1.9 earned by Flowers. =Home media= On September 16, 2015, it was released as a single-disc DVD. It was later re-released on June 23, 2015, with Flowers in the Attic as a \\"Double Feature.\\" On November 10, 2015, it was included in a \\"4-Film Collection\\" with Flowers in the Attic, If There Be Thorns, and Seeds of Yesterday. Reception Petals on the Wind averaged 64 out of 100, based on four critics, on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Variety reviewed the film, stating that it \\"looks and feels like a rush job, but improves on its predecessor in nearly every way.\\" The A.V. Club gave the movie a rating of B-, as they felt that it \\"largely skews a bit underbaked to meet the promise of its own third act, and lacks the strength of Ellen Burstyn as its central figure, but there‚Äôs enough of the all-out V.C. Andrews flavor to make this installment worth a look for those who want to catch up with a family of soap people 30 years in the making.\\" Entertainment Weekly described the film as being \\"muted\\", similarly to the first one, and stated that the actors shouldn't have taken the material as seriously as they did. Despite this, they found the film to have numerous instances that either meet or exceed the book's \\"ludicrous level\\". Sequels On the premiere of Petals on the Wind, Lifetime announced the production of the two following books on the Dollanganger series, If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday, both of which aired in 2015.

A supporter of fascism during his youth, he switched to communism by the end of World War II, and became an editor of the Communist Party daily organ, Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ. He taught at the University of Bucharest and worked for the Economic Research Institute. Having campaigned for multilateralism in world affairs as early as 1944, he helped to distance Romania from the Soviet Union after 1964, and later represented his country at the United Nations. He wrote extensively, publishing works on the effects of land reform and industrialization, on the history of economic thought, and on Romania's relations with the Comecon and the First World. An innovator among the Romanian communist intellectual and professional elite, Murgescu spent his final decades questioning the assumptions of Marxian economics. At the Institute for World Economy, which later became a branch of the Romanian Academy, he trained a new generation of like-minded economists. Shortly before his death, he was involved in dissidence against the Nicolae Ceau»ôescu regime. Although he did not live long enough to witness the 1989 Revolution, he played an indirect part in shaping the economic policies to which the country turned in post-communism.

Nevertheless, according to fellow economist Egon Balas, Murgescu was also able to use political censorship for his own gains, \\"manufacturing a conflict\\" with Miron Constantinescu, the ICE researcher and dissident communist, and obtaining his ousting. As a result of this intrigue, Murgescu became sole editor of the ICE academic journal, Revista EconomicƒÉ, in 1958.Balas, pp. 357‚Äì358 Making occasional returns to the field of Marxist economic history, Murgescu wrote propaganda works, accusing the deposed Romanian royal family, and in particular Carol II, of having organized a \\"plunder\\" of Romanian assets.

This work, also put out by Editura Academiei, was revisited some 20 years later by historian Vasile Bogza, who noted that, despite some flawed interpretations, it remained one of the \\"thorough studies\\" in the field.Vasile Bogza, \\"Condi»õiile penetra»õiei capitalului strƒÉin √Æn Rom√¢nia √Æn primul deceniu dupƒÉ Marea Unire din 1918\\", in Revista de Istorie, Nr. 6/1981, p. 1076 A University of Bucharest professor,Boia, p. 16 Murgescu was received as a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1963, earning a doctorate in economics from the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies in 1964.IsƒÉrescu, p. 33 He also served the Institute of South-East European Studies as an academic supervisor for its Revue des √âtudes Sud-est Europ√©enes.Dan Berindei, \\"Revue des √âtudes Sud-est Europ√©enes\\", in Enciclopedia istoriografiei rom√¢ne»ôti, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ »ôi EnciclopedicƒÉ, Bucharest, 1978, p. 454 =National communism= By 1963, Murgescu was called upon by the regime to inform the world about Romania's economic ideology, which was increasingly different from Soviet policies. That year, he denounced the Comecon's \\"pseudo-theories\\" on industrialization, which seemed to offer Romania a subservient economic position within the common market.Brzezinski, pp. 444‚Äì445, 551 In 1964, the PCR leadership called upon Murgescu to publish an even more virulent official reply against the Soviets and the Comecon. By advancing a \\"Valev Plan\\", the Soviets had suggested that Romania become an agricultural hinterland for the more industrialized socialist countries. Murgescu's critiques of this proposal announced a new political stage, of national communism.

Serving as ICE director from 1965 to 1968, Murgescu continued to edit Revista EconomicƒÉ to 1968, then Revista Rom√¢n«é de Rela»õii Interna»õionale (from 1968 to 1970). From June 1969, he had a Tuesday evening show on Radio Romania, as part of the series Tableta de SearƒÉ, which also featured, among others, actor Radu Beligan, mathematician Grigore Moisil, writer Marin Sorescu, and literary scholar Edgar Papu.\\"√én Bucure»ôti, acum 50 de ani\\", in Magazin Istoric, June 2019, p. 83 He moved from ICE to the Institute for World Economy (IEM), where he worked from 1970 until his death, and was for a while its director. In 1976, he was elected Vice President of the International Marketing Federation. The Romanian position regarding the Comecon was given expression in a 1969 tract Rom√¢nia socialistƒÉ »ôi cooperarea interna»õionalƒÉ (\\"Socialist Romania and International Cooperation\\"), which came out at Editura PoliticƒÉ with Murgescu, Mircea Mali»õa and Gheorghe Surpat as the three authors.Kirk Laux, p. 70 In 1974, he published, at Editura Meridiane, the French-language introduction L'economie socialiste en Roumanie (\\"Romania's Socialist Economy\\"). It explained the regime's policy of cooperating with the West in industrial development and scientific research, noting that socialist economies had to catch up with capitalism before the latter could experience a final crisis.L√©on Lavall√©e, \\"Les livres. Costin Murgescu, L'economie socialiste en Roumanie\\", in La Pens√©e, Issue 184, 1975, p. 139 According to Canadian economist Jeanne Kirk Laux, Murgescu was trying to reconcile Romania's relations with multinational corporations with Ceau»ôescu's \\"national sovereignty obsession\\".Kirk Laux, pp. 71‚Äì72 Indirectly, the book documents the regime's efforts to compensate for the high price of Western technology by proposing various methods of counter trade (methods which, Kirk Laux notes, Murgescu claimed as original Romanian contributions to the theory of international trade).Kirk Laux, p. 85 Murgescu was particularly interested in Romanian economic history in relation to the global economy, and a pioneer of interdisciplinarity.IsƒÉrescu, p. 36 In 1967, he returned to sociology by contributing to a collective study on \\"the effects of industrialization on social mobility\\".\\"Revue des revues. Recherches sociographiques: 312\\", in Revue Fran√ßaise de Sociologie, Vol. 8, Issue 4, 1967, pp. 593‚Äì594 With Damian Hurezeanu, Murgescu was a guest of the 15th International Congress of Historical Sciences (Bucharest, 1980), where they presented a new synthesis of land reform policies in interwar Romania.Dan Berindei, \\"Cel de-al XV-lea Congres Interna»õional de »òtiin»õe Istorice: stadiul sƒÉu de pregƒÉtire\\", in Revista de Istorie, Nr. 6/1980, p. 1182 He followed up with several studies, including his signature work, Mersul ideilor economice la rom√¢ni (\\"The Development of Economic Ideas among the Romanians\\", 1987 (vol.

He published his notes on the New International Economic Order in Partners in East-West Economic Relations, a collection of studies edited by Zolt√°n Fallenb√ºchl and C. H. McMillan for Pergamon Press. They outlined Romania's support for the New International Economic Order and her critique of the Soviet Union. As Murgescu argued, the Soviet economy was to be taxed the same as a capitalist developed country when contributing to the United Nations Development Programme.Elizabeth K .

Columbia University (National Council for Soviet and East European Research), New York City, [n. y.], pp. 50‚Äì51 Murgescu spent the last stage of his life as a dissident, in latent conflict with Ceau»ôescu. At the IEM, he helped organize debates about politics and economics, introduced Romanian students to the core notions of supply-side economics, and made hints about the need for profound change.IsƒÉrescu, pp. 33‚Äì36 Reportedly, Murgescu's 1982 work on the Japanese economic miracle was a Romanian best-seller. Allegedly, Murgescu had come to believe that the Valev Plan was a consistent form of economic integration, and that national communism was essentially flawed. Foreign Minister »òtefan Andrei shielded Murgescu from Ceau»ôescu's anger, and allowed him to maintain a link with the West through contacts with Reuters.

As a learning institution, the IEM was the alma mater of economists who rose to political prominence after 1989, among them Eugen DijmƒÉrescu, Mugur IsƒÉrescu, Napoleon Pop, and Victor Babiuc.IsƒÉrescu, p. 34 Iulian Anghel, \\"Bogdan Murgescu, istoric al economiei: AdevƒÉrata provocare va fi c√¢nd Rom√¢nia va atinge 60% din PIB-ul UE, nu acum c√¢nd are 43%\\", in Ziarul Financiar, March 17, 2011 In 1990, it was renamed the \\"Costin Murgescu Institute of World Economy\\", becoming part of the Romanian Academy network.Eugen StrƒÉu»õiu, \\"Economical Think-tanks in Romania\\", in Revista EconomicƒÉ, Nr. 1‚Äì2/2010, p. 14 According to IsƒÉrescu: \\"At the Institute for World Economy, professor Costin Murgescu was able to fulfill his calling on many levels. Constantly preoccupied with establishing a Romanian school of economic research, he turned [the IEM] into a veritable creative workshop.\\" As noted in 2010 by sociologist Zolt√°n Rost√°s, Murgescu's \\"sinuous youth\\" was \\"hardly mentioned\\", \\"but [he] was nearly sanctified by the elite of economists who are now in their sixties.\\" Murgescu was survived by his wife, Ecaterina Oproiu, who went on to serve as a Presidential appointee on a visual media regulatory agency, the National Audiovisual Council, between 1992 and 2000.Antoaneta TƒÉnƒÉsescu, \\"Consiliul Na»õional al Audiovizualului - scurtƒÉ istorie\\", in Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ de Jurnalism »ôi Comunicare, Nr. 1‚Äì2/2008, pp. 32, 33, 35, 38 Murgescu's nephew, Bogdan Murgescu, also trained in economic history, and achieved notoriety for his analysis of economic backwardness.

Just like nearby parts of Lorraine, the Alsace bossue is linguistically predominantly located into the Rhine Franconian area.  History  The current borders of this territory date back from 1793, when the County of Saarwerden was annexed by the young French First Republic. Initially, the county of Saarwerden was meant to be fragmented and distributed between the departments of Moselle, Meurthe and/or Bas-Rhin,Georg Friedrich von Martens - Recueil des principaux trait√©s d'alliance, de paix, de tr√™ve (1800) but its inhabitants were against the fragmentation, and as such the project was afterwards cancelled. The county was then temporarily absorbed by the nearby districts of Moselle and Meurthe until a final decision was made. Towards the end of the year 1793, it was finally decided that the entire territory would be given to the Bas-Rhin department, essentially due to religious reasons, as the Sarrewerden county had been protestant since the Reformation while Lorraine (Moselle and Meurthe) had remained almost exclusively catholic. At the same time, the Moselle department gave to Bas- Rhin the municipalities of Bouquenom and Vieux Sarverden (today Sarrewerden),Ldh/EHESS/Cassini - Notice Communale both historical capitals of the Saarwerden county, which had been enclaves of the Duchy of Lorraine or the Kingdom of France within the county since 1697. Another county that is often considered to be a part of Alsace bossue was the County of L√ºtzelstein (comt√© de la Petite-Pierre), which belonged to the Rhine Palatinate throughout most of its existence. Although most of the county is today part of the Bas-Rhin department, some of its historical villages, including Achen, Berling, Bourscheid, Hangviller, Lixheim, Montbronn, Phalsbourg, Vescheim, Wintersbourg and Zilling, are today part of the Moselle department.

Shardeloes - the Drake family seat Early life and family Thomas Drake was born on 14 January 1749 the second but oldest surviving son of William Drake, MP for Amersham from 1746 to 1796, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Raworth of London. He was educated at Westminster School and Brasenose College, Oxford. His elder brother was William Drake, who predeceased their father. Thomas adopted the surname Tyrwhitt in 1776 in order to inherit the estates of his cousin Sir John de la Fountain Tyrwhitt, 6th Baronet, and then the additional surname of Drake in 1796 when his father died. He married, on 8 August 1780, Anne Wickham, a daughter of the Rev. William Wickham of Garsington, Oxfordshire. The Rev. Wickham was the proprietor of the manor of Garsington and, when he died, 1770, the estates passed to Anne; when she married Tyrwhitt-Drake, they entered his family and remained part of its estate until it was sold in 1914 to Philip Morrell. (exact page not available - online edition) Together, they had five sons and three daughters: * Captain Thomas Tyrwhitt-Drake (1783 - 1852) was a Member of Parliament for Amersham from 1805 to 1832. * William Tyrwhitt-Drake (1785 - 1848) was a Member of Parliament for Amersham from 1810 to 1832. * Reverend John Tyrwhitt-Drake, Rector of Amersham, married Mary Annesley, third daughter of Arthur Annesley of Bletchingdon, Oxfordshire. He married secondly Emily Drake-Garrard, fifth daughter of Charles Drake Garrard. * Reverend George Tyrwhitt-Drake, Rector of Malpas, Cheshire. He married Jane Halsey, second daughter of Joseph Halsey of Gaddesden. * Frederick William Tyrwhitt- Drake. * Mary Frances Tyrwhitt-Drake. * Anne Tyrwhitt-Drake. She married Hugh Richard Hoare, of Lillingstone, Buckinghamshire. * Louisa Isabella Tyrwhitt- Drake. She married the Rev. John Anthony Partridge, rector of Cranwich, Norfolk. He held the post of Sheriff of Glamorganshire for the year 1786-7 and was commissioned into the Amersham Volunteer Infantry as a Captain in 1798. Member of Parliament The borough of Amersham was a \\"Rotten Borough\\" in which a leading family, here the Drakes, controlled the seat and could effectively choose who the borough's two Members of Parliament were. Since 1790, William Drake and his son, also called William, were the two Members; however, in 1795, the younger William died and so Tyrwhitt-Drake, being the next younger son, filled his vacant seat. A year later, the elder William resigned his seat and died shortly afterwards. He was largely a supporter of the administration of William Pitt the Younger, and did not oppose that of Henry Addington. He was considered less reliable in 1804 and voted to have Lord Melville prosecuted the following year. He went on to vote with ministers in 1810. He is not known to have spoken in the House. He died before the end of Parliament, on 18 October 1810, and his son, William Tyrwhitt filled his seat (his older son, Thomas, having been a Member since 1805).

During the colonial era, due to the distrust that existed in northwest Somalia towards British colonial administrators, there was minimal development in healthcare training. The BMA (British Military Administration) diminished the inflow of Italians into southern Somalia which hampered the building of facilities.Rodger, F.

Jaamac Cumar Ciise, 2005, Taariikhdii daraawiishta iyo Sayid Maxamad Cabdille Xasan, 1895-1920 Until the collapse of the federal government in 1991, the organizational and administrative structure of Somalia's healthcare sector was overseen by the Ministry of Health. Regional medical officials enjoyed some authority, but healthcare was largely centralized. The socialist government of former President of Somalia Siad Barre had put an end to private medical practice in 1972.Maxamed Siyaad Barre (1970) My country and my people: the collected speeches of Major-General Mohamed Siad Barre, President, the Supreme Revolutionary Council, Somali Democratic Republic, Vol. 3, Ministry of Information and National Guidance, p. 141. Much of the national budget was devoted to military expenditure, leaving few resources for healthcare, among other services. The Gardo General Hospital in Qardho is one of Somalia's many new private healthcare facilitiesSomalia's public healthcare system was largely destroyed during the ensuing civil war. As with other previously nationalized sectors, informal providers have filled the vacuum and replaced the former government monopoly over healthcare, with access to facilities witnessing a significant increase. Many new healthcare centers, clinics, hospitals and pharmacies have in the process been established through home- grown Somali initiatives. The cost of medical consultations and treatment in these facilities is low, at $5.72 per visit in health centers (with a population coverage of 95%), and $1.89‚Äì3.97 per outpatient visit and $7.83‚Äì13.95 per bed day in primary through tertiary hospitals. Comparing the 2005‚Äì2010 period with the half-decade just prior to the outbreak of the conflict (1985‚Äì1990), life expectancy actually increased from an average of 47 years for men and women to 54 years for men and 57 years for women. UNDP (2001). Human Development Report 2001-Somalia. New York: UNDP. Child mortality and morbidity The last three decades of armed conflicts, lack of functioning government, economic collapse, and disintegration of the health system and other public services - together with recurrent droughts and famines ‚Äì has turned Somalia into one of the world‚Äôs most difficult environments for survival. This is bluntly reflected in the poor child health conditions, as twenty per cent of the children die before they reach the age of five, more than one third are underweight, and almost fifty per cent suffer from stunting. The under-five mortality rate in Somalia is among the highest in the world, while the prevalence of malnutrition has remained at record high levels for decades. It is therefore likely that malnutrition contributes to more than half of the under-five deaths in Somalia. Pneumonia, diarrhoea and neonatal causes account for a large proportion of childhood deaths. The number of one- year-olds fully immunized against measles rose from 30% in 1985‚Äì1990 to 40% in 2000‚Äì2005,World Bank and UNDP (2003). Socio-Economic Survey-Somalia-2004. Washington, D.C./New York: UNDP and World Bank. and for tuberculosis, it grew nearly 20% from 31% to 50% over the same period. In keeping with the trend, the number of infants with low birth weight fell from 16 per 1000 to 0.3, a 15% drop in total over the same timeframe.World Bank and UNDP (2003). Socio- Economic Survey-Somalia-1999. Washington, D.C./New York: UNDP and World Bank. Between 2005‚Äì2010 as compared to the 1985‚Äì1990 period, infant mortality per 1,000 births also fell from 108 to 85. Significantly, Maternal mortality Maternal mortality per 100,000 births fell from 1,600 in the pre-war 1985‚Äì1990 half-decade to 850 in the 2015.UNDP (2006). Human Development Report 2006. New York: UNDP. The number of physicians per 100,000 people also rose from 3.4 to 4 over the same timeframe, as did the percentage of the population with access to sanitation services, which increased from 18% to 26%. According to United Nations Population Fund data on the midwifery workforce, there is a total of 429 midwives (including nurse-midwives) in Somalia, with a density of 1 midwife per 1,000 live births. Eight midwifery institutions presently exist in the country, two of which are private. Midwifery education programs on average last from 12 to 18 months, and operate on a sequential basis. The number of student admissions per total available student places is a maximum 100%, with 180 students enrolled as of 2009. Midwifery is regulated by the government, and a license is required to practice professionally. A live registry is also in place to keep track of licensed midwives. In addition, midwives in the country are officially represented by a local midwives association, with 350 registered members. polio vaccination According to a 2005 World Health Organization estimate, about 97.9% of Somalia's women and girls underwent female circumcision, a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa and parts of the Near East.Herbert L.

By 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern Puntland and Somaliland regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign. About 93% of Somalia's male population is also reportedly circumcised. Somalia has one of the lowest HIV infection rates on the continent. This is attributed to the Muslim nature of Somali society and adherence of Somalis to Islamic morals. While the estimated HIV prevalence rate in Somalia in 1987 (the first case report year) was 1% of adults, a more recent estimate from 2014 now places it at only 0.5% of the nation's adult population.

Health Sector Strategic Plans Caring for a bone fracture In March 2013, the federal government under former Minister of Health Maryam Qaasim launched the Health Sector Strategic Plans (HSSPs) for each of Somalia's constituent zones. The new national health system aims to provide universal basic healthcare to all citizens by 2016. While the government's institutional capacity is developing, UN agencies would in the interim through public-private partnerships administer immunization among other associated health programs. The HSSPs are valued at $350 USD million in total, with between 70%-75% earmarked for health services. Once finalized, the new national healthcare system is expected to ameliorate human capital in the health sector, as well as improve funding for health programs and overall health infrastructure. In May 2014, the Federal Government launched the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) within the framework of the Health Sector Strategic Plans. The EPHS was originally designed in 2008 by the Somali Ministry of Health, with the goal of establishing standards for national health services vis-a-vis governmental and private healthcare providers, as well as for partnered UN agencies and NGOs. It aims to provide a holistic spectrum of free health services to all citizens, including in rural areas. With a focus on strengthening reproductive and emergency obstetric care services for women and children, the EPHS's core programmes are to eliminate communicable illness; ameliorate reproductive, neonatal, child and maternal health; improve health control and surveillance, including water and sanitation promotion; supply first-aid and treatment to the terminally ill or wounded; and to treat common illnesses, HIV and other STDs, and tuberculosis. The Somali health authorities are slated to implement the Essential Package of Health Services in nine regions, with UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO representatives providing additional support. The initiative will continue through to the end of 2016, and is expected to ensure that health facilities operate with better equipment, more healthcare workers, and for longer shifts. It is also centered on growing institutional capacity through training medical personnel, health sector reform, and policy development facilitation.

Although she was capable of competing at the highest level against specialist sprinters, she showed her best form over distances between 1400 metres and 1600 metres. Having been bought cheaply as a yearling, she showed promise as a two-year-old in 1976 before emerging as a top-class performer in the following year. As a three- year-old she won the 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes, Prix d'Astarte and Prix de la For√™t, finished third in the 1000 Guineas and the Prix du Moulin and was sold for a hundred times her original price. Sanedtki reached her peak as a four- year-old in 1979, taking the Prix Edmond Blanc, Prix de Ris-Orangis, Prix du Moulin and a second Prix de la For√™t, as well as finishing second in the July Cup and the Vernons Sprint Cup. She ended the season as the highest-rated older female racehorse in Europe by both the official International Classification and the independent Timeform organisation as well as being named Champion Racehorse of Europe. She was sent to race in California in 1979 where she won both her races including the Grade I Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap. In all she recorded ten wins, seven seconds and five third places in twenty-five races. After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare, first in the United States, and then in Ireland, but was not particularly successful, producing only two minor winners from five recorded foals. Background Sanedtki was a bay mare with a narrow white stripe and a white sock on her right hind leg bred in Ireland by Jim Powell (1912-2012). She was from the first crop of foals sired by Sallust an outstanding miler who won the Sussex Stakes and the Prix du Moulin in 1972. Sallust went on to sire the colt Tap On Wood, whose wins included the winner of the 1979 2000 Guineas. Sanedtki's dam, Fortlin, and grand-dam Creepy Crawley were moderate racehorses, but the latter was a half-sister of the July Cup winner Vilmoray. As a yearling she was offered for sale and bought for 1,050 guineas by a partnership headed by G. Samana. She was sent into training with Olivier Douieb in France. The filly was named by combining the names of her owners, Samana, Nedjar and Tkiar (the partners had another horse named Nedsatki). Racing career =1976: two-year-old season= Sanedtki began her racing career by finishing third to Assez Cuite in the Prix Yacowlef over 1000 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August. After finishing unplaced on her next appearance she won an eight-runner maiden race over 1700m at Longchamp Racecourse in September. She was then moved up in class for the Group Three Prix des R√©servoirs over 1600m at Longchamp a month later and finished second, a length behind the 20/1 outsider Edinburgh. =1977: three-year-old season= In April 1977, Sanedtki was sent to England and was matched against Cloonlara, the leading Irish filly of the previous season, in the 1000 Guineas Trial at Ascot Racecourse. The ground at Ascot was so soft that the starting stalls could not be used and the race was started by flag. Cloonlara was left at the start and Sanedtki won by one and a half lengths from Mofida. In the 1000 Guineas a month later she was restrained in the early stages and was last of the eighteen runners with three furlongs left to run. She made rapid progress in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win, finishing third behind Mrs McArdy and Freeze The Secret. On her return to France she was moved up in distance and finished third to Madelia in the Prix Saint-Alary on 22 May. She raced in England for the third time when she contested the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June but ran poorly to finish fourth behind Orchestration. She was subsequently revealed to have been in season at the time of the race. On 7 August, Sanedtki started the 6.3/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Prix d'Astarte over 1600m at Deauville, in which her opponents included Waya, River Dane (Child Stakes) and Hartebeest (Prix de la Grotte). Ridden as usual by Alain Lequeux, she won by three-quarters of a length from Hartebeest, with Silk Slipper a length away in third. Three weeks later, over the same course and distance, she finished second, beaten half a length by the five-year-old Trepan in the Prix Quincey. In the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp on 25 September, he finished third to Pharly and Monseigneur, with Flying Water in fifth. In October, Sanedtki was offered for sale at the Polo Club Sale and was bought for ‚Ç£1,000,000 (approximately 100 times her price when sold as a yearling) by Bernard Zimmerman. It had been intended that the filly would be exported to race in the United States, but remained in Europe because of quarantine restrictions imposed after an outbreak of metritis in Europe. On 23 October, the filly made her first appearance for her new owners when she started a 16/1 outsider for the Group One Prix de la For√™t over 1400m at Longchamp. The betting was headed by Pharly and the leading sprinter Gentilhombre, twice winner of the Prix de l'Abbaye. Sanedtki recorded her first Group One success, beating Pharly by two lengths. =1978: four-year-old season= Sandetki began her third season on 9 March in the Prix Edmond Blanc over 1550m at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and won by three lengths from Beaune at odds of 1.3/1. Eighteen day later, she started odds-on favourite for the Prix de Ris-Orangis at √âvry and won by half a length from Steel Band. On 1 May she was beaten into second place when attempting to concede ten pounds to the four-year-old colt Faraway Times in the Prix du Muguet at Saint-Cloud. She was then sent to the United States to contest the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park. Racing on dirt for the first time she appeared unsuited by the surface and finished sixth behind Cox's Ridge. On her return to Europe, Sanedtki, now racing in the colours of Serge Fradkoff, was moved down to sprint distances for the July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse in which she produced a strong late run but failed by a neck to overhaul the favourite Solinus. On 5 August she started odds-on favourite for the Prix Maurice de Gheest at Deauville, but finished third of the twelve runners behind King of Macedon and Polyponder. She then finished second to Kenmare in the Prix Jacques Le Marois over the same course eight days later. On 3 September, Sanedtki started favourite for the Prix du Rond Point over 1600 metres at Longchamp but was beaten into second place by the British colt Homing to whom she was conceding six pounds. Sanedtki clashed with Homing again in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp three weeks later, when the other runner included Nishapour (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), Kenmare, Carwhite (Prix d'Ispahan) and Dom Racine (Prix Jean Prat). The filly was held up by Lequeux at the rear of the field as Homing set a strong pace. In the straight, Sanedtki produced what Timeform described as a \\"breathtaking turn of speed\\" overtaking the whole field and winning by two lengths from Homing, with a gap of five lengths back to Nishapour in third. On 22 October, Sanedtki attempted to become the first horse in twenty-four years to win consecutive runnings of the Prix de la For√™t, and started 11/10 favourite in a field which included King of Macedon, Faraway Times and Polyponder. She recorded her third Group One win, beating the British-trained outsider Green Girl by two lengths. On her final race in Europe, Sanedtki was brought back in distance for the Vernons Sprint Cup over six furlongs at Haydock Park Racecourse and started favourite ahead of the Ayr Gold Cup winner Vaigly Great. She looked likely to win entering the last quarter mile but was unable to sustain her challenge and was beaten three-quarters of a length by the 20/1 outsider Absalom. =1979: five-year-old season= Sanedtki was belatedly sent to the United States in 1979 and was trained in California by Charles Whittingham. Racing at Santa Anita Park she won the Sierra Madre Handicap over six and a half furlongs before ending her career with a victory in the Grade I Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap over nine furlongs. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year- olds in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. The French handicapper awarded her a weight of 121 pounds, five below the top filly Kamicia and eighteen below the top colt Blushing Groom. The independent Timeform organisation rated her on 115 fifteen pounds below the Irish-trained filly Cloonlara and sixteen below Blushing Groom. In the following year, she was rated 126 by Timeform, seven pounds behind their best three-year-old filly Dunfermline. In the official International Classification for three-year-olds she was rated seven pounds inferior to Dunfermline and Madelia, the top-rated fillies. Sanedtki achieved her best Timeform rating of 129 in 1978, making her the highest-rated older female racehorse of the year, alongside Trillion. Her rating placed her a pound behind Timeform's best sprinter Solinus, and a pound behind their best miler Homing. In their annual Racehorses of 1978, Timeform described her as \\"admirably genuinely and consistent\\". In the Gilbey Champion Racehorse awards, based on points awarded for performances in major races, Sanedtki was named Champion Racehorse of Europe (jointly with Trillion). In the International Classification for 1978, Sanedtki again tied with Trillion as the best older female racehorse in Europe and the fifth best horse of any age or sex. Breeding record Sanedtki was retired from racing to become a broodmare in the United States. She was auctioned three times, being sold for $250,000 in November 1986, for $275,000 in January 1988 (at the sale of Nelson Bunker Hunt's horses) and for $75,000 in November 1989, after which she was sent to continue her breeding career in Ireland. She produced at least five foals between 1982 and 1993: *Metropolitan Star (bay filly, foaled 1982, sired by Lyphard), won one race *Blushing Lass (chestnut filly, 1985, by Blushing Groom), unraced *Skidmore Girl (brown filly, 1988, by Vaguely Noble), failed to win in five races *Sirsan (bay colt, 1990, by Sir Ivor) won one race, ran in the Irish Derby *First One Up (colt 1993, by Fairy King), unraced Pedigree References Category:1974 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 22-a ","title":"Sanedtki"},{"id":"43126653","text":"The Stubb Cabinet was the 73rd Government of Finland, which stepped into office on 24 June 2014.

Rape Scandal Gumbura was convicted of four counts of rape and one on possession of pornographic material. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison and is currently serving his sentence at Zimbabwe's notorious Chikurubi Prison. His church was also suspended by Zimbabwe's religious body, ACCZ, for \\"Satanic practices\\" and for the child abuse allegations against Robert Gumbura. Parliament is currently seeking to permanently ban the church. Born in Kenzamba, Zimbabwe on the 29th of July 1956, he is alleged to have abused his congregants for over 30 years. Gumbura had given himself the authority to have sex with any female congregant of his choice in his church regardless of their marital status and could ‚Äúloan‚Äù them out to their husbands, but still retain certain rights. These rights included him being able to continue to have sexual intercourse with any women, despite their marital status. Gumbura was viewed as God in the church and indoctrinated his followers into believing that God directly communicated with him and gave him authority to do as he pleased. He said the church had songs composed in praise of Gumbura. Leaked WhatsApp messages between two women who consented to having sex with Gumbura, despite one of them being married, revealed that of all the countless women Gumbura had sex with, he only used a condom on just one woman, who was described as \\"very beautiful but risky\\" - whereas the rest \\"sampled his anaconda live and direct\\". According to the leaked WhatsApp chat a married woman and that woman's daughter once took turns to have sex with Gumbura. His span of control expanded all over Zimbabwe, and also in overseas countries such as the Leeds in the UK.

It is raised throughout the Valtellina, from which its principal name derives, in the Val Malenco and the upper Val Masino in the Rhaetian Alps, and in the Valchiavenna. It may also be called the Frontalasca, for the village of Frontale, a frazione of the comune of Sondalo in the Val di Rezzalo, or the Rezzalasca for that valley. The name Frisa comes from its frisature, or Swiss markings. History The Frisa Valtellinese shares common characteristics and origins with the Swiss B√ºndner Strahlenziege, or Grisons Striped, breed from the Swiss canton of the Grisons to the north-east, and with similar goats in the canton of Ticino immediately to the north of Sondrio. It also shows phenotypic similarity to the British Alpine breed, but does not share its history. The breed was officially recognised and a herd-book established in 1997. The Frisa Valtellinese is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders. At the end of 2013 the registered population was variously reported as 2810 and as 2432. Use The milk yield per lactation of the Frisa Valtellinese is for primiparous, for secondiparous, and for pluriparous, nannies. The milk averages 3.23% fat and 3.04% protein. The viul√¨n de c√†vra de Ciav√©na, a goat's meat prosciutto, is made with the meat. The breed shows promise for vegetation management for the purpose of fire prevention.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Similar legislation, , was introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). Background An injury is the damage to a biological organism caused by physical harm. Major trauma is injury that can potentially lead to serious outcomes. For research purposes the definition is often based on an injury severity score (ISS) of greater than 15. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Improving Trauma Care Act of 2014 would amend the Public Health Service Act, with respect to trauma care and research programs, to include in the definition of \\"trauma\\" an injury resulting from extrinsic agents other than mechanical force, including those that are thermal, electrical, chemical, or radioactive. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 3, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3548 would amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the definition of trauma as it applies to grants and activities authorized to provide support for trauma and emergency care. Under current law, the definition of trauma means an injury resulting from exposure to a mechanical force. The bill would expand the definition of trauma to also include an injury resulting from exposure to an extrinsic agent that is thermal, electrical, chemical, or radioactive. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 3548 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. The bill would not impose intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Improving Trauma Care Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 20, 2013 by Rep. Bill Johnson (R, OH-6). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. On May 20, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-458. The House voted on June 24, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. The United States Senate voted on July 31, 2014 to pass with bill with unanimous consent and it was signed into law on August 8, 2014 by President Barack Obama. Debate and discussion The American Burn Association, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, the American College of Emergency Physicians, America's Essential Hospitals, the American College of Surgeons, the American Trauma Society, and the Trauma Center Association of America wrote a joint letter calling themselves \\"organizations representing the trauma care community\\" in support of H.R. 3548 and the change of the statutory definition of \\"trauma.\\" According to the organizations, the existing definition of \\"trauma\\" is too narrow and \\"excludes burn centers from participating in federal programs designed to support emergency medical care for those suffering from traumatic injuries or to compete for federal research support targeting trauma.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Trauma center References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3548 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3548 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3548 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3548 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3548 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3548 Category:United States federal health legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Improving Trauma Care Act of 2014"},{"id":"43126811","text":"Mark Wells (born 22 April 1973) is an Australian musician and record producer, best known as the bass player for The Ronnie Wood Band, and the founding member of Twenty Two Hundred.

Henricia sanguinolenta is very similar to Henricia oculata, also known as \\"bloody Henry\\", and the two can only be distinguished by laboratory tests. It comes in colors of red, yellow, orange, purple, and lavender. Habitat Henricia sanguinolenta is found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. The sea star can be seen on the beach, under rocks, in tidal pools when available, and on gravel. Its aquatic biomes are the coastal and benthic zones. The sea star is almost always found near sponges and coral because of the currents they create, making it easier for the sea star to filter feed. Henricia sanguinolenta is found from depths of 0 to 2414 meters. Diet Henricia sanguinolenta is a planktivore and carnivore. The sea star filter feeds upon detritus and plankton floating in the water, and uses currents made by sponges or coral to make this process easier. Henricia feeds on plankton, sponge tissue, ascidians, and other invertebrates. It is eaten by vertebrates. Reproduction ;Sexual reproduction: Henricia sanguinolenta is a stable gonochoric. The sea star usually reproduces during February and May. The sea stars migrate to warm, shallow water during the breeding season. The sea stars mate through disk fusion. The eggs are then kept under the disk of the female starfish to incubate after fertilization occurs. After incubation, the female deposits its eggs on the ground, secretes mucus onto them, and then stays on top of the eggs for three weeks while they hatch. The sea stars are polygamous. Henricia sanguinolenta has a diploid chromosome number of 36. ;Asexual reproduction: Although Henricia sanguinolenta can reproduce sexually, it can also reproduce asexually. It reproduces asexually through the process of regeneration. The sea star can go through regeneration if the disc is split in half, or even if a ray is cut off. The regeneration process takes weeks to months to complete. Anatomy ;Rays: Henricia sanguinolenta is an invertebrate. It has slender five rays that taper evenly to tips that are connected by a central disc. The sea star grows to a diameter of 5 to 12 centimeters. On the oral side, the rays are smooth and have an ambulacral groove that contains two tube foot rows. On the dorsal side, the rays are rough with groupings of spinelets, each one have three to six glassy points. The sides of the rays are curving and smooth. The rays contain many of the organs in the sea star. On the tips of the rays are the eyespots. These are dark pigmented organs that sense the presence of light. The rays also contain parts of the pyloric stomach, parts of the nervous system, and most other organs. ;Tube foot rows: The tube foot rows are on the oral side of the rays. Each ray has two tube foot rows. The tube foot rows are attached to the rays by ambulacral grooves. The Tube Foot Rows use a chemical adhesive to stick to surfaces instead of suction. The tube foot rows help the sea star stick to its prey, and to bring the prey to its mouth. The tube foot rows also aid in gas exchange. the tube foot rows are sensitive to chemicals enabling the sea star to detect chemical trails left by possible food. The tube foot rows also excrete waste ammonia through diffusion. ;Nervous system: Henricia sanguinolenta has no brain, but has a nervous system. The sea star has no capacity for planning. The nervous system has two parts. They are motor system and the sensory system which are interconnected by neurons. The motor system is responsible for movement and functioning and the sensory system is responsible for controlling the sensory organs. Both of these systems run up and down the arms, and around the disc. ;Vascular tube system: Henricia sanguinolenta, like all other sea stars, uses water instead of blood. Henricia sanguinolenta pumps filtered seawater in and out of its body. This seawater is transported through a vascular tube system, and delivers nutrients to the different organs and helps in gas exchange. Water enters through the madreporite, a sieve-like structure on the oral side. ;Body wall: The body wall is composed of epidermis, dermis, thin cuticle, and a thin coelomic myoepithelial layer. ;Digestive system/stomachs: Henricia sanguinolenta has two stomachs, a small intestine, and a rectum leading to an anus. The two stomachs are called the cardiac stomach, and the pyloric stomach. The cardiac stomach is on the oral side, in the center of the disc. It is covered by a thin membrane and sphincter. When the sea star has its prey, it extends the stomach to envelope the prey. Once the prey is enveloped, it then retracts back into the disc, and transfers it to the pyloric stomach for further digestion. The pyloric stomach has two extensions into each arm called the pyloric caeca. These secrete digestive enzymes into the pyloric stomach. Then, the waste is transported through a short intestine, and rectum. The material that is left is secreted through a small anus on the oral side of the disc. ;Papulae: The papulae are small are small gills on the rays and disc. Waste ammonia is transported to the tips of the papulae using phagocytic cells, and is then excreted. ;Circulatory System: Henricia sanguinolenta has a circulatory system that forms three rings of vessels. They are called the hyponeural haemal ring, the gastric ring, and the genital ring. The heart beats six times every minute and connects all three vessels. At the base of each ray, there is a pair of gonads. Behavior Henricia sanguinolenta shows behavioral adaptations in addition to physical ones. The sea star is usually seen with sponges and coral, using the currents they make to feed upon detritus. Henricia sanguinolenta is also one of the only species of sea stars that broods its eggs. The female stays with the eggs while they hatch, and continues to stay with them as larvae. The larvae stay in a dome shape created by the female's arms until they are ready to go into the ocean on their own. Until spring time, Henricia sanguinolenta lives a solitary life. Henricia sanguinolenta also doesn't react to the fluid of Asterias forbesi, which is toxic to most other sea stars. Impact on Humans Henricia sanguinolenta has no negative or positive impact on humans. The sea star is not harmful to humans or the economy, and only may slightly affect the tourist industry with its bright colors.

She is the only known soroban abacus master to have reached the eleventh dan. She is also known as Abacus Master (Ï£ºÏÇ∞Ïôï) in South Korea. Biography Lee began training with the soroban abacus in fifth grade. In her first year of high school, she obtained the 11th dan. In 2007, Lee opened up an abacus training academy in Korea, where she has taught thousands of students, some of whom travel to the country solely to participate. In 2001, Lee represented South Korea in the 20th International Abacus Competition and finished in first place in the singles category. In 2008, Lee appeared on the South Korean television program Star King with a group of children ages seven to nine, whom she had taught for a 100-day period. Her students, selected for the program after their parents described them as distracted and underachieving in school, displayed significant improvement in mental calculation skills, as well as in focus and attention. By the end of the program, almost all of the students were able to mentally solve an addition problem of fifteen 5-digit numbers in under thirty seconds. In 2013, Lee appeared on the South Korean television program Miracle Korea. During the episode, she demonstrated her ability to do Flash Anzan, adding together a total of fifty 4-digit numbers individually flashed on a screen for less than one second each, while simultaneously being interviewed by the hosts. During the same episode, she mentally added fifty 25-digit numbers in 94 seconds. In 2016, Lee competed in the Mental Calculation World Cup. The Mental Calculation World Cup 2016 was held from 23-25 September 2016, in Bielefeld, Germany where 31 mental calculators from 16 countries participated.

Biography  He was the second of four children born to , a church and portrait painter, and his wife Josefa-Klara. In 1839, they moved from Brig to Sion and his mother died in 1842. He received his first drawing lessons from his father. From 1851 to 1853, he studied with his uncle, Heinrich Kaiser, who was also a church and portrait painter. His father was displeased with his interest in landscape painting and, as he had also expressed an interest in science during his secondary education, it was suggested that he pursue that course, rather than art. However, he came in contact with the Nazarene painters Paul von Deschwanden and Theodor von Deschwanden (1826‚Äì1861) and, on the basis of their advice, enrolled at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. He was there from 1853 to 1856. His instructors included Heinrich M√ºcke, Karl Ferdinand Sohn, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and Theodor Hildebrandt. After 1860, he worked in the studios of Rudolf Jordan, who introduced him to genre painting with folk life motifs. In 1862, he had his first major success when one of his works was purchased by Kaiser Wilhelm I at an exhibition in Brussels. This enabled him to open his own studio in D√ºsseldorf. He was only there for a year, however, when his father's worsening health forced him to return home and assist with the creation of several altarpieces. After returning to D√ºsseldorf, he fell ill himself and decided to go back to Sion permanently. In the following years, he not only painted, but also wrote numerous works on biology, geology, archaeology and folklore. Many of these writings were published in the yearbooks of the Schweizer Alpen-Club, of which he was a member.Florian Hitz: Die Erstbesteigung des Piz Bernina.

They had five children, including the mathematician and physicist, Walther Ritz. He was later involved in the creation of the Swiss National Museum and was a member of several groups devoted to historical preservation. An unspecified illness began to afflict him in 1889 and it led to his death in 1894. References  Further reading  * Leo Luzian von Roten: \\"Das Leben des Malers Raphael Ritz von Niederwald\\".

Organization In its organization, CISMIL includes: # Planning Bureau; # Research Coordination and Management Bureau; # Production Bureau; # Security and Counter-Information Bureau; # Defense and Military Attach√©s Liaison Office; # Support Section. History CISMIL was created in 2010 in the scope of the reorganization of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Portugal (EMGFA). It is the successor of several Portuguese joint military intelligence services that existed in the past, namely the EMGFA 2nd Division (1974‚Äì75), the SDCI (1975‚Äì1976), the DINFO (1977‚Äì93) and the DIMIL (1993‚Äì97). The framework law of the Informations System of the Portuguese Republic (SIRP) of 1984, predicted the existence of the SIM (Military Informations Service), that however was never created like that, the role of military intelligence continuing to be performed by the DINFO. The reorganization of the SIRP, led to the creation of the SIEDM (Military and Defense Strategic Informations Service) in 1997. The new SIEDM assumed the roles previously planned to be divided by the two distinct and never activated agencies, the SIM (military intelligence) and the SIED (foreign strategic intelligence). In 2007, the new reorganization of the SIRP led again to the separation of the foreign strategic intelligence from the military intelligence. The SIEDM became again the SIED (Defense Strategic Informations Service), with the sole role of foreign intelligence. To fulfill the role of military intelligence, the CISMIL was created in 2010.

It marks the boundary between the Rione Ripa (towards the Aventine Hill) and San Saba (towards the Baths of Caracalla).. The street was built in the 1930s as a major route intended for the linking between Via Ostiense, the station of the Rome‚ÄìLido railway at Porta San Paolo and the Roma Ostiense railway station: it started from Piazza del Circo Massimo (now Piazza di Porta Capena) and ended in Via Marmorata. The first stretch of the street - giving a view over the Circus Maximus - houses the palace of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), formerly built as the seat of the Ministry of the Colonies; for this reason, the first name of the street, adopted in 1938, was Viale Africa. At that time the urbanization of the surrounding area was just at its first steps, so the street had been conceived as an urban promenade, with large sidewalks, four rows of buttonwoods and a tram-line in the middle. The former denomination was suppressed in 1945 and replaced with the present one. In 1955 the name of the last stretch, between Piazza Albania and Via Marmorata, was changed into Viale Manlio Gelsomini.

Renamed \\"Seattle Box Company\\" in 1905, the business purchased a second manufacturing facility in Tacoma in 1922. The two enterprises merged efforts in 1975 as \\"Seattle-Tacoma Box Company,\\" opening a new plant in Kent, Washington. Governor Booth Gardner honored the Nist family and the company on its centennial in 1989, proclaiming the pride of the citizens of Washington for the company's \\"contributions to the economy of the state\\". In addition to wooden boxes and crates, today the company produces packaging supplies, bags, strapping, pallets, fuel pellets, portable moving and storage vaults, and seafood containers. Queen City Box Manufacturing, 1889 to 1905 Stetson- Post Mill ca 1900 Jacob Nist, a farmer and grocer from Philadelphia, migrated to Seattle with his wife and seven children by 1880, and initially took up farming. He and his sons soon found work in the lumber mills. Nist worked for three years as a turner at the Stetson-Post Mill Company in Seattle, and his sons found employment as carpenters and mill engineers. By 1888, Nist and his sons Michael, Jacob J., George, and Aloys were all working at the Seattle Lumber and Commercial Company, which was operating 20 hours per day, and had added a new box factory. That mill was destroyed on June 6, 1889, in the Great Seattle Fire, along with every other mill and wharf between Union and Jackson streets, as well as most of downtown Seattle. Queen City Box Manufacturing Company ‚Äì postcardTo continue providing for the family after the fire, Nist and sons established the Queen City Box Manufacturing company and began production in October 1889. The original Queen City Manufacturing facility was next to the Nist family home on the shore of Lake Union. The company started slowly, and according to the Seattle City Directory three of Nist's sons, Michael, Jacob J., and John were also employed in 1890 by Skookum Manufacturing Company, another local sawmill. The company made millwork, sashes and door frames. The Nists incorporated the company two years into production, in November 1891, with $10,000 capital, 100 shares at $100 each. The company objectives were to \\"manufacture, buy, sell and deal in all kinds of lumber, sashes, doors, window blinds, molding, stairs, stair rails and banisters, and all kinds of woodwork and finishing material‚àíto operate sawmills, sash and door factories, shingle mills, box factories, and to build houses, deal in timber and own land.\\" Seattle experienced rapid growth in the 1890s, as did the new company, despite the temporary setback caused by the economic panic of 1893, which hit the Northwest hard. The Klondike Gold Rush began in 1897, and according to journalist J. Kingston Pierce, \\"Elliott Bay became the frenzied embarkation point for tens of thousands of miners shipping north.\\" The miners provided additional business for Seattle companies that, in turn, required boxes and crates for their products. In 1903, Queen City Manufacturing Company even acquired a mine formerly owned by the Horseshoe Mining Company in Whatcom County, Washington. Seattle Box Company, 1905, built on Elliott Bay tidelands  Seattle Box Company, 1905 to 1920  Michael J. Nist became company president in 1905, but years before that he had become the major decision-maker of the business. Company founder Jacob Nist died in 1907, after almost six months' illness. By that time, the company had been renamed Seattle Box Company, reflecting the chief products of the company: crates, boxes, and shooks. (A shook is a set of wooden staves and headers, for assembling a barrel or cask.) The company was constructing a larger plant on the tideflats of Elliott Bay in South Seattle. The building permit allowed three structures: a factory building, a dry kiln, and boiler room. A photograph by Seattle Times photographers Ira Webster and Nelson Stevens, circa 1905, shows the company surrounded by water, the only building in the area, accessible via a railroad trestle, a causeway built across the bay, and by a 30-foot motor launch kept under the building. Two fires during this period, in 1908 and 1920, destroyed Seattle Box Company's mill building, machinery and stock. The company used insurance reimbursements to re-build each time, and by 1916, assets had more than tripled, from the original $10,000 investment to over $30,000. Seattle Box Company continued production through World War I, running three shifts per day. Michael Nist stepped down as company president in 1920, selling his company shares to his sons Ferdinand and Joseph. He continued writing company checks through 1930, and died in 1932.  Seattle Box Company and Tacoma Box Company, 1920 to 1970  In 1920, Ferdinand J. Nist (\\"F.J.\\") became the third president of the company. He was a graduate of Seattle College, and had learned the family business when he trained \\"as an ordinary workman\\" at the company. =Seattle plant expansion and Tacoma plant purchase in the 1920s= In 1922, the manufacturing plant in Seattle was increased in size to a three-story cutting and assembling facility. The new plant occupied an entire city block, and the company's motto was, \\"A good wood box for the purpose intended at a fair price.\\" The company purchased Calef Box Company in Tacoma in 1922. Joseph Nist undertook management of it as Tacoma Box Company, while planning a new facility. Before the plant was completed, however, Joe Nist died in a drowning accident during a family picnic in 1926, at age 37. Tacoma Box Company moved into new facilities in 1928, under management of Leo Nist. In this decade Seattle Box began modernizing, replacing two horse-drawn delivery carts with its first truck, a chain-driven Pierce Arrow. By the end of the decade, the truck fleet also included a Ford and three Kenworth trucks built in nearby Kirkland, Washington. Since horses were no longer needed for delivery, the old stables under the plant were converted to a dry kiln, which allowed the inventory to include a larger variety of dry lumber stock, and ended the need for a lengthy storage period to air-dry the company's large inventory, of lumber. Other equipment modernization in the twenties included a new Stetson-Ross planer, two Mershon resaw machines, a new lumber carrier, and a new two-color modern design printer for boxes and crates. During the twenties, the Nists also made a strategic decision to serve customers who had to order boxes in small lots, identifying a niche market. (Larger companies usually specialized in specific types of boxes, and required large orders to keep costs down.) The business that began in 1889, with four employees, had over a hundred people on the payroll by 1924, and had extensive business in California and Hawaii. By 1927, Northwest Daily Produce News reported Seattle Box had orders from the West Indies for butter boxes made of odorless spruce, as well as another large order from a local creamery to box premium Edam cheese. In 1928, Seattle Box Company bought a steam whistle from a Yukon River boat to mark starting and stopping times seven times daily‚Äîat five and six and seven a.m., at noon, one, four, and five o'clock. This \\"particularly throaty\\" steam whistle could be heard across a 12-mile (19 km) radius from the plant in downtown Seattle until it was finally retired in 1961, the last steam whistle in Seattle. = Great Depression and labor unrest in the 1930s = From the beginnings of the family business, the Nists owned their business property and equipment outright. The company survived the Great Depression partly because they had avoided debt, partly because they did cost studies and priced products carefully and accurately, and partly because they designed containers for individual customers rather than specializing in a limited product line. The company dealt with recurring challenges during this decade: collections were slow and prices were reduced to maintain business; the National Recovery Administration controlled both prices and profits under the code of fair competition for lumber and timber products; there were three small fires at the Seattle plant in the thirties; and labor unrest resulted in unionizing the workforce, with a 6-week strike in 1935 as well as a week-long walkout in 1937. In spite of his previous \\"hands off\\" policy toward union organizing, Ferdinand Nist became the lead negotiator for industry in the Pacific Northwest, settling with the Sawmill and Lumber Workers of the American Federation of Labor. Rotting timbers in an aging foundation caused a potentially serious collapse of the Seattle plant in 1935. It completely buried one man in sawdust and endangered others who were partially buried. Fortunately, all the buried men were rescued without serious injuries, and the plant was almost immediately re-built on new foundation timbers. Repairs will commence at once. Eugene M. Nist (Gene) began managing the Tacoma plant in 1938. With seven employees, and only the plant supervisor and himself on the regular payroll, Gene took on the role of manager, but also \\"bookkeeper, buyer, labor negotiator, and troubleshooter\\". He scrounged for orders, eventually producing furniture frames for upholstered sofas and box springs. Even with the challenges of the 1930s, Seattle Box Company kept paying dividends on its stock during the decade. In 1938, company president Ferdinand Nist explained in a radio interview that the family company \\"used 12 million feet of spruce and hemlock per year, all produced within of Seattle.\\" = World War II effort of the 1940s = During World War I, the company had heavy demand for boxes and crates, so early in the 1940s, Seattle Box began gearing up production, anticipating increased need for the war effort. The company provided two and a half million boxes during World War II, for transportation of munitions, food, and supplies. The Northwest Veteran saluted the company for \\"the monumental part this company played in the prosecution of the nation's war program in World War II,\\" citing the quality and reliability of its products. Even though both plants were busy during the war, the company did not prosper in the forties due to shortages of lumber and labor as the country's workforce went to war. Minutes of the 1946 stockholders' meeting show the company's lumber inventory had been reduced, from over 3 million board feet in 1942, to just over a million in 1946. After the war, there was pent-up demand not only for boxes and crates, but also for furniture that the Tacoma plant had been producing. The company expanded to produce box-springs, and began an effort to improve handling of lumber to be kiln-dried. Both plants also continued to replace aging steam engines and boilers with electrical mill machinery. But there were no dividends distributed to stockholders for 1946. The trends of the decade were higher wages, shortages of materials, higher prices, and heavy competition, especially from local non-unionized factories. = Changing times in the 1950s = Company profits remained low in the early 1950s. In 1951, Seattle Box reported a loss for only the second time in sixty-two years of operation. A labor strike in 1950, and a 1954 two-month strike affected profits by raising the basic wage to $1.905 per hour. Seattle Box and Tacoma Box sought new products and more efficient ways to produce them. Wooden boxes continued to be the main product, but paper and corrugated cardboard boxes were beginning to affect demand. The Tacoma plant set up a round conveyor system, which was then also implemented in the Seattle plant. The company adopted a new system for coloring boxes in 1957, and in 1958, began using clamp gluing and bulk shipping fasteners developed by North American Aviation. The Seattle and Tacoma plants both needed continuous foundation repairs. The company continued its focus on specialty wood products in the 1950s, adding paneling, siding, and furniture assembly parts, as well as large crates for bulk shipping. According to Wood and Wood Products magazine, \\"Besides boxes, crates, delivery cases and crating lumber, the company also manufactures such apparently non- related items as bed frames, furniture stock, bread boxes, household bins, bed slats, fence pickets, bird houses, and hanging planter baskets.\\" Manufacture of furniture stock (such as overstuffed furniture frames) accounted for 20 percent of the firm's business by 1959, with the total payroll for both plants more than 100 employees. In the late 1950s, Ferdinand J. Nist, Sr.'s sons Emmet and Eugene assumed more responsibilities for company management. Ferdinand, Jr., left Central Washington University for night classes at the University of Washington, and also began working full-time at the Seattle plant in 1958, at age 20. = Revolution in the industry and PerfectioNIST brand in the 1960s = By the early sixties, high lumber prices and competition from new materials, such as fiberboard, paper-overlaid veneer, plastic and metal precipitated revolutionary changes in the container and packaging industry. The Nists had competition from large producers of the new materials, as well as continuing competition from non-unionized companies with pay scales still about half that of Seattle Box. Aging plants presented a second challenge of this period, with maintenance difficulties and less flexibility to handle new products and flow patterns. Operations were beset by pollution, noise and smoke, in spite of new procedures for baling shavings. Leadership at the plant was also in transition, with Gene Nist as vice president at the Tacoma plant and Emmet Nist vice president in Seattle. The firm continued developing alternative ways of using labor and raw materials. A modular panel container system was introduced in 1962, consisting of 50 plywood veneer panels that could be configured 350 different ways. \\"Klimp fasteners\\" replaced nails and cut costs by about a third, making re-use possible ‚Äî and Tacoma Box had become the Northwest distributor. Moving and storage containers and a car kennel kit were also introduced in the sixties. Other new products included a unique box made originally in Japan for sujiko (salmon roe); a container developed for the Dole Food Company to transport pineapple juice concentrate; patented nailless bins for shipping cement and salt to Alaska pipeline developers; and money blanks the size of a dollar bill for the U.S. Treasury Department. Earlier generations of the family business had allowed \\"Nist Bros.\\" to be included in small print on company letterhead, with memos printed on letterhead as the primary means of advertising. But as times changed, Gene Nist developed the trademark \\"PerfectioNIST\\" for the family firm in 1968. Finally, as both plants had become outdated, the Nist family began to discuss building a new facility. A company brochure for new employees noted in 1969, \\"Survival is predicated on changing with the times,\\" and listed the company's motto, \\"Be sure you're right...then hustle.\\"  Merger with new facility, 1970 to present  = New facility and packaging steel pipe in the 1970s = The decade of the seventies brought two major changes: the Seattle and Tacoma plants were merged in a new facility in Kent, between Seattle and Tacoma; and a new method for packaging steel pipeline was developed and patented in that decade for shipping to the Alaska North Slope. The 1970s began with generally difficult circumstances locally: in 1971, a poor salmon run affected demand for sujiko boxes; environmental concerns had repeatedly delayed opening the oil fields in Alaska, affecting orders for the larger containers with capacity of ; and Puget Sound's economy was generally poor, due to layoffs in the airline industry at Boeing. F.J. Nist retired in 1972, and Emmet Nist became president of the company. The Nists also had to contend with two aging plants, and concluded a new, modern facility was needed. Then in September 1973, a spectacular 3-alarm, 12-engine fire at the Seattle plant caused $150,000 in damages to the dry lumber storage facility. Company officers had already identified a site in Kent of alongside the Milwaukie-Union Pacific rail line near the I-405 freeway. Construction on the $1.5 million plant began in 1974, and by spring 1975, the merger was underway, with 75 employees joining together in the renamed Seattle-Tacoma Box Company. Both the Seattle and Tacoma properties were sold to help finance the new property. The new facility provided workspace of under one roof, improving workflow; additionally, the property was large enough to provide a storage site for new clients in the oil pipe industry. Seattle-Tacoma Box Company had been providing nailless containers for shipping supplies to the North Slope oil fields in Alaska, and that ongoing relationship led to the development of new tubular packaging systems patented in 1978 and 1980. The oil pipe packaging developed by Ferdinand Nist, Jr., brought international sales. = Investments in subsidiary plants, 1980s and 1990s = By 1980, the company bought a one-third interest in a corrugated cardboard plant, the Menasha Corporation of Tacoma, and renamed the plant Commencement Bay Corrugated. In order to compete with corporate giants like Weyerhauser and Georgia Pacific, the company expanded its sales force several times. In 1985, the company's subsidiary SeaPro systems began manufacturing paper, corrugated, and wood products for foodservice industries. In 1989, Washington Governor Booth Gardner honored the Nists and their company with a proclamation declaring October 23, 1989, Nist Family Day, for their contributions to the state's economy. = Twenty-first century = Seattle-Tacoma Box Company is based in Kent, Washington, with operations in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and Oregon. It serves agricultural, industrial, and seafood markets with packaging supplies, boxes, wood containers, bags, strapping, pallets, fuel pellets, portable moving and storage vaults, as well as seafood containers. Its subsidiaries, SeaCa Packaging (founded in 1991) and SeaCa Plastic Packaging (founded in 2014), are in operation in central California, New Hampshire and Arizona. SeaCa Plastic Packaging in Fowler, California, manufactures polypropylene corrugated cartons as a sustainable packaging replacement to wax corrugated. In 2019, the company built a new manufacturing location in Surprise, Arizona, with plans to create better packaging on a larger scale.

Metal Supermarkets‚Äô main headquarters are located in Mississauga, Ontario. The company's franchise locations spread across Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Currently, Metal Supermarkets operates 88 locations worldwide.  History  Metal Supermarkets was established in 1985 as a single location in Mississauga, Ontario. Its founder, William \\"Bill\\" Mair, wanted to address the demand for small quantities of metal that large metal warehouses could not satisfy, while providing efficient and reliable service. Therefore, Metal Supermarkets adopted a business model based on cut-to-size metals and no minimum order size. Metal Supermarkets began franchising in 1987 as the company did not have enough funds at the time to finance an expansion. Due to the franchise's success in Canada, stores were opened for the first time in the United Kingdom and in the United States in 1994 and 1995 respectively. In 2007, Metal Supermarkets acquired Metal Express, a metal distributor based in the United States. The company recently celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2015, and it continues to expand its operations. Metal Supermarkets currently operates 86 stores worldwide and also operates its own online store. Metal Products Metal Supermarkets sources many different kinds of metal including Alloy Bar, Aluminum, Cold Rolled Steel, Hot Rolled Steel, Stainless Steel, Brass, Copper, Tool Steel. Additionally, they source hard to find metals for customers with specific requests.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Four trauma programs authorized by the Affordable Care Act are reauthorized by this legislation. The leading cause of death for people are 1-44 is traumatic injury. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act would amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for trauma care programs through FY2019. The bill would require that not more than 50% of amounts remaining for a fiscal year after FY2014 (after allocation for administrative purposes or for improvement of emergency medical services in rural areas) be allocated for competitive grants to support pilot projects for emergency care and trauma systems. The bill would require the inclusion of standards and requirements of the American Burn Association in trauma care modifications of a state plan for providing emergency medical services. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 3, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4080 would amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize funding for public and private entities that provide trauma and emergency care services and for the administration of the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS). The bill would authorize the appropriation of $24 million a year for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would cost $101 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts. Pay-as- you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 25, 2014 by Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R, TX-26). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. The bill was reported (amended) on May 20, 2014 alongside House Report 113-459. The House voted on June 24, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion The Trauma Center Association of America (TCAA) supported the bill, calling it \\"vital legislation.\\" According to the TCAA, the bill would \\"reauthorize two important grant mechanisms, the Trauma Care Systems Planning Grants and the Regionalization of Emergency Care Systems. The first supports state and rural development of trauma systems and the second funds pilot projects to design, implement, and evaluate innovative models of regionalized emergency care.\\" The Emergency Nurses Association (ENA) supported the bill, lobbying in its favor during a week-long lobbying visit to Capitol hill May 6-12. The ENA lobbied for \\"$28 million in funding for these critical trauma and emergency medical service programs\\" to help \\"develop comprehensive trauma systems and prevent further trauma center closures.\\" According to the Trauma Center Association of America, there were at least 21 trauma centers that closed over the last decade and only eight states have what they would consider to be \\"fully developed trauma systems.\\" The Society of Trauma Nurses (STN) also advocated in favor of the bill, encouraging its members to persuade their representatives to co-sponsor the bill.

Saron was claimed to be the largest chapel in the Cynon Valley although Calvaria, Abercynon, Ebenezer, Trecynon and Siloa, Aberdare all had a similar capacity. Foundation and early history The history of the cause at Saron can be traced to meetings held from November 1846 at a house in Cardiff Road, Aberaman, where Thomas Jones, minister of Adulam, Merthyr Tydfil had come to live and keep a school. At this time, the village of Aberaman was at a very early stage in its development as an industrial centre and, as workers frequently migrated in and out of the area the membership of the nascent church fluctuated. Soon, however the house became too small and the congregation moved to the nearby Lamb and Flag. The premises were owned by one Thomas Howells, but the holding of meetings in a public house, although far from unusual in those days, led to a split among the members and the meetings reverted to the house of Thomas Jones. When he died in January 1848 the future of the church was uncertain. However, at this stage, the intervention of David Price, minister of Siloa, Aberdare was crucial in the formation of a permanent Independent church at Aberaman, which was inaugurated later in 1848. In 1849, Joshua Thomas of Bethlehem, Llangadog, accepted a call to minister the church and in that year, in the wake of a religious revival which coincided with a cholera outbreak in the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire valleys, around 120 new members were accepted at Saron. A new building was urgently required and, shortly afterwards land was leased at Abergwawr Farm from Dr James Lewis Roberts and Jennett Roberts and a chapel built which was consecrated in 1850. The building costs in 1849‚Äì50 were ¬£719. At this time there were 218 members at Saron. The Pastorate of John Davies, 1854‚Äì63 Once the cholera outbreak was over the membership at Saron declined as many of those who had sought religious solace when in fear of the disease now withdrew. In this atmosphere remaining members fell out amongst themselves, a number left for other churches and, ultimately, in August 1852, Joshua Thomas terminated his ministry at Saron. William Edwards, minister of Ebenezer, Trecynon, temporarily took on responsibility for Saron until a call was extended to the Rev John Davies of Llanelli, Breconshire, in June 1854. After some months' hesitation, Davies accepted and commenced his ministry in November of that year. The arrival of the new minister immediately revived the cause at Saron. Although a branch of Saron was opened at Moriah Aman, Cwmaman, leading to the transfer of 29 members the existing building was found to be too small and a decision was taken to extend the building. This took place in 1856 at a cost of ¬£220 to provide seating capacity for 900 people. This work cost ¬£953, and the church debt was ¬£1200, as the cost of building the original chapel had not been cleared. However, the debt was rapidly reduced, and in the early 1860s, the spacious Saron Hall was built behind the chapel at a cost of ¬£300, and by 1865 the debt was largely cleared. It was no small feat for an industrial community composed in the main of manual labourers to raise over ¬£2000 in little over fifteen years. Saron did benefit, however, from the religious revival of 1859‚Äì60, when some 50 new members were being admitted each month. During this time, members of Saron had a part to play in the formation of the Tabernacle English Congregational Church, Aberdare John Davies had been a success at Aberaman and, in June 1863, he received a call from the church at Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff, and he ended his ministry at Saron on 14 June 1863. Interior of Saron, Aberaman Later Nineteenth Century A further renovation took place in 1890 at a cost of ¬£1,600. R. Rowlands was minister from 1864 until 1891 and H.P. Jenkins from 1893 until 1922. Later history The longest serving minister at Saron was Glannant Jones who served for 42 years from 1931 until 1973. Heulwen Evans ALCM was the organist from 1960 until 2000. The chapel was well-maintained into the twenty- first century but eventually closed due to a dwindling congregation. It has since reopened as Saron Chapel, Independent Baptist Church. The first service was November 5, 2014 under the new pastor, an American missionary, Dr. B.J.

She was the 17th and youngest daughter of Shanqi, the 10th heir to the Prince Su peerage of the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty, which ended with the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Background Jin was born in L√ºshun in 1918, seven years after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Both her father and mother died when she was just four years old. She was raised by her three stepsisters after her parents' deaths. She lived in Japan as a student. However, Jin chose to move back to Beijing when she was nineteen years old to pursue a career as either a journalist or entertainer. She settled for a position with a Japanese firm instead. Jin's elder sister Yoshiko Kawashima was a Japanese spy who was executed by the Chinese Nationalist Government as a traitor in March 1948. Jin's elder brothers lost most of the Aisin Gioro family fortune in 1948 after the Chinese Civil War. The brothers fled to British Hong Kong, leaving Jin to take care of her six nieces and nephews, as well as Jin's own daughter and the family's elderly nanny. Nearly destitute, Jin sold most of the possessions in her family home. She also earned additional income by selling knitted jumpers and taking out loans. Jin opened her own restaurant specialising in Sichuan cuisine in 1952. She married Chinese artist Ma Wanli in 1953 (Jin was Ma's third wife). Jin left her restaurant around the time of her wedding and took a position with the country's central translation agency. In February 1958, Jin was arrested at her home and imprisoned, due solely to her being a descendant of the former imperial family. She remained in prison for 15 years, until her release as a forced farm labourer in 1973. She struggled for several years. In 1978, Jin wrote a letter to Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping pleading for a job. Deng gave her a new job soon after. During the 1980s, Jin began planning to create a Japanese language school in China. She and her second husband opened a school in Hebei in 1996. Jin died at a hospital in Beijing on May 26, 2014, at the age of 95.

DDM was initially designed to support record-oriented files; it was extended to support hierarchical directories, stream-oriented files, queues, and system command processing; it was further extended to be the base of IBM's Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA); and finally, it was extended to support data description and conversion. Defined in the period from 1980 to 1993, DDM specifies necessary components, messages, and protocols, all based on the principles of object-orientation. DDM is not, in itself, a piece of software; the implementation of DDM takes the form of client and server products. As an open architecture, products can implement subsets of DDM architecture and products can extend DDM to meet additional requirements. Taken together, DDM products implement a distributed file system. DDM Architecture in the media. Distributed applications The designers of distributed applications must determine the best placement of the application's programs and data in terms of the quantity and frequency of data to be transmitted, along with data management, security, and timeliness considerations. There are three client‚Äìserver models for the design of distributed applications: # File Transfer Protocol (FTP) copies or moves whole files or database tables to each client so they can be operated on locally. This model is appropriate for highly interactive applications, such as document and spreadsheet editors, where each client has a copy of the corresponding editor and the sharing of such documents is generally not a concern. # Thin client applications present the interface of an application to users while the computational parts of the application are centralized with the affected files or databases. Communication then consists of remote procedure calls between the thin clients and a server in which uniquely designed messages specify a procedure to be called, its associated parameters, and any returned values. # Fat client applications perform all application processing tasks on client systems, but data is centralized in a server so that it can be managed, so that it can be accessed by any authorized client application, so that all client applications work with up-to-date data, and so that only the records, stream sections, or database tables affected by an application are transmitted. Client application programs must be distributed to all clients that work with the centralized data. The DDM architecture was initially designed to support the fat client model of distributed applications; it also supports whole-file transfers. Benefits provided by DDM architecture The DDM architecture provides distributed applications with the following benefits: * Local/remote transparency. Application programs can be easily redirected from local data to remote data. Specialized programs that access and manage data in remote systems are not needed. * Reduced data redundancy. Data need be stored in only one location in a network. * Better security. By eliminating redundant copies of data, access to the data in a network can be better limited to authorized users. * Data integrity. Updates by concurrent local and remote users are not lost because of conflicts. * More timely information. Users of multiple computers in a network always have access to the most recent data. * Better resource management. The data storage and processing resources of a network of computers can be optimized. History DDM architecture is a set of specifications for messages and protocols that enable data distributed throughout a network of computers to be managed and accessed. =Initial efforts= IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA) was initially designed to enable the hierarchical connection of workstations to IBM mainframe computers. The communication networks available at the time were rigidly designed in terms of fixed connections between a mainframe and its suite of workstations, which were under the complete software control of the mainframe computer. Other communications between mainframes was also in terms of fixed connections used by software defined for specific purposes. As communication networks became more flexible and dynamic, generic peer-to-peer communications were desirable, in which a program on one computer could initiate and interact with a program on a different computer. When IBM's SNA Advanced Program to Program Communications (APPC) architecture was defined in the early 1980s, it was also apparent that APPC could be used to provide operating system services on remote computers. An SNA workgroup pursued this idea and outlined several possible distributed services, such as file services, printer services, and system console services, but was unable to initiate product development. APPC software was not yet available on mainframes and, more basically, mainframes were still viewed primarily as stand-alone systems. As a result, work on distributed services was suspended by the SNA work group. Members of the SNA work group from IBM's Rochester, Minnesota development laboratory were convinced that a business case existed for distributed services among the mid- range computer systems produced in Rochester. A primitive form of distributed file services, called Distributed Data File Facility (DDFF) had been implemented to connect the IBM System/3, IBM System/34, and IBM System/36 minicomputers. Further, the IBM System/36 and the IBM System/38 computers were being sold to customers in multiples and there was a clear need to enable, for example, the headquarters computers of a company to interact with the computers in its various warehouses. APPC was implemented on these systems and used by various customer applications. The idea of distributed operating system services was then revived as the Golden Gate project and an attempt made to justify its development. This attempt also failed; the whole idea of distributed services was too new for IBM product planners to be able to quantify the value of software that interconnected heterogeneous computers. However, one Golden Gate planner, John Bondy, remained convinced and persuaded management to create a department outside of the normal control of the Rochester laboratory so that there would be no immediate need for a predefined business case. Further, he narrowed its mission to include only support for Distributed Data Management (DDM), in particular, support for record-oriented files. He then convinced an experienced software architect, Richard A. Demers, to join him in the tasks of defining DDM architecture and selling the idea of DDM to the IBM system houses. The first year of this effort was largely fruitless as the IBM system houses continued to demand up-front business cases and as they insisted on message formats isomorphic to the control block interfaces of their local file systems. Further, as Personal Computers began to be used as terminals attached to mainframe computers, it was argued that simply enhancing the 3270 data stream would enable PCs to access mainframe data. During this period, Demers designed an architectural model of DDM clients and servers, of their components, and of interactions between communicating computers. Further, he defined a generic format for DDM messages based on the principles of object-orientation as pioneered by the Smalltalk programming language and by the IBM System/38. This model made it clear how DDM products could be implemented on various systems. See How DDM works. In 1982, the System/36 planners became convinced there was a sufficient market for DDM record-oriented file services. =DDM level 1: Record-oriented files= The generic format of DDM messages had already been designed, but what specific messages should be defined? The System/36 file system had been defined to meet the record-oriented needs of third generation programming languages (3GLs), such as Fortran, COBOL, PL/I, and IBM RPG, and so had the System/38 file system and the Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) file system of the IBM mainframe computers. And yet, their actual facilities and interfaces varied considerably, so what facilities and interfaces should DDM architecture support? See record-oriented files. The initial work on DDM by the Golden Gate project had followed the lead of the File Transfer Access and Management (FTAM) international standard for distributed files, but it was very abstract and difficult to map to local file services. In fact, this had been one of the barriers to acceptance by the IBM system houses. Kenneth Lawrence, the system architect responsible for System/36 file services, argued that it would be better to define messages that at least one IBM system could easily implement and then let other systems request whatever changes they needed. Naturally, he argued for support of System/36 requirements. After a year of failure to sell the idea of DDM to other IBM system houses, Lawrence's arguments prevailed. Richard Sanders joined the DDM architecture team and worked with Lawrence and Demers to define the specific messages needed for System/36 DDM. Progress in the definition of DDM encouraged System/38 to also participate. This broadened the scope of DDM record-file support to meet many of the requirements of the System/38's advanced file system. Files exist in a context provided by an operating system that provides services for organizing files, for sharing them with concurrent users and for securing them from unwarranted access. In level 1 of DDM, access to remote file directories was not supported beyond the transmission of the fully qualified name of the file to be used. Security and sharing, however, were required. Sanders did the design work in these areas. Sanders also defined specific protocols regarding the use of communication facilities, which were incorporated in a component called the DDM Conversational Communications Manager. Initially implemented using APPC, it was later implemented using TCP/IP. With the completion of the System/36 DDM product, Lawrence worked with programmers from the IBM Hursley Park, UK laboratory to adapt much of the System/36 DDM server programming for use in the IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS) transaction processing environment, thereby making CICS a DDM server for both the MVS and VSE mainframe operating systems. Lawrence also worked with programmers from the IBM Cary, North Carolina laboratory to implement a DDM record-oriented client for IBM PC DOS. Level 1 of DDM Architecture was formally published in 1986. At the time of this announcement, IBM presented an Outstanding Technical Achievement Award to Kenneth Lawrence, an Outstanding Contribution Award to Richard Sanders, and an Outstanding Innovation Award to Richard Demers. * In this article, System/38 will be henceforth used to refer to the System/38 and its successors: the IBM AS/400 (which merged the functionality of the System/36 and the System/38), the IBM iSeries, and the IBM Power Series (which merged the iSeries with the IBM RS/6000, IBM's RISC/UNIX-based server and workstation product line). =DDM level 2: Hierarchical directories and stream-oriented files= With the increasing importance of the IBM PC and the Unix operating system in network environments, DDM support was also needed for the hierarchical directories and stream-oriented files of the IBM Personal Computer running IBM PC DOS and the IBM RS/6000 running IBM AIX (IBM's version of Unix). See Stream-oriented files. DDM Architecture Level 2 was published in 1988. Jan Fisher and Sunil Gaitonde did most of the architecture work on DDM support for directories and stream files. =DDM level 3: Relational database services= In 1986, IBM marketed four different relational database (RDB) products, each built for a specific IBM operating system. Scientists at IBM's Almaden Research Laboratory had developed System/R*, a prototype of a distributed RDB and they felt it was now time to turn it into marketable products. However, System/R* was based on System/R, a research prototype of a RDB, and could not be easily added to the IBM RDB products. See for a discussion of RDBs in a distributed processing environment. Roger Reinsch from the IBM Santa Theresa Programming Center lead a cross-product team to define a Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA). He enlisted: * Representatives from each of the four IBM RDB products. * Bruce Lindsay, a System/R* researcher, * Paul Roever (from the IBM Sindelfingen, Germany laboratory), who had developed a specification for describing data called the Formatted Data: Object Content Architecture (FD:OCA). * Richard Sanders and Richard Demers from the DDM architecture team to define appropriate models, messages and protocols. In 1990, DDM Architecture Level 3 and DRDA were published at the same time. Both DDM and DRDA were designated as strategic components of IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA). DRDA was implemented by all four of the IBM RDB products and by other vendors. Awards were given to key participants in the design of DRDA. Richard Sanders received an Outstanding Contribution Award and Roger Reinsch and Richard Demers received Outstanding Innovation Awards. =DDM level 4: Additional Services= The Distributed File Management (DFM) project was initiated to add DDM services to IBM's MVS operating system to enable programs on remote computers to create, manage, and access VSAM files. John Hufferd, the manager of the DFM project looked to the DDM Architecture team for a means of converting the data fields in records as they flowed between systems. Richard Demers took the lead on this issue, aided by Koichi Yamaguchi from the DFM project. See Data description and conversion. The following additional services were defined by Richard Sanders, Jan Fisher and Sunil Gaitonde in DDM architecture at Level 4: * For DFM, storage management and user-defined file attributes. * For DRDA, two-phase commitment control protocols for application directed distributed units of work. * Queues, which can be created, cleared or deleted in a remote server. Queue entries are application defined records that are added to or received from a queue. See DDM Queues. * System Command Processor, a Manager to which commands defined by a server's host system, can be sent for execution. * Multi-tasking Communications Manager, which enables multiple client agents to communicate with corresponding server agents using a single conversation between the client and server systems. * Sync Point manager coordinates logical units of work in multiple DDM servers. Two-phase commitment protocols ensure coordinated resource recovery when any logical unit of work fails. DDM architecture level 4 was published in 1992. =DDM level 5: Library services= Architecture work on DDM level 5 consisted of support for * mainframe Partitioned Data Sets, which are files consisting of an internal directory and multiple members; in effect, they are libraries of similar files. * Personal Computer Libraries, which consolidate access to files in multiple folders in a single library. * further enhancements to DRDA. Jan Fisher was the architect responsible for DDM level 5, which was published by the Open Group, rather than IBM. Shortly thereafter, the IBM DDM architecture group was disbanded. Inside DDM DDM architecture is a formally defined and highly structured set of specifications. This section introduces key technical concepts that underlie DDM. =How DDM works= Overview of DDM Processing DDM architecture defines a client/server protocol; that is, a client requests services from a server which interacts with its local resources to perform the requested service, the results of which, data and status indicators, are returned to the client. The above diagram illustrates the roles of DDM clients and servers in relation to local resources. (The common terminology of clients and servers is used here, but in DDM architecture, a client is called a Source Server and a Server is called a Target Server.) # An application program interacts with a local resource, such as a file, by means of programming interfaces provided by a local resource manager (LRM). But if the desired resource is in a remote computer, DDM is used to mediate the interaction. The application program continues to use the interfaces provided by its LRM, but they are redirected to a DDM client. DDM architecture does not specify how this redirection is to occur as it does not support a directory of remote resources. One method of redirection used by several DDM file-oriented products is to have the application open a special local file, called a DDM File by the System/38, that provides location and access information about the remote file. Redirection to the DDM Client then occurs. # DDM Architecture defines Manager level entities for files, relational databases, access methods, etc. A Client Resource Manager (CRM) polymorphically supports the functional interfaces defined by the client system's LRM. Its primary function is to generate appropriate linearized DDM command and data objects for each functional interface. (See DDM messages.) These objects are sent to the server resource manager (SRM) of the remote DDM server. Actually, though, they are routed through DDM client and server Agents and Communications Managers. # The DDM Client Agent puts a linearized command into an RQSDSS envelope and linearized objects into linked OBJDSS envelopes. (See DDM messages.) The Client Agent interacts with the Server Agent to create a path for the messages it receives from the CRM to flow to the SRM. If the application program needs to interact with only a single remote resource, this is straightforward. However, it is possible for the application program to concurrently interact with multiple resources of varying kinds that reside on multiple remote systems. The Client Agent represents the application program in all cases and routes messages on separate virtual paths to each resource. # The Client Communications Manager interacts with the ServerCommunications Manager to implement a conversational protocol of the form \\"I talk while you listen, and then you talk while I listen.\\" Various telecommunication protocols can be used, including IBM's SNA APPC and the Internet's TCP/IP protocol. # DDM messages transmitted to the Server Communications Manager are passed to the Server Agent on the path specified by the message, and it forwards the messages to the SRM on the same path. If the Server Agent is interacting with a single client on a single path, this is straightforward. However, the Server Agent can interact with multiple clients on multiple paths. # The Server Resource Manager (SRM) parses DDM messages and determines what it must do to perform the request. It may use one or more of the functional interfaces of the server system's corresponding Local Resource Manager (LRM). # The SRM accumulates the data and status indicators from the LRM and generates appropriate linearized objects and reply messages, which it passes to the Server Agent. # The Server Agent packages the replies and objects into RPYDSS and OBJDSS envelopes and forwards them to the Server Communication Manager, which sends them to the Client Communication Manager and the Client Agent on the same path as the original command. # The Client Agent removes the reply and objects from their respective RPYDSS and OBJDSS envelopes and passes them to the Client Resource Manager. # The Client Resource Manager parses the returned object and reply messages and maps them as expected by the original LRM's functional interface for return to the application program. =Object- orientation= DDM architecture is object-oriented. All entities defined by DDM are objects defined by self-defining Class objects. The messages, replies and data that flow between systems are serialized objects. Each object specifies its length, identifies its class by means of a DDM codepoint, and contains data as defined by its class. Further, its class specifies the commands that can be sent to its instances when an object resides in a DDM client or server, thereby encapsulating the object by a limited set of operations. Structurally, DDM architecture consists of hierarchical levels of objects, each level manifesting emergent properties at increasingly higher levels. * A field is a string of bits that encodes a number, character or other data entity. Instances of a Field subclass are encapsulated by the operations that can be performed by its class; for example, arithmetic operations on integer fields. * An object is a self-identifying entity consisting of one or more fields encapsulated by a defined set of operations. Objects at this level were inspired by the kernel object classes of the Smalltalk programming language ** A scalar object consists of a single field, as encoded and described by the object's class. Scalar objects are used as the parameter values of command and reply objects. They are also used as the values of object attributes, such as an object's length in DDM documentation. The encoding methods used for the values of these scalar objects are fully defined by DDM architecture. ** A mapped object consists of one or more fields, such as the fields of an application defined record. The encoding methods and the alignment of these fields is not defined by DDM architecture; instead, it is defined by application program declaration statements and the encoding and alignment methods of its programming language. ** A collection object is a container for objects, as defined by the collection's class. Examples of collection objects are DDM Commands and Replies. * A manager is a self-identifying entity that provides an environment for the storage and processing of objects. A manager is encapsulated by the operations defined by its class. Together, a set of managers implements the overall processing environment of a DDM client or server. Manager entities at this level were inspired by the System Objects of the System/38 operating system. The Managers defined by DDM include: Dictionary, Supervisor, Agent, Directory, File(s), Access Method(s), Relational Database, SQL Application Manager, Queue, Lock Manager, Security Manager, Recovery Manager, System Command Processor, Communication Manager(s). * A server is a self-identifying entity that provides an environment for storage and processing of managers, as either a client or a server, in a distributed processing environment. Examples are clients and servers specialized for distributed file or distributed relational database management. While DDM architecture is object-oriented, the DDM products were implemented using the languages and methods typical of their host systems. A Smalltalk version of DDM was developed for the IBM PC by Object Technology International, with appropriate Smalltalk classes automatically created from the DDM Reference Manual. =Subsets and extensions= DDM is an open architecture. DDM products can implement subsets of DDM architecture; they can also create their own extensions. The DDM 'Exchange Server Attributes' command is the first command sent when a client is connected with a server. It identifies the client and specifies the managers the client requires and the level of DDM architecture at which support is required. The server responds by identifying itself and specifying at what level it supports the requested managers. A general rule is that a product that supports Level X of a DDM manager must also support Level X-1 so that new server products connect with older client products. Subsets of DDM can be implemented to meet varying product requirements: * as a client, a server or both. For example, DDM/PC is only a client, CICS/DDM is only a server, and System/38 DDM is both a client and a server. * to support specific managers, such as record-oriented files, stream-oriented files, relational databases (as part of DRDA), or any combination thereof. For example, MVS Database 2 provides client and server support for only the subset of DDM required by DRDA. * to support only selected commands of a manager, such as the ability to load and unload records from a sequential file. * to support selected parameters of a command, such as the 'Return Inactive Records' parameter of the 'Get Record' command. When a DDM client is connected to a known DDM server, such as a System/38 client to a System/38 server, DDM architecture can also be extended by adding * new product-specific managers. * new commands to an existing DDM manager. * new parameters to a DDM command or reply message. Such extensions can be defined within DDM's object-oriented framework so that existing DDM message handling facilities can be used. =DDM messages= In a purely object-oriented implementation of DDM, clients and servers and all of their contained managers and objects exist in a memory heap, with pointers (memory addresses) used to interconnect them. For example, a command object points to each of its parameter objects. But a command cannot be transmitted from a client to a server in this way; an isomorphic copy of the command must be created as a single, contiguous string of bits. In the heap, a command consists of the size of the command in the heap, a pointer to the command's class, and pointers to each of the command's parameter objects. Linearized, the command consists of the total length of the linearized command, a code point identifying the command's class, and each of its linearized parameter objects. DDM architecture assigns unique code points to each class of object. This straightforward technique is used for all objects transmitted between client's and servers, including commands, records, and reply messages. All of these linearized objects are put into envelopes that enable the client and server agents to coordinate their processing. In DDM architecture, these envelopes are called Data Stream Structures (DSS). Commands are put into a Request DSS (RQSDSS), replies are put into a Reply DSS (RPYDSS), and other objects are put into an Object DSS (OBJDSS). There can be only one command in a RQSDSS and only one reply in RPYDSS, but many objects, such as records, can be put into an OBJDSS. Further many OBJDSSes can be chained to a RQSDSS or a PRYDSS to accommodate as many objects as necessary. A DSS consists of the total length of the DSS, a flag byte identifying the type of DSS, a request identifier, and the linearized objects in the DSS. The request identifier ties an RQSDSS with subsequent OBJDSSes from the client, such as the records to be loaded into a file by the Load File command. The request identifier also ties the RQSDSS from the client with a RPYDSS or the OBJDSSes from the server to the client. =Documentation= The DDM Reference Manual consists of named Menu, Help, and Class objects. The subclasses of DDM class Class are described by variables that specify * the superclass of the class. Classes are defined by an inheritance hierarchy; for example, Record File is a subclass of File which is a subclass of Manager and inherits their data and commands. Class √álass and its subclasses are self-describing by √ßlass commands and class variables, including: * a title that briefly describes the class. * the status of the class relative to ongoing work on DDM architecture. * descriptive text and graphics relating the class to its components and its environment. * the data (Fields, Objects, Managers, etc.) encapsulated by instances of the class. * the commands that can be sent to its instances. These objects can contain references to other named objects in text and specifications, thereby creating hypertext linkages among the pages of the DDM Reference Manual. Menu and Help pages form an integrated tutorial about DDM. The paper version of the DDM Reference Manual Level 3 is bulky, at over 1400 pages, and somewhat awkward to use, but an interactive version was also built using internal IBM communication facilities. Given the relatively slow speed of those communication facilities, it was primarily of use within the IBM Rochester laboratory. In addition to the DDM Reference Manual, a General Information document provide's executive level information about DDM, and a Programmer's Guide summarizes DDM concepts for programmers implementing clients and servers. =DDM file models= Three general file models are defined by DDM architecture: record-oriented files, stream-oriented files and hierarchical directories. The following services are provided by DDM architecture for managing remote files: * creating, clearing, and deleting files, * copying, loading, and unloading the data of a file, * locking and unlocking files, * obtaining and changing file attributes, Record-oriented files Record-oriented files were designed to meet the data input, output, and storage requirements of third generation (3GL) programming languages, such as Fortran, Cobol, PL/I, and RPG. Rather than have each language provide its own support for these capabilities, they were incorporated into services provided by operating systems. A record is a series of related data fields, such as the name, address, identification number and salary of a single employee, in which each field is encoded and mapped to a contiguous string of bytes. Early computers had limited input and output capabilities, typically in the form of stacks of 80 column punched cards or in the form of paper or magnetic tapes. Application records, such as employee data records, were sequentially read or written a record at a time and processed in batches. When direct access storage devices became available, programming languages added ways for programs to randomly access records one at a time, such as access by the values of key fields or by the position of a record in a file. All of the records in a file can be of the same format (as in a payroll file) or of varying formats (as in an event log). Some files are read-only in that their records, once written to the file, can only be read, while other files allow their records to be updated. The DDM record-oriented file models consist of file attributes, such as its creation date, the date of last update, the size of its records, and slots in which records can be stored. The records can be of either fixed or varying length, depending on the media used to store the file's records. DDM defines four kinds of record-oriented files: * Sequential files, in which records are stored in consecutive slots. * Direct files, in which individual records are stored in a slot of the file determined by the value of a field of the records. * Keyed files, in which records are stored in consecutive slots and for which a secondary order is maintained by means of an index of the values of key fields contained in the records. * Alternate index files, in which a separate index of the values of key fields is based on an existing sequential, direct, or keyed file. DDM architecture also defines a variety of access methods for working with record-oriented files in various ways. An access method is an instance of the use of a file created by means of an OPEN command that connects itself to the file after determining if the client is authorized to use it. The access method is disconnected from a file by means of a CLOSE command. An access method keeps track of the record being currently processed by means of a cursor. Using various SET commands, the cursor can be made to point to the beginning or end of the file, to the next or previous sequential record of the file, to the record with a specific key value, or to the next or previous record as ordered by their keys. Multiple instances of access methods can be opened on a file at the same time, each serving a single client. If a file is opened for update access, conflicts can occur when the same record is being accessed by multiple clients. To prevent such conflicts, a lock can be obtained on an entire file. Also, if a file is opened for update a lock is obtained on a record by the first client to read it and released when that client updates it. All other clients must wait for the lock's release. Stream-oriented files Stream-oriented files consist of a single sequence of bytes on which programs can map application data however they want. Stream files are the primary file model supported by Unix and Unix-like operating systems and by Windows. DDM defines a single stream file model and a single stream access method. The DDM stream file model consists of file attributes, such as its creation date and the size of the stream and a continuous stream of bytes. The stream can be accessed by means of the Stream Access Method. Application programs write data onto portions of the stream, even if that data consists of records. They keep track of the location of data items in the stream in any way they want. For example, the data stream of document files is defined by a text processing program such as Microsoft Word and that of a spreadsheet file by a program such as Microsoft Excel. A Stream access method is an instance of use of a stream file by a single client. A cursor keeps track of the position of the current byte of the sub-stream in use by the client. Using various SET commands, the cursor can be made to point to the beginning or end of the file, to any specific position in the file, or to any positive or negative offset from the current position. Multiple instances of the Stream access method can be opened on a file at the same time, each serving a single client. If a file is opened for \\"update\\" access, conflicts can occur when the same sub-stream is being accessed by multiple clients. To prevent such conflicts, a lock can be obtained on an entire file. Also, if a file is opened for update a lock is obtained on a sub- stream by the first client to \\"read\\" it and released when that client \\"updates\\" it. All other clients must wait for the lock's release. Hierarchical directories Hierarchical directories are files whose records each associate a name with a location. A hierarchy occurs when a directory record identifies the name and location of another directory. Using DDM client and server products, a program can create, delete and rename directories in a remote computer. They can also list and change the file attributes of remote directories. The records in a directory can be sequentially read by using the DDM Directory Access Method. The files identified by directory records can be renamed, copied, and moved to a different directory. =DDM queues= Queues are a communication mechanism that enables generally short term communication among programs by means of records. A DDM queue resides in a single system, but it can be accessed by programs on multiple systems. There are three subclasses of DDM queues that can be created on a target system by means of distinct creation commands: * First-in-first-out queues, an asynchronous pipe between enqueuing and dequeuing programs. * Last-in-first-out queues, a pushdown stack. * Keyed queues, a fan-out mechanism where selected entries can be dequeued by key value. The DDM queue model consists of queue attributes, such as its creation date, the number of records the queue can contain, and the length of the records. The records in a queue can be either fixed or varying length. Unlike the DDM file models, it is not necessary to open an access method on a queue. Programs can add records to a queue and receive records from a queue as determined by the class of the queue. Programs can also clear records from a queue, stop operations on a queue, list the attributes of a queue, and change the attributes of a queue. Programs can also lock a queue or individual records in a queue to inhibit contention from other programs. All other clients must wait for the lock's release. =Relational databases= A relational database (RDB) is an implementation of the Structured Query Language (SQL) that supports the creation, management, querying, updating, indexing and interrelationships of tables of data. An interactive user or program can issue SQL statements to a RDB and receive tables of data and status indicators in reply. However, SQL statements can also be compiled and stored in the RDB as packages and then invoked by package name. This is important for the efficient operation of application programs that issue complex, high-frequency queries. It is especially important when the tables to be accessed are located in remote systems. The Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) fits nicely into the overall DDM framework, as discussed in Object-Orientation. (However, DDM can also be viewed as a component architecture of DRDA since other specifications are also required ). The DDM manager-level objects supporting DRDA are named RDB (for relational database) and SQLAM (for SQL Application Manager). =Data description and conversion= Transparency is a key objective of DDM architecture. Without recompilation, it should be possible to redirect existing application programs to the data management services of a remote computer. For files, this was largely accomplished by DDM clients at the interface/functional level, but what about the data fields in a record? Complete transparency requires that client application programs be able to write and read fields as encoded by their local data management system, regardless of how any remote server encodes them, and that implies automatic data conversions. For example, IBM mainframe computers encode floating point numbers in hexadecimal format and character data in EBCDIC, while IBM Personal computers encode them in IEEE format and ASCII. Further complexity arose because of the ways in which various programming language compilers map record fields onto strings of bits, bytes, and words in memory. Transparent conversion of a record requires detailed descriptions of both the client view and the server view of a record. Given these descriptions, the fields of the client and server views can be matched, by field name, and appropriate conversions can be performed. The key issue is obtaining sufficiently detailed record descriptions, but record descriptions are generally specified abstractly in application programs by declaration statements defined by the programming language, with the language compiler handling encoding and mapping details. In a distributed processing environment, what is needed is a single, standardized way of describing records that is independent of all programming languages, one that can describe the wide variety of fixed and varying length record formats found in existing files. The result was the definition of a comprehensive Data Description and Conversion architecture (DD&C;), based on a new, specialized programming language, A Data Language (ADL), for describing client and server views of data records and for specifying conversions. Compiled ADL programs can then be called by a server to perform necessary conversions as records flowed to or from the server. DD&C; architecture went further and defined a means by which programming language declaration statements can be automatically converted to and from ADL, and thus from one programming language to another. This capability was never implemented because of its complexity and cost. However, an ADL compiler was created and ADL programs are called, when available, to perform conversions by DFM and by the IBM 4680 Store System. However, it is necessary for application programmers to manually write the ADL programs.

Bross (November 4, 1813 ‚Äì January 27, 1890) was an American politician and publisher originally from the New Jersey‚ÄìNew York‚ÄìPennsylvania tri-state area. He was also elected as the 16th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois. He engaged in the lumber trade with his father before attending Williams College. He taught at schools for ten years, then headed west to Chicago, Illinois. He engaged in book-selling and publishing interests before co-founding the successful Democratic Press paper. Following the organization of the Republican Party in 1854, Bross became a staunch supporter of its political candidates. His support for Abraham Lincoln helped him win support for a bid as Lieutenant Governor. In 1865, he accompanied future Vice President of the United States Schuyler Colfax on a trip west to California, later publishing a book about the excursion. Biography William Bross was born on November 4, 1813, in northwest Sussex County, New Jersey. He was the eldest of eleven children of Deacon Moses Bross and Jane (Winfield) Bross. He was the eldest because he was born a few minutes before his twin Stephen Decatur Bross. When they were nine, the family moved to Milford, Pennsylvania in anticipation of the construction of the Delaware and Hudson Canal. The boys worked with their father to furnish lumber for the canal near Shohola. In 1832, Bross enrolled at Milford Academy, then attended Williams College, rooming with his twin brother. William Bross was one of the founding members of The Social Fraternity at Williams, forerunner to Delta Upsilon. Shortly after graduating in 1838, he became the principal of Ridgebury Academy in Ridgebury, New York. In 1843, he began to teach at a school in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he worked for another five years. Starting in 1846, Bross took trips west to identify a better place to settle. He decided on the emerging city of Chicago, Illinois, which he reached on May 12, 1848. Bross quickly formed a partnership with S. C. Griggs and the Newman & Co. publishing house, opening the book-selling firm of Griggs, Bross & Co. The partnership dissolved eighteen months later. In the autumn of 1849, Bross co-published the Prairie Herald, a religious newspaper, with Rev. J. A. Wright. Bross first achieved prosperity in 1852 when he teamed with Chicago postmaster John L. Scripps to start the Democratic Press. The paper espoused Democratic viewpoints, but differed from the party line regarding slavery, notably opposing Stephen A. Douglas's Missouri Compromise. When the Republican Party formed in 1854, Bross became a public speaker on behalf of the cause. He gave the first public endorsement of John C. Fr√©mont for President in the West, speaking at Dearborn Park the night he was nominated. Bross toured southern Illinois, generally a pro-slavery area, to extoll the virtues of Fr√©mont. While at the former State House in Vandalia, Illinois, he became acquainted with fellow Fr√©mont campaigner Abraham Lincoln and the two would often speak at the same engagements. In 1855, Bross was elected to the Chicago City Council, serving for two years. The Democratic Press struggled financially after the Panic of 1857. On July 1, 1858, the paper was merged into the Tribune, creating The Press and Tribune. Bross advocated for Abraham Lincoln for President following his nomination. Following the outbreak of the Civil War, in 1863 Bross helped to raise the 29th Regiment, United States Colored Infantry. It was commanded by one of his brothers, Col. John A. Bross, who was killed on July 30, 1864 during the Siege of Petersburg. Bross's support of Lincoln helped him to gain nomination as the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois under Richard J. Oglesby. He traveled with Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Schuyler Colfax in 1865 to examine the path west to California. two years later he traveled to Europe with his daughter. =Personal life= Soon after graduating from college and gaining his first job, in 1839 Bross married Mary Jane Jansen, the daughter of Dr. John T. Jansen. They had four sons and four daughters, but only one child, Jessie, survived to adulthood. Their daughter Jessie Bross married Henry Demarest Lloyd, known as a muckraking journalist. Grandson William Bross Lloyd was a founding members of the Communist Labor Party of America. In 1879, Bross established the Bross Foundation at Lake Forest University in memory of his son Nathaniel. He donated $40,000 to invest over ten years to buy literature \\"on the connection, relation, and mutual bearing of any practical science, the history of our race, or the facts in any department of knowledge, with and upon the Christian Religion.\\" University trustees offered $6,000 as a prize to one who would author a book best fulfilling these conditions; it was won by James Orr of United Free Church College for Problems of the Old Testament Considered with Reference to Recent Criticism. The fund also enabled the university to pay for lecturers, who included Francis Landey Patton, Marcus Dods, John Arthur Thomson, Frederick J. Bliss, and Josiah Royce. Bross died in Chicago on January 27, 1890 and was buried in Rosehill Cemetery.

Cyclic Corrosion Testing (CCT) has evolved in recent years, largely within the automotive industry, as a way of accelerating real-world corrosion failures, under laboratory controlled conditions. As the name implies, the test comprises different climates which are cycled automatically so the samples under test undergo the same sort of changing environment that would be encountered in the natural world. The intention being to bring about the type of failure that might occur naturally, but more quickly i.e. accelerated. By doing this manufacturers and suppliers can predict, more accurately, the service life expectancy of their products. Until the development of Cyclic Corrosion Testing, the traditional Salt spray test was virtually all that manufacturers could use for this purpose. However, this test was never intended for this purpose. Because the test conditions specified for salt spray testing are not typical of a naturally occurring environment, this type of test cannot be used as a reliable means of predicting the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô service life expectancy for the samples under test. The sole purpose of the salt spray test is to compare and contrast results with previous experience to perform a quality audit. So, for example, a spray test can be used to ‚Äòpolice‚Äô a production process and forewarn of potential manufacturing problems or defects, which might affect corrosion resistance. . To recreate these different environments within an environmental chamber requires much more flexible testing procedures than are available in a standard salt spray chamber. The lack of correlation between results obtained from traditional salt spray testing and the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô atmospheric corrosion of vehicles, left the automotive industry without a reliable test method for predicting the service life expectancy of their products. This was and remains of particular concern in an industry where anti-corrosion warranties have been gradually increasing and now run to several years for new vehicles. With ever increasing consumer pressure for improved vehicle corrosion resistance and a few ‚Äòhigh profile‚Äô corrosion failures amongst some vehicle manufactures ‚Äì with disastrous commercial consequences, the automotive industry recognized the need for a different type of corrosion test. Such a test would need to simulate the types of conditions a vehicle might encounter naturally, but recreate and accelerate these conditions, with good repeatability, within the convenience of the laboratory. CCT is effective for evaluating a variety of corrosion types, including galvanic corrosion and crevice corrosion. Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during cyclic corrosion test VDA 621-415  Test Stages  Taking results gathered largely from ‚Äòreal world‚Äô exposure sites, automotive companies, led originally by the Japanese automobile industry, developed their own Cyclic Corrosion Tests. These have evolved in different ways for different vehicle manufacturers, and such tests still remain largely industry specific, with no truly international CCT standard. However, they all generally require most of the following conditions to be created, in a repeating sequence or ‚Äòcycle‚Äô, though not necessarily in the following order: ‚Ä¢ A salt spray ‚Äòpollution‚Äô phase. This may be similar to the traditional salt spray test although in some cases direct impingement by the salt solution on the test specimens, or even complete immersion in salt water, is required. However, this ‚Äòpollution‚Äô phase is generally shorter in duration than a traditional salt spray test. Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during cyclic corrosion test D17 2028 ECC1 ‚Ä¢ An air drying phase. Depending on the test, this may be conducted at ambient temperature, or at an elevated temperature, with or without control over the relative humidity and usually by introducing a continuous supply of relatively fresh air around the test samples at the same time. It is generally required that the samples under test should be visibly ‚Äòdry‚Äô at the end of this test phase. Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during cyclic corrosion test CETP 00.00-L-467 ‚Ä¢ A condensation humidity ‚Äòwetting‚Äô phase. This is usually conducted at an elevated temperature and generally a high humidity of 95-100%RH. The purpose of this phase is to promote the formation of condensation on the surfaces of the samples under test. ‚Ä¢ A controlled humidity/humidity cycling phase. This requires the tests samples to be exposed to a controlled temperature and controlled humidity climate, which can either be constant or cycling between different levels. When cycling between different levels, the rate of change may also be specified. The above list is not exhaustive, since some automotive companies may also require other climates to be created in sequence as well, for example; sub-zero refrigeration, but it does list the most common requirements.

Members Damien Drea, Peter Forde, Keith Forde, Rod Smith, Shane Lee Background The band released three singles, Blue Mirror Boy (2006) which was produced by Crowded House bass player Nick Seymour, Pyramid Clocks (2007) and Weighted Love (2007). Blue Mirror Boy reached number 33 and Pyramid Clocks reached number 36 on the Official Irish Charts. Their album Exit Here, which was recorded in Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin and produced by Richard Rainey, was released in June 2007 on Eavesdrop Music. The band toured in Ireland, the UK and North America and shared a stage with the likes of Editors, The Wonderstuff, Sultans of Ping and Ocean Colour Scene. They were named as 'Best Band' at the prestigious 'Indie Week' festival in Toronto, the 'Best New Musical Artist' at the MAMCA awards and \\"ones to watch\\" by the NME. The band's songs appeared on various compilation albums in the USA, Australia, Germany, Canada and Ireland. Four of their songs were licensed to the American TV Network CBS. The band broke up in 2009. Indie Week Connection In 2007 over 100 bands travelled to Toronto, Ontario to take part in a week-long music festival called Indie Week. The first and only Irish band to make the trip were Vesta Varro. The Limerick five piece took Toronto by storm and won the festival. They returned to Canada four times the following year to play sell out shows across Toronto while their debut album 'Exit Here' peaked at number 3 on the college radio chart and their music videos were put on heavy rotation on Canada's biggest music station MUCH Music. All this attention sparked an interest in Irish bands applying to the festival the following year. The band became good friends with Indie Week founder and director Darryl Hurs and between them they set up INDIE WEEK Ireland in 2008.

He studied music theory and computer music with Peter Swinnen at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels and composition with Carl-Axel Hall in the Musikh√∂gskolan (sv) of Gothenborg. He later studied film scoring at the University of Gothenburg, and scriptwriting at the film school, now the . He studied with George Aperghis who encouraged him to compose theatrical music in the style of Mauricio Kagel. In 2003, Hosseini founded the Gothenburg Music & Dance Company (GMDC), which in 2007 transformed into the Ensemble Themus in Gothenburg with a mission to popularize the concept of theatrical music by allowing actors and musicians to swap and intermingle their roles. His work in the field is inspired by modern dance, theatre and martial arts. Hosseini has a great interest in improvisation both as a composer and performer. He sometimes adds sections to his compositions which are marked to let the musicians know that they can improvise in a controlled and measured way. He has been a lecturer in musical notation, composition, communication between musicians and composers, and the comprehension of musical notation for musicians. He was awarded prizes, including the culture prizes of Gothenborg and of the V√§stra G√∂taland.  Works  Hosseini's duo Bones (second piece) for piano and cello was composed in 1998, described as a race of the two instruments, with \\"buddhistic cluster sounds\\" in the piano and \\"roaring three- notes\\" in the cello that \\"float and combine like dream sequence\\". His string quartet Esfand II was premiered at the Sibelius Museum (fi) in Turku in 2011, when the town was a European Capital of Culture. His composition Bright Blue Bird, In A Grey Red Sky for violin and orchestra was premiered on 22 June 2014 at the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche in Munich by the Nymphenburger Kammerorchester with Henja Semmler as the violinist and Manuel Nawri conducting. The work is based on a Persian legend about the mythical bird Simurgh. A thousand birds travel to find his feather (and enlightenment), but after a hard journey only 30 of them reach the destination, which turns out to be a lake reflecting their image.

The species is endemic to Madagascar. It was named after the British poet and herpetologist Arthur O'Shaughnessy.Calumma oshaughnessyi  The Reptile DatabaseBeolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Calumma oshaughnessyi, p. 197). Distribution and habitat O'Shaughnessy's chameleon has a geographic range of about 18,000 square kilometers (6,950 square miles) throughout the southeastern portion of the central highlands of Madagascar. Its distribution extends from Tsinjoarivo, Ambatolampy in the north to Andohahela National Park in the south. The species is highly dependent on intact, humid forest as its habitat, living in lower densities on selectively logged territories.Calumma oshaughnessyi (O'Shaughnessy's Chameleon) at The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Description O'Shaughnessy's chameleon, being closely related to Parson's chameleon, is similar in shape and color but slightly smaller. Albert G√ºnther, the first to scientifically describe the species, stated that the type specimen is a male measuring 15.5 inches (39.4 cm) in total length, including its tail which is 9 inches (22.9 cm) long. It is mostly brownish gray, with a darker throat and jaw.G√ºnther A (1881). \\"Seventh Contribution to the Knowledge of the Fauna of Madagascar\\". Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Fifth Series 7: 357-360. (\\"Cham√¶leon O'Shaughnessii \\", new species, p. 358). (at Biodiversity Heritage Library). Although lacking horns, the male of the species has a short, bony structure on the snout. The female does not have this structure. Behavior During a 1997 study, researchers discovered that adult O'Shaughnessy's chameleons are most active in the morning and the evening. Conservation and threats Although in some places common, O'Shaughnessy's chameleon is severely threatened. Its populations are declining and fragmented, and the species is ranked as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Although reports of illegal trade in the species do exist, its primary threat is habitat loss, such as logging and deforestation. While significant populations do exist in protected areas, further loss of inhabitable terrain could fragment and isolate these communities.

Named after the city of Lexington, the geologic formation has heavily influenced both the surface topography and economy of the region. It overlies the approximately Middle to Late Ordovician High Bridge Group, which is only exposed in some valleys of the Kentucky River, and underlies the Clays Ferry Formation. Since the time of its deposition spans several million years which were accompanied by constant sea level and topographical changes, the lithology of the Lexington Limestone varies significantly with geographic location and stratigraphic position within the rock column. Due to this, it is divided into 11 sub-units which sometimes complexly grade into and intertongue with each other. The formation is largely composed of limestone, however shale is also usually present in varying amounts, and in some sub-units is dominant.  Geological setting  Around 450 million years ago, during the Late Ordovician period, much of what is now eastern Kentucky was a shallow, tropical carbonate platform located on the southern fringes of Laurentia since the craton was rotated around 45 degrees clockwise compared to its modern position. As a result of the ongoing Taconic orogeny, the region was cut off from the mainland by the deep Sebree trough. The trough served as a passage for cold, nutrient-rich oceanic water from the Iapetus ocean, which would mix with the warm surface waters of the surrounding carbonate platforms, enabling a large number of bryozoan-brachiopod-echinoderm patch reefs to develop throughout the area. Hence, several parts of the Lexington Limestone are characteristically rich in fossil content. In preceding periods, particularly during the deposition of the Tyrone Limestone, most of the region was covered in tidal mudflats due to low sea levels. The lower parts of the Lexington Limestone, the Curdsville and Logana members, are characterized by the continuous encroachment of the sea onto the vast tidal flats, culminating in a period where much of the platform was too deep for an adequate supply of oxygen to be retained or for photosynthesis to be performed effectively. Eventually, however, water levels began to fall, and a plethora of ecological environments emerged, ranging from extremely shallow and turbulent sandbars, through mid-depth waters highly suitable for patch reef development, to dark, anoxic depressions in the terrain. Each of these environments facilitated the deposition of distinct facies of varying lithological characters. Due to the lack of significant sources of terrigenous sediments, most sedimentary material was supplied through carbonate production of the local ecosystem.  Subdivisions  = Curdsville Limestone = The Curdsville Limestone Member is the oldest and lowermost member of the Lexington formation. It was deposited as the sea level rose and transgressed across the tidal flats that dominated the region during the deposition of the preceding Tyrone Limestone. It is predominately composed of calcarenite initially deposited in turbulent, shallow water, but as the water column deepened, grain sizes became increasingly smaller. Due to heavy wave action, most organic debris in the lower part of the formation was broken up and heavily altered, making fossils rare and of poor quality. However, due to calmer conditions, fossils become more common in the upper parts of the member, when the water was not deep enough to be anoxic, but too deep for most wave-action. Whole and broken silicified fossils of brachiopods and gastropods are known, along with the occasional bivalve or trilobite. = Logana Member = The Logana Member was deposited during the time when the earlier deepening trend of the sea level reached its apex. It consists of an alternation of fine limestone and shale, with winnowed organic debris periodically arriving from shallower waters and covering a terrigenous, muddy substrate that continuously accumulated in the deep waters. The water level was normally too deep to provide an adequate supply of oxygen, hence fossils are rare, and mostly restricted to Cryptolithus trilobites(which are characteristic of deep-water environments). However, periodic improvements to the oxygen supply of the area resulted in the formation of shell beds when brachiopods of the species Dalmanella sulcata were able to gain a foothold. During longer periods of nondeposition, more complex ecological communities could form, as evidenced by the presence of limestones that progress upwards from low-diversity, whole fossil packstones to high-diversity grainstones. Due to the region's topographical height compared to the surrounding landscape at the time, the Logana Member is absent around and southeast of Winchester since the area did not reach depths required for the shale's deposition. On the other hand, the member continuously thickens northward and westward as it approaches the deep waters of the former Sebree trough. = Grier Member = As sea levels began to fall, oxygen levels normalized throughout the platform, leading to a boom in biodiversity. Much of the Grier Member was deposited in waters with little wave action, so unabraded fossils of bryozoans and brachiopods are exceedingly abundant. Crinoids were also very common during the time of deposition, but few are preserved as complete fossils. The presence of gastropods with lime mud indicates that the environment was also highly rich in algae, while the lenticular and nodular structure of some beds point to an abundance of soft- bodied burrowing organisms which have not been fossilized. Rocks of the Grier Member also have an unusually high phosphate concentration - this was most likely due to the influx of nutrient-rich cold waters from the Sebree trough northwest, which was also a reason for the abundance of fauna throughout the member. = Tanglewood Member = The relative topographical uniformness of the region was disrupted after two linear horst-like blocks were uplifted around a central graben structure south of Versailles, Kentucky as a result of Taconic tectonism. Owing to their shallower depth compared to the surrounding landscape, tidal currents began to cause accretions of bioclastic debris to form on top of them, giving rise to two major shoal complexes. These sandbars are today preserved as the Tanglewood Member - a complex formation of well- sorted limestone that makes up the bulk of the Lexington Limestone in the inner Bluegrass region. Most of the debris that makes up the Tanglewood member represents the broken and abraded fragments of locally abundant calcified animals, mainly crinoids, brachiopods, bryozoans and ostracodes. Fragments of the bryozoan Constellaria teres, which was very common throughout the Lexington platform in general during the time period, constitute a substantial portion of the bioclastic material. In particular, where the Tanglewood member grades into the overlying Devils Hollow member, relatively intact thickets of C. teres and other bryozoans occur, in the so-called Constellaria beds. The area of deposition of the Tanglewood has undergone several changes since the initial deposition of the member. Over time, due to rising sea levels or subsidence, the southwestern block came under deeper waters, as evidenced by the expansion of the shaley Brannon Member into the area. Later, an apparent reversal in the polarity of tectonic subduction at the Laurentia-Taconic boundary caused the entire horst-graben structure to invert - the formerly deep graben between the two Tanglewood horsts was raised, while the two horsts subsided, causing the area of deposition of the Tanglewood member to shift to the area previously associated with the Brannon member. This situation persisted until the end of Lexington time, when carbonate deposition in the area ended. = Brannon Member = Between the two Tanglewood horsts, an area of deeper water served as the environment of deposition for the Brannon Member. The unit is thickest in this area, reaching a thickness of about 6-8 meters, indicating that environmental conditions favorable to its deposition were present here for the longest amount of time. However, the Brannon Member was not limited purely to this graben structure - it gradually pinches out northeastward as well, and overlies the southwestern Tanglewood area, apparently as a result of its horst subsiding. It lies atop a hardground that was rapidly flooded by waters coming from the western Sebree trough. The rocks themselves consist of calcereous shale interbedded with thin, micro-grained limestones representing storm deposits. Since the unit was deposited in between two active faults, earthquakes would occasionally cause soft deformation to the rocks. = Perryville Limestone Member = While most of the central and northern part of the inner Bluegrass region was dominated by usually turbulent, nutrient-rich waters and a relief dotted with shoals, the southwest was shallower, calmer and had a poorer supply of nutrients due to being cut off from the more agitated northern waters by the aforementioned chain of Tanglewood member calcarenite bars. Unlike the Grier member, the Perryville member lacks authigenic phosphate, as the area's supply of nutrients was cut off. Although the steadily rising salinity and lack of nutrients were unfavorable to many members of the local biota, molluscs and algae were abundant. Fossils of the enigmatic Tetradium, now believed to be a type of red algae, are common throughout the facies, and the algae Girvanella coats many of the fossils. When the block underlying the southwest Tanglewood shoal zone sank, so too did the lagoons of the Perryvile Member. The formerly shallow, restricted waters gradually deepened and circulation improved, as evidenced by the Grier-like Cornishville bed, the topmost subunit of the member. = Sulphur Well Member = Once sea levels fell again, environmental conditions in the southwest became similar to those of the Grier Limestone and resulted in the deposition of the Sulphur Well Member. A notable characteristic that sets it apart from the Grier Limestone is the abundance of bryozoans, in particular the species Heterotrypa foliacea, which dominate the fossil content. = Devils Hollow Member = Following the aforementioned inversion of the horst-graben structure, the central graben was uplifted close to sea level. Once near the surface, a series of beaches began developing atop the block, which are today preserved as the Devils Hollow Member. It consists of two distinct types of rock - gastropod coquinites and calcilulite- calcisiltite rock. The coquinites represent the beach deposits themselves, while the calcilulite-calcisiltite rock represents lagoons that developed in shallow depressions in the beach landscape, likely no deeper than a few meters. = Stamping Ground Member = A stratigraphic unit both underlain and overlain by the Tanglewood Member, the Stamping Ground Member is similar to the Millersburg unit, but is unconnected to it and stratigraphically lower. Deposited in relatively shallow waters, it is rich in stromatoporoids, particularly Labechia huronensis. Red algae and brachiopods are also present. = Millersburg Member = In the areas surrounding the Tanglewood shoals, conditions remained optimal for the existence of a relatively rich ecosystem. The Millersburg Member was deposited in these areas. In terms of fossil content, it is similar to the stratigraphically lower Grier Member, but is lithologically distinct due to having a much higher shale content. Shale is abundant due to a general increase in terrigenous sediment influx towards the end of Lexington time, rather than depth like in the Logana and Brannon members. = Strodes Creek Member = This member is rather bouldery, owing to its pinch-and-swell bedding, ball-and-pillow structure, and abundant stromatoporoids. Fossils of other fauna are also present, but only sporadically and in lesser numbers.

In the late 70s and 80s, he moved increasingly into music and motion pictures. Biography Watt was born into a working-class family in the Fairmount neighborhood of Philadelphia. His father, Martin, was a civil servant, and his mother, Claire, was a housewife and semi-professional lounge singer. He attended Frankford High School in Philadelphia, but left before graduating to pursue a career in the arts. Interested in poetry from an early age, Watt had begun composing his own poems, influenced by such authors as \\"...Keats, Shakespeare, and the old anonymous ballads\\" rather than by the Beat Generation poets so in vogue at the time. Watt published intermittently throughout the early and mid-1970s in independent Philadelphia magazines and literary journals such as CONTACT, where his work appeared alongside that of Ted Berrigan, Tom Pickard and Otis Brown. But it was for his live performances that Watt gained wider notoriety. Initially in his native Philadelphia, but later in Washington and New York, Watt built a steady following and drew strong reviews for shows which challenged audience expectations as to what a ‚Äúpoetry reading‚Äù was. Alan Kriegsman of The Washington Post said Watt ‚Äúcreated an unclassifiable format of his own. Part recital, part sideshow, part seance. To call it a poetry reading would be like calling King Kong a nature film.‚Äù His performances displayed an interest in stagecraft seldom seen in the conventional poetry reading- sound effects, lighting effects, specially built sets, props, costume design, as well as the occasional use of backup ‚Äúsingers‚Äù-all used in accompaniment to Watt's recital from memory, sometimes delivered rapidfire, other times resembling the apparent loose spontaneity of a stand-up comedian. In Philadelphia, Watt had successful runs at Etage, the Mask and Wig Club, the Wilma Theater, and the Painted Bride, among others. In Washington D.C. he appeared at the Washington Project for the Arts in late January 1976, the three night series of performances being praised in both the Washington Post and the (now defunct) Washington Star. As he increasingly integrated music into his performances, Watt ultimately formed a band with a number of Philadelphia musicians. Part of New York's ‚Äúno wave‚Äù school, and influenced by Jamaican ‚ÄúDub-style‚Äù reggae vocalists, the band was fronted by Watt and included an evolving series of musicians, (among them Paul Dugan, Hank Ransome, and Chris Larkin) They performed under various names in New York and Philadelphia area venues, and recorded one never released album. The band's material was based on poems, or fragments of same, written by Watt and set to music composed by various other components of the band. In 1982, Watt collaborated with painter and graphic artist Matt Marello on Marty Watt Is Not Matt Marello and Vice Verse (Wax Bean/Go Home Productions, 1982), a book of Watt poems illustrated by Marello. In 1985, Watt starred in the motion picture Almost You, a romantic comedy set in New York. The film included the performance of one of Watt's own poems, ‚ÄúIt Really Slits My Throat‚Äù. Watt also wrote the lyrics to the film's closing credit theme ‚ÄúCloser to Near Than Far.‚Äù Marty Watt performing World Made of Flies Marty Watt band performing song Ungawa  References   External links  * Hallwalls, Buffalo N.Y. 1980 * Marty Watt at Painted Bride Philadelphia Underground Festival * It Really Slits My Throat from Almost You * Soundcloud poetry files Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:American male film actors Category:American male musicians Category:American musicians Category:American performance artists Category:American male poets Category:American spoken word artists Category:Male actors from Philadelphia ","title":"Marty Watt"},{"id":"43128089","text":"Charles Pfeiffer Alm (born March 27, 1937) is an American rower who competed at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy.

Biography  Joseph Naso was born on January 7, 1934 in Rochester, New York. After serving in the U.S. Air Force in the 1950s, he met his first wife Judith. Their marriage lasted for 18 years, but after the divorce Naso continued visiting his ex-wife who lived in the Bay Area. The couple had a son named Charles who later developed schizophrenia, and Naso spent his later years caring for him. Naso took classes in various San Francisco colleges in the 1970s and lived in the Mission District of San Francisco and then in Piedmont, California in the 1980s. He lived in Sacramento between 1999 and 2003, and finally settled in Reno, Nevada in 2004, where he was arrested in 2011. He worked as a freelance photographer and had a long history of petty crimes such as shoplifting, which he committed even in his mid-seventies. His acquaintances nicknamed him \\"Crazy Joe\\" for his behavior.  Victims  * Roxenne Roggasch was found dead on January 10, 1977, her body dumped near Fairfax, California. She was 18 years old and stood 5'2\\". She had been strangled. Police estimated she was killed less than a day before. Police suspected that Roggasch had worked as a sex worker, but her family denied this. * Carmen Lorraine Colon, 22, was found on August 13, 1978, along Carquinez Scenic Highway, a road between Crockett and Port Costa, just thirty miles from the body of the first victim. A Highway Patrol officer investigating reports of a cattle shooting found a decomposing nude body that had been dumped. The body was later identified as Colon's. * The body of Shariea Lefern Johnson Patton, 56, washed ashore near the Naval Net Depot in Tiburon, California in 1981. At the time of her death, she was a resident of the Bay Area looking for a job. Naso managed the residence where the woman used to live. He also took a photo of the victim. He was considered the prime suspect by police in 1981, but gave the investigators only elusive answers and was not charged for the next thirty years. * Sarah Dylan, a Bob Dylan groupie (born Renee Shapiro, she later changed her name to that of the idol's former wife), was last seen on her way to a Dylan concert at the Warfield theater in San Francisco in May 1992. She was killed in or near Nevada County, California. * In 1993, the body of Pamela Ruth Parsons, a waitress, was found in Yuba County, California. She was 38. Parsons worked near Cooper Avenue in Yuba City, where Naso lived at that time. * Tracy Lynn McKinney Tafoya was found dead in 1994, also in Yuba County. She was 31. The killer drugged, raped and strangled her, and left the body near Marysville Cemetery. It has been estimated that a week passed before the body was found.  Arrest, trial and conviction  Nevada parole and probation authorities arrested Naso in April 2010. During a search of his home, authorities discovered a handwritten diary in which Naso listed ten unnamed women with geographical locations. On April 11, 2011, he was charged with the murders of Roggasch, Colon, Parsons and Tafoya. All four victims were listed by the police as sex workers. The other six women mentioned in the diary remained unidentified. Later, prosecutors Dori Ahana and Rosemary Sloat introduced evidence identifying Patton and Dylan. On August 20, 2013, Naso was convicted by a Marin County jury of the murders. On November 22, 2013, a Marin County judge sentenced him to death for the murders. Naso was also a person of interest in the Rochester Alphabet murders of 1971‚Äì73 case, since four of his victims bore double initials, just as the Rochester murder victims, and Naso had lived there for a long time. Naso, however, was ruled out of that case when DNA found on Californian victims was not matched to the DNA found on a Rochester victim's body.

It won prizes at the second Rh√∂n competition held on the Wasserkuppe in 1921. Design and development The Sb.1 was designed by two engineering students from the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen (Technical University of Munich), Ernst von L√∂√ül/Loessl, (cousin of Eugen von Loessl killed at the Wasserkuppe on 9 August 1920) and Albert Finsterwalder. It was built by them with the assistance of the Munich branch of the Bayern Gliding Club during the winter of 1920-21. They were aware of the high-wing monoplane gliders that had been under development by Friedrich Harth, assisted by the teenage Willy Messerschmitt, since before 1915. By about 1920 Harth was convinced that long glider flights depended on energy capture from gusts (ridge and thermal lift was undiscovered) and the Harth-Messerschmitt designs were controlled in pitch by a variable angle of incidence wing and roll by wing warping. Its pilot had two levers, one for roll and the other for pitch. The tailplane was fixed. L√∂√ül and Finsterwalder took these ideas a stage further by making the wings separately rotatable and controlled with a conventional column, which when moved sideways rotated the wings in opposite directions. The fixed tailplane was retained but the conventional fin and rudder of the Harth-Messerschmitt was entirely removed; instead, yaw was controlled by the opening above and below the wing of little wing tip trailing edge double split flap airbrakes. This last feature did not work well so the brakes were replaced by a conventional, rectangular rudder; this was further modified later by adding a triangular tip, forming a balanced rudder. At the same time a fixed fin was added. The Sb.1 had an open frame fuselage. A beam less than about long served as a landing skid and supported the controls and the pilot's seat in front of a square cross-section fairing which converged in boat-tail fashion in plan and elevation to a point only a short distance aft of the skid. From the beam a pair of struts converged above the wing, the rear one almost vertical. Two pairs of steel tube struts, attached to the top and bottom of the rear upright, spread out into Vs to support the rectangular plan tailplane. The rest of the structure was wire-braced. The glider had a wire- braced, wooden, two part, three spar wing with the first spar forming the leading edge and the second the axis of rotation. The wings had constant chord out to angled tips and a thick (16.7%) section. Like the tail surfaces, they were fabric covered. Each leading edge was linked by a short forward extension of the control column by a vertical, outward leaning pushrod providing rotations of up to ¬±10¬∞. Operational history The second Rh√∂n competition, held in 1921, attracted 46 entries, many more than in the previous year. About half arrived at the Wasserkuppe and not all of these flew. Prizes were awarded for total time in the air (same pilot, duration more than 15 seconds), minimum loss of height in a flight lasting more than 60 seconds) and greatest distance flown. A grand prize for the greatest flight duration lasting more than 5 minutes with a specified maximum altitude loss was not awarded. Flown by Karl Koller, the Munich aircraft was very successful and was awarded first prize in the height loss and distance flown categories. Koller's greatest distance in one flight was . He was runner-up to Willi Pelzner in the duration category; Pelzner flew 57 flights on his own hang glider and 5 on the North-Baverian Aviation Society biplane. Nonetheless, Koller's total time of 31.6 minutes was made in only 25 flights and his average duration (76 seconds) was more than double that of the winner. The Hannover Vampyr would have out-flown the others had it not been damaged after only a few flights, as its post-competition performance demonstrated. At the next Rh√∂n there were fifty-three entrants, ten of which had wings with adjustable incidence angles, including a Harth- Messerschmitt monoplane and the F.V.D. Doris. The winner of the valuable Great Rh√∂n Sailing Prize, the Hannover Vampyr which flew for over three hours, was not one of the ten.
